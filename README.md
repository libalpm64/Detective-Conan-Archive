# The Detective Conan Archival Project

Rather than providing videos, this is a comprehensive script to watch Detective Conan for English viewers (and others if you use API translations).

Note that these are all remasters. The remasters are significantly higher quality but come at the cost of file size. The file size is ~1.2 TB for the entire series.

To see requirements please check `requirements.md`.

## Legal Notice
To denote, this is for archival purposes only. We are not promoting piracy and it is illegal under international law. Please keep this in mind when running this script that you must have a license from the official sources and depending on that license from the streaming provider you may or may not distribute these EPs in any capacity.

## Notes on Remasters
There is a current English dub effort going on. The new episodes that are dubbed are:  
1-5, 7, 10, 43, 48-49, 57-58, 76, 128-129, 176-178, 230-231, 286-288, 345, 425

This option will be toggleable. If you are not a fan of the dub, avoid using the CR remaster releases. The file size is large and of a lower quality.
