1
00:00:01,465 --> 00:00:02,965
A showdown.

2
00:00:04,065 --> 00:00:06,065
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:06,065 --> 00:00:08,365
The life of a person and a picture disappeared from a locked room.

4
00:00:08,365 --> 00:00:10,465
Could this be the work of that guy who puts on airs, too?

5
00:00:10,465 --> 00:00:11,865
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:13,365
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,365 --> 00:00:15,365
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,582 --> 00:02:01,382
Kogoro Mouri?

9
00:02:01,382 --> 00:02:02,382
Yes.

10
00:02:03,482 --> 00:02:06,682
Why did you call that famous detective here?

11
00:02:06,682 --> 00:02:08,182
Of course.

12
00:02:08,182 --> 00:02:10,282
Father, the thief is after it.

13
00:02:10,282 --> 00:02:12,982
After it? After what?

14
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:14,382
Naturally,

15
00:02:14,382 --> 00:02:17,882
it's my new painting that the world of art has been waiting to see.

16
00:02:17,882 --> 00:02:21,482
My painting, which is to follow "Red Lotus", "Gold", and "Pure White",

17
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:22,682
and "Blue Storm" here.

18
00:02:25,782 --> 00:02:28,382
And in order to get a hold of this,

19
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:32,282
he will fly here and appear from the darkness,

20
00:02:32,282 --> 00:02:35,782
the so-called magician under the moon, the great and well-known,

21
00:02:35,782 --> 00:02:37,982
Thief Kid.

22
00:02:37,982 --> 00:02:39,082
What?

23
00:02:39,082 --> 00:02:41,082
The notice arrived this morning.

24
00:02:41,082 --> 00:02:44,482
"Tomorrow at 20:00, under the light of the full moon,

25
00:02:44,482 --> 00:02:46,482
I shall appear to get the 'Blue Storm' painting."

26
00:02:46,482 --> 00:02:48,582
This is a warning of theft.

27
00:02:48,582 --> 00:02:51,182
Oh, no. We've got to do something.

28
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:54,082
Of course, I've already contacted the police.

29
00:02:54,082 --> 00:02:58,482
But he's an elusive, kaleidoscopic and unflawed magician.

30
00:02:58,482 --> 00:03:00,582
I don't know if we'll succeed in protecting the painting.

31
00:03:00,582 --> 00:03:04,882
No, that's not what I'm worried about.

32
00:03:04,882 --> 00:03:07,682
With all this fuss, what if someone finds out about it?

33
00:03:07,682 --> 00:03:10,982
No one will find out.

34
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,582
Forever.

35
00:03:14,682 --> 00:03:16,882
Don't tell me that you, Takeyori...

36
00:03:16,882 --> 00:03:20,382
Yes, I couldn't think of a better way to work things out.

37
00:03:20,382 --> 00:03:22,082
Don't do it, Takeyori.

38
00:03:22,082 --> 00:03:24,582
Stop whatever you're trying to do.

39
00:03:24,582 --> 00:03:28,082
Do you have any right to say something like that?

40
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:31,482
This is all happening because of you, father.

41
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:36,982
If you insist, I've got something on my mind, too.

42
00:03:39,582 --> 00:03:41,582
I'm only kidding.

43
00:03:41,582 --> 00:03:44,082
I was just trying to put on a mean act.

44
00:03:44,082 --> 00:03:47,682
After all, I'm a world famous artist.

45
00:03:47,682 --> 00:03:50,082
I would never do something like that.

46
00:03:50,082 --> 00:03:52,482
Then, is the notice was a joke as well?

47
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,182
No, this was indeed delivered here.

48
00:03:55,182 --> 00:03:56,582
But no need to worry.

49
00:03:56,582 --> 00:03:59,082
Thief Kid always never get to steal whatever he's after

50
00:03:59,082 --> 00:04:01,582
if Detective Mouri is around.

51
00:04:01,582 --> 00:04:06,782
See, thanks to the work of the little boy that is with him.

52
00:04:06,782 --> 00:04:09,482
I'm sure he'll protect the painting for us this time, too.

53
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:12,682
That boy called Conan Edogawa.

54
00:04:14,082 --> 00:04:19,982
"Thief Kid and the Four Masterpieces (Part 1)"

55
00:04:22,882 --> 00:04:24,882
How about it, Conan?

56
00:04:24,882 --> 00:04:27,382
This will be your third confrontation with Thief Kid.

57
00:04:27,382 --> 00:04:28,982
Do you think you can outdo him?

58
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:30,582
I wonder?

59
00:04:30,582 --> 00:04:34,182
I can't tell unless I actually confront him, but I don't think I'll lose.

60
00:04:34,182 --> 00:04:35,482
It's not my third time either.

61
00:04:36,682 --> 00:04:39,982
So you've confronted him more times than is written in the papers?

62
00:04:39,982 --> 00:04:42,382
What's the secret to outdoing Thief Kid?

63
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:43,982
It's not that I always outdid him.

64
00:04:43,982 --> 00:04:45,182
Of course, it's all due

65
00:04:45,182 --> 00:04:49,082
to the daily training sessions taught by me, Kogoro Mouri.

66
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:50,882
Hey, you're that famous detective!

67
00:04:50,882 --> 00:04:52,482
Then he sure is tried and tested!

68
00:04:53,582 --> 00:04:54,682
So, famed detective,

69
00:04:54,682 --> 00:04:56,182
what is your prospect of victory?

70
00:04:56,182 --> 00:04:58,682
Victory over that greatest thief under the heavens?

71
00:04:58,682 --> 00:05:01,082
There's no such thing.

72
00:05:01,082 --> 00:05:04,382
I can make him taste bitterness, though.

73
00:05:04,382 --> 00:05:05,682
He'll suffer!

74
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:07,382
Victory and bitterness?

75
00:05:07,382 --> 00:05:08,982
Well, well.

76
00:05:08,982 --> 00:05:12,082
Hey, what did you come here for? To joke around?

77
00:05:12,082 --> 00:05:13,582
Inspector Nakamori.

78
00:05:13,582 --> 00:05:16,182
This is the place Thief Kid warned he would appear.

79
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:19,482
You go on ahead with Megure and investigate the murder!

80
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:21,582
I hate to say this, Inspector Nakamori,

81
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:24,582
but I came to this villa

82
00:05:24,582 --> 00:05:28,682
because Mr. Oikawa received a warning from Thief Kid.

83
00:05:28,682 --> 00:05:31,382
Inspector, are the police fully prepared?

84
00:05:31,382 --> 00:05:34,882
Why is Thief Kid, who only goes after jewellery, is now after a painting?

85
00:05:34,882 --> 00:05:36,782
There's a rumour claiming that the notice itself was a hoax.

86
00:05:36,782 --> 00:05:37,982
What do you think?

87
00:05:37,982 --> 00:05:39,882
No comment!

88
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:43,782
Press people, let me warn you again to stay away from the site!

89
00:05:43,782 --> 00:05:46,182
But the new painting by Mr. Oikawa called "Blue Storm"

90
00:05:46,182 --> 00:05:50,282
is scheduled to be aired publicly on TV soon.

91
00:05:50,282 --> 00:05:51,282
Isn't that right?

92
00:05:51,282 --> 00:05:52,282
Yeah.

93
00:05:52,282 --> 00:05:54,182
The painting is already completed.

94
00:05:54,182 --> 00:05:56,582
And he's going to sign it on air.

95
00:05:56,582 --> 00:06:00,082
That is if the painting is not stolen by Thief Kid.

96
00:06:00,082 --> 00:06:03,982
What? You're talking like it's already been stolen, aren't you?

97
00:06:03,982 --> 00:06:05,182
Not really...

98
00:06:05,182 --> 00:06:08,082
Anyway, Thief Kid warned that he'd appear at 20:00 tonight.

99
00:06:08,082 --> 00:06:09,982
Until then and until the painting is confirmed to be safe,

100
00:06:09,982 --> 00:06:12,082
don't ever go inside!

101
00:06:12,082 --> 00:06:13,382
Do you understand?

102
00:06:14,982 --> 00:06:17,182
I've been waiting for you, Mr. Mouri.

103
00:06:17,182 --> 00:06:19,782
I'm Takeyori Oikawa.

104
00:06:19,782 --> 00:06:21,182
Hello.

105
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:23,082
But was it really all right

106
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:25,082
for me to bring my daughter and this boy along?

107
00:06:25,082 --> 00:06:27,382
Well, if you'd rather not have us here,

108
00:06:27,382 --> 00:06:30,382
Conan and I will wait in the car outside.

109
00:06:30,382 --> 00:06:32,582
We have no problem on having you guys here.

110
00:06:32,582 --> 00:06:34,882
I trust Detective Mouri.

111
00:06:34,882 --> 00:06:36,182
Thank you very much.

112
00:06:36,182 --> 00:06:41,182
And besides, this boy here seems to know that thief well.

113
00:06:41,182 --> 00:06:43,282
Let me start by showing you around then.

114
00:06:43,282 --> 00:06:45,382
First, I'll take you to the atelier where the "Blue Storm" is.

115
00:06:45,382 --> 00:06:46,882
Come this way please.

116
00:06:46,882 --> 00:06:48,182
Takeyori.

117
00:06:48,182 --> 00:06:49,982
Could I have a word with you?

118
00:06:49,982 --> 00:06:53,582
I'm sorry. But can it wait till later, father?

119
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:56,782
Is he your father?

120
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:58,982
Yes, he is my father-in-law,

121
00:06:58,982 --> 00:07:01,982
as well as my teacher, Haruhito Kanbara.

122
00:07:01,982 --> 00:07:05,082
Would it sound better if I pronounced his name as "Seijin"?

123
00:07:05,082 --> 00:07:07,482
Oh, the famous landscape painter.

124
00:07:07,482 --> 00:07:10,482
But ever since he hurt his hand 10 years ago,

125
00:07:10,482 --> 00:07:12,582
he hasn't held the paint brush.

126
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:18,382
Please come this way, here's the room.

127
00:07:20,782 --> 00:07:22,982
It's a nice atelier.

128
00:07:22,982 --> 00:07:24,982
Just as would be expected of Okutama,

129
00:07:24,982 --> 00:07:27,282
there is nothing but mountains outside.

130
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:32,582
There are five members from the Riot Task Force below the window.

131
00:07:32,582 --> 00:07:35,482
It's difficult to break in from here.

132
00:07:35,482 --> 00:07:37,882
He can also use a hand glider,

133
00:07:37,882 --> 00:07:41,082
but all the windows seem to be locked.

134
00:07:41,082 --> 00:07:43,282
Could this be the painting in question?

135
00:07:43,282 --> 00:07:45,182
Yes, it's the "Blue Storm".

136
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:47,082
I'd like to take a quick peek at it.

137
00:07:47,082 --> 00:07:48,482
No, Mr. Mouri.

138
00:07:49,682 --> 00:07:53,882
I don't like people seeing my work before its completion.

139
00:07:53,882 --> 00:07:56,482
But all there's left to do is for you to sign it, right?

140
00:07:56,482 --> 00:07:59,482
No, I'd like to still do touch ups here and there.

141
00:07:59,482 --> 00:08:00,982
I see.

142
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:03,382
But with a plaster bust here,

143
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,482
it sort of looks like the art room at school.

144
00:08:05,482 --> 00:08:09,082
I have art class once a week here.

145
00:08:10,982 --> 00:08:13,282
Is that a surveillance camera?

146
00:08:13,282 --> 00:08:15,482
Yes. It was put there immediately

147
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:17,682
after we received the warning from Thief Kid.

148
00:08:17,682 --> 00:08:21,482
Would you like to take a look at the images in it?

149
00:08:21,482 --> 00:08:22,882
Let's go to the first floor, then.

150
00:08:26,482 --> 00:08:30,582
There are two doors and there are two guards watching each door.

151
00:08:30,582 --> 00:08:33,682
Moreover, they all have pinch marks on their cheeks.

152
00:08:33,682 --> 00:08:36,482
I guess that means Inspector Nakamori has already checked them out.

153
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:40,882
Listen! It's only 30 minutes to 20:00, the time of the warning.

154
00:08:40,882 --> 00:08:43,782
All of you, stay fully alert and guard the place!

155
00:08:43,782 --> 00:08:46,482
Oh, so this is the image of that...

156
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:49,482
It definitely has a clear view of the painting in question,

157
00:08:49,482 --> 00:08:50,982
but why's there only one camera?

158
00:08:50,982 --> 00:08:53,782
I also heard that there was a surveillance camera here,

159
00:08:53,782 --> 00:08:55,882
but I didn't think there would only be one.

160
00:08:55,882 --> 00:08:58,882
I'm sorry if I didn't seem to get the correct message across.

161
00:08:58,882 --> 00:09:02,882
Why aren't you letting the guards into the atelier?

162
00:09:02,882 --> 00:09:05,082
I won't allow anyone in there.

163
00:09:05,082 --> 00:09:07,882
It's possible they could peek at my painting like Mr. Mouri almost did.

164
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:10,682
None of my men would do anything like that.

165
00:09:10,682 --> 00:09:13,682
Well, having one camera is better than nothing though.

166
00:09:13,682 --> 00:09:15,382
That's right.

167
00:09:15,382 --> 00:09:18,882
Could I have you turn that camera off for a little while?

168
00:09:18,882 --> 00:09:19,882
Huh?

169
00:09:19,882 --> 00:09:22,482
I want to check my painting, so for just about 10 minutes.

170
00:09:22,482 --> 00:09:26,582
But it's less than 30 minutes to the time of the warning.

171
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:28,682
Please let me borrow this transceiver.

172
00:09:28,682 --> 00:09:30,982
I'll contact you as soon as I finish checking it.

173
00:09:35,882 --> 00:09:37,282
Roger.

174
00:09:37,282 --> 00:09:39,382
Please go ahead inside.

175
00:09:39,382 --> 00:09:41,782
-Thank you. -Takeyori.

176
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:43,082
Father.

177
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,682
Could I have a word with you now?

178
00:09:44,682 --> 00:09:48,282
I'm going to do a final check on my painting.

179
00:09:48,282 --> 00:09:50,982
I already told you that I have something in mind too, didn't I?

180
00:09:50,982 --> 00:09:52,382
I'll be done right away.

181
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:54,182
So let's talk later.

182
00:09:54,182 --> 00:09:56,482
Would you wait here a while for me?

183
00:09:59,282 --> 00:10:01,382
He's late. He's too late.

184
00:10:01,382 --> 00:10:04,382
What is he doing? It's been more than 10 minutes since he went in.

185
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:06,682
I've finished checking, Inspector.

186
00:10:06,682 --> 00:10:08,482
You may turn on the surveillance camera.

187
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,482
-Okay, turn it on. -Yes, sir.

188
00:10:10,482 --> 00:10:13,082
How is it? Is it working?

189
00:10:13,082 --> 00:10:16,582
Yes. Please hurry out of that room.

190
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:17,582
Yes, sir.

191
00:10:20,782 --> 00:10:22,982
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, father.

192
00:10:22,982 --> 00:10:28,182
I would like to see the famed painting that Thief Kid is after.

193
00:10:28,182 --> 00:10:30,482
I heard it's a masterpiece of a set of four paintings.

194
00:10:30,482 --> 00:10:32,082
A set of four paintings?

195
00:10:32,082 --> 00:10:34,282
The first piece is "Red Lotus", a flower.

196
00:10:34,282 --> 00:10:36,382
The second one is "Gold", that stands for moon.

197
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:38,482
The third, "Pure White" stands for a bird.

198
00:10:38,482 --> 00:10:40,982
And the fourth, the one that Thief Kid is after is "Blue Storm"

199
00:10:40,982 --> 00:10:42,882
and it stands for wind.

200
00:10:42,882 --> 00:10:45,382
I see. Flowers, birds, wind and the moon.

201
00:10:45,382 --> 00:10:49,782
I see. He's trying to express the beauty of nature with his four paintings.

202
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:53,082
I can sort of understand flower, the moon and the wind.

203
00:10:53,082 --> 00:10:54,982
But how come "Pure White" stands for bird?

204
00:10:54,982 --> 00:10:56,382
It's a crane bird.

205
00:10:56,382 --> 00:11:01,582
It's a painting of a red-crested white crane standing in the snow.

206
00:11:01,582 --> 00:11:05,382
A rich person auctioned his previous three paintings for a high price,

207
00:11:05,382 --> 00:11:07,482
and it seems the same person is waiting for this fourth one, too.

208
00:11:08,682 --> 00:11:10,482
-A blackout! -The breaker!

209
00:11:10,482 --> 00:11:12,082
Somebody go check the breaker!

210
00:11:12,082 --> 00:11:13,982
I'll go to the atelier upstairs!

211
00:11:13,982 --> 00:11:16,682
-Close off all the entrances and exits! -Yes, sir.

212
00:11:16,682 --> 00:11:17,982
Don't tell me it's Thief Kid?

213
00:11:17,982 --> 00:11:20,982
There's still more than 10 minutes before the time of the warning.

214
00:11:20,982 --> 00:11:23,382
Father, are you all right?

215
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,682
What is it? What's up?

216
00:11:24,682 --> 00:11:26,382
Please answer me!

217
00:11:26,382 --> 00:11:29,182
It blacked out and the old man is still in there.

218
00:11:29,182 --> 00:11:30,982
How did he get inside the room?

219
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:33,782
He came in when I was leaving the room.

220
00:11:33,782 --> 00:11:36,082
He came in saying that he can't trust the police or the detective,

221
00:11:36,082 --> 00:11:38,282
so he's going to guard the painting himself.

222
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:39,582
Since he's a stubborn man,

223
00:11:39,582 --> 00:11:41,782
I figured its better that I ask you, Inspector,

224
00:11:41,782 --> 00:11:43,782
to persuade him to lock the door and was about to go call you

225
00:11:43,782 --> 00:11:45,582
when the lights suddenly went out.

226
00:11:45,582 --> 00:11:46,982
And where's the key?

227
00:11:46,982 --> 00:11:49,782
I was in a rush to open the door and dropped it some place.

228
00:11:49,782 --> 00:11:50,782
Darn it!

229
00:11:50,782 --> 00:11:52,282
Let's break the door down.

230
00:11:52,282 --> 00:11:53,682
-One, two... -One, two...

231
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:56,482
What the...

232
00:11:58,182 --> 00:11:59,682
Shoots!

233
00:11:59,682 --> 00:12:00,982
He escaped from the window!

234
00:12:00,982 --> 00:12:02,382
What's the situation outside?

235
00:12:02,382 --> 00:12:05,982
Well, a lot of paint brushes and brush stands came falling.

236
00:12:05,982 --> 00:12:08,382
There was no one in sight at all.

237
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:10,182
Look! The painting's gone!

238
00:12:11,582 --> 00:12:15,882
Right. It disappeared as if it were an illusion.

239
00:12:15,882 --> 00:12:17,482
Father.

240
00:12:17,482 --> 00:12:18,782
Get a hold of yourself.

241
00:12:18,782 --> 00:12:19,882
Father!

242
00:12:19,882 --> 00:12:23,282
Together with the old man's dead body

243
00:12:23,282 --> 00:12:25,082
covered with blood as bright red as a lotus flower.

244
00:12:25,082 --> 00:12:26,582
Father!

245
00:12:31,887 --> 00:12:34,287
Thief Kid committed murder?

246
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:37,287
But Thief Kid doesn't kill, does he?

247
00:12:37,287 --> 00:12:38,487
I'm not sure.

248
00:12:38,487 --> 00:12:40,587
If Thief Kid did commit murder,

249
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:43,087
it's going to take a while to report, won't it?

250
00:12:43,087 --> 00:12:45,387
Yes. If worse comes to worst, it may take more than a day.

251
00:12:45,387 --> 00:12:46,987
Hey, you over there!

252
00:12:46,987 --> 00:12:47,987
If you're free,

253
00:12:47,987 --> 00:12:51,087
would you please go get me a drink from the broadcast van?

254
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:52,887
Yes, sure.

255
00:12:52,887 --> 00:12:54,087
Got it.

256
00:12:56,887 --> 00:12:57,887
Here he is.

257
00:13:02,787 --> 00:13:04,087
Inspector Megure!

258
00:13:04,087 --> 00:13:07,787
I heard that a murder's been committed, but did Thief Kid do it?

259
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,987
Could there have been a problem with the security measures?

260
00:13:09,987 --> 00:13:12,687
No comment. No comment!

261
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:17,087
But is it true that Mr. Oikawa's new painting "Blue Storm" was stolen?

262
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:20,887
Could it be that you're assuming that Thief Kid would never kill?

263
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:22,287
I said no comment!

264
00:13:22,287 --> 00:13:23,487
Can you comment on the investigation so far?

265
00:13:23,487 --> 00:13:25,187
Please tell us!

266
00:13:25,187 --> 00:13:27,287
Hey, just where do you think you're touching?

267
00:13:28,187 --> 00:13:31,487
A knife and stun gun were used to commit the murder.

268
00:13:31,487 --> 00:13:34,487
There are traces of a stun gun on his neck.

269
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:37,787
He probably realized that Mr. Kanbara was there when he was stealing.

270
00:13:37,787 --> 00:13:39,487
He then used the stun gun to pass him out.

271
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:41,687
And since the culprit feared that his face was seen,

272
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,187
he stabbed Mr. Kanbara with the knife and killed him.

273
00:13:44,187 --> 00:13:45,787
And what about the fingerprints?

274
00:13:45,787 --> 00:13:48,287
Nothing was found on the stun gun,

275
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:51,287
but Mr. Oikawa's fingerprints were found on the handle of the knife.

276
00:13:51,287 --> 00:13:53,587
Then don't tell me that he...

277
00:13:53,587 --> 00:13:54,687
No.

278
00:13:54,687 --> 00:13:56,387
It would've been impossible for him

279
00:13:56,387 --> 00:14:00,587
to find someone the in the dark without any light source

280
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:02,687
and kill him in such a short time.

281
00:14:02,687 --> 00:14:05,887
He said he heard Mr. Kanbara groaning and coincidentally found him.

282
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:10,587
He then carried Mr. Kanbara and seemed to have touched the knife then.

283
00:14:10,587 --> 00:14:13,687
That's the reason why his fingerprints were detected on the knife.

284
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:16,987
The culprit escaped after kicking the paint brush stands out of the window

285
00:14:16,987 --> 00:14:18,987
when I came into the room after breaking the door down.

286
00:14:18,987 --> 00:14:22,687
Which means that the culprit was in the room from before the blackout?

287
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:25,487
Yeah, he was probably hiding in the attic or something

288
00:14:25,487 --> 00:14:26,687
and as soon as the lights went out,

289
00:14:26,687 --> 00:14:29,287
he probably came out of that air conditioner and snuck in.

290
00:14:29,287 --> 00:14:31,387
How did he black the place out?

291
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:32,487
A timer was probably set

292
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:36,187
so that appliances that eat a lot of electricity all turned on at once,

293
00:14:36,187 --> 00:14:38,187
causing the fuse to blow.

294
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:39,587
Maybe if we checked more carefully,

295
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,587
we could've found it beforehand.

296
00:14:41,587 --> 00:14:45,387
But Mr. Oikawa received the warning only yesterday morning,

297
00:14:45,387 --> 00:14:48,987
and we received the report last night.

298
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:51,787
Which means, the warning was sent out

299
00:14:51,787 --> 00:14:53,687
after everything had been prepared.

300
00:14:53,687 --> 00:14:57,087
And? Did you see the culprit escape from the window?

301
00:14:57,087 --> 00:14:59,287
No. In preparation for intruders from outside,

302
00:14:59,287 --> 00:15:02,087
I ordered the lights shining on the window to be subdued.

303
00:15:02,087 --> 00:15:03,487
Since it was too bright,

304
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:06,387
it would be like telling the thief where the painting is.

305
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:10,487
The only thing we got is the two paint brush stands

306
00:15:10,487 --> 00:15:12,087
and a huge number of paint brushes that came falling

307
00:15:12,087 --> 00:15:13,687
when the culprit escaped from the window.

308
00:15:15,487 --> 00:15:17,387
Okay, Megure. You can take things from here.

309
00:15:17,387 --> 00:15:19,887
Look through the images in the surveillance camera

310
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:21,387
and arrest the culprit, will you?

311
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,987
Hey, hey. The one who did it is Thief Kid, isn't it?

312
00:15:23,987 --> 00:15:25,587
You're in charge of this case, aren't you?

313
00:15:25,587 --> 00:15:27,887
This case isn't connected to Thief Kid.

314
00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:30,687
He never takes a person's life.

315
00:15:31,687 --> 00:15:32,987
Inspector Megure.

316
00:15:32,987 --> 00:15:35,287
The video images from the atelier's surveillance camera

317
00:15:35,287 --> 00:15:36,787
are ready to be played.

318
00:15:36,787 --> 00:15:39,387
This is an hour before the incident.

319
00:15:39,387 --> 00:15:42,187
This is right after Mr. Oikawa checked his painting.

320
00:15:42,187 --> 00:15:45,987
And this is the image right after when the lights are turned back on.

321
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:49,487
I can see that the images are cut off before and after the blackout,

322
00:15:49,487 --> 00:15:52,787
but why is there a cut before and after he checked the painting?

323
00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:56,087
I asked them to turn the camera off.

324
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:58,787
If anyone sees the painting before it's completed,

325
00:15:58,787 --> 00:16:02,187
all the feelings I put into it would vanish.

326
00:16:02,187 --> 00:16:04,387
I've been doing so from long ago.

327
00:16:04,387 --> 00:16:06,287
According to Inspector Nakamori's story,

328
00:16:06,287 --> 00:16:09,887
after you finished checking your painting, Mr. Kanbara came into the room.

329
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:11,087
Yes.

330
00:16:11,087 --> 00:16:13,587
He said that he couldn't trust the police or detective

331
00:16:13,587 --> 00:16:15,987
and insisted that he'd guard the painting himself.

332
00:16:15,987 --> 00:16:18,087
Father is a very stubborn person

333
00:16:18,087 --> 00:16:19,987
and it didn't seem like I could persuade him,

334
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:23,087
so I thought I'd have Inspector Nakamori convince him.

335
00:16:23,087 --> 00:16:26,087
For the sake of my father's safety, I locked the door

336
00:16:26,087 --> 00:16:29,787
and went to call Inspector Nakamori when there was a sudden blackout.

337
00:16:29,787 --> 00:16:31,487
Since father didn't answer,

338
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,887
I rushed to open the door,

339
00:16:33,887 --> 00:16:35,787
but I mistakenly dropped the key

340
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,487
and couldn't find it right away.

341
00:16:37,487 --> 00:16:38,587
I see.

342
00:16:38,587 --> 00:16:42,787
So that's why Inspector Nakamori decided to break the door open.

343
00:16:42,787 --> 00:16:45,287
-But isn't it strange? -Huh?

344
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:48,187
Because after you finished checking your painting,

345
00:16:48,187 --> 00:16:50,087
you're talking on the transceiver.

346
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:51,587
Although your voice can't be heard,

347
00:16:51,587 --> 00:16:54,887
you asked Inspector Nakamori to turn the surveillance camera back on

348
00:16:54,887 --> 00:16:56,987
since you finished checking your painting, right?

349
00:16:56,987 --> 00:16:58,587
Yes.

350
00:16:58,587 --> 00:17:01,187
If Mr. Kanbara came in at that time,

351
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,787
all you had to do was use the transceiver

352
00:17:02,787 --> 00:17:04,087
to ask Inspector Nakamori to come, right?

353
00:17:04,087 --> 00:17:08,087
Well, father snatched the transceiver away from me,

354
00:17:08,087 --> 00:17:10,587
saying that he didn't want to be interrupted by anyone.

355
00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:12,387
It seems that the transceiver

356
00:17:12,387 --> 00:17:15,687
was found in Mr. Kanbara's pocket a while later.

357
00:17:15,687 --> 00:17:16,787
Yeah.

358
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:19,187
But can't we think of it this way?

359
00:17:19,187 --> 00:17:21,987
When it blacked out, Mr. Kanbara decided to protect the painting

360
00:17:21,987 --> 00:17:24,287
by hiding it at some place.

361
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:27,787
An atelier probably has many shelves where the canvas can be put away.

362
00:17:27,787 --> 00:17:29,287
That can't be.

363
00:17:29,287 --> 00:17:30,987
Before I checked the painting,

364
00:17:30,987 --> 00:17:34,087
I closed all the doors of the canvas shelves and locked them.

365
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:38,287
If Thief Kid broke in, he would have less places to hide the painting.

366
00:17:38,287 --> 00:17:39,487
And where is that key?

367
00:17:39,487 --> 00:17:43,387
It is with the atelier keys that I lost during the blackout.

368
00:17:43,387 --> 00:17:45,487
It was found later in the corner of the corridor

369
00:17:45,487 --> 00:17:47,987
and is with the forensic officer now.

370
00:17:47,987 --> 00:17:53,087
Could someone take advantage of the blackout and snuck into the atelier?

371
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:54,387
It can't be.

372
00:17:54,387 --> 00:17:58,687
Just before the blackout, the Riot Task Force who was guarding the room

373
00:17:58,687 --> 00:18:01,487
have checked to see that the two doors were locked.

374
00:18:01,487 --> 00:18:03,887
But Thief Kid can open locks easily.

375
00:18:03,887 --> 00:18:07,287
The Riot Task Force members were by told Inspector Nakamori,

376
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:09,287
that in case the lights should go out,

377
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:11,887
grab the door knob and not let go.

378
00:18:11,887 --> 00:18:14,987
In other words, someone who was hiding in the attic

379
00:18:14,987 --> 00:18:17,287
came down to the atelier when the blackout occured.

380
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:20,187
He killed Mr. Kanbara who was in the room,

381
00:18:20,187 --> 00:18:22,187
took the painting and escaped.

382
00:18:22,187 --> 00:18:24,287
This seems to be immovable fact.

383
00:18:26,287 --> 00:18:29,687
But I wonder if it's really the Thief Kid?

384
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:32,187
It's hard to conclude just yet.

385
00:18:32,187 --> 00:18:35,487
After all, there are no cases in which he committed murder in the past.

386
00:18:35,487 --> 00:18:37,887
But something could've got into him this time.

387
00:18:37,887 --> 00:18:41,087
You sure have a cold attitude towards Thief Kid, don't you?

388
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:43,087
Of course!

389
00:18:43,087 --> 00:18:45,887
The Thief Kid is the enemy of the police!

390
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:50,387
Officer Sato, do you have any reason for wanting to back Thief Kid up?

391
00:18:50,387 --> 00:18:51,787
So what if I have my reasons?

392
00:18:51,787 --> 00:18:56,587
How could you tell whether it was Thief Kid or not by looking at the note?

393
00:18:56,587 --> 00:18:59,687
Because of the drawing on the warning note.

394
00:18:59,687 --> 00:19:03,087
He always draws a new one for each notice.

395
00:19:03,087 --> 00:19:07,487
If someone were to copy one of them from a newspaper or from TV,

396
00:19:07,487 --> 00:19:10,687
they would be caught instantly.

397
00:19:10,687 --> 00:19:13,487
However, according to the 2nd section that Inspector Nakamori belongs to,

398
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,387
the drawing this time didn't fall into either category

399
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,587
and was exactly like his drawings despite being drawn with new lines,

400
00:19:17,587 --> 00:19:19,187
and they deemed it to be genuine.

401
00:19:19,187 --> 00:19:24,187
Then somebody who's a good drawer could be copying Thief Kid.

402
00:19:24,187 --> 00:19:27,787
Like a comic drawer or an illustrator.

403
00:19:27,787 --> 00:19:29,687
Or even a painter.

404
00:19:29,687 --> 00:19:31,187
Hey, Conan!

405
00:19:31,187 --> 00:19:32,887
I was just stating examples.

406
00:19:32,887 --> 00:19:36,687
Well, I can't draw cartoon-like drawings like he does though.

407
00:19:36,687 --> 00:19:39,187
From the view point of a professional painter,

408
00:19:39,187 --> 00:19:42,187
I think that the drawing is genuine.

409
00:19:42,187 --> 00:19:43,787
I think so, too!

410
00:19:43,787 --> 00:19:45,187
Thief Kid is to blame.

411
00:19:45,187 --> 00:19:47,287
He's a villain after all!

412
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:50,987
Please share your wisdom with us to catch the villain then.

413
00:19:52,487 --> 00:19:53,987
My telephone's ringing.

414
00:19:55,687 --> 00:19:56,687
This one's ringing.

415
00:19:56,687 --> 00:19:59,187
You have two cell phones? Why is that?

416
00:19:59,187 --> 00:20:03,287
Yes, I have one for work and one for private use.

417
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:05,787
One of the phones seems to have blood on it.

418
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,087
Right after I carried father who was covered with blood,

419
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:12,387
I called my relatives to tell them of what happened using this cell phone.

420
00:20:12,387 --> 00:20:14,587
So I guess that's when the blood rubbed off.

421
00:20:14,587 --> 00:20:15,887
Yes, it's me.

422
00:20:15,887 --> 00:20:19,187
I'm sort of busy now, so can you call me later?

423
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:23,387
I'm sorry, but may I go change clothes?

424
00:20:23,387 --> 00:20:25,987
I'd like to get out of these clothes with my father's blood smeared on.

425
00:20:25,987 --> 00:20:29,187
Please go through a body check first then.

426
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:33,187
Inspector Nakamori already did a very thorough body check on me.

427
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,987
I've come to get the truth.

428
00:20:57,987 --> 00:20:59,687
Thief Kid?

429
00:21:10,087 --> 00:21:11,387
"Fragile equipment inside. Do not open."

430
00:21:11,387 --> 00:21:13,187
Hey, come here a second.

431
00:21:13,187 --> 00:21:15,787
Do you have any idea what's in this bag?

432
00:21:15,787 --> 00:21:17,387
Just leave it as is!

433
00:21:17,387 --> 00:21:19,487
You'll get yelled at if you touch it without permission.

434
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:20,587
Hey, sonny!

435
00:21:21,887 --> 00:21:23,387
May I have a word with you?

436
00:21:23,387 --> 00:21:24,487
What is it?

437
00:21:24,487 --> 00:21:26,887
I've been wondering from some time ago,

438
00:21:26,887 --> 00:21:28,387
but your back pocket...

439
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,387
Huh?

440
00:21:29,387 --> 00:21:31,887
There seems to be something inside.

441
00:21:31,887 --> 00:21:33,287
-That's... -What?

442
00:21:33,287 --> 00:21:35,887
Look, it's a card!

443
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:37,087
Thief Kid!

444
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,587
You've made a great discovery, sonny!

445
00:21:39,587 --> 00:21:41,587
I'm sure that Thief Kid put them inside

446
00:21:41,587 --> 00:21:43,487
some time before the incident occurred.

447
00:21:43,487 --> 00:21:45,987
Yeah. I've got to tell the Inspector right away!

448
00:21:45,987 --> 00:21:48,287
So it was Thief Kid after all!

449
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:51,987
Is that what you want me to say?

450
00:21:51,987 --> 00:21:53,187
Huh?

451
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,787
Just as I thought.

452
00:21:54,787 --> 00:21:58,687
He figured a child would be excited about anything that involved Thief Kid.

453
00:21:58,687 --> 00:22:01,287
So that's why he invited me here.

454
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:04,887
But if he got these cards ready,

455
00:22:04,887 --> 00:22:06,487
he would've left them behind at the scene of the murder.

456
00:22:06,487 --> 00:22:10,087
This means it's genuine and he only just found it.

457
00:22:11,187 --> 00:22:15,087
Inspector Nakamori who did the body check wouldn't have overlooked this.

458
00:22:15,087 --> 00:22:19,587
In other words, the one who put these cards in Mr. Oikawa's clothes

459
00:22:19,587 --> 00:22:22,387
must be someone who came here after the body check was done.

460
00:22:23,987 --> 00:22:28,787
I'll rip off your snobbish mask today for sure, Thief Kid!

461
00:22:28,787 --> 00:22:32,387
Under the golden light of this full moon.

462
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:48,487
Next Conan's Hint:

463
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,287
"Something that is there even if you think it's not"

464
00:24:51,287 --> 00:24:52,787
I wonder if Kid's really here?

465
00:24:52,787 --> 00:24:53,787
I know that at least one kid is here.

466
00:24:53,787 --> 00:24:55,987
And that kid is me.
