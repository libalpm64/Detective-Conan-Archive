1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,140
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,040
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,940
An unsolved case of a large house.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,140
A spicy deduction does the work.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,440
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,060
Ran, Pops and I are invited by Sonoko

9
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,360
and head for her villa in Karuizawa.

10
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,260
On our way, our things together with the car

11
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,960
sink into the river when the water level rises.

12
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,260
We end up spending the night at a house in the remote mountains

13
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,960
that we found by chance while walking.

14
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,860
However, that night,

15
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,360
in his room at the second floor,

16
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,660
the owner of that house, Mr. Iwao Akashi,

17
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,160
were found dead!

18
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,460
"The Suspicious Spicy Curry (Part 2)"

19
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,960
This is Yamamura from the Gunma Prefectural Police Station.

20
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,460
Excuse me. I'd like to ask you a question.

21
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,960
"Hiroto Akashi (32)" -Yes.

22
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,160
What can I do for you?

23
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,060
There are traces of something having been wrapped

24
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,360
around your father's wrists.

25
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,860
Do you have any idea what it could be?

26
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,260
Hey. Is that true?

27
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,160
Yes, sir! It looks as if he had been tied up by someone!

28
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,660
I think those are traces of rubber bands.

29
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,460
Father had a habit of bunching everything and anything up

30
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,760
with rubber bands,

31
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,060
and always had rubber bands around both his wrists.

32
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,960
Oh, just as I thought.

33
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,460
Just as you thought?

34
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,860
Yes.

35
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,960
We found a lot of rubber bands under his pillow,

36
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,960
so I thought maybe.

37
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,660
Is there anything else that you recall?

38
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,060
Like having seen someone suspicious around your house,

39
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,560
or having heard strange sounds or voices?

40
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,560
Come to think of it.

41
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,160
What do you mean "come to think of it"?

42
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,360
It's nothing.

43
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,060
But when I went in front of that room the first time,

44
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,360
I heard the man was crying.

45
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,760
What?

46
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,460
You heard him crying?

47
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,360
That was probably after deciding to commit suicide.

48
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,760
Didn't you see anything else in that room?

49
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,660
Conan!

50
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,960
You shouldn't be talking!

51
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,160
Yeah. There was a handkerchief on the floor.

52
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,160
I think he probably wiped his mouth

53
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,160
with it while eating curry,

54
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,260
because there was a little curry on it.

55
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,960
Don't tell me that...

56
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,660
If my deduction is correct.

57
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,060
Mr. Iwao didn't go to the dentist.

58
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,660
The reason why he was bleeding from his mouth

59
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,960
was probably because...

60
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,860
Hey, sonny, what's up?

61
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,160
Oh! Hey!

62
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,260
Don't touch!

63
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,260
This is...

64
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,860
Hey!

65
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,660
I see. So, it's just as I thought.

66
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,560
Geez.

67
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,060
If he had his tooth pulled out two or three days ago,

68
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,360
his gums should have healed a little and a little closed.

69
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,160
But his gums are still opened

70
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,960
with no signs of closing up.

71
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,960
Neither are there signs of blood have dried up or anything!

72
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,660
In other words, this is proof that he just got his tooth pulled out.

73
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,560
Moreover, the other teeth around it are also shaky.

74
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,860
This means that whatever he was clenching with all his might

75
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,860
between his teeth was pulled out with great force.

76
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,660
I get the picture of this trick!

77
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,860
But, why?

78
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,660
If this trick is what I think it is,

79
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,360
it should be somewhere in this room.

80
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,560
How come it's nowhere in sight.

81
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,060
Hey, what do we do?

82
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,160
This half-eaten curry over rice?

83
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,360
Oh, yeah. Well, there wasn't any poison in it

84
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,460
so shall we have them put it away?

85
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,960
Oh, that.

86
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,460
What is it?

87
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,660
Don't tell me you want to eat it?

88
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,160
Hey, stop it!

89
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,460
You gotta be kidding? Hey, kid?

90
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,460
Found it!

91
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,260
This is it!

92
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,460
No doubt about it.

93
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,360
Hey, isn't that a tooth?

94
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,660
What?

95
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,160
What're you talking about?

96
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,960
What? A human's tooth?

97
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,360
Looks like it.

98
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,260
No doubt about it.

99
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,460
The one who killed Mr. Iwao

100
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,860
created his own alibi through his trick,

101
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,360
and that person is Mr. Hiroto Akashi!

102
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,960
Okay then, now that I know.

103
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,460
I've got to get everyone to come here

104
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,360
and start the usual Sleeping Kogoro deduction show!

105
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,260
Excuse me.

106
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,760
What shall we do with this tooth?

107
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,060
-Excuse me. -I know, right?

108
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,260
-Please listen... -I guess we better report this to Officer Yamamura.

109
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,460
Right.

110
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,460
This is bad!

111
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,060
I lost my voice!

112
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,160
Darn it! What do I do now?

113
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,560
After I figured out the case and all.

114
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,160
I can't use the voice changer

115
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,360
to reveal the truth of the case to anyone in this situation.

116
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,860
I would write

117
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,660
but with this sprained wrist, I can't.

118
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,160
Only if they'd solve it themselves somehow.

119
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,160
My only hope is that the detectives will catch on.

120
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,560
So what I think is...

121
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,060
But, with the members here.

122
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,460
Hey, Conan!

123
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,760
Just where were you?

124
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,960
No way! You mean you lost your voice?

125
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,760
See. You were told not to talk

126
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,460
because you'd lose your voice, weren't you?

127
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,760
This case is plain to see!

128
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,760
Around 7:30 pm when Mr. Iwao Akashi passed away in his bedroom,

129
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,560
Ran, Conan, Sonoko and Mr. Hiroto, who were in this house,

130
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,960
were all in the living room so we all have an alibi.

131
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,160
I was taking a bath,

132
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,960
but have no motive

133
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,160
and had no way of getting the rope ready either.

134
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,060
Moreover an hour before we discovered the corpse,

135
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,160
the light of the bedroom was on,

136
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,760
but when we discovered the body, it was turned off.

137
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,560
No matter how you look at it this is suicide!

138
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,960
Mr. Iwao turned off the light of the room

139
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,560
and then committed suicide!

140
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,960
So, I'd advise you to stop investigating right now

141
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,460
and go on back to the station!

142
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,360
I guess so.

143
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,060
No, wrong.

144
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,960
This is homicide.

145
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,160
He used a trick to make it look like suicide

146
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,560
and killed the victim.

147
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,260
The killer is Mr. Iwao's adopted son,

148
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,560
Mr. Hiroto.

149
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,360
But, what can I do?

150
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,060
Without a voice,

151
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,360
how should I accuse him?

152
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,080
Okay, although this is going to be a bit bothersome.

153
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,880
What?

154
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,180
What?

155
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,580
Hey, Conan, just what're you doing?

156
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,980
Isn't he gesturing?

157
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,480
Rice crackers.

158
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,080
You want to eat 14 pieces of rice crackers?

159
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,380
No...

160
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,580
Crack. One. Four?

161
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,080
Close...

162
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,980
Okay, could it be...

163
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,280
crack code one?

164
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,480
Almost.

165
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,980
Oh, I got it!

166
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,880
Crack this code for once and for all. Right?

167
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,680
But, what is there to crack?

168
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,280
That curry?

169
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,580
Is something wrong with the curry?

170
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,380
It was spicy but good.

171
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,480
Right.

172
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,480
No...

173
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,080
That's not it? Then, what is it?

174
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,580
Me.

175
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,980
Sonoko.

176
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,980
Mr. Hiroto.

177
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,780
What? The old man upstairs?

178
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,080
A circle?

179
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,080
One?

180
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,680
What? I'm... three?

181
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,880
Are you talking about my age?

182
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,380
I'm a little over 33 already.

183
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,280
Ran was born when I was...

184
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,280
Are you talking about the amount of curry we all ate?

185
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,580
Mr. Hiroto, his father, Sonoko and I had one serving each,

186
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,380
but dad ate 3 servings!

187
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,080
Right...

188
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,580
So, what's wrong with that?

189
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,680
It sure is strange!

190
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,680
Because you and your group just happened

191
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,080
to come by this house tonight, right?

192
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,280
Moreover, Mr. Hiroto usually lives here only with his father.

193
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,380
There are just the two of you here, is that right?

194
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,080
Yes.

195
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,980
Then, curry enough for seven people is a bit too much

196
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,780
for just two people living together, don't you think?

197
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,080
It would surprise the Indians in India too!

198
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,080
Now that you mentioned it.

199
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,780
Don't tell me that you...

200
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,980
You must like curry?

201
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,680
I actually love curry too.

202
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,380
Well...

203
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,080
I made quite a lot because I usually invite the students

204
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,380
that I've become friends over.

205
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,980
They really seem to like the curry I make.

206
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,480
I would think so.

207
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,480
Too bad there was nobody at the tennis court today

208
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,680
because it rained.

209
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,980
Tooth.

210
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,980
Curry.

211
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,980
No good.

212
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,580
For the tooth. Curry. No good?

213
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,680
Bull's eye!

214
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,880
Oh, could it mean...

215
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,180
That after a tooth is pulled out,

216
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,580
eating something too spicy is not good?

217
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,080
Remember when you had your decayed tooth pulled out,

218
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,680
the dentist told you so, right?

219
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,980
Yeah.

220
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,880
But, then it's strange.

221
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,080
You knew that your father had his tooth pulled out

222
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,180
two or three days ago, didn't you, Mr. Hiroto?

223
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,580
Yes.

224
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:10,480
But, I had no idea that he had his tooth pulled out.

225
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,880
Officer Yamamura, could I speak to you for a moment.

226
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,280
Is that true?

227
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,780
Is something the matter?

228
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:28,580
Well, the coroner is here checking on the corpse

229
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,780
and he says that Mr. Iwao's tooth

230
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,480
seems to have been pulled out

231
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,380
just a while ago, not two or three days ago.

232
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,580
And the tooth that was pulled out

233
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,780
seems to have been found in the bedroom.

234
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,880
It seems to have been found in the half-eaten curry dish.

235
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,280
There must've been very tough meat in the curry,

236
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,680
because the teeth near the tooth that had come off

237
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
all seemed to be shaky too.

238
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,480
I don't think such tough meat was in it.

239
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,880
He.

240
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,380
Bit.

241
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,080
Something.

242
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,980
You mean that old man?

243
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,980
I'm sure he was.

244
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,880
He was eating curry, you know.

245
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,080
You want me to sit?

246
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,280
Bring the tied part of the necktie around behind

247
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,880
then bring the end of the necktie to the front

248
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,480
and bite?

249
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,280
I got it!

250
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,880
That old man

251
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,880
was suspended in air while biting on the rope!

252
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,880
Bingo!

253
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,780
If so, he would eventually get tired

254
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,980
and stop biting on the rope,

255
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,180
then he'd be strangled!

256
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,380
His tooth probably flew into the curry dish at that time

257
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,480
because of the impact!

258
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,280
Since his mouth is blocked with the rope,

259
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,380
he probably couldn't yell out either!

260
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,980
You mean that voice that I heard back then was

261
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,180
not him crying, but him groaning.

262
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,980
But there were no traces of the rope by his mouth.

263
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,080
That's probably because...

264
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,680
The handkerchief!

265
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,780
Remember, the handkerchief with the curry on it

266
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,980
was near the corpse, wasn't it?

267
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,580
He was made to bite the handkerchief together with the rope!

268
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,980
If so,

269
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,580
then traces of the rope wouldn't be left around his mouth.

270
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:20,280
But, his hands weren't tied when he was found.

271
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,180
If he grabs the rope with both hands,

272
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,280
he can free his mouth so he could've shouted,

273
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,080
"Somebody help!"

274
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,480
Besides,

275
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,780
the bedroom light that was on an hour and a half ago,

276
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,980
was turned off when the corpse was found, wasn't it?

277
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,080
All during that time,

278
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,780
nobody went to that room,

279
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,080
so how could the light have been turned off?

280
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,480
Hey.

281
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,080
Conan?

282
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,080
Hey! Don't play around with it!

283
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,380
I see.

284
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,080
Both his wrists were tied with the electric cable in a bow tie

285
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,780
and the edge of the cable

286
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,680
was connected to the electric cable!

287
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,780
Then when he becomes exhausted

288
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,080
the rope will pull away from his mouth,

289
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,980
his body will slide down choking his neck, and at the same time

290
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,980
the electric cable will be pulled and the light will go out.

291
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,980
The cable that is tied to his wrists will untie

292
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:26,380
and the body will be in the exact position as we found it!

293
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,280
Which means that the narrow lines that were found

294
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,480
on Mr. Iwao Akashi's wrists

295
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,980
were marks that were left from his wrists being tied!

296
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,780
But these light fixtures have three levels

297
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,280
and unless you pull the cable three times like Conan just did

298
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,080
it won't get dark, right?

299
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,180
Pulling just once would only turn off the light on the outer part,

300
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:50,780
and pulling the cable twice will leave the miniature light on.

301
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,880
If the brightness is adjusted to the second level

302
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,380
and the miniature light is loosened,

303
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,480
then pulling on the cable just once will turn the lights off!

304
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,980
I see.

305
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,280
But, is it possible to untie it?

306
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,880
See, this part that is tied to make the cable longer.

307
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,180
In order to tie the hands of someone who is struggling,

308
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,680
it would be impossible to do so

309
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,180
while the electric cable is connected to the light fixture!

310
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,980
Then, this knot would have to be untied once.

311
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,680
But, this looks to be a complicated knot.

312
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,480
This is called the fishing knot!

313
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,080
What's that?

314
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,480
The way a fishing line is tied!

315
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,880
A slippery line has to be tied like this or it'll get untied!

316
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,380
I see! That's why Mr. Hiroto's wife

317
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,380
went to buy this book on fishing!

318
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,280
She wanted to learn how to tie the electric cable firmly in place.

319
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,480
But, why was the cable in the bedroom is different then?

320
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,280
The cable in the bedroom was tied into a regular knot!

321
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,780
I see.

322
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,780
That's why the electric cable in the bedroom was shorter.

323
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,380
He was unable to untie the knot,

324
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,580
so he had to cut it using scissors.

325
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,680
And the cable was tied into a regular knot

326
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,380
because the killer didn't know

327
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,380
how to tie it fishing line style!

328
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,480
Isn't that right...

329
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,480
Mr. Hiroto Akashi?

330
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,280
The trick you used goes like this.

331
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,780
You took the curry to Mr. Iwao's bedroom upstairs.

332
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,280
While he was eating the curry, you probably covered his mouth

333
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,780
with the handkerchief from behind,

334
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,780
and tied him up with the electric cable that you've cut.

335
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,280
After putting the loop of the rope around his neck,

336
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,980
you made him bite the rope with the handkerchief,

337
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,780
and left him suspended.

338
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,480
Of course, you threatened him saying

339
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,580
that if he lets go of the rope from his mouth,

340
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,380
he would choke to death!

341
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,580
Finally you tied both of his hands with the electric cable

342
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,180
and make somebody go to the bedroom

343
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,480
to pick up his curry dish.

344
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,980
You warn that person saying,

345
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,280
"If the light is on, he's still eating"

346
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,180
"so don't go into the room."

347
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,180
You first ask the person to go get the plate around 10 minutes

348
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,780
after you came down because he most likely

349
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,380
still holding the rope in his mouth.

350
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,180
Then you ask that person to go again after a while.

351
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,480
The person will go in and find the dead body after the light is off.

352
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,480
Since you were with us right through in the living room,

353
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,780
you most definitely have an alibi!

354
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,380
Then, are you saying that Mr. Hiroto was at the tennis court in the rain

355
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,980
just to invite someone to witness his alibi?

356
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,080
Yeah.

357
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,980
He deliberately made curry for a lot of people.

358
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,880
No way.

359
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,380
Which means if we didn't come here,

360
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,080
this wouldn't have happened.

361
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,180
No.

362
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,480
Even if you all didn't come here today,

363
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,280
I was going to kill him tonight.

364
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,880
It's true that today is the anniversary of my wife's death.

365
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,280
My wife was found lying on the ground

366
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,080
in this forest drenched in rain.

367
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,080
Lying on the ground?

368
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,080
Yes.

369
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,080
It was when I went out to work at a court in Tokyo on a rainy day.

370
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,280
My father suddenly woke my wife, who was asleep with a cold,

371
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,380
and made her go shopping.

372
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,980
He told her that he wanted to eat mushroom rice.

373
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,480
She should've refused, but she didn't.

374
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,080
She walked with unsteady steps over to a supermarket about 3km away

375
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,080
and on the way back, just as expected, fell to the ground and...

376
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,280
But that's no reason for you to kill him.

377
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,880
No. I decided to kill him

378
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,480
the day after my wife's funeral.

379
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,880
Unaware that I was behind him,

380
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,680
father was mumbling the following words towards the altar of my mother.

381
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,980
Dear. She finally broke down.

382
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,880
Next time I wish he'd get himself a healthier wife.

383
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,180
A toy that is more durable like Hiroto.

384
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,680
It can't be...

385
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,480
You mentioned that you were adopted.

386
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,280
Yes, until I heard him say that, I believed him.

387
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,780
I believed him being selfish

388
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,680
was because he already considered me as his son

389
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,680
Yes. We, My father, wife and I, built a house in the forest

390
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,480
and began living here because of my father's selfishness

391
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,880
saying that he wanted to live apart

392
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,780
from the rest of the world.

393
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,280
Of course the same goes for the electric cable.

394
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,080
He suddenly lengthened the electric cable of his room

395
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,180
and ordered all the electric cable in the other rooms to be the same way.

396
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:47,280
What? So, the electric cable in that room...

397
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,380
Yes.

398
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,480
Father tied the cable in his room himself.

399
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,680
Talk about not knowing how to tie knots.

400
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,780
If that was a knot that my wife had tied,

401
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,180
I...

402
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,880
I couldn't have cut it

403
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,080
and maybe would've had second thoughts

404
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,880
about carrying out this murder.

405
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,280
It sure was an uncomfortable case.

406
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,680
Well, after all, a person passed away so...

407
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,580
The combination of Sleeping Kogoro

408
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,780
and deduction queen Sonoko,

409
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:56,080
sure can close a case in a jiffy!

410
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,280
I forgot to videotape the deduction show,

411
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,080
because you started it without going to sleep!

412
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,480
It's not my problem!

413
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,780
I got twice as tired this time.

414
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,280
What's the matter, Ran?

415
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,580
It seems that I received a call last night,

416
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,480
but the number has no caller I.D.

417
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,780
If you're talking about the call that came in

418
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,080
when you were using the restroom,

419
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,680
he took it.

420
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,680
What?

421
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,980
It was a wrong number call.

422
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,280
Shinichi?

423
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,780
Wasn't that call from Shinichi?

424
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,480
That look on your face, it must've been!

425
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,880
What?

426
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,680
What did he say?

427
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,280
Geez.

428
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,380
I'm sorry to have worried you.

429
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,580
No more X-sized cups for bras?

430
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,580
X-sized cups means the difference in size

431
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,380
with the under-bust is about 70cm.

432
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,480
Were your breasts that big?

433
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,880
Of course not!

434
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,580
I'm not a cow, you know.

435
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,280
I guess I'll mail her later.

436
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,680
Next Conan's Hint:

437
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,920
"Shinichi's Mother and Ran's Mother"

438
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,480
The hint of the next episode somehow makes me nervous.

439
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,200
Dad, what is the legend that surrounds them?

440
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,640
Goodbye.
