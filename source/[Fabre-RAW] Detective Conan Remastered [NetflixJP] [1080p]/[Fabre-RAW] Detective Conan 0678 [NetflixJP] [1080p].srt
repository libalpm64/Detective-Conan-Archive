1
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:09,139
Murderer!

2
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,439
My God!

3
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:19,439
This is bad, Mr. Glover!

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,439
I have one too.

5
00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:24,839
The magistrate office will take this

6
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:27,539
as an opportunity to capture you.

7
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:30,009
If this should happen,

8
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:32,011
business as well as the Satsuma-Choshu Alliance will go down the drain.

9
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:34,013
No need to worry.

10
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:37,239
All charges against, I, myself, will clear.

11
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:40,019
I, Ryoma Sakamoto!

12
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,023
The vivid colored memories of summer

13
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:46,025
solve mysteries all season round.

14
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:48,339
The stage is in Nagasaki, at the end of the Edo Era.

15
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,339
Where did the scriptwriter disappear to?

16
00:00:50,339 --> 00:00:52,031
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:54,033
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:56,339
His name is Detective Conan!

19
00:02:37,735 --> 00:02:41,735
"The Nagasaki Mystery (End of the Edo Era)".

20
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:53,535
We've time-slipped,

21
00:02:53,535 --> 00:02:55,735
or so I thought, but...

22
00:02:55,735 --> 00:02:56,835
As always,

23
00:02:56,835 --> 00:03:00,535
Ran won first prize at the shopping arcade raffle drawing.

24
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:02,161
And, today,

25
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:05,135
"Nagasaki Station" -we arrived in Nagasaki.

26
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:07,835
"Confucius Shrine"

27
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:11,635
"Ooura Catholic Church"

28
00:03:11,635 --> 00:03:15,235
"Glover Garden" -Glover Garden is a famous site in Nagasaki

29
00:03:15,235 --> 00:03:18,435
where the mansion of the English merchant, Thomas Blake Glover,

30
00:03:18,435 --> 00:03:21,135
who supported zealous men of noble ideals,

31
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:23,335
such as Ryoma Sakamoto stands.

32
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:28,535
What's she looking for?

33
00:03:28,535 --> 00:03:32,191
-A heart stone. -A heart stone?

34
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:34,193
Among the stone pavement within the garden,

35
00:03:34,193 --> 00:03:37,335
it is said that there are two heart-shaped stones.

36
00:03:37,335 --> 00:03:40,199
If a couple finds them, it is said that they will get married,

37
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:42,201
or if they touch it, their love will be realized.

38
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:44,535
There seems to be many myths about it.

39
00:03:45,335 --> 00:03:47,135
I found it!

40
00:03:47,135 --> 00:03:49,035
It's cute!

41
00:03:49,035 --> 00:03:51,035
I wonder where the other one is.

42
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:53,735
Who cares about something like that?

43
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:56,935
I'm more concerned about eating the famous Nagasaki Chanpon and Saraudon.

44
00:03:56,935 --> 00:03:59,035
Murderer!

45
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:02,221
What was that?

46
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:04,223
I'm sure I heard murderer.

47
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:05,135
This way?

48
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:09,635
Move it!

49
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:11,635
Everybody, stay where you are and don't move!

50
00:04:11,635 --> 00:04:15,435
Leave the rest to this famed Detective Kogoro Mouri!

51
00:04:17,035 --> 00:04:19,135
What's with this victim?

52
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,241
He... he's revived.

53
00:04:25,135 --> 00:04:26,835
Who on earth are all of you?

54
00:04:26,835 --> 00:04:28,247
Cut!

55
00:04:34,835 --> 00:04:37,035
Too late.

56
00:04:37,035 --> 00:04:38,935
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:38,935 --> 00:04:40,935
It's so misleading.

58
00:04:40,935 --> 00:04:43,135
The filming of a two-hour TV mystery drama

59
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:49,235
staged in Nagasaki at the end of the Edo era was in session.

60
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:52,271
A murder occurs at the Glover Mansion,

61
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:54,273
and Ryoma Sakamoto who was sheltered here,

62
00:04:54,435 --> 00:04:56,275
serves the role of a detective.

63
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:59,335
He takes Ine, a young woman doctor who studied Western medicine

64
00:04:59,335 --> 00:05:01,935
by means of the Dutch language, as his assistant,

65
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:05,635
and clears his name by solving the case.

66
00:05:05,635 --> 00:05:07,535
How about it, Ine?

67
00:05:07,535 --> 00:05:10,035
Was a gun used, after all?

68
00:05:10,035 --> 00:05:13,435
"Kyonosuke Sasahara (33) as Ryoma Sakamoto"

69
00:05:13,435 --> 00:05:16,835
To think that something like this would happen at this mansion...

70
00:05:16,835 --> 00:05:19,835
"Benichiyo Yamashita (42) as Tsuru"

71
00:05:19,835 --> 00:05:22,301
We've sure got trouble.

72
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:25,635
"Andrew Hatta (50) as Glover"

73
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:27,935
No doubt about it.

74
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,309
The cause of death is by gunshot.

75
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:33,735
"Futaba Nanao (23) as Ine Karasuma"

76
00:05:33,735 --> 00:05:35,135
Cut!

77
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,935
Okay!

78
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:39,835
Hey! Are you sure it's okay?

79
00:05:39,835 --> 00:05:41,035
It may be just acting,

80
00:05:41,035 --> 00:05:43,435
but should a doctor say her lines with so much emotion?

81
00:05:43,435 --> 00:05:45,035
"Keisuke Sakakibara (45), TV Drama Director" -It's okay!

82
00:05:45,035 --> 00:05:48,327
Ine's still a new doctor, so that'll do.

83
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:51,635
"Akikazu Nakane (48), Cameraman" -Your acting was quite something, Ochiyo!

84
00:05:51,635 --> 00:05:55,235
"Ryuhei Kishimura (30), Assistant Director" -Right, Benichiyo!

85
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:56,335
You think so?

86
00:05:56,535 --> 00:05:58,035
I'm glad if you think so.

87
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,335
Next is the scene that Chubei Soneya,

88
00:06:03,335 --> 00:06:06,035
a colleague of the victim appears.

89
00:06:06,035 --> 00:06:08,135
Showtime, Mr. Sazanami!

90
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:09,235
Okay!

91
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:12,035
I'm counting on you, Bara!

92
00:06:12,035 --> 00:06:15,335
"Chojiro Sazanami (45) as Chyubei Soneya"

93
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:18,357
Yeah, same here, Cho.

94
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:19,735
Where's Soneya's props?

95
00:06:19,735 --> 00:06:21,035
Here they are!

96
00:06:21,035 --> 00:06:23,735
"Kazuomi Sakota (35), Props Master" -They're all here.

97
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,135
Don't you think it's a bit too flashy?

98
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:31,735
No.

99
00:06:31,735 --> 00:06:34,035
I wonder if you can do something about this comb too.

100
00:06:34,035 --> 00:06:37,535
No, but that's Madame Butterfly's...

101
00:06:37,535 --> 00:06:40,735
You really like opera, don't you?

102
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:43,435
But is it really okay, Bara?

103
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:45,635
To start filming when we still don't know how the story ends,

104
00:06:45,635 --> 00:06:47,335
or more than that, who the culprit is.

105
00:06:48,735 --> 00:06:50,135
Well, even if it's a bit delayed,

106
00:06:50,135 --> 00:06:54,135
Tatsumi always comes up with a masterpiece.

107
00:06:55,735 --> 00:06:57,735
She's quite a beauty,

108
00:06:57,735 --> 00:06:59,435
that woman playing the role of the doctor.

109
00:06:59,435 --> 00:07:01,435
You mean Ms. Futaba Nanao, right?

110
00:07:01,435 --> 00:07:04,935
She's a new actress that's expected to become popular soon.

111
00:07:04,935 --> 00:07:06,835
You've got to be kidding!

112
00:07:06,835 --> 00:07:08,735
We can't do that!

113
00:07:10,935 --> 00:07:12,435
That's why I told you that won't do.

114
00:07:12,435 --> 00:07:14,435
I told you to keep it hidden!

115
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:17,435
Mr. Sasahara is a handsome bachelors

116
00:07:17,435 --> 00:07:18,735
and is always ranking at the top when it comes to

117
00:07:18,735 --> 00:07:21,635
wanting him to be a boyfriend. That's what I heard from Sonoko.

118
00:07:21,635 --> 00:07:23,535
I wonder if something's wrong.

119
00:07:24,935 --> 00:07:27,235
Maybe it has to do with women?

120
00:07:27,235 --> 00:07:28,427
No way!

121
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:31,035
We've got trouble!

122
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:33,935
"Taizo Ooki (52), Producer of a drama production company" -Tatsumi split!

123
00:07:33,935 --> 00:07:34,935
-What? -What?

124
00:07:40,735 --> 00:07:44,135
I knew he's been troubled recently, but...

125
00:07:44,135 --> 00:07:48,135
After all of us who used to work together gathered together again...

126
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,535
Maybe we should wait a while more.

127
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,935
No, we can't wait any longer.

128
00:07:52,935 --> 00:07:54,935
Is it?

129
00:07:54,935 --> 00:07:56,455
If so...

130
00:07:56,455 --> 00:07:57,835
That's right!

131
00:07:57,835 --> 00:07:59,035
The thing is...

132
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:01,835
What?

133
00:08:02,935 --> 00:08:05,035
Sleeping Kogoro?

134
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:06,035
Yes?

135
00:08:07,035 --> 00:08:08,467
Please!

136
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:10,735
Please find the culprit of this mystery drama

137
00:08:10,735 --> 00:08:14,473
with your deduction, Sleeping Kogoro!

138
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:16,475
Huh?

139
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:18,035
Hey, hey.

140
00:08:18,035 --> 00:08:20,479
"Kosaku Tatsumi (45), Scriptwriter" -The scriptwriter of the mystery drama,

141
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,235
Mr. Kosaku Tatsumi,

142
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:26,035
is a veteran who has a history of winning various awards.

143
00:08:26,035 --> 00:08:27,635
On top of this drama being the work of Mr. Tatsumi

144
00:08:27,635 --> 00:08:30,135
with no other original work to go on,

145
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,335
since it cranked in despite delay in the script being submitted,

146
00:08:33,335 --> 00:08:34,935
there was no one but Mr. Tatsumi,

147
00:08:34,935 --> 00:08:36,495
who knew what to expect was coming,

148
00:08:36,735 --> 00:08:40,035
or who the culprit in the script would be.

149
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:44,503
If this drama goes down the drain,

150
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:47,035
our company will go bankrupt!

151
00:08:47,035 --> 00:08:50,035
So long as you figure out who the culprit is, Mr. Mouri,

152
00:08:50,035 --> 00:08:53,235
I'll take care of what comes up after that.

153
00:08:53,235 --> 00:08:54,935
-Please! -Please!

154
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,935
It's impossible after all.

155
00:09:02,935 --> 00:09:05,935
With no written script,

156
00:09:05,935 --> 00:09:09,235
there's no way that I can figure out the culprit.

157
00:09:09,235 --> 00:09:12,235
But, you accepted the work, didn't you?

158
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:13,335
You told them that there's no mystery

159
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:15,735
that the Sleeping Kogoro can't solve.

160
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:17,435
Well, you see...

161
00:09:17,435 --> 00:09:20,235
It's true that there're not enough clues.

162
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:24,935
Huh?

163
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:28,547

00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:34,553
What's this?

168
00:09:34,553 --> 00:09:36,235
Why is it in a place like this?

169
00:09:36,235 --> 00:09:38,557
A band of artwork thieves.

170
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:39,635
That's it!

171
00:09:39,635 --> 00:09:42,561
These are stories based on real cases, aren't they?

172
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:45,435
In other words, the culprit is a band of thieves?

173
00:09:45,435 --> 00:09:47,335
But, nothing like that comes out

174
00:09:47,335 --> 00:09:49,835
in the script that they have now, you know?

175
00:09:49,835 --> 00:09:51,935
They're appearing from now.

176
00:09:51,935 --> 00:09:53,735
I wonder about that.

177
00:09:53,735 --> 00:09:55,035
If so,

178
00:09:55,035 --> 00:09:57,935
it wouldn't have to be hidden in a place like this.

179
00:09:58,935 --> 00:10:02,035
Yes, right, I'm leaving now.

180
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,135
So,

181
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,135
I've got no choice but to do something about it, right?

182
00:10:08,935 --> 00:10:10,589
Why this?

183
00:10:12,835 --> 00:10:14,593
I'm exhausted.

184
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:18,135
So, there weren't many clues after all, were there?

185
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:19,635
That's why I've been telling you

186
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:22,135
the band of thieves are the culprits.

187
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:24,235
Hi, Mr. Mouri.

188
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:30,635
I'm Andrew Hatta, acting as Glover.

189
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:32,035
-What? -What?

190
00:10:33,735 --> 00:10:37,035
I look more like the statue in Glover Garden

191
00:10:37,035 --> 00:10:39,135
without my make-up, don't I?

192
00:10:39,135 --> 00:10:41,535
No...

193
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,635
If I remember correctly, the Glover who helped Ryoma out

194
00:10:44,635 --> 00:10:46,625
was about 30 years old.

195
00:10:46,835 --> 00:10:49,635
Detective boy.

196
00:10:49,635 --> 00:10:51,035
You're thinking that the actor

197
00:10:51,035 --> 00:10:54,633
is older than the actual Glover, aren't you?

198
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:56,235
No...

199
00:10:57,235 --> 00:10:59,735
It seems that Mr. Ooki's production company

200
00:10:59,735 --> 00:11:02,641
is having quite a tough time.

201
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:05,435
So, most of the performers in this drama

202
00:11:05,435 --> 00:11:07,735
are acting for guarantees cheaper than the usual,

203
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:11,435
thanks to connections through Mr. Ooki and Mr. Sakakibara.

204
00:11:11,435 --> 00:11:14,235
Does that go for you too, Mr. Hatta?

205
00:11:14,235 --> 00:11:17,335
Yes, I've known everyone for a long time.

206
00:11:17,335 --> 00:11:18,657
The director did mention

207
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:21,735
that all the colleagues from the past got together.

208
00:11:23,235 --> 00:11:24,435
Yes.

209
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:29,335
Mr. Sakakibara, Mr. Ooki, Ochiyo, Mr. Sazanami and I

210
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:32,235
used to work together since the days we were still unknown actors.

211
00:11:32,235 --> 00:11:34,673
Of course, the same goes for Mr. Tatsumi.

212
00:11:34,835 --> 00:11:37,135
I see.

213
00:11:37,135 --> 00:11:40,935
Since I was the only one who could be used to act as Glover,

214
00:11:40,935 --> 00:11:43,435
the script was written so I was already married to Tsuru,

215
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:47,435
as a middle-aged couple.

216
00:11:47,435 --> 00:11:50,689
Mr. Tatsumi may have not liked this,

217
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:53,335
because he used to place importance on being genuine.

218
00:11:53,335 --> 00:11:57,535
Is that why he disappeared without finishing the script?

219
00:11:57,535 --> 00:11:59,635
I have no idea.

223
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:15,135
I wonder.

224
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,715
How about you, Bara?

225
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:17,835
Me neither.

226
00:12:17,835 --> 00:12:21,835
Tatsumi used to be secretive about what he was planning to write, so...

227
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:27,335
Hey, what on earth are we going to do?

228
00:12:27,335 --> 00:12:29,335
It's just a matter of time, you know.

229
00:12:43,535 --> 00:12:44,743
Hey, Sonny.

230
00:12:46,535 --> 00:12:48,735
You're the one who came with Mr. Mouri, aren't you?

Since they finished filming my part,

234
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:11,318
I was thinking that maybe I would be able to help you,

235
00:13:11,318 --> 00:13:13,718
or rather, take you around.

236
00:13:13,718 --> 00:13:15,818
That'd be a great help!

we visited the places that were noted.

You mean this?

I bought it at a shop near the Glover Garden.

Yup.

The thing is, a few days ago,

Mr. Tatsumi was almost hit by a car.

271
00:15:02,518 --> 00:15:04,618
What?

272
00:15:04,618 --> 00:15:07,718
He said that somebody seems to have pushed him from behind.

Are you sure?

274

Why didn't you say anything till now?

Well...

276
00:15:14,918 --> 00:15:16,518
Anyway,

277
00:15:16,518 --> 00:15:20,899
maybe Mr. Tatsumi disappeared because he feared for his life.

Hello?

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,961
Mr. Ooki.

289
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:27,518
What? You got the continuation of the script by mail from Mr. Tatsumi?

290
00:16:27,518 --> 00:16:30,969
And, was the name of the culprit written?

00:16:56,318 --> 00:16:57,818
I guess.

00:16:57,818 --> 00:16:59,618
Strange.

She sure is something.

301

Does she do karate or something?

302
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:11,018
She may not look it, but she's won the Kanto Tournament,

"Capitan room" - The continuation of the script that was received by mail

305
00:17:24,818 --> 00:17:26,518
was also incomplete.

306
00:17:26,518 --> 00:17:31,018
But the second murder case was written there.

307
00:17:31,018 --> 00:17:33,318
The site of the crime was in the Capitan room of Dejima.

308
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:37,035
The victim is a secret detective hired by the Nagasaki magistrate,

309
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:38,418
and he left a dying message behind; the Japanese kanji character

310
00:17:38,418 --> 00:17:41,039
for the number 9 (kyu).

311
00:17:42,318 --> 00:17:45,518
And? What did he say?

312
00:17:45,518 --> 00:17:51,049
Ask the daughter of the shipping agency Miuraya, Otei, for the details.

313
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:53,518
Cut! Okay!

314
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:57,918
We managed to fill the schedule in time,

315
00:17:57,918 --> 00:17:59,818
but the problem is, "What now?"

316
00:17:59,818 --> 00:18:01,418
Which means?

317
00:18:01,418 --> 00:18:05,418
A new character appeared without previous reference.

318
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,518
There are a lot of mysterious dialogs too.

319
00:18:07,518 --> 00:18:10,418
I'm sure it's a quite important role, though.

320
00:18:10,418 --> 00:18:12,318
We don't have anyone to act the role.

321
00:18:12,318 --> 00:18:15,073
We don't have the time or money to call someone from Tokyo either.

322
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:17,518
That's a problem, isn't it?

323
00:18:17,518 --> 00:18:19,077
Right, it sure is.

324
00:18:19,318 --> 00:18:22,318
How old are you?

325
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:24,218
I'm 17.

326
00:18:24,218 --> 00:18:27,085
I see! We can do that too!

327
00:18:29,518 --> 00:18:31,089
It can't be.

328
00:18:31,918 --> 00:18:34,018
Please lend this to us!

329
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:36,018
No! No way!

330
00:18:36,018 --> 00:18:38,018
I mean... Hey...

331
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:40,118

00:18:43,418 --> 00:18:45,103
Give it your best shot!

334
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:46,318
Hang in there!

335
00:18:46,318 --> 00:18:48,518
No, the other way!

336
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:50,618
That's why I don't like amateurs.

337
00:18:50,618 --> 00:18:51,918
I'm sorry.

338
00:18:51,918 --> 00:18:53,718
No, it's my mistake!

339
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:55,918
Hey, are you sure it's going to work?

340
00:18:55,918 --> 00:18:58,718
It's not a school play, you know.

341
00:18:58,718 --> 00:19:00,918
Don't worry, just relax.

342
00:19:00,918 --> 00:19:02,818
Just say your lines

343
00:19:02,818 --> 00:19:05,518
and we'll do the rest.

344
00:19:05,518 --> 00:19:06,918
Yes...

345
00:19:06,918 --> 00:19:09,518
Okay then, shall we try out the dialogs?

346
00:19:09,518 --> 00:19:12,718
You can try first by looking at the scripts.

347
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,618
Please wait!

348
00:19:14,618 --> 00:19:16,418
Let's start!

349
00:19:16,418 --> 00:19:20,518
Mr. Sakamoto. I'm Otei, the daughter of Miuraya.

350
00:19:20,518 --> 00:19:23,141
What would you like with me?

351
00:19:25,518 --> 00:19:28,018
That's what the girls of the West wear,

352
00:19:28,018 --> 00:19:30,118
called a dress, is it not?

353
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:32,418
The daughter of Miuraya is known to all in town

354
00:19:32,418 --> 00:19:34,518
to be affected by European culture.

355
00:19:34,518 --> 00:19:35,618
By the way,

356
00:19:35,618 --> 00:19:38,318
the man that was "you know what" in the Capitan's room

357
00:19:38,318 --> 00:19:40,618
was said to have left a writing "kyu" behind.

358
00:19:40,618 --> 00:19:42,918
Do you know what it means?

359
00:19:42,918 --> 00:19:45,163
Kyu?

360
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:47,165
Figures are important.

361
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:49,718
Figures will solve everything.

362
00:19:49,718 --> 00:19:52,118
Right?

363
00:19:52,118 --> 00:19:54,618
Yes, that's right.

364
00:19:54,618 --> 00:19:56,618
Why me too?

365
00:19:56,618 --> 00:19:59,177
Cut! Okay!

366
00:20:01,718 --> 00:20:03,718
Break time!

367
00:20:04,718 --> 00:20:06,818
But, what a strange dialog.

368
00:20:06,818 --> 00:20:09,618
"Figures will solve everything." What a line.

369
00:20:09,618 --> 00:20:10,718
Come to think of it,

370
00:20:10,718 --> 00:20:12,518
there seems to be a lot of actors and actress

371
00:20:12,518 --> 00:20:15,193
with numbers in their names.

372
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:19,197
"8" -Andrew Hatta, acting as Glover, right?

373
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:20,318
Tsuru, his wife

374
00:20:20,318 --> 00:20:23,201
"1,000" -is acted by Ms. Benichiyo Yamashita.

375
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:24,718
I guess so.

376
00:20:24,718 --> 00:20:27,818
"7" -The same with Futaba, her last name is Nanao.

377
00:20:27,818 --> 00:20:29,518
There are some on our staff too.

378
00:20:30,918 --> 00:20:33,918
"3" -Mr. Ooki's name is Taizo.

379
00:20:33,918 --> 00:20:36,218
"1" -Mr. Sakota's is Kazuomi.

380
00:20:40,518 --> 00:20:43,221
Mr. Sakamoto, do you know?

381
00:20:43,418 --> 00:20:46,718
That in Nakashima River here, there lives a monster.

382
00:20:46,718 --> 00:20:48,118
What?

383
00:20:48,118 --> 00:20:50,618
But, there's no need to worry.

384
00:20:50,618 --> 00:20:52,018
The monster's weak point

385
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:55,518
is its second tooth from the left on its lower jaw.

386
00:20:55,518 --> 00:20:58,018
Cut! Okay!

387
00:20:58,018 --> 00:21:00,218
The monster's weak point...

388
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,518
This is another mysterious line.

389
00:21:03,718 --> 00:21:05,618
This is...

390
00:21:05,618 --> 00:21:07,618
Only this line is written in a different font.

391
00:21:07,618 --> 00:21:09,018
Maybe...

392
00:21:16,018 --> 00:21:20,518
Maybe this could be a message from Mr. Tatsumi?

393
00:21:20,518 --> 00:21:22,018
If Otei of Miuraya

394
00:21:22,018 --> 00:21:26,118
was a character that was created to relay that message...

395
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,267
The thing thinkable is the truth of why he disappeared!

396
00:21:29,518 --> 00:21:30,918
And, that is...

397
00:21:30,918 --> 00:21:31,918
"Serial Art Theft Case"

398
00:21:31,918 --> 00:21:32,918
"Illegally Sold Among Fans"

399
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:33,918
"A Large-scale Smuggling Organisation"

400
00:21:39,618 --> 00:21:43,281
This is all I know.

401
00:21:43,518 --> 00:21:47,285
Next, I will take you to the restaurant that first started Western cuisine.

402
00:21:48,818 --> 00:21:51,289
I've had enough! Count me out!

403
00:22:02,018 --> 00:22:04,718
He was probably punched,

404
00:22:04,718 --> 00:22:05,918
moreover, with bare hands.

405
00:22:05,918 --> 00:22:07,818
Get a hold of yourself, Sakota!

406
00:22:07,818 --> 00:22:09,307
Where's the ambulance?

407
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:11,618
I called them. They'll be here soon.

408
00:22:11,618 --> 00:22:13,618
Darn! Who did this to you?

409
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:24,218
Huh? Me?

410
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:25,318
What?

411
00:22:25,318 --> 00:22:27,325
Ran?

412
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:28,518
Can't be!

413
00:22:28,518 --> 00:22:31,329
The karate champion?

414
00:22:31,329 --> 00:22:33,818
No, I didn't...

415
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,335
Hey, Sakota! Get a hold of yourself!

416
00:22:37,518 --> 00:22:38,918
Sakota!

417
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,156
Next Conan's Hint:

418
00:24:04,156 --> 00:24:06,060
"Stroke order".

419
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,206
Dad, what shall I do?

420
00:24:08,206 --> 00:24:09,427
Sleeping Ran?

421
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:10,780
I promise I'll help you.
