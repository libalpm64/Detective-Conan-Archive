1
00:00:02,842 --> 00:00:04,842
Two people were killed 20 years ago

2
00:00:04,842 --> 00:00:06,842
and one was killed 15 years ago

3
00:00:06,842 --> 00:00:09,042
in a serial killing incident.

4
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:11,991
The culprit also ran over Police Detective Morimura

5
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:15,042
who stopped him for questioning and killed him.

6
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:17,042
The culprit wounded the then,

7
00:00:17,042 --> 00:00:18,742
assistant inspector Matsumoto in the left eye.

8
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:21,342
The valid date for the incident that happened

9
00:00:21,342 --> 00:00:23,442
20 years ago had already expired,

10
00:00:23,442 --> 00:00:25,342
And, there are only three more days to go

11
00:00:25,342 --> 00:00:28,542
before the incident that happened 15 years will also expire.

12
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:31,142
There are two clues leading to the culprit.

13
00:00:31,142 --> 00:00:33,142
One is the straight-lined scar

14
00:00:33,142 --> 00:00:34,442
that Superintendent Matsumoto had left

15
00:00:34,442 --> 00:00:36,742
on the back of the culprit.

16
00:00:36,742 --> 00:00:38,942
The other is the whistling.

17
00:00:38,942 --> 00:00:43,442
He kept whistling a song that was popular 20 years ago.

18
00:00:44,442 --> 00:00:47,442
While Officer Takagi and the others were doing their best investigating,

19
00:00:47,442 --> 00:00:50,342
criminal psychologist, Mr. Douji Hiramune

20
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:52,442
continued to make provoking statements

21
00:00:52,442 --> 00:00:55,542
to the culprit on air and in magazines.

22
00:00:55,542 --> 00:00:57,142
And...

23
00:00:57,142 --> 00:01:00,942
I passed a weird guy at the entrance.

24
00:01:00,942 --> 00:01:03,442
He was wearing an off-season long coat

25
00:01:03,442 --> 00:01:05,342
and whistling a tune.

26
00:01:06,642 --> 00:01:11,242
Did the serial killer really come?

27
00:01:13,342 --> 00:01:15,442
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

28
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,742
Saturday nights are for mystery.

29
00:01:17,742 --> 00:01:19,742
You're not your usual self, Officer Takagi.

30
00:01:19,742 --> 00:01:21,842
Heading straight to arrest the culprit?

31
00:01:21,842 --> 00:01:23,442
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:23,442 --> 00:01:25,342
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:25,342 --> 00:01:27,342
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

34
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:13,935
"A New Scar and the Whistling Man"

35
00:03:15,335 --> 00:03:16,835
Really, Conan?

36
00:03:16,835 --> 00:03:18,435
Is it true that there is a possibility

37
00:03:18,435 --> 00:03:21,335
that the serial killer came to that condo?

38
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:23,535
I heard that the criminal psychologist

39
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:25,735
named Mr. Hiramune who was on TV a while ago

40
00:03:25,735 --> 00:03:28,535
"Hiramune" -lives in this condo.

41
00:03:28,535 --> 00:03:31,935
I'm going over to that person's place!

42
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:33,335
Wait, Conan!

43
00:03:33,335 --> 00:03:34,835
Conan!

44
00:03:34,835 --> 00:03:36,635
Officer Chiba, will you go get the car.

45
00:03:36,635 --> 00:03:37,635
Yes.

46
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:40,199
"Hiramune"

47
00:03:43,535 --> 00:03:44,935
There's no answer.

48
00:03:51,935 --> 00:03:53,035
It's open.

49
00:03:58,235 --> 00:03:59,735
Mr. Hiramune.

50
00:03:59,735 --> 00:04:00,935
Are you there?

51
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:05,135
Mr. Hiramune.

52
00:04:07,335 --> 00:04:08,735
Mr. Hiramune.

53
00:04:11,635 --> 00:04:14,735
No good.

54
00:04:14,735 --> 00:04:19,135
There's blood on his Polo shirt?

55
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:20,535
"Z"?

56
00:04:22,235 --> 00:04:25,035
The man who was murdered is criminal psychologist,

57
00:04:25,035 --> 00:04:27,735
Mr. Douji Hiramune, age 41.

58
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:31,035
The murder weapon is the fruit knife

59
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:34,253
that was in the kitchen here.

60
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:36,255
There's a trace of a stun gun

61
00:04:36,255 --> 00:04:38,035
having been stuck out at the back of his neck.

62
00:04:38,035 --> 00:04:39,635
Judging from the alphabet that is carved on his back,

63
00:04:39,635 --> 00:04:41,735
this is likely the doings

64
00:04:41,735 --> 00:04:43,635
of the same serial killer of all the other cases.

65
00:04:44,835 --> 00:04:47,735
But the letter this time is "Z".

66
00:04:47,735 --> 00:04:51,135
I also thought that the next letter would be "N".

67
00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:53,035
According to the investigation reports

68
00:04:53,035 --> 00:04:58,535
the letters in the order of E, S, and W

69
00:04:58,535 --> 00:05:00,279
were carved on the bodies of the victims.

70
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,435
Therefore, if the next letter is "N",

71
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:04,283
it would complete the four cardinal directions.

72
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:06,935
But, if the letters symbolize the four cardinal directions,

73
00:05:06,935 --> 00:05:10,289
it would be east, west, south, north.

74
00:05:10,535 --> 00:05:14,293
So the order of the letters should be E, W, S, N.

75
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:17,935
Well, it's for certain that this is not the doings of a copycat.

76
00:05:17,935 --> 00:05:20,935
It hasn't been publicized that letters

77
00:05:20,935 --> 00:05:22,835
are carved on the bodies of the victims and besides,

78
00:05:22,835 --> 00:05:24,303
Conan's friend seems to have mentioned

79
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:28,307
passing a man at the entrance who was whistling.

80
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:31,435
But, no matter if he knew about the case,

81
00:05:31,435 --> 00:05:34,735
to think that after hearing from his friend

82
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,315
about a man who was whistling

83
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:38,635
it's amazing that you would sense that Mr. Hiramune

84
00:05:38,635 --> 00:05:40,319
who had been bad-mouthing the killer would be in danger,

85
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,035
and run in here first thing.

86
00:05:43,035 --> 00:05:47,335
You're running around like a full fledged detective as always, Conan.

87
00:05:48,635 --> 00:05:52,735
Did he bad-mouth the killer that badly?

88
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:53,835
Yes, sir.

89
00:05:53,835 --> 00:05:55,935
He would say things like the killer is trembling

90
00:05:55,935 --> 00:05:58,335
waiting for his term to expire.

91
00:05:58,335 --> 00:06:01,435
Or, if he's got the guts, to come out and appear before him.

92
00:06:01,435 --> 00:06:03,135
It's as if he's provoking the killer.

93
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:04,335
Yes, sir.

94
00:06:04,335 --> 00:06:07,135
Mr. Hiramatsu also repeatedly bashed the killer

95
00:06:07,135 --> 00:06:09,535
likewise in the papers and weekly magazines too.

96
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:13,335
It seems that Mr. Hiramune rushed home

97
00:06:13,335 --> 00:06:15,335
after finishing his live appearance at a TV station.

98
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:18,935
He seems to have waiting for an acquaintance to come to his place.

99
00:06:18,935 --> 00:06:20,835
I guess we could deem that acquaintance

100
00:06:20,835 --> 00:06:21,935
of his to be a suspect.

101
00:06:21,935 --> 00:06:25,735
He could be someone connected with copy machines or something.

102
00:06:26,735 --> 00:06:30,835
See, under Mr. Hiramune's left hand.

103
00:06:30,835 --> 00:06:35,235
There's blood on the Ctrl key and C key.

104
00:06:35,235 --> 00:06:36,935
If you press these two key,

105
00:06:36,935 --> 00:06:38,377
you can copy something right?

106
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:41,235
That's true.

107
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:44,383
Maybe the killer left it there deliberately.

108
00:06:44,635 --> 00:06:49,035
But, there's no blood on his left hand, right?

109
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:50,135
True.

110
00:06:50,135 --> 00:06:53,235
Blood for some reason is only on his right hand

111
00:06:53,235 --> 00:06:54,393
where he's holding the mouse.

112
00:06:54,635 --> 00:06:58,035
Which means that blood was put on the key with his right hand,

113
00:06:58,035 --> 00:07:01,235
which after he went out of his way to cover it with his left hand, right?

114
00:07:01,235 --> 00:07:03,735
If the killer left it deliberately,

115
00:07:03,735 --> 00:07:05,635
do you think he would do something like this?

116
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:07,035
Right.

117
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:09,935
I think he would leave something that is more conspicuous behind.

118
00:07:09,935 --> 00:07:12,411
He didn't put the blood on with his left hand

119
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:14,935
to make it look like it wasn't a coincidence.

120
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,935
He hid it with his left hand

121
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:20,135
because he didn't want to show it to the killer.

122
00:07:20,135 --> 00:07:22,835
In other words, Mr. Hiramune,

123
00:07:22,835 --> 00:07:27,635
at the moment of his death left a dying message.

124
00:07:28,835 --> 00:07:31,735
There is a copy machine in this room but...

125
00:07:31,735 --> 00:07:33,335
I checked a while ago,

126
00:07:33,335 --> 00:07:35,535
but nothing looked strange.

127
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:38,235
Could it be a coy band or something?

128
00:07:38,235 --> 00:07:40,439
The tune the suspect was whistling was a song

129
00:07:40,635 --> 00:07:43,335
that was popular 20 years ago, right?

130
00:07:43,335 --> 00:07:46,035
It could be a band that is covering that tune.

131
00:07:46,035 --> 00:07:49,135
There are a million bands that would doing something like that.

132
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,235
Superintendent Matsumoto.

133
00:07:50,235 --> 00:07:51,235
-Sir. -Sir.

134
00:07:51,235 --> 00:07:54,453
It was the song of the times back then.

135
00:07:54,453 --> 00:08:00,459
Well, it seems to hold a deep meaning for the killer though.

136
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:01,935
Deep meaning?

137
00:08:01,935 --> 00:08:04,463
Do you know that 20 years ago

138
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:07,435
Morimura went to question the person

139
00:08:07,435 --> 00:08:09,335
in a suspicious car that he frequently saw

140
00:08:09,335 --> 00:08:13,335
and died on duty when he was run over by that car?

141
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:17,335
It seems that the man was whistling that tune

142
00:08:17,335 --> 00:08:20,479
even as Morimura approached the car.

143
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,035
And the man was in tears.

144
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:24,483
Tears?

145
00:08:24,735 --> 00:08:25,935
Okay.

146
00:08:25,935 --> 00:08:28,487
Sato and Chiba, go question people in this vicinity.

147
00:08:28,735 --> 00:08:29,735
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

148
00:08:29,735 --> 00:08:31,935
Shiratori, keep the copy machine in mind

149
00:08:31,935 --> 00:08:34,835
and go check around Mr. HIramune once more.

150
00:08:34,835 --> 00:08:36,235
That's just what I plan to do.

151
00:08:36,235 --> 00:08:38,135
Takagi, just to be safe,

152
00:08:38,135 --> 00:08:39,535
go meet the bereaved families of the victims

153
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:40,499
of the past three cases,

154
00:08:40,735 --> 00:08:43,435
and check to see if they had any kind of connection

155
00:08:43,435 --> 00:08:44,503
with Mr. Hiramune.

156
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:46,505
Yes, sir! Roger!

157
00:08:49,735 --> 00:08:51,135
So enthusiastic.

158
00:08:53,435 --> 00:08:56,235
Maybe it worked a bit too effectively.

159
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:01,835
The murder case that had only three days to go before expiration.

160
00:09:01,835 --> 00:09:03,935
Now with a new murder committed by the same killer,

161
00:09:03,935 --> 00:09:06,535
has 15 more years to go before expiration.

162
00:09:06,535 --> 00:09:07,635
Oh no.

163
00:09:07,635 --> 00:09:10,235
The Criminal Procedure Act was revised

164
00:09:10,235 --> 00:09:14,533
and the new expiration date for murders cases is 25 years.

165
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:16,535
If we can only nab this killer

166
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:19,435
within the 25 years we from now.

167
00:09:21,935 --> 00:09:24,535
I get to go with Ms. Sato, just the two of us...

168
00:09:24,535 --> 00:09:26,235
to the hot spring!

169
00:09:27,535 --> 00:09:28,547
I see.

170
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,235
That's why he's more out to get than always.

171
00:09:33,235 --> 00:09:34,835
His motive's impure.

172
00:09:34,835 --> 00:09:36,555
A hot spring, how nice.

173
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:40,559
Take us with you too.

174
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,035
Why are you guys in this car?

175
00:09:44,035 --> 00:09:47,535
You let us on yourself!

176
00:09:47,535 --> 00:09:50,135
In the parking lot, we asked you, "Where are you going?"

177
00:09:50,135 --> 00:09:52,335
and you opened the door without saying anything.

178
00:09:52,335 --> 00:09:55,135
You didn't look like you were all there, though.

179
00:09:57,435 --> 00:09:59,335
Well... my head was filled with thoughts about the hot spring.

180
00:09:59,335 --> 00:10:02,581
No, I mean the case so...

181
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:04,935
And what do you intend to do?

182
00:10:04,935 --> 00:10:07,435
Are you going to take us with you?

183
00:10:07,435 --> 00:10:09,035
Or, are you going to let us down?

184
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:11,835
Of course I'm going to let you all down.

185
00:10:11,835 --> 00:10:15,935
But Ayumi and Ai passed by the killer, you know.

186
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:20,599
But, I'm headed for the houses of the bereaved families of the victims

187
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:22,601
of the cases 20 and 15 years ago.

188
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:27,535
But, I heard them say on TV that the bereaved families

189
00:10:27,535 --> 00:10:29,035
are also being suspected as suspects.

190
00:10:29,035 --> 00:10:31,235
True, but...

191
00:10:31,235 --> 00:10:34,235
Well, if you intend to wait 25 years

192
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:36,615
for Officer Sato who'll turn 50

193
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:40,035
and become a super over the hill mature woman,

194
00:10:40,035 --> 00:10:41,735
you can try handling everything alone.

195
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:44,335
-Super over the hill mature. -Super over the hill mature.

196
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:46,135
She's just great now though.

197
00:10:46,135 --> 00:10:47,835
She's beautiful too!

198
00:10:47,835 --> 00:10:49,835
She sure is a buy, I'd say.

199
00:10:54,135 --> 00:10:57,535
Listen, the only one who gets out of the car is Conan.

200
00:10:57,535 --> 00:11:01,135
The rest of you stay put in the car, all right?

201
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:02,435
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir...

202
00:11:05,235 --> 00:11:08,035
The person we're about to meet now

203
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:11,135
is the wife of Mr. Tsuguharu Bokawa, a doctor,

204
00:11:11,135 --> 00:11:14,653
the first victim who was killed 20 years ago, right?

205
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:18,657
"Bokawa General Hospital" -Yes. Mr. Bokawa was the head of a hospital,

206
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:22,661
and his wife Maiko inherited a great amount of estate,

207
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:26,435
so she was taken up as a suspect.

208
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,935
But, no concrete evidence

209
00:11:28,935 --> 00:11:30,335
was found nor did she have anything connecting her

210
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:33,935
with Mr. Mugita, the second victim who was killed.

211
00:11:36,935 --> 00:11:40,679
Yes. I know this person.

212
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,335
He's Mr. Hiramune, the criminal psychologist

213
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:45,935
"Maiko Bokawa (62)" -that appears on TV frequently, isn't he?

214
00:11:45,935 --> 00:11:48,135
What about him?

215
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:52,135
He was found killed in his condo just a while ago.

216
00:11:52,135 --> 00:11:57,235
Most probably by the same killer who killed your husband 20 years ago.

217
00:11:57,235 --> 00:11:59,135
My, how frightening.

218
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,035
So, I'm wondering if your husband

219
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:05,935
was in any way connected to Mr. Hiramune.

220
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:09,335
I wonder how old is Mr. Hiramune?

221
00:12:09,335 --> 00:12:11,235
41 years old.

222
00:12:11,235 --> 00:12:14,235
Then, 20 years ago he was 21 years old

223
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:17,335
and my husband died when he was 50.

224
00:12:17,335 --> 00:12:21,435
It's hard for me to believe that they were connected in any way.

225
00:12:21,435 --> 00:12:23,035
I see.

226
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:26,135
Did he ever meet anyone in secret?

227
00:12:27,135 --> 00:12:29,535
Who is he, this boy?

228
00:12:29,535 --> 00:12:33,635
I'm watching the officer on duty for social studies.

229
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:36,235
Oh, is that so.

230
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:39,335
But, it's true that he used to frequently drink

231
00:12:39,335 --> 00:12:42,235
with someone on Saturday nights.

232
00:12:42,235 --> 00:12:44,735
Do you have any idea who it was?

233
00:12:44,735 --> 00:12:46,135
No.

234
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:50,035
Only, there was a time when he came home totally wasted back then.

235
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:55,135
"Darn! How dare he call me cry baby, cry baby and make fun of me!"

236
00:12:55,135 --> 00:12:58,435
He kept complaining.

237
00:12:58,435 --> 00:13:00,535
It could've been an old friend of his

238
00:13:00,535 --> 00:13:02,761
that knew him since he was child.

239
00:13:02,935 --> 00:13:07,335
I told the police about this 20 years ago too.

240
00:13:07,335 --> 00:13:08,767
"For pedestrians and bicycles only"

241
00:13:09,935 --> 00:13:11,535
The next one we're visiting

242
00:13:11,535 --> 00:13:15,735
is the house of a victim that was killed 20 years ago too.

243
00:13:15,735 --> 00:13:17,535
He is the younger brother of the Assistant Professor

244
00:13:17,535 --> 00:13:18,777
of the science and technology department,

245
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:20,235
Mr. Atsunori Mugita, who was killed 2 days after Mr. Bokawa,

246
00:13:20,235 --> 00:13:22,781
He was suspected because his older brother

247
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:24,783
was covered by a huge insurance policy.

248
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:26,435
But, no connection was found between him

249
00:13:26,435 --> 00:13:29,835
and the victim of the first case.

250
00:13:29,835 --> 00:13:32,435
What about with the lawyer in the third case?

251
00:13:32,435 --> 00:13:35,235
Of course, it seems they found no connection.

252
00:13:40,035 --> 00:13:44,135
Criminal psychologist, Mr. Doji Hiramune.

253
00:13:44,135 --> 00:13:45,335
So he makes...

254
00:13:45,335 --> 00:13:48,035
"Hidekuni Mugita (56)" -a lot of appearances on TV shows,

255
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,809
but I don't like watching TV, you see.

256
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:54,135
And, Mr. Hiramune was killed.

257
00:13:54,135 --> 00:13:57,635
By the same killer that killed your brother Atsunori.

258
00:13:58,817 --> 00:13:59,935
Aren't you shocked?

259
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:02,235
Well, sort of.

260
00:14:02,235 --> 00:14:07,335
But, I've made up my mind to forget about that case 5 years ago

261
00:14:07,335 --> 00:14:09,435
when it expired.

262
00:14:09,435 --> 00:14:14,833
Then, do you know if your brother and Mr. Hiramune knew each other?

263
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:17,835
I wonder but I don't think so.

264
00:14:20,535 --> 00:14:22,135
Saturday night.

265
00:14:23,135 --> 00:14:27,435
Did you brother meet with anyone on Saturday nights?

266
00:14:27,435 --> 00:14:30,849
Yes. The wife of my late brother

267
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:33,335
who died the year before last used to say

268
00:14:33,335 --> 00:14:37,435
that he didn't come home on Saturday nights,

269
00:14:37,435 --> 00:14:39,135
but rather, frequently came back the next morning.

270
00:14:39,135 --> 00:14:41,835
Thinking that he may be having an extra-marital affair,

271
00:14:41,835 --> 00:14:44,335
his wife persistently rang his pocket bell.

272
00:14:44,335 --> 00:14:49,235
It seems that he called her back but was outraged

273
00:14:49,235 --> 00:14:53,235
telling her that he was at the doctor so not to bug him.

274
00:14:53,235 --> 00:14:55,435
Doctor? Could it have been Dr. Bokawa

275
00:14:55,435 --> 00:14:58,435
who was the first person that was killed?

276
00:14:58,435 --> 00:15:01,935
Yes. A police detective said the same thing 20 years ago

277
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:04,535
and seemed to be investigating the case.

278
00:15:04,535 --> 00:15:09,235
My brother's name wasn't on the patient list of that doctor, was it?

279
00:15:09,235 --> 00:15:11,535
I guess not.

280
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:20,899
How was it, Officer Takagi?

281
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,901
Did you find anything?

282
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:24,135
Nothing at all.

283
00:15:25,335 --> 00:15:26,905
Ayumi and Ai, what do you think?

284
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:29,635
Didn't the man just now look a lot like the killer?

285
00:15:29,635 --> 00:15:32,935
I didn't think he resembled the killer in particular.

286
00:15:32,935 --> 00:15:36,035
I don't think lady is the killer either.

287
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,917
Well, I guess if he were wearing a long haired wig and mustache

288
00:15:39,135 --> 00:15:42,035
like the time we passed him,

289
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:44,135
he would probably make a different impression, though.

290
00:15:44,135 --> 00:15:45,535
True.

291
00:15:45,535 --> 00:15:47,935
Where next?

292
00:15:47,935 --> 00:15:49,635
The last place we're going

293
00:15:49,635 --> 00:15:52,335
to go is to the house of Eiki Nabei,

294
00:15:52,335 --> 00:15:54,535
the son of the lawyer, Mr. Susumu Nabei,

295
00:15:54,535 --> 00:15:56,635
who was killed five years after the serial killings

296
00:15:56,635 --> 00:15:58,235
that occurred 20 years ago.

297
00:16:07,738 --> 00:16:10,738
Eiki who was 10 years old back then,

298
00:16:10,738 --> 00:16:12,538
was in his room when he was awakened

299
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,953
by the sound of his father groaning.

300
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:16,738
And, after the killer left,

301
00:16:16,738 --> 00:16:20,138
he says that he was so terrified that he couldn't come of his room

302
00:16:20,138 --> 00:16:22,638
until his mother came back from shopping.

303
00:16:22,638 --> 00:16:25,638
His mother, after finding her husband lying dead

304
00:16:25,638 --> 00:16:27,438
became bed-ridden because of the shock,

305
00:16:27,438 --> 00:16:28,967
and still seems to be in the hospital even now.

306
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:33,738
So, Eiki seems to be living alone in that house now.

307
00:16:33,738 --> 00:16:36,338
Will you please give me a break, officer!

308
00:16:36,338 --> 00:16:39,538
I've talked more than enough about the incident in the past!

309
00:16:39,538 --> 00:16:42,138
"Eiki Nabei (25)" -I'm sick and tired of the media coming after me

310
00:16:42,138 --> 00:16:45,438
saying that the case is about to expire and all!

311
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:46,985
I could care less if the killer

312
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:50,638
who killed my father is going after a new target!

313
00:16:50,638 --> 00:16:52,991
Then, then...

314
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:57,538
At least please tell me if your father knew Mr. Hiramune...

315
00:16:57,538 --> 00:16:59,538
Who knows? Stupid!

316
00:16:59,538 --> 00:17:00,999
Stupid?

317
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:09,538
It seems he wasn't like that before.

318
00:17:09,538 --> 00:17:10,638
Really?

319
00:17:10,638 --> 00:17:11,638
Yes.

320
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:13,011
According to the police,

321
00:17:13,238 --> 00:17:15,038
be it about what happened on the day of the incident

322
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:17,438
or the strange thing that his father was saying

323
00:17:17,438 --> 00:17:19,017
before he was killed.

324
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:21,019
He used to come to the police

325
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,021
and report every little thing he remembered.

326
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:25,738
Strange thing?

327
00:17:25,738 --> 00:17:28,438
It seems he used to sleep till noon on Sundays,

328
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:31,438
and mumble when he got up.

329
00:17:31,438 --> 00:17:33,031
"I had a tough time last night because the dealer (head of the house)

330
00:17:33,238 --> 00:17:36,038
went out with a big hand!(was run over)"

331
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:39,037
So, somebody's parent was run over by a car.

332
00:17:39,238 --> 00:17:42,538
I see, after all, he was a lawyer.

333
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:44,038
He must've been handling the case of either

334
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:46,338
the plaintiff or the defendant.

335
00:17:46,338 --> 00:17:49,838
So? How does that end up being a strange story?

336
00:17:49,838 --> 00:17:53,938
Well, Mr. Nabei who was killed specialized in business law

337
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:57,055
and didn't handle cases having to do with traffic accidents.

338
00:17:58,238 --> 00:17:59,638
Then, why?

339
00:17:59,638 --> 00:18:01,438
That's why Eiki thought it strange

340
00:18:01,438 --> 00:18:04,338
and reported it to the police.

341
00:18:06,338 --> 00:18:08,438
A cry baby.

342
00:18:08,438 --> 00:18:10,838
At the doctor.

343
00:18:10,838 --> 00:18:13,071
The dealer goes out.

344
00:18:14,338 --> 00:18:15,638
So, I see.

345
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,238
I've finally figured out

346
00:18:20,238 --> 00:18:22,738
the connection of the four victims.

347
00:18:22,738 --> 00:18:23,738
What?

348
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:28,538
Mahjong?

349
00:18:28,538 --> 00:18:32,738
Are you saying that the thing in common all the four people

350
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:34,738
who were killed had is mahjong?

351
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:39,097
Mr. Hiramune said on the wide show on TV, didn't he?

352
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:41,099
That "it's all last",

353
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:44,238
or he was getting rid of "anko" to finish that round of the game.

354
00:18:44,238 --> 00:18:47,538
These are all terminology used in mahjong, aren't they?

355
00:18:47,538 --> 00:18:51,109
I'm sure that Mr. Hiramune loves mahjong.

356
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:55,113
I... I guess so, but what about the other three?

357
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:58,538
As to Mr. Bokawa, who was the first one killed,

358
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:01,119
when he came home drunk on Saturday night complaining,

359
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,638
"How dare they make fun of me calling me cry baby."

360
00:19:05,638 --> 00:19:08,338
Assistant professor, Mugita of the science and technology department,

361
00:19:08,338 --> 00:19:11,638
after being called on his beeper by his wife,

362
00:19:11,638 --> 00:19:13,131
retuned her call shouting,

363
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:17,135
"I'm almost ready to win the game. Don't bug me!"

364
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:19,137
Lawyer Nabei seems to have slept frequently till noon on Sundays,

365
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:21,638
and when he got up would mumble,

366
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:27,438
"The dealer won the game with a big hand, right?"

367
00:19:27,438 --> 00:19:29,838
When Mr. Bokawa said they called him a cry baby,

368
00:19:29,838 --> 00:19:31,738
it meant that he'd frequently pick up the tiles of other people

369
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:34,638
-and display part of his hand in the game. -Why does he have to cry?

370
00:19:34,638 --> 00:19:36,838
It's a game called Mahjong, isn't it?

371
00:19:36,838 --> 00:19:39,438
To cry, "naku" is when a person,

372
00:19:39,438 --> 00:19:42,638
in order to win the game as soon as possible,

373
00:19:42,638 --> 00:19:45,163
picks a tile that someone disposes of on the table up

374
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:46,638
to make a pair of threes or fours.

375
00:19:46,638 --> 00:19:48,838
Which means that phrase that Mr. Nabei mentioned about,

376
00:19:48,838 --> 00:19:51,169
"I was in a fix because the parent was run over" was...

377
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:55,173
Maybe that phrase, "The parent was run over" was taken mistakenly

378
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:58,038
by his the son, Eiki?

379
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:00,438
"Parent" means the dealer of the mahjong game

380
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:02,638
who gets to score a lot of points.

381
00:20:02,638 --> 00:20:03,738
"Run over" means the points of the person

382
00:20:03,738 --> 00:20:05,638
who wins the game gets higher.

383
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,538
It means that a hand called "Haneman" is played and the player wins.

384
00:20:07,538 --> 00:20:10,638
So, he meant, the dealer won with a high point,

385
00:20:10,638 --> 00:20:13,191
which put him a fix.

386
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:15,193
Then what does Mr. Mugita's remark,

387
00:20:15,438 --> 00:20:19,197
"I'm at the doctor now" mean?

388
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:20,738
He probably said,

389
00:20:20,738 --> 00:20:22,338
"I'll be winning the game with just two more tiles now!

390
00:20:22,338 --> 00:20:25,838
Don't bother me!"

391
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:28,138
True.

392
00:20:28,138 --> 00:20:30,938
It sounds like "I'm at the doctor now" to me, though.

393
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:34,138
What does that means?

394
00:20:34,138 --> 00:20:38,438
When you need only two more tiles to go win the game,

395
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:41,538
you call it "Iishanten"!

396
00:20:41,538 --> 00:20:43,221
In other words, he's angry and saying,

397
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:44,338
"I'm almost ready to win the game,

398
00:20:44,338 --> 00:20:47,225
so don't call me on the beeper and bother me"

399
00:20:47,438 --> 00:20:50,938
Well, all the terminologies used are for mahjong,

400
00:20:50,938 --> 00:20:53,638
so if a person who never played mahjong heard wrong,

401
00:20:53,638 --> 00:20:55,233
it's understandable.

402
00:20:55,438 --> 00:20:57,038
True.

403
00:20:57,038 --> 00:20:59,237
Because the ones who heard so, were Mrs. Bohkawa,

404
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:06,238
Mrs. Mugita and Mr. Nabei's son, Eiki who was still a child.

405
00:21:06,238 --> 00:21:07,245
If you think of it that way,

406
00:21:07,438 --> 00:21:09,638
the remark the culprit spit out,

407
00:21:09,638 --> 00:21:11,038
that Eiki heard was about mahjong too, then.

408
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:12,438
Remark he spit out?

409
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:18,038
It seems that Eiki heard the words of the culprit who left the house.

410
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:19,738
You're just paying me to take responsibility,

411
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:21,638
so don't blame it on me.

412
00:21:21,638 --> 00:21:25,638
You're to blame for doing something like that.

413
00:21:25,638 --> 00:21:31,269
I was cornered by the police who left this big scar on me.

414
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:33,271
Taking responsibility (sekininbarai) and cornered (tenpai)

415
00:21:33,438 --> 00:21:35,538
are also words used in mahjong.

416
00:21:35,538 --> 00:21:38,838
And? What from there?

417
00:21:38,838 --> 00:21:40,538
What else?

418
00:21:40,538 --> 00:21:42,338
There's a very high possibility

419
00:21:42,338 --> 00:21:43,638
that the four were sitting around

420
00:21:43,638 --> 00:21:46,138
a mahjong table somewhere every Saturday.

421
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,285
Narrow the mahjong parlours down

422
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:50,138
to ones that the four could've dropped by from their houses

423
00:21:50,138 --> 00:21:54,138
or work place 20 years ago and ask around.

424
00:21:54,138 --> 00:21:56,738
As far as mahjong is concerned,

425
00:21:56,738 --> 00:21:58,338
people can play together

426
00:21:58,338 --> 00:22:01,038
no matter what the difference in age is.

427
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:04,138
Okay!

428
00:22:04,138 --> 00:22:09,307
Youth Detective Squad! Let's go!

429
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:12,538
It's getting late, you know. Is it okay?

430
00:22:12,538 --> 00:22:14,538
It's already 9 pm.

431
00:22:14,538 --> 00:22:15,838
Yeah, don't worry about it.

432
00:22:15,838 --> 00:22:19,317
I told mother that I'd be spending the night at doctor's house tonight.

433
00:22:19,317 --> 00:22:21,319
No problem.

434
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,738
Really?

435
00:22:24,638 --> 00:22:26,738
Okay! Let's get going!

436
00:22:26,738 --> 00:22:28,038
Aye!

437
00:22:33,538 --> 00:22:35,938
Hold on, whistling man.

438
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:39,338
I'll expose you're true identity for sure.

439
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,272
Next Conan's Hint:

440
00:24:04,272 --> 00:24:05,420
"Mouse".

441
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,428
Why do they call it a mouse?

442
00:24:07,428 --> 00:24:09,427
You'll find out next episode.

443
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:10,540
Genta, your mouth looks funny.
