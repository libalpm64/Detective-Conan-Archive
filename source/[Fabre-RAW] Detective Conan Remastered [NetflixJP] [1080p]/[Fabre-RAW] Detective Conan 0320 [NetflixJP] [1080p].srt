1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,040
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,140
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,940
The answerphone that bring about mystery after mystery.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,940
A feeling of something not being right is wiped out all together!

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,940
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,260
Pops! Pops!

9
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,060
Shut up. Let me sleep in peace, will you?

10
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,160
Pops!

11
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,560
Come on, today's Sunday, isn't it?

12
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,160
You've got a guest!

13
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,860
Good morning.

14
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,660
Huh?

15
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,260
Officer Chiba?

16
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,360
What's this?

17
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,260
What do you want this early on a Sunday morning?

18
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,460
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,560
Well... so like I was saying, Inspector Megure...

20
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,560
Conan? Why are you here?

21
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:40,160
"Ninja Technique of Alibi Scheme"

22
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,960
The cause is death by suffocation.

23
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,260
The estimated time of death is between 7pm to 9pm last night.

24
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,460
There are no signs of any struggle here,

25
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,560
so the victim must've been killed somewhere else

26
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,960
then brought here to North Beika Park and abandoned.

27
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,360
Is something bothering you?

28
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,660
Well, I'm not sure why I was summoned here.

29
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,260
What're you talking about?

30
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,860
Isn't he an acquaintance of yours?

31
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,660
We found this in the victim's pocket. See!

32
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,260
My name card. Why is it here?

33
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,660
Likewise, from the driver's license the victim had on him,

34
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,360
the victim is Yuichi Kusaka, 26 years old,

35
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,560
a resident of Kofu City, Yamanashi Prefecture.

36
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,560
Well? Mr. Mouri?

37
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,860
But...

38
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,260
I remember him!

39
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,760
What? Conan?

40
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,560
Sticking your nose into the case again.

41
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,660
Well, well, now, Mr. Mouri.

42
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,260
Conan? Tell us.

43
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,760
He's the one that came together

44
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,760
with novelist Mr. Ryutaro Tsukigata before.

45
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,360
Tsukigata?

46
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,860
Tsukigata.

47
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,660
Right, he's one of the two disciples that was there back then!

48
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,460
He's the famous samurai novelist

49
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,260
that is good at writing about Ninja stuff?

50
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,360
Yes, 6 months ago, he came to visit me

51
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,160
saying he wanted to challenge writing detective stories too,

52
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,860
and suddenly came to interview me.

53
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:16,560
So, at that time you also gave Mr. Kusaka your name card?

54
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,160
He was indeed a salaried worker

55
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,860
who was training to become a professional novelist,

56
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,760
and because he was just about to come to Tokyo,

57
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,660
he said he brought him along to experience interviewing.

58
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,760
What about the other one?

59
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,260
What? What do you mean?

60
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,260
Mr. Saruhashi!

61
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,760
Oh, Saruhashi.

62
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,260
His name is Masaru Saruhashi,

63
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,660
and he was saying that he lived in Beika-cho just like Mr. Tsukigata,

64
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,660
so he went through training

65
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,160
by always helping to clear up the manuscripts.

66
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,260
Okay. First, we'll go see Mr. Tsukigata!

67
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,760
Yes, sir!

68
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,060
Let's go, Mr. Mouri!

69
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,460
Oh, yes, sir!

70
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,660
What? You mean Mr. Kusaka?

71
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,860
So, I think he was on his way here.

72
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,160
I see.

73
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,960
He was supposed to come here yesterday

74
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,260
with the new story he had finished writing.

75
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,060
Did Mr. Kusaka have that manuscript?

76
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,560
No, he didn't have anything on him.

77
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,260
I got a call from Teito Station last night a little after 8pm,

78
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,960
saying that he would come by at 9pm.

79
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,160
Since he didn't come, I was a bit concerned.

80
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,360
Oh, you got a call from Teito Station at about 8pm?

81
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,760
Yes.

82
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,260
Inspector! The estimated time of death is between 7pm and 9pm.

83
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,660
If he was at Teito Station until past 8pm,

84
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,060
we can narrow down his tracks until the time he was killed.

85
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,360
I got two calls from Mr. Kusaka yesterday.

86
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,360
One was at about noon.

87
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,760
It was from his residence in Kofu.

88
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,860
He asked me if he could come and have me look over his new novel.

89
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,760
But I had to go out so...

90
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,660
I'd be back about 9 at night.

91
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,360
9pm? All right, I'll be there around that time.

92
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,460
And then I got the second call from Teito Station around 8pm.

93
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,960
Since I was out, his message was in my answerphone.

94
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,960
There is one message.

95
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,960
This is Kusaka. I've arrived at Teito Station.

96
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,060
I'm going to head over to your place from now,

97
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,960
so I think I can get there by 9pm as I promised.

98
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,360
Oh, the train's leaving, so I've got to go!

99
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,260
Saturday, 8.10pm.

100
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,560
May I listen to it one more time?

101
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,960
Sure.

102
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,560
There is one message.

103
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,660
This is Kusaka. I've arrived at Teito Station.

104
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,760
I'm going to head over to your place from now,

105
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,660
so I think I can get there by 9pm as I promised.

106
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,860
Oh, the train's leaving, so I've got to go!

107
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,960
Saturday, 8.10pm.

108
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,860
At 8.10pm, Mr. Kusaka left from Teito Station

109
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,660
to go to Beika Station.

110
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,860
There's no doubt about it.

111
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,660
But, there's something

112
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,560
about this phone call that bothers me.

113
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,060
He left the Teito Station at 8.10pm.

114
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,460
On this train!

115
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,560
Which means it takes approximately 30 minutes to Beika Station so...

116
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,660
He arrives at Beika Station at 8.40pm!

117
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,060
The crime was committed between 8.40pm to 9pm,

118
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,360
in the vicinity of Beika Station...

119
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,560
I guess this is more or less the picture!

120
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,560
I've figured out who the killer is!

121
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,160
The killer is the other disciple of Mr. Tsukigata!

122
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,760
You mean Saruhashi?

123
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,760
I hope you have your reasons for saying that.

124
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,160
Of course.

125
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,760
He said that he lives right on the other side of Beika Station,

126
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,560
so he knows his way around here.

127
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,460
And more than anything else, he has a motive!

128
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,860
I just remembered, 6 months ago,

129
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,860
they had a brawl, didn't they?

130
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,160
Are you telling me to quit being Sensei's disciple?

131
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:24,060
Mr. Saruhashi, you studied under Sensei for many years now.

132
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,660
-Haven't you studied all you have to already? -What?

133
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,860
Come, come now.

134
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,860
Mr. Kusaka, stop it already.

135
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,560
I want to study under you too, Sensei.

136
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,660
But since you can't watch two disciples...

137
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,460
That's not true, Mr. Kusaka!

138
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:45,460
You have a stable life of an employee of a company.

139
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,360
No matter where you live, there's no difference

140
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,960
in the fact that you're my disciple.

141
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,160
Whether we live near you or not,

142
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,660
it makes a difference in the amount of things we get to learn.

143
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,060
Mr. Saruhashi, please change places with me!

144
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,760
That's for Sensei to decide!

145
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,460
Worried of his position as a disciple

146
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,560
is indeed a motive for killing, but...

147
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,060
It's too childish of a motive, it's absurd.

148
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,560
This is Takagi.

149
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,060
Yes.

150
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,560
I see, goodbye.

151
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,960
It's from the forensic officer.

152
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,860
Mr. Kusaka's fingerprints were not found on the lighter in question.

153
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,660
What's this about a lighter?

154
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,760
It was found on the ground by the corpse, the lighter.

155
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,060
Excuse me.

156
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,960
This is the lighter I gave Mr. Saruhashi some time ago!

157
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,660
What?

158
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,160
Now we not only have a motive, but also have material evidence...

159
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,260
No. Saruhashi couldn't have...

160
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,860
Mr. Saruhashi, does this lighter look familiar to you?

161
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,160
It's my lighter.

162
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,360
Though I lost it some time ago.

163
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,860
Lost it? When? Where?

164
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,560
I don't know.

165
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,260
Please try to remember!

166
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,060
I really don't know.

167
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,160
It was quite some time ago, though.

168
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,360
The key to a coin locker?

169
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,560
Right.

170
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,160
It's a precious lighter that Sensei gave me as a gift.

171
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,160
I'm sure that Kusaka stole it from me because he was jealous.

172
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,760
Mr. Saruhashi!

173
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,460
Officer Takagi.

174
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,860
Mr. Saruhashi. Where were you last night?

175
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,260
Oh, yes...

176
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,560
I was at a coffee shop in front of the station about 8pm.

177
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,560
I came back here once

178
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,160
and from about 8.30pm, I went to a pub in front of the station.

179
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,660
Are you sure it was from 8.30pm?

180
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,660
Wasn't it a little later, like 9pm?

181
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,360
Huh?

182
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,160
Mr. Kusaka's estimated time of death

183
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,760
is thought to be between 8.40pm to 9pm.

184
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,760
What?

185
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:09,560
Mr. Kusaka called Tsukigata Sensei at 8.10pm from Teito Station.

186
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:16,260
So he arrived here at Beika Station after 8.40pm.

187
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,160
I went into the pub at 8.30pm!

188
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,660
I'm sure!

189
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,460
Please check on it.

190
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,260
I'm not lying.

191
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,960
Thank you so much.

192
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,060
Inspector!

193
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
As to the coffee shop,

194
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,860
it seems he was there from sundown and left about 8.30pm!

195
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,160
I got his alibi on this side too.

196
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,860
He came at 8.30pm and was drinking until midnight.

197
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,760
Which means that Saruhashi has an alibi!

198
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,360
What's going on?

199
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,760
The story about the lighter is just a cop out.

200
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,760
If Mr. Kusaka stole it, his fingerprints should be on it!

201
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,960
I'm aware of that.

202
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,760
He's got a motive and there is material evidence.

203
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,260
But he has an alibi.

204
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,860
Please wait.

205
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,860
It's possible for him to commit the crime!

206
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,760
He left the coffee shop at 8pm.

207
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,060
He came to this pub at 8.30pm.

208
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,660
There're 30 minutes of unaccounted time!

209
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,460
-And? -And he lied about returning to his apartment.

210
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:33,360
He killed Mr. Kusaka during the 30 minutes!

211
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,860
The scene of the crime is not Beika-cho,

212
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,660
but between Teito Station and Beika Station.

213
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,860
If he uses the 30 minutes that is unaccounted for to the fullest,

214
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,560
he can make it to a station in between.

215
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,960
After committing the murder there,

216
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,460
he can still make it back to Beika Station at 8.30pm.

217
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,160
The actual time the murder was committed was not 8.40pm,

218
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,060
but rather, around 8.15pm...

219
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,960
That's not possible, Officer Takagi.

220
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,960
What?

221
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,960
Mr. Kusaka left Teito Station at 8.10pm.

222
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,960
5 minutes later, at 8.15pm,

223
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,560
Mr. Kusaka is still way before

224
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,360
reaching the middle point of both stations.

225
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,460
During the 30 minutes time,

226
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,760
it'd be impossible to commit murder,

227
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,560
much less even make contact with him.

228
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,860
Impossible.

229
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,560
That is, unless you use some kind of Ninja technique

230
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,060
that is described in Ryutaro Tsukigata's novel or something...

231
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,360
Ninja technique of creating an alibi.

232
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:35,460
What kind of Ninja trick did he use?

233
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,480
What kind of trick...

234
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,280
did Mr. Saruhashi use anyway?

235
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,780
It's Tsukigata Sensei's new book.

236
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,980
Mysterious Centipede Ninja.

237
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,980
The enemy is your friend and your friend is your enemy.

238
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,280
Counter turn after counter turn.

239
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,880
Counter turn?

240
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,180
Counter?

241
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,980
I'm not lying.

242
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,780
I got two phone calls from Mr. Kusaka yesterday.

243
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,280
This is Kusaka. I arrived in Teito Station just now.

244
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:30,080
Saturday, 8.10pm.

245
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,780
I see, I get it!

246
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,480
"Beika Station, West Entrance, 2 Days Later" -If so...

247
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,580
The coin locker

248
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,580
can be used for a period of 3 consecutive days in a row.

249
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,680
0101.

250
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,980
Please be there!

251
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,580
It's there!

252
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,980
So, he's the killer, after all!

253
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:01,780
There're no hints, no matter how much I read this.

254
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,580
What brings you all here?

255
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,580
What're you talking about?

256
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,480
You're the one that told us to come here, Mr. Mouri!

257
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,380
Me?

258
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,880
I made no such phone call...

259
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,780
I did call you indeed.

260
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,680
Of course, I did so to talk to you

261
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,580
about the homicide case of Mr. Yuichi Kusaka.

262
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,380
Did you figure out the Ninja technique?

263
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:42,580
Yes, one alibi trick was used in this murder case.

264
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,780
It's a very simple trick,

265
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,180
but it was very difficult to figure it out.

266
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:52,580
Why? Because the one who used the trick was not the killer!

267
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,280
Not the killer? Then, who was it?

268
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,680
When I heard the message on the answerphone,

269
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,780
something bothered me.

270
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,680
That was because despite knowing that

271
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,880
Tsukigata Sensei was still not home a little after 8pm,

272
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,580
Mr. Kusaka called twice.

273
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,980
Why did he go out of his way to make such a phone call

274
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,480
when it really was no big deal?

275
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,280
Saturday, 8.10pm.

276
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,880
Yes, he did it only to make everybody believe

277
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,680
he was at Teito Station at 8.10pm.

278
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,280
To make everyone believe?

279
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,780
Which mean, he was actually not there?

280
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,080
Mr. Mouri, I found it!

281
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,580
Officer Takagi.

282
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,780
I found it! The ticket you asked for.

283
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,980
Ticket?

284
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,680
The ticket that was retrieved at Beika Station that day

285
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,180
with Mr. Kusaka's fingerprints on it.

286
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,580
Officer Takagi, what time was it issued?

287
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,980
Oh, yes!

288
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,880
It was sold at Teito Station... at 7.30pm?

289
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,680
What, 7.30pm?

290
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,280
It's not after 8.10pm?

291
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,780
Just as I thought.

292
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,580
He bought the ticket at 7.30pm.

293
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,580
If he boarded the train right away,

294
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:08,280
he would've reached Beika Station a little after 8pm.

295
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,980
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

296
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,380
Officer Chiba?

297
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,280
I asked Officer Chiba to do me a favor too.

298
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,780
I had him go and get the contents in the coin locker,

299
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,680
which pick up date was overdue.

300
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:24,780
That's Mr. Kusaka's bag.

301
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,380
This is the victim's belongings?

302
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,080
Is it?

303
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,880
Yes.

304
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,280
Please put the contents of the bag on the table.

305
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,980
Oh, yes!

306
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,480
Thank you.

307
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,780
Inspector! Please rewind that tape recorder a little.

308
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,980
-Teito. Teito. -Mommy, hurry!

309
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,980
It's dangerous to run, Kenichi!

310
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,080
This is?

311
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,880
It's the same as the message that was in the answerphone!

312
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,380
Yes,

313
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:10,480
Mr. Kusaka who reached Beika Station, used that to make it

314
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,580
seem as if he had reached Beika Station at 8.10pm

315
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,080
in order to create his alibi!

316
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,380
The Ninja technique of creating an alibi.

317
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,280
Once the secret is revealed, it is a very simple trick.

318
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,780
The only thing is the one who used this Ninja trick

319
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:29,080
was not the killer but the victim himself.

320
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,280
What did Mr. Kusaka do something like that for?

321
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,380
In order to kill Mr. Saruhashi!

322
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,080
After the answerphone trick, Mr. Kusaka rushed over

323
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,180
to Mr. Saruhashi's apartment.

324
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,480
I guess he told Mr. Saruhashi beforehand,

325
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,580
that he had something important to talk about or something.

326
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,480
If Mr. Kusaka were to work out the way he planned,

327
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,080
he was probably going to make an anonymous call to the police

328
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,580
right after killing Mr. Saruhashi.

329
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,480
And the time of the crime would be precisely determined

330
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,080
by the police who get there right after the call.

331
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,880
According to his alibi scheme, from between 8.10pm to 8.40pm,

332
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,380
Mr. Kusaka would be riding the train to Beika Station,

333
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,380
so he would be erased from the list of suspects.

334
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:24,180
All he had to do next was visit Tsukigata's house at 9pm as scheduled.

335
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,380
However, it didn't work out as he planned!

336
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,880
He was counterattacked by Mr. Saruhashi

337
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,780
who he meant to kill.

338
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,680
Dang it!

339
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,280
Mr. Saruhashi who counterattacked,

340
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,080
carried Mr. Kusaka's corpse to the park and disposed of it there.

341
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,780
Then, just as you already found out from investigations,

342
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,480
he went to the pub at about 8.30pm.

343
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,380
I'm not lying.

344
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:06,280
Exactly. You weren't lying.

345
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,580
You realized that the police made a mistake

346
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,780
and all you did was decide to use this to your advantage.

347
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,980
So, you're the one who killed Mr. Kusaka after all.

348
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,380
I know nothing of that sort!

349
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,880
He didn't come to my apartment!

350
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,480
No, I'm sure he did.

351
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,580
If he had intention to kill,

352
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,480
he wouldn't take the tape recorder that he used to create his alibi,

353
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,580
nor his manuscript along with him.

354
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:33,280
So, I figured that he would leave it at the coin locker of Beika Station.

355
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,080
If something is left in that locker for more than 3 days,

356
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,880
the maintenance company opens it with a spare key.

357
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,680
Since today was the 3rd day,

358
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,180
I asked Officer Chiba to go get the thing that was in the locker.

359
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,280
Mr. Kusaka's bag, that's over there.

360
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,980
But how did you figure out the number of the locker?

361
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,480
That's the point.

362
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,280
When we went over to Mr. Saruhashi's home,

363
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,480
Conan found the key to the locker in Mr. Saruhashi's room.

364
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,980
0101. It's a number easy enough for a child to remember.

365
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,680
You say that Mr. Kusaka didn't come,

366
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,580
but how can a person who didn't come

367
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,680
drop the key in your room?

368
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,580
My house...

369
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,580
He did come to my house. But...

370
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,880
It's okay already, Mr. Saruhashi.

371
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,780
Sensei...

372
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:31,580
I was afraid of him all this time.

373
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,480
Afraid that he would take you away from me.

374
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,880
I'm happy how you feel about me.

375
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,080
But whether you succeed as a professional

376
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,780
is how much effort you exert!

377
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:50,880
I guess both Mr. Kusaka and you forgot what was most important.

378
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,280
I thought this time for sure that our hands were tied.

379
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,080
But, you never let us down, do you, Mr. Mouri?

380
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,280
You mean Inspector Shiratori's new unmarked police car?

381
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,680
Oh, come on.

382
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,580
Ninja technique of playing dumb?

383
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,480
You got me there.

384
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,780
I can never beat you, Inspector.

385
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:56,380
The Ninja technique you're really good at is, "all talk", Pops.

386
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,320
Next Conan's Hint:

387
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,020
"Honeybee mark"

388
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,160
The next episode is quite surprising!

389
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,040
What a surprise. I spilled my tea.
