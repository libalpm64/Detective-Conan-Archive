1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,740
Just as flowing water has no form

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,440
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,340
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,140
A parent is a parent but not the child.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,940
Ran's challenge outdoes Kogoro.

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,540
His name is Detective Conan!

"Unseen Weapon - Ran's First Case"

10
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,690
It's so hot!

11
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,290
The Akasaka Princess Hotel's a nice hotel

12
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,990
but this hill's a killer.

13
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,890
You're so right! I'd like to change right away

14
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,790
and jump right into the pool, don't you?

15
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,890
Listen, Ran.

16
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,490
I'm going to find me a gorgeous guy

17
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,990
so don't you get in my way, understand?

18
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,590
Yes. I understand completely.

19
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,490
By the way, have you heard anything from Shinichi?

20
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,290
No. Not since he left.

21
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,390
Is he working on another case?

22
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,790
I just don't understand how one can get so worked

23
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,990
about a case.

24
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,690
Look at that car.

25
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,690
This doesn't look good!

26
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,490
Look out!

27
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,290
I'm so sorry! Are you two all right?

28
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,790
We're fine.

29
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,790
Just barely.

"Akasaka Princess Hotel"

31
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,190
So Ms. Yoshino,

32
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,090
you're an instructor at a flower design school.

33
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,390
Yes, I work at Shizuoka five days a week.

34
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,590
Did you say Shizuoka?

35
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,590
That's very far, isn't it?

36
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,990
"Chie Yoshino (31)"

37
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,490
In fact, I was on my way to school just now

38
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,790
when I remembered today was a holiday.

39
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,690
So I called my husband...

40
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,990
He works for an insurance company

41
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,290
and we made plans to meet here at this hotel.

42
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,390
We were going to have lunch.

43
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,290
Oh, I see.

44
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,690
I'm really very sorry about what happened.

45
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,990
I suddenly got dizzy and lost consciousness for a second.

46
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,390
I've been getting dizzy spells

47
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,390
and splitting headaches a lot lately.

48
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,790
Maybe you're sick?

49
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:44,290
No, the doctor couldn't find anything wrong.

50
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,490
It's probably the weather.

51
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,790
The temperature has been fluctuating

52
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,790
so radically lately, hasn't it?

53
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,690
And I guess the fatigue's been building up

54
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,890
since I have to drive to and from Shizuoka every day.

55
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,390
The proof is when there's no school

56
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,190
or when it's cool, even if it's a weekday,

57
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,390
I feel fine. Nothing happens.

58
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,890
Is that so?

59
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,590

Oh, hello.

This is Ran Mouri and Sonoko Suzuki.

64
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,990
I had another dizzy spell

65
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,790
and nearly ran them down.

66
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,190
Again?

67
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,790
Were you hurt in any way?

68
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,990
No, we're fine! Although it was a close call.

69
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,790
Your wife was nice enough to treat us to lunch.

70
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,590
I see. Please accept my apologies.

71
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,490
And how do you feel?

72
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,090
I'm okay. I felt fine after I rested a while.

73
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,690
Good. I'm so relieved.

74
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,190
He seems so nice.

75
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,190
Yes.

76
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,090
Excuse me, I think we'll be going now.

77
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,890
That's right, you were going to the pool, weren't you?

78
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,590
All right then.

79
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,790
Where do you two live?

80
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,990
In Beika.

81
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,590
Oh, that's near us.

82
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,590
We live in Haido.

83
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,090
We live very close to the park, please drop by sometime!

84
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,790
Thank you!

85
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,090
A bump?

86
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,790
What is this?

87
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,590
Ran, be careful! There's a bump here!

88
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,690
Okay.

89
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,790
"Mouri Detective Agency"

90
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,090
Well?

91
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,690
Don't you think it's strange?

92
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,090
What is?

93
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:35,890
I just told you, he knew she had just had a dizzy spell,

94
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,890
so why didn't he warn her about the bump?

95
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,090
She couldn't have gotten hurt badly if she had tripped and fell!

96
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,090
It wasn't such a big bump,

97
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,290
I don't see why you're making such a big deal out of it.

98
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,490
But Sonoko warned me about it.

99
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,090
And I'm sure that guy would too.

100
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:58,590
"That guy"? Who're you talking about?

101
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,990
Oh, nothing.

102
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,690
Anyway! I'm very curious about that couple.

103
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,990
I think I'll go over to visit Mrs. Chie and check things out.

104
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,290
And do what?

105
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,790
I want to find out what's causing her

106
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,690
to have those headaches and dizzy spells!

107
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,590
What? You're no doctor.

108
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,090
Don't poke your nose where it doesn't belong.

109
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,190
I'm not stupid, I can figure it out!

110
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,790
If you're going to insist, go ahead and try.

111
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,790
I most certainly will!

112
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,690
I've never heard her say anything like this

113
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,190
but she does have a point, something's fishy.

114
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,490
Hey, can I go with you?

115
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,590
Do you want to come with me?

116
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,090
Then I'll ask Sonoko to come along

117
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,290
and we'll all go together!

118
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,690
What do I care?

119
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,490
I guess I'll have my rice now.

120
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,790
Get it yourself!

121
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,490
What?

122
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,690
What a grouch.

123
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,890
"Yoshino's Residence"

124
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,090
Amazing!

125
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,690
This place is super nice!

126
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,190
The garden's so well cared for.

127
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,590
Your home is so beautiful!

128
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,890
Thank you!

129
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,090
We just finished building this place a month and a half ago.

130
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,190
No wonder. I had a feeling it was new.

131
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,690
A new house, how wonderful!

132
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:17,390
But carrying a loan of 40 million yen is pretty rough.

133
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,690
That's why we both have to work,

134
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,790
otherwise we'd never make ends meet.

135
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,390
Here you are.

136
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,790
Thank you.

137
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,690
I apologize for barging in on you

138
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,090
when it's your day off.

139
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,090
It's quite all right!

140
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,690
My husband went out this morning, so I'm alone today.

141
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,090
Your husband seems so nice!

142
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,790
Yes, I suppose he is.

143
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,690
He loves cars and he's been complaining lately

144
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,690
that he hasn't been able to go out

145
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,990
for drives like he used to.

146
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,790
I guess that's why he goes out walking every morning,

147
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,890
to take his mind off it.

148
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:53,390
And while he's out, I fix breakfast.

149
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,490
This may be a strange thing to ask but...

150
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,690
Why do you go all the way to Shizuoka to work?

151
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,790
To help pay for the loan.

152
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,090
I used to teach at a design school here in the city

153
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,090
but my husband told me about this school in Shizuoka.

154
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,490
The salary was better there.

155
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,390
I see.

156
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,390
But still, it's pretty hard on you, isn't it?

157
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,990
Driving there every day.

158
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,190
That's right!

159
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,190
If you took the train,

160
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,490
you'd at least be able to get some sleep.

161
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,690
Actually, I enjoy driving.

162
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,690
The entrance to the highway is near here,

163
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,590
besides, it's much more convenient

164
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,690
when you have a lot of supplies and large equipment, isn't it?

165
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,690
I guess.

166
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,390
By the way, have you kids ever thought about insurance...

167
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,190
Oh, dear! I forgot, you're still in school.

168
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,090
What was that?

169
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,390
I'm terribly sorry.

170
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,890
My husband works for an insurance company

171
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,890
and I've gotten into the habit of suggesting people to get insurance.

172
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,790
As a wife, you're helping your husband, right?

173
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,490
Yes. Well...

174
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,690
I felt bad about just suggesting it to others

175
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:02,290
so I just recently adjusted my policy to 100 million.

176
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,890
A 100 million?

177
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,990
My husband asked me to.

178
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,290
The monthly payments are very high.

179
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,090
But I get my money back

180
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,990
after a certain amount of time

181
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,490
I figured it'd make his sales rate look good.

182
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,890
You're really crazy about him, aren't you?

183
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,490
Eh? Oh, do you think so?

184
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,290
100 million yen?

185
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,990
Could it be...

186
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,990
But then...

187
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:34,390
Excuse me, when did you start having those headaches and dizzy spells?

188
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,090
Let's see.

189
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,790
About a month ago I guess.

190
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,990
A month ago.

191
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,890
That means half a month after the house was built.

192
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,790
Maybe that's what they call "sick house syndrome"

193
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,290
"Sick house syndrome"?

194
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,390
What?

195
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,490
Did you say "Shiku hakku (To be in agony)"?

196
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,890
I said "sick house syndrome"!

197
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,490
It's when people get sick from the gas given off by the lumber

198
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,090
and paint used when building a house!

199
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:11,290
Sonoko, I'm sure you've heard of formaldehyde.

200
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,490
Don't make fun of me!

201
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,090
Of course I know about those things!

202
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,890
I'm not sure. but don't think that's it.

203
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,890
Why not?

204
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,590
The contractor who built this house

205
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:26,390
is a friend of my husband's.

206
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:31,790
My husband would have told them not to use anything that was dangerous.

207
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,990
But...

208
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,290
But I still think you should have it checked out!

209
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,490
The contractor could have deceived you.

210
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,890
Sonoko! Do you know of any companies

211
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,090
that specialize in checking for contaminated building supplies?

212
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,190
Well, sure.

213
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,690
My father would probably know, we could ask him.

214
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,690
All right then, let's ask him right away!

215
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,090
Mrs. Chie, I think you should have it checked just to be safe!

216
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,890
Well, Okay.

217
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,990
Ran, you're acting strange today.

218
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,290
Why did you insist on getting her house checked?

219
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,390
I had my reasons.

220
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,590
Ran thinks Mrs. Chie's husband, Mr. Akio,

221
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:21,890
is trying to kill her to collect the insurance money.

222
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,290
What? Ran, is that true?

223
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,490
Yes.

224
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,990
What's going on?

225
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,290
First, Mr. Akio gets the contractor

226
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,090
to build the house using dangerous materials

227
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:40,290
so that Mrs. Chie's health starts getting bad.

228
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,890
And on the other hand,

229
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,990
he suggests she take the job in Shizuoka.

230
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,290
But why?

231
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,890
Mrs. Chie does as he suggests

232
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:55,090
and drives to and from work on the highway every day.

233
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,590
What if she has a dizzy spell while driving...

234
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,890
That's impossible...

235
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,190
Maybe you're overthinking it.

236
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,690
First of all, if things like that happened,

237
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,090
wouldn't the house make Mr. Akio sick too?

238
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,590
He does live in the same house too!

239
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,390
But those materials could've been used

240
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,890
only for her room and the kitchen.

241
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,090
Of course, we have no proof.

242
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,490
But as long as the possibility exists,

243
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,990
I thought it was best to check it out.

244
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,790
At this point,

245
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,890
we still didn't know

246
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,490
if Ran's suspicions were correct.

247
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,890
But something doesn't seem right.

248
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,690
I couldn't put my finger on it.

249
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,590
This is a formaldehyde detector.

250
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,190
There's a possibility that different materials were used in each room

251
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,090
so I think it's best if we checked every room to be accurate.

252
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,890
Fine, you may start anytime.

253
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,090
All right then let's begin.

254
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,690
When Chie told me about this,

255
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,790
I was shaken up

256
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,590
but then there is a possibility

257
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,190
the contractor did use those kinds of materials.

258
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,190
So I figured it might be better to have it checked.

259
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,590
-Yes, that's right. -Yes, that's right.

260
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,490
Well, I'm going for a walk.

261
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,290
I'll pick up some cake on the way back.

262
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,590
That would be nice.

263
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,690
See you later.

264
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,990
He really loves to take walks!

265
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,890
I'm going to take a walk too!

266
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,590
Hey, Conan. Don't stay out too long!

267
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,690
Okay!

268
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,990
That customer's going to buy it, isn't he?

269
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,790
Yes! He used to come in all the time on his days off

270
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,190
but I think he's made up his mind now!

271
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,990
What?

272
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,690
25 million yen!

273
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,090
Come on, is he serious?

274
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,290
We have the results!

275
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,690
Every room shows a level

276
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:38,190
much lower than 0.08 ppm

277
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,190
which is the level the Ministry of Health and Welfare

278
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,290
has declared safe four years ago.

279
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,890
Are you sure about that?

280
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,690
And what does that mean?

281
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,790
It means this house is absolutely safe!

282
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,290
What a relief.

283
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,390
I guess "sick house syndrome" has nothing to do with

284
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,590
what that is making me sick.

285
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,190
You're just tired.

286
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,990
Let's try to get to bed earlier.

287
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,590
Yes.

288
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,490
I don't understand.

289
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,790
Is there something else going on here?

290
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,380
"Mouri Detective Agency" -I told you so!

291
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:23,580
That's what happens when amateurs try to do a professional's job!

292
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:27,480
I wonder if it could just have been my imagination.

293
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,080
I hope you didn't tell them

294
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:35,180
you are the famous detective Kogoro Mouri's daughter.

295
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,380
Of course not.

296
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,880
That's good.

297
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,880
I hope this taught you

298
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,380
not to go sticking your nose into other people's business.

299
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,580
Well, answer me!

300
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,280
I understand

301
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:59,680
I guess I just can't compete with "that guy".

302
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,680
Conan.

303
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,280
Ran, I don't think you were wrong.

304
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,180
Today, I overheard the salesmen

305
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,280
at the place they sell sports cars,

306
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,680
Mr. Akio is going to buy a car

307
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,180
that costs 25 million yen!

308
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,480
25 million yen?

309
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,180
Where's he getting the money from?

310
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,380
The insurance on Mrs. Chie?

311
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,980
He is trying to kill Mrs. Chie after all!

312
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,780
Yeah. Even after he pays off the loan on the house,

313
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,480
he'll still have 60 million left.

314
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,680
But there was no sign the air in the house was contaminated.

315
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,680
Maybe he was poisoning her food.

316
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,480
But I think she does all the cooking.

317
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,780
That's right.

318
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,880
"Mouri Detective Agency"

319
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,080
What do you think?

320
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,880
How did he do it?

321
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,780
While I'm sitting here,

322
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,780
danger could be creeping up on Mrs. Chie.

323
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,280
Hey, Shinichi, what am I going to do!

324
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,480
Something's bugging me.

325
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,680
And it's been bugging me ever since Ran told me about it.

326
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,080
What is it?

327
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,480
Wait a minute.

328
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,680
I'm sure Mrs. Chie said...

329
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,080
That's it! I've figured it out!

330
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,580
You want to know what Mrs. Chie told me the first time?

331
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,680
Yeah! What did she say about her dizzy spells?

332
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,880
I'm pretty sure it's...

333
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,080
It's probably the weather.

334
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,280
The temperature has been fluctuating

335
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,480
so radically lately, hasn't it?

336
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,480
And I guess the fatigue's been building up

337
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,980
since I have to drive to and from Shizuoka every day.

338
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,580
The proof is when there's no school

339
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,480
or when it's cool, even if it's a weekday,

340
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,780
I feel fine. Nothing happens.

341
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,880
That's what she said.

342
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,380
See! If it was something in the house,

343
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,780
then wouldn't the symptoms be worse on her days off

344
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,480
when she's at home longer

345
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,580
instead of when she's out?

346
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,280
You know. You're right.

347
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,880
I think the thing that's giving her headaches

348
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,580
and dizzy spells aren't in the house.

349
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,980
Is it somewhere else?

350
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,680
Maybe at the design school in Shizuoka?

351
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,380
Or, someplace between her house and the school.

352
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,480
What?

353
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,380
Could it be...

354
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,980
"Next morning" -I'm going for my walk now.

355
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,380
Okay. Ham and eggs for breakfast okay with you?

356
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,480
Sounds good!

357
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,480
I'll be hungry when I come home

358
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,080
so make a lot!

359
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,680
Hey?

360
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,380
What are you kids doing here?

361
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,280
Mr. Yoshino, what did you just put in your pocket?

362
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,980
What?

363
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,680
It's an air conditioner disinfectant.

364
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,380
I wanted to protect Chie from cold germs and other bacteria.

365
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,680
Okay then, when the police get here,

366
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,380
you'll show that to them, won't you?

367
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,980
What?

368
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,980
I just called them.

369
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,580
A police officer that I know.

370
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,380
Police?

371
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,180
I'm sure Mrs. Chie would never have dreamed that

372
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,080
her husband, the man she trusted the most,

373
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,080
was spraying an "unseen weapon"

374
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,780
into her car's air conditioner every morning.

375
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,380
That's why Mrs. Chie never got sick when she didn't drive to work

376
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,580
or when it was cool enough

377
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,680
where she didn't have to use the air conditioner.

378
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,280
Mrs. Chie.

379
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,280
Akio.

380
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,180
Later, the police investigation showed

381
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,680
that the spray bottle contained

382
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,180
a diluted agricultural chemical composed of organic chlorine.

383
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,880
In his confession,

384
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,080
he said that he embezzled several million from his company

385
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,480
and was trying to cover the deficit

386
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,680
but he also wanted a new sports car

387
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,280
and that's why he thought up this plan.

388
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,180
You mean Mrs. Chie sold the house?

389
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,380
Yes and with some friends,

390
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,680
they opened a flower design company!

391
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,780
Look.

392
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,480
She looks good!

393
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,780
Ms. Chie Taniguchi.

394
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,480
She got a divorce and went back to her maiden name.

395
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,880
Boy, women get over things so quickly.

396
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,080
But to be suspicious of Mr. Akio Yoshino

397
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,680
just from that one step at the hotel,

398
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,480
Ran sure was sharp.

399
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,580
I'm so glad things worked out.

400
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,580
If you hadn't noticed anything and done all you did,

401
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,580
Ms. Chie might be dead now!

402
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,580
Hold on now!

403
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:24,380
Maybe you're getting to be like "you know who".

404
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,780
Don't be silly.

405
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,980
But I guess you could say I wanted to understand him a little more

406
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,080
or maybe get to feel closer to him.

407
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,080
Yes, I understand.

408
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,980
So, do you understand Shinichi a little more now?

409
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,780
No way!

410
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,980
Who can understand that mystery fanatic!

411
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,580
Whatever you say.

412
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,880
But never mind that, let's go eat some yummy cakes!

413
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,880
Let's go.

414
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,780
Well, I guess it's for the best.

415
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,280
Next Conan's Hint:

416
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,160
"Open window"

417
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,800
-The next episode... -Where does one buy a super car?

418
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,220
Is it in a super market?
