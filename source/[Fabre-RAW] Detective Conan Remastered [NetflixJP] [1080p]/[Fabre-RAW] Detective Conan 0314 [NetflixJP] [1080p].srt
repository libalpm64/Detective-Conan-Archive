The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,740
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,340
A hike to the scenic viewpoint

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,340
reveals the hidden truth behind an unfortunate accident.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,940
He sees through the one and only truth.

A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,260
Who said there are lots of girls up here?

13
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,760
Not a soul, as far as I can see, man.

14
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,960
Well, the guidebook says

15
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,660
this place is quite popular among school girls.

16
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,260
Those reporters are so irresponsible and disgusting.

17
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,360
Sure, man. Sure thing.

18
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,360
You want me to go? Okay, I will.

19
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,860
Wait a minute, Hirai!

20
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,260
What's up?

21
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,860
The place is tricky.

22
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,360
You need to be very careful when you work.

23
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,560
You're quite right.

24
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,060
We may have another fatal accident, right?

25
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,560
Well, I'll bet you'd rather like to see me get into an accident.

26
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,260
Hold it there.

27
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,660
See you guys.

28
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,960
What's wrong with him?

29
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,160
Good morning, everybody.

30
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,160
There is a broken fence at the scenic view point.

31
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,060
Please be careful.

32
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,660
All right.

33
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,060
Thank you.

35
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,460
Hold it. Wait for me, guys.

36
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,460
Why? So soon again?

37
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,760
We took a rest just a while ago.

38
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,460
Be nice, guys. We're not in a hurry.

39
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,460
Like we said, it's too much for you, old man, wasn't it?

40
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,460
Thanks for nothing.

41
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,260
I just worked too much lately and worked myself out.

42
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,960
Sure!

43
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,460
Well, Ran, let's leave the old man alone and go, shall we?

44
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,160
A good idea.

45
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,560
No, you don't! Hey.

46
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,060
Wow. What a beautiful sight.

47
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,260
Yeah.

48
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,160
He's the man we saw down there.

49
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,260
Right. What is he doing, there?

50
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,860
They said there's a broken fence.

51
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,060
He's probably working on it.

52
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,560
You're right.

53
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,260
Finally.

54
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,860
Oh. Hi, Pops.

55
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,760
You finally made it, dad.

56
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,860
He fell off.

57
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,760
Darn it!

58
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,760
Conan!

59
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,360
Watch out! What're you trying to do?

60
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,960
You want to fall off the cliff?

61
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,060
But...

62
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,460
Go down to the office and tell them about this, Ran.

63
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,560
Yes, dad.

64
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,660
Is anyone there?

65
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,460
What's the matter?

66
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,760
A man fell down the cliff.

67
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,560
What? Could it be Hirai?

68
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,660
Could be.

69
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,760
Anyway, how do we get below the view point?

70
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,060
This... this way.

71
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,760
Ran, call an ambulance and the police.

72
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,060
Sure, dad.

73
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,760
No good. He's already dead.

74
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,960
Hirai...

75
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,760
It's all my fault. My fault.

76
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,660
What do you mean, may I ask?

77
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,460
I asked him...

78
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,960
I asked him to fix the broken fence at the view point.

79
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,160
I should have gone...

80
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,260
If I do it myself, then this wouldn't have happened.

81
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,960
Why is it?

82
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,760
The two ropes that were left here are twisted

83
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,860
as if they had been tied to something for a long time.

84
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,860
Dad.

85
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,360
The police and ambulance will be here soon, they say.

86
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,560
Good.

87
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,360
Anyway, this seems to be an accident.

88
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,060
Let's leave everything here as is,

89
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,160
go back to the office and wait for the police to come.

90
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,260
Okay.

91
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,160
Conan, we are going back to the office.

92
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,260
Yeah.

93
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,960
What's this?

94
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,060
This...

95
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,160
is a spider's web and threads.

96
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,660
Why on earth is it here?

97
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,660
And where did he get it?

98
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,560
Just as I thought.

99
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,860
There was no spider's web around here and...

100
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,960
At the place where Mr. Hirai fell,

101
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,260
there are no traces of slip marks made by his boots.

102
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,960
It's as if he had jumped off the cliff.

103
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,660
Another thing puzzles me.

104
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,460
The ropes that were left beside the body

105
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,060
were twisted at both ends as if they had been tied to something.

106
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:04,660
If the rope was tied, then why Mr. Hirai fall to the ground?

107
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,360
And the way the ropes are twisted...

108
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:12,060
As if they have been tied in a knot for many hours.

109
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,360
Why did Mr. Hirai use that kind of rope?

110
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,560
It's just a hare.

111
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,960
An animal trail?

112
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,360
Conan is still out somewhere, dad.

113
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,560
Don't bother.

114
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,560
He is playing around somewhere nearby.

115
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,660
But...

116
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,260
Well, I'll go look for him.

117
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,760
There could've been an accident or something.

118
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,060
But...

119
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,660
Please stay here and wait for the police.

120
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,660
Don't worry. I'll be back with him soon.

121
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,560
Thank you.

122
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,160
He's a nice person.

123
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,760
Oh, dad!

124
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,360
This tree is...

125
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,860
the one that is sticking out from beneath the view point.

126
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,860
What's that?

127
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,660
A piton and a ring.

128
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,360
It's a mountain climber's piton and a snap ring.

129
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,860
Something strange is going on.

130
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,860
It's White-Eyes.

131
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,360
What's that?

132
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,260
Darn! I can't see clearly.

133
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,560
What're these?

134
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,460
Traces of spikes.

135
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,260
They're still new.

136
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,960
A rope can leave traces of scratch marks like this.

137
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,960
So it comes up to...

138
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,760
Hey. Conan!

139
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,560
What are you doing up there? It's not safe up there.

140
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,660
I was looking at the nest of White-Eyes.

141
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,760
Oh, you were...

142
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,960
The White-Eyes are protected birds,

143
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,560
it's better if you leave them alone.

144
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,060
Yes, sir.

145
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,060
You'd better come down right away.

146
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,860
I will, right now.

147
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,360
They are worried about you at the office.

148
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,860
Say, Mr. Kondou.

149
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,860
Your boots look very old, how come?

150
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,960
Oh, you mean these?

151
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,160
I got these when I was in college.

152
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
These are so comfortable

153
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,960
so I don't want to change them for new ones.

154
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,560
The only thing is that they're heavy.

155
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,660
Now I see it.

156
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,360
Just as I thought. This is a murder case.

157
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,860
And the culprit is this man, Mr. Eiichiro Kondou.

158
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,460
He pushed Mr. Hirai off the cliff

159
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,760
and made it look as if he fell off by accident.

160
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,160
He used these tricks.

161
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,630
I see.

162
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,530
Since there are eyewitnesses to this incident,

163
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:35,630
we can assume, as Mr. Mouri says, that this is an accident.

164
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,630
Yes, officer.

165
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,730
But if people keep falling off by accident,

166
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:47,030
you could be held responsible for the safety of the park, Mr. Kondou.

167
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,230
I have the responsibility, yes.

168
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,930
What are you talking about, may I ask?

169
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:55,530
Well, about a month ago, another worker of this office had an accident.

170
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,630
She fell off the cliff and died.

171
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,230
Oh, she did.

172
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,030
Excuse us.

173
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,430
We want to move and carry the body out, if you don't mind.

174
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,030
Sure, guys.

175
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,630
Well, everybody,

176
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,430
we need to draw up a report at the police station,

177
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,730
so please come with us.

178
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,430
Yes, officer.

179
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,030
Wait a while, everybody.

180
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,430
Dad?

181
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,930
What's the matter, Mr. Mouri?

182
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:39,830
There is some doubt about Mr. Hirai's death being an accident.

183
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,530
What's that, Mr. Mouri?

184
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:47,530
Ran, when the man fell off the cliff, did you see his face?

185
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,530
No. I didn't, dad.

186
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:54,130
You didn't. Conan says he didn't either.

187
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,930
And I didn't either.

188
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:02,930
That is, the man that fell off may not have been Mr. Hirai.

189
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:07,430
But if he was not Mr. Hirai,

190
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:11,530
where did he disappear to?

191
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:14,730
Mr. Kondou, you probably know that

192
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:20,030
there is a tree sticking out just below the view point.

193
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,630
-Is that right? -Yes, there is a tree

194
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,130
but it's not a large one

195
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,630
and I don't think it can hold a falling man by any chance.

196
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:33,930
True. It's unlikely that the man got stuck to the tree by chance.

197
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,830
If that someone actually fell off...

198
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,030
What do you mean by that?

199
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:43,030
The man at the view point did not fall off,

200
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,730
he jumped off deliberately,

201
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,430
so he could make the people who witnessed the fall,

202
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,830
think that they saw Mr. Hirai fall to his death.

203
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,130
So, this is a homicide.

204
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,430
Right.

205
00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:00,730
This is not an accident, but a case of murder.

206
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:12,030
Then, who on earth is the culprit?

207
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:16,230
The culprit is the person who knew that Mr. Hirai

208
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,030
was expected to go repair the fence.

209
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,930
He is also someone who could prepare

210
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:24,730
the same clothing that Mr. Hirai wore.

211
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,130
In other words...

212
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,030
It's...

213
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:32,030
none other than you, Mr. Kondou.

214
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,230
Then it's like this,

215
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:42,330
Mr. Kondou pushed Mr. Hirai off the cliff,

216
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,030
then waited for Mr. Mouri and the others to arrive,

217
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,330
which after he jumped down on to the tree.

218
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:51,730
No, that way the time that Mr. Kondou jumped off

219
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,530
would be different from the time Mr. Hirai fell off.

220
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:00,330
Since we came up here as tourists,

221
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,230
we approached the view point completely

222
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,130
irrelevant of what Mr. Kondou had in mind.

223
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,130
That is, we could've arrived five minutes

224
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,230
after Mr. Kondou pushed Mr. Hirai over the cliff,

225
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:16,030
or it could've been one hour later.

226
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:22,130
Then, how on earth was he able to do that?

227
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,830
The tree.

228
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,930
The tree?

229
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:29,730
Yes. Mr. Kondou jumped onto the tree,

230
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:33,230
where Mr. Hirai was already was.

231
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,330
Mr. Kondou jumped down onto the tree

232
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,730
and pushed Mr. Hirai off the tree.

233
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,730
That explains it.

234
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,630
That way, there would be practically no time difference what so ever.

235
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,730
But how could he dare do something like

236
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:52,130
risk his life jumping off the view point like that?

237
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,430
Well...

238
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,730
I wouldn't say it was such a great risk.

239
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:03,030
Conan found a mountain climber's piton with a snap ring

240
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,630
driven into the rock above the tree,

241
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,630
just below the edge of the cliff at the view point.

242
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:12,630
Probably, early this morning or last night,

243
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:17,730
Mr. Kondou prepared two ropes and tied them to the snap ring.

244
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,230
He put one of the ropes through the tree below

245
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,530
and fastened the rope in place,

246
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:26,030
then he wound the other rope to the pole of the fence

247
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,430
and tied it in place.

248
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:33,930
When he saw us coming to the park, he chose us to be witnesses.

249
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:38,030
And told Mr. Hirai to go repair the fence.

250
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,330
Mr. Kondou saw us go, and then,

251
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:47,330
he ran into the path in the back of the office to short cut us.

252
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:51,830
The climbers' path to the view point is the long way around,

253
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:55,330
so it wouldn't have been difficult for him to get there before us

254
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,530
if he ran straight through the mountain.

255
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:02,730
Then he ambushed Mr. Hirai, knocked him out,

256
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,830
and put him on the tree beneath the view point.

257
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,830
He waited for us to arrive,

258
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,830
then took the rope that he had tied onto the fence,

259
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,930
tied it around his body as his lifeline, and jumped off.

260
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:21,030
Mr. Kondou who was suspended in air with the lifeline,

261
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:24,630
took the rope that was tied onto the tree,

262
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,430
untied the lifeline, let go of it,

263
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,730
then climbed up the rope he was holding and landed on the tree.

264
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,130
He then untied the rope as he previously did with the other rope

265
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,730
and let go of it.

266
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,230
In the end, he pushed Mr. Hirai off the tree.

267
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,430
You're talking nonsense!

268
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,030
It's a whole lot of nonsense!

269
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:51,130
Everything is your imagination! There's no proof!

270
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,630
I passed him out and kept him on the tree, you say?

271
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,230
You're talking nonsense.

272
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,130
If you have any proof, show me!

273
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,630
The nest of the White-Eyes.

274
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:05,830
You know that there's a nest of White-Eyes, don't you, Mr. Kondou?

275
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,830
Wha... what about it?

276
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,430
When the White-Eyes make their nest,

277
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:14,230
they collect twigs and weeds and bind them using spiders' webs.

278
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:19,030
There was a web on the right side of Mr. Hirai's body.

279
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,230
I saw a spider's web.

280
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:28,230
So, it's there, but what does it have to do with me?

281
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,430
I said, show me proof that I did it!

282
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:35,930
There were traces of metal spikes on the trunk of the tree.

283
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,930
The spikes of mountain climbing boots.

284
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:43,330
I've heard that because of improved quality,

285
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,330
mountain climbers' boots nowadays have no metal spikes

286
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,230
since they are slip-proof even without them.

287
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:54,730
Mr. Kondou, you've been using your boots since your college days.

288
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,330
Why?

289
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:59,930
Are your boots spiked, Mr. Kondou?

290
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,230
Darn it!

291
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:23,230
That Hirai, he kept on picking alpine plants

292
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,230
and capturing the protected animals

293
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,430
to sell them at premier prices.

294
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:33,730
She... I mean the worker who died, and I were after him

295
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:36,530
wanting evidence of what he was doing.

296
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:43,930
And that evening, we caught him in the act.

297
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:47,530
But, while I was struggling with him,

298
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:51,230
my arm hit her and...

299
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:12,830
She fell off the cliff.

300
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:22,930
Since then, Hirai has been blackmailing me.

301
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,230
I couldn't put up with him any longer.

302
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:36,930
But maybe this was all for the better.

303
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:44,330
I can finally amends for what I did to her.

304
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,430
I thought he had enough sleep already.

305
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,930
Apparently not.

306
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,630
What's the matter, dad?

307
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,630
Let me have them.

308
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,530
Hey, don't. You can't.

309
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,030
No, it's not what you think.

310
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,730
Just what're you peeking at, dad?

311
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,330
Well, it just so happens that...

312
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,830
You're looking through the binoculars of your own initiative

313
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,830
and you dare say it just so happens that!

314
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,330
Like I said, it just so happens that I...

315
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,930
What're you going to do if Conan gets interested

316
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:34,930
and tries to take a look?

317
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,330
I told you, it just happened to come into view!

318
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,130
-My. You dirty old man. -You obstinate dumbbell of a girl.

319
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,230
-I'm telling mum about this! -What?

320
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,130
Hey! This is none of her business, is it?

321
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,530
Don't blame me for what happens to you after she finds out!

322
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,530
Hey, you wait.

323
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:53,330
-No way! -Please. Ran, dear.

324
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,930
Pops, just what did you happen to see?

325
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,080
Next Conan's Hint:

326
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,180
"A nightingale"
