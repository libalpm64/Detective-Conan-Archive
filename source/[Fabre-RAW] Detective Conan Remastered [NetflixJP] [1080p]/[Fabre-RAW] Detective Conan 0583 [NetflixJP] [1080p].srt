1
00:00:14,321 --> 00:00:16,321
Good morning.

2
00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:21,021
Good morning.

3
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:24,421
How come you look so untidy?

4
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:26,005
"Smoking Room"

5
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:27,621
If you're a police detective,

6
00:00:27,621 --> 00:00:29,121
you should dress and groom yourself like one.

7
00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:31,021
I can't help it, can I?

8
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:34,021
I was staking out all night till just a while ago.

9
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:37,021
Geez.

10
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:39,521
The least you can do is fix your necktie right.

11
00:00:39,521 --> 00:00:43,021
It's okay because I finished reporting

12
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:45,321
and all I have to do today is go home and sleep already.

13
00:00:45,321 --> 00:00:47,821
Hey, stop moving.

14
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:49,021
Okay.

15
00:00:58,421 --> 00:01:00,039
It... it's okay already.

16
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,821
I'll do the rest myself.

17
00:01:01,821 --> 00:01:03,821
Thank you so much.

18
00:01:03,821 --> 00:01:06,045
I'll go on home then.

19
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:07,621
Gosh.

20
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:09,721
Wait up, Officer Takagi.

21
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:11,221
Wait for me.

22
00:01:14,621 --> 00:01:18,621
-No... -Officer Takagi sure is outright open nowadays.

23
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:20,421
It seems the number of times they have meals together

24
00:01:20,421 --> 00:01:22,621
is also increasing day by day.

25
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:24,063
I've also heard unverified information

26
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:26,065
that they've kissed too.

27
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:27,121
-What? -What?

28
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:29,421
Without even consulting me?

29
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:30,421
Well...

30
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:32,621
It's like I said merely unverified information.

31
00:01:32,621 --> 00:01:35,121
Then, go confirm it right away.

32
00:01:35,121 --> 00:01:36,621
-You're a detective, aren't you? -Hey.

33
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:39,221
-How about it, Shiratori? -What?

34
00:01:39,221 --> 00:01:41,721
What's going on between Takagi and Sato.

35
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:46,085
You're in charge of completely guarding Miwako Sato, aren't you?

36
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:48,721
If it's those two,

37
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:51,021
I think it's turning out the way it should.

38
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:53,621
It seems they both have feelings for each other too.

39
00:01:53,621 --> 00:01:58,097
Besides, I gave away being in charge to somebody else.

40
00:01:58,097 --> 00:01:59,621
So, if you will excuse me...

41
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:01,521
Hey, Shiratori!

42
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,721
What's come over him?

43
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:05,321
According to some tips I got,

44
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:07,721
it seems Mr. Shiratori has another girlfriend.

45
00:02:07,721 --> 00:02:08,921
-What? -What?

46
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:12,111
Something about she being a split double of Ms. Sato.

47
00:02:12,111 --> 00:02:14,121
Who and where the hell is she?

48
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,521
Brooding over passing seasons

49
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:38,521
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

50
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:40,521
Ms. Kobayashi encounters a case.

51
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:42,621
Inspector Shiratori is her bodyguard?

52
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,143
He sees through the one and only truth.

53
00:02:44,143 --> 00:02:46,145
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

54
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:48,147
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

55
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:17,951
"Ms. Kobayashi's Love Affair"

56
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:21,651
Yes. I got it.

57
00:04:21,651 --> 00:04:24,243
You don't want me walking around alone at night, right?

58
00:04:24,451 --> 00:04:26,251
No. If possible,

59
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:29,751
I'd like you not to go out after 9 pm.

60
00:04:29,751 --> 00:04:34,951
Because there are a lot of muggings in the area that you live now.

61
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:37,051
I saw it on the news this morning.

62
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:39,251
The culprit seems to be a woman.

63
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:40,251
Yes.

64
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:42,261
But...

65
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:44,051
Why?

66
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:47,151
Why do you give me a call all the time?

67
00:04:47,151 --> 00:04:50,269
Because I'm worried.

68
00:04:50,451 --> 00:04:52,051
Does it bother you?

69
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:54,051
No. It's the other way around,

70
00:04:54,051 --> 00:04:55,451
you're helping me a lot.

71
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:57,451
I'm glad.

72
00:04:57,451 --> 00:05:00,551
Please be very careful then.

73
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:03,651
Yes. Thank you so much for going out of your way to call me.

74
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:09,751
Teacher.

75
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:12,751
I've been trying to tell you from a while ago

76
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:14,651
that we finished cleaning the rabbit cage already.

77
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:18,297
You children were monitors for cleaning the rabbit cage

78
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:20,299
during summer vacation.

79
00:05:20,451 --> 00:05:21,751
Good work.

80
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:24,951
Was the call just now from Inspector Shiratori?

81
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:29,751
Yes, but how did you know?

82
00:05:29,751 --> 00:05:31,951
It's easy to tell.

83
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:34,951
Your face is red, teacher.

84
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:38,317
No... no way. I'm not blushed.

85
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:39,151
And?

86
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,651
Did he tell you already that he likes you?

87
00:05:45,351 --> 00:05:47,651
What? Why?

88
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:49,351
I guess not.

89
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:52,051
Doesn't Inspector Shiratori look familiar?

90
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,151
Familiar?

91
00:05:53,151 --> 00:05:56,851
Like, have you seen him when you were a child?

92
00:05:56,851 --> 00:05:58,651
Come to think of it...

93
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:00,051
When I first saw him,

94
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:03,651
it felt like it wasn't the first time.

95
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:05,451
It was like a strange drawer

96
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:08,347
that was deep inside my heart opened.

97
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:11,051
Then, the clue is bookstore.

98
00:06:11,051 --> 00:06:12,151
Bookstore?

99
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:15,351
Inspector Shiratori told us to not say anything

100
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:16,951
about the incident at the bookstore

101
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:19,251
when he saved Ms. Kobayashi from some shoplifters

102
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:23,351
because he wants to tell her himself, didn't he?

103
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:24,851
Right.

104
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,251
Well, I'm sure he's waiting for the right timing to tell her,

105
00:06:27,251 --> 00:06:30,369
so that he can touch her heart.

106
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:32,371
How frustrating, don't you think?

107
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:34,373
Don't tell me that...

108
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:35,451
The book titled

109
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:38,151
"The 30 Mistakes of the Mystery Man with 30 Faces"

110
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:39,951
is going on the market today, isn't it?

111
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:41,351
Yes.

112
00:06:41,351 --> 00:06:42,381
Good.

113
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:45,351
I forgot to reserve it so I've got to go buy it today.

114
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:47,951
Then, you'd better go get it quickly.

115
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:50,051
The bookstore that you always go to

116
00:06:50,051 --> 00:06:53,751
is going to be closing early today because of fireworks.

117
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:56,395
Really? Then, I'd better hurry.

118
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:59,851
Oh, right. Talking of fireworks, are you all going too?

119
00:06:59,851 --> 00:07:00,851
Yes.

120
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:04,403
We're going to gather at 6 pm at Conan's place and go.

121
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:06,751
How unusual.

122
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,151
I thought you always got together at Dr. Agasa's place

123
00:07:09,151 --> 00:07:10,851
and then go together?

124
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:15,251
Doctor has to help his friend move, so he can't go.

125
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:17,651
Then, is Detective Mouri going as chaperon?

126
00:07:17,651 --> 00:07:20,051
Pops said that he's going to watch fireworks

127
00:07:20,051 --> 00:07:21,551
with his neighbors and drink.

128
00:07:21,551 --> 00:07:24,051
Ran is at summer training with her Karate Club.

129
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:27,151
We're going by ourselves. Does it bother you?

130
00:07:27,151 --> 00:07:29,451
Of course, it bothers me.

131
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:35,351
"Mouri Detective Agency" -She's late!

132
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:38,437
We'd better hurry or it'll start.

133
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:40,951
Well, I'm sure she'll come soon.

134
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:44,751
Teacher! Ms. Kobayashi!

135
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:47,051
Hurry, hurry!

136
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:48,851
You're late.

137
00:07:48,851 --> 00:07:50,151
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:52,251
I had trouble buying the book.

139
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,351
The first one already went up.

140
00:07:59,351 --> 00:08:01,351
Really, if we went by ourselves,

141
00:08:01,351 --> 00:08:02,751
we would've made it in time.

142
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:06,151
No way. Children shouldn't walk around at night.

143
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:09,151
There's a mugger attacking people in this area recently,

144
00:08:09,151 --> 00:08:11,151
so you've got to be careful.

145
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:15,151
And, did Inspector Shiratori tell you that?

146
00:08:15,151 --> 00:08:16,851
Yes.

147
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:19,951
Inspector Shiratori is head over heels over her.

148
00:08:19,951 --> 00:08:23,451
Well, I guess he couldn't leave me alone

149
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:25,951
because I'm not that reliable.

150
00:08:25,951 --> 00:08:27,751
But...

151
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:31,651
Not being able to leave you alone is the same as, "like."

152
00:08:32,651 --> 00:08:34,493
Really?

153
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:35,851
You think so?

154
00:08:35,851 --> 00:08:38,251
Yes. I'm positive.

155
00:08:41,151 --> 00:08:43,751
But...

156
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:47,751
Even so, I wonder how he would do as a boyfriend?

157
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:49,651
After all, he's a police detective,

158
00:08:49,651 --> 00:08:51,151
so if he's going after a dangerous culprit,

159
00:08:51,151 --> 00:08:53,751
I'd have to worry.

160
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:58,051
But being able to listen to stories of different cases, may be fun.

161
00:08:58,051 --> 00:09:00,851
Because like you know, I just love mysteries.

162
00:09:00,851 --> 00:09:01,851
Right?

163
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:06,525
Where'd they all go?

164
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:09,951
"Cotton Candy"

165
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,851
"Fried Noodles"

166
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:16,951
There are so many open air stalls.

167
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:18,537
I want to eat cotton candy.

168
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:21,151
They have fish scooping too.

169
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,651
Ms. Kobayashi's not around, is she?

170
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:26,851
I did tell her that we were going to take the short cut.

171
00:09:30,951 --> 00:09:32,551
Hey.

172
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:34,553
Where are all of you?

173
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:37,651
Conan?

174
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:40,951
They could never be in a place like this.

175
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:43,451
Where could they be?

176
00:09:43,451 --> 00:09:44,563
Right.

177
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:47,451
I guess I'll mail Inspector Shiratori.

178
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:49,151
"Inspector. There's trouble."

179
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:52,571
"5 children disappeared in a puff of smoke."

180
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:55,551
-Pretty good. -Never mind, just give me that!

181
00:09:55,551 --> 00:09:56,575
I'm going to kill you.

182
00:10:01,151 --> 00:10:03,451
Somebody's having an argument with somebody.

183
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:05,951
Don't tell me that...

184
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,151
it's the mugger?

185
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:10,589
I'm calling the inspector.

186
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:13,951
But, if I'm wrong, I'd be troubling him.

187
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:16,951
Only if Conan and the others were here...

188
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,351
Right.

189
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:23,651
It could be that they've gotten mixed up in it too.

190
00:10:23,651 --> 00:10:26,605
I've got to confirm either way.

191
00:10:42,251 --> 00:10:43,251
What?

192
00:10:45,851 --> 00:10:48,051
What's with that person?

193
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:53,651
No.

194
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:01,851
Ms. Kobayashi sure is late.

195
00:11:01,851 --> 00:11:02,951
Geez.

196
00:11:04,151 --> 00:11:06,251
Hey, you guys.

197
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:08,647
I'm going to go get Ms. Kobayashi

198
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:09,751
so stay around here, okay?

199
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:11,551
-Okay. -Okay...

200
00:11:12,851 --> 00:11:14,951
Hey.

201
00:11:14,951 --> 00:11:16,051
Hello.

202
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:20,251
Are you all right?

203
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:33,751
Ms. Kobayashi?

204
00:11:35,151 --> 00:11:37,151
Oh, no.

205
00:11:37,151 --> 00:11:38,351
Why...

206
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:47,051
Ms. Kobayashi?

207
00:11:47,051 --> 00:11:48,151
Don't come.

208
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:50,051
If you come now, that person will attack...

209
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:53,051
He's gone.

210
00:11:53,051 --> 00:11:54,151
Ms. Kobayashi.

211
00:11:55,551 --> 00:11:58,697
There was somebody there till a while ago, right?

212
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:03,051
The person who killed this man.

213
00:12:14,302 --> 00:12:17,002
Come on, Ms. Kobayashi.

214
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,102
Don't tense up like that.

215
00:12:19,102 --> 00:12:22,721
But... this is the first time I ever came here.

216
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:27,602
You were called to come here because you witnessed a murder.

217
00:12:27,602 --> 00:12:31,002
It's not that you're going to be interrogated for committing a crime

218
00:12:31,002 --> 00:12:32,731
so I don't see why you're not more relaxed.

219
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:34,102
I guess so.

220
00:12:34,102 --> 00:12:35,802
I've come here so many times,

221
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:41,102
that I've eaten everything on the restaurant menu they have here.

222
00:12:41,102 --> 00:12:43,102
That's eating too much.

223
00:12:43,102 --> 00:12:45,102
Miwako.

224
00:12:45,102 --> 00:12:46,302
Hi.

225
00:12:46,302 --> 00:12:48,502
Have you come here for interrogation with the brats?

226
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,302
What's with that outfit of yours?

227
00:12:52,302 --> 00:12:54,753
You're even wearing glasses and all.

228
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:56,502
Are you changing your image?

229
00:12:56,502 --> 00:12:58,202
No.

230
00:12:58,202 --> 00:12:59,302
"No."

231
00:12:59,302 --> 00:13:01,402
Hey, are you asleep yet or what?

232
00:13:01,402 --> 00:13:03,302
Shape up.

233
00:13:05,602 --> 00:13:08,002
Did you just say, "kyah?"

234
00:13:08,002 --> 00:13:10,002
Just what do you think you're doing?

235
00:13:10,002 --> 00:13:11,702
What am I doing?

236
00:13:11,702 --> 00:13:13,702
Miwako, are you sure you don't have a fever or something.

237
00:13:13,702 --> 00:13:15,702
No, Yumi.

238
00:13:15,702 --> 00:13:17,202
She is...

239
00:13:17,202 --> 00:13:18,202
Ms. Sato.

240
00:13:19,602 --> 00:13:21,402
The children have come.

241
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:26,102
Wasn't the school teacher supposed to come too?

242
00:13:26,102 --> 00:13:28,202
So, like I said, she is...

243
00:13:28,202 --> 00:13:32,202
The homeroom teacher of Teitan Elementary, First grade, Class B,

244
00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:35,802
and also an important witness to the murder that occurred,

245
00:13:35,802 --> 00:13:38,002
Ms. Sumiko Kobayashi.

246
00:13:38,002 --> 00:13:39,902
Please don't mistake her for someone else.

247
00:13:41,502 --> 00:13:45,702
Okay, please give us the details in that room over there.

248
00:13:45,702 --> 00:13:46,805
Yes.

249
00:13:50,602 --> 00:13:52,811
You've got be kidding.

250
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:57,202
Excuse me, is there somebody that looks like me?

251
00:13:57,202 --> 00:14:00,819
Yes. Although I don't think that you look that much alike.

252
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:06,502
Well... I think, maybe a little bit?

253
00:14:06,502 --> 00:14:10,002
Are we by chance going to the interrogation room?

254
00:14:10,002 --> 00:14:12,831
No, just to a plain conference room.

255
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:14,102
I see.

256
00:14:14,102 --> 00:14:15,902
You look a bit disappointed.

257
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:16,835
Oh, no...

258
00:14:17,002 --> 00:14:19,702
I was just a bit interested.

259
00:14:19,702 --> 00:14:24,843
Is the girl that Shiratori is head over heels with?

260
00:14:25,002 --> 00:14:28,002
I've kept hearing that they resembled each other but...

261
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:30,402
I didn't think that she looked that much like Ms. Sato.

262
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,202
I was surprised too

263
00:14:32,202 --> 00:14:34,853
when I first met her.

264
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:36,102
Right, right.

265
00:14:36,102 --> 00:14:37,702
Yes. But, well...

266
00:14:37,702 --> 00:14:39,502
the way she talks and her character too

267
00:14:39,502 --> 00:14:42,202
are completely opposite so... Ouch.

268
00:14:42,202 --> 00:14:45,302
Who's the complete opposite of me?

269
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:46,302
Oh, no...

270
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,502
Well, well,

271
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:50,869
he's just saying that you're more police detective like and manly.

272
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:52,602
What? What's that supposed to mean?

273
00:14:54,873 --> 00:14:56,102
Well, never mind.

274
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:58,602
The three suspects for the murder case were brought here,

275
00:14:58,602 --> 00:15:00,502
so let's start interrogation.

276
00:15:00,502 --> 00:15:01,502
Yes, ma'am.

277
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:05,902
As for those two,

278
00:15:05,902 --> 00:15:08,887
since Mr. Shiratori, who was their setback pulling out of the picture,

279
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:11,402
they're headed straight toward reaching their goal.

280
00:15:11,402 --> 00:15:13,802
Well, as for me,

281
00:15:13,802 --> 00:15:17,802
it's a bit boring that I don't get to get Shiratori all worked up

282
00:15:17,802 --> 00:15:19,702
and tease him anymore.

283
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,202
"Conference Room"

284
00:15:22,202 --> 00:15:23,802
I see.

285
00:15:23,802 --> 00:15:25,902
So, if I organize what you just told me,

286
00:15:25,902 --> 00:15:28,702
you were with the children on your way to watch fireworks

287
00:15:28,702 --> 00:15:30,102
and lost them partway.

288
00:15:30,102 --> 00:15:31,902
So you were looking for them.

289
00:15:31,902 --> 00:15:36,202
Then you heard two people arguing with each other.

290
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:40,202
And then you went into the back alley to check things out

291
00:15:40,202 --> 00:15:43,302
and saw the killer run off.

292
00:15:43,302 --> 00:15:48,702
In addition, when you screamed at finding the body of the victim,

293
00:15:48,702 --> 00:15:52,502
Conan came running to the scene?

294
00:15:52,502 --> 00:15:54,102
Yes, sir.

295
00:15:54,102 --> 00:15:56,702
I'd like to just confirm with you once again,

296
00:15:56,702 --> 00:15:59,402
but the corpse that you found was...

297
00:15:59,402 --> 00:16:03,202
Mr. Akira Sumida, is that correct?

298
00:16:05,202 --> 00:16:08,002
Yes. I think so.

299
00:16:08,002 --> 00:16:08,947
And do you remember

300
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:14,953
what Mr. Sumida was arguing about with the killer?

301
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:17,902
Well... I could hear them,

302
00:16:17,902 --> 00:16:19,702
but their conversation was erased by the sound of the fireworks,

303
00:16:19,702 --> 00:16:20,959
so I can't say...

304
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,402
But, I remember clearly that the killer woman

305
00:16:24,402 --> 00:16:26,202
was shouting at the top of her lungs

306
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:28,702
because she did so when no fireworks were shot up.

307
00:16:28,702 --> 00:16:32,702
She said, "Never mind, just give me that. I'll kill you."

308
00:16:32,702 --> 00:16:33,902
I see.

309
00:16:33,902 --> 00:16:37,702
That's why I thought that she was the mugger

310
00:16:37,702 --> 00:16:39,902
that frequently appeared in the area.

311
00:16:39,902 --> 00:16:44,102
No, we arrested the mugger at sunset the same day.

312
00:16:44,102 --> 00:16:47,602
But, what makes you think that the killer is a woman?

313
00:16:47,602 --> 00:16:49,802
Is it because you heard her shout?

314
00:16:49,802 --> 00:16:53,002
The silhouette of the killer that ran off.

315
00:16:53,002 --> 00:16:55,402
She had quite a breast.

316
00:16:55,402 --> 00:16:58,402
Besides, I think she had her long hair tied in the back

317
00:16:58,402 --> 00:17:00,102
and was wearing a cap.

318
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:02,702
I'm pretty sure.

319
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:05,902
You didn't get to see the killer's face?

320
00:17:05,902 --> 00:17:08,002
No, sir. Because it was dark.

321
00:17:08,002 --> 00:17:13,602
But, the killer may have remembered your face, right?

322
00:17:13,602 --> 00:17:15,013
Why do you think so?

323
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:18,102
Because I'm not the only one who went running over

324
00:17:18,102 --> 00:17:20,002
after hearing Ms. Kobayashi screamed.

325
00:17:21,002 --> 00:17:22,202
What did you say?

326
00:17:22,202 --> 00:17:23,502
Then, don't tell me that...

327
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:25,023
Isn't that right, Ms. Kobayashi?

328
00:17:25,202 --> 00:17:29,702
Yes. The killer seems to have been watching me

329
00:17:29,702 --> 00:17:31,702
from some distance away.

330
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:35,033
The killer disappeared when Conan came, though.

331
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:36,502
That's dangerous.

332
00:17:36,502 --> 00:17:37,702
There's no guarantee that the killer won't come back

333
00:17:37,702 --> 00:17:39,502
and attack you to shut you up.

334
00:17:39,502 --> 00:17:40,502
What?

335
00:17:40,502 --> 00:17:42,502
No need to worry.

336
00:17:42,502 --> 00:17:44,102
We the members of the Youth Detective Squad

337
00:17:44,102 --> 00:17:45,802
will spend the night at Ms. Kobayashi's place.

338
00:17:45,802 --> 00:17:49,047
We won't let the killer lay a finger on you.

339
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:51,302
All of you.

340
00:17:51,302 --> 00:17:53,802
No. No need for that.

341
00:17:55,702 --> 00:18:00,402
Because I, Ninzaburo Shiratori will protect you

342
00:18:00,402 --> 00:18:03,061
over my dead body.

343
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:04,002
Thank you.

344
00:18:10,102 --> 00:18:12,702
I don't mean to bring you down

345
00:18:12,702 --> 00:18:15,702
but don't you have to ask us any questions,

346
00:18:15,702 --> 00:18:18,202
although we got to the scene right after Conan did?

347
00:18:18,202 --> 00:18:21,502
Yes. Okay, well let me ask you

348
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:25,083
if you didn't see any figure run off.

349
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,085
We didn't.

350
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:30,002
You sound like you're just asking out of routine.

351
00:18:30,002 --> 00:18:33,702
Oh, no. Didn't Mr. Agasa witness anything?

352
00:18:33,702 --> 00:18:34,802
He was with you, wasn't he?

353
00:18:34,802 --> 00:18:37,095
Dr. Agasa couldn't come

354
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:39,097
because he had to help his friend move.

355
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:40,302
Move?

356
00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:43,602
Come to think of it, before the two started arguing,

357
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:45,602
I saw what looked to be the truck of movers,

358
00:18:45,602 --> 00:18:47,902
go off from near the alley.

359
00:18:47,902 --> 00:18:49,802
What? Really?

360
00:18:49,802 --> 00:18:52,202
Yes. I couldn't tell the model of the car

361
00:18:52,202 --> 00:18:54,702
because it was blocked off by the wall.

362
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:58,002
But, there was a large number 09 written on the truck.

363
00:18:58,002 --> 00:19:00,902
How do you know they are movers

364
00:19:00,902 --> 00:19:02,802
if numbers are written on the truck?

365
00:19:02,802 --> 00:19:06,302
The only cars with company telephone numbers printed on them

366
00:19:06,302 --> 00:19:08,702
are those of the movers or couriers.

367
00:19:09,702 --> 00:19:13,131
If that truck was parked there for a while,

368
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:17,135
someone may have seen the two arguing.

369
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:18,802
Let's have that checked out right away.

370
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:24,702
Then could we sort on home already?

371
00:19:24,702 --> 00:19:27,802
Yes, you children may leave.

372
00:19:27,802 --> 00:19:31,802
But, Ms. Kobayashi, will you bear with me a while longer?

373
00:19:31,802 --> 00:19:32,902
Just now

374
00:19:32,902 --> 00:19:35,153
we have three suspects that have been brought here

375
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:38,802
who have grudges against the victim and lack of alibi.

376
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,159
And, if you remember the killer's voice,

377
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:43,161
I'd like you to confirm it.

378
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:45,163
Yes, sir.

379
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:49,167
But, before that...

380
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:52,402
What is it?

381
00:19:52,402 --> 00:19:54,402
If it's the restroom, would you like me to go with you?

382
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:55,902
I know where it is.

383
00:19:56,902 --> 00:19:58,702
Really?

384
00:20:00,002 --> 00:20:02,102
I'm going along too then.

385
00:20:05,502 --> 00:20:08,202
Okay, I'll be right back then.

386
00:20:08,202 --> 00:20:09,602
Take your time.

387
00:20:14,602 --> 00:20:20,402
Telling a lady to take her time in the restroom is rude.

388
00:20:20,402 --> 00:20:23,702
It's as if you're saying that teacher's going to...

389
00:20:23,702 --> 00:20:27,702
No way. I didn't mean to insinuate anything.

390
00:20:29,002 --> 00:20:34,202
And, what did this woman victim used to do?

391
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:37,902
She owned a pawn shop.

392
00:20:37,902 --> 00:20:40,302
Hey, please wait a minute.

393
00:20:40,302 --> 00:20:41,502
She's a woman?

394
00:20:41,502 --> 00:20:42,502
Yes.

395
00:20:42,502 --> 00:20:45,223
This shirt is worn right side in front,

396
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:46,702
so it's ladies' wear.

397
00:20:46,702 --> 00:20:50,702
The name Akira can be used for a woman or a man too.

398
00:20:50,702 --> 00:20:52,302
I see.

399
00:20:52,302 --> 00:20:55,602
Well, it seems that she used to get angry frequently

400
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:57,802
because people mistook her for being a man.

401
00:20:57,802 --> 00:21:01,002
On the other hand, there seems to have been a lot of people

402
00:21:01,002 --> 00:21:02,902
who were angry at her evil ways of doing business.

403
00:21:03,902 --> 00:21:05,243
Sorry to keep you waiting.

404
00:21:06,302 --> 00:21:09,602
The children aren't back yet?

405
00:21:13,702 --> 00:21:15,253
The restrooms in the police station

406
00:21:15,502 --> 00:21:17,702
are like any other restrooms.

407
00:21:17,702 --> 00:21:19,257
Most naturally.

408
00:21:27,502 --> 00:21:28,902
What am I talking about?

409
00:21:28,902 --> 00:21:30,602
Why shouldn't I meet her?

410
00:21:30,602 --> 00:21:31,702
Well...

411
00:21:31,702 --> 00:21:33,271
That's because there are many things involved.

412
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:35,802
A lot of things involved, is not an answer, is it?

413
00:21:35,802 --> 00:21:37,802
But...

414
00:21:37,802 --> 00:21:38,902
She really is here.

415
00:21:38,902 --> 00:21:40,702
The one who looks just like me.

416
00:21:40,702 --> 00:21:42,502
If I remember correctly, her name is...

417
00:21:42,502 --> 00:21:45,283
Ms. Miwako Sato.

418
00:21:45,283 --> 00:21:46,702
How envious...

419
00:21:46,702 --> 00:21:50,402
I wanted to be a woman detective too.

420
00:21:50,402 --> 00:21:54,702
Really, that Takagi is making lovey dovey again

421
00:21:54,702 --> 00:21:57,302
with our Ms. Miwako.

422
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:02,402
I think he's getting carried away

423
00:22:02,402 --> 00:22:04,602
because Shiratori backed off.

424
00:22:04,602 --> 00:22:05,702
Yes.

425
00:22:05,702 --> 00:22:12,002
After all, he was the top in charge of protecting Miwako Sato.

426
00:22:12,002 --> 00:22:15,313
Shiratori, really made out, didn't he?

427
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:19,302
Yes. I didn't think she would look that much like Sato.

428
00:22:19,302 --> 00:22:22,202
I wonder if there's another one somewhere?

429
00:22:22,202 --> 00:22:24,502
That teacher's the last.

430
00:22:24,502 --> 00:22:25,902
Yes, right?

431
00:22:25,902 --> 00:22:28,402
Ms. Kobayashi. Thank you for waiting.

432
00:22:30,602 --> 00:22:32,602
What's the matter, Ms. Kobayashi?

433
00:22:33,802 --> 00:22:34,902
Ms. Kobayashi?

434
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:04,150
Next Conan's Hint:

435
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,360
"Shouting".
