1
00:00:04,854 --> 00:00:06,454
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:06,454 --> 00:00:08,354
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:08,354 --> 00:00:10,054
Today's case has a slightly different taste.

4
00:00:10,054 --> 00:00:11,754
Solving the trick consisting of three flavours.

5
00:00:11,754 --> 00:00:13,754
Let's taste the joy of problem solving.

6
00:00:13,754 --> 00:00:15,354
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:15,354 --> 00:00:16,954
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:16,954 --> 00:00:19,354
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,319
What's with that sigh?

10
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,619
I didn't sigh.

11
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:05,619
I was just wondering if Ran's doing okay at the tournament.

12
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:08,119
Of course she's okay.

13
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,419
I mean she practiced as much as she did,

14
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,219
and went to sleep early last night, too.

15
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:13,219
She's doing just fine.

16
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:14,619
I guess so.

17
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,719
Huh?

18
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:18,719
What's up?

19
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,019
-I've been telling you... -It's the owner of the sweets shop.

20
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:24,819
-So, I'm saying that's not it. -The police officer is Mr. Kinoshita.

21
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:27,519
What seems to be the matter?

22
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:29,519
Mr. Mouri, what a good timing.

23
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:32,519
Mr. Mouri, please hear me out.

24
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:36,219
-Mr. Mouri, we're having a problem. -Mr. Mouri, we're having a problem.

25
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,119
Hold it.

26
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:42,019
I have this uncomfortable premonition.

27
00:02:43,619 --> 00:02:49,319
"Spicy, Bitter and Sweet Flavour"

28
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:53,319
So what you're saying is...

29
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:56,519
Etsuko, you saw a man running out of room 105

30
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,519
on the first floor of this condo.

31
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,519
The time this happened was about two hours ago at 9:00 in the morning.

32
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,919
And Officer Kinoshita, you came here after Etsuko reported this to you.

33
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,919
Yes, sir.

34
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:13,619
Then you found the corpse of Ms. Fumie Ozawa, the woman renting this room,

35
00:03:13,619 --> 00:03:16,319
and concluded that she committed suicide.

36
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,119
It can't be a suicide!

37
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:19,619
But...

38
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:23,819
Listen. I saw the scene with my very eyes.

39
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,319
There was a suicide note and the room was not messed up.

40
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,719
But...

41
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:31,319
Besides, there are no other eye-witnesses

42
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:34,019
who saw the suspicious man you saw.

43
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,719
But I saw him for sure.

44
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,619
Come on! Please tell him, Mr. Mouri.

45
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:42,019
Tell him to investigate the incident more thoroughly!

46
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:43,019
What?

47
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,119
Now, now.

48
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:47,919
And is there a possibility that it was made to look like suicide?

49
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:53,319
I had the medical examiner come over and investigate just in case, but...

50
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,219
Judging from the degree of post-mortem rigidity,

51
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:56,919
the estimated time of death

52
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:00,419
is thought to be between 6:00 to 8:00 last night.

53
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:03,919
If the man she says she witnessed committed the crime,

54
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,819
he would've had to stay with the dead body for more than 13 hours,

55
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:10,419
after killing the victim and setting up the suicide.

56
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:12,819
It is unthinkable under normal terms.

57
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,019
I'm getting nowhere talking to you!

58
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:17,219
Let's have Mr. Mouri decide.

59
00:04:17,219 --> 00:04:19,519
Mr. Mouri! Please tell us what you think.

60
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,219
Well, I'm sure in a fix.

61
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:26,319
You don't look to be in a fix to me.

62
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,619
Officer Kinoshita!

63
00:04:39,619 --> 00:04:43,219
This is the man I saw! There's no mistake about it.

64
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:45,019
Oh, don't touch it!

65
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,119
But...

66
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,819
The victim is the person who lives here, Ms. Fumie Ozawa, age 24.

67
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:56,619
She works for financial institution.

68
00:04:56,619 --> 00:04:58,319
When I found the body,

69
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,719
she had a wire that was suspended from the shower nozzle around her neck,

70
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:06,719
with her body leaning against the wall and sitting down.

71
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:10,319
What a strange place to choose to commit suicide though.

72
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,319
Mr. Mouri, please look over here.

73
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,219
There is a will written using the computer.

74
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,819
"Chairman Shimizu of the loan department,

75
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:22,419
I am sorry for the trouble I have caused.

76
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:25,119
I will take my life so please accept my apologies."

77
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,619
The contents of the suicide note

78
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:30,019
is that she had embezzled more than 30,000,000 yen of company money,

79
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:31,919
so that she would like to apologize by taking her own life.

80
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,019
She addressed this to her superior.

81
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:35,619
Embezzlement?

82
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:39,619
She sent this mail out yesterday at 5:45 in the evening.

83
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:42,219
I think she died soon after that.

84
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,619
You stay out of this, brat!

85
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:02,319
Manner mode?

86
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,419
At home?

87
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:10,519
It seems that this will be concluded

88
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:13,319
as suicide just as Officer Kinoshita says.

89
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,419
Please look at the calendar!

90
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:18,119
She's got a dentist appointment.

91
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:19,519
Calendar?

92
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:28,419
It's true that she has a dentist appointment written for today.

93
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:31,419
You sure have good eyes, Etsuko.

94
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:34,219
You can see what's written from there?

95
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:36,519
Yes. Well, sort of...

96
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:40,119
A calculated suicide to the point of getting a wire ready.

97
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:44,119
Would such a person make a dentist appointment for today?

98
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:45,319
Wait a second.

99
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:49,819
Officer Kinoshita, this may possibly not be a case of suicide.

100
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:53,719
So she was killed by the man in that picture, right?

101
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:56,519
No, I can't really answer that yet.

102
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:01,919
Officer Kinoshita, was this room locked or unlocked when you came here?

103
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,919
The door was not locked.

104
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,519
Which means she committed suicide without locking the door.

105
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:11,319
Rather, a person who commits suicide

106
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:13,919
would probably be reluctant to be found in the act.

107
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,019
The picture that was found at the front entrance was peeled off from here.

108
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,219
Hey!

109
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:19,819
Hey, Pops.

110
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:24,219
The victim must have been close with the man in this picture,

111
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:27,619
but isn't there a suicide note addressed to him?

112
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:29,319
Huh?

113
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:31,119
Pops, I wonder what this is?

114
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,419
There's some kind of white powder here.

115
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:44,419
It hurts.

116
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,419
It has no smell and is dry.

117
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:01,719
I think this powder is edible.

118
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:06,119
I think this is cornstarch.

119
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,819
What else can you use cornstarch for other than cooking?

120
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,819
Well, for making Japanese sweets.

121
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:15,219
Rice cake filled with sweet beans is also covered with cornstarch.

122
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:20,819
Inspector, the money that Ms. Ozawa was in charge of at her company,

123
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,719
a sum of about 30,000,000 yen is missing.

124
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:26,619
Her superior, Mr. Shimizu is off today.

125
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:30,219
Which means he doesn't know that Ms. Ozawa committed suicide.

126
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:34,719
And we've also come up with something unexpected.

127
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,319
This man who is loading the cooler box is where she sent her mail to.

128
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,019
He is her superior, Mr. Shimizu.

129
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:43,419
You mean her superior was going out with her?

130
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:45,319
Nobody in the company seems to have known

131
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:48,219
that they were going out with each other.

132
00:08:48,219 --> 00:08:51,719
Moreover, it seems that Shimizu liked gambling

133
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:54,019
and invested a lot of money into it.

134
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:55,219
Inspector.

135
00:08:55,219 --> 00:08:57,719
It sounds fishy, don't you think?

136
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:59,219
Excuse me, Inspector.

137
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:03,619
It's him!

138
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:05,619
The one who came out of this room.

139
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:08,219
Tell the truth!

140
00:09:08,219 --> 00:09:09,919
What are you talking about?

141
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,919
And excuse me for being rude, but who are you?

142
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,419
-Please get out of the way and don't interfere. -It's this guy. It's him.

143
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:16,319
Inspector, he is Mr. Shimizu.

144
00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:19,119
He was resting at home, but I asked him to come.

145
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:29,919
Getting right down to business,

146
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,819
did you know that Ms. Ozawa who was working under you,

147
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:35,819
had embezzled a sum of 30,000,000 yen?

148
00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:39,019
"Ryota Shimizu (30)" -No. The officer informed me of it.

149
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:40,319
I was utterly surprised.

150
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:45,219
Weren't you going out with Ms. Fumie Ozawa?

151
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:47,519
If so, it would seem natural that she would discuss the matter with you.

152
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,519
We weren't going steady or anything.

153
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,619
You're referring to that picture that you had?

154
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:55,919
Ms. Ozawa said that she wanted to try going fishing once,

155
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,519
so I took her fishing with me.

156
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,119
Where were you this morning, a little after 9:00?

157
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:02,619
What do you mean?

158
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:07,119
Someone saw you come fleeing out of this room.

159
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:08,119
Me?

160
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:09,619
No use playing dumb!

161
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:12,419
I saw you clearly with these eyes of mine.

162
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:13,919
I'll be straightforward with you.

163
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:19,619
Didn't you come here this morning at 9:00 and kill Ms. Fumie Ozawa?

164
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,519
Are you trying to say

165
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,519
that I used Ms. Ozawa to embezzle money from the company and killed her?

166
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,319
Yes. After you sucked sweet honey, and sucked it all,

167
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:31,419
you got rid of her and...

168
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:32,719
Wait.

169
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,119
I didn't do it.

170
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:37,219
I had a class reunion with the classmates of my elementary school days

171
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,919
and was in Hiroshima yesterday.

172
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,519
So at about 9:00 this morning,

173
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:43,919
I was at the airport in order to board the plane headed for Haneda.

174
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:46,019
This is the cut half of the plane ticket.

175
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:54,119
Then, where were you last night from 6:00 to 8:00?

176
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:55,919
I was in the midst of the class reunion.

177
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,719
This is the name card of the person in charge.

178
00:10:58,819 --> 00:10:59,919
Please let me have it for a while.

179
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,419
Sure.

180
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:02,419
Go check on it.

181
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:03,419
Yes, sir.

182
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:05,819
Mr. Shimizu has an alibi.

183
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:09,419
But Etsuko insists that she definitely saw him.

184
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,019
If this is not a suicide case...

185
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:33,819
How was it?

186
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:36,419
Wasn't what that man said an outright lie?

187
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:40,219
It was just as Mr. Shimizu had said.

188
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:41,819
I confirmed with the chairman of the class reunion

189
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:43,619
as well as the airline company.

190
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:46,319
I see.

191
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:50,319
Etsuko probably mistook someone else to be Mr. Shimizu.

192
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:51,619
But Etsuko has good eyes, doesn't she?

193
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:56,219
Because she was able to see the words on the calendar from far away, right?

194
00:11:56,219 --> 00:11:59,319
Then, are you saying that she wanted to set Mr. Shimizu as the killer?

195
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:00,619
For what?

196
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:03,719
It's totally Greek to me.

197
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:06,119
Where's Officer Horita?

198
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:08,719
He is questioning a courier at the entrance of the condo

199
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:10,819
because the courier seems to have seen something.

200
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:14,419
Since my alibi's been established,

201
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:16,419
I guess I'll get heading home then.

202
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,519
No, you don't.

203
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,019
Don't let him go. He is a killer!

204
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,519
Etsuko.

205
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,219
What a woman.

206
00:12:28,219 --> 00:12:31,219
Do you have a grudge against me or something?

207
00:12:31,219 --> 00:12:33,519
Do you have proof that I'm the killer?

208
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,119
I do.

209
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:38,919
I knew her since she was a little child.

210
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:43,519
She thought of me as her mother and told me everything about herself.

211
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,819
She told me that she was going out with a person called Shimizu.

212
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:49,519
She also confessed to me that she embezzled money from the company

213
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,919
under his orders.

214
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,819
What a thing to say.

215
00:12:57,419 --> 00:12:58,619
Stop it.

216
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:05,819
It was on vibrator. That was ticklish.

217
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:08,019
Yes, this is Mouri.

218
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:10,719
The thing that medical examiner asked for?

219
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:14,119
She has no bad teeth? You mean Ms. Fumie Ozawa?

220
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:16,919
But she had a dentist appointment.

221
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:20,019
No. Thank you very much.

222
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:23,219
Nothing is wrong with her teeth, and yet she had a dentist appointment?

223
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,519
Excuse me.

224
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:26,519
I don't want to be a bother,

225
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,419
but I don't think this is Ms. Ozawa's writing on the calendar.

226
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:34,919
Since I'm her superior, I used to see her writing all the time.

227
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:39,619
We can't say for sure until we get it evaluated,

228
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:41,719
but it does look different.

229
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:44,519
Then who wrote in the calendar?

230
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:51,119
From what I hear, this woman here is the one who first found the body?

231
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:53,219
I see. I understand now.

232
00:13:53,219 --> 00:13:56,619
It's not unusual for the first person to find the body is the killer.

233
00:13:56,619 --> 00:14:00,419
Well, it's too bad that Etsuko is the killer.

234
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:02,719
Just what do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

235
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:06,319
Etsuko wanted to set Mr. Shimizu up as the killer.

236
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:08,319
That's why she set it up

237
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:10,719
so that it looked to be as if Fumie had a dentist appointment.

238
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:13,119
She also peeled the picture from the album

239
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:15,519
and put the picture at the front entrance for everyone to see.

240
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,519
Etsuko, just in case,

241
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,619
could you write the word dentist for me, please?

242
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:24,019
It's that woman over there, but are you sure?

243
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:26,519
Yes, I am.

244
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,119
She hid it here.

245
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:36,519
Inspector.

246
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:38,019
What is this?

247
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:41,319
What?

248
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:44,119
Etsuko,

249
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:49,019
you came into this room a little after 9:00 this morning today, didn't you?

250
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:50,019
No.

251
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:55,419
The driver of a courier saw you come out of this room.

252
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:59,419
Moreover, you seemed to be in a rush and bumped into him.

253
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,819
There's five million yen here.

254
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:07,619
Can you explain where this money came from

255
00:15:07,619 --> 00:15:12,119
and why you hid it in the gas meter box?

256
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:16,319
I brought the money from my house.

257
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:21,619
I hid it because when I went to report Fumie's death to the police.

258
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:24,919
I didn't want to drop it just in case.

259
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:28,319
So you did come into this room after all.

260
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:29,319
No, I haven't.

261
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:33,319
You killed Ozawa yourself and tried to set me up as the killer.

262
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:35,119
Just what do you think you're saying?

263
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:38,519
Mr. Mouri, please don't listen to what this man is saying.

264
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,219
Well, what a predicament.

265
00:15:41,219 --> 00:15:45,219
It's a lie. One of the two is lying.

266
00:15:45,219 --> 00:15:47,419
Etsuko or Mr. Shimizu, which of them is the killer?

267
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,719
What's this?

268
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:56,719
The scale of a fish?

269
00:15:56,719 --> 00:15:58,119
Why would something like this be here?

270
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:00,319
Maybe...

271
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,319
I see. So that's the story.

272
00:16:13,718 --> 00:16:15,518
I did write it

273
00:16:15,518 --> 00:16:18,418
and I am the one who put the picture there, too.

274
00:16:18,418 --> 00:16:21,118
Was it to put the blame of the crime on Mr. Shimizu?

275
00:16:21,118 --> 00:16:23,118
No, that's not it.

276
00:16:23,118 --> 00:16:25,918
I did it to have Mr. Shimizu arrested.

277
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,818
I came to this room this morning.

278
00:16:28,818 --> 00:16:30,618
I was going to accompany Fumie

279
00:16:30,618 --> 00:16:32,418
who said she was going to turn herself into the police.

280
00:16:32,418 --> 00:16:34,718
I brought money along with me

281
00:16:34,718 --> 00:16:38,618
thinking that returning some money would make what she did a bit lighter.

282
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:46,518
I just knew that Mr. Shimizu was responsible

283
00:16:46,518 --> 00:16:49,118
for the way I found Fumie.

284
00:16:49,118 --> 00:16:52,718
She told me that she was going to confess everything to the police.

285
00:16:52,718 --> 00:16:58,018
But there is nothing in this room that hints that Mr. Shimizu did anything.

286
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,418
That's why you put the picture in the front entrance

287
00:17:00,418 --> 00:17:03,618
and schemed writing what you did on the calendar.

288
00:17:03,618 --> 00:17:05,718
The killer is Mr. Shimizu!

289
00:17:07,018 --> 00:17:11,518
But Etsuko, that's your side of the story

290
00:17:11,518 --> 00:17:14,118
and we can't believe it completely.

291
00:17:14,118 --> 00:17:17,018
After all, Mr. Shimizu does have an alibi.

292
00:17:17,018 --> 00:17:21,018
We'd like to know where you got such a sum as five million yen, too.

293
00:17:21,018 --> 00:17:23,318
So would you please come to the police?

294
00:17:27,718 --> 00:17:30,218
Mr. Mouri, thank you for waiting.

295
00:17:30,218 --> 00:17:32,818
This is Mr. Inoue, who works at the ice making shop.

296
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,418
Ice making shop? What's this about?

297
00:17:35,418 --> 00:17:40,218
Just as you had assumed, ice had been bought.

298
00:17:40,218 --> 00:17:42,118
Officer Sato and Officer Horita,

299
00:17:42,118 --> 00:17:45,518
take her to the police and hear her out, will you?

300
00:17:45,518 --> 00:17:46,618
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

301
00:18:01,518 --> 00:18:03,418
Inspector, please wait.

302
00:18:03,418 --> 00:18:05,118
What is it?

303
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,318
Mr. Mouri! Did it start?

304
00:18:08,318 --> 00:18:11,718
Let that person go right away.

305
00:18:11,718 --> 00:18:16,118
The one who needs to go to the police is you, Mr. Shimizu.

306
00:18:16,118 --> 00:18:18,018
Why do I have to go to the police?

307
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:22,218
Mr. Inoue, when did he come to buy ice?

308
00:18:22,218 --> 00:18:23,618
Yesterday afternoon.

309
00:18:23,618 --> 00:18:27,318
He came to buy four blocks of ice totalling 15 kilograms.

310
00:18:27,318 --> 00:18:31,118
I remember him because he brought a large cooler box along with him.

311
00:18:31,118 --> 00:18:33,418
At this time of year,

312
00:18:33,418 --> 00:18:36,918
how long does it take for ice to melt and disappear?

313
00:18:36,918 --> 00:18:40,018
At normal room temperature, about half a day.

314
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,618
Thank you for taking time out to come here.

315
00:18:42,618 --> 00:18:45,718
No problem.

316
00:18:45,718 --> 00:18:48,018
Thank you very much.

317
00:18:49,818 --> 00:18:51,018
Officer Sato.

318
00:18:51,018 --> 00:18:54,718
If you look underneath the bathtub cover, you will find a fish scale.

319
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,118
Please remove the wires from it and bring it here.

320
00:18:57,118 --> 00:18:59,118
A fish scale in the bathroom?

321
00:19:00,318 --> 00:19:01,518
Mr. Shimizu.

322
00:19:01,518 --> 00:19:03,418
Around yesterday afternoon,

323
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:06,318
you probably put Ms. Ozawa to sleep using sleeping pills.

324
00:19:06,318 --> 00:19:08,918
Then you carried her into the bath tub.

325
00:19:08,918 --> 00:19:11,818
You made her sit on the bench you made using ice

326
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,418
and the lid of the bathtub and left.

327
00:19:14,418 --> 00:19:18,418
As the ice melts the bench lowers and chokes her neck.

328
00:19:18,418 --> 00:19:21,818
At the estimated time of her death between 6:00 to 8:00 last night,

329
00:19:21,818 --> 00:19:23,418
half the ice would've melted.

330
00:19:23,418 --> 00:19:26,718
And this morning, when Etsuko found her,

331
00:19:26,718 --> 00:19:30,118
the ice had melted and the floor of the bathtub was dry.

332
00:19:31,118 --> 00:19:34,518
It may have been stuck to the cooler box that you loaded the ice with.

333
00:19:34,518 --> 00:19:37,818
A fish scale was on the lid of the box.

334
00:19:37,818 --> 00:19:42,018
Does that serve as proof that I killed her?

335
00:19:42,018 --> 00:19:46,918
Listen, Ms. Ozawa sent me mail at 5:45 in the evening.

336
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:52,118
How can a person who is asleep with wire around her neck do that?

337
00:19:52,118 --> 00:19:53,418
Conan.

338
00:19:53,418 --> 00:19:57,218
Will you put Ms. Ozawa's cell phone in the open space of the book shelf?

339
00:19:57,218 --> 00:19:59,718
Stick about half of it out though.

340
00:19:59,718 --> 00:20:01,018
Okay.

341
00:20:09,218 --> 00:20:12,018
The cell phone is on manner mode.

342
00:20:12,018 --> 00:20:15,218
Officer Sato, please call Ms. Ozawa's cell phone.

343
00:20:15,218 --> 00:20:16,618
Yes, sir.

344
00:20:27,918 --> 00:20:30,018
If you look at the history of incoming calls,

345
00:20:30,018 --> 00:20:33,718
you will notice that she received a call a little before 5:45.

346
00:20:33,718 --> 00:20:36,718
No, but I didn't do it.

347
00:20:36,718 --> 00:20:38,018
I was in Hiroshima.

348
00:20:38,018 --> 00:20:40,918
You sure are obstinate!

349
00:20:40,918 --> 00:20:44,418
Officer Sato, please look at the place where the wire is tied.

350
00:20:44,418 --> 00:20:47,718
You'll see hair stuck to it.

351
00:20:47,718 --> 00:20:51,318
Don't you see hair other than Ms. Ozawa's hair that is dyed?

352
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:53,518
There is.

353
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:56,218
Something that looks like straight black hair.

354
00:20:56,218 --> 00:20:59,918
Mr. Shimizu, when you carried Ms. Ozawa,

355
00:20:59,918 --> 00:21:03,618
your hair got tangled with Ms. Ozawa's hair.

356
00:21:03,618 --> 00:21:05,618
However, you did not realize it.

357
00:21:05,618 --> 00:21:07,718
Mr. Shimizu, it will be obvious whose hair it is

358
00:21:07,718 --> 00:21:10,218
once we get it evaluated by the forensic officers.

359
00:21:14,718 --> 00:21:16,718
I'm sorry.

360
00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:19,718
She said that she couldn't continue any longer,

361
00:21:19,718 --> 00:21:22,318
and that she would turn herself in to the police.

362
00:21:22,318 --> 00:21:23,418
That's why I...

363
00:21:30,618 --> 00:21:33,318
You drank a lot of sweet honey,

364
00:21:33,318 --> 00:21:37,018
so from now you're going to have to drink a lot of bitterness.

365
00:23:34,118 --> 00:23:36,918
You sure were fantastic!

366
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:40,018
Mr. Mouri, Inspector Megure was saying

367
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:41,918
that your plan of letting Shimizu suck sweet candy first

368
00:23:41,918 --> 00:23:45,218
then giving him the blow was utterly splendid.

369
00:23:45,218 --> 00:23:46,718
That a pinch of salt is necessary

370
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:49,118
to bring out the full effect of sweetness.

371
00:23:56,818 --> 00:23:59,918
Maybe I should shake a little salt on you, too?

372
00:24:32,045 --> 00:24:33,645
Next Conan's Hint:

373
00:24:33,645 --> 00:24:36,245
"Cell phone lock"

374
00:24:36,245 --> 00:24:37,445
Why isn't Officer Takagi in this episode?

375
00:24:37,445 --> 00:24:39,245
I think it's because the title to this episode is sweet flavour.

376
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:40,645
Officer Sato.
