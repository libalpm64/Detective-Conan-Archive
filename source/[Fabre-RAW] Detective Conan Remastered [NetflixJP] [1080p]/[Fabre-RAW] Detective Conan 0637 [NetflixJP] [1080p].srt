1
00:00:02,314 --> 00:00:06,414
Pops was scheduled to make an appearance on the iconic show,

2
00:00:06,414 --> 00:00:09,414
"The Most Useful School in the World" from Nichiuri TV.

3
00:00:09,414 --> 00:00:12,614
While visiting the TV station where the filming would take place,

4
00:00:12,614 --> 00:00:14,814
the prominent enka singer,

5
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:17,814
Mr. Noburo Kimijima, who was also appearing on the same show

6
00:00:17,814 --> 00:00:20,714
showed off his proud vase to us.

7
00:00:20,714 --> 00:00:24,214
The appraisal of his vase was to be conducted during the show.

8
00:00:24,214 --> 00:00:26,014
According to Mr. Kimijima,

9
00:00:26,014 --> 00:00:28,914
it was valued at over 100 million yen.

10
00:00:29,814 --> 00:00:35,414
However, that vase suddenly disappeared during the rehearsal.

11
00:00:35,414 --> 00:00:38,214
Could someone have stolen it?

12
00:00:38,214 --> 00:00:39,514
If that was the case,

13
00:00:39,514 --> 00:00:42,314
the culprit would have to be in this studio.

14
00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:50,414
Like the fog clears.

15
00:00:50,414 --> 00:00:52,514
Let's see through love and crime as well.

16
00:00:52,514 --> 00:00:54,314
Surfacing from that popular show

17
00:00:54,314 --> 00:00:56,414
is the mystery of the sudden missing vase.

18
00:00:56,414 --> 00:00:58,114
He sees through the one and only truth.

19
00:00:58,114 --> 00:00:59,914
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:00:59,914 --> 00:01:02,214
His name is Detective Conan!

21
00:02:43,846 --> 00:02:47,746
"The Most Useful School in the World Case (Part 2)"

22
00:02:55,546 --> 00:02:57,646
Will you hear me out, Mr. Kimijima?

23
00:02:57,646 --> 00:02:59,746
Since the beginning of the rehearsal,

24
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:02,846
I haven't stepped out of the studio at all.

25
00:03:02,846 --> 00:03:05,746
Well, it isn't just Principal Sakai.

26
00:03:05,746 --> 00:03:09,646
If I'm right, no one carried any personal belongings

27
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:13,746
large enough to contain a vase, out of the studio during rehearsal.

28
00:03:13,746 --> 00:03:16,346
"Mikihiko Kamisuwa (52)" -Anyway, let's split up

29
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:18,546
"Nichiuri TV's Producer" -and search the studio carefully one more time.

30
00:03:34,546 --> 00:03:37,746
"Daisuke Tsuchiya (45), Director" -It's nowhere to be found.

31
00:03:37,746 --> 00:03:39,946
Did it vanish just like that?

32
00:03:39,946 --> 00:03:41,446
Vanished?

33
00:03:41,446 --> 00:03:43,446
It's not like it's a magic vase.

34
00:03:43,446 --> 00:03:46,046
There's no way it could have vanished on its own!

35
00:03:46,046 --> 00:03:48,346
"Noburo Kimijima (67)" -That's a vase from the Qing Dynasty

36
00:03:48,346 --> 00:03:50,146
"Leading Figure in Enka" -with an estimated value of 100 million yen!

37
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:53,346
I'm sure someone was dazzled by its worth

38
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:55,546
and hid it away with the intent to steal it!

39
00:03:55,546 --> 00:03:56,546
Calm down, calm down.

40
00:03:56,546 --> 00:03:59,346
We can't be sure about that at this point.

41
00:03:59,346 --> 00:04:01,846
The sudden disappearance of an item...

42
00:04:01,846 --> 00:04:05,246
That reminds me. Mr. Takikawa conducted an interesting experiment

43
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,546
in his lab last week.

44
00:04:07,546 --> 00:04:10,746
A fake flower placed on top of a pot filled with rice

45
00:04:10,746 --> 00:04:12,946
disappeared all of a sudden.

46
00:04:12,946 --> 00:04:16,546
The truth was that a hose was inserted from underneath the flower pot.

47
00:04:16,546 --> 00:04:17,746
When air was pumped out from it,

48
00:04:17,746 --> 00:04:19,646
the rice grains above floated with a swoosh.

49
00:04:19,646 --> 00:04:22,546
The force supporting the flower plummeted in an instant,

50
00:04:22,546 --> 00:04:24,946
causing the fake flower to sink into the rice.

51
00:04:24,946 --> 00:04:27,746
That's why it looked as if it disappeared.

52
00:04:27,746 --> 00:04:30,446
But that trick is not applicable to this case.

53
00:04:31,446 --> 00:04:34,946
As such, someone among us has to be the culprit.

54
00:04:36,446 --> 00:04:39,346
I have a request, Mr. Mouri.

55
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:42,846
Once and for all, can we rely on the deductions

56
00:04:42,846 --> 00:04:45,346
of the great detective, Kogoro Mouri to find the vase?

57
00:04:45,346 --> 00:04:48,146
Kindly lend us your strength again.

58
00:04:48,146 --> 00:04:50,746
But even if you say so...

59
00:04:50,746 --> 00:04:51,846
It'll be all right.

60
00:04:51,846 --> 00:04:54,846
I'm sure Mr. Mouri can find the vase without fail!

61
00:04:54,846 --> 00:04:57,146
Of... Of course, I will!

62
00:04:57,146 --> 00:04:58,446
All right, then!

63
00:04:58,446 --> 00:05:00,446
The great detective Kogoro Mouri

64
00:05:00,446 --> 00:05:05,146
shall definitely recover Mr. Kimijima's vase without fail!

65
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:07,046
Leave everything to me!

66
00:05:07,046 --> 00:05:08,546
All right.

67
00:05:08,546 --> 00:05:12,746
Will dad be all right after blowing up a huge balloon of confidence?

68
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,346
Well, he has to do his best now.

69
00:05:15,346 --> 00:05:19,546
Now, according to the testimony of the assistant director, Mr. Hashimoto,

70
00:05:19,546 --> 00:05:21,146
"Yoshinari Hashimoto (22)" -Up until the end of rehearsal

71
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:22,446
"Assistant Director" -for the first period,

72
00:05:22,446 --> 00:05:25,146
the vase was definitely still there.

73
00:05:25,146 --> 00:05:29,046
Yeah. I was checking the props.

74
00:05:29,046 --> 00:05:31,646
I also witnessed the vase at that time.

75
00:05:31,646 --> 00:05:36,046
That said, if we assume that somebody stole that vase,

76
00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:40,246
they would've had to do it during the second period rehearsal.

77
00:05:40,246 --> 00:05:43,146
While we were paying full attention to the puffed grain candy machine,

78
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:47,046
they seized the opportunity, stole Mr. Kimijima's vase,

79
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:51,146
and hid it somewhere in the studio in the blink of an eye.

80
00:05:51,146 --> 00:05:53,446
However, we've searched everywhere just now,

81
00:05:53,446 --> 00:05:55,546
but we still couldn't find the vase.

82
00:05:55,546 --> 00:06:00,346
No. There is still a place we haven't searched yet.

83
00:06:00,346 --> 00:06:03,246
Mr. Yamazaki, let me ask you one thing.

84
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:04,946
"Tetsushi Yamazaki (32)" -What is it?

85
00:06:04,946 --> 00:06:07,246
Regarding the storage case of the puffed grain candy machine,

86
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:11,546
you were the one who checked its content, weren't you?

87
00:06:11,546 --> 00:06:12,646
Yeah.

88
00:06:12,646 --> 00:06:13,846
Are you sure

89
00:06:13,846 --> 00:06:18,946
we won't find Mr. Kimijima's vase inside it?

90
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:21,246
Hold... Hold on a moment!

91
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:23,546
Are you suspecting me now?

92
00:06:23,546 --> 00:06:27,846
Mr. Yamazaki, you have a motive.

93
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,546
During my rehearsal for the first period,

94
00:06:30,546 --> 00:06:34,546
you were secretly taking pictures of Ms. Yoko.

95
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:35,746
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:35,746 --> 00:06:38,046
I'm a fan of Yoko, so I couldn't help...

97
00:06:38,046 --> 00:06:41,946
If you're a fan of her, you should respect her even more!

98
00:06:48,146 --> 00:06:49,946
Mr. Kimijima was furious at you

99
00:06:49,946 --> 00:06:51,946
for taking pictures of Ms. Yoko without permission.

100
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:55,146
So he snapped your cell phone in half.

101
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:57,046
Holding a grudge against him for that,

102
00:06:57,046 --> 00:07:02,046
you stole Mr. Kimijima's vase to get back at him, didn't you?

103
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,246
What nonsense.

104
00:07:03,246 --> 00:07:07,946
If you say so, why not show us what's inside your case?

105
00:07:07,946 --> 00:07:10,246
When I was testing my puffed grain candy machine,

106
00:07:10,246 --> 00:07:12,746
I remained on set the entire time!

107
00:07:12,746 --> 00:07:16,546
How on earth would I have time to steal the vase?

108
00:07:16,546 --> 00:07:20,146
That's precisely where the blind spot is.

109
00:07:20,146 --> 00:07:25,546
At that time, I believe nobody kept their eyes on you the entire time.

110
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:27,946
So why didn't you do the hammering yourself

111
00:07:27,946 --> 00:07:30,146
instead of asking Ms. Yoko to do it?

112
00:07:30,146 --> 00:07:34,446
Everyone's eyes were fixed on the candy machine in that instant.

113
00:07:34,446 --> 00:07:40,146
Therefore, I believe no one was able to witness your whereabouts.

114
00:07:40,146 --> 00:07:41,646
That's just your assumption!

115
00:07:41,646 --> 00:07:43,846
Well...

116
00:07:43,846 --> 00:07:46,646
The reason why I did the hammering

117
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:49,746
was because it was written on the script.

118
00:07:49,746 --> 00:07:52,946
Hey, hey. Wise up, Pops.

119
00:07:52,946 --> 00:07:55,946
That's why we've been telling you to at least read the script.

120
00:07:55,946 --> 00:07:57,346
But...

121
00:07:58,682 --> 00:08:01,982
Dad, Mr. Yamazaki took photos of Ms. Yoko without permission

122
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,382
and left a bad impression on you,

123
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:06,582
so you jumped into conclusions, didn't you?

124
00:08:06,582 --> 00:08:10,782
Nonsense! I'm not as narrow-minded as you may think.

125
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,682
That man is definitely hiding something from us.

126
00:08:13,682 --> 00:08:15,982
I have no doubt about it.

127
00:08:15,982 --> 00:08:19,082
I shouldn't be surprised that Pops noticed it, too.

128
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,582
What are you doing?

129
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:22,682
At any rate, we should be able to find out

130
00:08:22,682 --> 00:08:24,582
once we see the content of that case!

131
00:08:25,682 --> 00:08:27,082
Mr. Yamazaki.

132
00:08:27,082 --> 00:08:28,382
I'm sorry to ask this,

133
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:31,482
but could you let us take a look inside your case as a precaution?

134
00:08:31,482 --> 00:08:33,782
That... But...

135
00:08:42,282 --> 00:08:44,082
Understood.

136
00:08:49,182 --> 00:08:51,882
That's my...

137
00:08:52,882 --> 00:08:54,182
Mr. Yamazaki.

138
00:08:54,182 --> 00:08:57,382
Would you care to explain what this is about?

139
00:08:57,382 --> 00:09:01,182
I'm sorry. My impulses got the best of me.

140
00:09:01,182 --> 00:09:03,782
As Mr. Mouri said, I was indeed furious

141
00:09:03,782 --> 00:09:07,382
because my cell phone was snapped into pieces.

142
00:09:07,382 --> 00:09:08,782
As a grown man,

143
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:11,582
it's insolent of you to take peeping photos of an idol.

144
00:09:11,582 --> 00:09:12,882
You should be ashamed.

145
00:09:12,882 --> 00:09:16,682
But still, you didn't have to break it!

146
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:20,382
Screw it! I'm going home!

147
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:23,582
Wait! Please hold on.

148
00:09:23,582 --> 00:09:27,382
After that, I noticed the handkerchief Yoko was using

149
00:09:27,382 --> 00:09:29,882
fell onto the chair.

150
00:09:29,882 --> 00:09:32,382
So I thought if I auctioned off the handkerchief and a photo of Yoko

151
00:09:32,382 --> 00:09:35,382
as a set over the internet,

152
00:09:35,382 --> 00:09:38,282
I could maybe sell it to the fans for a high price.

153
00:09:38,282 --> 00:09:41,082
Bastard! Stop screwing around like that!

154
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:44,182
Hold it, dad! Calm down!

155
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:46,882
But wasn't the photo in question unusable

156
00:09:46,882 --> 00:09:50,682
since it was destroyed by Mr. Kimijima along with the cell phone?

157
00:09:50,682 --> 00:09:55,682
I bet he set it so that photos will be saved in a memory card.

158
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:57,582
By doing that, his photos will remain intact

159
00:09:57,582 --> 00:10:00,082
even if the cell phone is not.

160
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:01,482
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:01,482 --> 00:10:02,782
You've caused another problem.

162
00:10:02,782 --> 00:10:06,082
But for now, we need to focus on Mr. Kimijima's vase.

163
00:10:06,082 --> 00:10:08,982
Where on earth did it vanish to?

164
00:10:10,982 --> 00:10:14,182
Mr. Honma, where are you going?

165
00:10:14,182 --> 00:10:16,282
"Kentaro Honma (70)" -What's the matter, Mr. Honma?

166
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,082
"Antique Appraiser" -Why are you asking me that?

167
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:20,382
If problems keep surfacing like that,

168
00:10:20,382 --> 00:10:22,882
the filming for today will be called off, right?

169
00:10:22,882 --> 00:10:25,982
No, we haven't decided on doing that just yet.

170
00:10:25,982 --> 00:10:30,182
I have a busy schedule. Please do excuse me.

171
00:10:30,182 --> 00:10:33,482
Please wait, Mr. Honma.

172
00:10:33,482 --> 00:10:36,582
My apologies, but before you leave,

173
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:40,082
would you mind showing us the contents of that large baggage?

174
00:10:40,082 --> 00:10:43,382
Mr. Honma! Are you the culprit?

175
00:10:43,382 --> 00:10:46,382
How will you explain this, Mr. Honma?

176
00:11:01,229 --> 00:11:05,629
Mr. Honma! You were pretty intrigued by that vase.

177
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:08,829
Remarkable...

178
00:11:10,229 --> 00:11:12,429
Where did you get this?

179
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:14,529
Well, well, Mr. Honma.

180
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:17,329
I can see that it caught your eye.

181
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:20,229
Also, during the puffed grain candy machine demonstration...

182
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:30,529
Mr. Honma, where are you going?

183
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:32,829
I'm not interested in that.

184
00:11:34,229 --> 00:11:36,829
Didn't you leave the set all by yourself?

185
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:40,729
Are you saying I'm the culprit just because of that?

186
00:11:40,729 --> 00:11:42,829
I merely think that it's possible

187
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:47,629
to conceal a vase in a baggage like that.

188
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:49,129
I see.

189
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:56,329
Are you satisfied now?

190
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:59,829
It isn't there. My vase isn't there!

191
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:02,429
I apologize for doubting you.

192
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:05,129
No, it's true that if one carries such a large baggage

193
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:08,629
out of the studio, suspicion will surely ensue.

194
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:10,629
Please don't worry about it.

195
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,129
Now, please excuse me.

196
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:14,729
Please hold on, Mr. Honma.

197
00:12:14,729 --> 00:12:16,529
What else do you want?

198
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:20,329
It's not like we have decided to terminate our filming.

199
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:23,529
Forget Mr. Yamazaki's second period lecture for a moment.

200
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:26,429
As for your third period lecture, Mr. Honma,

201
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:28,529
we will still continue filming as planned

202
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:31,029
if we recover Mr. Kimijima's lost vase.

203
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:34,629
As such, may I ask you not to go home just yet?

204
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,129
Even if you do manage to find the vase,

205
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:39,429
I doubt you'll be able to continue filming.

206
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:42,029
-Pardon? -Oh, no.

207
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:43,729
It was nothing.

208
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:46,629
They won't be able to film even if the vase is found?

209
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:48,729
What does that mean?

210
00:12:48,729 --> 00:12:51,829
Does he know something else?

211
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:53,029
Mr. Kamisuwa.

212
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:56,629
Even if you say so, we're already fairly behind schedule.

213
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:59,429
Enough is enough!

214
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:02,429
Hey! The culprit is among us, isn't it?

215
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:05,929
In that case, show yourself and return my vase at once!

216
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:08,529
Please calm down, Mr. Kimijima.

217
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:10,629
Besides Mr. Yamazaki and Mr. Honma,

218
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:13,829
nobody in this studio has personal belongings

219
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:17,129
large enough to conceal your vase.

220
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,129
Then, where on earth is my vase?

221
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:23,729
It's true that no one carried a container out of the studio

222
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:26,629
that's big enough to conceal the vase.

223
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:29,229
Having said that, we did search everywhere in the studio

224
00:13:29,229 --> 00:13:31,529
but failed to locate the vase.

225
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:35,829
But of course, it couldn't have vanished just like that.

226
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:38,329
I'm sure I've missed something.

227
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:39,729
What could it be?

228
00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:42,529
We can't help it.

229
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:44,729
Let's call it a day and stop our filming.

230
00:13:44,729 --> 00:13:45,929
Okay.

231
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:47,529
Apologies!

232
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:49,829
As for today's filming, we'll call it a day here.

233
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,729
The art staff members, please disassemble the set!

234
00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:55,729
Dissemble the set?

235
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:58,029
Hashimoto, lend me your cutter.

236
00:13:58,029 --> 00:13:59,329
Sure.

237
00:14:02,229 --> 00:14:05,529
I see! So that's how it was!

238
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:12,329
Dad, isn't it about time you got sleepy?

239
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:14,529
We still haven't located the vase.

240
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:18,629
Getting sleepy is not something...

241
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:21,329
I should do or I shouldn't...

242
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:24,529
Monkey see, monkey do...

243
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:27,629
Hold on for a moment.

244
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:30,029
The first thing we need to deal with is not the set,

245
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:32,129
but the case.

246
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:34,729
Then, do you know who the culprit is?

247
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:37,129
Yeah. The whereabout of the vase, too.

248
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:38,629
Are you sure?

249
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:42,229
So this is the Sleeping Kogoro's famous deduction.

250
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:45,029
We shall see its true worth with our very own eyes.

251
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:49,029
The culprit still has the vase.

252
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:51,129
The culprit still has it?

253
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:52,829
Still has it?

254
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:56,229
But everyone here is empty-handed, dad.

255
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,829
Look closely, Ran.

256
00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:02,329
Among us, two people are wearing waist bags.

257
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:11,829
When the staff said they were disassembling the set earlier,

258
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:15,829
I confirmed the contents of Assistant Director Hashimoto's bag.

259
00:15:17,229 --> 00:15:19,529
Please check it however you want.

260
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:21,529
I only put these things inside it.

261
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:24,729
In that case, Ms. Shinobu Oki,

262
00:15:24,729 --> 00:15:26,829
-you're the one... -Hold it right there!

263
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:28,729
What on earth are you saying?

264
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:30,729
That vase from the Qing Dynasty

265
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,529
could never fit into such a small waist bag!

266
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:36,629
Right, of course. However,

267
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:41,629
it's more than possible if one shatters the vase.

268
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:44,829
What did you say? The vase was...

269
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:47,129
shattered?

270
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:50,329
That Qing vase valued at 100 million yen?

271
00:15:56,229 --> 00:15:58,029
Ms. Shinobu.

272
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:00,929
But if the vase was shattered,

273
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:03,429
wouldn't everyone immediately notice the sound?

274
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,229
Nobody was able to notice that.

275
00:16:06,229 --> 00:16:09,029
Everyone, please recall what happened

276
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:10,729
during the rehearsal for the second period lecture.

277
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:16,229
When all of us were focusing on the puffed grain candy machine,

278
00:16:16,229 --> 00:16:19,429
you secretly went through the back of the set

279
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:21,629
and put the vase in a bag you prepared beforehand

280
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:24,929
so that the shards wouldn't scatter.

281
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:29,329
Then, Ms. Yoko used the hammer to hit the machine.

282
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:31,129
With that timing...

283
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:35,029
All right, here we go!

284
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:41,129
You shattered the vase from outside the bag.

285
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:45,929
Finally, you stuffed your waist pouch with a bagful of vase shards.

286
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:49,829
And you reappeared at the scene like nothing happened.

287
00:16:50,729 --> 00:16:52,029
I see.

288
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:53,929
She took advantage of the loud noise from the puffed grain candy machine

289
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,229
to cover the sound of the shattering vase.

290
00:16:56,229 --> 00:16:58,129
Is that true?

291
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:12,329
Why... Why did you do that?

292
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:13,829
Why?

293
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:16,829
Answer me!

294
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:19,629
That's it! You!

295
00:17:19,629 --> 00:17:22,729
You were always yelling at her like that.

296
00:17:22,729 --> 00:17:26,429
I bet she hated you for that, Mr. Kimijima.

297
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:28,629
Is that right?

298
00:17:28,629 --> 00:17:30,529
But...

299
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:32,629
whatever hatred she might have had...

300
00:17:32,629 --> 00:17:34,729
I still can't believe someone in their right mind

301
00:17:34,729 --> 00:17:37,329
would smash a 100-million-yen vase.

302
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:41,129
It just goes to show how much she despises him!

303
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:50,929
Still, I have one more thing I'd like to ask Mr. Honma.

304
00:17:52,129 --> 00:17:56,629
It is about the appraisal result of that vase.

305
00:17:56,629 --> 00:17:58,829
You want me to reveal that now?

306
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:00,329
Yes.

307
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,729
But it doesn't seem like she wishes for that.

308
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:05,129
That's true.

309
00:18:05,129 --> 00:18:09,129
But if this keeps up, Ms. Shinobu will be viewed as a bad person.

310
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,829
Isn't that her choice as well?

311
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:13,329
I know that.

312
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:15,329
However,

313
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:17,829
there is always only one truth.

314
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:23,329
Even if it may go against Ms. Shinobu's will.

315
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:24,829
Very well.

316
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:30,429
On the subject of the Qing vase in Mr. Noburo Kimijima's possession...

317
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:36,529
I deem it a remarkable counterfeit.

318
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:39,329
That... That can't be.

319
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:41,229
That can't be true!

320
00:18:42,629 --> 00:18:45,429
That vase was a counterfeit?

321
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:47,629
-No way. -It can't be.

322
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,329
Then, earlier today...

323
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:57,229
It's this one.

324
00:18:57,229 --> 00:19:00,929
What do you think? It's quite a work of art, right?

325
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:04,329
This is... Excuse me for a second.

326
00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:10,029
Remarkable...

327
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:13,229
You meant to say it was a remarkable counterfeit?

328
00:19:13,229 --> 00:19:15,229
That's correct.

329
00:19:17,229 --> 00:19:20,429
As expected, you have seen through its fakery.

330
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:23,229
If I were to declare it a fake during filming,

331
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:26,429
Mr. Kimijima would lose face as a result.

332
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:30,029
At the same time, I cannot lie about my appraisal results.

333
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:33,029
Troubled by this, I...

334
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:37,029
tried to leave the set without a word before filming, but failed.

335
00:19:38,129 --> 00:19:41,329
I'm afraid she had the same feeling.

336
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:42,529
Ms. Shinobu.

337
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:46,229
Knowing how deeply Mr. Kimijima values his vase,

338
00:19:46,229 --> 00:19:48,829
you couldn't bring yourself to let out the truth.

339
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:52,229
Then comes the invitation to be on the show.

340
00:19:52,229 --> 00:19:54,629
If the appraisal were to take place on the show,

341
00:19:54,629 --> 00:19:57,329
it would be revealed that it is a fake.

342
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:00,129
Since you didn't break the news up to this point,

343
00:20:00,129 --> 00:20:03,929
your master was about to lose face on national television.

344
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:05,729
Worrying yourself over this,

345
00:20:05,729 --> 00:20:08,029
you decided to make it look like a vase theft

346
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:10,729
to halt the filming, didn't you?

347
00:20:10,729 --> 00:20:13,629
Yes. It's exactly as you said.

348
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,429
Shinobu, when did you find out

349
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:19,429
that the vase was a counterfeit?

350
00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:22,929
A year ago, before your wife passed away,

351
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:25,129
she called me to her bedside.

352
00:20:26,229 --> 00:20:28,229
Although that vase is a fake,

353
00:20:28,229 --> 00:20:31,729
it's still an irreplaceable treasure to you.

354
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:35,529
So she told me to keep you from finding out at all costs.

355
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:38,229
But since I couldn't keep the promise,

356
00:20:38,229 --> 00:20:39,729
and things turned out like this,

357
00:20:39,729 --> 00:20:43,329
I am unable to remain by your side, Master Kimijima.

358
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:46,729
With this, I will hang up my hat,

359
00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:48,729
give up on my singer dream and go home.

360
00:20:48,729 --> 00:20:52,329
Thank you very much for all these years!

361
00:20:52,329 --> 00:20:56,829
Shinobu, do not embarrass me any further.

362
00:20:56,829 --> 00:21:00,629
It's true that my eye for vases is gullible.

363
00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:06,029
However, I believe my discerning eye for singers is unclouded!

364
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:09,529
Earlier, I received a call along with a reply.

365
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:12,529
Your debut has been approved!

366
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:17,029
Since the producer was rather indecisive,

367
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:20,029
I went ahead and gave him an earful.

368
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:23,029
Don't make me repeat myself!

369
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:26,629
I said there's nothing to worry about, didn't I?

370
00:21:26,629 --> 00:21:27,829
Nonsense!

371
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:30,629
Are you saying you can't trust my judgment?

372
00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:33,229
Shinobu Oki is a true talent!

373
00:21:33,229 --> 00:21:35,329
You have my assurance on that!

374
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:39,429
Do you still plan to go home despite all this?

375
00:21:42,129 --> 00:21:45,529
Thank you very much. Thank you very much!

376
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:47,529
Congratulations, Ms. Shinobu!

377
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:49,629
Congratulations!

378
00:21:54,829 --> 00:21:57,229
"THE MOST USEFUL SCHOOL IN THE WORLD"

379
00:23:22,229 --> 00:23:25,129
Looks like I've somehow solved another case, but...

380
00:23:25,129 --> 00:23:27,829
It's no good, I can't remember anything.

381
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:29,829
Mr. Mouri!

382
00:23:30,729 --> 00:23:33,829
I forgot to mention, but your necktie...

383
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,129
So you've indeed noticed it?

384
00:23:36,129 --> 00:23:38,629
I wore this just to attract your attention, Yoko!

385
00:23:38,629 --> 00:23:41,529
It got stained by the gravy from your lunch box!

386
00:23:45,229 --> 00:23:47,129
Have a nice day!

387
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:54,429
I'm gravely in shock.

388
00:23:54,429 --> 00:23:58,929
Even a necktie can't save him from embarrassment.

389
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,860
