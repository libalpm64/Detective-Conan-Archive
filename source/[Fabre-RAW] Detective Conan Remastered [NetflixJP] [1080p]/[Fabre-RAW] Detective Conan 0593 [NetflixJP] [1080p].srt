1
00:00:02,296 --> 00:00:05,696
We've come to visit the Tori no Ichi at the Ranburi Shrine.

2
00:00:05,696 --> 00:00:07,496
Ran and Sonoko wanted to come

3
00:00:07,496 --> 00:00:13,196
to choose an oracle that tells fortunes of love, called the Lovely Oracle.

4
00:00:13,196 --> 00:00:15,596
However, the Lovely Oracle

5
00:00:15,596 --> 00:00:17,996
was not the only thing that appeared at Tori no Ichi.

6
00:00:17,996 --> 00:00:19,296
A purse snatcher wearing a funny face mask,

7
00:00:19,296 --> 00:00:21,396
called the Rooster Man also appeared.

8
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,796
Sonoko's bag is also snatched away by this culprit.

9
00:00:24,796 --> 00:00:29,296
We visited the Ranburi Shrine again during San no Tori.

10
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:31,296
But, there again, Rooster Man appears,

11
00:00:31,296 --> 00:00:34,896
stabs a university student named Mr. Shiro Masuko and wounds him.

12
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:38,017
Just before passing out,

13
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:40,019
Mr. Masuko says, "It's not a rooster, but a monkey"

14
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:42,896
and used fingers of both his hands to indicate the number 9.

15
00:00:42,896 --> 00:00:46,025
What on earth does this mean?

16
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:49,596
There were three men in the toilet

17
00:00:49,596 --> 00:00:52,031
that Rooster Man locked himself up in.

18
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:53,296
Mr. Tatsuo Hino,

19
00:00:53,296 --> 00:00:54,896
Mr. Hisami Sarukawa,

20
00:00:54,896 --> 00:00:56,996
or Mr. Shinji Mizunoe?

21
00:00:56,996 --> 00:00:59,796
Is Rooster Man among the three men?

22
00:01:01,296 --> 00:01:03,696
We find out that the button that is found in Ran's coin purse

23
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:06,045
may be something that Rooster Man had dropped

24
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:08,396
when he bumped into Ran at the previous Tori no Ichi.

25
00:01:08,396 --> 00:01:12,051
So, the houses of the three men were investigated.

26
00:01:13,596 --> 00:01:15,796
But it looks like this case

27
00:01:15,796 --> 00:01:18,796
is not going to be solved as easily it was first thought to be.

28
00:01:38,077 --> 00:01:39,596
Brooding over passing seasons

29
00:01:39,596 --> 00:01:41,696
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

30
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:43,296
A mysterious shadow closes in on Ran.

31
00:01:43,296 --> 00:01:46,096
The 9 monkeys and Rooster Man mystery is finally solved.

32
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:47,496
He sees through the one and only truth.

33
00:01:47,496 --> 00:01:49,296
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

34
00:01:49,296 --> 00:01:51,396
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

35
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:19,945
"The Tori's Pledge of Monkey and Rake (Part 2)"

36
00:03:23,645 --> 00:03:26,185
What? You couldn't find it?

37
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:27,345
You mean you couldn't find the clothes

38
00:03:27,345 --> 00:03:29,945
that the button came off from in the houses of the three?

39
00:03:29,945 --> 00:03:31,945
No. Although it seems they just took a quick look

40
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,545
because no search warrant was issued.

41
00:03:34,545 --> 00:03:35,845
It seems that there were no clothes

42
00:03:35,845 --> 00:03:38,197
with the same type of button on them either.

43
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:41,645
We asked the family members of the three too,

44
00:03:41,645 --> 00:03:44,845
but it seems that there were no clothes that suddenly disappeared either.

45
00:03:44,845 --> 00:03:45,945
It's highly unlikely that the button

46
00:03:45,945 --> 00:03:48,845
was disposed of after the crime either then.

47
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:52,211
Yes. So maybe the button that Ran picked up

48
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:54,213
was something that just happened to be there.

49
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:56,845
Oh. Is that so?

50
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:59,745
By the way, we asked the family members

51
00:03:59,745 --> 00:04:02,221
and found that on the day of Ichi no Tori,

52
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:04,745
Mr. Hino was on a trip to Sendai with his family.

53
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,645
Mr. Sarukawa has an alibi during Ichi no Tori and Ni no Tori,

54
00:04:07,645 --> 00:04:09,845
both at the time the crime was committed.

55
00:04:09,845 --> 00:04:12,245
Mr. Mizunoe seems to have been

56
00:04:12,245 --> 00:04:15,445
on a business trip to Nagasaki on the day of Ni no Tori.

57
00:04:15,445 --> 00:04:18,245
In addition, at Ichi no Tori when he was attacked by Rooster Man,

58
00:04:18,245 --> 00:04:20,745
he seems to have filed a complaint at the police.

59
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:21,945
I see.

60
00:04:21,945 --> 00:04:23,745
Which means that be it at Ichi no Tori,

61
00:04:23,745 --> 00:04:26,845
Ni no Tori or San no tori, none of the men

62
00:04:26,845 --> 00:04:29,945
among the three could've committed the crime.

63
00:04:29,945 --> 00:04:33,845
By the way, we got a call from the hospital just a while ago

64
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:37,345
saying that Mr. Shiro Masuko had regained consciousness.

65
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:41,045
-And? -It seems that he's saying that he has no recollection

66
00:04:41,045 --> 00:04:42,645
of being stabbed by Rooster Man

67
00:04:42,645 --> 00:04:44,845
or having said anything about a monkey or the number 9.

68
00:04:44,845 --> 00:04:47,145
I see.

69
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:50,269
He doesn't remember? What does that mean?

70
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:53,045
Inspector! I found it!

71
00:04:53,045 --> 00:04:54,845
Mr. Mizunoe's bank account

72
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:56,275
was found inside Rooster Man's knapsack!

73
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:57,845
You found it?

74
00:04:57,845 --> 00:05:01,945
Yes! That bank book was in somebody else's bag,

75
00:05:01,945 --> 00:05:03,845
so it took a while for us to confirm it.

76
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,145
Somebody else's bag?

77
00:05:05,145 --> 00:05:08,287
Yes. We had the people who were attacked

78
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:11,945
at Ichi no Tori and Ni no Tori confirm whether it was their bags or not.

79
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,293
But since the contents were all out of sorts.

80
00:05:14,545 --> 00:05:15,945
Come to think of it,

81
00:05:15,945 --> 00:05:19,045
there was a handkerchief that I never saw inside my bag too.

82
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:21,945
The oracle that I'm sure I put inside the bag was gone too.

83
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:24,845
You're referring to that thing called the Lovely Oracle, aren't you?

84
00:05:24,845 --> 00:05:26,305
I saw it in another bag.

85
00:05:26,545 --> 00:05:30,309
Something about a nervous and old fashioned boyfriend.

86
00:05:30,545 --> 00:05:34,313
Hey, you don't have to go revealing the contents!

87
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:37,445
Nervous and old fashioned type?

88
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:40,745
But I wonder why the contents were all messed up.

89
00:05:40,745 --> 00:05:44,323
I'm sure Rooster Man took the contents of the bags

90
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:47,345
that he stole out and put them back again randomly.

91
00:05:47,345 --> 00:05:50,745
And? Did the victims of Ichi no Tori and Ni no Tori

92
00:05:50,745 --> 00:05:53,945
confirm that it was their bags that was stolen by Rooster Man?

93
00:05:53,945 --> 00:05:56,335
Yes, so there's no doubt

94
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:59,445
that the culprit of all three cases is the same person.

95
00:05:59,445 --> 00:06:01,345
So, now everything is clear, isn't it?

96
00:06:01,345 --> 00:06:02,341
Yeah.

97
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:06,345
It means that there's a liar among the onlookers here

98
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:08,945
passing around rumors that Rooster Man ran into the toilet.

99
00:06:08,945 --> 00:06:10,845
True.

100
00:06:10,845 --> 00:06:14,845
Because there seems to be no one

101
00:06:14,845 --> 00:06:19,145
among us who could've visited all three festivals.

102
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,145
Okay then, I guess we get to go.

103
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:22,361
It's okay, isn't it?

104
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:24,745
I'm sure my wife is worried to so.

105
00:06:24,745 --> 00:06:27,745
Yes. I guess so, for today.

106
00:06:29,145 --> 00:06:31,445
Move.

107
00:06:31,445 --> 00:06:33,145
Move it, I said!

108
00:06:33,145 --> 00:06:34,645
Strange.

109
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,375
I guess the contents of the bags that were stolen

110
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,377
being all messed up isn't much of a problem,

111
00:06:38,545 --> 00:06:42,381
but why was he carrying something like that around?

112
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:43,745
If he were caught with it,

113
00:06:43,745 --> 00:06:44,845
he wouldn't be able to get away with it,

114
00:06:44,845 --> 00:06:46,945
since it would serve as proof against him.

115
00:06:46,945 --> 00:06:48,145
The reactions of the three

116
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:50,389
when Ran said that she had found the button

117
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:53,045
that may belong to Rooster Man also bother me.

118
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,345
If Rooster Man was among them,

119
00:06:55,345 --> 00:06:57,245
even if the button didn't come off,

120
00:06:57,245 --> 00:06:58,397
just the thought that it may have,

121
00:06:58,397 --> 00:07:00,845
should've thrown him into panic.

122
00:07:00,845 --> 00:07:03,745
It normally would make him cold sweat and panic.

123
00:07:07,045 --> 00:07:11,145
I see. He ran and perspired,

124
00:07:11,145 --> 00:07:13,345
so that he could distract everyone from the fact

125
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:15,045
that he was perspiring from panic.

126
00:07:15,045 --> 00:07:18,417
Wait a sec. Even if he were the culprit,

127
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:22,421
he couldn't have gone to all three festivals that were held?

128
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:24,423
If so, there has to be somebody

129
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:27,745
other than him who is Rooster Man,

130
00:07:28,945 --> 00:07:30,429
but the knapsack had things

131
00:07:30,645 --> 00:07:33,545
that were stolen from all three festivals inside it.

132
00:07:33,545 --> 00:07:37,145
Besides, what does monkey and the number 9 mean?

133
00:07:37,145 --> 00:07:39,545
What on earth does it mean?

134
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:43,445
What's the matter, Conan? Why that dreadfully serious look?

135
00:07:43,445 --> 00:07:47,445
Yep. I was just wondering what monkey and the number 9 mean.

136
00:07:47,445 --> 00:07:49,845
Monkey and 9 (Saru and Kyu).

137
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,451
Dad, what brings you here?

138
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:54,145
I heard that Rooster Man appeared again

139
00:07:54,145 --> 00:07:56,745
and that you guys came to,

140
00:07:56,745 --> 00:07:59,445
so I got worried and came to pick you up.

141
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,445
It was big news on TV

142
00:08:01,445 --> 00:08:02,745
that the guy who was stabbed

143
00:08:02,745 --> 00:08:06,465
left a mysterious message of monkey and the number 9 behind.

144
00:08:07,645 --> 00:08:10,745
What the word "kyu" brings to mind for me is...

145
00:08:10,745 --> 00:08:14,473
kyukancho (myna bird), kyukyusha (ambulance),

146
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:18,145
takkyu (table tennis) or yakyu (baseball)!

147
00:08:18,145 --> 00:08:23,045
But, I don't recall any baseball ground with the word Saru in it.

148
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:27,745
Talking of baseball grounds, the Koshien Kyujo,

149
00:08:27,745 --> 00:08:30,245
what is it called Koshien (monkey-child-park)?

150
00:08:30,245 --> 00:08:33,145
Was there a place called Koshien in that area?

151
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:36,045
Yes, there is! Like Koshien Station.

152
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:37,245
No.

153
00:08:37,245 --> 00:08:38,945
The name of the place was named what it is now,

154
00:08:38,945 --> 00:08:41,145
after the Koshien Baseball Park was made there.

155
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:44,045
And the year the Koshien Baseball Park was built is...

156
00:08:45,245 --> 00:08:48,245
What about the year it was built?

157
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:50,845
I see. So, that's what it was...

158
00:08:50,845 --> 00:08:53,845
The victim knew the culprit.

159
00:08:53,845 --> 00:08:55,945
That's why he referred to the 9th monkey.

160
00:08:56,945 --> 00:08:59,145
Okay, let's go home!

161
00:09:00,145 --> 00:09:02,521
Oh, I forgot!

162
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:05,845
I've got to go pick up my laundry at the cleaners before I go home.

163
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,845
Dad, will you go on ahead and take Conan and Sonoko home!

164
00:09:09,845 --> 00:09:11,945
You can go pick it up tomorrow!

165
00:09:11,945 --> 00:09:15,645
You're attending a friend's wedding tomorrow, aren't you, Dad?

166
00:09:34,945 --> 00:09:38,557
Where's the cleaners?

167
00:09:44,945 --> 00:09:48,145
Hey, ole man, you bump into us,

168
00:09:48,145 --> 00:09:49,545
and think you can get away just walking off like that?

169
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:51,845
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:51,845 --> 00:09:55,045
If you really feel bad about it, give us your wallet.

171
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:56,575
What?

172
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:58,577
Don't worry!

173
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:01,045
All we're taking from you is enough to go drinking!

174
00:10:01,045 --> 00:10:03,945
If you mug him, I'm calling the police!

175
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:08,587
Hey lady, you're punky, aren't you?

176
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:10,345
You're pretty cute too.

177
00:10:10,345 --> 00:10:12,591
You wanna come play with us?

178
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:15,730
Those punks.

179
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,245
In order to capture that heart of a nervous and old-fashioned type like him,

180
00:10:19,245 --> 00:10:22,245
it's best to be a Japanese woman with all the traditional graces.

181
00:10:22,245 --> 00:10:25,845
Tomboys and girls that prefer flashy fashion are a no-no!

182
00:10:25,845 --> 00:10:29,045
Stay graceful and refined.

183
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:33,845
It will surely bring you closer together.

184
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:36,945
I'm just saying that committing a crime is not good.

185
00:10:38,045 --> 00:10:39,345
What's with her?

186
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:42,345
What is it? What's going on? Is it a fight?

187
00:10:42,345 --> 00:10:45,545
-Hey, let's get out of here -Yeah.

188
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:46,945
Take care!

189
00:10:52,245 --> 00:10:55,245
Thank you! You're a lifesaver!

190
00:10:55,245 --> 00:10:57,045
Not at all.

191
00:10:57,045 --> 00:10:59,545
Acting like a tomboy is a no, no!

192
00:10:59,545 --> 00:11:01,945
I've got to stay gracefully refined.

193
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:08,345
What? You've found out who Rooster Man is?

194
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:11,145
Which means, you've figured out the meaning of the word monkey

195
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:14,145
and number 9 that the university student who was stabbed remarked of?

196
00:11:14,145 --> 00:11:16,655
Yep. The man who was stabbed

197
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:19,445
knew the man who stabbed him!

198
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:22,661
That's why he said, "He's not a rooster, but a monkey",

199
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:24,663
and showed nine of his fingers.

200
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:26,245
Then, it's that man

201
00:11:26,245 --> 00:11:27,945
that has a monkey looking face called Tatsuo Hino, right?

202
00:11:27,945 --> 00:11:29,245
If they knew each other,

203
00:11:29,245 --> 00:11:30,345
he would know the face of the one who stabbed him, wouldn't he?

204
00:11:30,345 --> 00:11:33,645
But, he has nothing to do with the number 9, does he?

205
00:11:33,645 --> 00:11:36,675
Then, is it the man called Hisami Sarukawa?

206
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:38,945
His nickname seems to be Kyu-chan too.

207
00:11:38,945 --> 00:11:41,445
Besides if he was close enough to know the nickname of the culprit.

208
00:11:41,445 --> 00:11:42,681
I'm sure he would've mentioned the nickname

209
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:45,745
and directly say that the culprit is Sarukawa.

210
00:11:45,745 --> 00:11:49,945
But the only one left is Shinji Mizunoe then?

211
00:11:49,945 --> 00:11:52,691
What's monkey and number 9 about him?

212
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:55,545
The character "tori" that is used for Tori no Ichi refers to the "tori"

213
00:11:55,545 --> 00:11:57,445
as know in the twelve horary signs of the lunar calendar, right?

214
00:11:57,445 --> 00:11:58,697
So what about the monkey character?

215
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:01,145
Well...

216
00:12:01,145 --> 00:12:03,645
The character "shin" is the character

217
00:12:03,645 --> 00:12:05,845
used in the name of Shinji Mizunoe.

218
00:12:05,845 --> 00:12:08,707
But, what about the number 9?

219
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:12,711
I just talked about the Koshien Baseball grounds just now, didn't I?

220
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:15,445
It was named "Koshien" because it was built

221
00:12:15,445 --> 00:12:18,717
in 1924, the year of the monkey,

222
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:21,245
the animal sign that indicates that year.

223
00:12:21,245 --> 00:12:23,245
The year of the monkey?

224
00:12:23,245 --> 00:12:25,545
The sexagenary cycle!

225
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:29,745
Ko, Otsu, Hei, Tei, Bo, Ki, Ko, Shin,

226
00:12:29,745 --> 00:12:32,145
Jin, Ki, the 10 celestial stems.

227
00:12:32,145 --> 00:12:34,733
And the twelve branches, Shi, Chu, In, Bo, Shin,

228
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:40,245
Shi, Go, Bi, Shin, Yu, Jutsu, and Gai combined,

229
00:12:40,245 --> 00:12:44,545
make up the sexagenary cycle that makes one round every 60 years.

230
00:12:44,545 --> 00:12:46,545
Therefore, the word "koshi"

231
00:12:46,545 --> 00:12:48,747
is the celestial stem "ko" and "shi" of the branch combined,

232
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:52,545
so it is the first year of the 60 year cycle!

233
00:12:52,545 --> 00:12:54,745
That's why the baseball stadium was named Koshien,

234
00:12:54,745 --> 00:12:56,755
because it was built that year.

235
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:59,445
Then what is the 9th year?

236
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,645
The 9th is

237
00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:04,245
Koshi, Otchu, Heiin,

238
00:13:04,245 --> 00:13:08,345
Teibo, Boshin, Kishi, Kogo, Shinbi, and

239
00:13:08,345 --> 00:13:09,745
Jinshin.

240
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:12,045
You mean like in the Jinshin War!

241
00:13:12,045 --> 00:13:15,645
You can say it in other Japanese reading form, too, can't you?

242
00:13:15,645 --> 00:13:17,845
Like in "Hinoeuma".

243
00:13:17,845 --> 00:13:21,745
The other way of reading for Jinshin is...

244
00:13:21,745 --> 00:13:23,545
Mizunoe, saru...

245
00:13:23,545 --> 00:13:26,345
Mizunoe? Shinji Mizunoe!

246
00:13:26,345 --> 00:13:28,045
It's literally what it is!

247
00:13:28,045 --> 00:13:31,045
As proof of that, the man called Mizunoe,

248
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:33,145
attempted to show us the receipt he received

249
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,793
at the convenience store, but didn't, right?

250
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:38,445
That's because when he was fleeing disguised as Rooster Man,

251
00:13:38,445 --> 00:13:42,545
the receipt that was in the pocket of his pants got wet from perspiration!

252
00:13:42,545 --> 00:13:44,545
And if he shows a wet receipt,

253
00:13:44,545 --> 00:13:47,245
the fact that he ran would be disclosed!

254
00:13:47,245 --> 00:13:49,445
The only things that were disposed of in the tool closet

255
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:52,245
in the restroom that Rooster Man took flight into

256
00:13:52,245 --> 00:13:53,745
were the murder weapon knife,

257
00:13:53,745 --> 00:13:57,445
a down jacket and the mask of a funny face!

258
00:13:57,445 --> 00:13:58,817
I see.

259
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:01,545
He had everything ready beforehand, except for his pants,

260
00:14:01,545 --> 00:14:03,945
which he didn't have any change for.

261
00:14:03,945 --> 00:14:05,145
But, wait!

262
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:09,145
Didn't Officer Takagi say that Mizunoe was on a business trip

263
00:14:09,145 --> 00:14:10,829
and didn't go to the Ni no Tori?

264
00:14:11,045 --> 00:14:14,445
Besides, his bag was stolen by Rooster Man at Ichi no Tori

265
00:14:14,445 --> 00:14:15,945
and he even filed a complaint

266
00:14:15,945 --> 00:14:18,145
for stolen items at the police too, right?

267
00:14:18,145 --> 00:14:19,545
That's right.

268
00:14:19,545 --> 00:14:22,545
Because the Rooster Man who stabbed Mr. Masuko today

269
00:14:22,545 --> 00:14:24,843
at San no Tori was that man called Mizunoe,

270
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:27,345
but Rooster Man who appeared at Ichi no Tori and Ni no Tori

271
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:29,545
was Mr. Masuko!

272
00:14:30,545 --> 00:14:34,853
It's most likely that Mr. Masuko was threatening Mr. Mizunoe

273
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:36,245
because of the bank book

274
00:14:36,245 --> 00:14:38,857
that was in the bag that Mr. Masuko stole from him.

275
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,445
He was probably threatened because of dirty money or embezzlement.

276
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:45,145
Masuko most likely demanded cash to keep his mouth shut.

277
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:46,865
You're saying that Mr. Masuko

278
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:48,245
deliberately put all the things he stole

279
00:14:48,245 --> 00:14:50,445
at Ichi no Tori and Ni no Tori in the knapsack

280
00:14:50,445 --> 00:14:51,845
and brought it along with him?

281
00:14:51,845 --> 00:14:54,873
Yeah. Mizunoe probably told him

282
00:14:55,045 --> 00:14:58,345
to bring the bank book as well as everything

283
00:14:58,345 --> 00:15:02,145
that he had stolen up to now

284
00:15:02,145 --> 00:15:04,445
when coming to make the deal!

285
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,345
He then stabbed Mr. Masuko who came along,

286
00:15:07,345 --> 00:15:08,887
left the stolen items behind

287
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:11,845
and disguise himself as Rooster Man, then fled.

288
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:13,745
Since he has an alibi when it comes to Ni no Tori,

289
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:15,345
he wouldn't be suspected.

290
00:15:15,345 --> 00:15:18,145
I see! Since Mr. Masuko who was stabbed back then,

291
00:15:18,145 --> 00:15:20,899
was aiming to be a literature major,

292
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,145
and all that was written on the bank book

293
00:15:22,145 --> 00:15:23,545
were the name and address of the culprit,

294
00:15:23,545 --> 00:15:26,445
the word monkey and the number 9 crossed his mind!

295
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:28,245
So, maybe he said that

296
00:15:28,245 --> 00:15:29,445
he didn't remember anything

297
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:32,345
after regaining consciousness at the hospital because...

298
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:34,345
When he was stabbed, he was probably so vexed

299
00:15:34,345 --> 00:15:38,245
that he left behind the word monkey and number 9 that indicated the culprit.

300
00:15:38,245 --> 00:15:41,345
But, after calming down and thinking it over,

301
00:15:41,345 --> 00:15:43,745
he realized that if people found out what he meant,

302
00:15:43,745 --> 00:15:46,245
it would reveal that he is in fact Rooster Man.

303
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,927
So he decided to not say anything.

304
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:51,545
But there's no proof.

305
00:15:51,545 --> 00:15:53,645
It would be great is somebody would pick up the things

306
00:15:53,645 --> 00:15:56,935
that Rooster Man dropped.

307
00:15:57,145 --> 00:15:59,945
Right! The button that Ran picked up at Ni no Tori

308
00:15:59,945 --> 00:16:02,145
after Rooster Man bumped into her!

309
00:16:02,145 --> 00:16:05,645
If clothes missing that button is found in Mr. Masuko's house,

310
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:08,645
then it would serve as proof, right?

311
00:16:08,645 --> 00:16:11,645
Because Rooster Man that appeared at Ni no Tori is Mr. Masuko.

312
00:16:11,645 --> 00:16:14,445
Well, if the guy Masuko confesses

313
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:16,245
and spits it out about Mizunoe,

314
00:16:16,245 --> 00:16:17,745
then the case will be closed.

315
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:21,545
You're both great with deduction!

316
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:24,545
Just as would be expected of the Deduction Queen and Sleeping Kogoro!

317
00:16:24,545 --> 00:16:25,945
Oh, well...

318
00:16:25,945 --> 00:16:28,045
Piece of cake!

319
00:16:28,045 --> 00:16:29,945
But somehow...

320
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:32,145
It does feel like something's not right.

321
00:16:32,145 --> 00:16:33,945
At any rate, let's tell Officer Takagi

322
00:16:33,945 --> 00:16:35,245
and the others about the button

323
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,975
and have them check on it!

324
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:39,345
On whether or not clothes missing that button

325
00:16:39,345 --> 00:16:41,645
is in Mr. Masuko's house!

326
00:16:55,345 --> 00:16:58,997
Maybe I sent a little too much out to the cleaners.

327
00:17:09,932 --> 00:17:13,732
What? You gave the button back to Ran?

328
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,032
Why? It's evidence, isn't it?

329
00:17:16,032 --> 00:17:20,732
Oh, no. Back then, it wasn't determined as evidence yet.

330
00:17:20,732 --> 00:17:23,432
And she said that it could have fallen off her father's clothes,

331
00:17:23,432 --> 00:17:26,132
so that she wanted to take it home and check on it.

332
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:29,027
Hey, you'd better be sure that the guy called Mizunoe

333
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:32,832
is not going to attack Ran because he wants to get rid of the button.

334
00:17:32,832 --> 00:17:35,032
Ran will be okay!

335
00:17:35,032 --> 00:17:37,035
She's strong.

336
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:38,832
Something's wrong.

337
00:17:38,832 --> 00:17:40,832
Ran's not answering the phone since a while ago.

338
00:17:40,832 --> 00:17:43,432
-What? -What?

339
00:17:51,832 --> 00:17:54,732
Wallet...

340
00:17:54,732 --> 00:17:57,632
There... Here it is.

341
00:18:00,432 --> 00:18:02,832
So long as I get rid of the button,

342
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,063
there's no danger of me being suspected anymore.

343
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:07,932
Mr. Mizunoe?

344
00:18:07,932 --> 00:18:09,532
Is it you?

345
00:18:09,532 --> 00:18:11,932
Oh, that button!

346
00:18:11,932 --> 00:18:13,932
Yeah, that's right.

347
00:18:13,932 --> 00:18:17,432
This is from the guy I failed to kill today.

348
00:18:17,432 --> 00:18:20,332
The button that belongs to Rooster Man.

349
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,332
Rooster Man that you failed to kill.

350
00:18:22,332 --> 00:18:25,083
Wasn't that man stabbed by Rooster Man?

351
00:18:25,332 --> 00:18:29,532
That's why I'm telling you that university student was Rooster Man!

352
00:18:29,532 --> 00:18:31,089
What?

353
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:35,632
That punk. He saw the bank book that he stole from me

354
00:18:35,632 --> 00:18:39,732
and realized that I'm embezzling money from my company.

355
00:18:39,732 --> 00:18:42,532
Well, it's strange that nobody

356
00:18:42,532 --> 00:18:45,103
noticed that the same amount of money

357
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:47,832
was being deposited to my account every month

358
00:18:47,832 --> 00:18:52,232
that belonged to a company that doesn't even exist.

359
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:56,132
That guy had the nerve to say

360
00:18:56,132 --> 00:18:57,732
that he'd give me back my bank book

361
00:18:57,732 --> 00:19:00,232
but he didn't know which bag was mine.

362
00:19:00,232 --> 00:19:02,332
That's why I told him

363
00:19:02,332 --> 00:19:06,232
to bring everything he stole up to now so I can check for myself.

364
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:10,132
That's why I disguised myself as Rooster Man just today.

365
00:19:10,132 --> 00:19:12,432
Too bad, it seems that he made it through.

366
00:19:12,432 --> 00:19:14,932
But, I don't think he'll talk,

367
00:19:14,932 --> 00:19:17,632
because he's a chicken that was saying

368
00:19:17,632 --> 00:19:21,139
that he stole to relieve the stress of having to study for his exam.

369
00:19:23,532 --> 00:19:25,432
Don't you think it's strange?

370
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,332
Why do you think I'm talking my head off like this?

371
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:37,832
Miss, it's because you're going to have to die.

372
00:19:40,332 --> 00:19:42,432
Right here and now.

373
00:19:45,432 --> 00:19:48,932
Ran...

374
00:19:50,432 --> 00:19:53,171
I think you should turn yourself in.

375
00:19:54,132 --> 00:19:57,175
Nobody's dead yet.

376
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:59,832
But, if you keep on adding to your crime...

377
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:04,132
Begging for your life? Yeah, I guess you don't want to die.

378
00:20:04,132 --> 00:20:07,632
You probably haven't fell in and out of love much yet.

379
00:20:07,632 --> 00:20:13,191
And, I found a Lovely fortune oracle still sealed in your wallet too.

380
00:20:13,432 --> 00:20:15,832
Still sealed?

381
00:20:15,832 --> 00:20:17,932
Don't tell me that Sonoko...

382
00:20:17,932 --> 00:20:20,332
She snatched the Lovely Fortune oracle from me back then

383
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:22,932
and feigned reading it,

384
00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:26,532
but maybe she read her own oracle and not mine.

385
00:20:26,532 --> 00:20:31,209
I guess I'll read it for you as a gift to you before you go to Hades.

386
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:38,032
In order to grab the heart of an intelligent boy like him,

387
00:20:38,032 --> 00:20:41,232
it's best to be yourself.

388
00:20:41,232 --> 00:20:43,232
Beware because he'll see right through you

389
00:20:43,232 --> 00:20:46,632
if you try to adorn yourself or act like a cutie-pie!

390
00:20:46,632 --> 00:20:49,932
Go through with the natural openness that you possess.

391
00:20:49,932 --> 00:20:53,732
Believe in yourself and push on forward,

392
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:58,132
then your feelings for him will surely reach him.

393
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,237
So it says!

394
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,732
Ran...

395
00:22:57,355 --> 00:22:59,932
We didn't have to worry after all.

396
00:22:59,932 --> 00:23:03,361
What was that flashy technique you just struck?

397
00:23:03,361 --> 00:23:05,632
Torso spin kick!

398
00:23:05,632 --> 00:23:08,832
Kazumi, my senior taught it to me the other day!

399
00:23:08,832 --> 00:23:11,369
Oh, I see.

400
00:23:11,532 --> 00:23:14,232
Oh, he's the real culprit and...

401
00:23:14,232 --> 00:23:16,432
Yes, we know!

402
00:23:16,432 --> 00:23:20,332
But, Ran! Wasn't tomboyish actions a no, no?

403
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,732
That's what your oracle said, right?

404
00:23:22,732 --> 00:23:24,632
Mine said...

405
00:23:26,032 --> 00:23:30,032
In order to grab the heart of an intelligent boy like him,

406
00:23:30,032 --> 00:23:32,232
it's best to be yourself.

407
00:23:32,232 --> 00:23:33,732
Beware because he'll see right through you

408
00:23:33,732 --> 00:23:36,432
if you try to adorn yourself or act like a cutie-pie!

409
00:23:36,432 --> 00:23:39,397
Go through with the natural openness that you possess.

410
00:23:39,397 --> 00:23:42,732
Believe in yourself and push on forward,

411
00:23:42,732 --> 00:23:45,403
then your feelings for him will surely reach him!

412
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,405
I like this!

413
00:23:47,405 --> 00:23:49,407
Change it with mine, will you!

414
00:23:49,407 --> 00:23:50,832
No way!

415
00:23:50,832 --> 00:23:55,132
Well, I guess it just goes to show that women have to be strong!

416
00:23:56,432 --> 00:23:59,432
You're too strong.

417
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,680
Next Conan's Hint:

418
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,020
"Fire"

419
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,960
The next episode is about a mystery tour to Hiroshima.

420
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,427
It's snacks with beer!

421
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:10,760
I thought so.
