1
00:00:02,322 --> 00:00:05,985
The Black Organization that shrunk my body.

2
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:07,722
After repeated attempts to grasp a chance

3
00:00:07,722 --> 00:00:10,422
to disclose their identity,

4
00:00:10,422 --> 00:00:13,993
the FBI ends up on my side pursuing the same goal.

5
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:17,997
The Organization is trying to recover their member, Rena Mizunashi.

6
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:21,522
They sprung a clever trap.

7
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,422
The fake image of Rena Mizunashi

8
00:00:23,422 --> 00:00:26,722
that the Organization aired on TV.

9
00:00:26,722 --> 00:00:31,322
As a result, the FBI revealed her hospital room.

10
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:34,013
Now that we know, we'd better get out of here fast.

11
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:35,322
We will take the last resort

12
00:00:35,322 --> 00:00:37,222
that we talked of this morning.

13
00:00:37,222 --> 00:00:39,122
We're splitting up in three different cars

14
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,822
and going to confuse the Organization

15
00:00:40,822 --> 00:00:43,222
while we make it out of this hospital.

16
00:00:43,222 --> 00:00:44,822
It just dawned on me

17
00:00:44,822 --> 00:00:46,622
after hearing what the boy had to say.

18
00:00:46,622 --> 00:00:49,322
An excellent plan to deceive them

19
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:53,022
and get Rena Mizunashi out of here.

20
00:00:53,022 --> 00:00:56,035
So, three cars that driven by Camel and two other agents,

21
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:58,037
start off with Rena Mizunashi inside.

22
00:00:58,222 --> 00:01:01,222
It looks as if the plan had succeeded, however...

23
00:01:04,222 --> 00:01:08,047
No, the one that we've gotta go after

24
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:11,222
is the third car that Vodka is pursuing.

25
00:01:11,222 --> 00:01:12,622
Kir is in there.

26
00:01:18,322 --> 00:01:20,522
Huh? Why?

27
00:01:20,522 --> 00:01:24,063
Akai would never goof and overtake us in a single spurt

28
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:26,522
in an attempt to divert our attention

29
00:01:26,522 --> 00:01:28,322
from the car he's guarding.

30
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:31,522
It's a trap that he used to lure us to him.

31
00:01:31,522 --> 00:01:32,522
Trap.

32
00:01:37,422 --> 00:01:38,922
But, boss...

33
00:01:38,922 --> 00:01:42,081
The backseat of the car I'm pursuing is empty,

34
00:01:42,322 --> 00:01:44,922
and there are only two FBI agents sitting in the front.

35
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:49,322
It's true that an FBI agent is driving.

36
00:01:49,322 --> 00:01:52,091
But the one sitting in the passenger's seat is Kir.

37
00:01:55,322 --> 00:01:59,222
They expected us to assume that the unconscious Kir

38
00:01:59,222 --> 00:02:03,322
would placed be on a stretcher in the back of the car.

39
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:06,122
So, they tried to making her hold a communicator

40
00:02:06,122 --> 00:02:10,109
and put her in the passenger's seat to disguise her as an FBI agent.

41
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:14,113
But, wasn't that third car headed for the hospital again?

42
00:02:14,113 --> 00:02:16,422
All the more, it made me come to this conclusion.

43
00:02:16,422 --> 00:02:19,422
Although the FBI knew that we found out where Kir was,

44
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:22,121
they couldn't move her right away

45
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:26,125
because they had nowhere to take her in this situation.

46
00:02:26,322 --> 00:02:28,722
So, they wanted to make it look like they moved her to another hospital

47
00:02:28,722 --> 00:02:30,122
and returned to the same hospital

48
00:02:30,122 --> 00:02:35,222
as if nothing had happened.

49
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:36,422
Because they figured...

50
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:40,422
we would never search that hospital again.

51
00:02:56,155 --> 00:02:57,722
Sizzling hot suspense.

52
00:02:57,722 --> 00:03:00,159
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

53
00:03:00,322 --> 00:03:02,161
It's a sink or swim contest.

54
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:03,822
Kir's secret is revealed.

55
00:03:03,822 --> 00:03:05,322
He sees through the one and only truth.

56
00:03:05,322 --> 00:03:07,122
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

57
00:03:07,122 --> 00:03:09,022
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

58
00:04:37,253 --> 00:04:43,053
"Red and Black Crash: Last Words"

59
00:05:09,353 --> 00:05:13,353
What? A black Chevy and four motorbikes?

60
00:05:13,353 --> 00:05:15,953
Don't tell me they found out?

61
00:05:15,953 --> 00:05:17,753
Most probably yes.

62
00:05:17,753 --> 00:05:19,453
But, I'm sure I can break them away

63
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:22,301
with my driving skills.

64
00:05:47,553 --> 00:05:49,453
Hey, what's up, Camel?

65
00:05:56,753 --> 00:05:59,053
Camel! What's up?

66
00:06:12,153 --> 00:06:14,753
It's hurt.

67
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:18,357
Kir.

68
00:06:21,153 --> 00:06:22,361
What's the meaning of this?

69
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:24,153
What's with the car?

70
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:25,853
I found out that you came to save me

71
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:29,153
through the wireless of the FBI,

72
00:06:29,153 --> 00:06:32,653
so I hit him with the bomb case I was holding

73
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:34,373
and pulled the side brakes.

74
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:37,353
Which means that the FBI hospitalized you

75
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:38,753
but you were conscious?

76
00:06:38,753 --> 00:06:41,753
Yes, I regained consciousness two or three days ago.

77
00:06:41,753 --> 00:06:45,853
Although the FBI seems to have thought I was in a coma all this time.

78
00:06:45,853 --> 00:06:48,953
Well, since we got Kir back

79
00:06:48,953 --> 00:06:50,853
and all shall we split.

80
00:06:50,853 --> 00:06:52,153
Yeah.

81
00:06:52,153 --> 00:06:54,953
After we get rid of this stupid FBI agent

82
00:06:54,953 --> 00:06:57,453
who took on this fat role all alone.

83
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,401
Kill him, Chianti.

84
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:03,453
Okay.

85
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:10,409
If you must blame someone,

86
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:11,853
blame the FBI who thought up such a stupid strategy...

87
00:07:24,853 --> 00:07:26,053
Explosion?

88
00:07:26,053 --> 00:07:28,153
Don't tell me he had the bomb in his pocket

89
00:07:28,153 --> 00:07:29,553
without removing the fuse?

90
00:07:31,553 --> 00:07:34,753
Maybe the fuse coincidentally returned in tact

91
00:07:34,753 --> 00:07:36,435
from the impact of the crash.

92
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:42,441
Huh, an accident?

93
00:07:42,653 --> 00:07:44,443
Oh my.

94
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:46,445
Oh no. Gotta call an ambulance!

95
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:49,153
The mob...

96
00:07:49,153 --> 00:07:50,449
Kir, get inside my car.

97
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:51,553
We're splitting.

98
00:08:13,553 --> 00:08:15,953
Succeeded...

99
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,953
Great, good work.

100
00:08:21,553 --> 00:08:23,653
"Haido Central Hospital" -What?

101
00:08:23,653 --> 00:08:24,853
You deliberately handed Rena Mizunashi

102
00:08:24,853 --> 00:08:26,753
over to the Organization?

103
00:08:26,753 --> 00:08:29,253
Yeah, that's why I told Camel

104
00:08:29,253 --> 00:08:32,491
to boast about his driving technique.

105
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:36,495
So that he would be chosen as the driver of the car

106
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:38,853
that would help Rena Mizunashi escape from this hospital.

107
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:41,653
Then we made the Organization pick out the car

108
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:43,953
and made them get her back.

109
00:08:43,953 --> 00:08:47,653
We made them think that they outfoxed us

110
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:50,509
after figuring out what our plan was.

111
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:51,453
I thought it out together with this boy here,

112
00:08:51,453 --> 00:08:53,853
after racking out brains.

113
00:08:53,853 --> 00:08:55,353
Then, what?

114
00:08:55,353 --> 00:08:58,517
-Gorilla? -You mean this gorilla hitting me...

115
00:08:58,753 --> 00:09:00,519
was also part of the plan?

116
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:03,653
Yeah, I ordered him to silence anyone

117
00:09:03,653 --> 00:09:06,953
who would get in the way of this plan.

118
00:09:06,953 --> 00:09:11,053
Besides, this time we were fortunately able to make them think

119
00:09:11,053 --> 00:09:14,053
the driver died because of their bomb.

120
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,553
At that time...

121
00:09:18,253 --> 00:09:20,153
He had the car drift

122
00:09:20,153 --> 00:09:22,541
in order to face the driver's seat towards the guardrail,

123
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,543
and stop the car at the best position possible for the door

124
00:09:24,753 --> 00:09:27,353
to be for escaping.

125
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:30,549
Moreover, he had to match the timing of explosion

126
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:31,953
and escape at the right time.

127
00:09:31,953 --> 00:09:34,553
Otherwise, he had no chance of succeeding.

128
00:09:37,553 --> 00:09:39,353
I couldn't possibly have made you

129
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:41,953
who have no driving technique to do the job, right?

130
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:48,567
But, Rena Mizunashi was the only line connecting them to us.

131
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:52,353
Why did you hand her over to them just like that?

132
00:09:52,353 --> 00:09:55,753
I made a contract with her last night.

133
00:09:55,753 --> 00:09:57,453
I asked her to become not a plain line

134
00:09:57,453 --> 00:10:00,953
but a fishing line for us the FBI.

135
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,585
I was maneuvered into doing so by this boy.

136
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:12,853
Oh... you never fail to surprise me, sonny.

137
00:10:12,853 --> 00:10:15,553
I'm glad you're on our side, Mr. Akai.

138
00:10:15,553 --> 00:10:17,053
Same here, sonny.

139
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:23,053
It's time you get some rest.

140
00:10:23,053 --> 00:10:24,053
We've got a long night ahead of us.

141
00:10:24,053 --> 00:10:25,653
Yes, sir.

142
00:10:37,953 --> 00:10:40,619
And? What do you say, Mr. Akai?

143
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:44,623
Do you want to try this sink or swim plan?

144
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:46,253
Of course.

145
00:10:46,253 --> 00:10:47,853
First, please bring the Prince

146
00:10:47,853 --> 00:10:50,353
that will be waking Sleeping Beauty here.

147
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,153
Mr. Akai, emergency conference.

148
00:10:59,553 --> 00:11:00,653
A strategy meeting?

149
00:11:00,653 --> 00:11:01,653
Yes.

150
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,053
I sure hope they have a great plan.

151
00:11:19,853 --> 00:11:22,661
Hey, wake up, Rena Mizunashi.

152
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:24,663
If you don't get up,

153
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:28,053
I can't ask you how Hidemi is right now.

154
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:29,553
Hey, wake up!

155
00:11:29,553 --> 00:11:30,669
Wake up, please!

156
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:33,853
They're going to take you some place again, aren't they?

157
00:11:33,853 --> 00:11:36,453
Before that happens, open your eyes!

158
00:11:36,453 --> 00:11:39,753
Hey, I'm telling you! Open your eyes!

159
00:11:43,553 --> 00:11:44,683
No, Ei-chan.

160
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:46,353
I told you, didn't I?

161
00:11:46,353 --> 00:11:49,253
That you should never become a person who hurt other people.

162
00:11:49,253 --> 00:11:51,253
Big sis?

163
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:54,153
Yes, right, Ei-chan.

164
00:11:54,153 --> 00:11:55,853
So, don't ask any questions now

165
00:11:55,853 --> 00:11:58,253
and just get out of this dangerous place.

166
00:11:58,253 --> 00:11:59,753
Please.

167
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:02,701
No! You have type AB blood!

168
00:12:02,953 --> 00:12:05,253
If you're big sis who gave me blood,

169
00:12:05,253 --> 00:12:06,705
you should have type O blood!

170
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:08,453
Because I am her younger brother

171
00:12:08,453 --> 00:12:11,953
who can only receive blood from others with type O!

172
00:12:11,953 --> 00:12:14,713
Your blood changed to type AB

173
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:16,715
during the bone-marrow transplant

174
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:18,153
for treatment of leukemia.

175
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:21,053
Your older sister's bone-marrow was used for the transplant

176
00:12:21,053 --> 00:12:22,353
was the H.L.A.

177
00:12:22,353 --> 00:12:24,453
In other words, the bone-marrow of siblings

178
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:28,353
often have a higher matching rate of human leukocyte antigen.

179
00:12:28,353 --> 00:12:31,953
At the same time, Eisuke's type O blood that was infected with leukemia

180
00:12:31,953 --> 00:12:34,733
was destroyed using X-rays.

181
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:38,153
They transplanted bone-marrow from your sister who has AB blood.

182
00:12:38,153 --> 00:12:41,453
That's why your blood type

183
00:12:41,453 --> 00:12:45,353
changed from O to AB, Eisuke.

184
00:12:45,353 --> 00:12:46,753
I am type AB?

185
00:12:46,753 --> 00:12:49,453
Yep, I'm sure there's no mistake about it.

186
00:12:49,453 --> 00:12:52,153
The nurse who was present during your surgery

187
00:12:52,153 --> 00:12:54,753
told me that you had leukemia.

188
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:57,453
She also told me that the wound on your chest

189
00:12:57,453 --> 00:13:01,253
is the mark left behind because of repeated needles injected there

190
00:13:01,253 --> 00:13:04,763
to examine the condition of the tumor cells within the bone-marrow.

191
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:06,753
But, if so...

192
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,353
Why?

193
00:13:08,353 --> 00:13:10,769
Why didn't you tell me about it?

194
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:12,153
Why did you even change your name

195
00:13:12,153 --> 00:13:13,853
and work as an announcer?

196
00:13:13,853 --> 00:13:15,553
Ei-chan.

197
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:17,953
Sis!

198
00:13:17,953 --> 00:13:20,153
It can't be helped.

199
00:13:20,153 --> 00:13:23,353
Because your sister...

200
00:13:23,353 --> 00:13:25,453
is a CIA agent.

201
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:41,431
CIA?

202
00:13:41,431 --> 00:13:42,801
What're you talking about?

203
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:45,131
Why would you be doing something like that?

204
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:46,805
Not only your older sister,

205
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:48,807
but your father was one too.

206
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:50,131
Father too?

207
00:13:50,131 --> 00:13:51,131
Yeah.

208
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:54,813
They snuck into a certain Organization to make investigations.

209
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:59,131
And, she was forced to become an announcer to suit their needs.

210
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:01,231
She pretended to be someone else,

211
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:02,821
and deliberately didn't explain anything to you

212
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:04,831
to keep you from coming to see her after seeing her on TV.

213
00:14:04,831 --> 00:14:08,831
I guess that's what it was.

214
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:10,829
Well, it turned out the way she didn't expect

215
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:13,331
because you came to see her anyway.

216
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,531
Hey, hold it. I can't make it out.

217
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:20,531
What on earth is that certain Organization anyway?

218
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:22,331
Enough.

219
00:14:22,331 --> 00:14:24,831
That's as far as you need to know.

220
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:28,847
Camel, do your thing.

221
00:14:29,031 --> 00:14:31,531
-Yes, sir. -Huh? Hey...

222
00:14:31,531 --> 00:14:33,831
I'm still not finished!

223
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:37,731
By the way, I think the strategy meeting is about to start.

224
00:14:37,731 --> 00:14:40,859
Lock that boy inside a vacant room and go on ahead.

225
00:14:41,031 --> 00:14:43,331
I'll be right over when I'm finished here.

226
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:46,331
Just do as I asked you to over the phone.

227
00:14:46,331 --> 00:14:47,931
Roger.

228
00:14:47,931 --> 00:14:51,231
So, do you know me?

229
00:14:51,231 --> 00:14:53,331
Yes, I do,

230
00:14:53,331 --> 00:14:54,873
Shuichi Akai.

231
00:14:54,873 --> 00:14:58,031
The FBI agent that the Organization fears the most.

232
00:14:58,031 --> 00:14:59,731
Okay, then I guess it won't take much time,

233
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:02,881
then I'll get right to the point.

234
00:15:02,881 --> 00:15:04,883
Before that tell me,

235
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:08,887
how did you know that I was a CIA agent?

236
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:12,331
First, the method of detecting lies that you tried on me at the park

237
00:15:12,331 --> 00:15:15,431
when you were interviewing Mr. Domon.

238
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:17,931
Don't tell me you followed me here?

239
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:19,531
Nope, I just happened to come here.

240
00:15:19,531 --> 00:15:20,899
It's just a coincidence.

241
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,901
You tried to check whether I was lying

242
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:24,903
by checking my pulse,

243
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:26,905
steadiness of breathing and whether my pupils were dilated.

244
00:15:27,131 --> 00:15:29,931
These are methods that the CIA usually use.

245
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:31,331
And later...

246
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:34,913
Thank you, you're a life-saver.

247
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:38,917
Thank you so very much.

248
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:41,331
You knowing that I was lying to you

249
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:43,431
about being there coincidentally,

250
00:15:43,431 --> 00:15:45,431
but thanked me anyway, right?

251
00:15:45,431 --> 00:15:46,431
You were actually saying,

252
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,927
thanks to you, I didn't end up killing Mr. Domon, right?

253
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:53,431
And besides, the words you mumbled before Gin and the others.

254
00:15:53,431 --> 00:15:57,331
Our achievements never see the light.

255
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,631
But when we fail, everything is disclosed.

256
00:16:00,631 --> 00:16:04,031
That's a CIA cliche, right?

257
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:07,931
Well, it seems that Bellmot sort of knew already.

258
00:16:07,931 --> 00:16:10,431
Don't tell me you're...

259
00:16:10,431 --> 00:16:12,531
like this?

260
00:16:12,531 --> 00:16:16,331
That knocking was a play on words Vermouth

261
00:16:16,331 --> 00:16:19,331
used for non official cover or NOC, wasn't it?

262
00:16:19,331 --> 00:16:22,231
She wanted to ask if you were a CIA agent.

263
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,731
Actually back then a communicator and wiretap

264
00:16:24,731 --> 00:16:27,431
was on the sole of your shoe.

265
00:16:27,431 --> 00:16:28,531
It coincidentally happened to be there,

266
00:16:28,531 --> 00:16:31,331
the one that you used trying to catch the prankster

267
00:16:31,331 --> 00:16:32,431
who rung your doorbell and fled.

268
00:16:33,731 --> 00:16:36,231
Oh I see.

269
00:16:36,231 --> 00:16:38,431
But, how did you find out about father?

270
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:40,979
Since we already knew his name was Hondo,

271
00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:43,331
it was simple.

272
00:16:43,331 --> 00:16:44,631
Besides, this boy had already informed us

273
00:16:44,631 --> 00:16:48,031
that he maybe a member of what was called the Company too.

274
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:52,631
But, you didn't think I could do it, did you?

275
00:16:52,631 --> 00:16:54,431
That I could kill...

276
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,431
You own father, you mean?

277
00:16:56,431 --> 00:16:57,631
Huh?

278
00:16:57,631 --> 00:17:01,631
He bit his own wrist and shot himself under the chin.

279
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:05,431
Rather, he made it look that way, is more correct.

280
00:17:05,431 --> 00:17:09,631
Your father, Ethern Hondo did so to protect his daughter.

281
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:13,631
He also prepared an MD that had a recording of him questioning you.

282
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:15,013
He made it just in case,

283
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:18,631
under the assumption that they found out you were a CIA agent.

284
00:17:18,631 --> 00:17:20,031
Isn't that right?

285
00:17:20,031 --> 00:17:23,331
Yes. It was all father's idea.

286
00:17:23,331 --> 00:17:26,231
I was so involved in melting in with the Organization

287
00:17:26,231 --> 00:17:27,931
that I couldn't handle anything more than that.

288
00:17:27,931 --> 00:17:29,027
At the same time,

289
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:31,631
I wasn't planning to stay that long in the Organization.

290
00:17:31,631 --> 00:17:34,531
Yes, my mission as a CIA agent

291
00:17:34,531 --> 00:17:36,331
was to find a new person to act as connection

292
00:17:36,331 --> 00:17:38,231
for my father who snuck into the Organization,

293
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:40,231
and introduce him to them.

294
00:17:40,231 --> 00:17:41,931
The former person was killed

295
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:44,431
and all contacts were severed.

296
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:45,731
After all was done,

297
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,331
I was supposed to look like I died

298
00:17:48,331 --> 00:17:51,331
and leave the Organization.

299
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:52,531
But...

300
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,631
He's the new connection.

301
00:17:56,631 --> 00:17:59,331
Barney. You know him, don't you?

302
00:17:59,331 --> 00:18:01,059
He'll be here soon.

303
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:04,631
Okay. You haven't been followed, have you?

304
00:18:04,631 --> 00:18:07,931
No, I was taping a TV program,

305
00:18:07,931 --> 00:18:09,831
but I said that I'd go to take a quick nap for about an hour

306
00:18:09,831 --> 00:18:13,631
because I wasn't feeling well.

307
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,031
Since this place is near the station

308
00:18:16,031 --> 00:18:18,331
as well as the next transaction site of the Organization,

309
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,531
I figured it was my chance to see you

310
00:18:20,531 --> 00:18:22,831
since I heard you were coming.

311
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:24,331
Did you change your clothes?

312
00:18:24,331 --> 00:18:27,085
No, I didn't.

313
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:28,331
Don't move.

314
00:18:28,331 --> 00:18:30,731
Come on, father, nothing's on me.

315
00:18:30,731 --> 00:18:31,931
Look.

316
00:18:31,931 --> 00:18:33,931
It's a communicator.

317
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:37,731
I never had anything like that put on me before.

318
00:18:37,731 --> 00:18:39,931
It's a specially developed item

319
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:42,531
and will vanish in 24 hours.

320
00:18:42,531 --> 00:18:45,103
It's a bell that they use on newcomers to watch them.

321
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:53,111
That's a Porsche.

322
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:55,113
It's Gin.

323
00:18:57,431 --> 00:18:59,117
Father.

324
00:18:59,331 --> 00:19:01,531
Just what're you...

325
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:05,131
Endure it, this is the only way out.

326
00:19:11,831 --> 00:19:14,231
You...

327
00:19:14,231 --> 00:19:15,931
Listen, this is the story.

328
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:20,231
You found me who was acting suspicious,

329
00:19:20,231 --> 00:19:22,131
so you pursued me and cornered me.

330
00:19:22,131 --> 00:19:25,731
But, you were caught by me instead and interrogated.

331
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,145
And you bit my wrist,

332
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:30,331
took my gun and blew my head off.

333
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:31,831
If you shoot from under my chin,

334
00:19:31,831 --> 00:19:34,831
the blood in my mouth won't be suspected.

335
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:37,155
In case for times like this,

336
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:40,331
I have an MD of me questioning you

337
00:19:40,331 --> 00:19:42,931
in the chest pocket of my jacket.

338
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:47,431
All you have to do is say I didn't say anything.

339
00:19:47,431 --> 00:19:48,831
And this is...

340
00:19:48,831 --> 00:19:50,231
a truth serum.

341
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:52,131
I'll inject a little in you,

342
00:19:52,131 --> 00:19:53,931
so they believe you.

343
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:56,531
I don't want you to go confessing everything, you see.

344
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:00,331
Don't give up, Hidemi.

345
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:02,031
If you keep waiting,

346
00:20:02,031 --> 00:20:03,831
people on your side will surely appear.

347
00:20:04,831 --> 00:20:07,185
Fulfill the mission for me!

348
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:14,831
Soon later Gin and Vodka came along.

349
00:20:14,831 --> 00:20:16,931
I told them what father told me to say,

350
00:20:16,931 --> 00:20:19,731
so I wasn't killed.

351
00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:22,931
Barney who came later saw them

352
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:25,831
and killed himself on the spot.

353
00:20:25,831 --> 00:20:27,931
Then, you wanted Pops...

354
00:20:27,931 --> 00:20:30,331
to look for the prankster that kept ringing your doorbell,

355
00:20:30,331 --> 00:20:32,831
because you wanted to find a new person to act as connector?

356
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:37,931
No, I just wanted to know how to contact the renown detective.

357
00:20:37,931 --> 00:20:41,219
I wanted to ask him to guard Eisuke.

358
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:43,831
He kept calling the station repeatedly

359
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:47,225
that I thought he'd end up coming to see me one day.

360
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:50,731
Of course, I wrote him an honest mail,

361
00:20:50,731 --> 00:20:52,431
telling him that approaching me

362
00:20:52,431 --> 00:20:55,531
would mean getting involved with a dangerous organization.

363
00:20:55,531 --> 00:20:59,631
I wasn't sure if he was going to believe me though.

364
00:20:59,631 --> 00:21:03,241
But, maybe I should've wrote to you instead?

365
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:06,831
You knew that I had regained consciousness, didn't you?

366
00:21:06,831 --> 00:21:09,831
Yep. Remember the time I came back to this room

367
00:21:09,831 --> 00:21:12,431
saying that I forgot something?

368
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:18,031
I realized back then.

369
00:21:18,031 --> 00:21:19,631
Because the wrinkles of the sheets around your neck

370
00:21:19,631 --> 00:21:23,931
were slightly moved from when I first left the room.

371
00:21:23,931 --> 00:21:26,131
By the way, I also knew that Eisuke

372
00:21:26,131 --> 00:21:29,831
was hiding some place in this hospital.

373
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:33,531
His classmate Nakamichi

374
00:21:33,531 --> 00:21:35,631
just happened to be hospitalized here.

375
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:38,631
Because when I asked him if he saw Eisuke, he said no.

376
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:41,931
No, I didn't see Hondo,

377
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:44,431
but if it's a member of my soccer club Eisuke Aizawa,

378
00:21:44,431 --> 00:21:47,285
he came to see me right away.

379
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:50,331
With only that much information, how?

380
00:21:50,331 --> 00:21:53,291
Because all I said was Eisuke

381
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,931
and he knew that it was Eisuke Hondo that I was looking for

382
00:21:54,931 --> 00:21:57,295
and not Eisuke Aizawa.

383
00:21:57,531 --> 00:22:01,299
So I could tell that Nakamichi knew but was hiding it from me.

384
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:03,301
That's how I knew for sure

385
00:22:03,301 --> 00:22:08,131
that he was letting Eisuke hide in his room.

386
00:22:08,131 --> 00:22:11,309
You sure are really something.

387
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:16,131
Yeah, he's awesome to the point of amazing even the FBI.

388
00:22:16,131 --> 00:22:18,031
And what do you plan to do?

389
00:22:18,031 --> 00:22:20,831
The Organization is coming to get me back, aren't they?

390
00:22:20,831 --> 00:22:23,731
Yeah, this is what I propose.

391
00:22:25,731 --> 00:22:27,731
I hope you're not going to tell me

392
00:22:27,731 --> 00:22:31,731
to go back to that Organization again?

393
00:22:31,731 --> 00:22:33,131
Of course.

394
00:22:33,131 --> 00:22:36,231
That's exactly what I want you to do.

395
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

396
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,252
Foreign talents.

397
00:24:06,252 --> 00:24:07,866
This is the 500th episode that has been aired.

398
00:24:07,866 --> 00:24:09,148
Thank you, everybody.

399
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:10,940
This is no more than a point of transit, though.
