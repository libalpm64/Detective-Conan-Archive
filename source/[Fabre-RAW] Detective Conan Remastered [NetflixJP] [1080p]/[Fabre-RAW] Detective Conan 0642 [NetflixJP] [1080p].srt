1
00:00:20,202 --> 00:00:21,802
If all cases were men,

2
00:00:21,802 --> 00:00:23,802
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

3
00:00:23,802 --> 00:00:25,302
The cry of a boy who cries wolf.

4
00:00:25,302 --> 00:00:27,202
The code-like secret of karuta cards.

5
00:00:27,202 --> 00:00:28,802
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:28,802 --> 00:00:30,502
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:30,502 --> 00:00:32,802
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:58,097 --> 00:02:03,178
"Grabbing Karuta Cards in Dire Straits (Part 1)"

9
00:02:03,178 --> 00:02:05,478
"Mouri Detective Agency"

10
00:02:07,178 --> 00:02:10,109
Conan, don't.

11
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,278
Don't move.

12
00:02:20,678 --> 00:02:22,121
Wait.

13
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:24,778
It's all right.

14
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,478
Just stay still.

15
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:44,143
It sure feels like a fever.

16
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:47,278
Did you catch a cold? Your face is all red too.

17
00:02:47,278 --> 00:02:51,878
No, my face is red for a different reason.

18
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:52,978
Wait here.

19
00:02:52,978 --> 00:02:55,878
I'm going to take your temperature with a thermometer.

20
00:02:55,878 --> 00:02:57,278
I'm fine.

21
00:02:57,278 --> 00:03:00,159
It'll completely go away, even if I leave it alone.

22
00:03:01,178 --> 00:03:03,378
See, you're coughing.

23
00:03:03,378 --> 00:03:05,278
It really is a cold.

24
00:03:10,678 --> 00:03:12,678
You hear me?

25
00:03:12,678 --> 00:03:14,878
Stay put until I'm back, okay?

26
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:17,278
Yes.

27
00:03:22,978 --> 00:03:24,183
Are you going somewhere?

28
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:25,678
That's right.

29
00:03:25,678 --> 00:03:28,478
To buy a thermometer since you stepped on it last night

30
00:03:28,478 --> 00:03:30,189
and broke it.

31
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:48,207
Geez, to think I'd catch a cold so early in the year...

32
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:51,578
My precious winter vacation is ruined.

33
00:03:53,178 --> 00:03:54,578
My phone?

34
00:03:58,678 --> 00:04:00,778
"Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya" -It's from Mitsuhiko.

35
00:04:00,778 --> 00:04:04,678
A video call at a time like this?

36
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,778
What's wrong, Conan?

37
00:04:08,778 --> 00:04:10,578
We made plans to meet at Ayumi's place

38
00:04:10,578 --> 00:04:12,878
to play karuta cards, didn't we?

39
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,978
We already ate the mochi.

40
00:04:14,978 --> 00:04:16,235
Are you still sleeping?

41
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,237
A cold, I have a cold.

42
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:20,678
Well, I'm only coughing a little,

43
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:22,778
so it's no big deal.

44
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:25,378
Then, let me see the back of your throat.

45
00:04:25,378 --> 00:04:27,678
I'm going to examine you.

46
00:04:27,678 --> 00:04:28,978
Like this?

47
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:34,278
No way, what's going on there?

48
00:04:34,278 --> 00:04:36,978
The lateral pharyngeal bonds medical to your palatine tonsils

49
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:38,257
are inflamed and swollen?

50
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:40,878
Isn't it an acute upper respiratory tract infection?

51
00:04:40,878 --> 00:04:42,978
What?

52
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:44,263
Idiot.

53
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:45,778
"Acute upper respiratory tract infection"

54
00:04:45,778 --> 00:04:47,178
simply means a cold.

55
00:04:47,178 --> 00:04:48,267
And to begin with,

56
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:50,878
you can't possibly see the back of my throat via a video call.

57
00:04:50,878 --> 00:04:52,078
Bingo.

58
00:04:52,078 --> 00:04:53,978
Well, if it's a cold,

59
00:04:53,978 --> 00:04:56,275
you'd better warm yourself and rest quietly for today.

60
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:58,277
In that case, why not go check on him?

61
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:00,878
-You're right. -Let's go visit.

62
00:05:00,878 --> 00:05:03,278
Hey, you guys can't come.

63
00:05:03,278 --> 00:05:05,378
I might pass it to you.

64
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:12,291
Damn, I really do have a fever.

65
00:05:15,378 --> 00:05:16,978
Looks like someone's here.

66
00:05:20,878 --> 00:05:22,878
Hey, anybody home?

67
00:05:24,678 --> 00:05:27,878
What's wrong?

68
00:05:27,878 --> 00:05:29,478
Bad guys.

69
00:05:29,478 --> 00:05:32,311
Guys I don't know suddenly came to my home.

70
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:35,378
Hey, Masao.

71
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:38,078
If you don't behave, I'm going to get angry.

72
00:05:38,078 --> 00:05:39,678
Excuse us.

73
00:05:39,678 --> 00:05:42,678
My child loves to play pranks just like my husband.

74
00:05:42,678 --> 00:05:44,323
Well, his tendency to over exaggerate

75
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:46,078
comes from his mother.

76
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:47,578
Wrong.

77
00:05:47,578 --> 00:05:49,878
These guys really are people I don't know.

78
00:05:49,878 --> 00:05:51,278
It's not a lie.

79
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,478
We're truly sorry for the intrusion.

80
00:05:56,778 --> 00:05:57,778
Help me!

81
00:05:57,778 --> 00:05:59,278
Cut it out with that "help me".

82
00:05:59,278 --> 00:06:01,878
Saying nonsense like that in front of your parents.

83
00:06:01,878 --> 00:06:04,343
-Let me go! Let me go! -You really are mommy's child,

84
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:06,345
-Let me go! -born from my aching belly.

85
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:09,478
And your slanted eyes came from daddy.

86
00:06:11,178 --> 00:06:13,378
Who was that kid?

87
00:06:13,378 --> 00:06:15,278
Ayumi, do you know him?

88
00:06:15,278 --> 00:06:18,357
I don't, but if their place is on this floor,

89
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:21,978
then I think he's the child of Urafune,

90
00:06:21,978 --> 00:06:24,363
who just moved into Room 2806 recently.

91
00:06:24,578 --> 00:06:29,178
Well then, have you already met his dad and mom?

92
00:06:29,178 --> 00:06:31,978
No, because our rooms are far apart.

93
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:36,378
You only socialize with your close neighbors if you live in a condo.

94
00:06:36,378 --> 00:06:37,778
At any rate,

95
00:06:37,778 --> 00:06:42,381
he sure looks like an infamous little prankster has moved in.

96
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:43,778
No.

97
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,378
Call the police.

98
00:06:46,778 --> 00:06:48,387
I think it's highly possible

99
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:52,391
that he's in some kind of trouble.

100
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:54,393
-What? -Police?

101
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:57,078
How do you know such a thing?

102
00:06:57,078 --> 00:06:58,878
They weren't even blood-related,

103
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:01,278
yet they acted like they were his biological parents.

104
00:07:03,978 --> 00:07:05,378
Well then,

105
00:07:05,378 --> 00:07:08,407
call Officer Takagi and have him come.

106
00:07:09,578 --> 00:07:11,178
Hold it.

107
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:17,878
This is bad.

108
00:07:17,878 --> 00:07:22,421
It sure seems to be a real cold.

109
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,278
Should we call the police?

110
00:07:27,278 --> 00:07:30,429
Let's call, let's call. Conan said so too.

111
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:35,478
But, how did Conan know those guys weren't his parents?

112
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:39,678
Could it be that Conan is an acquaintance of that child?

113
00:07:39,678 --> 00:07:40,878
In that case,

114
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:44,078
he wouldn't refer to him as "the boy just now", would he?

115
00:07:44,078 --> 00:07:45,578
The source of his deduction was the voices

116
00:07:45,578 --> 00:07:49,178
of those three and their conversations.

117
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:51,278
And the footage of those three captured

118
00:07:51,278 --> 00:07:54,453
behind my back by this phone.

119
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:57,878
Can he really be certain that they're not parent and child just that?

120
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,078
He can't, can he?

121
00:08:01,078 --> 00:08:03,678
Perhaps he's talking nonsense

122
00:08:03,678 --> 00:08:05,178
since his cold clouded his judgment.

123
00:08:05,178 --> 00:08:08,178
But Conan is a great detective.

124
00:08:11,678 --> 00:08:12,978
At any rate,

125
00:08:12,978 --> 00:08:15,378
let's go ask the neighbor

126
00:08:15,378 --> 00:08:19,478
about the Urafune family who live in Room 2806.

127
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:23,178
Our call to Officer Takagi can wait until after that.

128
00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:25,478
You're right.

129
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:26,485
Let's do that.

130
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:36,178
What? Urafune, of Room 2806?

131
00:08:36,178 --> 00:08:40,778
So they're my neighbors who just moved in two days ago.

132
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:43,678
But they haven't dropped by to say hi,

133
00:08:43,678 --> 00:08:45,378
so I don't know them well.

134
00:08:45,378 --> 00:08:50,878
I do remember Uemura who lived in Room 2806 before, though.

135
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:52,978
The prior resident?

136
00:08:52,978 --> 00:08:55,578
Yes, it seems he was an employee of Isobe Corporation

137
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:58,078
that was in the news recently.

138
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:01,778
But he said he's moving out because he quit his job

139
00:09:01,778 --> 00:09:04,178
and is going to another company.

140
00:09:04,178 --> 00:09:06,178
Isobe Corporation?

141
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:09,478
The treacherous company that's under suspicion of tax evasion.

142
00:09:09,478 --> 00:09:10,529
By "suspicion",

143
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:13,678
it means they're probably doing something bad, right?

144
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:17,378
So were those people just now really bad guys?

145
00:09:17,378 --> 00:09:20,978
But she was talking about the person who lived there before.

146
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:23,478
It had nothing to do with that Masao just now.

147
00:09:23,478 --> 00:09:25,078
Masao?

148
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:29,578
You mean the boy about your age with slanted eyes and glasses?

149
00:09:29,578 --> 00:09:30,578
Yes.

150
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:32,551
If it's that kid, I know him.

151
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:35,378
So you mean only Masao came by to say hi?

152
00:09:35,378 --> 00:09:37,978
What a courteous child.

153
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:41,478
Courteous? Far from it.

154
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:45,078
Yesterday, when I returned from shopping

155
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:47,578
and was about to ride the elevator,

156
00:09:47,578 --> 00:09:50,178
that child came out and said...

157
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:54,573
Miss, you have so many things.

158
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:57,778
What floor? I'll press it for you.

159
00:09:57,778 --> 00:09:59,978
Twenty-eighth, please.

160
00:09:59,978 --> 00:10:01,278
You're really helpful.

161
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:04,583
If it's the 28th floor, it's the same as my place.

162
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,178
Oh, is that so?

163
00:10:07,178 --> 00:10:10,578
Could it be you're with the family who moved in yesterday?

164
00:10:10,578 --> 00:10:12,378
Yes. I'm Masao Urafune.

165
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,678
Nice to meet you.

166
00:10:14,978 --> 00:10:16,595
Isn't he a great kid?

167
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:21,078
Right. If only the elevator didn't stop at every floor.

168
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,178
What?

169
00:10:22,178 --> 00:10:26,605
I see. He pressed all the floor buttons and fled.

170
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:28,278
Indeed. What's more,

171
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:30,378
he purposely left out the 28th floor.

172
00:10:30,378 --> 00:10:31,878
Really now?

173
00:10:31,878 --> 00:10:35,078
We just saw Masao taken away

174
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:37,978
by people he claimed weren't his parents.

175
00:10:37,978 --> 00:10:41,178
If that kid said they weren't his parents?

176
00:10:41,178 --> 00:10:43,278
They must truly be his parents, no?

177
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:49,378
What?

178
00:10:49,378 --> 00:10:53,478
You want to know about the Urafune's who moved in next door?

179
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:54,978
Beats me...

180
00:10:54,978 --> 00:10:57,978
I'm not the type of person who socializes with neighbors.

181
00:10:57,978 --> 00:11:02,641
Then, did you see anyone weird around the condo?

182
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:05,578
I can't say he's weird,

183
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:09,478
but I saw this Hida guy, a producer at Nichiuri TV.

184
00:11:09,478 --> 00:11:12,978
That guy's on TV sometimes.

185
00:11:12,978 --> 00:11:14,678
Come to think of it,

186
00:11:14,678 --> 00:11:19,278
I did see that producer entering Room 2806.

187
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:22,661
Was this some kind of a case?

188
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:24,078
No way.

189
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:26,078
When did it happen?

190
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:28,667
It was about two weeks ago.

191
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,378
It has nothing to do with Masao,

192
00:11:30,378 --> 00:11:32,678
if it's two weeks ago.

193
00:11:32,678 --> 00:11:36,478
I was pretty intrigued by it,

194
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:40,378
so I asked the boy with slanted eyes

195
00:11:40,378 --> 00:11:43,478
who came out of Room 2806 yesterday around noon.

196
00:11:43,478 --> 00:11:45,278
I asked him,

197
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:47,378
"The producer from Nichiuri TV went to your home the other day,

198
00:11:47,378 --> 00:11:49,878
so what happened?"

199
00:11:49,878 --> 00:11:51,978
Wasn't he Masao?

200
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:54,693
Was the kid wearing glasses?

201
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:56,078
Yes.

202
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:59,278
And, what did the kid say?

203
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:00,978
He said...

204
00:12:00,978 --> 00:12:03,478
It's about a program airing Saturday nights on Nichiuri TV called

205
00:12:03,478 --> 00:12:06,705
"Sudden Visit Dinner Time Next Door".

206
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:09,878
I heard that they're making a sudden visit to your place tonight.

207
00:12:09,878 --> 00:12:11,978
Really now?

208
00:12:11,978 --> 00:12:15,278
That's what he said, so...

209
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:17,578
My wife and I cleaned our place in a big hurry

210
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:19,778
and even prepared a feast,

211
00:12:19,778 --> 00:12:23,078
but no one came no matter how long we waited.

212
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:27,778
We didn't realize the kid was lying

213
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:31,378
until after 8 pm when the live show ended.

214
00:12:31,378 --> 00:12:34,733
I was so embarrassed since I even called my friends

215
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:36,735
to watch me on the show.

216
00:12:38,478 --> 00:12:41,878
So you guys are that kid's friends?

217
00:12:41,878 --> 00:12:44,278
-No. -Just leave already.

218
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:46,745
I won't be fooled again!

219
00:12:49,778 --> 00:12:52,278
-What a wolf crier he was. -Yes.

220
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:55,178
Then, what he said earlier must be a lie too.

221
00:12:57,178 --> 00:12:59,678
Is that so? Understood.

222
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:02,761
Ai, who were you calling?

223
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:04,763
Nichiuri TV.

224
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:08,278
I thought they may have something to do with this.

225
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:10,769
But I couldn't get a hold of that producer.

226
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:14,773
Well, producers at the TV stations are all pretty busy.

227
00:13:14,978 --> 00:13:19,278
No. They said he had a traffic accident two weeks ago,

228
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:21,878
and was unconscious until yesterday.

229
00:13:21,878 --> 00:13:24,278
Traffic accident?

230
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:28,378
Could it be that there's some sort of secret in Room 2806,

231
00:13:28,378 --> 00:13:31,478
and somebody assaulted him because he knew about it?

232
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,278
Under the guise of a traffic accident.

233
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:36,578
Then, maybe Masao also found out about the secret...

234
00:13:36,578 --> 00:13:39,378
But that kid kept crying wolf, didn't he?

235
00:13:39,378 --> 00:13:43,978
However, despise the wolf crier telling the truth in the end,

236
00:13:43,978 --> 00:13:47,678
he was eaten by the wolf because no one believed him, right?

237
00:13:47,678 --> 00:13:49,878
That's true,

238
00:13:49,878 --> 00:13:52,811
but we don't know whether he's telling the truth or not.

239
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:55,778
But Conan told us to call the police.

240
00:13:55,778 --> 00:13:58,178
In that case, we have no other options,

241
00:13:58,178 --> 00:13:59,878
but to confirm it directly.

242
00:13:59,878 --> 00:14:01,778
Directly?

243
00:14:01,778 --> 00:14:07,778
Indeed. By letting ourselves in the Room 2806.

244
00:14:09,378 --> 00:14:12,831
"Urafune"

245
00:14:15,678 --> 00:14:18,837
Oh, shoot. It's the children from before.

246
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:20,839
Why?

247
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:23,678
Because this kid said those things.

248
00:14:23,678 --> 00:14:26,578
It can't be helped, let them in.

249
00:14:29,478 --> 00:14:33,278
In exchange, if you try anything funny...

250
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:37,278
You understand, right?

251
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:44,178
What will happen to your mother?

252
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,736
"Mouri Detective Agency"

253
00:15:01,736 --> 00:15:04,883
37.8 C?

254
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:07,336
Your fever isn't going away.

255
00:15:07,336 --> 00:15:12,236
Idiot, how could a fever go away in a mere hour?

256
00:15:12,236 --> 00:15:14,893
You already gave the brat medicine, so just leave him alone.

257
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:16,895
And fix me some lunch.

258
00:15:18,336 --> 00:15:21,236
Then, Conan, I'll make you some Japanese porridge.

259
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:22,901
Can I ask you something...

260
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:25,436
Did Mitsuhiko or the others call?

261
00:15:25,436 --> 00:15:27,836
No, they didn't.

262
00:15:27,836 --> 00:15:29,436
Did you make plans with them?

263
00:15:29,436 --> 00:15:33,836
I... I made plans to play karuta cards with them.

264
00:15:33,836 --> 00:15:35,936
Well, you'll have to pass that up today.

265
00:15:38,336 --> 00:15:41,336
I'll bring you some delicious porridge right now.

266
00:15:44,636 --> 00:15:46,536
Well, I guess they didn't call back

267
00:15:46,536 --> 00:15:49,636
because they don't want to disturb knowing I have a cold.

268
00:15:49,636 --> 00:15:52,536
And this case can be easily resolved once they call the police.

269
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:54,933
It can't be that they're trying something risky

270
00:15:55,136 --> 00:15:56,935
like entering the place where the weird folks

271
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:59,336
claiming to be his real parents are.

272
00:15:59,336 --> 00:16:01,636
Haibara would never allow it, would she?

273
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:08,436
Maybe no one's home?

274
00:16:08,436 --> 00:16:12,236
Like Conan said, it'd be best if we called Officer Takagi.

275
00:16:12,236 --> 00:16:15,636
But if he's wrong, we're the ones that'll get scolded.

276
00:16:19,536 --> 00:16:22,436
Well, if it isn't the children from earlier.

277
00:16:22,436 --> 00:16:23,836
What's wrong?

278
00:16:23,836 --> 00:16:25,336
Is Masao here?

279
00:16:25,336 --> 00:16:29,636
Could it be that my child...

280
00:16:29,636 --> 00:16:32,636
These guys really are people I don't know.

281
00:16:32,636 --> 00:16:35,736
Said things like that earlier and made you feel uneasy?

282
00:16:37,336 --> 00:16:40,036
Hey, you need to apologize.

283
00:16:40,036 --> 00:16:42,436
These children took you seriously, see?

284
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:47,936
I am sorry for telling a lie.

285
00:16:47,936 --> 00:16:50,989
Well, it seems my child is sorry about lying.

286
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:52,991
Please forgive him.

287
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:01,936
Well, good-bye until next time.

288
00:17:01,936 --> 00:17:03,001
Hold on.

289
00:17:03,936 --> 00:17:07,005
We actually want to play with Masao,

290
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:08,536
do you mind?

291
00:17:08,536 --> 00:17:10,136
I'm sorry.

292
00:17:10,136 --> 00:17:13,011
My child and I will be going out this evening.

293
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:15,036
Then, how about karuta-grabbing?

294
00:17:15,036 --> 00:17:17,036
I happened to bring along karuta cards.

295
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,736
If it's karuta, we can play at home.

296
00:17:19,736 --> 00:17:21,436
Let's play together

297
00:17:21,436 --> 00:17:23,336
until it's time for you to head out.

298
00:17:23,336 --> 00:17:26,036
But, my child is not good at karuta.

299
00:17:26,036 --> 00:17:29,036
I'm... I'm very good at grabbing karuta cards.

300
00:17:29,036 --> 00:17:31,029
I haven't lost to anyone yet!

301
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:32,736
Masao.

302
00:17:35,036 --> 00:17:37,035
Then, if you'll excuse us...

303
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:39,336
Excuse us!

304
00:17:39,336 --> 00:17:42,236
Wait... what are you guys?

305
00:17:44,436 --> 00:17:47,045
Although it's the same condo as my place...

306
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:48,236
It looks like a completely different room

307
00:17:48,236 --> 00:17:50,636
when you have different furniture.

308
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,136
So true.

309
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:54,336
All right.

310
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:57,055
Let's play karuta over there.

311
00:17:57,055 --> 00:18:00,636
Then, please go home after you've played one round.

312
00:18:00,636 --> 00:18:02,636
All right!

313
00:18:02,636 --> 00:18:04,536
Then let's get ready.

314
00:18:04,536 --> 00:18:05,636
Who has the cards?

315
00:18:05,636 --> 00:18:08,136
Ayumi, right?

316
00:18:08,136 --> 00:18:09,067
Here.

317
00:18:09,236 --> 00:18:10,636
Thanks.

318
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:13,636
Well, who's reading the proverbs?

319
00:18:13,636 --> 00:18:17,075
There isn't a single trace of the room being ruffled though.

320
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:22,736
So it looks like they didn't come to his home to search for something.

321
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:27,736
However, why did Kudo tell us to call the police?

322
00:18:27,736 --> 00:18:31,089
What could he possibly discern from that video call?

323
00:18:33,436 --> 00:18:36,136
This door is locked.

324
00:18:37,736 --> 00:18:39,736
Isn't this the restroom?

325
00:18:39,736 --> 00:18:42,436
My husband is inside.

326
00:18:42,436 --> 00:18:44,036
His stomach has been acting up,

327
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:46,036
so he's been inside, for a while.

328
00:18:46,036 --> 00:18:48,236
There's another restroom in the back.

329
00:18:48,236 --> 00:18:49,636
Use that one instead.

330
00:18:49,636 --> 00:18:51,109
Yes.

331
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:54,736
Pops. Sorry, I didn't mean to rush you.

332
00:18:54,736 --> 00:18:56,636
Yes, don't worry about it.

333
00:19:01,936 --> 00:19:03,636
If I were to shoo those brats off,

334
00:19:03,636 --> 00:19:06,636
they'd probably go and call the police.

335
00:19:06,636 --> 00:19:08,336
So I'll just be patient

336
00:19:08,336 --> 00:19:10,136
and let them play one round of karuta.

337
00:19:10,136 --> 00:19:13,736
However, if you try to make so much as a peep,

338
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:17,636
instead of grabbing karuta cards, I'll be grabbing your life.

339
00:19:31,636 --> 00:19:33,151
Well, let's move on.

340
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:36,036
The dog that trots about finds a bone.

341
00:19:36,036 --> 00:19:37,536
Got it.

342
00:19:37,536 --> 00:19:39,536
Ayumi did it again.

343
00:19:39,536 --> 00:19:41,159
That's awesome.

344
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:43,161
You've grabbed six cards already.

345
00:19:44,536 --> 00:19:48,736
Last night I had my parents help me practice.

346
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:52,836
On the other hand, you still have zero cards.

347
00:19:52,836 --> 00:19:54,836
I just haven't gotten going yet.

348
00:19:54,836 --> 00:19:57,536
Now, let's keep the ball rolling.

349
00:19:57,536 --> 00:20:00,336
All right, I'm gonna grab the next one.

350
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:04,936
Haste makes waste.

351
00:20:04,936 --> 00:20:06,736
Yes, this one.

352
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:12,736
Evidence speaks louder than words.

353
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:22,136
Add insult to injury.

354
00:20:22,136 --> 00:20:23,201
Got it.

355
00:20:24,636 --> 00:20:25,936
On to the next one.

356
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:29,207
A hated child thrives better in the world.

357
00:20:40,336 --> 00:20:42,236
I was the first to take this.

358
00:20:42,236 --> 00:20:44,436
Liar, I was faster than you.

359
00:20:44,436 --> 00:20:46,736
No way. I was faster.

360
00:20:46,736 --> 00:20:49,227
Well, why don't you guys sort it out by rock-paper-scissors?

361
00:20:49,436 --> 00:20:52,136
No way. I'll never let you have it.

362
00:20:52,136 --> 00:20:54,536
Because this card "ni" is my card.

363
00:20:55,936 --> 00:20:58,236
You mean, "A hated child thrives better in the world"

364
00:20:58,236 --> 00:20:59,836
is your card?

365
00:20:59,836 --> 00:21:02,236
Since this is Masao's first card,

366
00:21:02,236 --> 00:21:03,936
why don't you let him have it?

367
00:21:06,636 --> 00:21:08,236
Fine.

368
00:21:24,336 --> 00:21:27,265
A card he'd never let go...

369
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:28,336
Is he trying to form a message

370
00:21:28,336 --> 00:21:30,636
with the characters on the karuta cards?

371
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,650
Next Conan's Hint:

372
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,367
"Horsehair Crab".

373
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,369
Conan, since crabs are hard to eat.

374
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:12,834
Here, open your mouth.

375
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:14,660
No, no, I'll eat it myself.
