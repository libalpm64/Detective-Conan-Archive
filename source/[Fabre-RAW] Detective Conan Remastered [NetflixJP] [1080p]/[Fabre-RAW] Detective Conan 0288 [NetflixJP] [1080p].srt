1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,770
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,270
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,870
The time Ran and I spent in New York

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,470
were days of rain and mysteries which led to fond memories.

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,970
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,770
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,770
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:01,960
My mom takes Ran and me to see a musical in New York.

9
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,560
While we were being given the backstage tour,

10
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,060
we met an actor, Heath Flockhart,

11
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,460
who ends up getting shot to death.

12
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,760
A feather?

13
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,160
How'd it get stuck here?

14
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,360
I get it now.

15
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,360
"Shinichi In New York (Part 3)"

16
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,410
From this position,

17
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:44,210
it doesn't look like any of you four could have shot him from above.

18
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,410
Then would you mind if we changed our clothes?

19
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,410
Go ahead, you all have tested negative for gunpowder residue.

20
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,910
Which means the killer was probably someone from the outside.

21
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,510
Yeah. That's the only explanation.

22
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,710
Who turned the lights off?

23
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,810
Me, I did it!

24
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,610
Some people know me as the most beautiful actress in Japan.

25
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:14,510
Others know me as the globe-trotting mystery writer's wife.

26
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,110
But in reality, I am...

27
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,010
a highly intelligent female detective.

28
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,210
I am Night Baroness!

29
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,510
Excuse me, light man! I'm over here!

30
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,210
Yukiko.

31
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,610
That's right!

32
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,710
Captain, the fog has been lifted.

33
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,810
I'm talking about the fog

34
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,910
that hid the truth behind the murder of course.

35
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,510
What?

36
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,910
Hey mom, don't get carried away and mess up the ending.

37
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:48,310
Don't worry, I'll tell it exactly as you told me to.

38
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,410
Gosh.

39
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,110
Hey, are you sure you're right?

40
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,110
If you're wrong, your mom's going to look like a fool.

41
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,710
I'm sure.

42
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,810
Don't you think it's strange?

43
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:04,610
Heath's 6'3 tall, that's about 190 centimeters.

44
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08,110
That's just about the height of you with the pamphlet on your head

45
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,110
when I measured it just now, the pamphlet stuck out over the mirror.

46
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,110
And on top of that, Heath had those wings on his back,

47
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:19,310
so he couldn't bend over, even if he were behind the mirror.

48
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,210
You'd be able to see the top of his head.

49
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,210
That's why the killer used that certain thing,

50
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,810
so his head wouldn't stick out.

51
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,610
Performers use it

52
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,910
to appear and disappear suddenly on stage,

53
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,310
it's called a trap door.

54
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,910
But there wasn't anything like that behind the mirror.

55
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,910
There was only a strange metal cover on the floor beside it.

56
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,710
Stupid.

57
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,910
If you see a cover, you should know there's a hole under it.

58
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:55,910
Feathers from Heath's wings were caught under the cover,

59
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,210
and the blood on the floor under the lid was arc-shaped,

60
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,910
and the stage has a doughnut-shaped ditch,

61
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,010
now add the crooked curtain near the ditch

62
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,510
and you should get the picture.

63
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,610
By moving the doughnut-shaped floor like that,

64
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,710
the unseen trap-door...

65
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,710
opens right up.

66
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:26,610
I think if you check it, you're going to find

67
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,710
more feathers, the gunshot probably knocked more off

68
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,910
and you should find Heath's blood.

69
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,710
And you'll probably find the bullet casing from the gun, too.

70
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,710
If the bullet casing's there,

71
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,010
that means he was shot at close range?

72
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,010
That's right.

73
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,110
Heath was standing by under the trap door

74
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,610
the metal lid was resting against the mirror,

75
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,010
the killer shot him from above

76
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,610
by sticking her right hand which held the gun,

77
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,610
between the mirror and the lid.

78
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,210
Are you saying the killer...

79
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,210
Yes. The only one capable of doing it,

80
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:05,610
under those circumstances, was the once lying beside the mirror,

81
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,110
Rose, it was you, wasn't it?

82
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,210
Rose?

83
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,810
I don't believe it. It can't be.

84
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,910
I mean, no one, not even the staff mentioned

85
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,210
the trap door would be used!

86
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,410
I'm sure that's true,

87
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,710
because...

88
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:27,010
It's not that the staff didn't tell you. They couldn't.

89
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,210
All of you believe the mirror's your guardian spirit,

90
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,210
they couldn't tell you that it's been damaged.

91
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,910
I'm pretty sure Rose did it when no one was looking.

92
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,010
When the stagehands saw the crack,

93
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,710
they removed the damaged portion.

94
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,110
Then adjusted the frame to cover it up.

95
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,710
So everyone wouldn't be upset and worry about having bad luck.

96
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:55,210
But since the frame was made shorter, Heath's head would show,

97
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,110
they knew that if they put the mirror on a stand,

98
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,210
everyone would be suspicious and notice it'd been damaged.

99
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,310
That's why they decided, on the spur of the moment,

100
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,310
to use the trap door so that Heath would be out of sight.

101
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,410
They only told Heath and Rose about it.

102
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,910
But why did they tell Rose?

103
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,410
Isn't it obvious?

104
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,410
By moving the doughnut-shaped floor,

105
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,710
they'd be able to hide the opening.

106
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,610
But unless Rose reached under the mirror to lower the lid,

107
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,210
the audience would see it.

108
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,510
Then what about the gun?

109
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,710
It fell from way up high.

110
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,610
She was lying on the floor, she couldn't have thrown it up that high.

111
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,110
Of course she can.

112
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,610
Heath the angel was going to be suspended in mid-air,

113
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,410
all she had to do was use him.

114
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,510
Remember? Heath had a burn mark on his neck.

115
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,510
I'm sure he got it when she put the gun there,

116
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,110
it'd just been fired so it was hot.

117
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,310
If she put the gun there in the folds of his costume

118
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,110
and when he stopped being lifted, the vibration would cause it to fall,

119
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,510
that was the idea.

120
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,310
But I don't think she ever imagined for a second

121
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,010
he'd grab her with his bloodied hand.

122
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:14,110
The reason the blood in his palm was smeared

123
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,410
proves that he grabbed her hand.

124
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,910
And the proof should still be there

125
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,210
on her right hand and on the inside of her glove.

126
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,510
Heath's hate-filled handprint.

127
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,110
I'm pretty sure she performed

128
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,110
with her gloves inside out.

129
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,210
And after firing the gun,

130
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,410
she quickly turned them back correctly.

131
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,610
So that she wouldn't test positive for gun powder residue

132
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,410
after the investigation started.

133
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:51,410
But Shinichi, when'd you realize there was blood on her glove?

134
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:55,710
I realized it when I saw her struggle to open the can of juice

135
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,810
in the dressing room.

136
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,310
All she had to do was take her gloves off, but she didn't.

137
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,810
So I figured she was hiding something under them.

138
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,110
But then I also got an epiphany right there

139
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,610
and then as to her motive for killing Heath.

140
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,810
Her motive?

141
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,110
Both Lila and Akane had photos on their mirrors,

142
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,710
taken with Heath.

143
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,210
But, not Rose, her photo...

144
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,610
The angel.

145
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,010
Her photo was of him in his angel costume.

146
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,710
You weren't in love with him,

147
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,410
you were in love with his role as the angel.

148
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,710
That's right.

149
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,910
That's why I killed him as the angel Michael.

150
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:46,910
Because I just found it unbearable.

151
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:52,710
But he was quitting because he was going to star in a movie.

152
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,710
It was his own decision, though.

153
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:58,310
He was responsible for Michael's death!

154
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:03,410
He knew how much I loved him as Michael and he still did it.

155
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:09,710
But it seems that God was watching over me.

156
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,910
When the suit armor fell, I couldn't run away

157
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,910
because my clothes were caught on a nail and God saved me.

158
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,510
Thank you, sweet angel.

159
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,610
You helped me do it.

160
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,410
All right, then, Shin!

161
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:43,810
I have to go to the police station and stand in when they question her,

162
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,510
so you'll have to go back to the hotel by taxi.

163
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,610
Okay.

164
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:52,210
And by the way, be careful, there's a slasher on the loose.

165
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,710
He's Japanese and has long hair.

166
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,310
See you later, Shin!

167
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:01,810
Good grief, she still treats me like a kid.

168
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,910
Doesn't she realizes I'm in high school already?

169
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:10,210
And then, this is what Holmes said,

170
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,210
"Even if the world does revolve around the moon,

171
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:17,110
it will never affect my work in any way", how'd you like that?

172
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,110
What's the matter, Ran?

173
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:24,110
You're not letting what Rose said to you back there bother you, are you?

174
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,310
Did she says something?

175
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,010
Her English was so fast, I didn't understand a word.

176
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,410
Forget it, then.

177
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,810
It wasn't important anyway.

178
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,410
Would you mind closing the window?

179
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,210
You're going to catch a cold.

180
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:40,610
Didn't you say you were feeling like of hot since this morning?

181
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,810
Oh, I'm fine already.

182
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,110
Besides, if I close the window,

183
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,410
I won't be able to see the city lights very well.

184
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,410
But if the rain comes in and the seat gets wet,

185
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,910
the driver's not going to be happy.

186
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,110
Don't worry.

187
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,710
I have a handkerchief. I'll wipe the wet areas before I get out.

188
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,710
Good grief.

189
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,610
Excuse me. Stop the car! Please, stop!

190
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:11,610
That's strange. It should be around here.

191
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,210
I wonder if it got blown away by the wind.

192
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,810
Just forget it! It's just a handkerchief.

193
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,610
It's not just an ordinary handkerchief!

194
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,310
Sharon gave it to me. It's very precious.

195
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,110
I guess there is no God, after all.

196
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,510
Isn't that it?

197
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,410
See, it's caught on the railing of those stairs that white thing.

198
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,210
It looks like an old abandoned building.

199
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,410
I'll get it for you right now. You wait for me by the taxi.

200
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,210
If there is a God, it wouldn't work out this unfairly.

201
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:49,010
Thank you, sweet angel.

202
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:52,110
You help me do it.

203
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,410
I wonder if Sharon knew about it?

204
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,210
That Rose will commit the crime

205
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,010
and I saved the murderer's life.

206
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,910
It's all my fault.

207
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,810
If I hadn't saved her, then.

208
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,610
Heath wouldn't have been killed.

209
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,310
It's all my fault.

210
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,910
It's my...

211
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:27,310
A Japanese man with long hair?

212
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,860
A gun?

213
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,060
Oh, no.

214
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,560
I... I can't move.

215
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,660
Hey, hurry up. Jump in.

216
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,360
He must be the serial killer! Come on!

217
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,460
Darn!

218
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,960
Hey. Wait!

219
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,460
Are you Japanese?

220
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,960
I asked you if you're Japanese.

221
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,060
Yes, I am.

222
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,460
Did you see a suspicious man around?

223
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,160
What?

224
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,460
A Japanese with long hair dyed silver and sporting a beard.

225
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,460
No, I haven't seen anyone like that.

226
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,860
Did you find him, sir?

227
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,860
No, I only found a tourist.

228
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,460
I guess he wasn't on this street.

229
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,760
The shootout we had with the animal must have shaken him up.

230
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,560
Otherwise there's no way he'd pass up killing the girl.

231
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,560
This is no place for you, young lady.

232
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,560
Turn right at that corner and you'll be on the main street

233
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,560
and get a cab right away.

234
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,360
But wait, I have a friend.

235
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,860
I'm waiting for my friend here,

236
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,260
he's a boy and same age as me.

237
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,960
Then I'll tell you and that friend of yours one more time.

238
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,460
Get lost!

239
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,160
Get out of this area right now!

240
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,060
Can we leave her alone?

241
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,560
No problem.

242
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,960
Every crossing to this street is already secured.

243
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,260
So it's true...

244
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,560
that the serial killer's somewhere around here.

245
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,160
I've got to let Shinichi know right away and we've got get out of here.

246
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,560
Shinichi! Hey!

247
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,960
What's that? I just saw something red.

248
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,760
Blood.

249
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,060
It couldn't be Shinichi's, could it?

250
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,260
Something's happened to Shinichi.

251
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,460
Shinichi!

252
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,760
Oh, no. Is my cold coming back?

253
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,960
Come on, Ran. You've got to get a hold of yourself.

254
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:01,060
Shinichi came in here because you let your handkerchief go.

255
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,060
That's right. It's all my fault.

256
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,660
It's all my fault...

257
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,460
Somebody's coming down.

258
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,160
Shinichi.

259
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,060
Silver hair.

260
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,060
Blood.

261
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,760
Ran, get away from there! That's the serial killer!

262
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,860
He's right, girlie.

263
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,060
I was hiding out in here.

264
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,660
But that kid found me.

265
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,060
If you're going to blame somebody, you should blame God

266
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,960
for putting you in this situation.

267
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,960
What're you doing?

268
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,660
Hurry! Grab my arm!

269
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,060
Hurry, my hand's slippery because of the rain!

270
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,260
Shinichi.

271
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,660
Good grief, you're so much trouble.

272
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,960
Why'd you do it? Why'd you saved me?

273
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,060
I don't understand.

274
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,060
Do we need a reason?

275
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,560
I don't know what makes a person kill another person

276
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,060
but I do know why people save each other...

277
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,160
Logical thinking, doesn't exist, does it?

278
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,860
I see.

279
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,360
That's right.

280
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,760
I should have realized it earlier.

281
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,460
How foolish of me.

282
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,660
Ran.

283
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,060
Don't do it.

284
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:59,360
I notice you're wounded, which mean the police must be close by.

285
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,460
You don't have a silencer, if you shoot,

286
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,460
the police will be all over the place.

287
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:08,160
Not only that, you'll be giving me the opportunity to capture you, too.

288
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,260
I'll let you go today,

289
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,260
but if we ever meet again, I won't be so lenient.

290
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,860
I'll be like the Devil and list all your sins

291
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,060
and look at all the evidence

292
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,360
then I'll send you straight to hell, so don't you forget it!

293
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,560
That's right. Didn't you see it on the news?

294
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,760
They found that serial killer.

295
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,860
Shin turned him in!

296
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,460
But when the police got there,

297
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,460
he'd already been shot, they say it was a suicide.

298
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,160
Yes, Ran's fine!

299
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,360
She had a fever last night but after a good night's rest,

300
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,160
she's back to normal.

301
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:58,660
But so many things happened yesterday.

302
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,860
Sharon, you knew something was going to happen, didn't you?

303
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,960
You knew Rose was up to something, didn't you?

304
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,560
Yes. I've always had a sixth sense about things like that.

305
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,260
But I never imagined that she'd commit murder.

306
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,360
By the way, will you give Ran this message?

307
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,460
Tell her she was right,

308
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,460
there does seem to be an angel looking out for me.

309
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,560
Oh, really? Has something good happened?

310
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,060
I guess you could say that.

311
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,860
Hey, maybe you're not over your cold yet.

312
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,260
I'm fine, really.

313
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,660
I'm going to check if you have a fever, don't move.

314
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,560
I'm fine!

315
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:47,260
He was right! The doctor said her fever would go down and it did.

316
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,860
So you're awake!

317
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,560
They said your fever was caused by exhaustion

318
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,560
I guess you'll have to go easy on the studying and club activities now.

319
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:02,060
The fever made you delirious and you were mumbling something.

320
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,860
Something about saving somebody and about logical thinking and stuff.

321
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,160
No, stop! Those are my private thoughts...

322
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,660
What?

323
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,860
That's right. They're private thoughts and very personal.

324
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,160
I don't want you to say them in your raspy voice.

325
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,160
What do you mean by that?

326
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,360
All right, then. I'll come to pick you up tomorrow.

327
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,160
Stay here tonight and rest up!

328
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,260
Good night, Ran!

329
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,260
So that's what it was. I'd forgotten all about it.

330
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,460
That's when it started,

331
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:43,060
that's the moment I fell in love with Shinichi.

332
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,260
Something's the matter with me,

333
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,660
how could I have forgotten such an important event.

334
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,560
I guess the bad memories suppressed the good ones.

335
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,760
I met so many people and so many things happened.

336
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,860
That man in the black knit cap, I wonder who he was?

337
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,660
FBI?

338
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,860
So you were in bed because of a fever, no wonder.

339
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:40,360
So that's why you didn't answer the mail I sent you on the cellular,

340
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,460
Shinichi, were you worried about me?

341
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,360
I just thought they might've stopped service to your phone.

342
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,760
What's that supposed to mean?

343
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,060
So you feeling okay now?

344
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,860
Yes. I'm perfectly fine.

345
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,260
And thanks to the fever, I remembered what happened in New York.

346
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,060
That horrible case? Are you okay, though?

347
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,160
That case left you feeling really depressed.

348
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,960
Don't worry, I remembered some good things too.

349
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,760
By the way, what happened to Sharon's handkerchief?

350
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,460
Remember, you went into the abandoned building to get it for me?

351
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,660
Oh, that? I have it!

352
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,160
Oops. I wonder where I put it.

353
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,260
Two murders took place that day,

354
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,660
and I didn't want it to bring back those memories, so I put it away.

355
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,160
Two murders?

356
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,860
The serial killer committed suicide, didn't he?

357
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,260
Yes, that's what the police report said.

358
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,760
The blood stains and fingerprints

359
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,260
that should've been there had been wiped clean.

360
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,360
If you were going to commit suicide,

361
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,060
would you go through all the trouble of covering up your tracks?

362
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,060
I'm pretty sure...

363
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:51,060
somebody shot him just before he was going to make his get away.

364
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,960
Somebody got to him before the police arrived.

365
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,940
Next Conan's Hint:

366
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,140
"Lemon Scent"

367
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,820
I'm stuck with another tough case,

368
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,080
I don't think I can get back anytime soon.

369
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,580
Never mind, I'm used to it already.
