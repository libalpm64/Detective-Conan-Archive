1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,770
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,770
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,270
Lost in the forest with a cold blooded killer.

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,370
Everyone's emotions shine brightly.

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,770
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,770
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,570
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,010
Summer vacation is here.

9
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,510
Mitsuhiko has skipped the morning exercises and everyone is worried,

10
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,510
so we go his house to check up on him.

11
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,010
But according to his sister Asama,

12
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,110
he told her he was going camping with us

13
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,010
and he packed his backpack with sasadango and sun screen

14
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,810
then snuck out of the house early in the morning.

15
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,310
Thinking it suspicious, we start to ask around about him.

16
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,410
We finally track him to a forest in Gunma Prefecture.

17
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,510
I try many times to contact him on his detective badge

18
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,910
but he doesn't respond.

19
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,310
And while we're trying to figure out what to do,

20
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,310
we run into Detective Yamamura of the Gunma Prefecture Police.

21
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,710
The truth is...

22
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,010
I can't say this out loud,

23
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,010
but that veteran officer let a criminal escape

24
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,510
during the crime scene investigation.

25
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,110
It's that serial killer, Kiichiro Numabuchi.

26
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,310
Are you serious?

27
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,210
That killer we met in Osaka is here in this forest.

28
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,710
That's why you've got to hurry and leave.

29
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,510
But one of their friends is somewhere in here.

30
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,310
Hey, Conan.

31
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,610
We've got to let Mitsuhiko know about this right away.

32
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,710
Gosh! Why aren't you answering, Mitsuhiko?

33
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,510
It's beeping again.

34
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,010
It must be Conan.

35
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:19,010
I knew they'd come look for me.

36
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,210
But if I answer them now,

37
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,010
all my effort would have been in vain.

38
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:45,110
"Mitsuhiko Lost In The Woods (Part 2)"

39
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,610
Still no answer from Mitsuhiko?

40
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,710
No.

41
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:56,010
Maybe he fell asleep someplace?

42
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,510
Or maybe Numabuchi's already got him.

43
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,310
Hey, don't say that, Ai!

44
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,410
It's not completely impossible, you know.

45
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,310
The man hiding out in these woods is a cold blooded killer.

46
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,910
He went on a three day killing spree.

47
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,710
How do you know all that?

48
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,310
There was a big article in the newspaper about it.

49
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,710
He murdered three people.

50
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,210
-It's four people. -Huh?

51
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,910
During the interrogation, he admitted killing four people.

52
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,710
He said he buried the fourth victim here in this forest,

53
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,610
his mother is from this area.

54
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,310
So he was brought here from Osaka

55
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,610
and we were inspecting the crime scene since this morning.

56
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,710
But he couldn't remember where he buried the body,

57
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,810
so we had to dig and dig but we couldn't find it.

58
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:44,810
The detectives from Osaka left Numabuchi in our charge

59
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,310
and left to buy lunch, that's when it happened.

60
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,010
You let him escape.

61
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:54,310
I'll bet he was planning his escape all along.

62
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,310
But he didn't act like he intended to.

63
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,310
He was telling us about how he'd always come to this forest to play

64
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,310
when his mother came to visit her family.

65
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,710
What happened?

66
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,410
It's so cold!

67
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,310
It's a river.

68
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,110
Hey, are you alright?

69
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,310
Yes. I just got a little scratched.

70
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,210
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

71
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,110
The water that flows through this forest is clean.

72
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,110
When we were kids, we used to drink from this river.

73
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,610
My friends and I used to play here a lot when we were kids.

74
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,110
That's why I had an easy time talking to Numabuchi.

75
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,110
And you let him get away, you're a sorry excuse for a cop.

76
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,710
What a mess. We don't have a single clue.

77
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,710
How can we find him even I don't know where to start?

78
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:43,910
Well, I don't know if this will help.

79
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,610
You have three clues.

80
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,610
A lemony smell.

81
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,510
The names of the generals.

82
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,510
And the sasadango!

83
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,110
What are you talking about?

84
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,310
Mitsuhiko got scolded by some strange men

85
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,210
for mentioning the names of those generals.

86
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,410
He packed his backpack with sasadango

87
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,910
and came here smelling like lemons.

88
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,310
Nothing you're saying makes any sense.

89
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,210
But the lemon scent is a sure clue.

90
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,010
The smell's probably from lemon grass or citronella.

91
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,910
It's a common ingredient In insect repellant.

92
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,910
Insect repellant?

93
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,510
Bug spray.

94
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,810
Remember what his sister Asami said?

95
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,810
She said Mitsuhiko took the sun screen

96
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,410
that she'd bought on the shop channel with him.

97
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,310
You don't see it in Japan, but in some foreign countries,

98
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,610
they sell insect repellant that doubles as sun screen.

99
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,610
I see. Mitsuhiko applied the cream

100
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,810
not to protect himself against the sun,

101
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,810
it was to keep the bugs away.

102
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,910
Which means he meant to come here from the very beginning.

103
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,310
But why?

104
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,810
I don't understand the sasadango or the generals' names.

105
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,910
"Kibidango" would point to "Momotaro".

106
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,510
Nu... Numabuchi!

107
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,010
-Gosh! I'll get him! -Wait!

108
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,810
He knows this forest and besides, it's too dark.

109
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,110
We'll get lost if we go after him.

110
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,010
Our first objective is to find Mitsuhiko.

111
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,910
Right...

112
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,210
I didn't feel it just now.

113
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,810
I didn't feel a thing.

114
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,310
Why?

115
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,810
Amazing. He was hiding out in a tree.

116
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,110
He's like a monkey.

117
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,510
Yes, he is.

118
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,110
When he was a child,

119
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,810
he told me he used to jump from tree to tree.

120
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,710
He said he pretended he was learning to be a ninja.

121
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,510
A ninja?

122
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,210
It couldn't be, he...

123
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,610
Dr. Agasa, look after everyone!

124
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,010
Huh?

125
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,210
Conan!

126
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,610
Don't worry. I'll bring Mitsuhiko back with me!

127
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,910
Just you wait!

128
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,010
It's no use.

129
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,610
I can't go any further.

130
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,810
I should just give up.

131
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,110
Contact Conan and the others and let them know where I am.

132
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,210
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

133
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,810
That's Conan's voice!

134
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,810
I'm over here. Over here, Conan.

135
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,710
Conan...

136
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,410
Who are you?

137
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:42,910
Guess we're the same.

138
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,910
-Huh? -You and I.

139
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,710
We're the same.

140
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,510
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

141
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,110
Where are you?

142
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,110
If you can hear my voice,

143
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,910
pick up your detective badge and answer me!

144
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,810
It's dangerous in this forest!

145
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,210
There's a killer on the loose in here!

146
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,810
Give up what you're doing and answer me!

147
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,610
Mitsuhiko!

148
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,510
Gosh! Where are you?

149
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:17,710
If my theory's right, he's somewhere along this river.

150
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,410
Is it possible he's already come across that guy?

151
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,510
What's this?

152
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,610
You're the kid that was talking to Yamamura just a little while ago.

153
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,310
Detective.

154
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,610
Didn't you leave this forest with Yamamura?

155
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,710
But I think my friend's lost someplace around here.

156
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,010
Your friend?

157
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,010
Sir!

158
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,210
Sir! So here you are!

159
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:50,710
Hey. Why didn't you report that a child was lost around here?

160
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:54,910
Well, so many things were happening all at once.

161
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,010
By the way, sir! Big news!

162
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,310
What?

163
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,610
Kiichiro Numabuchi's been located!

164
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,710
-Really? -Are you sure?

165
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,410
So where is he? Has he been captured?

166
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,710
Come on.

167
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,910
You know I can't capture him all by myself.

168
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,010
He got away from me so easily.

169
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:18,810
So tell me, where was he hiding?

170
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,910
On top of a tree.

171
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,510
He climbed up the tree like a monkey.

172
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,310
When our eyes met, he jumped down and ran away.

173
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,610
And he ran off into the forest.

174
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,610
Isn't that right, Yama-san?

175
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,110
Yama-san?

176
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:38,710
And then, Conan said he'd go after him all by himself.

177
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,210
I wasn't chasing him.

178
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,110
I just had an idea where Mitsuhiko might be.

179
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,410
He's somewhere along this river.

180
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,010
Along the river?

181
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,510
What's along the river?

182
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,510
Are you talking about the treasure?

183
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,710
No. I just assumed that's where'd he be.

184
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,510
Conan's right.

185
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,010
It looks like he was by this river,

186
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,610
but I don't think we should go by that theory anymore.

187
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,510
See. This is the cap

188
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,310
I borrowed from Mitsuhiko at the last soccer game.

189
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:15,010
He didn't stop to pick it up after he dropped it,

190
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,610
which means he was in a big hurry.

191
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,310
You mean, Mitsuhiko's...

192
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,710
That bad man's caught him.

193
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,810
We've got to find him!

194
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,310
Okay. We've got to be careful, that boy might be his hostage.

195
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:33,010
-Relay this message to the others! -Yes, sir...

196
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,410
This is terrible.

197
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:40,710
If Mitsuhiko's running away, how do we find him?

198
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:45,010
Well, he couldn't have gotten too far.

199
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,510
The perspiration on the cap's not dry yet,

200
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,410
and it's still warm.

201
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,510
But Conan, you were yelling to him, weren't you?

202
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,910
Why didn't he answer you?

203
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:58,410
-He probably couldn't. -What?

204
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,610
Mitsuhiko probably arrived here just before noon.

205
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,610
We had to ask around, so we got here in the evening.

206
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:11,310
If Mitsuhiko got lost and was calling for help all that time...

207
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,110
I'm sure his voice would be hoarse by now.

208
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,710
He wouldn't be able to call out.

209
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,410
That's terrible.

210
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,210
But he's got the detective badge,

211
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,010
he doesn't need to talk so loud.

212
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,910
I know. If he contacted us with the badge,

213
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,910
we'd have been able to find him right away.

214
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,510
But that's if he could use his hands.

215
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,610
What?

216
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,810
Are you saying he's hurt his hands?

217
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:35,910
Calm down now.

218
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,410
Don't get so excited. Let's find him first.

219
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,910
If he's around here, I think we should start looking already.

220
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:45,410
But Mitsuhiko can't talk,

221
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:48,510
and maybe he's been captured by that bad man, right?

222
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,410
How're we going to find him?

223
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,610
Then let's go look for that killer!

224
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,610
But it's so dark

225
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,110
and I didn't get a really good look at his face.

226
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,710
Let's see.

227
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,510
According to the news, Numabuchi's characteristics are...

228
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,010
His thin eyebrows, sunken eyes.

229
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,110
Hollow cheeks, upturned nose.

230
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,710
His face is skeletal, just skin and bones.

231
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,010
His postures bad

232
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,610
but he's agile and fast, like an animal.

233
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,910
Then all we've got to do is look for somebody who looks like a skeleton!

234
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,310
Guess so.

235
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:29,310
But Ai, how do you know so much about him?

236
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,510
Hey, don't tell me Numabuchi's...

237
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,610
Yes. That's right.

238
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,510
Kiichiro Numabuchi was once a part of that group.

239
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:43,010
He was once one of your so called Men in Black.

240
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,160
But then he was just one of the small potatoes.

241
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,960
The organization hired him because he was agile.

242
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,960
I think they intended to train him to become one of their hit men.

243
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,860
But he turned out to be useless

244
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,560
so they were going to send him to me

245
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,960
so I could use him as a guinea pig to test my potions.

246
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,560
Are you serious?

247
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,360
That's why I know him so well.

248
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,060
Before he became a test subject,

249
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:24,060
they sent me his file, complete with photos and personal data.

250
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,160
He escaped before being sent to me

251
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,860
and since I dropped out of the organization,

252
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,660
we never did get to meet though.

253
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,860
He escaped?

254
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,860
I guess he got scared.

255
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,060
He realized how big the organization was,

256
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,960
so he ran and kept running from their influence,

257
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,460
afraid they'd catch up to him.

258
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,360
Poor guy, he killed three people

259
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,660
because he thought they were from the organization

260
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,360
and they were after him.

261
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,560
But then I feel no sympathy towards him

262
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,160
because I heard he killed some people for fun

263
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,160
before joining the organization.

264
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,960
I remember when he got arrested,

265
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,060
he yelled into the television cameras, "It's their fault!"

266
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:11,660
Yes, but no one believed him

267
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,260
and since he wasn't deeply involved with them,

268
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,660
the organization washed their hands of him.

269
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,260
But I don't understand.

270
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,660
Didn't you tell me once

271
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,960
that you could tell when someone from the organization

272
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,660
was around because of their smell.

273
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,860
That's right. That's why I'm worried.

274
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,760
I didn't feel anything back there.

275
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,960
My sister gave off a smell even before that incident.

276
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,060
That was my only danger barometer.

277
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,260
I must be losing it.

278
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,360
I'm getting too accustomed to this normal life.

279
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,560
I guess I'm getting soft.

280
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,660
Good for you!

281
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,660
What?

282
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,260
That proves you're becoming a normal human being, right?

283
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,160
Come on! We've got to hurry and find Mitsuhiko.

284
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,860
His probably dying to see

285
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,160
the smiles on you and Ayumi's normal faces.

286
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,060
Me and Ayumi's?

287
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,660
Yeah, because the reason he came here in the first place is...

288
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,460
Listen, don't you hear that?

289
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,360
That sounds like the detective badge.

290
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,660
It's getting louder.

291
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,860
It's getting closer.

292
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,460
Hey, Mitsuhiko...

293
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,960
Numabuchi!

294
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,360
Kii...

295
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,360
Kiichiro Numabuchi! I... I've got you!

296
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,760
Turn all those lights off.

297
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,060
Those lights are going to scare them off.

298
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,460
Them?

299
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,060
What do you mean? Are you saying your gang's here too?

300
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,260
That's right.

301
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,060
Be careful, because there's a whole bunch of them.

302
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,860
We're not falling for that one.

303
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,160
Good grief! We were so worried.

304
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,560
I'm sorry.

305
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,560
You sound bad.

306
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,760
I see your badge is working.

307
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,860
Why didn't you respond to our call?

308
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,860
I know, but my hands...

309
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,160
What's the matter?

310
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,660
You're hurt or something?

311
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,460
Wait!

312
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,960
-A firefly? -Yes.

313
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,860
A summer spectacle not seen in the city.

314
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,860
The old men who were scolding Mitsuhiko at the bus stop were probably...

315
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,560
the conservation group who come to this forest every Sunday

316
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,760
to protect the firefly.

317
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,960
Mitsuhiko probably asked them

318
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,460
for the location of this forest so many times,

319
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,060
they were afraid a lot of children would come

320
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,560
and trample through the forest they'd worked so hard to clean up,

321
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,360
that's why they got angry.

322
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,760
Because fireflies only live in clean water.

323
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,660
But Mitsuhiko was desperate, he had to find this place

324
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,960
so he followed them.

325
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,160
I see.

326
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,960
That's why he was acting so suspiciously on the bus.

327
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,960
He was following them.

328
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,060
Yes. He inadvertently pressed the same button they did

329
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:37,460
when buying the ticket at the train station,

330
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,860
that's why he bought the adult ticket.

331
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,360
But this doesn't have anything to do with any General's name.

332
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,360
Remember what the girl at the florist said?

333
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,260
She said it was either Uesugi and Takeda

334
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,360
or Toyotomi and Tokugawa either way.

335
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,660
They're rival generals, right?

336
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:00,360
And another group of famous rival generals would be

337
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,260
Genji and Heike.

338
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,760
Which brings us to Genji fireflies and Heike fireflies.

339
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,160
What about the sasadango then?

340
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,460
He'd moisten the sasa leaves then spread them out

341
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,860
in the bug container making a firefly holder.

342
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,760
He was going to put the fireflies inside

343
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,460
and bring them back with him.

344
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,360
Mitsuhiko did indeed manage to catch some fireflies

345
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,360
but he got lost.

346
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,160
His badge started to beep

347
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,560
and he knew we were here looking for him

348
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,160
but he couldn't use his hands.

349
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,660
That's why he couldn't pick the badge up.

350
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,560
Isn't that right, Mitsuhiko?

351
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,860
Gosh. If you were coming to catch bugs, you should've told us.

352
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,060
Don't be stupid.

353
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,160
He wouldn't have been able to surprise them

354
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,660
unless he kept it a secret.

355
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,660
On the way home after the fireworks display,

356
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,060
Ayumi and Ai said they'd like to see fireflies

357
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,960
at least once in their life.

358
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,460
What? You mean he...

359
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,960
He did for us.

360
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,060
Thank you.

361
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,560
It was beautiful!

362
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,560
But why'd Numabuchi...

363
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:23,760
He knew he'd be caught, so why'd he bring Mitsuhiko to us?

364
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,760
Who knows?

365
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,560
Maybe it's because he came here for the same reason Mitsuhiko did.

366
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,360
What do you mean?

367
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,760
He was in the tree listening to us.

368
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,260
He probably figured out that

369
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,060
a kid would come into the forest looking for fireflies.

370
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,160
And once he saw Mitsuhiko had his hands full,

371
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,760
he'd know for sure.

372
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:12,960
He probably lied about burying the fourth victim here.

373
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,760
He probably wanted to see them one more time before being executed.

374
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,260
See the old friends

375
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:22,260
he used to play with here when he was a child.

376
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:59,660
Hey, Ai. Did you see the news on TV yesterday?

377
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,060
There's so much excitement about a great discovery!

378
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,660
Really? Did they find Tokugawa's hidden treasure or something?

379
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,160
Of course not.

380
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,460
It's a legendary animal. Somebody's seen it.

381
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,660
I forget what it's called.

382
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,660
It wasn't "takenoko" and it's not "kananoko".

383
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,860
Tsuchinoko?

384
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,560
Yes, that's it!

385
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,960
I don't know what kind of animal it is

386
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,360
since they switched to another subject.

387
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,560
But wouldn't you like to see one too, Ai?

388
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,960
I guess so.

389
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,160
-Tsu... -Tsuchinoko.

390
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,660
If my memory serves me right,

391
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,460
there's been sightings in Gifu Prefecture

392
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,860
as well as Okayama Prefecture and Hyogo Prefecture.

393
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,260
I just remembered!

394
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,260
I'm going to go visit my uncle in Gifu soon.

395
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,760
I bet you're thinking of finding one so you can look good!

396
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,160
-And what's wrong with that? -Of course I do!

397
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,260
I wouldn't do it if I were you.

398
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,600
Next Conan's Hint:

399
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,980
"Letters in the sand"

400
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,300
Together with the duo from Osaka again.

401
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,140
They're so happy-go-lucky, I like them.
