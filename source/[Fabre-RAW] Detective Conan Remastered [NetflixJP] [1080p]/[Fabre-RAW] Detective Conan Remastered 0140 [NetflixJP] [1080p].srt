1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,980
Alibis, secret codes, tricks, deals.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,880
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,780
Today, Ayumi is put in a tight situation without a second to waste.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,880
Mystery and action.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,280
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,280
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,780
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:58,490
"SOS! Message from Ayumi"

9
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,690
Okay, I have it.

10
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,090
This is next... how about it?

11
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,990
Alright, I'm done.

12
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,790
Darn it.

13
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,490
Mitsuhiko and I are last again.

14
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,690
Mitsuhiko, you're last!

15
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,190
That's what you think.

16
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,190
Alright.

17
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,890
This one!

18
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,390
I did it.

19
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,690
I'm done.

20
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,190
Darn it.

21
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,690
Why do I lose all the time?

22
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,690
Well, even a kindergartener can beat you

23
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,790
just by looking at your face.

24
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,590
Anyway, your expression is totally different

25
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,190
when you're looking at the joker and when you're not.

26
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,590
Conan, don't tell him the secret.

27
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,090
Is that what it was?

28
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,490
Alright, one more time.

29
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,090
This time, I'll keep this face.

30
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,790
Haibara, would you like to participate too?

31
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,390
I would rather read this book.

32
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,990
You don't want to play with us.

33
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,690
You're cool as usual, aren't you?

34
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,690
That's right, Conan.

35
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,390
Do you know about the robbery murder

36
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,690
that took place yesterday in Haido Town?

37
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,290
Yeah, you mean the woman owner of the French restaurant, "Le Escargot",

38
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,190
that was killed, don't you?

39
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,190
That's a funny name for a restaurant.

40
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,090
It's not funny at all.

41
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:39,490
"Escargots" are edible snails used in French cuisine.

42
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,990
What? You can eat snails?

43
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,290
A snail-rice bowls?

44
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,990
"Snail-rice bowls"

45
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,290
What're you imagining?

46
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,190
And, have you heard any details on it?

47
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:01,690
Yes. Last night, I heard Pop Mouri talking with Inspector Megure.

48
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,490
He said the victim was asleep until near noon

49
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,290
and she met up with the robber who broke in.

50
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,490
Does that mean the robber sneaked in thinking that no one was home?

51
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,990
Looks like it.

52
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,590
The victim's hands and legs were tied

53
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,890
and she was stabbed with a knife.

54
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,290
Probably, the perpetrator made her tell where the money was,

55
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,090
took all of it,

56
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,290
and killed her just before he left.

57
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,890
He must've killed her because she saw his face.

58
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:32,890
Probably.

59
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,590
Frightening.

60
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,790
Looks like the Youth Detective Squad won't be making an appearance

61
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,990
with a vicious perpetrator like that around.

62
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,790
Of course not!

63
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,790
In the first place, children aren't suppose

64
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,890
to be talking about murder cases.

65
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,990
You should be talking about more children-like things with dreams.

66
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,790
Dr. Agasa, do you have some throat drops?

67
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,290
Does your throat hurt?

68
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,890
Come to think of it, Ayumi...

69
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,890
Your voice is a bit funny.

70
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,990
Let's have a look. Open your mouth.

71
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,290
Your tonsils are pretty swollen.

72
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,990
You seem to have a fever too.

73
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,290
Is it a cold?

74
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,790
If it's a cold, eat some broiled eel on rice

75
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,490
and it'll be gone with a flash.

76
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,790
Genta, she's not the same as you.

77
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,790
Ayumi, you'd better go home for today.

78
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,190
We'll go home too.

79
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,190
That's right. Please take a good rest at home.

80
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,490
That's good.

81
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,490
Well, I'll get the car ready,

82
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,390
so wait a minute.

83
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,090
"Teitan Elementary School, the following Monday" -Attention!

84
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,590
Good morning.

85
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,590
Yes, good morning.

86
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,790
Be seated.

87
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,090
Before I take attendance,

88
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,490
I just received a phone call from Ayumi Yoshida's mother.

89
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,290
Today, Ayumi will be out with a cold.

90
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,390
-Is she okay? -I thought so...

91
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:58,190
That Ayumi, didn't she eat any broiled eels on rice.

92
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,790
She seemed pretty bad yesterday.

93
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,590
Oh, worried?

94
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,090
Of course.

95
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,690
You're pretty kind, aren't you?

96
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,690
Be quiet.

97
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,090
"The condo where Ayumi's home is, Resident Tower"

98
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,590
Then, Ayumi...

99
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,190
I'll be gone for a little while.

100
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,790
I'll finish what I have to do as soon as possible

101
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,590
and I should be home by noon,

102
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,290
sleep quietly.

103
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,290
Goodbye...

104
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,190
Don't worry.

105
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,390
When the swelling in your throat goes down,

106
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,790
you'll be able to talk again.

107
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,190
Well, then...

108
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,190
Hello, Yoshida residence.

109
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,390
We are out at the moment.

110
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:04,390
Please leave your name and message after the peep sound.

111
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,690
Yes.

112
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,090
Miss Yamamoto, a delivery for you.

113
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,690
Yes, please come in.

114
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:53,990
"Yoshida"

115
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,790
It's Mother.

116
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,290
No. It's not Mother.

117
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:23,490
Mother wouldn't ring the doorbell.

118
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,690
A thief?

119
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,790
Police...

120
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,890
I've got to call the police.

121
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:35,290
A brat's room...

122
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,690
You're a good child. Don't hide, come out here.

123
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,090
I won't do anything.

124
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,790
What should I do?

125
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,390
It's probably that robber that Conan and the others were talking about.

126
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,590
If he catches me,

127
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,790
I'll definitely end up like the owner of "Escargot".

128
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:22,790
Let's go to visit Ayumi after school today.

129
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,790
I'm for it. She'll surely be happy.

130
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,190
Will she really?

131
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,290
Girls don't like

132
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:33,590
to have people see them when they're not feeling well

133
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,690
especially someone she likes.

134
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,290
Hey, hey.

135
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,590
But, I guess that has nothing to do with grade-school kids.

136
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,490
What's her problem?

137
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:52,090
She's a grade-school kid too.

138
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:07,490
It's probably Ayumi playing the keyboard harmonica.

139
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,390
Ayumi, is that you?

140
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,490
Today is the 5th... 10:30 am.

141
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:20,390
Today is the 5th... 10:30 am.

142
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,290
It's the Yaiba clock.

143
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,290
That's right. It's the Masked Yaiba clock.

144
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,490
Dr. Agasa bought it for us before.

145
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,190
You press the button on the head

146
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,690
and it tells the date and time.

147
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:37,190
But, why doesn't Ayumi answer herself?

148
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,490
Maybe she doesn't have a voice.

149
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,790
Hello, Ayumi.

150
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,490
Ayumi, is it that you don't have a voice?

151
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,890
Tap the badge once for "yes",

152
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,090
and twice for "no".

153
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,390
Once, that's a "yes".

154
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,690
She can't speak after all.

155
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:03,390
She probably bored and wanted to hear our voices.

156
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,990
Okay. Let's cheer her up.

157
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,990
Wait a minute.

158
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,290
Something bothers me.

159
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,790
I can understand why she used the clock's voice to reply

160
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,690
but, that clock was 5 minutes late.

161
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,890
In the first place, today isn't the 5th.

162
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,390
Well...

163
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:26,790
Isn't Ayumi trying to tell us something?

164
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:30,390
Ayumi, has some sort of trouble come up?

165
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:39,490
Ayumi, tap the badge once for "yes" and twice for "no".

166
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,690
That's "no".

167
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,690
She just contacted us because she's bored.

168
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,090
The lesson is about to start,

169
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,890
so we'll contact you again on our next break.

170
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,190
Oh no! Next is the music room.

171
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,190
We've got to hurry.

172
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,690
Teacher Kobayashi is frightening when she gets angry.

173
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,790
Got to make a dash for it.

174
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,690
A brat with a fancy toy.

175
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,380
"2nd Music Room"

176
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,380
Well, I think you all know, but...

177
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,380
next month, there will be a concert.

178
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,780
B class will be playing the keyboard harmonica.

179
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,880
Today, I'd like to decide on the piece we'll be playing.

180
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,080
Everyone, are there any good pieces?

181
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,380
-Yes. -Yes...

182
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,680
-Worried about Ayumi, aren't you? -Then, yes, Sato.

183
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,880
Yes.

184
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,680
-Me too. That melody she first played... -Yes, any other?

185
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,280
I've heard it somewhere.

186
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,580
Doesn't something come to mind?

187
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,280
I'm not good at music...

188
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,780
I'm sure it was... mi mi re do re.

189
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,480
Putting that aside,

190
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,080
wonder why the date and time were wrong?

191
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,980
Today is the 5th... 10:30 am.

192
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,080
5th... 10:30 am.

193
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,880
Well then, now that we've decided the tune.

194
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,380
First, let's try singing it together.

195
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,980
-Yes. -Yes...

196
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,280
"Mi Mi Re Do Re" -"Snail..."

197
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,680
"Snail"

198
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,080
-She wanted to tell us "snail". -"Where is your head?"

199
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,480
-That's it. -"Where is your head?"

200
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,980
Teacher! Please call the police!

201
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,380
Ayumi's life is in danger!

202
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,480
Wait, Edogawa!

203
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,080
Darn it, why didn't I realize it earlier?

204
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,880
From that melody, "snail"...

205
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,380
in other words, "Le Escargot".

206
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,880
She was trying to tell me there was a robber there.

207
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,380
It's probably at that time that Ayumi was caught by the robber.

208
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,180
Ayumi, has some sort of trouble come up?

209
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,580
Ayumi, tap the badge once for "yes" and twice for "no".

210
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,980
Please be safe,

211
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,180
Ayumi.

212
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,980
Haibara, I understand the situation.

213
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,380
Everyone, I'm going to go and call the police,

214
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,680
so please be quiet and review the lesson.

215
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,480
-Is it true? -Genta.

216
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,680
Mitsuhiko, let's go.

217
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,380
Darn, when I don't have a time...

218
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,880
Wait a minute.

219
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,680
The robber killed the woman owner

220
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,480
after he had taken all the money and was about to leave.

221
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,380
A total of 75,000 yen.

222
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,280
Living in a big condo like this and this is all there is.

223
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,980
Well, guess it's time to be leaving.

224
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,480
Hello, Yoshida residence.

225
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,680
We are out at the moment.

226
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:50,480
Please leave your name and message after the peep sound.

227
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,780
It's me...

228
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,380
Dr. Agasa.

229
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,280
I'm in the neighborhood right now.

230
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,780
Do you remember the 5,000,000 yen I borrowed?

231
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,380
Well, I thought I 'd like to return it

232
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,680
and have just been to the bank to withdraw the money.

233
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,380
5,000,000 yen?

234
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,880
The patient money for that invention came in.

235
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,980
You' re probably just at the nearby supermarket, aren't you?

236
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,180
I'll be right there.

237
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,080
That's right.

238
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,680
Conan probably got in contact with Dr. Agasa for me.

239
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,980
Hey!

240
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,480
That guy who just called is he your grandfather?

241
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,880
5,000,000 yen.

242
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,380
I can't let it go by...

243
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,680
It's me, open the door.

244
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,180
Alright.

245
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,380
Oh, no.

246
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,880
Dr. Agasa will be caught too.

247
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,480
What should I do?

248
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,680
Here it is, here it is.

249
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,380
Who are you?

250
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,880
Where's the old man?

251
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,380
There was only me from the very beginning.

252
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,780
You're a robber, aren't you?

253
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,080
Do you know that...

254
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,880
if a soccer ball hits you it hurts pretty bad?

255
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,180
Especially a ball

256
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:49,380
that's kicked with these Hyper-Shoes!

257
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,980
Ayumi!

258
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,780
Are you alright?

259
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,380
Wait, I'll set you free right now.

260
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,180
You brat... now you've done it.

261
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,480
Darn it, it didn't do any good with that helmet.

262
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,580
You won't get away for nothing.

263
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
Die!

264
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,680
-Stop it! -Stop it!

265
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,780
Who are you guys?

266
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,080
Genta Kojima.

267
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,080
Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya.

268
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,080
-The Youth Detective Squad. -The Youth Detective Squad.

269
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,780
What's that?

270
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,880
Run!

271
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,980
Don't make a fool of an adult!

272
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,380
We did it.

273
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,980
We sure did.

274
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,980
Great victory for the Youth Detective Squad!

275
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,480
You guys...

276
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,880
-Awesome. -We did something great.

277
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,080
"The Beika Park, few days later"

278
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,180
Ayumi, I'm glad you've gotten rid of your cold.

279
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,180
My voice is back to normal too.

280
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,980
But, that perpetrator...

281
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,980
I was surprised to find out that he was a different guy

282
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,580
from that robbery and murder case.

283
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,280
That murderer was caught in Yokohama, wasn't he?

284
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,080
According to Inspector Megure,

285
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,080
the perpetrator that entered Ayumi's home

286
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,380
didn't have intentions of harming her.

287
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,180
Even if she saw his face,

288
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:29,080
he thought that a child wouldn't have the ability to testify.

289
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,280
But, he did attack Conan.

290
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,880
So, it's only proper that he get caught.

291
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,680
Idiot!

292
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,680
What do you mean by, "only proper that he get caught"!

293
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,580
Things just went well this time.

294
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:46,880
From the next time, wait for the police before doing anything.

295
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,480
Yes. We'll do that the next time.

296
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,180
It's alright if you understand.

297
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,580
Hey, let's go ride the swings.

298
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,680
-Let's go, let's go. -Let's do that.

299
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,580
I wonder if they really understand.

300
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,280
Shinichi, that goes for you too.

301
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,480
I know.

302
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,880
As much as possible, I try not to get them involved.

303
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,880
Not that.

304
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,380
Your brain may be an adult

305
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:14,180
remember that your body's a grade school child.

306
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,580
In the first place...

307
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,280
Dr. Agasa!

308
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,180
Thank you!

309
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,880
If it weren't for your phone call,

310
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,480
the perpetrator would've got away.

311
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,080
I don't mind you using my voice

312
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,580
but, why did you have to make me a grandfather?

313
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,680
Sorry, sorry.

314
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:39,780
Anyway, having grandchildren like them would be pretty nice.

315
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,480
Okay, shall Grandfather give you a push?

316
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,880
He's completely into the role.

317
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,380
He should be looking for a bride before grandchildren.
