1
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,190
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,190
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,990
A strange member, a deep secret.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,990
What will become of Conan and Ai in the future?

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,490
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,590
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,790
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,250
Ai Haibara and I board a bus

9
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,650
with Dr. Agasa and the Youth Detective Squad

10
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,650
on our way to get in some Spring skiing.

11
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,950
On the way, Mr. Araide and Miss Jodie

12
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,150
also board the bus

13
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,850
and Haibara suddenly becomes scared, she's just not herself.

14
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,050
Just then,

15
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,150
two men wearing ski suits board the bus

16
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,250
and hijack it.

17
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,650
I hide and try to contact the police, but...

18
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,650
You little brat...

19
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,050
Brat! Try something like that again,

20
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,450
you're really going to get it!

21
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,650
Gosh. He took my phone.

22
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,950
Conan! Are you all right?

23
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,150
That's strange.

24
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,650
He came straight for me.

25
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,950
But I'm sure he couldn't see me. I was hiding behind the seat.

26
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,450
That must mean...

27
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,050
another one from their gang's on this bus.

28
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,650
It must be one of those three

29
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,350
since they could see what I was doing.

30
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,150
But how'd he let him know?

31
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,550
How'd he let him know where I was?

32
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,750
How'd he do it without anybody noticing?

33
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:29,050
"Mysterious Passenger (Part 2)"

34
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,650
Hey, Haibara. Do you have any ideas?

35
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,950
Hey.

36
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,650
Don't do anything foolish, cool kid.

37
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,050
You'll get your chance soon.

38
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,650
You don't have to be so scared.

39
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,250
What's your name, little red riding hood?

40
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,450
She's...

41
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:11,850
What's your name, little red riding hood?

42
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,950
She's a stranger.

43
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,750
We just happen to be sitting next to each other.

44
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,450
She's really scared, so I think we should leave her alone.

45
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,850
-I'm sorry! -You over there!

46
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,650
What're you doing over there?

47
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,750
Miss Jodie. Please don't upset them.

48
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,150
Oh, okay!

49
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,350
Let's talk about it later.

50
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,650
Sure.

51
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,950
Hey, don't tell me...

52
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,350
It can't be, someone's here?

53
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,750
Here, on this bus...

54
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,950
Someone from the organization?

55
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,650
But for now, we've got to find out

56
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,350
who these hijacker's partner is.

57
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,350
I've got to figure out who it is and take care of him,

58
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,850
for now, the organization is the least of my worries.

59
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,450
And those three are very suspicious.

60
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,050
The most suspicious one is...

61
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,950
the guy who has the opportunity to signal him by sound.

62
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,850
The guy who's been coughing.

63
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,450
That guy.

64
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,750
But then, Dr. Agasa is also coughing.

65
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,850
There's not too much difference in the sound of their coughs.

66
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,450
And if the signal's sound,

67
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,750
then that woman chewing gum is also a suspect.

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,600
But the coughing sound is louder.

69
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,400
Those guys were by the driver's seat that time.

70
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,500
They wouldn't be able to hear her chewing gum from there.

71
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,000
That leaves that guy with the hearing aid.

72
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,100
If that hearing aid were a wireless microphone,

73
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,700
he'd be able to whisper a message,

74
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,200
but neither of the hijackers

75
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,700
don't have anything in their ear.

76
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,700
Besides, if he said something,

77
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,900
the other two beside him would've heard him.

78
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,600
The only thing those hijackers are

79
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,200
also checking is that back mirror.

80
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,600
Hey, old man!

81
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,400
What're you messing with?

82
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,200
It's... only cough medicine.

83
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Again.

84
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,300
They've been signaled again.

85
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,600
Gosh! How's it being done?

86
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,100
How're they being signaled?

87
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,400
We've been waiting for your call, Mr. Yajima.

88
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,600
Well? How are things on your end?

89
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,100
No problem. I lost the cops.

90
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,300
All right then, we'll meet at the usual place 3 days from today.

91
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,400
Okay, driver.

92
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,600
Get on the expressway then the Chuo freeway.

93
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes, sir!

94
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,700
When you get to the Kobotoke Tunnel,

95
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,700
drop your speed.

96
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,500
Don't worry about anything.

97
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,600
We'll release the passengers, just like you told us to.

98
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,000
Hey! You with the glasses,

99
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,700
and that guy in the back coughing!

100
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,000
You two get up here.

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,800
What're you doing? Hurry up!

102
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,700
You better do it. It's for your own good.

103
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,100
So that's how you did it.

104
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,300
And now I know who your other partner is.

105
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,900
And you intend to get away from this bus.

106
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,700
A notebook?

107
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,000
"Do you have lipstick?"

108
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,300
Good.

109
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,100
Now to use this badge and get those guys to...

110
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,900
What can you do with one lipstick?

111
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,700
Show me your magic.

112
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,800
Cool guy.

113
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,500
Sato here.

114
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,800
The bus is presently

115
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,000
on the Chuo Freeway heading for the Otsuki direction.

116
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
We're almost at the Kobotoke Tunnel.

117
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,100
Continue tailing them. Don't lose them.

118
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,600
Yes, sir!

119
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,100
Listen carefully! The bus is nearly out of gas.

120
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,400
I'm certain the hijackers

121
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,100
will release three of the passengers as promised

122
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,600
when they stop for gas.

123
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,100
Contact the Yamanashi Prefectural Police

124
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,900
and ask them to place officers at all parking areas

125
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,900
the bus might stop at!

126
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,800
Yes, sir!

127
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,000
When the door opens,

128
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,500
we'll rush in, that's the best scenario.

129
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,800
Inspector! The bus is slowing down.

130
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,300
What?

131
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,900
The bus is now entering Kobotoke Tunnel.

132
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,000
Okay, you two!

133
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,900
Put these ski suits on and sit on the floor.

134
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,600
And don't forget these hats and goggles.

135
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,000
You're going to change places with us for awhile

136
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,800
and buy us some time.

137
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
We're going to disguise ourselves

138
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,000
as two of the released passengers and make our getaway

139
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,800
and you're going to buy us time to do that.

140
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,600
Don't worry. The other passengers will testify later

141
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,900
that you're not the hijackers.

142
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,600
And whether our escape is successful or not,

143
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,100
depends on you, driver! It's all in your hands.

144
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,500
When we get off the bus,

145
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,100
drive away and draw the police's attention to the bus.

146
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,200
And to make sure you follow our orders,

147
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,400
we're going to take one hostage with us.

148
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
That woman in the back chewing gum!

149
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,900
You, come here!

150
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,600
When we get to the end of the tunnel,

151
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,200
I'll give you the signal to speed up.

152
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,500
After the cop car following us is out of sight,

153
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,000
you stop the bus.

154
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,600
After we get off,

155
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,100
keep going until you run out of gas.

156
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,600
That's if you want this girl to stay alive.

157
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,000
Yes, I'll do it!

158
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,700
No, that's wrong.

159
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,000
She's no hostage.

160
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,400
She's one of them!

161
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,700
I was right.

162
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,300
After the three of them leave the bus,

163
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,100
they're going to detonate the bomb in these bags

164
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,900
killing us all so we can't testify as to what happened.

165
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,600
That's right.

166
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,200
They're going to be under police protection

167
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,900
because everyone will think they were really passengers

168
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,100
and they're going to make-up a story

169
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,700
about the whole thing.

170
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,600
And the police probably think

171
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,200
there were only two hijackers.

172
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,600
So if they say there was a struggle

173
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,900
between the passengers and the hijackers,

174
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,800
the police will believe that something happened

175
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,700
and the bomb went off killing everyone.

176
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,000
Which means

177
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,600
the bodies of Mr. Araide and the guy with the cold

178
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,300
will be found wearing ski suits

179
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,600
and the police will think that they were the hijackers.

180
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,200
They made them change in the tunnel

181
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,100
so that they couldn't be seen from the outside

182
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,900
but this darkness will work for me too.

183
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,700
Is that our badge?

184
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,900
Conan?

185
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,900
Ears...

186
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,600
Listen. Do exactly what I'm about to tell you.

187
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,900
Don't worry. The inside of the bus is dark

188
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,300
and they're so sure their plan is going to work,

189
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,000
their guard is down.

190
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,200
The moment the bus comes out of the tunnel,

191
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,500
that's when we make our move!

192
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,610
Okay! Speed up!

193
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,410
Okay.

194
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,110
Don't try anything stupid.

195
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,510
Just do what we tell you and you won't get killed.

196
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,910
What a liar!

197
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,310
What?

198
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,310
I know you're going to kill us.

199
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:58,010
Isn't that why you're letting us see your face?

200
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,510
Listen, everybody. If we don't do something,

201
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,710
they're going to kill us...

202
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,310
with this bomb!

203
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,910
You little brat!

204
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,110
I'll shut you up!

205
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,910
No, idiot! Don't shoot!

206
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,410
Huh? What is that red graffiti?

207
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,510
Hurry!

208
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,110
Huh?

209
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,110
Stop?

210
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,410
This way, mister!

211
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,610
Mitsuhiko, don't let go!

212
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,010
You don't have to tell me!

213
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,010
That hurts!

214
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,610
You little...

215
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,710
Mr. Araide!

216
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,910
Grab both that lady's arms!

217
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,310
Her wristwatch is

218
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,110
is the device that'll set off the bomb!

219
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,110
What?

220
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,710
Kid, you just made a big mistake!

221
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,510
I'm so sorry!

222
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,110
We braked so suddenly, I lost my balance...

223
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,310
Stop that.

224
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,710
What's wrong? The trigger...

225
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,610
You're so stupid.

226
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:07,110
Didn't you know that the safety on that type of gun lock

227
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,610
when you pull the hammer back lightly and stop it halfway.

228
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,010
You should have at least studied that

229
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:15,410
before you attempted to use it.

230
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,910
What the? Who the heck are you anyway?

231
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,810
It's a big secret.

232
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:26,310
I'm sorry, I can't tell you.

233
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:30,310
A secret makes a woman, a woman.

234
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:36,310
You surrender, huh?

235
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:44,010
We've got to get away from here right now!

236
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,510
When the bus skidded,

237
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,610
my wristwatch must've hit something.

238
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,610
The bomb's been activated!

239
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,610
There's less than a minute before it explodes!

240
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,110
Are you serious?

241
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,010
Inspector. The bus's in the Kobotoke Tunnel area.

242
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,210
They've come to a sudden stop and now there's no movement.

243
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:05,310
What should we do? Should we storm the bus?

244
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:09,010
No. Wait for your backup to arrive.

245
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,210
Huh?

246
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,710
Conan?

247
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,110
What happened?

248
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,910
The bomb those hijackers brought on the bus

249
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,310
is going to go off in less than 20 seconds!

250
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,210
-What? -We've go to do something!

251
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,810
I'll stop the cars at the tunnel.

252
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,610
Chiba, you go to the other lane!

253
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,510
You other men, help the passengers out of the bus!

254
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,010
Yes, madam!

255
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,110
Huh? Where's Ai?

256
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,110
I don't see her.

257
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,110
Don't tell me...

258
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,510
Is she really...

259
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,410
That is right. This is the best way.

260
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,310
Even if were saved,

261
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,510
I'd probably run into that person

262
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,310
when the police question us.

263
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,110
If I were to disappear right now,

264
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:09,910
then there'd be nothing left to link those guys with the organization.

265
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,710
I've always known that

266
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,910
from the moment I ran away from the organization,

267
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:21,410
there'd never be a place for me in society.

268
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,910
I'm such a fool.

269
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,110
I really am a fool, aren't I, sis?

270
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,310
Conan!

271
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,010
Conan!

272
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,410
Conan...

273
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,510
She's hurt!

274
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,910
Can you take her with Dr. Aqasa and the others to a hospital?

275
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,910
Huh?

276
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:20,210
I can answer all the police's questions by myself.

277
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,810
Okay.

278
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,610
There.

279
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:29,410
Don't run away, Haibara.

280
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,410
From your destiny...

281
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,010
Don't run away.

282
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,710
Get to the hospital, quickly!

283
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,010
Yes.

284
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,710
Oh, cool kid!

285
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:55,910
Breaking the window like that and rescuing the girl

286
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,910
was so James Bond!

287
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:03,110
Miss Jodie, you're more like Agent 007 than me.

288
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,010
You tripped the hijacker and pretended to apologize.

289
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,510
But actually, you put the safety on, on that gun, didn't you?

290
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,510
Oh, yes!

291
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,510
It went exactly like in the movies!

292
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,510
Oh, come on.

293
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,410
But you're very bright.

294
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:23,210
How did you know she was part of their gang?

295
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,910
It was the bubbles.

296
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,810
Bubbles?

297
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,810
She was chewing bubble gum.

298
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,010
That's how she was signaling the hijackers

299
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:37,210
which passenger was acting suspicious.

300
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,810
The bubble would break

301
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,810
and the hand she used to pull the gum off with

302
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,510
would show which seat that passenger was in.

303
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:53,210
Then how did you know her wristwatch would set off the bomb?

304
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:57,410
She was wearing a watch that had stopped at 1:00.

305
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,210
That made me suspicious.

306
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,310
I'm so mad though!

307
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:04,610
Their boss got away!

308
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:07,010
Don't worry.

309
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,410
The police wouldn't let a dangerous man like that

310
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,310
out of prison so easily. Not without a plan.

311
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,810
I'm sure he'll be captured right away.

312
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,810
Attention to all passengers!

313
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,410
We have some questions to ask all of you,

314
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,410
please get into the cars.

315
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,410
We've got to go, too.

316
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,410
You're pretty messed up.

317
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,310
Are you sure you're all right?

318
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,310
I'm fine, no problem.

319
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,410
I knew it! You've been hurt badly.

320
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,510
You're a very reckless boy.

321
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,710
Mr. Araide.

322
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,610
You can answer their questions after you've been treated.

323
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,210
All right.

324
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,710
Ai, does it hurt?

325
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,210
You're bleeding a lot from your leg.

326
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,710
I'm all right. That isn't my blood.

327
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,310
What?

328
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,610
That's right.

329
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:34,310
This is his blood. He put it on me

330
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,410
so that I'd be taken away from there.

331
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:41,610
It seems you've repaid your debt to me, Kudo.

332
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,210
Please get it quickly.

333
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,810
Unable to continue search
