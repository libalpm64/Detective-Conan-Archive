1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,460
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,160
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,960
An eerie case and a night train

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,060
are rushed on by the sound of the departure bell.

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,760
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,760
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,060
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:43,170
"Murder on the North Star Number Three (Part 1)"

9
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:53,670
Dear Mr. Kogoro Mouri, Ran and Conan,

10
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,670
how are you all doing?

11
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,270
I have somehow been able to get a hold of the tickets

12
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,570
for riding the North Star that I promised to get you.

13
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,370
I will be looking forward to seeing you all

14
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:06,170
-and so will Takeshi. -"And so will Takeshi.

15
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,170
Well, let's talk ourselves out after you arrive here.

16
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,170
Please enjoy your luxurious train ride to your hearts' content.

17
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,970
Natsue Hatamoto."

18
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,270
That is what she wrote.

19
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,070
She's the one who was involved

20
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,070
in the luxurious passenger liner incident, right?

21
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,470
After that, they left the Hatamoto residence

22
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,470
and began life on a ranch in Hokkaido.

23
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,370
How nostalgic...

24
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,470
We haven't seen them since that incident.

25
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,970
Well, I don't mean to brag,

26
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,470
but we get to ride on the royal suite of this North Star

27
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,370
thanks to the good work of the Sleeping Kogoro,

28
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,670
who solved the case!

29
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,870
Yes, we are very grateful and owe it all to you.

30
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,870
So long as you know!

31
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,270
This is the seventh time we're hearing this

32
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,670
since we boarded the train.

33
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,870
Anyway, I'm hungry.

34
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,670
Right.

35
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,570
It seems that Natsue has already dinner reservations for us, too.

36
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,270
So, why don't we head to the dining compartment?

37
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,970
It seems that the dining compartment is gorgeous, too!

38
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,970
Watch out, you idiot!

39
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,370
You are...

40
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,970
What? What's up?

41
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,670
Beats me...

42
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,470
Now, let's go eat!

43
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,370
I heard that it's a full course French cuisine!

44
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,770
Oh, really?

45
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:40,170
Just splendid having French cuisine in a train.

46
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,870
You can say that again.

47
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,270
Darn it. It's Kogoro Mouri.

48
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,670
"Yasuji Asama (39)" -They didn't tell me he was going to be around.

49
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,470
Gosh, I am so full!

50
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,870
It sure was delicious.

51
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,670
The food is good, the room is gorgeous...

52
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,370
We couldn't possibly ask for anything more.

53
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,770
What's with that rabbit hut?

54
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,270
I told you to reserve the royal suite, didn't I?

55
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,070
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,070
"Toshinori Kaetsu (38)" -But, owner, you mentioned that you wanted

57
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,370
to ride North Star only a week ago.

58
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,370
Being a very popular train,

59
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,570
we were lucky that we got the number

60
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,270
of individual compartments we needed.

61
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,970
"Keitaro Izumo (56)" -Just to think that I got stay in a room

62
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,370
that ranks the same as yours...

63
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,670
My wifes locked up in her room saying

64
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,170
she doesn't want anyone to see her taking a trip in a room like this!

65
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,370
That's why you should've taken a plane...

66
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,470
Shut up!

67
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,670
I wanted to go to tomorrow's auction on this train!

68
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,470
Excuse me.

69
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,070
Haven't I met you before?

70
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,570
I'm sure you've seen him on TV or in the papers.

71
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,470
Our jewelry shop was robbed the other day

72
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,270
and he was interviewed by various press people.

73
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,270
Oh, I see!

74
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,770
The one who got rid of the robber all by himself...

75
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,170
Was there such an incident?

76
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,770
Remember, the evening of the day that you went camping

77
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,870
with your friends.

78
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,370
It was no big deal.

79
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,870
The robber fled as soon as I shouted aloud

80
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,370
and rang the burglar alarm. That's all it was.

81
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:11,070
But everybody was surprised at how brave you were!

82
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,670
All the fuss for something like that...

83
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,770
But it was good advertisement for you, wasn't it?

84
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,570
"Akishige Ishizuchi (67)" -For you running as mayor...

85
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,170
in the next election.

86
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,970
You've got it made.

87
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,370
Mayor Ishizuchi? What brings you here?

88
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,670
I'm going on a short vacation to Hokkaido.

89
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,370
And what do you mean by he's got it made?

90
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,470
It's just a rumor.

91
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,870
There's a rumor going around

92
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,670
that the owner conjured up the robbery

93
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,670
in order to gather votes for the next election.

94
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,270
It's just groundless rumor.

95
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,470
But like they say, where there's no smoke there's no fire.

96
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,770
Hey.

97
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,070
But the one who was caught by the surveillance camera back then

98
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,070
was a professional robber with a record, wasn't he?

99
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,370
It couldn't possibly have been set up...

100
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,670
All more the reason to suspect him.

101
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,870
It's hard to believe that such a professional

102
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,070
would raid a place without checking it out first,

103
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,170
let the alarm go off and flee without taking anything.

104
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,270
That's not enough evidence to suspect the owner, is it?

105
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,970
That's not the only thing.

106
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,970
Huh?

107
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,170
The employees seem to have heard

108
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,670
the robber say something strange before he flee.

109
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,670
Something strange?

110
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:25,970
The robber seems to have said bitterly just before he fled,

111
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,370
"Nobody told me."

112
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,770
Is that true?

113
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,770
Yes, I heard the robber say something like that, too.

114
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,070
-If so, something smells fishy. -Wasn't there a similar incident...

115
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,170
-Just what do you think you're saying? -some time ago?

116
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,470
Who on earth are you anyway?

117
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,070
What? You don't know me?

118
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,870
Actually, I am none other than...

119
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,070
Kogoro Mouri.

120
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,670
You are, aren't you?

121
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,670
Yes.

122
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,670
"Toru Aoba (32)"

123
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,970
How lucky

124
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,470
to run into the renown detective Mr. Kogoro Mouri

125
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,070
in a place like this!

126
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,470
May I take a picture together with you later?

127
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,870
Yes.

128
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,070
Mouri...

129
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,870
Kogoro?

130
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,970
Seriously, coincidences can be so frightening.

131
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,470
Oh, you're Ms. Akechi who made reservations for dinner?

132
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,870
Your seat is that way.

133
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,370
I'm sorry, but I'm canceling my dinner.

134
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,870
Ms. Akechi?

135
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,970
"Fumiyo Akechi (37)"

136
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,470
Seems like it's going to be an interesting trip.

137
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,570
Hey, I'm pretty sure that there was an incident

138
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,270
where the robber fled without taking anything.

139
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,670
I don't know of any.

140
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:48,270
You must've watched a suspense drama something like that recently.

141
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,670
No, not recently.

142
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,270
But a long time ago.

143
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,070
I'm sure it was when I was still a kid.

144
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,070
Look, we've entered the Seikan Tunnel!

145
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,570
What's with you guys? Are you still awake?

146
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,670
Hey, it's already 4:00 am.

147
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,570
That's enough. Go to bed right now.

148
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,370
Darn it. I can't remember.

149
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,370
I'm sure I ran into that incident somewhere.

150
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,770
An incident really similar to the recent one.

151
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,870
Somewhere...

152
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,270
The sound of gun shot and screams

153
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,270
washed out the roar within the tunnel.

154
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,670
What was that?

155
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,670
What was that scream about?

156
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,070
Did you hear anything strange before this happened?

157
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,970
I'm sure it was gun fire.

158
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,670
Somebody was shot with a gun.

159
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:18,170
Idiot! We won't know it unless we go look!

160
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,870
That's true.

161
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:25,370
The man ran through the aisle as if he were a starved beast...

162
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,070
Not again.

163
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,770
Darn it! What's is this that I keep on hearing?

164
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,270
Hey, you...

165
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,770
It's a murder!

166
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,970
He shot a man...

167
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,570
What?

168
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,770
What the...

169
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,070
But the man was no longer anywhere in sight...

170
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,670
I won't let you get away!

171
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,770
Darn it. We're too late.

172
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:06,970
The wind and the sound of the train played their clamorous tune...

173
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,070
-Hey, stop the train right away... -I see.

174
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,670
-and get the police! -It's the novel.

175
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,070
Yes, sir!

176
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,070
This is just like the plot of that novel.

177
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,770
The one that Dad wrote a long time ago.

178
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,470
The novel that never came to light.

179
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,360
According to the driver's license

180
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,160
and name card the victim had on him,

181
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,460
he is Keitaro Izumo, age 56, a resident Furuichi City in Tokyo.

182
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,060
He seems to be the owner of a large jewelry store.

183
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,560
He was shot to death, right?

184
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,160
Yes. According to witnesses,

185
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,860
the killer came suddenly from behind the victim

186
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,360
and shot him.

187
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,660
It's obvious.

188
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,160
And what did the killer do after that?

189
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,760
He fled that way.

190
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,760
The conductor ran right after him, but...

191
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,560
He lost track of the killer

192
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,560
who ran past in front of my room,

193
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,560
fired at the window of his room and cracked it,

194
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,760
and fled outside from there!

195
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,760
Who are you?

196
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,360
Huh? You don't know me?

197
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,560
I thought you looked familiar...

198
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,360
You're the sleeping Kogoro, the renown Detective, Kogoro Mouri.

199
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,560
What?

200
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,460
You mean that cursed one who causes disastrous incidents

201
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,960
wherever he goes?

202
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,960
I wonder what kind of rumor is going around?

203
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,960
And? Are you the only one who saw the killer get away?

204
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,860
No, three of us.

205
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,060
Me, my daughter, Ran here and the other one is...

206
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,660
Huh? That brat's not around?

207
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,360
He was here just a while ago.

208
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,660
-Gosh, where did he go? -Conan?

209
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,560
Everything is exactly the same.

210
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,060
The strange remark made by the robber

211
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,760
and the shooting that occurs Mithin the train after that.

212
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,660
Everything synchronizes with that story.

213
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,960
The one that I read when I was a kid.

214
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,860
My Dad's novel that hasn't been published yet.

215
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,260
Darn it!

216
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,060
I only remember it vaguely because I was only a kid.

217
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,860
I thought I'd be able to get some hints from Dad.

218
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,660
I wonder where he is at a time like this...

219
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,260
Oh, Conan! There you are!

220
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,860
You shouldn't go skittering here and there.

221
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,260
I'm sorry.

222
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,660
Come, the police officer wants you.

223
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,960
Okay.

224
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,160
So, like I've been telling you...

225
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,560
The killer came running like this.

226
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,560
Then, he opened the door to his room,

227
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,860
fired his gun, cracked the window,

228
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:07,360
and fled outside after he fired twice at me.

229
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,060
But you didn't actually see the killer flee out of the window, right?

230
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,660
Well, not really...

231
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,960
And besides, would a killer normally throw his gun out in the room

232
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,260
and flee?

233
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,760
He fired six shots within the train.

234
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,560
There are still some bullets left.

235
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,360
It could be that while you were down after firing at you,

236
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,860
he fled into another room.

237
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,060
It couldn't be!

238
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:39,160
The killer closed the door just before I got here!

239
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,860
Maybe it just looked that way to you?

240
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,860
What?

241
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,860
The lights of the corridor were dimmed,

242
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,460
and you seemed to be excited because you were fired at, too.

243
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,860
Come on, inspector.

244
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,260
That's true.

245
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,060
It's true that he closed the door back then.

246
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,860
But the inspector has a point, too.

247
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,360
It's also true

248
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,960
that we didn't actually see the killer flee out of the window.

249
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,460
Besides, it's unnatural for a killer on the run

250
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,960
to leave his gun behind.

251
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,360
Moreover,

252
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,160
why didn't the killer lock the door when he closed the door?

253
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,660
He could buy more time that way for sure.

254
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,960
And the greatest mystery is,

255
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,860
why this incident has the same plot as that novel?

256
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,060
Anyway, he could have fled into someone's room.

257
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,960
Shall we check all the rooms around here?

258
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,960
I guess I'll start checking from this room next door.

259
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,560
Yes.

260
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,460
I wonder if it's vacant?

261
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,060
It's so noisy!

262
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,460
Do you know what time is it?

263
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,260
I beg your pardon, I'm Inspector Nishimura

264
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,660
from the Hokkaido Police Department.

265
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:59,260
There's been a bit of an incident within this train.

266
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,260
An incident?

267
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,660
You mean you didn't notice a thing

268
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,660
with all that racket going on next door?

269
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,760
"Azusa Izumo (49)" -How should I know? I was fast a sleep.

270
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,260
Nevermind that. What is this incident that you're talking about?

271
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,960
Oh, well...

272
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,160
What's up?

273
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,060
A person was shot to death.

274
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,460
Mr. Keitaro Izumo, the owner of a jewelry store was killed

275
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,660
in the lobby on board this train!

276
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,060
-What? -What? It can't be!

277
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,460
Why? Why was my husband killed?

278
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,460
Your husband?

279
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,260
Anyway, please move so that I can search your room.

280
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,660
Mrs. Izumo, may I open this?

281
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,460
Yes. But who on earth killed my husband?

282
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,860
That's what we're investigating on now.

283
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,260
But...

284
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,460
Isn't this a shot gun?

285
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,160
Yes, I use it for clay shooting, my hobby.

286
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,060
I was planning to use it in Hokkaido.

287
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,860
Nobody's seems to be in here.

288
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,260
Yes, sir.

289
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,260
Let me check your room next.

290
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,060
-Yes. -Inspector!

291
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,460
Please... please let me see my husband!

292
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,960
Please calm down, Mrs. Izumo.

293
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,560
It's over here.

294
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,860
What is that long bag over there?

295
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,760
Oh, it's a fishing kit.

296
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,560
Unlike his wife, the owner liked lure fishing.

297
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,260
I used to carry his bag around for him.

298
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,460
I see.

299
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,860
Next is the room right across.

300
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,060
That's the owner's room.

301
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,760
No one suspicious in here.

302
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,960
And next is this room with the stairs between it.

303
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,560
Darn it! What's with all these guys?

304
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,860
Hey, this is the police! Open up!

305
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,360
What is it?

306
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,960
Police. I would like to see your room.

307
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,160
Come in.

308
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,360
What is that on top of the bed?

309
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,160
It's a bamboo sword.

310
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,660
I was fixing it because it was coming apart.

311
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,760
I'm going to participate in a kendo match in Sapporo tomorrow.

312
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,860
Is anything wrong?

313
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,760
Well, sort of...

314
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,060
Darn it! We're getting nowhere!

315
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,160
Dispatch all the officers and check out all the rooms!

316
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,960
-Yes, sir! -What's all this commotion?

317
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,960
I'm completely sober now.

318
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,560
Where is your room?

319
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,260
Upstairs.

320
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,660
Excuse me!

321
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,960
Hey...

322
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,460
What's with you? Barging into my room like that...

323
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,360
It's just a golf bag.

324
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,760
Hey! You'd better cut it out or I'll call the police!

325
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,660
I am a police officer! Got any problem with that?

326
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,760
Did you find the killer?

327
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,960
If he could be found so easily, we wouldn't be having problems.

328
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,260
Come to think of it, there was a suspicious looking woman

329
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,060
in the lobby until just before the incident.

330
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,060
A woman?

331
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,060
Yes, she was wearing sunglasses

332
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,260
and seemed to be shooting glances at the person who was shot.

333
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,560
Could that have been me?

334
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,560
-It's her. -What?

335
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,160
I left the lobby to go to the restroom.

336
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,060
I was shooting glances at him

337
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,860
because the smell of his tobacco bothered me.

338
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,560
Excuse me, but where is your room?

339
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,360
Over here.

340
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,460
Oh, is that shoulder bag your only luggage?

341
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,560
Yes. Because I'm just going to Hokkaido to go horseback riding.

342
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,160
Horseback riding?

343
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,560
Oh, I've seen that before!

344
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,060
When you ride the horse,

345
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:43,460
you have to wear a helmet and a strange pair of slacks, right?

346
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,160
A culotte? Of course!

347
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,660
You're doing the works!

348
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,060
Of course, sonny.

349
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,360
Then, do you get rid of the dirty stuff (boro) by yourself, too?

350
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,660
Yes, I go and buy myself a new one on my own.

351
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,760
Including the gloves and boots, too.

352
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,360
Excuse me. The passengers are beginning to make a fuss.

353
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,760
We've got to start heading the train for the station.

354
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,960
No, no!

355
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,460
Don't move the train until we finish checking all the rooms.

356
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,360
We don't want the killer throwing evidence out of the window.

357
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,860
If so, maybe you should hurry and start searching inside the tunnel.

358
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,360
We've already started to!

359
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,160
Inspector Nishimura! In the tunnel...

360
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,960
We've found the body of a dead man in the tunnel.

361
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,060
What?

362
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,260
He seems to have hit his head hard.

363
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,560
He must have fell the wrong way when he fled out the window.

364
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,660
What an idiot.

365
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,060
Is this the man you saw?

366
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,160
-Yes. -I think so.

367
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,160
What's this?

368
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,760
Fake beard?

369
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,860
He's...

370
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,460
Yasuji Asama?

371
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,760
Hey, hey.

372
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,560
Isn't Yasuji Asama the one who...

373
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,160
Yes. The professional robber who raided the jewelry shop in Tokyo

374
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,860
and fled without taking a thing.

375
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,860
They seem to have been working together as a group of three,

376
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,960
but ever since one of the members died of dope,

377
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,760
they've been really quiet.

378
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,160
I was thinking that he goofed it

379
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,360
because it had been a long time since he did his last job.

380
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,860
But I didn't think I would meet him here.

381
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,260
Just a minute.

382
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,960
The one who was killed in the train

383
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,360
was the owner of the jewelry shop

384
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,360
that was robbed by Asama the other day!

385
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,460
What?

386
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,660
Something does smell fishy here.

387
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,360
Well, all is well.

388
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,560
Although he is dead, we've nabbed the killer.

389
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,960
Tell the conductor to start the train as usual.

390
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,260
Yes, sir!

391
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,160
The phone you have reached is not accessible

392
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,060
or switched off and cannot be connected.

393
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,660
Please call back later.

394
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,460
The phone you have reached is not accessible...

395
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,560
Hey.

396
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,560
Hi, sonny.

397
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,160
Did you want to talk to me?

398
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,560
Yes. I was amazed

399
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,060
at how well you disguised yourself.

400
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,060
You were lying about going horseback riding, weren't you?

401
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:42,360
You got on board this train for another reason, didn't you?

402
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,660
Just what're you talking about, sonny?

403
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,460
I'm really going horseback riding.

404
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,660
Idiot.

405
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,660
The dirty stuff (boro) that I was referring to a while ago

406
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,060
means horse dung.

407
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,760
You can't possibly be horseback riding

408
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,160
while not knowing something like that.

409
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,760
So, go ahead and reveal your true identity.

410
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,560
You've been busted already.

411
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,560
Lady.

412
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,760
"Next Episode" -You saw something strange?

413
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,960
It was a little before the incident occurred.

414
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,660
I wonder whose this is?

415
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,360
Wait a second.

416
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,260
If an object that shape were to be there...

417
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,860
If it were to be there...

418
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,560
I found it. There it is!

419
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,860
Next Conan,

420
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:16,580
"Murder on the North Star Number Three (Part 2)"

421
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,870
Next Conan's Hint:

422
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,670
"Costume for disguise"

423
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,570
Next, the trip and the case both come to close.

424
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:26,170
Those two are coming, Conan.
