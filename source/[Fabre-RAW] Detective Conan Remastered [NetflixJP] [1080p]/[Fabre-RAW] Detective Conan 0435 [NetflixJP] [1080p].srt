1
00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:04,133
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:06,033
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:07,433
Somebody wants to interview the Youth Detective Squad.

4
00:00:07,433 --> 00:00:08,933
They are excited at becoming the center of attention.

5
00:00:08,933 --> 00:00:10,633
But a crime is committed!

6
00:00:10,633 --> 00:00:12,133
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:13,833
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,833
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,802
"Teitan Elementary"

10
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:15,902
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

11
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,902
I apologize for coming at a time when you're so busy.

12
00:02:18,902 --> 00:02:20,102
No problem.

13
00:02:20,102 --> 00:02:22,102
I am...

14
00:02:22,102 --> 00:02:23,302
As you can see on my name card.

15
00:02:23,302 --> 00:02:25,802
"Free Writer, Masato Sugimori"

16
00:02:27,802 --> 00:02:32,402
I'm Sumiko Kobayashi, homeroom teacher for 1st grade, Class B.

17
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,502
Please have a seat.

18
00:02:35,102 --> 00:02:36,902
So you're a freelance writer.

19
00:02:37,902 --> 00:02:39,402
Yes, I am.

20
00:02:39,402 --> 00:02:45,102
I thought my name is recently gaining popularity in women's magazines,

21
00:02:45,102 --> 00:02:47,502
but I guess, it's not as much as I thought.

22
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:48,602
It's not that.

23
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:51,202
I don't read magazines much, that's why.

24
00:02:51,202 --> 00:02:53,002
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:54,502
Please don't get upset over it.

26
00:02:54,502 --> 00:02:57,002
It doesn't bother me at all.

27
00:02:57,002 --> 00:03:01,002
And, what is it that you want?

28
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:04,402
If you want an interview on bullying or something like that,

29
00:03:04,402 --> 00:03:07,202
no such thing exists in my class.

30
00:03:07,202 --> 00:03:08,802
Nothing like that.

31
00:03:08,802 --> 00:03:11,202
What I want is to interview

32
00:03:11,202 --> 00:03:14,102
the members of the Youth Detective Squad in your class.

33
00:03:14,102 --> 00:03:17,102
Huh? Youth Detective Squad?

34
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:20,002
You mean the thing that Kojima and his friends have formed?

35
00:03:20,002 --> 00:03:21,402
Yeah...

36
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:25,202
Yeah. I've heard rumours of what those children have done so far.

37
00:03:25,202 --> 00:03:30,402
But the group is something that the children formed on their own.

38
00:03:31,902 --> 00:03:35,002
In reality, they simply look for lost cats and so on.

39
00:03:35,002 --> 00:03:38,002
Hey! Minami! Megumi! Ai!

40
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:40,402
The names all sound familiar.

41
00:03:40,402 --> 00:03:43,202
The three cats are said to be violent.

42
00:03:43,202 --> 00:03:46,202
But I was informed by the police

43
00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:49,702
that they have contributed a lot to solving homicides

44
00:03:49,702 --> 00:03:53,502
especially a boy called Conan Edogawa.

45
00:03:53,502 --> 00:03:55,202
Conan?

46
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:56,902
I see.

47
00:03:56,902 --> 00:03:59,402
The title of the interview will be,

48
00:03:59,402 --> 00:04:02,802
"The Youth Detective Squad of the 21st Century!"

49
00:04:02,802 --> 00:04:05,402
I'm sure it'll attract a lot of attention.

50
00:04:08,802 --> 00:04:10,802
Well, I'm not sure...

51
00:04:13,102 --> 00:04:18,902
"The Youth Detective Squad is Interviewed (Part 1)"

52
00:04:18,902 --> 00:04:21,002
"1st grade Class B" -What...

53
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:22,402
An interview?

54
00:04:22,402 --> 00:04:25,102
Us, the Youth Detective Squad?

55
00:04:25,102 --> 00:04:26,202
Cool!

56
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:29,302
That's right!

57
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:30,502
Yesterday after school,

58
00:04:30,502 --> 00:04:34,102
a writer called Mr. Sugimori came here to see me.

59
00:04:34,102 --> 00:04:37,202
He said that he'd like to write an article about all of you

60
00:04:37,202 --> 00:04:38,802
and asked me to help him out.

61
00:04:40,002 --> 00:04:41,702
It sounds interesting!

62
00:04:41,702 --> 00:04:43,802
I'm getting excited!

63
00:04:43,802 --> 00:04:45,402
So...

64
00:04:49,702 --> 00:04:52,002
Do you have a cold, Ms. Kobayashi?

65
00:04:52,002 --> 00:04:53,602
Not good.

66
00:04:53,602 --> 00:04:54,802
It seems so.

67
00:04:54,802 --> 00:04:56,602
Although I still don't have a fever,

68
00:04:56,602 --> 00:05:00,002
my nose keeps running and I can't stop sneezing.

69
00:05:00,002 --> 00:05:02,402
Are you all right, Ms. Kobayashi?

70
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,702
Did you take any medicine?

71
00:05:03,702 --> 00:05:07,302
Aren't your eyes itchy?

72
00:05:07,302 --> 00:05:08,402
Right, right.

73
00:05:08,402 --> 00:05:11,202
I was correcting tests until late last night.

74
00:05:11,202 --> 00:05:12,902
I guess my eyes got tired.

75
00:05:12,902 --> 00:05:14,802
You've got hay fever.

76
00:05:14,802 --> 00:05:17,202
What? No way!

77
00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:18,402
No, I don't.

78
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:21,602
Because I've had immunity against things like that since childhood.

79
00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:23,002
You see,

80
00:05:23,002 --> 00:05:25,202
hay fever occurs when the antigen,

81
00:05:25,202 --> 00:05:29,302
in other words, the substance that causes the allergy enters the body

82
00:05:29,302 --> 00:05:32,102
and antibodies are created to fight off the antigens are made.

83
00:05:32,102 --> 00:05:36,502
They accumulate within the body and when they exceed a certain level,

84
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,802
the antigens and antibodies react

85
00:05:38,802 --> 00:05:42,802
and a substance that causes allergy is dispersed.

86
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:45,802
But because the antigen-carrying pollen

87
00:05:45,802 --> 00:05:49,002
is limited to being formed only one time a year,

88
00:05:49,002 --> 00:05:52,102
it takes quite a long time before they accumulate.

89
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,302
So even if there's no allergy when you were a child,

90
00:05:54,302 --> 00:05:58,702
there are many cases of people becoming allergic in their 20's and 30's.

91
00:05:58,702 --> 00:06:00,902
Oh, is that so?

92
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,902
And? What about the interview?

93
00:06:03,902 --> 00:06:05,302
Of course we'll accept it!

94
00:06:05,302 --> 00:06:09,202
We, as the Youth Detective Squad should accept it, right?

95
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,402
Yes!

96
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:16,302
It looks like it's going to rain.

97
00:06:16,302 --> 00:06:18,602
They sure are late.

98
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:22,302
They're the ones who said we'd meet up 30 minutes beforehand.

99
00:06:22,302 --> 00:06:23,302
Listen!

100
00:06:23,302 --> 00:06:26,402
30 minutes beforehand. That's when we meet, okay?

101
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:27,902
Don't be late!

102
00:06:27,902 --> 00:06:29,702
Understand, Conan?

103
00:06:29,702 --> 00:06:31,902
Me?

104
00:06:31,902 --> 00:06:33,902
Yeah, I got it.

105
00:06:33,902 --> 00:06:37,102
Really? I hope you keep your word, Genta.

106
00:06:37,902 --> 00:06:40,602
Of course I will.

107
00:06:40,602 --> 00:06:41,802
Come on.

108
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:44,002
Dress normally tomorrow, you guys.

109
00:06:44,002 --> 00:06:47,402
He have to see us as we usually are as the Youth Detective Squad.

110
00:06:47,402 --> 00:06:49,402
You sure are smart!

111
00:06:49,402 --> 00:06:51,202
I'm giving it my best shot!

112
00:06:53,302 --> 00:06:55,702
Hey, Conan!

113
00:06:55,702 --> 00:06:57,502
Sorry to keep you waiting!

114
00:06:57,502 --> 00:06:59,302
Thanks for waiting!

115
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:01,602
Sorry, Conan! Did you wait long?

116
00:07:01,602 --> 00:07:03,502
Hey! You guys are late.

117
00:07:03,502 --> 00:07:05,202
Just what do you think you're doing?

118
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:09,202
Ayumi was taking her good old time getting ready, that's why.

119
00:07:09,202 --> 00:07:12,302
Well, I had a lot of things to do.

120
00:07:12,302 --> 00:07:13,602
No big deal.

121
00:07:13,602 --> 00:07:15,202
After all, she's a girl.

122
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:17,502
So let's not make a fuss over it.

123
00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:19,902
I guess I've got no choice.

124
00:07:19,902 --> 00:07:22,302
By the way, where's Haibara?

125
00:07:22,302 --> 00:07:25,002
I'm right here.

126
00:07:25,002 --> 00:07:26,602
Since when was she there?

127
00:07:26,602 --> 00:07:29,702
Anyway, what's with you guys? This isn't what we talked about!

128
00:07:29,702 --> 00:07:31,202
How come you're all dressed like that?

129
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,802
How do you like it?

130
00:07:36,002 --> 00:07:37,602
Well, it's an interview after all, isn't it?

131
00:07:37,602 --> 00:07:39,002
Right, Mitsuhiko?

132
00:07:39,002 --> 00:07:43,602
Yes. We should be properly dressed for an interview,

133
00:07:43,602 --> 00:07:46,502
because a lot of people will be watching.

134
00:07:46,502 --> 00:07:49,002
Yes, yes, exactly!

135
00:07:54,502 --> 00:07:57,102
Oh, boy. Why does it have to turn out this way?

136
00:07:57,102 --> 00:08:01,102
We're heading for an interview and it starts raining.

137
00:08:01,102 --> 00:08:03,302
God is sure mean.

138
00:08:03,302 --> 00:08:04,802
Really.

139
00:08:04,802 --> 00:08:07,502
It was so sunshiny yesterday.

140
00:08:07,502 --> 00:08:09,002
Why is this happening today?

141
00:08:09,002 --> 00:08:12,602
Mitsuhiko, this is your fault for telling us to dress normally.

142
00:08:12,602 --> 00:08:14,702
What? What are you talking about?

143
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,402
Talk for yourself, Genta!

144
00:08:16,402 --> 00:08:20,802
My Sunday clothes are soaking wet with rain.

145
00:08:20,802 --> 00:08:24,102
My shoes are all wet, too.

146
00:08:24,102 --> 00:08:26,602
And I just bought them last night.

147
00:08:26,602 --> 00:08:29,702
I think you guys are taking things a bit too far.

148
00:08:32,502 --> 00:08:34,002
I guess it's no big deal.

149
00:08:34,002 --> 00:08:38,502
We can ask them to lend us a dryer or something before the interview.

150
00:08:38,502 --> 00:08:41,502
We're being interviewed at the house of the writer, aren't we?

151
00:08:41,502 --> 00:08:45,102
But recent televisions are high definition,

152
00:08:45,102 --> 00:08:48,802
so if shots of us entering the house with rain stains are taken...

153
00:08:48,802 --> 00:08:51,102
What? Are television cameras coming, too?

154
00:08:53,202 --> 00:08:56,402
Hey, hey. Of course they're not coming.

155
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:59,502
Maybe we're going to be aired on a special program?

156
00:08:59,502 --> 00:09:03,102
Which means that beautiful women announcers will be there, too.

157
00:09:03,102 --> 00:09:06,202
I want to be interviewed by Reina Mizunashi!

158
00:09:06,202 --> 00:09:07,302
Me, too!

159
00:09:08,302 --> 00:09:10,802
She won't be coming, right?

160
00:09:10,802 --> 00:09:14,102
Because she's in the hospital right now.

161
00:09:14,102 --> 00:09:15,102
Yeah.

162
00:09:15,102 --> 00:09:17,902
It seems that the announcer who is a member of the Black Organization

163
00:09:17,902 --> 00:09:20,202
is still lying unconscious.

164
00:09:21,302 --> 00:09:22,602
Hey.

165
00:09:22,602 --> 00:09:25,802
Don't tell me that this interview is their plan?

166
00:09:25,802 --> 00:09:27,702
It can't be.

167
00:09:27,702 --> 00:09:29,802
No matter how you think about it,

168
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,902
inviting five kids to your house will attract attention.

169
00:09:31,902 --> 00:09:34,802
It's hard to believe that they would go out of their way

170
00:09:34,802 --> 00:09:37,802
to do something like leaving clues behind.

171
00:09:37,802 --> 00:09:42,102
They do things so that no one notices what they're doing, right?

172
00:09:42,102 --> 00:09:43,902
Yes, that's true.

173
00:09:46,102 --> 00:09:49,402
Besides, if they want to do something to you or me,

174
00:09:49,402 --> 00:09:51,702
they wouldn't be calling adults over.

175
00:09:51,702 --> 00:09:52,902
Sorry, sorry!

176
00:09:55,202 --> 00:09:57,502
Did you all wait long?

177
00:09:57,502 --> 00:09:59,602
Ms. Kobayashi?

178
00:09:59,602 --> 00:10:01,502
She sure looks like Officer Sato.

179
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:03,802
What is it?

180
00:10:03,802 --> 00:10:05,202
Hey...

181
00:10:05,202 --> 00:10:07,302
You forgot your glasses.

182
00:10:07,302 --> 00:10:08,902
Oh, this?

183
00:10:08,902 --> 00:10:11,602
I decided to wear contact lens today for a change.

184
00:10:11,602 --> 00:10:12,602
How do you like it?

185
00:10:12,602 --> 00:10:15,102
Not good? You don't like it?

186
00:10:15,102 --> 00:10:16,802
You look just great!

187
00:10:16,802 --> 00:10:20,202
Your outfit is feminine and nice, too.

188
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,102
You look way prettier than usual, Ms. Kobayashi.

189
00:10:23,102 --> 00:10:25,602
Thank you! I'm glad.

190
00:10:25,602 --> 00:10:29,102
Well, it seems like the writer is good-looking.

191
00:10:29,102 --> 00:10:31,202
No, that's not it.

192
00:10:31,202 --> 00:10:33,202
Really, it's nothing like that.

193
00:10:33,202 --> 00:10:36,702
But I think you shouldn't have worn contact lens.

194
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,502
Your eyes are itchy from your hay fever,

195
00:10:38,502 --> 00:10:41,202
so being irritated by the contacts isn't good for them.

196
00:10:42,602 --> 00:10:43,802
Okay, okay.

197
00:10:43,802 --> 00:10:46,902
I'll be fine if I wear my glasses, right?

198
00:10:46,902 --> 00:10:49,202
Yeah. That's way better.

199
00:10:49,202 --> 00:10:53,002
It seems that not much pollen is in the air now because it's raining.

200
00:10:53,002 --> 00:10:57,402
But the house of the writer may be full of pollen.

201
00:10:57,402 --> 00:11:01,002
And you'd better dust that hairy decoration off

202
00:11:01,002 --> 00:11:03,302
before going into the house,

203
00:11:03,302 --> 00:11:06,602
so that you don't scatter pollen all over the house.

204
00:11:06,602 --> 00:11:07,702
I guess so.

205
00:11:07,702 --> 00:11:08,802
Okay.

206
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:12,402
Ms. Kobayashi, was that writer handsome?

207
00:11:13,302 --> 00:11:17,302
Yes, his looks weren't all that bad.

208
00:11:20,102 --> 00:11:23,002
He's friendly and easy to talk to.

209
00:11:23,002 --> 00:11:26,702
I'm sure you'll be able to get along with him pretty quickly.

210
00:11:26,702 --> 00:11:30,302
He's famous for his experience in writing for women's magazines,

211
00:11:30,302 --> 00:11:34,202
so I'm sure he's used to coping with children, too.

212
00:11:34,202 --> 00:11:35,902
He's famous.

213
00:11:35,902 --> 00:11:37,302
He's famous?

214
00:11:37,302 --> 00:11:40,802
Which means that he must live in an incredibly huge mansion!

215
00:11:40,802 --> 00:11:44,302
He must have his very own chef and patissier, too.

216
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:47,002
I'm sure he'll serve us a fantastic dinner then.

217
00:11:47,002 --> 00:11:48,302
I know he will!

218
00:11:49,602 --> 00:11:50,802
Well...

219
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:54,602
I don't think so.

220
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:00,202
Here?

221
00:12:01,402 --> 00:12:03,102
I guess so.

222
00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:05,702
It's not a mansion.

223
00:12:05,702 --> 00:12:08,502
But an ordinary apartment.

224
00:12:10,602 --> 00:12:12,502
I guess there'll be no television cameras...

225
00:12:12,502 --> 00:12:14,602
Or beautiful women announcers.

226
00:12:17,202 --> 00:12:18,702
Well, all for the better.

227
00:12:18,702 --> 00:12:21,802
This way you can talk without getting nervous, right?

228
00:12:21,802 --> 00:12:24,002
Hey. Did the writer say

229
00:12:24,002 --> 00:12:27,202
that he was really going to interview us at his house?

230
00:12:27,202 --> 00:12:30,602
It looks to be a small one room six mats house.

231
00:12:30,602 --> 00:12:33,302
No. He said he'd conduct the interview at a family restaurant close by.

232
00:12:33,302 --> 00:12:34,702
Oh, no!

233
00:12:34,702 --> 00:12:38,002
I'm supposed to call him from the bus stop near his house!

234
00:12:38,002 --> 00:12:39,502
Just as I thought.

235
00:12:39,502 --> 00:12:41,302
I've got to call him right away.

236
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,702
No need to.

237
00:12:42,702 --> 00:12:44,002
We've come all the way here.

238
00:12:44,002 --> 00:12:47,702
We may as well be interviewed at his house and get it over with quickly.

239
00:12:47,702 --> 00:12:48,702
I guess so.

240
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:50,602
You need to get it together.

241
00:12:53,102 --> 00:12:56,102
I wonder if he'd be surprised at seeing all of us at once like this.

242
00:12:56,102 --> 00:12:57,302
He might be.

243
00:12:57,302 --> 00:12:58,902
Stay quiet, okay?

244
00:13:04,302 --> 00:13:06,502
I wonder if he's out?

245
00:13:06,502 --> 00:13:10,402
No. The morning paper is stuck in the slot, maybe he's still asleep.

246
00:13:12,202 --> 00:13:14,002
The door isn't locked.

247
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,302
Hey, Genta!

248
00:13:21,402 --> 00:13:22,402
Mr. Sugimori?

249
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,902
No, Ms. Kobayashi! Don't go inside!

250
00:13:24,902 --> 00:13:27,102
Since you're acquainted with him,

251
00:13:27,102 --> 00:13:29,702
if your hair or anything is found in this room,

252
00:13:29,702 --> 00:13:31,302
you could end up becoming a suspect, right?

253
00:13:38,702 --> 00:13:41,802
Please call an ambulance and the police immediately, Ms. Kobayashi!

254
00:13:41,802 --> 00:13:45,102
If we call, they may think it's a child's prank.

255
00:13:46,402 --> 00:13:47,602
Okay.

256
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:50,802
No. There's no need to call an ambulance.

257
00:13:50,802 --> 00:13:53,402
His body is completely stiff.

258
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:55,302
He's been dead for half a day already.

259
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:57,202
Stiff?

260
00:13:57,202 --> 00:13:58,702
Dead for half a day?

261
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:04,902
This could be...

262
00:14:04,902 --> 00:14:06,302
What are you waiting for? Hurry!

263
00:14:07,602 --> 00:14:08,802
Okay!

264
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:18,239
The victim is Mr. Masato Sugimori, age 32.

265
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:20,339
A freelance writer, right?

266
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:21,839
Yes, that's right.

267
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,140
I had an appointment to see him today.

268
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,839
He wanted to interview the children.

269
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:31,040
And? When you got here, you found him like this?

270
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,940
Yes.

271
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,839
By the way, when did you get the request for the interview?

272
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,239
At sundown the day before yesterday.

273
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:42,540
He came to the school.

274
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,239
Which means he was still alive until then.

275
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:47,540
Hey, Ms. Kobayashi.

276
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,540
You told Mr. Sugimori that we're going to be interviewed, right?

277
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,739
Yes.

278
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:57,339
I called Mr. Sugimori before noon yesterday and told him.

279
00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:00,140
Do you know at exactly what time it was?

280
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,839
Hold on a second.

281
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,040
I'm sure that I got the call on my cell phone

282
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,339
in between 3rd and 4th period.

283
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:09,339
So I can probably tell if I look through the list of incoming calls.

284
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:12,140
It's 11:22.

285
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,540
Which means he was killed after that time.

286
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,739
-Inspector. -What?

287
00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:21,440
It seems that the murder weapon is the tripod of this camera.

288
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,239
If the killer came into the room and battered him to death,

289
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:28,739
the killer is most likely an acquaintance.

290
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:31,140
Yes. Being that he's a writer,

291
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,140
someone that he interviewed could be the suspect.

292
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,440
Right.

293
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,440
He may have written an article exposing someone's deeds.

294
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,040
But if he wrote about people in show biz,

295
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,640
the fans of the target may have gotten upset,

296
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,540
then we will end up with a whole lot of suspects.

297
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,239
I think there are four suspicious people.

298
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,540
-What? -What?

299
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,040
Conan?

300
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,839
Take a look here at the button of the answer phone.

301
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,940
The light's blinking.

302
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:06,839
There seems to be four messages in it.

303
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,739
But, Conan, what makes you think that these four are suspicious?

304
00:16:10,739 --> 00:16:12,739
Look more closely.

305
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,640
At the edge of the button.

306
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,839
Now, do you get it?

307
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,040
The blood on it has been rubbed off.

308
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,040
What?

309
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,040
You're right.

310
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,040
So that means...

311
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,540
someone pushed the button of the answer phone after the blood splattered.

312
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,140
I wonder who did this?

313
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,940
Well...

314
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,640
It's after the victim was struck so...

315
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,440
If the victim who was barely conscious

316
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,239
pushed it himself after the culprit fled,

317
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:44,440
he would've called the police instead of pushing the answer phone button.

318
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,839
Besides, inspector,

319
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,239
there are no blood stains on the finger of the victim.

320
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:52,239
So that means that the killer pushed the button?

321
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:53,440
Yes.

322
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,239
It's only likely to think

323
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:57,940
that the button was pushed after the victim was struck.

324
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,739
Why would the killer do something like that?

325
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:02,839
Well, most probably because the killer

326
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,140
didn't want anyone to find Mr. Sugimori.

327
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,039
If the phone is set on answer phone even if someone were to call,

328
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,340
no one would come thinking that he's out somewhere.

329
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:16,739
But the key of this room is on table and the door wasn't locked.

330
00:17:16,739 --> 00:17:17,739
Key?

331
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,840
If the killer didn't want Mr. Sugimori to be found,

332
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,640
I think the killer would've locked the door.

333
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,840
That's true.

334
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
Then the only possible thing left would be...

335
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,440
The killer...

336
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:39,640
Entered the message into the answer phone...

337
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,440
In order to establish an alibi.

338
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,539
Then it's understandable why the door wasn't locked.

339
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:48,140
Yeah.

340
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,539
If discovery of his body is too delayed

341
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:52,440
and the estimated time of death becomes uncertain,

342
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,440
the alibi that is established will go down the drain.

343
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,940
What?

344
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,940
Okay. Let's listen to these right now.

345
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,440
What's going on?

346
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:06,440
What's with this boy?

347
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,440
Okay. Let's hear the voices of the four suspects.

348
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,740
Wait! Inspector!

349
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,740
What? What is it?

350
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,240
Shouldn't we record it while listening to it, just in case?

351
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,039
That way, we can listen to it repeatedly.

352
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,539
We don't want to risk making a mistake and losing the tape.

353
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:25,340
True.

354
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,340
I'll go ask the forensic officers

355
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,140
for a recording device and have them bring it over.

356
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,840
-Do that, will you? -Excuse me.

357
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,039
Hey, Conan!

358
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,840
Is the killer's voice really inside the answer phone?

359
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,940
Yeah.

360
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,440
The blood that splattered on the "on" button was partially smeared off.

361
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,940
After killing Mr. Sugimori,

362
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,740
the killer turned on the answer phone

363
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,640
and left a message in it to establish his alibi.

364
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,140
But the killer could've done so just to confuse authorities, right?

365
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,039
Then take a look at that.

366
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,039
There's blood on the door knob of the entrance door.

367
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,240
It's evidence that the killer rushed out of this room

368
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,740
without realizing that it was there.

369
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,940
Oh, you're right.

370
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,440
There's blood on it.

371
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,640
The blood smeared on the answering machine button wasn't intentional.

372
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,039
It doesn't look like the killer

373
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:25,039
suddenly tried to scheme something at the last minute either.

374
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,240
If there are no fingerprints detected on the blood on the knob,

375
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,640
the killer must've used a glove.

376
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,340
Slow down a bit.

377
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,640
Aren't you speeding off too much from the beginning?

378
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,039
Officer Takagi and Inspector Megure are used to you,

379
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,440
so maybe it's okay.

380
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,840
But it's the first time Ms. Kobayashi hears you making a deduction.

381
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,240
She looked flustered.

382
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,740
Slow down a bit.

383
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,640
Slow down?

384
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,240
She's looking this way, too.

385
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,740
Not good.

386
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,340
I hear you do a lot of things.

387
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,940
Like what?

388
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:12,440
Saying things like "Huh" or "Funny".

389
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,440
You know, those deceiving kind of stupid childish remarks you make.

390
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:17,640
Why, you...

391
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,340
I'm sure you know this,

392
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,640
but if the public learns about your detective work,

393
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,140
it'll eventually reach their ears, too.

394
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,140
Yeah, I know.

395
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,940
I was planning on keeping my mouth shut during this interview, too.

396
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,940
I wonder about that.

397
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:41,140
Is it true that this victim, Mr. Sugimori, is a writer in demand?

398
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,340
Yes.

399
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,539
When he came over to the school the day before yesterday,

400
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:47,340
he himself said so.

401
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,940
He told me that his name is becoming rather popular these days.

402
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:55,940
If so, it would seem that he would be living in a better place than this.

403
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,940
Maybe Mr. Sugimori was just lying.

404
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,940
No. He...

405
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,940
I know.

406
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,039
It's kind of embarrassing acting it out after being told to do so.

407
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,740
Look at that!

408
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,539
There's an interesting key on Mr. Sugimori's hip!

409
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,940
Look! A silver horse is attached to it!

410
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,539
That person must've loved animals.

411
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,940
Hey!

412
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,940
I'm sorry.

413
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,840
It's the key to a Ferrari.

414
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,340
You mean that super car?

415
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,940
Is that a super car?

416
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,740
But if that's true,

417
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,140
it could be that Mr. Sugimori was poor because of the car.

418
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,940
There are people who are tight on their living expenses

419
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,240
because they want to spend money on their luxury car.

420
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,240
He had the key to this room separated from his car keys,

421
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,640
so this shows that he was also most probably a show-off.

422
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,840
Hey, Conan.

423
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,039
What was that "huh" thing a while ago about?

424
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:08,539
We're looked down upon by adults because of such attitudes of yours.

425
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:12,140
I think it's cute, but maybe it's a bit too childish.

426
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,740
That's right, Conan!

427
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,640
Please don't go around doing stuff like that all on your own.

428
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,539
Oh, come on.

429
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,440
But...

430
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,940
No matter how I go about doing this...

431
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,340
it's not gonna be easy.

432
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,900
Next Conan's Hint:

433
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,760
"Sound of the railroad crossing"
