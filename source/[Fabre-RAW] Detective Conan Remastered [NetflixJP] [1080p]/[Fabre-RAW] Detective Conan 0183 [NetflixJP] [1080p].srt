1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,840
Just as flowing water has no form

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,540
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,540
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,240
Today's point is a shopping receipt.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,140
A small piece of paper says a lot.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult,

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,640
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,390
Whoopee, whoopee.

10
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,290
How's about it, Mitsuhiko?

11
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,990
Yaiba Kick!

12
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,990
Gosh! I'm beat!

13
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,890
It's my turn next!

14
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,390
How long are you guys going to keep this up?

15
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,090
There, Ayumi! Go for it!

16
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,690
I'm not going to lose! There!

17
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:18,790
No!

18
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,790
Yaiba Punch!

19
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:28,690
"Dangerous Recipe"

20
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,590
"B1-Food Products"

21
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:36,290
An ice cream cone after a battle is delicious.

22
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,190
Right. You should've played too, Conan.

23
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,790
Yeah, maybe next time.

24
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,590
It sure is crowded, isn't it?

25
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,090
It's already past 16:00,

26
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,690
so they're all here to buy things for making dinner.

27
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,490
Dinner... I wonder what it is today.

28
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,090
I hope it's eels over rice.

29
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,990
Right! Why don't we play a menu deduction game?

30
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,290
A menu deduction game?

31
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,890
What's that?

32
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,190
Well, it goes like this.

33
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,090
We deduce what the shoppers are having for dinner

34
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,690
by looking at the receipts they leave behind.

35
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,490
Okay, here goes.

36
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,590
Potatoes, onions,

37
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,490
"Keiran", six pack.

38
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,590
What's a "keiran"?

39
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,090
Eggs. Eggs of a hen.

40
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,090
I see.

41
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,690
Next. Ground beef and bread crumbs.

42
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,890
-The answer is? -I got it! It's croquette!

43
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,790
But you also need flour to make it, don't you?

44
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,390
Maybe she's already got the flour.

45
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,390
I see.

46
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,090
It's my turn next.

47
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,890
Well, chicken thighs, ketchup,

48
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,390
green peas, tomato, lettuce and celery.

49
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,190
Chicken rice!

50
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,190
With vegetable salad.

51
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,890
Okay, next it's my turn!

52
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,490
There's a lot listed.

53
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,990
Okay, here goes.

54
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:03,890
Well, potatoes, onions, beef, flour, sugar.

55
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,690
The answer is?

56
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,090
Meat with potatoes...

57
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,590
Cream stew or gratin?

58
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,890
But then it should be salt and pepper, not sugar.

59
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,690
Maybe the sugar is going to be used for something else.

60
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,990
The person doesn't have to be buying ingredients

61
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,690
only for tonight's dinner, right?

62
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,290
I see. That's true.

63
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,790
Then, here's the next one.

64
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,590
Peti... Petite knife, cutting board,

65
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:39,290
grater, handy gloves, food case, dustpan.

66
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,590
Isn't that the receipt for a different section?

67
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,390
What is this thing called petite knife?

68
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,690
It's a small knife.

69
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,690
Something like a knife for cutting fruit.

70
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,990
What're handy gloves?

71
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,590
Gloves used when cooking?

72
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,390
Do you wear gloves when cooking?

73
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,790
Oh, I get it!

74
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,490
That person probably just moved in,

75
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,590
and is going to start cooking from tonight.

76
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,190
That's why the shopper bought a knife and cutting board too.

77
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,590
The grater's going to be used for grating onions.

78
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,990
Their deductions are pretty good.

79
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,790
The dustpan's going to be used for cleaning.

80
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,590
Obviously.

81
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,090
I wonder if she's a young woman?

82
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,790
It could also be a man.

83
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,490
Well, the third one is...

84
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,090
It's Masked Yaiba color ball!

85
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,790
Huh? Then maybe there's a child?

86
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,490
The fourth one is

87
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,690
size #2 batteries, handle light...

88
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,890
What's a handle light?

89
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,290
I think it's light that you attach to the handle of a bicycle.

90
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,590
The items are not all food, are they?

91
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,690
The fifth one is...

92
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,090
This one is of another store.

93
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,590
Drugstore Satoshi Kobayashi.

94
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,590
The drugstore next door.

95
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,490
The name of the drugstore changed recently, right?

96
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,390
Never mind that. What's on the shopping list?

97
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:02,490
Well... Chlo... chlorine?

98
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,790
Chlorine!

99
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,790
Genta, show me that!

100
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,090
The receipt of the food products section that you read at the beginning too.

101
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,690
What's with you, Conan?

102
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,290
-Hurry, give it to me! -Okay.

103
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,890
What's wrong, Conan?

104
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,690
He's right. Chlorine.

105
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,590
What on earth is that thing called "chlorine"?

106
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,890
It's a colorless or whitish crystalline substance,

107
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,690
usually used to sterilize or disinfect the skin.

108
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,590
There is another way this substance is used.

109
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,290
Another way?

110
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,390
Chlorine is deadly toxic.

111
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,890
What?

112
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,190
Did you say toxic?

113
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,290
Well, it's usually used to make mole balls

114
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,490
to get rid of moles.

115
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,690
The ingredients for making those mole balls are

116
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,490
on this receipt, potatoes, onions, beef, flour, and sugar.

117
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,190
Then maybe the shopper bought them to get rid of moles.

118
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,390
Genta.

119
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,890
Do you think that there are moles in a city like this?

120
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,490
That's true.

121
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,290
Maybe we see mice sometimes.

122
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,590
Then maybe it's going to be used to disinfect the skin after all.

123
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,190
The potatoes and onions

124
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,590
are going to be used to make stew or gratin.

125
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,290
Well, I guess so.

126
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,090
Conan.

127
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,890
If it bothers you so much,

128
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,590
why don't you ask the employees here?

129
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,390
Yeah, you're right.

130
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,790
Well...

131
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:36,290
15:20. It was bought only an hour ago.

132
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,490
The person in charge is Masako Arai.

133
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,890
Thank you for waiting.

134
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,490
I remember that person very well.

135
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,990
All right!

136
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,090
He was about 20 years old.

137
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,690
At first, I thought what he wanted was out of stock,

138
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,590
so I told him it'll come in tomorrow.

139
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,890
But he insisted he needed it today.

140
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,690
How did he act?

141
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,890
He seemed sort of jittery and didn't look all that calm.

142
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,290
Do you remember his face?

143
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,490
The color of his hair?

144
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,590
Was he fat like me?

145
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,490
Please tell us!

146
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,290
Hey.

147
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,990
Height, about 170 centimeters.

148
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,690
Brown hair and wearing glasses.

149
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,990
Skinny and wearing a blackish top.

150
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:43,190
The point is why this man bought chlorine.

151
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,690
Yeah. If he used it to disinfect his skin,

152
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,890
it bothers me that he didn't seem calm.

153
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,290
Hey. What happens if humans eat the mole balls?

154
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,490
Well...

155
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,090
It won't kill the person,

156
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:01,090
but probably numb the body making it unable to move.

157
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,590
Unable to move?

158
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,590
I got it!

159
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,990
The guy was trying to make mole balls after all!

160
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,790
He was going to make somebody eat them

161
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,990
and then kidnap the person.

162
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,790
Kidnap?

163
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,090
If so, it's understandable why he bought the ingredients

164
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,390
to make mole balls despite no moles.

165
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,590
Anyway, let's search the identity of this man.

166
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,790
Yes...

167
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,790
I wonder.

168
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,290
I don't remember because there are a lot of shoppers.

169
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,790
This is the one.

170
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,490
Petite knife, 1980 yen.

171
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,990
Although it's small, it's enough to cut potatoes and onions.

172
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,590
The cutting board is plastic

173
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,490
and is also the smallest one around.

174
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,390
The grater is also plastic.

175
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,290
Everything looks like something a man who doesn't usually cook

176
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,590
rushed to buy.

177
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:59,190
Hey! These are the glove for 120 yen!

178
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,390
Very thin gloves made of polyethylene.

179
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,290
If these are used to make mole balls,

180
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,990
no fingerprints would be left behind.

181
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,790
Disposables.

182
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,990
But it's more than enough to carry around the mole balls.

183
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,390
This dustpan has the longest and thinnest handle.

184
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,590
But, what does a dustpan have to do

185
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,090
with the sales floor mole balls?

186
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,390
I can't tell either.

187
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:38,490
Maybe a guy something like that bought it.

188
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,690
Do you have any idea who he is?

189
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,590
No.

190
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:47,790
Hey! Did you know that this pole glows in the dark?

191
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,390
It's made with fluorescent paint.

192
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,790
What does this have to do with the mole balls?

193
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,090
We didn't notice anybody like that buying it, did we?

194
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,190
And we were playing right behind too.

195
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,290
This handle light.

196
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,590
I remember it well

197
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,390
because it's a new item that just came out only three days ago.

198
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,490
See.

199
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:15,190
This is an important piece of evidence!

200
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,990
Was the person who bought it

201
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,490
about 170 centimeters

202
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,590
and ah skinny, wearing a blackish top,

203
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,590
with brown hair and glasses?

204
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,790
Oh, you really are knowledgeable.

205
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,890
He also bought batteries.

206
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:33,190
But I have no idea of who or where he lives.

207
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,490
Okay, we'll buy that

208
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,290
Are you going to put that on your bicycle too, Conan?

209
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,390
If so, you've got to buy batteries too.

210
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,090
I'm not going to use it.

211
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:52,090
We'll use it as a clue to finding the man.

212
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:56,690
But how? Without even knowing his name or address.

213
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,790
No, we've got a clue.

214
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,890
The sixth receipt.

215
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:04,390
We haven't looked at the sixth receipt yet.

216
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,190
It's a receipt from a convenience store.

217
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,290
Utopia, Beikacho Park Branch.

218
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,590
A vinyl umbrella was bought at 14:50.

219
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,890
14:50?

220
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,390
That's about the time we were at the Beika Library.

221
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:21,490
Yeah, and there was a sudden pour of shower.

222
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,990
200 meters from this shop,

223
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,290
there is a bus stop for the Beika Station bus.

224
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,290
The man probably rode the Beika Station.

225
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,590
I think this guy walked from his residence

226
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,790
and headed for Beika station.

227
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:38,990
But since it suddenly began to pour,

228
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,990
he went into this store and bought himself an umbrella.

229
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:46,090
So he lives close to the store

230
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,190
at the opposite side of the bus stop.

231
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,490
Enough of a distance that going back for an umbrella would be a pain.

232
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:56,090
Judging from the fact that he bought a knife and cutting board,

233
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,790
he probably doesn't live with his family,

234
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,590
but rather alone in an apartment or a condo.

235
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,090
I see, living alone.

236
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:06,990
It's most likely that he frequents the convenience store.

237
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,890
Maybe we'll be able to find out who he is or where he lives.

238
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,390
Okay, let's go to that store!

239
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:16,490
The man remarked that he had to have the chlorine by today.

240
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,490
If the plans to make the mole balls by today

241
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,490
and make someone eat it...

242
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,790
We've got to hurry. We have no time to lose!

243
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,570
This way!

244
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,370
Brown hair, wearing glasses, about 20 years old,

245
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:11,870
about 170 meters tall, and a male...

246
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,670
We have a lot of customers like that.

247
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:19,170
He bought a large vinyl umbrella at about 14:50.

248
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,670
Maybe it could be him.

249
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,970
Do you know him?

250
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:26,670
Yes. He comes here every so often.

251
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,770
Do you know his name or address?

252
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,370
No.

253
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,770
But I think he lives nearby

254
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,570
because he comes here wearing sandals most of the time.

255
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,870
We couldn't find out who or where he lives after all.

256
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,870
We've got no choice but to split up and look for him.

257
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:45,370
What? -But, how?

258
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,470
The bicycle!

259
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,170
Bicycle?

260
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,370
The man didn't go shopping with his bicycle

261
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:53,370
because it wasn't equipped with a basket to carry his things in.

262
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,470
And I'm positive that the guy's bicycle

263
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,970
has a new type handle light on it.

264
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,670
I see! So, we're going to look for a bicycle that doesn't have a basket

265
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,870
and has a new type handle light attached to it

266
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,070
parked in the apartments nearby.

267
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,270
Yes.

268
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,070
Take this, Genta,

269
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,870
so you don't make a mistake.

270
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,070
All right!

271
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,370
For you, Ayumi and Mitsuhiko.

272
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,870
Okay. -Okay.

273
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,970
Listen. Like I said before,

274
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,570
the man's house is near here opposite the bus stop.

275
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:24,970
He lives some distance away

276
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,670
that it is too much trouble to go back home to get his umbrella.

277
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,170
If you find him, report so, using your badges.

278
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,070
See you.

279
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,370
-Conan! -That way is the bus stop!

280
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,570
Where on earth is he going?

281
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,070
I'm sure Conan has something in mind.

282
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,970
Let's go ahead and look for the guy.

283
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,070
Okay.

284
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,070
He probably went to buy the handle light today

285
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,270
because he's planning to use his bicycle tonight.

286
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,970
We've got to be ready for that too.

287
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,970
But I wonder what he's going to use the dustpan and pole for?

288
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,870
"Mouri Detective Agency"

289
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,170
I found it!

290
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,970
Testing microphone, testing microphone.

291
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,670
Youth Detective Squad...

292
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,570
The bicycle in question has been found!

293
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,870
Report the scene on the double!

294
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,370
Good work, Genta!

295
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,070
Genta!

296
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,470
So, you've found it!

297
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,470
Only Conan's not here yet.

298
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,470
You went back to get your skateboard?

299
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,770
Yes.

300
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,070
So, he lives here.

301
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,470
Yes.

302
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,770
But I wonder which room he lives in.

303
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,770
Let's hide and watch.

304
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,170
He should be coming out.

305
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,170
Yes...

306
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,270
Somebody is coming out!

307
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:35,270
About 170 meters tall, skinny, wearing a blackish top,

308
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,870
brown hair and glasses!

309
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,570
-Is it him? -Wait.

310
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,070
It's definitely him.

311
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,870
Okay!

312
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,370
-Me too! -Same here!

313
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,470
Me too!

314
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,870
Gosh!

315
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,170
Hang on tight.

316
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,770
Conan, he's pulling away from us.

317
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,470
At this rate, we'll lose him.

318
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,770
Can't you speed up a bit more?

319
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,870
You guys are too heavy!

320
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,270
He's gone.

321
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,670
We've lost him after all.

322
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:33,070
He got off here, which means...

323
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,870
It's most likely that he went into one of the houses nearby.

324
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,770
Should we check one house after another?

325
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,070
Huh?

326
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,470
I don't want to go in this alley.

327
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,970
There's a house with a large yard,

328
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,470
with a big dog that barks a lot here.

329
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,470
A dog?

330
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,270
Maybe...

331
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:54,070
Did you know that this pole glows in the dark?

332
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:57,370
This dustpan has the longest and thinnest handle.

333
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,170
Don't.

334
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:49,570
What you are about to do is a crime, you know.

335
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,970
No use trying to flee!

336
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,070
Your name is Murakami, isn't it?

337
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,070
We know where you live too!

338
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,370
What?

339
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,270
Well, Mr. Murakami,

340
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,670
are you still going to run?

341
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,770
Genta, take off your shoes!

342
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,770
What?

343
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,170
The shoe!

344
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,070
My shoe...

345
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,670
After this, the neighbors call the police, who arrive in no time.

346
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,670
Murakami is arrested.

347
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:57,370
To think that he was going to give the mole balls to the dog.

348
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:01,170
I heard from the officer of Beikacho police station over the phone

349
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:04,970
that the guy was saying he was going to kill that dog one of these days,

350
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:07,270
everyday when he went out for a walk along his favorite path,

351
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:10,570
that dog would bark ferociously at him.

352
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,970
That dog really does bark a lot.

353
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:17,370
He learned of making mole balls in a book,

354
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,670
and yesterday afternoon, when he passed in front of the house,

355
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,970
he happened to find out that the entire family

356
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,470
was out on an overnight trip.

357
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,070
He suddenly decided to carry out his plan.

358
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,270
He was going to feed the dog the mole balls,

359
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,570
and after it became immobile,

360
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:31,670
he was going to hit it with the stick and kill it.

361
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:34,070
The menu game that we decided to play

362
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,670
ended up saving that dog's life, didn't it?

363
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,370
Right.

364
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,570
Let's play it again!

365
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,670
I brought the receipts!

366
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,470
Don't pick things like that up.

367
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,070
Okay, here goes.

368
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:48,370
Sashimi, Mayonnaise, cup noodles...

369
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,370
I feel sick.

370
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,440
Next Conan's Hint:

371
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,360
"Necklace"

372
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,040
Next time is 15 minutes special.

373
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,500
That's too short! One hour special original story!
