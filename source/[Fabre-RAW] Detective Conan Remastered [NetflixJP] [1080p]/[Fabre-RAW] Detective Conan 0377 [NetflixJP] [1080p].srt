1
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,372
Today's story has to do with Peach Boy.

2
00:00:24,372 --> 00:00:25,972
Clear up the mystery of the legend!

3
00:00:25,972 --> 00:00:28,072
A dog, pheasant, monkey, and even an ogre appear!

4
00:00:28,072 --> 00:00:29,472
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,472 --> 00:00:31,272
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,272 --> 00:00:33,472
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:58,522 --> 00:02:02,522
-"Peach Boy!" -"Peach Boy!"

8
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:06,522
"Those sweets you have hanging on your hip..."

9
00:02:06,522 --> 00:02:10,522
"I'd like to have one, too..."

10
00:02:10,522 --> 00:02:12,222
Huh? Peach Boy?

11
00:02:15,322 --> 00:02:18,122
According to the legend of "Peach Boy",

12
00:02:18,122 --> 00:02:21,022
around the middle of the 7th Century, in order to defeat Ura,

13
00:02:21,022 --> 00:02:23,922
the demon that had come from a foreign land

14
00:02:23,922 --> 00:02:26,622
to carry out a countless number of atrocities,

15
00:02:26,622 --> 00:02:28,322
the Yamato Court sends out a gallant and renown warrior called

16
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:30,222
Kibitsuhiko-no-Mikoto.

17
00:02:30,222 --> 00:02:33,422
It is said that this story is based on the battle between these two.

18
00:02:33,422 --> 00:02:34,722
But that is not the fact.

19
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,722
The fact is in the year 663,

20
00:02:38,722 --> 00:02:40,622
as stated also in the Chronicles of Japan,

21
00:02:40,622 --> 00:02:44,922
the Japanese Yamato military that lost in the Battle of Hakusukinoe,

22
00:02:44,922 --> 00:02:46,622
built fortifications one after the other

23
00:02:46,622 --> 00:02:48,522
to prepare against the attacks of enemy forces.

24
00:02:48,522 --> 00:02:49,622
This story seems to be related to one of the fortifications,

25
00:02:49,622 --> 00:02:53,122
Kinnojyo and Kibitsu in Okayama Prefecture where the castle is located.

26
00:02:53,122 --> 00:02:55,722
It seems that here, in Kibitsu, was where the legend began.

27
00:02:57,422 --> 00:02:59,722
There are many ancient tombs in Kibitsuji.

28
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:02,722
Of course they reflect the culture of those times.

29
00:03:02,722 --> 00:03:06,122
As well as the memories of various people.

30
00:03:12,222 --> 00:03:17,822
"Peach Boy Mystery Solving Tour (Part 1)"

31
00:03:21,522 --> 00:03:22,822
When one thinks of Okayama,

32
00:03:22,822 --> 00:03:25,122
what comes to mind is "Peach Boy", right?

33
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,422
And "Peach Boy" also brings to mind...

34
00:03:26,422 --> 00:03:27,622
Millet dumpling!

35
00:03:27,622 --> 00:03:29,822
Everything is food to you, isn't it, Genta?

36
00:03:31,222 --> 00:03:32,522
A dog, right?

37
00:03:32,522 --> 00:03:34,222
-A pheasant! -Monkey!

38
00:03:34,222 --> 00:03:36,622
-And the demons of Demon's Island! -And the demons of Demon's Island!

39
00:03:36,622 --> 00:03:38,622
Well true, but...

40
00:03:38,622 --> 00:03:42,322
After all, this is a weekend trip as well as a history study tour.

41
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,422
Yes, we studied beforehand for this.

42
00:03:45,422 --> 00:03:46,922
So please be more professional.

43
00:03:46,922 --> 00:03:48,922
Or that's what I'd like to say,

44
00:03:48,922 --> 00:03:51,722
but first of all, I want to eat some Mamakari!

45
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:55,522
Gosh! Not you, too!

46
00:03:55,522 --> 00:03:56,922
Sorry. I'm sorry!

47
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:04,522
We've arrived in Okayama!

48
00:04:04,522 --> 00:04:07,022
We're transferring to the Sanyo main line next!

49
00:04:07,022 --> 00:04:08,622
Hurry, hurry!

50
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:11,922
Hey, you don't have to rush so much.

51
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,522
The train's already here!

52
00:04:34,422 --> 00:04:39,222
Kurashiki is famous for its fine sight landscape of white walls.

53
00:04:39,222 --> 00:04:42,022
Yes, it's what travel-loving girls admire.

54
00:04:45,322 --> 00:04:49,222
But before that, this is where I want to go.

55
00:04:51,622 --> 00:04:53,222
-Hello! -Hello!

56
00:05:09,822 --> 00:05:12,122
Chibori Park...

57
00:05:13,122 --> 00:05:15,122
That's enough, Seiko!

58
00:05:16,622 --> 00:05:19,122
What makes you think you can talk to me like that, Saruwatari?

59
00:05:19,122 --> 00:05:22,722
You got to go independent because I wrote an article for you.

60
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,022
Just how much do you think I had to pay you for...

61
00:05:25,022 --> 00:05:29,222
I went out of my way to give you "classmate discount".

62
00:05:29,222 --> 00:05:30,622
You got to be kidding!

63
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:33,122
Are you all right, Ayumi?

64
00:05:33,122 --> 00:05:35,022
Look what you did to Ayumi!

65
00:05:35,022 --> 00:05:36,322
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

66
00:05:36,322 --> 00:05:38,622
Are you all right? I'm so sorry.

67
00:05:38,622 --> 00:05:40,822
I hope you're not hurt, are you?

68
00:05:41,822 --> 00:05:43,922
Thank you so much.

69
00:05:43,922 --> 00:05:47,922
No. We're sorry and embarrassed for acting so childish.

70
00:05:47,922 --> 00:05:50,522
I feel bad.

71
00:05:50,522 --> 00:05:52,622
You're right.

72
00:05:52,622 --> 00:05:54,622
I'll bet you're feeling really lucky.

73
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:57,022
Hey, did you both apologize?

74
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:58,022
Yes.

75
00:05:58,022 --> 00:06:01,922
Little lady, does the ice cream we bought for you taste good?

76
00:06:01,922 --> 00:06:03,922
Yes, it's delicious!

77
00:06:03,922 --> 00:06:05,322
I'm glad!

78
00:06:05,322 --> 00:06:07,822
That's no way to apologize, is it?

79
00:06:07,822 --> 00:06:10,122
You're all friends, aren't you?

80
00:06:10,122 --> 00:06:11,922
I don't think it's good to fight.

81
00:06:11,922 --> 00:06:13,922
Friends, huh?

82
00:06:13,922 --> 00:06:17,322
It's true that we're classmates since our elementary school days.

83
00:06:17,322 --> 00:06:20,022
But some live in Osaka and others in Tokyo now.

84
00:06:20,022 --> 00:06:22,922
So, it's been about 15 years since we've seen each other.

85
00:06:22,922 --> 00:06:26,822
The last time we saw each other was when we were just about your age.

86
00:06:26,822 --> 00:06:29,822
Which means, it's your class reunion?

87
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:30,922
Sort of.

88
00:06:30,922 --> 00:06:33,822
I'm sorry, my name is Agasa.

89
00:06:33,822 --> 00:06:37,022
I'm their chaperone, or rather, I'm escorting the children on their trip.

90
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:40,022
I'm Ayumi. Ayumi Yoshida!

91
00:06:40,022 --> 00:06:42,222
I'm Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya!

92
00:06:42,222 --> 00:06:43,722
I'm Genta Kojima!

93
00:06:45,022 --> 00:06:47,022
I'm Conan Edogawa.

94
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:49,822
We're members of the Youth Detective Squad...

95
00:06:52,222 --> 00:06:53,722
"Naoto Momoi (27)" -What a polite introduction.

96
00:06:53,722 --> 00:06:55,522
I'm Naoto Momoi.

97
00:06:55,522 --> 00:06:57,922
"Yayoi Kijima (27)" -I'm Yayoi Kijima. Nice to meet you.

98
00:06:57,922 --> 00:07:00,522
"Kengo Saruwatari (27)" -From this side, he's Kengo Saruwatari,

99
00:07:00,522 --> 00:07:01,922
-Seiko Inui. -Hi!

100
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,522
"Mamoru Onitsura (27)" -And Mamoru Onitsura.

101
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:05,522
Youth Detective Squad?

102
00:07:05,522 --> 00:07:09,122
We named our group something like that, too.

103
00:07:09,122 --> 00:07:11,122
And we're gathered because...

104
00:07:11,122 --> 00:07:12,422
I'll tell you!

105
00:07:12,422 --> 00:07:14,822
After all, it's what I proposed to begin with.

106
00:07:14,822 --> 00:07:18,122
We got together this time to support Momoi's candidacy

107
00:07:18,122 --> 00:07:21,422
and also to congratulate his marriage to Yayoi!

108
00:07:21,422 --> 00:07:23,722
Amazing! You're going to be running in the election.

109
00:07:23,722 --> 00:07:25,222
And getting married, too?

110
00:07:25,222 --> 00:07:27,022
Congratulations!

111
00:07:27,022 --> 00:07:28,722
Thank you.

112
00:07:28,722 --> 00:07:32,522
Peach Boy and the pheasant are going to get married.

113
00:07:32,522 --> 00:07:34,522
-So you noticed too, Mitsuhiko? -Yes.

114
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:38,122
You guys are like "Peach Boy".

115
00:07:38,122 --> 00:07:39,922
What's this about?

116
00:07:39,922 --> 00:07:41,122
Their names, right?

117
00:07:43,222 --> 00:07:44,622
The first two letters of their names

118
00:07:44,622 --> 00:07:47,322
are characters that appear in "Peach Boy".

119
00:07:47,322 --> 00:07:50,722
Peach, pheasant, monkey, dog, and demon...

120
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:54,222
Just as expected of the Youth Detective Squad.

121
00:07:54,222 --> 00:08:01,322
That's why we acted out "Peach Boy" in our school play because of it.

122
00:08:01,322 --> 00:08:03,022
Talk about old story.

123
00:08:04,422 --> 00:08:06,322
How nostalgic.

124
00:08:06,322 --> 00:08:10,322
But back then, the stage and interpretation were good.

125
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:11,322
Especially Shunya.

126
00:08:14,822 --> 00:08:16,222
Shunya?

127
00:08:16,222 --> 00:08:18,322
Never mind about the past.

128
00:08:18,322 --> 00:08:20,722
By the way, what now?

129
00:08:20,722 --> 00:08:22,822
I'm thinking of all kinds of things.

130
00:08:22,822 --> 00:08:25,022
Tomorrow we go treasure hunting, right?

131
00:08:25,022 --> 00:08:26,422
Huh? Right.

132
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,022
Treasure hunting?

133
00:08:28,022 --> 00:08:29,622
That's new to me.

134
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:32,022
I'll explain it at dinner time.

135
00:08:32,022 --> 00:08:35,222
Until then, it's free time.

136
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:37,122
I guess that's it for now then.

137
00:08:37,122 --> 00:08:38,522
Bye, little lady!

138
00:08:39,622 --> 00:08:41,922
I guess we should get going, too.

139
00:08:45,722 --> 00:08:48,122
This is Kurashiki.

140
00:08:48,122 --> 00:08:49,722
How nice!

141
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:55,522
The view has been kept as it was in the Edo period.

142
00:08:55,522 --> 00:08:56,822
Right, Doc?

143
00:08:56,822 --> 00:09:01,622
Yes. Most of those warehouses were built by the merchants back then.

144
00:09:01,622 --> 00:09:04,022
They used to transport all kinds of merchandise

145
00:09:04,022 --> 00:09:07,522
sailing their ships into Kurashiki River.

146
00:09:07,522 --> 00:09:11,022
The pasted roof tiles on the east side of this Kurashiki Archaeology Museum

147
00:09:11,022 --> 00:09:15,022
are said to be one of the most beautiful in this fine sights district.

148
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:17,222
All the things exhibited here are things excavated from the tombs and ruins

149
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:24,322
of the districts of Kurashiki, Kibitsu and the entire Seto Inland area.

150
00:09:24,322 --> 00:09:25,822
There sure is a lot to learn.

151
00:09:25,822 --> 00:09:28,322
Coming in touch with culture of the past...

152
00:09:28,322 --> 00:09:30,122
Can be useful.

153
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,422
But this is the best after all!

154
00:09:34,422 --> 00:09:35,722
It's delicious.

155
00:09:39,422 --> 00:09:41,322
It's Mamakari after all.

156
00:09:41,322 --> 00:09:45,122
"Mama carry the food over to me."

157
00:09:45,122 --> 00:09:46,422
There he goes again.

158
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:49,622
A peach?

159
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,922
-A peach? -It's a peach, like in "Peach Boy"!

160
00:09:52,922 --> 00:09:53,922
Amazing!

161
00:09:53,922 --> 00:09:55,422
You got to be kidding.

162
00:09:57,322 --> 00:09:58,822
We've almost got it!

163
00:09:58,822 --> 00:10:00,922
-Genta! -Hang in there!

164
00:10:00,922 --> 00:10:02,722
Hey! Hold on tight!

165
00:10:02,722 --> 00:10:04,622
Be careful.

166
00:10:04,622 --> 00:10:07,322
I didn't think it would be real, but...

167
00:10:07,322 --> 00:10:09,722
And inside we find...

168
00:10:09,722 --> 00:10:11,222
Envelopes?

169
00:10:11,222 --> 00:10:12,922
Inside the envelope is...

170
00:10:13,922 --> 00:10:15,322
What's this?

171
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:16,322
Maybe it's a code!

172
00:10:16,322 --> 00:10:18,022
A code?

173
00:10:19,022 --> 00:10:22,222
If it is, it isn't something all that difficult.

174
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,922
It's elementary school level.

175
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:27,122
But it's something worth studying because we're here!

176
00:10:27,122 --> 00:10:29,422
We'll solve the code and excavate a tomb.

177
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:33,022
Maybe we'll be able to find the treasure on Demon's Island!

178
00:10:33,022 --> 00:10:36,222
-Really? -We'll resolve the "Peach Boy" legend!

179
00:10:36,222 --> 00:10:38,222
Let's do it! Let's do it!

180
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:39,322
Hey, hey.

181
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:41,622
Then I'll go rest somewhere nearby.

182
00:10:41,622 --> 00:10:43,322
All of you give it your best.

183
00:10:43,322 --> 00:10:45,522
I'll leave the rest up to you, Shinichi.

184
00:10:45,522 --> 00:10:47,522
Is this your doing, Doc?

185
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:50,522
No. I know nothing of it. It's not me.

186
00:10:50,522 --> 00:10:53,322
But studying should be fun.

187
00:10:53,322 --> 00:10:56,822
What great educational material to study with. How lucky.

188
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,622
See you.

189
00:10:58,622 --> 00:11:00,422
Give me a break.

190
00:11:00,422 --> 00:11:04,222
Okay, the Youth Detective Squad launches Operation Treasure Hunt!

191
00:11:07,422 --> 00:11:08,422
Hey!

192
00:11:13,335 --> 00:11:15,835
What's with this picture?

193
00:11:15,835 --> 00:11:18,335
On its eyes. This eyelash?

194
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:20,835
Fire, maybe?

195
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:22,335
Conan.

196
00:11:22,335 --> 00:11:26,135
Huh? Oh, that's a very natural way to look at it.

197
00:11:26,135 --> 00:11:28,635
Fire and eye stands for...

198
00:11:28,635 --> 00:11:31,535
Fire and eye...

199
00:11:32,535 --> 00:11:34,035
Fire and eye!

200
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:36,535
It's the Hinomi Yagura (watch tower)!

201
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:42,235
Did you find anything?

202
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:46,235
Did you find something?

203
00:11:46,235 --> 00:11:48,135
This is...

204
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:50,435
Did you find it, Conan?

205
00:11:50,435 --> 00:11:51,935
Yes.

206
00:11:55,035 --> 00:11:56,535
The treasure.

207
00:11:56,535 --> 00:11:57,635
Open it! Open it!

208
00:12:02,935 --> 00:12:05,935
What's this? It's just filled with junk!

209
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:08,235
It's out of battery, too.

210
00:12:08,235 --> 00:12:11,735
At the least, it's no treasure.

211
00:12:11,735 --> 00:12:13,735
What are you looking at, Conan?

212
00:12:13,735 --> 00:12:16,035
6 years was a lot of fun.

213
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:18,835
All except for that one incident.

214
00:12:18,835 --> 00:12:20,835
What does "that" refer to?

215
00:12:20,835 --> 00:12:22,035
Beats me.

216
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:26,335
Maybe this is a time capsule.

217
00:12:26,335 --> 00:12:29,235
-Time capsule? Really? -Time capsule? Are you sure?

218
00:12:29,235 --> 00:12:31,635
If this is somebody's time capsule,

219
00:12:31,635 --> 00:12:34,635
I wonder if it's okay that we dug it up?

220
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:37,735
Of course it's not okay.

221
00:12:37,735 --> 00:12:42,235
But it's obvious that somebody has already dug this up before us.

222
00:12:43,235 --> 00:12:44,635
Maybe this is...

223
00:12:44,635 --> 00:12:47,035
Our rival treasure hunters?

224
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:48,835
If so, we can't let them beat us!

225
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:51,535
Let's hurry and solve the next code, Conan!

226
00:12:53,735 --> 00:12:59,935
A picture of a house and the alphabets "P, I, B, T, I, J,".

227
00:12:59,935 --> 00:13:03,535
Just what does it mean? I can't make it out at all.

228
00:13:03,535 --> 00:13:06,235
Well, this is super basic of codes.

229
00:13:06,235 --> 00:13:07,835
So what is it?

230
00:13:07,835 --> 00:13:11,235
You move each alphabet to the front one by one.

231
00:13:11,235 --> 00:13:13,935
Which means, it's before "P".

232
00:13:13,935 --> 00:13:15,635
-So, "O"? -Right!

233
00:13:15,635 --> 00:13:18,735
The next alphabet before "I" is "H", right?

234
00:13:18,735 --> 00:13:20,335
Next...

235
00:13:20,335 --> 00:13:22,935
Ohashi?

236
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,735
The chopsticks you use when eating?

237
00:13:24,735 --> 00:13:26,535
No, it's probably the name of a place.

238
00:13:26,535 --> 00:13:28,535
Somewhere near Kurashiki here...

239
00:13:28,535 --> 00:13:31,935
You children. What are you doing?

240
00:13:31,935 --> 00:13:33,735
I guess we meet again.

241
00:13:33,735 --> 00:13:35,835
Well, we were trying to solve a code.

242
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:42,235
What brings you here?

243
00:13:42,235 --> 00:13:44,535
Aren't you going around with the rest of your group?

244
00:13:44,535 --> 00:13:46,035
Yes, well...

245
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:48,435
I'm not very well liked by everybody.

246
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:50,135
You saw for yourselves just a while ago, didn't you?

247
00:13:50,135 --> 00:13:53,335
But why not? You're all classmates, aren't you?

248
00:13:53,335 --> 00:13:56,235
Since long way back in the past, I could never lie.

249
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,935
The article I was planning for Mr. Onitsura's company

250
00:13:58,935 --> 00:14:01,335
was all about his underhanded moneylending.

251
00:14:03,435 --> 00:14:06,635
Even when Mr. Saruwatari went independent and opened his own beauty salon,

252
00:14:06,635 --> 00:14:09,635
I honestly wrote how good I thought he was.

253
00:14:09,635 --> 00:14:13,235
I mean, I can't help it because he's not good.

254
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:15,135
Then, Yayoi...

255
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:17,335
I ended up fighting for Mr. Momoi with her.

256
00:14:17,335 --> 00:14:20,535
We were going with each other until recently.

257
00:14:20,535 --> 00:14:22,235
Him and I.

258
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:26,635
I see, that's why something about them was awkward.

259
00:14:26,635 --> 00:14:29,335
Isn't Shunya coming?

260
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,135
You're sure sharp, renown detective!

261
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:33,735
I remember you saying that he was in charge of making the script

262
00:14:33,735 --> 00:14:37,535
and interpretation of the "Peach Boy" play that you put on.

263
00:14:37,535 --> 00:14:40,435
Of course, we would've called him,

264
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:43,535
if he were alive.

265
00:14:43,535 --> 00:14:45,435
You mean he passed away?

266
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:50,035
15 years ago in a traffic accident, so we couldn't graduate together.

267
00:14:50,035 --> 00:14:51,935
Poor thing.

268
00:14:51,935 --> 00:14:55,435
He was full of justice and a really good boy.

269
00:14:56,535 --> 00:14:58,335
Sorry, sorry, it's this dark already.

270
00:14:58,335 --> 00:15:00,435
I'll see you all again.

271
00:15:00,435 --> 00:15:03,135
Hang in there, Youth Detective Squad!

272
00:15:06,135 --> 00:15:08,435
Here it is! We've found it!

273
00:15:09,435 --> 00:15:11,635
Ohashi.

274
00:15:11,635 --> 00:15:12,835
An old house!

275
00:15:12,835 --> 00:15:16,035
It sort of sounds like something in a samurai movie.

276
00:15:16,035 --> 00:15:18,035
If I remember correctly, after the development of Shioda,

277
00:15:18,035 --> 00:15:22,035
this Ohashi residence became a great landowner.

278
00:15:22,035 --> 00:15:26,835
This house is said to be about 200 years old.

279
00:15:26,835 --> 00:15:29,035
Amazing, Mitsuhiko!

280
00:15:29,035 --> 00:15:31,835
Well, it's really no big deal.

281
00:15:31,835 --> 00:15:34,135
I'm glad I did some studying beforehand.

282
00:15:34,135 --> 00:15:35,735
Okay, let's search!

283
00:15:37,835 --> 00:15:39,635
I found it! I found it!

284
00:15:39,635 --> 00:15:40,835
Not again.

285
00:15:40,835 --> 00:15:43,235
-It's already been dug up. -Treasure...

286
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:44,935
Not this again.

287
00:15:44,935 --> 00:15:46,435
Old comics.

288
00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:48,635
And old stationery.

289
00:15:48,635 --> 00:15:50,635
Not "that" again.

290
00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:53,735
I'm sure that somebody is beating us to it!

291
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:56,235
Okay, next!

292
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:59,035
The square face of a clown?

293
00:15:59,035 --> 00:16:01,435
What was it called? That symbol used with cell phones?

294
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:02,635
You mean, pictographics!

295
00:16:02,635 --> 00:16:03,835
Right!

296
00:16:03,835 --> 00:16:05,435
This is lower case "t",

297
00:16:05,435 --> 00:16:09,235
this is lower case "u", this is "t" too, and...

298
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:13,035
This is "a", but I wonder why it's reversed?

299
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:15,535
T-u-t-a (Ivy).

300
00:16:15,535 --> 00:16:17,635
You mean, ivy, the plant?

301
00:16:17,635 --> 00:16:20,135
Tsuta is ivy in English.

302
00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:22,135
The next word is "square".

303
00:16:22,135 --> 00:16:23,535
I got it!

304
00:16:23,535 --> 00:16:25,735
Over there, over there!

305
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:29,735
Kurashiki Ivy Square! Over here.

306
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:31,635
-Ivy! -Right?

307
00:16:31,635 --> 00:16:33,335
How spacious!

308
00:16:33,335 --> 00:16:36,335
This used to be a spinning factory.

309
00:16:36,335 --> 00:16:38,535
It seems that the buildings back then are being used as is,

310
00:16:38,535 --> 00:16:40,935
and turned into hotels and memorial halls.

311
00:16:40,935 --> 00:16:43,235
Okay, let's start!

312
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:44,235
Okay...

313
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:03,935
There's nothing that looks like treasure anywhere.

314
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:05,335
What the heck is going on?

315
00:17:07,135 --> 00:17:08,535
I get it.

316
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:11,335
Not only the "a" is reversed,

317
00:17:11,335 --> 00:17:12,935
everything is in the back.

318
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:15,535
Which means, it is in back of this Ivy Square.

319
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:18,135
I see! Behind!

320
00:17:20,235 --> 00:17:22,335
I found it! I found it!

321
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:24,035
Did you find the treasure?

322
00:17:26,035 --> 00:17:27,935
This again.

323
00:17:27,935 --> 00:17:29,735
This stuffs again?

324
00:17:29,735 --> 00:17:32,935
Talk about depressing.

325
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:34,135
This is no fun.

326
00:17:39,635 --> 00:17:40,835
It's that lady.

327
00:17:40,835 --> 00:17:43,635
No good. She's not breathing anymore.

328
00:17:45,035 --> 00:17:47,635
A dying message.

329
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:50,435
O, N, I. Oni (ogre)?

330
00:17:50,435 --> 00:17:51,835
Oni?

331
00:17:51,835 --> 00:17:55,835
-The killer is an ogre. Like in "Peach Boy"! -Oh, no!

332
00:17:58,835 --> 00:18:02,135
So you're the ones who found her.

333
00:18:02,135 --> 00:18:05,235
The Youth Detective Squad...

334
00:18:05,235 --> 00:18:06,335
There they go again.

335
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,635
If the killer is an ogre...

336
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:09,635
We'll be Peach Boy...

337
00:18:09,635 --> 00:18:12,135
And punish, rather arrest him!

338
00:18:12,135 --> 00:18:13,535
Good grief.

339
00:18:16,335 --> 00:18:19,135
Excuse me, sir. Is that the belongings of the victim?

340
00:18:19,135 --> 00:18:20,835
What? Oh, right.

341
00:18:20,835 --> 00:18:23,835
Huh? Over there, something's not right, is it?

342
00:18:23,835 --> 00:18:25,335
That stamp.

343
00:18:25,335 --> 00:18:28,535
Why is it reversed?

344
00:18:28,535 --> 00:18:30,135
Beats me.

345
00:18:30,135 --> 00:18:31,835
So what?

346
00:18:31,835 --> 00:18:33,735
Well, it's nothing.

347
00:18:33,735 --> 00:18:35,735
Sorry to have bothered you.

348
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:40,735
So being friends of the victim, the four were interrogated by the police.

349
00:18:42,635 --> 00:18:47,135
Which means that none of you has an alibi.

350
00:18:47,135 --> 00:18:49,835
To put it more accurately, I was alone.

351
00:18:49,835 --> 00:18:52,635
Like I said, there were a lot of people at Chibori Park,

352
00:18:52,635 --> 00:18:54,835
so there must be somebody who remembers seeing me.

353
00:18:54,835 --> 00:18:56,335
Same here.

354
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,635
I was in the lobby of the hotel that I'm staying at.

355
00:18:58,635 --> 00:18:59,935
There were a lot of people there, too.

356
00:18:59,935 --> 00:19:04,435
Unfortunately, it would be difficult to verify your situation.

357
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,935
I guess we don't have a problem, then?

358
00:19:06,935 --> 00:19:08,835
We were together all the while.

359
00:19:08,835 --> 00:19:11,435
You were walking along the fine sights district, you say?

360
00:19:11,435 --> 00:19:13,635
Yes, sir. We were together all the say.

361
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:16,135
The only time we were alone was when we went to the bathroom.

362
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:18,335
Even so, we weren't separated for more than five minutes.

363
00:19:18,335 --> 00:19:19,535
I don't mean to be rude,

364
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:23,235
but we can't take the testimony of a fiance just like that.

365
00:19:23,235 --> 00:19:27,235
Moreover, our investigation shows that you were going with the victim, too.

366
00:19:27,235 --> 00:19:28,535
That's...

367
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:34,235
The other two seem to have had some trouble with the victim, too.

368
00:19:36,535 --> 00:19:38,735
Officer Tsuyama, they're here.

369
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:40,435
Is that the container that the peach was inside?

370
00:19:40,435 --> 00:19:43,635
Yes. It may have nothing to do with the incident,

371
00:19:43,635 --> 00:19:47,635
but we contacted you because we thought we should let you know about it.

372
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:49,835
It's not that we wanted to report this,

373
00:19:49,835 --> 00:19:52,635
but we figured we had to cooperate with your investigation.

374
00:19:52,635 --> 00:19:54,535
Is that...

375
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:57,835
Our time capsule with the code we entered?

376
00:19:57,835 --> 00:20:00,035
What a surprise.

377
00:20:00,035 --> 00:20:01,435
The code was what specified the place

378
00:20:01,435 --> 00:20:06,135
in which they hid their time capsules 15 years ago.

379
00:20:06,135 --> 00:20:10,635
15 years ago, they put things their precious items inside a time capsule

380
00:20:10,635 --> 00:20:11,735
and after exchanging them,

381
00:20:11,735 --> 00:20:15,235
each person buried a capsule other than his own.

382
00:20:15,235 --> 00:20:19,635
They make it so that the owners didn't know where it was buried.

383
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:24,735
That's the reason why they were able to leave their true feelings behind.

384
00:20:24,735 --> 00:20:28,135
The fact is that last night the elementary school

385
00:20:28,135 --> 00:20:30,835
that you all attended was raided by someone.

386
00:20:31,935 --> 00:20:35,935
This container was also included among the things that were damaged.

387
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:41,435
Then, we received word from them that they picked this up.

388
00:20:41,435 --> 00:20:44,935
It must be some work of fate that we ran into you guys.

389
00:20:44,935 --> 00:20:47,635
But what are you going to do stealing something like that?

390
00:20:47,635 --> 00:20:49,135
That's why you threw it away, right?

391
00:20:49,135 --> 00:20:51,835
Because you figured it won't bring you any money.

392
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:54,535
Then, is this how it went, officer?

393
00:20:54,535 --> 00:20:57,535
Seiko, as a journalist happened to figure out

394
00:20:57,535 --> 00:20:59,335
who the culprit that raided the school was and was killed instead.

395
00:20:59,335 --> 00:21:02,535
-No. -That's unthinkable.

396
00:21:02,535 --> 00:21:05,335
We're looking at it from a different angle.

397
00:21:05,335 --> 00:21:07,935
Mr. Onitsura.

398
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:10,635
No! I didn't do it. I'm innocent!

399
00:21:10,635 --> 00:21:15,235
Don't get me wrong. At this point you're still only a major witness.

400
00:21:15,235 --> 00:21:18,235
Then, why am I the only who is being detained?

401
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:21,235
How would you explain this dying message?

402
00:21:21,235 --> 00:21:24,035
It seems that you were holding a grudge against the victim

403
00:21:24,035 --> 00:21:25,635
since she wrote an article about you that you didn't like.

404
00:21:29,535 --> 00:21:32,335
Hey, do you really think Mamoru did it?

405
00:21:32,335 --> 00:21:34,035
Cut it out, Saruwatari!

406
00:21:34,035 --> 00:21:35,435
Could be.

407
00:21:35,435 --> 00:21:36,935
How dare you talk like that, Momoi?

408
00:21:36,935 --> 00:21:38,535
These days,

409
00:21:38,535 --> 00:21:41,535
it's not surprising who kills who.

410
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,735
This is no time to be treasure hunting.

411
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:54,035
So the killer is an ogre after all.

412
00:21:54,035 --> 00:21:56,435
I sure wish we could catch it!

413
00:21:58,335 --> 00:22:01,135
Genta, you're holding the silverware with wrong hands!

414
00:22:01,135 --> 00:22:03,635
Hold the knife with your right hand and your fork with your left.

415
00:22:03,635 --> 00:22:06,935
What's the different? After all, I'm right handed.

416
00:22:06,935 --> 00:22:10,135
So I want to hold my fork with my right hand.

417
00:22:10,135 --> 00:22:11,635
Do you want to ask for chopsticks?

418
00:22:11,635 --> 00:22:14,335
Why didn't you do so in the first place, Doc?

419
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,235
I see. So that's it.

420
00:22:19,235 --> 00:22:22,535
If so, the contents of the dying message would change.

421
00:22:22,535 --> 00:22:24,235
Now I'm sure,

422
00:22:24,235 --> 00:22:27,235
the killer is among the four of them!

423
00:22:27,235 --> 00:22:29,035
But in order to specify who it is,

424
00:22:29,035 --> 00:22:31,035
the remaining two codes will have to be solved

425
00:22:31,035 --> 00:22:33,935
and the buried time capsule needs to be found.

426
00:24:31,862 --> 00:24:34,062
Next Conan's Hint:

427
00:24:34,062 --> 00:24:36,162
"Left-handed"

428
00:24:36,162 --> 00:24:37,162
In the next episode, we finally defeat the ogre!

429
00:24:37,162 --> 00:24:39,762
Conan, give me some more millet dumplings.
