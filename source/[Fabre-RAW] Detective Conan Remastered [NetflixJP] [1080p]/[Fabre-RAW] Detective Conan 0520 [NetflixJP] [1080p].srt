1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,460
The start of the age of mystery.

2
00:00:06,604 --> 00:00:10,404
The deeply mysterious message in the very expensive wine.

3
00:00:10,404 --> 00:00:11,904
He sees through the one and only truth.

4
00:00:11,904 --> 00:00:14,004
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

5
00:00:14,004 --> 00:00:16,604
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

6
00:01:52,757 --> 00:01:57,957
"Accusation in Wine Red"

7
00:02:07,357 --> 00:02:09,557
Greetings, Mr. Shiratori.

8
00:02:09,557 --> 00:02:11,757
Welcome to my retreat.

9
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:15,257
"Murozou Honjyou (42)" -I hope you enjoy tonight's celebration.

10
00:02:15,257 --> 00:02:18,857
Thank you for inviting me.

11
00:02:18,857 --> 00:02:20,757
By the way, where is Mr. Mouri?

12
00:02:21,757 --> 00:02:22,957
Right over here,

13
00:02:22,957 --> 00:02:24,357
and I have Grand Vin.

14
00:02:24,357 --> 00:02:25,557
Dad.

15
00:02:27,057 --> 00:02:30,257
You can't shake the wine like that.

16
00:02:30,257 --> 00:02:31,257
Why?

17
00:02:31,257 --> 00:02:33,057
It will take time for the dregs

18
00:02:33,057 --> 00:02:34,857
to settle back down into the bottle.

19
00:02:34,857 --> 00:02:35,857
Dregs?

20
00:02:35,857 --> 00:02:37,557
Dregs are the tannins and pigmentation

21
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,757
that collect at the bottom of the bottle

22
00:02:39,757 --> 00:02:41,757
and change the taste of the wine.

23
00:02:44,057 --> 00:02:46,357
It is all right.

24
00:02:46,357 --> 00:02:49,857
But having you here is such an honor.

25
00:02:49,857 --> 00:02:52,757
Mr. Hirose would be pleased to see you.

26
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:55,157
The honor is mine to be here for Mr. Hirose's 70th birthday celebration.

27
00:02:55,157 --> 00:02:57,757
I know that he is the president of the National Wine Association

28
00:02:57,757 --> 00:03:00,657
and the recipient of a prestigious French medal.

29
00:03:00,657 --> 00:03:04,657
This is very exciting for me.

30
00:03:05,857 --> 00:03:07,957
-You over there. -Yes.

31
00:03:07,957 --> 00:03:12,257
Can you explain tonight's arrangement to Mr. Mouri?

32
00:03:12,257 --> 00:03:17,357
I was wondering if you could do a skit for tonight...

33
00:03:17,357 --> 00:03:18,557
What do you think Mr. Mouri?

34
00:03:18,557 --> 00:03:20,157
Of course.

35
00:03:21,457 --> 00:03:22,557
Excuse me for a second.

36
00:03:23,557 --> 00:03:26,257
This is the scenario.

37
00:03:26,257 --> 00:03:28,257
Dad, are you sure about this?

38
00:03:28,257 --> 00:03:30,457
Leave it to me.

39
00:03:30,457 --> 00:03:31,857
Oh, really?

40
00:03:32,857 --> 00:03:35,857
You have hidden in the trunk of the car.

41
00:03:35,857 --> 00:03:38,057
The culprit is you.

42
00:03:38,057 --> 00:03:42,957
No, there should be another line before that.

43
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:44,357
Oh, yes.

44
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,957
Oh, bother. Why me?

45
00:03:49,957 --> 00:03:52,557
You can take the ropeway up to the peak of the mountain.

46
00:03:52,557 --> 00:03:54,157
The view is amazing.

47
00:03:54,157 --> 00:03:55,357
You should take a stroll outside.

48
00:03:55,357 --> 00:03:56,757
I think we will.

49
00:03:56,757 --> 00:03:57,957
Let's go, Conan.

50
00:03:57,957 --> 00:03:58,957
Okay.

51
00:04:04,157 --> 00:04:07,057
What are you doing here without an invitation?

52
00:04:07,057 --> 00:04:09,057
Are you here to cause some trouble?

53
00:04:09,057 --> 00:04:11,257
Speak up, Akamaru.

54
00:04:11,257 --> 00:04:16,357
"Goro Akamaru (50)" -I hear you have the Magnum 1959 Petrus.

55
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:21,057
Yes, a wine that probably you can never taste in your lifetime.

56
00:04:22,257 --> 00:04:24,657
Can you really understand the taste?

57
00:04:24,657 --> 00:04:27,657
I know you couldn't even tell

58
00:04:27,657 --> 00:04:29,557
the taste of a slightly different Neuf du Pape.

59
00:04:30,557 --> 00:04:34,057
Well, poor Mr. Hirose.

60
00:04:34,057 --> 00:04:36,857
It is his 70th birthday.

61
00:04:36,857 --> 00:04:39,857
I should have been the one to present this party.

62
00:04:39,857 --> 00:04:40,857
Shut up.

63
00:04:42,957 --> 00:04:45,657
Conan, let's go.

64
00:04:45,657 --> 00:04:46,657
Okay.

65
00:04:49,157 --> 00:04:54,057
Today is the day that everyone will see who you really are.

66
00:04:54,057 --> 00:04:57,157
Go and make a fool of yourself out there.

67
00:04:57,157 --> 00:04:58,457
Conan.

68
00:05:11,457 --> 00:05:12,657
What's the matter?

69
00:05:12,657 --> 00:05:13,657
Look.

70
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,557
I can't see anything.

71
00:05:21,457 --> 00:05:24,557
"When you couldn't find anywhere to put the body,

72
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:27,757
you hid the body inside the trunk of the car."

73
00:05:29,057 --> 00:05:32,057
"But your wife who didn't have the slightest idea

74
00:05:32,057 --> 00:05:35,157
drove the car..."

75
00:05:41,857 --> 00:05:44,357
"Don"t underestimate me.

76
00:05:44,357 --> 00:05:46,857
I am the one and only Detective Kogorou Mouri."

77
00:05:46,857 --> 00:05:48,657
Excuse me.

78
00:05:48,657 --> 00:05:49,757
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:51,757 --> 00:05:54,057
That was a quick walk.

80
00:05:54,057 --> 00:05:57,557
We were going to take time,

81
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:00,557
but Conan said he had a stomachache.

82
00:06:16,057 --> 00:06:17,557
What are you doing?

83
00:06:17,557 --> 00:06:18,857
I...

84
00:06:18,857 --> 00:06:21,157
I was looking for something.

85
00:06:21,157 --> 00:06:23,757
I guess I left it somewhere inside the house.

86
00:06:25,057 --> 00:06:26,857
Where should I put this?

87
00:06:26,857 --> 00:06:28,957
Oh, right. There is fine.

88
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:34,657
Excuse me, do you think that man knows where it is?

89
00:06:34,657 --> 00:06:38,057
The man that had white hair and yellow jacket on.

90
00:06:38,057 --> 00:06:40,657
You were talking to him.

91
00:06:40,657 --> 00:06:43,657
Yes. We had some business to deal with.

92
00:06:43,657 --> 00:06:45,357
But, he went home already.

93
00:06:45,357 --> 00:06:46,857
I see.

94
00:06:55,557 --> 00:06:58,857
"Of course, I cannot say that you are the culprit

95
00:06:58,857 --> 00:07:00,657
by just assessing the situation."

96
00:07:00,657 --> 00:07:02,557
And...

97
00:07:02,557 --> 00:07:04,457
"We need..."

98
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,657
"We need some evidence."

99
00:07:10,057 --> 00:07:11,257
Did you find it?

100
00:07:11,257 --> 00:07:12,557
No.

101
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,357
Do you know when they arrived here?

102
00:07:15,357 --> 00:07:16,757
At 4 o'clock, I think.

103
00:07:51,157 --> 00:07:52,557
I was looking for...

104
00:07:52,557 --> 00:07:54,357
Again?

105
00:07:54,357 --> 00:07:58,757
Is it a hamster or something that you are looking for?

106
00:07:58,757 --> 00:08:01,557
It must be really hard to find.

107
00:08:01,557 --> 00:08:03,557
No, it's a ball.

108
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,857
You can only enter here with Mr. Honjou's fingerprint.

109
00:08:13,857 --> 00:08:15,557
Fingerprint recognition system.

110
00:08:15,557 --> 00:08:17,257
So only Mr. Honjou can enter here.

111
00:08:17,257 --> 00:08:18,457
I guess.

112
00:08:20,657 --> 00:08:21,657
Stop right there.

113
00:08:25,357 --> 00:08:28,857
Mr. Koike, don't worry about the preparations for the party.

114
00:08:28,857 --> 00:08:32,257
Can you go and find this ball this child is looking for?

115
00:08:32,257 --> 00:08:37,157
And you can go upstairs and watch TV while you wait.

116
00:08:37,157 --> 00:08:38,157
Okay.

117
00:08:39,157 --> 00:08:42,657
Masked Yaiba.

118
00:08:47,557 --> 00:08:50,057
Do you like Yaiba too?

119
00:08:50,057 --> 00:08:52,357
My grandchildren love them too.

120
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:54,357
They're going to be in kindergarten this year.

121
00:08:54,357 --> 00:08:56,657
I like him too.

122
00:08:57,957 --> 00:09:01,357
I can't do this. The lines are too long.

123
00:09:01,357 --> 00:09:04,357
I told you if you were sure you could do this.

124
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:09,857
I can ask Mr. Honjou if he can change it to a regular speech?

125
00:09:09,857 --> 00:09:11,357
That would be great.

126
00:09:22,557 --> 00:09:24,557
Conan.

127
00:09:24,557 --> 00:09:26,457
How is your stomachache?

128
00:09:27,757 --> 00:09:29,057
It's not so bad.

129
00:09:32,457 --> 00:09:34,057
But I need to go again.

130
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:35,457
Conan.

131
00:09:37,157 --> 00:09:41,357
Mr. Honjou, do you think you can change Mr. Mouri's skit

132
00:09:41,357 --> 00:09:43,657
to a regular speech for tonight?

133
00:09:43,657 --> 00:09:46,157
He cannot remember all the lines.

134
00:09:46,157 --> 00:09:49,557
That is too bad, but of course.

135
00:09:49,557 --> 00:09:53,357
Do you think I can have a moment with you, Mr. Mouri?

136
00:10:28,457 --> 00:10:29,757
This is...

137
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:36,857
I see. He did hide Mr. Akamaru here first,

138
00:10:36,857 --> 00:10:39,157
but thought I would find it somehow,

139
00:10:39,157 --> 00:10:42,257
so he moved the body.

140
00:10:42,257 --> 00:10:45,057
A place that is completely safe.

141
00:10:45,057 --> 00:10:46,757
It must be the wine cellar.

142
00:10:56,847 --> 00:11:01,547
Thank you for traveling so far, Mr. Hirose.

143
00:11:01,547 --> 00:11:04,447
I am the one to thank you.

144
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:08,647
"Shinya Hirose (70)" -This is such a huge party.

145
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:10,747
Mr. Honjou, everyone,

146
00:11:10,747 --> 00:11:12,347
thank you so much.

147
00:11:12,347 --> 00:11:14,647
That over there is Mr. Hirose,

148
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:16,647
the president of the National Wine Association

149
00:11:16,647 --> 00:11:18,547
and the main guest for tonight.

150
00:11:19,547 --> 00:11:21,947
That's the medal from France.

151
00:11:24,047 --> 00:11:26,547
To Mr. Hirose. Celebrating his 70th birthday

152
00:11:26,547 --> 00:11:30,947
and for his continuing success. Cheers.

153
00:11:30,947 --> 00:11:32,347
-Cheers. -Cheers.

154
00:11:40,947 --> 00:11:42,147
It's delicious.

155
00:11:42,147 --> 00:11:45,547
Mr. Mouri, don't forget about your speech.

156
00:11:48,247 --> 00:11:54,347
Let's now savor the highest-quality Bordeaux wines

157
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,147
that I have chosen for this evening.

158
00:11:56,147 --> 00:12:00,147
A 1985 Chateau Haut Brion.

159
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,947
Is that expensive?

160
00:12:03,947 --> 00:12:08,747
Yes. It costs more than 100,000 Yen.

161
00:12:08,747 --> 00:12:10,747
I am looking forward to this.

162
00:12:10,747 --> 00:12:14,047
It's not only the price that makes a good wine, you know.

163
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:19,447
Here you are.

164
00:12:30,347 --> 00:12:34,047
Very soft and elegant.

165
00:12:35,347 --> 00:12:36,347
Delicious.

166
00:12:36,347 --> 00:12:39,147
Mr. Mouri, you also enjoy the smell

167
00:12:39,147 --> 00:12:42,747
and color of the wine too.

168
00:12:42,747 --> 00:12:49,047
Next, we have a 1982 Chateau Mouton Rothschild.

169
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,147
That is a beautiful label.

170
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,047
They call it an "Etiquette"

171
00:12:54,047 --> 00:12:55,347
Etiquette?

172
00:12:55,347 --> 00:12:56,347
Yes.

173
00:12:56,347 --> 00:13:01,647
Every year the Mouton has different artists for the artwork.

174
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:04,747
They are known for their artistic designs.

175
00:13:04,747 --> 00:13:09,147
Chagall drew their etiquette for 1970.

176
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:10,447
Wow.

177
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:14,747
This is a 1992 Chateau Le Pin.

178
00:13:14,747 --> 00:13:19,347
A 1986 Chateau Lafite Rothschild.

179
00:13:19,347 --> 00:13:22,347
And a 1990 Chateau Margaux.

180
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:32,647
Congratulations, Mr. Hirose.

181
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,547
Tell me about the incident

182
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:38,347
that occurred in Shouhei Kusaka's wine cellar.

183
00:13:38,347 --> 00:13:40,847
Well, I can say that without me,

184
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:42,947
that case might have gone unsolved.

185
00:13:44,347 --> 00:13:47,147
Mr. Hirose, would you excuse me for a second?

186
00:13:47,147 --> 00:13:48,947
Mr. Honjou.

187
00:13:48,947 --> 00:13:50,247
Yes?

188
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:53,047
I do not see Mr. Akamaru anywhere.

189
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,047
Who is Mr. Akamaru?

190
00:13:56,047 --> 00:14:00,947
He is a French translator and a famous wine critic.

191
00:14:00,947 --> 00:14:03,147
He was here at 3 o'clock.

192
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:07,447
And why do you know that?

193
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:09,447
I just saw him earlier.

194
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:10,647
Right?

195
00:14:10,647 --> 00:14:11,747
Yes.

196
00:14:12,747 --> 00:14:16,147
He said that he was sorry

197
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:19,047
that he could not be here for the celebration.

198
00:14:19,047 --> 00:14:21,647
I see, that is too bad.

199
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:23,647
I will have to prepare for the next presentation.

200
00:14:29,447 --> 00:14:31,947
And, about that incident...

201
00:14:31,947 --> 00:14:33,647
Yes, yes.

202
00:14:33,647 --> 00:14:34,947
Conan.

203
00:14:34,947 --> 00:14:35,947
Huh?

204
00:14:35,947 --> 00:14:38,347
Conan said he had a stomachache earlier.

205
00:14:38,347 --> 00:14:41,447
Probably drank too much juice.

206
00:14:44,847 --> 00:14:47,147
Dad, are you okay?

207
00:14:49,947 --> 00:14:51,147
That was a close one.

208
00:14:52,147 --> 00:14:53,847
Nothing... Everything is okay...

209
00:14:53,847 --> 00:14:55,247
No problem.

210
00:14:57,347 --> 00:14:58,347
Hey, little boy.

211
00:14:59,947 --> 00:15:02,847
Is this what you've been looking for?

212
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:05,447
It was in the corner of the parking lot.

213
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:08,547
Yes, this is it. Thank you.

214
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:15,047
For half a century,

215
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:18,047
this wine has been waiting for us.

216
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:21,747
This is a gem in a bottle.

217
00:15:21,747 --> 00:15:27,247
A 1959 magunum bottle of Chteau Petrus.

218
00:15:27,247 --> 00:15:29,247
A 1959?

219
00:15:29,247 --> 00:15:30,447
Magunum?

220
00:15:32,447 --> 00:15:36,447
And I present this to you, Mr. Hirose.

221
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,847
Thank you Mr. Honjou.

222
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:41,347
This is a great pleasure.

223
00:15:41,347 --> 00:15:44,047
This wine should have been uncorked

224
00:15:44,047 --> 00:15:46,947
and decanted a few hours ago

225
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,847
But when it comes to a wine of this caliber,

226
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:52,547
it should be fully enjoyable even if we uncork it now.

227
00:15:59,247 --> 00:16:01,247
What is this?

228
00:16:01,247 --> 00:16:03,747
Dad, you did do something.

229
00:16:03,747 --> 00:16:06,147
I'm terribly sorry.

230
00:16:06,147 --> 00:16:08,247
There was an accident.

231
00:16:09,747 --> 00:16:11,947
That's all right.

232
00:16:11,947 --> 00:16:13,547
After half a century,

233
00:16:13,547 --> 00:16:15,747
even if I pour it directly into the glasses,

234
00:16:15,747 --> 00:16:19,547
I contend that we will find it just as satisfactory.

235
00:16:19,547 --> 00:16:21,147
Will that be okay?

236
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,947
Wine should be treated like a woman.

237
00:16:27,147 --> 00:16:28,747
For you Mr. Hirose.

238
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:46,347
What is the matter?

239
00:16:46,347 --> 00:16:48,847
The dregs have been mixed.

240
00:16:48,847 --> 00:16:51,047
The flavor is off too.

241
00:16:51,047 --> 00:16:52,647
That cannot be.

242
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:04,047
May I?

243
00:17:04,047 --> 00:17:05,147
Of course.

244
00:17:06,147 --> 00:17:07,147
Thank you.

245
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,147
You are right.

246
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:16,047
Why?

247
00:17:16,047 --> 00:17:17,747
Did you shake the bottle?

248
00:17:17,747 --> 00:17:20,247
I wouldn't do such a thing. I am not an amateur.

249
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:23,347
Perhaps the temperature in the storeroom got too high.

250
00:17:23,347 --> 00:17:25,247
That's also impossible.

251
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,847
The temperature in the storeroom

252
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:29,447
is kept perfectly regulated through computer control.

253
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:31,747
Then it is a mystery.

254
00:17:42,947 --> 00:17:45,847
This maybe...

255
00:17:46,847 --> 00:17:50,147
Being mocked by Mr. Akamaru,

256
00:17:50,147 --> 00:17:52,447
Mr. Honjou killed him in rage

257
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:56,447
and hid him inside the barrel by the tennis court.

258
00:17:56,447 --> 00:17:59,447
But when he noticed that I was sniffing around the house,

259
00:17:59,447 --> 00:18:01,547
he decided to move the body to safer place.

260
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,947
He moved it from the tennis court to the wine cellar.

261
00:18:07,147 --> 00:18:11,347
But Mr. Akamaru was still alive.

262
00:18:17,747 --> 00:18:23,047
And he noticed the Petrus kept in the cellar.

263
00:18:23,047 --> 00:18:24,547
Petrus.

264
00:18:38,347 --> 00:18:41,447
Try this, Honjou.

265
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:47,047
Judging that Mr. Akamaru hasn't shown up,

266
00:18:47,047 --> 00:18:50,447
he might be unconscious, or worse...

267
00:18:52,247 --> 00:18:55,347
How do I get inside the wine cellar?

268
00:18:55,347 --> 00:18:58,047
Only Mr. Honjou can open it.

269
00:18:59,247 --> 00:19:00,247
I know.

270
00:19:04,247 --> 00:19:06,747
I don't know how it...

271
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:12,147
The wine is getting to me...

272
00:19:14,447 --> 00:19:15,747
Dad.

273
00:19:17,147 --> 00:19:20,347
Is this the famous "Sleeping Kogorou"?

274
00:19:22,247 --> 00:19:23,747
That is the famous...

275
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:27,647
Mr. Honjou, it seems like you have fallen into a trap.

276
00:19:27,647 --> 00:19:29,947
-A trap? -Yes.

277
00:19:29,947 --> 00:19:32,647
Someone in this party who is jealous of you

278
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:35,247
must have come to this party to embarrass you.

279
00:19:35,247 --> 00:19:38,147
They sneaked into your wine cellar

280
00:19:38,147 --> 00:19:40,947
to ruin the wine you have just served.

281
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:44,347
That's right. That must be it.

282
00:19:45,647 --> 00:19:47,247
Who did it?

283
00:19:48,347 --> 00:19:50,347
But that's impossible.

284
00:19:50,347 --> 00:19:52,547
In order to get into the wine storeroom,

285
00:19:52,547 --> 00:19:55,047
they would have to use my fingerprints to unlock the system.

286
00:19:55,047 --> 00:19:56,747
Most likely the culprit

287
00:19:56,747 --> 00:20:00,347
is someone who's familiar with the security system.

288
00:20:00,347 --> 00:20:04,547
And it's possible they might still be hiding in there,

289
00:20:04,547 --> 00:20:07,347
which is where the remaining wine is.

290
00:20:07,347 --> 00:20:09,147
That would be horrible.

291
00:20:09,147 --> 00:20:12,447
We have to stop that from happening.

292
00:20:12,447 --> 00:20:14,447
Let's go to the cellar now.

293
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:16,747
Oh no. I can go alone.

294
00:20:16,747 --> 00:20:18,047
It's dangerous.

295
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:21,147
We don't know what this culprit is capable of.

296
00:20:21,147 --> 00:20:22,847
And we do not want to lose any more wine

297
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:26,147
while we try to get them.

298
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:27,147
But...

299
00:20:27,147 --> 00:20:29,147
-I will go too. -Me too.

300
00:20:29,147 --> 00:20:32,047
-We should hurry. -Where is the wine cellar?

301
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:40,147
Mr. Akamaru. Mr. Akamaru.

302
00:20:40,147 --> 00:20:41,847
Can you hear me?

303
00:20:41,847 --> 00:20:42,847
Mr. Akamaru.

304
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:46,247
Call the ambulance.

305
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:47,647
Yes. Right away.

306
00:20:49,847 --> 00:20:53,347
What is all this, Mr. Honjou?

307
00:20:53,347 --> 00:20:55,747
I... I...

308
00:20:55,747 --> 00:20:58,847
Mr. Honjou, I will notify the police.

309
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:07,147
He always mocked me.

310
00:21:07,147 --> 00:21:10,547
Said that I have no class or education

311
00:21:10,547 --> 00:21:14,447
to present myself as a wine lover.

312
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:19,247
Mr. Honjou, do you really love wine?

313
00:21:19,247 --> 00:21:20,847
Yes, I do.

314
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:23,247
Well, I don't think so.

315
00:21:23,247 --> 00:21:27,847
The wine cellar is a sacred place for the wine lover.

316
00:21:27,847 --> 00:21:30,647
And to use that to cover up a crime

317
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:31,647
is unforgivable.

318
00:21:37,147 --> 00:21:40,347
Luckily, Mr. Akamaru was stabilized.

319
00:21:40,347 --> 00:21:43,347
And the case was closed.

320
00:21:43,347 --> 00:21:47,547
Perhaps the true victim in this case might be

321
00:21:47,547 --> 00:21:50,247
the bottle whose taste was ruined when it got involved

322
00:21:50,247 --> 00:21:52,447
in the dirty infighting between humans...

323
00:21:52,447 --> 00:21:54,847
That bottle of wine.

324
00:23:20,347 --> 00:23:22,847
"Mouri Detective Agency" -The sweetness, the soft flavor.

325
00:23:22,847 --> 00:23:25,547
Vintage wine does make the difference.

326
00:23:28,147 --> 00:23:29,747
How much was that wine?

327
00:23:29,747 --> 00:23:31,047
It was 10,000 yen,

328
00:23:31,047 --> 00:23:36,247
but I had the people at the store switch it to a 1000 yen bottle.

329
00:23:43,247 --> 00:23:44,947
"Tres Bien"

330
00:23:45,947 --> 00:23:49,647
It's lucky for us that you can't recognize the taste.

331
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,420
Next Conan's Hint:

332
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,160
"Shinichi Kudo".
