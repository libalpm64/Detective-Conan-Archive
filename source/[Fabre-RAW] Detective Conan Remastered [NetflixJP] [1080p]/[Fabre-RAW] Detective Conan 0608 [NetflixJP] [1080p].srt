1
00:00:05,102 --> 00:00:06,902
"Urai"

2
00:00:06,902 --> 00:00:09,202
What's with this chocolate?

3
00:00:09,202 --> 00:00:11,402
My! You should at least be aware of

4
00:00:11,402 --> 00:00:13,402
the new chocolate products that your company sells.

5
00:00:13,402 --> 00:00:15,002
Yeah.

6
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:17,602
The Spy Choco White that we'll be selling

7
00:00:17,602 --> 00:00:19,702
from March for White Day.

8
00:00:19,702 --> 00:00:21,002
Yes.

9
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:22,902
An even sourer chocolate

10
00:00:22,902 --> 00:00:24,502
than the favoured Spy Choco Black.

11
00:00:24,502 --> 00:00:26,802
It's very sour white chocolate.

12
00:00:26,802 --> 00:00:29,002
"Taruto Urai (53), Urai Confections President" -Hey, hey. Don't tell me

13
00:00:29,002 --> 00:00:32,002
that you want me to test taste the chocolate.

14
00:00:32,002 --> 00:00:35,202
You know that I don't take to sour things, do you?

15
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,202
I've been telling you from before

16
00:00:37,202 --> 00:00:38,502
that I'm in charge of the sweet stuff

17
00:00:38,502 --> 00:00:41,402
and you, the vice-president's in charge of the sour stuff.

18
00:00:41,402 --> 00:00:45,602
Don't take my word for it, but I promise it's good so taste one.

19
00:00:45,602 --> 00:00:49,102
"Hoshie Urai (49), Taruto Urai's wife" -Maybe you'd be okay with it by now.

20
00:00:49,102 --> 00:00:51,102
No way.

21
00:00:51,102 --> 00:00:53,202
I got sick over the citrus fruit cake

22
00:00:53,202 --> 00:00:56,502
that you made for fun the other day too, didn't I?

23
00:00:57,602 --> 00:00:59,002
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:02,602
I was just trying to remedy your hate for sour things.

25
00:01:02,602 --> 00:01:05,702
By the way, did you think up something

26
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:08,302
for my speech tonight?

27
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:10,402
For March 14th?

28
00:01:10,402 --> 00:01:11,602
The kind of idea

29
00:01:11,602 --> 00:01:14,053
that will surprise the guests that we have invited to the party

30
00:01:14,302 --> 00:01:18,057
out of their wits and liven it up?

31
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:20,602
I've got one such idea,

32
00:01:20,602 --> 00:01:21,802
would you like to try it out?

33
00:01:21,802 --> 00:01:25,202
I'm sure everyone will really be surprised.

34
00:01:25,202 --> 00:01:27,502
Something that'll make their eyes pop out?

35
00:01:27,502 --> 00:01:31,502
Yes, I think you yourself will be very surprised too.

36
00:01:34,073 --> 00:01:36,075
So much that you'll die.

37
00:01:37,202 --> 00:01:39,102
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

38
00:01:39,102 --> 00:01:41,502
Tears are start of all dramas.

39
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:43,102
In exchange for sour chocolate

40
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:45,002
is the aroma of a crime on White Day.

41
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:46,702
He sees through the one and only truth.

42
00:01:46,702 --> 00:01:48,702
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

43
00:01:48,702 --> 00:01:51,702
His name is Detective Conan!

44
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:35,912
"White Day of Betrayal (Part 1)".

45
00:03:49,712 --> 00:03:52,612
Darn! Out of the 24-hour time limit that I had,

46
00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:54,512
I've only got less than an hour!

47
00:03:54,512 --> 00:03:57,812
I've got to search up the spy within the amount of time left

48
00:03:57,812 --> 00:03:59,612
or everything will go down the drain!

49
00:04:02,712 --> 00:04:04,223
Just what do you think you're doing?

50
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:05,412
The four blocks in this area

51
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,712
are being closed off! Hurry!

52
00:04:07,712 --> 00:04:10,812
Hey, is that information you got verified?

53
00:04:10,812 --> 00:04:13,112
Yes! The spy is black!

54
00:04:13,112 --> 00:04:15,412
Don't make me repeat myself!

55
00:04:15,412 --> 00:04:16,612
If the spy's black...

56
00:04:16,612 --> 00:04:20,612
Then why are all the chocolates white?

57
00:04:23,212 --> 00:04:26,012
Sour!

58
00:04:27,412 --> 00:04:30,512
This time it's an even sourer spy choco white!

59
00:04:30,512 --> 00:04:32,512
It's popular and in stores now!

60
00:04:32,512 --> 00:04:34,512
Don't forget the original spy choco black too.

61
00:04:34,512 --> 00:04:37,512
Your dad's pretty good, Ran.

62
00:04:37,512 --> 00:04:40,259
Moreover, he's acting together with his beloved Yoko

63
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:41,912
on a TV AD too.

64
00:04:41,912 --> 00:04:44,263
He must be on cloud nine!

65
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:45,412
Nope.

66
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:48,267
He keeps complaining that his face is barely recognizable

67
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:49,612
because of the hat and sunglasses he wore.

68
00:04:49,612 --> 00:04:52,012
But, thanks to that commercial,

69
00:04:52,012 --> 00:04:56,275
we were invited to the White Day party by its manufacturer, right?

70
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:57,912
Was the party tonight?

71
00:04:57,912 --> 00:05:01,712
Yes. At Haido City Hotel starting from 18:00.

72
00:05:01,712 --> 00:05:05,712
I hear that the company was established on March 14th.

73
00:05:07,212 --> 00:05:09,112
Talking about White Day,

74
00:05:09,112 --> 00:05:11,512
did you receive anything, Ran?

75
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:14,012
A gift in return from Shinichi.

76
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:20,812
You gave him hand-made Valentine's chocolate too, didn't you, Ran?

77
00:05:20,812 --> 00:05:22,812
Well, I did sort of give it to him.

78
00:05:22,812 --> 00:05:25,612
Or rather, he ate it without permission.

79
00:05:27,612 --> 00:05:30,612
I wonder if Kygyoku's going to give me something,

80
00:05:30,612 --> 00:05:32,311
in return on White Day.

81
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:36,315
It seems that boys are not as concerned about it as girls, though.

82
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:40,812
They may not even know about White Day.

83
00:05:40,812 --> 00:05:42,321
True.

84
00:05:43,412 --> 00:05:45,612
If you give somebody chocolate on Valentine's Day,

85
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:48,327
you get a return gift on March 14th!

86
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:50,612
That's good news.

87
00:05:50,612 --> 00:05:52,331
Officer Sato!

88
00:05:52,512 --> 00:05:55,712
Okay, then, Officer Takagi!

89
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:59,712
I didn't get any chocolate from you, Officer Sato.

90
00:05:59,712 --> 00:06:02,712
I was really waiting for one and yet...

91
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:04,612
I gave you, remember?

92
00:06:04,612 --> 00:06:07,812
On February 14th when we were on a stakeout.

93
00:06:07,812 --> 00:06:08,812
You want?

94
00:06:10,812 --> 00:06:12,712
You mean that?

95
00:06:12,712 --> 00:06:14,353
It was half-eaten!

96
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:15,612
Officer Takagi.

97
00:06:15,612 --> 00:06:17,112
Chocolates like crimes,

98
00:06:17,112 --> 00:06:19,412
have no big or small or half eaten to them, you know.

99
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,312
About that...

100
00:06:24,012 --> 00:06:25,512
Hey, everyone!

101
00:06:25,512 --> 00:06:27,812
Have you finished the investigation and asking questions?

102
00:06:27,812 --> 00:06:29,312
Mr. Shiratori!

103
00:06:30,712 --> 00:06:34,112
What's with that box?

104
00:06:34,112 --> 00:06:38,112
It's a White Day gift I'm giving to Ms. Kobayashi.

105
00:06:38,112 --> 00:06:42,381
Well, I was trying to make up my mind on whether to give her

106
00:06:42,612 --> 00:06:44,383
biscuits, candies, white chocolates or marshmallows

107
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,012
that the box kept getting larger.

108
00:06:47,012 --> 00:06:48,912
I'll see you all then!

109
00:06:50,812 --> 00:06:52,391
Just as would be expected of Mr. Shiratori.

110
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,812
He's got love.

111
00:06:54,812 --> 00:06:57,512
In the meantime, I wonder what Officer Takagi was doing.

112
00:06:57,512 --> 00:07:01,812
I'm sorry, I'm so thoughtless!

113

"Mouri Detective Agency"

114
00:07:05,112 --> 00:07:07,412
What's the matter, Conan?

115
00:07:07,412 --> 00:07:09,612
I'm sorry, I forgot something.

116
00:07:09,612 --> 00:07:11,312
Go ahead on the cab without me!

117
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:17,012
Come to think of it,

118
00:07:17,012 --> 00:07:18,712
are you over with your cold already?

119
00:07:18,712 --> 00:07:20,412
You were a bit nasal, right?

120
00:07:20,412 --> 00:07:22,812
Yep, I'm fine already!

121
00:07:22,812 --> 00:07:25,312

122
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:29,512
What? Yoko Okino can't come?

123
00:07:29,512 --> 00:07:30,912
Are you serious?

124
00:07:30,912 --> 00:07:32,812
Yes, we got word just a while ago

125
00:07:32,812 --> 00:07:34,112
because the take for the drama

126
00:07:34,112 --> 00:07:36,435
is taking longer than expected, so she can't come.

127
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:39,912
And I brought her a White Day gift too.

128
00:07:39,912 --> 00:07:41,312
What's that about?

129
00:07:41,312 --> 00:07:44,443
Mom nor I got one yet.

130
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:47,012
Hello there, great detective.

131
00:07:48,112 --> 00:07:51,212
Welcome to Urai Confections 8th Anniversary Party.

132
00:07:51,212 --> 00:07:55,812
Who may I ask are you?

133
00:07:55,812 --> 00:07:59,112
I'm President of Urai Confections, Taruto Urai.

134
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:01,512
I think we've never met before.

135
00:08:01,512 --> 00:08:03,512
President?

136
00:08:03,512 --> 00:08:07,112
And this is my wife and vice-president.

137
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:10,469
I'm Hoshie. It's an honor to see you,

138
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:12,812
Mr. Sleeping Kogoro.

139
00:08:12,812 --> 00:08:15,612
Well, hello.

140
00:08:21,812 --> 00:08:24,483
How gorgeous!

141
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:25,912
Really.

142
00:08:25,912 --> 00:08:27,812
Look at all the people, Conan.

143
00:08:27,812 --> 00:08:28,812
Yeah.

144
00:08:29,912 --> 00:08:31,312
Come along!

145
00:08:31,312 --> 00:08:33,212
It's a buffet,

146
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:36,912
so help yourself to the food and drinks as you like.

147
00:08:36,912 --> 00:08:38,497
Yes, ma'am!

148
00:08:43,112 --> 00:08:44,512
Come over here, Ran.

149
00:08:44,512 --> 00:08:46,012
It's all kinds of food all you can eat!

150
00:08:46,012 --> 00:08:47,612
You'd better make yourself a plate right away too!

151
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:49,212
Fried prawns, fried prawns!

152
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:50,912
Hey, Dad, hold it.

153
00:08:50,912 --> 00:08:53,212
Pops, control yourself.

154
00:08:55,812 --> 00:08:56,912
It's good!

155
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:58,517
Just as expected of the Haido City Hotel,

156
00:08:58,712 --> 00:09:00,519
the food is top class too!

157
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:03,212
I wonder what they have in store for us.

158
00:09:03,212 --> 00:09:04,312
What?

159
00:09:04,312 --> 00:09:06,212
It's President Urai!

160
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,812
According to Sonoko,

161
00:09:07,812 --> 00:09:11,512
he does something interesting at every party.

162
00:09:11,512 --> 00:09:13,012
He does magic,

163
00:09:13,012 --> 00:09:15,612
or come out wearing the stuffed animal clothes that he wore on TV ads,

164
00:09:15,612 --> 00:09:19,612
or even do plays in the spotlight at times.

165
00:09:19,612 --> 00:09:23,612
So, I think everybody's anticipating what he'll do.

166
00:09:25,312 --> 00:09:27,112
A skit...

167
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:32,912
I've got to say that the commercial was great, involving great acting.

168
00:09:32,912 --> 00:09:34,112
Yes.

169
00:09:34,112 --> 00:09:36,912
I'm glad and was right to have used you to make that commercial.

170
00:09:36,912 --> 00:09:38,312
Well, well!

171
00:09:41,012 --> 00:09:44,112
The fact is, I asked Yoko to use you

172
00:09:44,112 --> 00:09:47,812
as her partner investigator.

173
00:09:47,812 --> 00:09:51,812
Well, she's into me, you see, so...

174
00:09:51,812 --> 00:09:53,412
Not true.

175
00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:54,573
Gosh.

176
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:55,412
Now, I'd like to introduce

177
00:09:55,412 --> 00:09:57,712
one of the star actors of the present commercial.

178
00:09:57,712 --> 00:10:01,012
We'd like the great Detective Kogoro Mouri to say a few words!

179
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:09,012
Well, hello there, everyone.

180
00:10:10,312 --> 00:10:12,591
-That's right, Ran. -Yes?

181
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:14,212
Would you like me to read your palm?

182
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:17,312
Palm reading?

183
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:20,599
I didn't know that you could read palms.

184
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:23,512
My, I read yours every time

185
00:10:23,512 --> 00:10:26,605
before I wake you up in the morning.

186
00:10:26,812 --> 00:10:29,912
Your lifeline is pretty short, so be careful

187
00:10:29,912 --> 00:10:31,712
that you don't pass on before your time comes.

188
00:10:31,712 --> 00:10:33,312
Hey, hey.

189
00:10:33,312 --> 00:10:36,212
Well, talking of Spy Chocolates,

190
00:10:36,212 --> 00:10:39,212
I would like to tell you a bit

191
00:10:39,212 --> 00:10:43,912
about the special jobs I goofed on so far as a detective.

192
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:48,412
My, Ran, you're very lucky, aren't you?

193
00:10:48,412 --> 00:10:50,629
You have a straight line going from right bottom of your palm

194
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:53,512
to the bottom of your little finger.

195
00:10:53,512 --> 00:10:55,612
I usually win at lotteries.

196
00:10:57,512 --> 00:10:59,712
So...

197
00:10:59,712 --> 00:11:02,641
how... how's my love life?

198
00:11:04,412 --> 00:11:10,312
Well, your marriage line is sideways in the shape of a Y.

199
00:11:10,312 --> 00:11:12,212
This means that you have to overcome many obstacles

200
00:11:12,212 --> 00:11:14,412
in order to get together with the one you love.

201
00:11:14,412 --> 00:11:17,412
You're going to be cornered into a doomed state of love.

202
00:11:17,412 --> 00:11:19,912
Hey! Hey! Hey!

203
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,312
Is it working?

204
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:24,212
Yes, I'm listening!

205
00:11:24,212 --> 00:11:26,412
No, you.

206
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:29,012
Yeah, I think so.

207
00:11:30,312 --> 00:11:34,112
But, finally after a dramatic turn of the tables,

208
00:11:34,112 --> 00:11:36,112
you two may become a couple,

209
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,212
so try not to get into too many fights with your boyfriend.

210
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:40,212
Okay.

211
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:56,312
Hey, what is it, Dear?

212
00:11:56,312 --> 00:11:59,012
Is this supposed to be your mystery skit?

213
00:12:03,712 --> 00:12:06,705
Detective Mouri, come here, please!

214
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:09,512
I guess it's showtime for you.

215
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:11,812
Yes?

216
00:12:11,812 --> 00:12:15,812
Why didn't they tell me beforehand?

217
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:19,812
Come on, he really looks like he's dead.

218
00:12:22,512 --> 00:12:28,012
So, the estimated time of death is 19:54.

219
00:12:28,012 --> 00:12:29,412
From my long experience as a detective

220
00:12:29,412 --> 00:12:31,312
and if my premonition is correct,

221
00:12:31,312 --> 00:12:36,012
the culprit is here without a doubt!

222
00:12:38,212 --> 00:12:41,612
And what after this?

223
00:12:41,612 --> 00:12:43,512
President Urai?

224
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,112
Hello! Hey!

225
00:12:46,112 --> 00:12:49,612
He can't answer no matter how much you call him.

226
00:12:49,612 --> 00:12:51,912
Because he's not breathing.

227
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:55,512
He... he's dead? For real?

228
00:12:55,512 --> 00:12:58,757
Hey. You're joking, aren't you?

229
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:01,712
Dear? Dear?

230
00:13:01,712 --> 00:13:03,912
Dear!

231
00:13:03,912 --> 00:13:06,765
His mouth smelled like almond.

232
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:08,767
Cyanide compound poisoning.

233
00:13:10,312 --> 00:13:12,112
He's been poisoned.

234
00:13:18,137 --> 00:13:21,437
The victim is Mr. Taruto Urai, age 53,

235
00:13:21,437 --> 00:13:23,237
the president of Urai Confections,

236
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:26,537
and the host of this party.

237
00:13:26,537 --> 00:13:29,237
I heard from the coroner that he was poisoned.

238
00:13:29,237 --> 00:13:31,537
Yes, sir. He died from acute drug poisoning

239
00:13:31,537 --> 00:13:33,937
by a cyanide compound.

240
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:37,337
So, when the president collapsed,

241
00:13:37,337 --> 00:13:40,799
Conan, Ran and you, his wife,

242
00:13:41,037 --> 00:13:43,337
who is the vice president of Urai Confections,

243
00:13:43,337 --> 00:13:46,805
were the only three near him?

244
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:49,337
Yes, that's right.

245
00:13:49,337 --> 00:13:51,637
I think it was just when Mr. Mouri went up to the podium

246
00:13:51,637 --> 00:13:54,037
to deliver his speech.

247
00:13:54,037 --> 00:13:55,237
Yes.

248
00:13:55,237 --> 00:13:58,817
My husband suddenly let out a loud groan and fell to the floor.

249
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:01,237
He hasn't moved since.

250
00:14:01,237 --> 00:14:02,237
If I remember correctly,

251
00:14:02,237 --> 00:14:06,837
the one who was right beside the president at that time was you.

252
00:14:06,837 --> 00:14:10,829
Yes. I was palm reading for Ran.

253
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:11,837
Palm reading?

254
00:14:11,837 --> 00:14:13,737
Is it true?

255
00:14:13,737 --> 00:14:14,833
Yes.

256
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,837
Mrs. Urai held my left hand with both her hands

257
00:14:17,837 --> 00:14:19,337
and read my palms.

258
00:14:20,637 --> 00:14:22,841
If both her hands were being used,

259
00:14:23,037 --> 00:14:27,237
she couldn't have made him drink the poison with her hands.

260
00:14:27,237 --> 00:14:32,037
Did Mrs. Urai call out to her husband back then?

261
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,853
Saying something like drink something or eat something.

262
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:36,855
No, not especially.

263
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:39,937
But while she was reading your palm,

264
00:14:39,937 --> 00:14:42,037
Mrs. Urai said at one point,

265
00:14:42,037 --> 00:14:45,537
"Is it working?".

266
00:14:45,537 --> 00:14:47,837
Working?

267
00:14:47,837 --> 00:14:51,137
At first I thought she was talking to me,

268
00:14:51,137 --> 00:14:54,037
but I later found out that she was talking to her husband.

269
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:56,437
It's because he looked dazed out

270
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,337
when Mr. Mouri was giving his speech.

271
00:14:59,337 --> 00:15:02,337
But, the president's answer back then

272
00:15:02,337 --> 00:15:04,883
was sort of strange.

273
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:06,137
Strange?

274
00:15:06,137 --> 00:15:09,537
He didn't answer "It's working" or "It's not working"

275
00:15:09,537 --> 00:15:13,237
but rather, "Yeah, I think so" was his answer.

276
00:15:13,237 --> 00:15:14,437
I see.

277
00:15:14,437 --> 00:15:15,937
It's true that the answer is a strange one,

278
00:15:15,937 --> 00:15:19,537
if the question was whether listening to my speech was working or not.

279
00:15:19,537 --> 00:15:21,837
He was probably dazed out and not really listening,

280
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,903
so he answered ambiguously.

281
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:27,537
My husband was scheduled to make

282
00:15:27,537 --> 00:15:30,537
a serious announcement after Mr. Mouri's speech.

283
00:15:30,537 --> 00:15:32,337
A serious speech?

284
00:15:32,337 --> 00:15:33,737
Yes.

285
00:15:33,737 --> 00:15:36,915
About divorcing me and splitting the company into two.

286
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,437
Is that true?

287
00:15:40,437 --> 00:15:41,637
Yes.

288
00:15:41,637 --> 00:15:44,637
Urai Confections have become large enough,

289
00:15:44,637 --> 00:15:46,137
and my husband and I have been having a lot of arguments

290
00:15:46,137 --> 00:15:49,237
because of differences in management policies.

291
00:15:49,237 --> 00:15:51,937
Actually, my husband had pleaded and cried

292
00:15:51,937 --> 00:15:54,437
asking me to think it over, though.

293
00:15:54,437 --> 00:15:56,437
"I don't mind splitting the company up

294
00:15:56,437 --> 00:15:58,437
but please don't divorce me.

295
00:15:58,437 --> 00:16:01,237
I can't live without you", he said.

296
00:16:01,237 --> 00:16:03,637
Which means, don't tell me...

297
00:16:03,637 --> 00:16:05,937
He committed suicide from grief

298
00:16:05,937 --> 00:16:07,937
could be another viewpoint.

299
00:16:07,937 --> 00:16:10,949
If so, it's a great disappointment.

300
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,437
I'm a professional when it comes to sour tastes

301
00:16:12,437 --> 00:16:14,137
while my husband is an expert on sweet-tasting things.

302
00:16:14,137 --> 00:16:17,737
Just when I thought he had convinced himself

303
00:16:17,737 --> 00:16:20,637
that we go our own way at what we excel in...

304
00:16:20,637 --> 00:16:23,637
Come to think of it, my friend once told me

305
00:16:23,637 --> 00:16:24,963
that the president as well as his wife

306
00:16:25,137 --> 00:16:27,737
have won the confectionery contest.

307
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:30,969
No, my husband has.

308
00:16:31,137 --> 00:16:32,971
I came in second place.

309
00:16:33,137 --> 00:16:36,237
I've never won the contest.

310
00:16:36,237 --> 00:16:37,937
But...

311
00:16:37,937 --> 00:16:38,977
Never mind that,

312
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:40,737
but if you're going to body search me,

313
00:16:40,737 --> 00:16:42,981
will you do so quickly?

314
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,985
If anyone were to give my husband poison,

315
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:50,737
there could be no likely one than me who was right beside him.

316
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:52,991
If so, I may still have the poison

317
00:16:53,237 --> 00:16:56,037
that would serve as evidence on me, right?

318
00:16:56,037 --> 00:16:57,937
Yes, well...

319
00:16:57,937 --> 00:17:02,137
I would appreciate it if you would body check me

320
00:17:02,137 --> 00:17:05,003
in the staff room beyond that door over there.

321
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:07,937
Because I'm sure that at the entrance of this hall there

322
00:17:07,937 --> 00:17:09,007
are a lot of people from the press

323
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:11,737
who have heard about this incident gathered around.

324
00:17:11,737 --> 00:17:15,013
If they see an officer taking me out from there,

325
00:17:15,237 --> 00:17:19,017
they may think that I'm being escorted to the station or something.

326
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:21,037
I see.

327
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:23,037
Officer Sato, take care of her for me.

328
00:17:23,037 --> 00:17:24,337
Yes, sir!

329
00:17:24,337 --> 00:17:25,637
Shall we?

330
00:17:25,637 --> 00:17:28,237
Excuse me, please let us through.

331
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:36,037
Are you all right?

332
00:17:38,037 --> 00:17:41,039
I shouldn't have worn such high heels like this.

333
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,637
Shall I lend you my shoulder?

334
00:17:43,637 --> 00:17:45,043
I'm fine.

335
00:17:45,237 --> 00:17:47,937
I just sprained my ankle.

336
00:17:47,937 --> 00:17:49,937
Let's get it over with, okay?

337
00:17:56,637 --> 00:17:58,337
Inspector Megure.

338
00:17:58,337 --> 00:18:01,337
I'll take it back with me and check it in detail,

339
00:18:01,337 --> 00:18:04,537
but there seem to be no traces of poison

340
00:18:04,537 --> 00:18:07,065
in the food or drinks here on the table.

341
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:08,437
I see.

342
00:18:08,437 --> 00:18:11,437
Well, I don't think he drank from the lemon tea

343
00:18:11,437 --> 00:18:14,037
that his wife was drinking.

344
00:18:14,037 --> 00:18:15,073
Yeah.

345
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:17,937
The president was known to hate sour things.

346
00:18:17,937 --> 00:18:19,937
I see.

347
00:18:22,437 --> 00:18:25,837
Are you hungry?

348
00:18:25,837 --> 00:18:30,437
Yeah, I haven't eaten anything after breakfast

349
00:18:30,437 --> 00:18:32,637
and I was summoned here

350
00:18:32,637 --> 00:18:34,537
just when I was about to have dinner, you see.

351
00:18:34,537 --> 00:18:39,097
But, doesn't your wife always make lunch for you, Inspector?

352
00:18:39,337 --> 00:18:41,737
Well, just before leaving the house,

353
00:18:41,737 --> 00:18:44,037
I had a fight with Midori, you see.

354
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:45,937
Like I just said,

355
00:18:45,937 --> 00:18:48,537
don't you have anything you need to give me today?

356
00:18:48,537 --> 00:18:50,837
So, I'm asking you, what is it?

357
00:18:51,837 --> 00:18:53,637
Well, it's so stupid,

358
00:18:53,637 --> 00:18:55,537
so don't ask me what it was.

359
00:19:00,637 --> 00:19:04,137
That's the gift that we passed out for this White Day party.

360
00:19:04,137 --> 00:19:07,137
Would you like me to give you one?

361
00:19:07,137 --> 00:19:08,537
No, thanks.

362
00:19:08,537 --> 00:19:11,137
White Day? What's that?

363
00:19:11,137 --> 00:19:13,837
It's judgment day when the extent

364
00:19:13,837 --> 00:19:15,133
of the love your boyfriend has for you

365
00:19:15,337 --> 00:19:17,135
will be exposed in broad daylight.

366
00:19:17,337 --> 00:19:20,437
First, you casually give him a Valentine's Day gift

367
00:19:20,437 --> 00:19:22,637
and exactly a month afterwards on March 14th

368
00:19:22,637 --> 00:19:23,937
if he gives you a gift in return,

369
00:19:23,937 --> 00:19:27,737
the bells of days of romance after romance will resound.

370
00:19:27,737 --> 00:19:29,147
But, if you get nothing, then the footsteps of broken love

371
00:19:29,337 --> 00:19:31,437
will close in.

372
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,151
Footsteps of broken love?

373
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:36,537
I'm sorry, I'm so thoughtless!

374
00:19:38,537 --> 00:19:42,537
Are you done with that heel?

375
00:19:42,537 --> 00:19:45,937
Yes. I'll check the other one then.

376
00:19:45,937 --> 00:19:49,167
No, no. I've got to concentrate on my job!

377
00:19:50,037 --> 00:19:51,437
What?

378
00:19:51,437 --> 00:19:53,171
A run-up murder?

379
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:56,637
Yes, exactly, Inspector!

380
00:19:56,637 --> 00:19:57,637
From what I hear,

381
00:19:57,637 --> 00:19:59,837
the president's been putting on performances

382
00:19:59,837 --> 00:20:02,937
to surprise the guests every year at the party.

383
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:09,187
Things like magic, masquerades or skits.

384
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:10,337
In other words,

385
00:20:10,337 --> 00:20:12,837
the first time the president shouted and collapsed,

386
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,837
it was a skit.

387
00:20:14,837 --> 00:20:18,137
It could be that he was counting on me

388
00:20:18,137 --> 00:20:20,937
to play the part as detective in his mystery story.

389
00:20:20,937 --> 00:20:24,937
But, of course he had no idea that he would be killed right after that.

390
00:20:24,937 --> 00:20:26,737
Then, who's the first person

391
00:20:26,737 --> 00:20:29,207
that ran up to him right after he collapsed?

392
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:31,209
Mrs. Urai.

393
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:34,637
She bent down close to the president and said,

394
00:20:34,637 --> 00:20:39,217
"Hey, what is it, dear? Is this supposed to be your mystery skit?"

395
00:20:39,437 --> 00:20:41,537
Don't tell me that she gave him the poison then!

396
00:20:41,537 --> 00:20:44,337
You mean she put it directly into his mouth?

397
00:20:44,337 --> 00:20:48,237
Yes. In other words, only his wife

398
00:20:48,237 --> 00:20:50,437
who knew of the contents of the skit could've done it.

399
00:20:50,437 --> 00:20:51,737
My, my.

400
00:20:51,737 --> 00:20:55,233
To think that a great detective like you would utter such nonsense...

401
00:20:56,537 --> 00:21:00,837
You were up on the podium and probably couldn't see,

402
00:21:00,837 --> 00:21:03,241
but my husband after collapsing

403
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:06,937
didn't even twitch nor utter a word.

404
00:21:06,937 --> 00:21:10,837
If I did administer the poison to him then,

405
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:15,253
wouldn't he has struggled and groaned in pain?

406
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:17,737
Hey, Ran! How was it?

407
00:21:17,737 --> 00:21:20,137
You were nearby then, weren't you?

408
00:21:20,137 --> 00:21:21,837
Just as she says,

409
00:21:21,837 --> 00:21:23,261
he didn't move at all

410
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:25,637
and looked to really be dead.

411
00:21:25,637 --> 00:21:27,837
In other words, your deduction right now

412
00:21:27,837 --> 00:21:29,837
is the goofed up version that you always talk about

413
00:21:29,837 --> 00:21:34,637
before really getting down to the nitty-gritty real stuff.

414
00:21:34,637 --> 00:21:37,037
Goofed up version?

415
00:21:37,037 --> 00:21:39,737
I remember this part well, but...

416
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,537
Hey, where did you blow the ash to?

417
00:21:48,537 --> 00:21:51,037
And how did the body check go?

418
00:21:51,037 --> 00:21:52,837
Yes, sir. No trace of poison

419
00:21:52,837 --> 00:21:56,237
nor of her having had possessed poison was detected.

420
00:21:56,237 --> 00:21:58,037
Most naturally.

421
00:21:58,037 --> 00:22:00,637
If so, this is...

422
00:22:00,637 --> 00:22:02,337
Inspector!

423
00:22:02,337 --> 00:22:04,637
A bottle of poison and a case of wafers

424
00:22:04,637 --> 00:22:08,683
were found in the glove compartment of the president's car.

425
00:22:08,683 --> 00:22:12,104
By wafers, you mean the thing that you wrap powdered medicine in

426
00:22:12,104 --> 00:22:13,604
that melts immediately in your mouth?

427
00:22:13,604 --> 00:22:16,404
Yes, sir. I reported that to the coroner

428
00:22:16,404 --> 00:22:18,404
and he told me that he found a melted wafer

429
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:20,904
on the molar of the president's mouth.

430
00:22:20,904 --> 00:22:25,104
I see. He hid the wafer with poison in his pocket,

431
00:22:25,104 --> 00:22:27,325
and drank it when he thought it was appropriate.

432
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:29,804
So, can we conclude that it's suicide?

433
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:37,004
I'm sure that Mrs. Urai is the culprit.

434
00:22:37,004 --> 00:22:39,337
However, how on earth did she do it?

435
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:03,440
Next Conan's Hint:

436
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,423
"Lemon".

437
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,174
Inspector, it'll become sour if you squeeze the lemon!

438
00:24:08,174 --> 00:24:09,156
You idiot!

439
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,780
You go on and squeeze some brains out of your head!
