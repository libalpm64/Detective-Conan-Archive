1
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:04,510
I was checking on the connection between Kir of the Black Organization,

2
00:00:04,516 --> 00:00:07,610
Rena Mizunashi and Eisuke Hondo,

3
00:00:07,616 --> 00:00:11,210
the new student who transferred from another school to Ran's class.

4
00:00:11,216 --> 00:00:13,210
I found out that Eisuke's father

5
00:00:13,216 --> 00:00:15,995
was hired at a place called "the Company".

6
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:18,310
And that Eisuke was looking for his older sister

7
00:00:18,316 --> 00:00:20,410
who had left home ten years ago,

8
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:23,710
that looked exactly like Rena Mizunashi.

9
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:27,010
Is Eisuke Hondo's older sister and Rena Mizunashi,

10
00:00:27,016 --> 00:00:30,009
one and the same person?

11
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:31,810
We went to visit Mr. Anno

12
00:00:31,816 --> 00:00:35,110
who happened to be a great fan of Rena Mizunashi.

13
00:00:35,116 --> 00:00:37,510
We came to see you, sir.

14
00:00:37,516 --> 00:00:40,910
We've got a favor to ask you.

15
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:46,010
We want you to take a look at the picture of this woman!

16
00:01:04,616 --> 00:01:06,310
Sizzling hot suspense.

17
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,910
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

18
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:11,110
Eisuke Hondo looks for his older sister with all his might.

19
00:01:11,116 --> 00:01:13,710
An unexpected truth is revealed through blood types.

20
00:01:13,716 --> 00:01:15,210
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:15,216 --> 00:01:16,810
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:16,816 --> 00:01:19,710
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

23
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:52,990
"Red and Black Clash: Kin"

24
00:02:52,993 --> 00:02:57,590
"Anno"

25
00:03:05,593 --> 00:03:06,890
No matter what angle I look at her from,

26
00:03:06,893 --> 00:03:09,490
she looks like none other than Rena when she was young.

27
00:03:09,493 --> 00:03:10,990
You think so too, don't you? Don't you?

28
00:03:10,993 --> 00:03:14,173
Then maybe she's your older sister after all, Eisuke.

29
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:16,790
Huh? Are you Rena's younger brother?

30
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:19,190
Come to think of it, you have her eyes!

31
00:03:19,193 --> 00:03:21,590
Could you get me her autograph?

32
00:03:21,593 --> 00:03:25,390
Oh, but I think that the announcer called Rena Mizunashi

33
00:03:25,393 --> 00:03:27,890
and sis are two different people.

34
00:03:27,893 --> 00:03:30,189
He's looking for his older sister who left home,

35
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:32,191
that's her in this picture, you see!

36
00:03:32,393 --> 00:03:34,690
I'm sure it's her, then!

37
00:03:34,693 --> 00:03:37,190
I'm a great fan of hers and I would never make a mistake!

38
00:03:37,193 --> 00:03:39,570
But...

39
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,490
Come to think of it, when Rena first came on TV,

40
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:46,205
she had a hair style very similar to that of this woman.

41
00:03:46,205 --> 00:03:48,890
Maybe watching a video of back then may help?

42
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:54,213
This is a recording of the news program that made her popular.

43
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:56,490
Well, take a look at it.

44
00:03:56,493 --> 00:03:58,217
This is an image taken from the air.

45
00:03:58,393 --> 00:04:00,219
The scene sure looks like a battlefield!

46
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:02,221
This chemical plant suddenly exploded.

47
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:03,290
Although it is still unconfirmed,

48
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:05,590
there seems to be a number of over 100 casualties.

49
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:07,490
The victims are being moved into

50
00:04:07,493 --> 00:04:09,190
a hospital nearby one after the other.

51
00:04:09,193 --> 00:04:11,370
This disastrous incident occurred while we, at Nichiuri TV

52
00:04:11,378 --> 00:04:12,890
were conducting an interview here.

53
00:04:12,893 --> 00:04:15,370
I was also slightly injured myself because of the explosion...

54
00:04:15,378 --> 00:04:16,990
Excuse me!

55
00:04:16,993 --> 00:04:18,237
Is there anyone here that is blood type AB,

56
00:04:18,393 --> 00:04:20,239
any AB blood type people around?

57
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,690
We don't have enough blood.

58
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:23,990
Is there anyone with blood type AB?

59
00:04:23,993 --> 00:04:26,890
I'm sorry, I have blood type AB, so I've got to go!

60
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:28,247
What, Rena?

61
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:31,790
Oh, I'm blood type AB!

62
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:35,490
My, you're hurt too.

63
00:04:35,493 --> 00:04:38,257
Yes, but I've got a lot of hot blood.

64
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:40,790
I see, please come inside with me.

65
00:04:40,793 --> 00:04:44,263
Did you see that? She's hurt herself, and yet she has the kindness

66
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:45,990
to offer her blood to someone else!

67
00:04:45,993 --> 00:04:47,990
That's not easy to do, right?

68
00:04:47,993 --> 00:04:50,690
No, it's not.

69
00:04:50,693 --> 00:04:54,273
The fact is, she was at this plant doing an interview,

70
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:56,990
and had a bad wound that required several stitches herself.

71
00:04:56,993 --> 00:04:59,390
That's why after she gave blood for blood transfusion,

72
00:04:59,393 --> 00:05:01,390
she went faint and had to receive transfusion herself.

73
00:05:01,393 --> 00:05:04,283
Cute try, don't you think?

74
00:05:07,793 --> 00:05:11,490
I'm completely recovered now.

75
00:05:11,493 --> 00:05:14,690
How about it, Eisuke? She's not your older sister?

76
00:05:14,693 --> 00:05:16,990
-No, she isn't! -Huh, why not?

77
00:05:16,993 --> 00:05:19,790
Go on, and take a closer look at her!

78
00:05:19,793 --> 00:05:21,790
It's not her, I'm telling you it's not her.

79
00:05:21,793 --> 00:05:24,303
If what his older sister said...

80
00:05:24,493 --> 00:05:28,990
Your blood type is one that you can give to everybody.

81
00:05:28,993 --> 00:05:30,309
If what she said is true,

82
00:05:30,493 --> 00:05:32,311
his blood type is the only blood type

83
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:34,313
that can be given to anyone.

84
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:35,790
Blood type, O.

85
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:39,190
Normally, blood of the same type is used for transfusions,

86
00:05:39,193 --> 00:05:41,090
but when there is a need for a large amount of blood transfusion

87
00:05:41,093 --> 00:05:44,790
or in a life or death situation and blood is needed right away,

88
00:05:44,793 --> 00:05:46,790
no matter what blood type the person is,

89
00:05:46,793 --> 00:05:49,390
blood type O is used.

90
00:05:49,393 --> 00:05:52,331
The situation in the video just now, was just that.

91
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:53,790
But, O blood type people

92
00:05:53,793 --> 00:05:56,690
can only receive from other O blood type people.

93
00:05:56,693 --> 00:05:59,290
If he received blood from his older sister in the past,

94
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:01,590
his sister should've also been blood type O.

95
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:03,090
However, the woman in the video

96
00:06:03,093 --> 00:06:04,790
declared that she was blood type AB.

97
00:06:04,793 --> 00:06:07,290
Moreover, she received blood transfusion herself later on too.

98
00:06:07,293 --> 00:06:09,890
If she were actually blood type O,

99
00:06:09,893 --> 00:06:13,390
and for some reason lied saying that she was blood type AB,

100
00:06:13,393 --> 00:06:15,690
she can give blood to a person who is blood type AB,

101
00:06:15,693 --> 00:06:17,490
but she cannot receive that blood type!

102
00:06:17,493 --> 00:06:18,890
In other words,

103
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:23,190
Rena Mizunashi and the woman in the picture are two different people.

104
00:06:23,193 --> 00:06:26,365
Then, the reason he's looking for Rena Mizunashi

105
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:29,090
is not because she's his older sister.

106
00:06:29,093 --> 00:06:32,371
But, rather, it's because she looks exactly like his older sister.

107
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:35,390
"Haido Central Hospital"

108
00:06:38,593 --> 00:06:39,990
A young man who has an older sister

109
00:06:39,993 --> 00:06:41,990
who looks just like Rena Mizunashi.

110
00:06:41,993 --> 00:06:45,090
Yep. It seems as if he found out that Rena Mizunashi

111
00:06:45,093 --> 00:06:47,690
was hurt badly in that incident in the past.

112
00:06:47,693 --> 00:06:50,990
Now he's going around to various hospitals looking for her.

113
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:54,690
So, he may just show up at that hospital.

114
00:06:54,693 --> 00:06:57,790
Okay! So you want me to work it out, right?

115
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:58,990
Don't worry!

116
00:06:58,993 --> 00:07:04,990
Only a few doctors and nurses are aware that she's here.

117
00:07:04,993 --> 00:07:06,890
But what a surprise that

118
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,190
Rena Mizunashi had a younger brother.

119
00:07:09,193 --> 00:07:12,190
No, Rena Mizunashi and Eisuke Hondo's older sister

120
00:07:12,193 --> 00:07:13,490
are two different people!

121
00:07:13,493 --> 00:07:15,690
They have different blood types.

122
00:07:15,693 --> 00:07:17,090
Huh, what do you mean?

123
00:07:17,093 --> 00:07:19,190
It's most likely that the guys in black

124
00:07:19,193 --> 00:07:21,790
made the real Rena Mizunashi undergo plastic surgery

125
00:07:21,793 --> 00:07:24,690
to make her look just like Eisuke's older sister

126
00:07:24,693 --> 00:07:27,490
because of something having to do with Eisuke's father.

127
00:07:27,493 --> 00:07:31,290
What? What's the identity of that boy's father?

128
00:07:31,293 --> 00:07:35,090
I don't know yet, but all I can say is that

129
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:37,890
he is most probably a member of "the Company".

130
00:07:37,893 --> 00:07:40,090
Company?

131
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,090
Don't tell me that...

132
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:42,890
I'm just saying most probably.

133
00:07:42,893 --> 00:07:45,090
It's not that he himself said so.

134
00:07:45,093 --> 00:07:46,190
Hey, you.

135
00:07:46,193 --> 00:07:48,090
Aren't you prying a bit too deeply? It can be dangerous.

136
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,290
Are you sure you're going to be okay?

137
00:07:49,293 --> 00:07:51,190
Yeah, at least for now.

138
00:07:51,193 --> 00:07:53,290
At least for now?

139
00:07:53,293 --> 00:07:56,455
Oh, I want to confirm something before I go.

140
00:07:56,455 --> 00:08:00,190
Do you know what blood type Rena Mizunashi is?

141
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:02,990
Blood type AB, RH+.

142
00:08:02,993 --> 00:08:04,890
Just as I thought.

143
00:08:04,893 --> 00:08:09,490
Okay, I'll try checking on his father, on our side too.

144
00:08:09,493 --> 00:08:12,471
But, promise me that you won't step into the dangerous zone!

145
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:15,690
Okay, thanks Jodie.

146
00:08:16,793 --> 00:08:18,477
And, how was it?

147
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:19,990
Were the older sister of the boy named Eisuke

148
00:08:19,993 --> 00:08:22,481
and Rena Mizunashi really two different people?

149
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:25,390
Yeah, Rena Mizunashi is blood type AB,

150
00:08:25,393 --> 00:08:27,590
and Eisuke Hondo is blood type O.

151
00:08:27,593 --> 00:08:29,290
If the story about Eisuke receiving a blood transfusion

152
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:30,250
from his older sister is true,

153
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:32,080
they're two different people.

154
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:33,080
Because blood type O people

155
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:35,690
can only receive blood from people with the same blood type!

156
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:37,080
But, he received the blood transfusion

157
00:08:37,087 --> 00:08:39,490
when he was a child, didn't he?

158
00:08:39,493 --> 00:08:43,090
It could be that he's mistaken.

159
00:08:43,093 --> 00:08:45,590
Yeah, it's possible.

160
00:08:45,593 --> 00:08:48,790
Including the fact of whether he really has blood type O.

161
00:08:48,793 --> 00:08:51,890
Why don't you go confirm it by asking him directly then?

162
00:08:51,893 --> 00:08:54,090
Or, hospitalizing him and checking it out?

163
00:08:54,093 --> 00:08:55,590
Oh, come of it!

164
00:08:55,593 --> 00:08:56,890
Either way, it's true that

165
00:08:56,893 --> 00:08:59,590
we've got to check up on that as soon as possible.

166
00:08:59,593 --> 00:09:02,890
We've got to find out why he's looking for Rena Mizunashi

167
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:05,190
and make him stop,

168
00:09:05,193 --> 00:09:08,190
before those guys in black take note of him!

169
00:09:08,193 --> 00:09:11,990
Right! Those guys were also looking for her.

170
00:09:11,993 --> 00:09:15,490
Yeah, and most probably really desperately too.

171
00:09:15,493 --> 00:09:19,090
Wouldn't it be a good idea to make them see each other then?

172
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:22,541
You know where she's hospitalized,

173
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:23,890
and besides that boy named Eisuke

174
00:09:23,893 --> 00:09:26,290
is not a member of their group, right?

175
00:09:26,293 --> 00:09:30,290
No, I can't risk letting them see each other yet.

176
00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:33,790
Because there's still a possibility that Eisuke Hondo

177
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:37,990
is being used by them without his being aware!

178
00:09:37,993 --> 00:09:40,990
"Haido Central Hospital"

179
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:16,595
"Aoyama General Hospital"

180
00:10:25,193 --> 00:10:28,090
You've finally awakened?

181
00:10:28,093 --> 00:10:29,890
You're...

182
00:10:29,893 --> 00:10:31,690
You don't remember?

183
00:10:31,693 --> 00:10:33,890
I'm the one who ran you down with my car.

184
00:10:33,893 --> 00:10:37,290
Oh, now that you mentioned it.

185
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,390
I'm sorry, just because of my carelessness.

186
00:10:46,393 --> 00:10:49,290
No, I was absent-minded too.

187
00:10:49,293 --> 00:10:52,631
Don't you have a headache? Does any part of your body hurt?

188
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:53,790
No, I'm fine.

189
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:56,635
I'm glad! I'll go get the doctor now!

190
00:10:56,793 --> 00:11:00,090
What's your name?

191
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:02,641
I'm Akemi Miyano.

192
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:08,390
I'm Dai Moroboshi. Nice to meet you.

193
00:11:08,393 --> 00:11:12,651
Oh, yes, same here!

194
00:11:39,678 --> 00:11:43,970
What? You know where Rena Mizunashi's condo is?

195
00:11:43,978 --> 00:11:44,970
Are you serious?

196
00:11:44,978 --> 00:11:48,687
Yep. She asked us to check on an incident for her in the past.

197
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:50,470
Right, dad?

198
00:11:50,478 --> 00:11:52,691
Yeah.

199
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:59,070
Doorbell prank?

200
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:02,370
And you want me to nab the one who's doing it?

201
00:12:02,378 --> 00:12:05,670
See, I told you that it'd be rude to ask him.

202
00:12:11,878 --> 00:12:14,970
I checked and found out...

203
00:12:14,978 --> 00:12:17,970
A kid!

204
00:12:17,978 --> 00:12:19,870
No good. If you're a boy, be strong

205
00:12:19,878 --> 00:12:22,470
and put your mother at ease.

206
00:12:22,478 --> 00:12:28,070
So, it turned out to be a prank played by a kid.

207
00:12:28,978 --> 00:12:30,729
I'm home!

208
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:32,070
Oh, hi, Conan.

209
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:35,370
Then, why didn't you take Eisuke along?

210
00:12:35,378 --> 00:12:36,735
He can make out if it's really his older sister or not

211
00:12:36,978 --> 00:12:38,737
if they meet, right?

212
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:41,770
Because I didn't think it was a very good idea to tell him

213
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:44,170
where a famous announcer lived without asking permission first.

214
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:46,470
And, I didn't want to build up his hope,

215
00:12:46,478 --> 00:12:49,670
then find out she was the wrong person and disappoint him even more.

216
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:51,570
I'm telling you it's not her!

217
00:12:51,578 --> 00:12:54,370
He watched that video of Rena Mizunashi

218
00:12:54,378 --> 00:12:57,070
but insisted that she wasn't his older sister too, right?

219
00:12:57,078 --> 00:12:58,757
I guess so.

220
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:01,670
It's good that he didn't go.

221
00:13:01,678 --> 00:13:03,970
Those guys in black are likely

222
00:13:03,978 --> 00:13:08,070
watching that condo now after Rena Mizunashi disappeared.

223
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,771
If Eisuke Hondo was taken to her place,

224
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:14,070
they would immediately lay their eyes on him,

225
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:16,775
and things would have taken a turn for the worse.

226
00:13:17,678 --> 00:13:20,779
So, Rena Mizunashi wasn't the older sister,

227
00:13:20,978 --> 00:13:23,770
who ran away from home of that klutzy boy?

228
00:13:23,778 --> 00:13:26,270
Nope, well, he said she wasn't.

229
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:29,870
Come to think of it, back then.

230
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:36,470
I used to have a younger brother about his age in the past.

231
00:13:36,478 --> 00:13:39,470
So, it wasn't the klutzy kid she was referring to then?

232
00:13:39,478 --> 00:13:40,799
I guess not.

233
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:43,870
Besides, I'm sure that his blood type was not the same as Rena,

234
00:13:43,878 --> 00:13:47,370
when I asked him about it some time ago.

235
00:13:47,378 --> 00:13:49,270
Come on, Ran, just because their siblings,

236
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:51,670
their blood types don't have to be the same, you know.

237
00:13:51,678 --> 00:13:54,470
But, in that video she said,

238
00:13:54,478 --> 00:13:56,815
"I'm blood type AB!"

239
00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:57,870
Blood type AB people

240
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,819
can only give blood to the same blood type people, right?

241
00:14:00,978 --> 00:14:01,970
Yep.

242
00:14:01,978 --> 00:14:03,570
If I remember correctly,

243
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:05,270
Eisuke mentioned that his older sister gave him blood for a transfusion

244
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,570
when he was a child and saved him.

245
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:10,829
I see, so if that klutz and Rena Mizunashi are really siblings,

246
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:13,670
they should both be blood type AB.

247
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:18,470
What blood type did Eisuke say he was?

248
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:21,270
If I remember correctly...

249
00:14:23,878 --> 00:14:25,370
Blood type O.

250
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:27,370
Hey, are you all right?

251
00:14:27,378 --> 00:14:31,670
Yes, I just tripped over something on the floor.

252
00:14:31,678 --> 00:14:34,853
Oh, I see. The tile is a slightly flipped over.

253
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:36,870
Oh, unlucky, as usual.

254
00:14:36,878 --> 00:14:40,859
No, I think you're possessed by something else.

255
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:43,370
When did Eisuke come?

256
00:14:43,378 --> 00:14:45,670
Together with us a while ago.

257
00:14:45,678 --> 00:14:47,670
He was using the restroom.

258
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,869
I'm the very first assistant of the Mouri Detective Agency, you see.

259
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:54,370
But, unfortunately, I have no work you can help me with.

260
00:14:54,378 --> 00:14:56,370
Is that so?

261
00:14:56,378 --> 00:15:00,070
By the way, what's all this interest in my blood type about?

262
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:01,970
We were wondering what blood type you are.

263
00:15:01,978 --> 00:15:05,370
You see, we're interested in what blood type you are.

264
00:15:05,378 --> 00:15:09,270
Come on, why don't you tell him straight that he's blood type O,

265
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:11,270
so he's not Rena Mizunashi's younger brother?

266
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,570
But, what if he's thinking somewhere in his heart

267
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:15,870
that she may be his older sister?

268
00:15:15,878 --> 00:15:16,895
I feel so sorry for him.

269
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:21,170
-Hey, are you really blood type O? -Yes.

270
00:15:21,178 --> 00:15:24,070
Have you donated blood recently?

271
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:26,170
Oh, no, I haven't.

272
00:15:26,178 --> 00:15:27,770
Then, have you been brought to the hospital

273
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:29,870
because of a bad injury or something?

274
00:15:29,878 --> 00:15:31,870
No, I haven't.

275
00:15:31,878 --> 00:15:34,170
I used to go to the hospital a lot when I was little

276
00:15:34,178 --> 00:15:36,270
because of wounds and illness.

277
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:39,570
I remember it was back when I just entered grade school.

278
00:15:39,578 --> 00:15:41,770
Bye bye.

279
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:45,970
I was run over by a car.

280
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,470
But, I haven't been hospitalized since.

281
00:15:47,478 --> 00:15:50,270
You mean when you received blood transfusion from your older sister?

282
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:53,470
Yes. Well, I do slip and fall,

283
00:15:53,478 --> 00:15:56,070
and get little cuts and bruises every day even now, though.

284
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:57,870
I'll bet.

285
00:15:57,878 --> 00:15:59,470
Oh, right.

286
00:15:59,478 --> 00:16:02,170
If you're that interested in knowing what blood type I am,

287
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:04,570
why don't you come with me tomorrow to where I'm going?

288
00:16:04,578 --> 00:16:06,570
I'm sure you'll get your answer.

289
00:16:06,578 --> 00:16:08,570
I was contacted by a person of the mansion

290
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:10,370
that my mother and I used to stay at before,

291
00:16:10,378 --> 00:16:12,670
telling me that my mother's belongings were found.

292
00:16:12,678 --> 00:16:14,070
So, I'm going to go pick them up.

293
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:16,955
Belongings? Your mother passed away?

294
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:18,957
Yes, from an illness.

295
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:22,961
It seems that my mother-child booklet is in there too.

296
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:24,070
What shall we do?

297
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:27,470
I don't think so, because I've got something to do tomorrow.

298
00:16:27,478 --> 00:16:31,970
Oh, but, it's the Okudaira residence in Haido-cho 3-chome,

299
00:16:31,978 --> 00:16:33,470
very near from here.

300
00:16:33,478 --> 00:16:35,870
Huh? If it's to the Okudaira residence in Haido-cho,

301
00:16:35,878 --> 00:16:38,370
I'm going there tomorrow too.

302
00:16:38,378 --> 00:16:39,570
Dad.

303
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:40,979
Is it for work?

304
00:16:41,178 --> 00:16:45,570
Yeah. Something about the oldest son of the family

305
00:16:45,578 --> 00:16:47,870
was killed in a queer way, a year ago.

306
00:16:47,878 --> 00:16:50,470
And they have no clue as to who the killer is.

307
00:16:50,478 --> 00:16:53,800
They contacted me, the famed, Kogoro Mouri

308
00:16:53,807 --> 00:16:56,995
to re-investigate the case.

309
00:16:56,995 --> 00:17:00,000
Oh, their son, you mean Tango?

310
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:02,000
Oh, I'm sure that was the name.

311
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:05,000
Oh, so you know him, Eisuke?

312
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:08,050
Rather, it was when I was a child,

313
00:17:08,058 --> 00:17:10,070
so the only thing I remember is his name.

314
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:11,770
But, how cruel.

315
00:17:11,778 --> 00:17:13,570
You just said you didn't have any cases.

316
00:17:13,578 --> 00:17:15,470
I meant, I don't have any cases

317
00:17:15,478 --> 00:17:17,470
that a klutz like you can help me with.

318
00:17:17,478 --> 00:17:20,370
Oh, come on.

319
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:28,770
Your mother was working here as a housekeeper?

320
00:17:28,778 --> 00:17:32,770
Yes, we lived here. She raised me while working here.

321
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:42,370
Back then, what were your father and older sister doing?

322
00:17:42,378 --> 00:17:45,043
I was told that my dad was working in Osaka

323
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:48,770
and that my sister was studying abroad as an exchange student.

324
00:17:48,778 --> 00:17:51,049
But, she used to come home, every vacation she had.

325
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:55,070
As for dad, the most I got to see of him was during New Years.

326
00:17:55,078 --> 00:17:57,670
"The morgue"

327
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,770
After my mother passed away,

328
00:18:00,778 --> 00:18:03,070
my father took custody of me,

329
00:18:03,078 --> 00:18:05,870
and I ended up living in Osaka with him for a while.

330
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:08,570
For a while? You mean you don't live with him now?

331
00:18:08,578 --> 00:18:12,670
No, it seems that father went abroad on a business trip.

332
00:18:12,678 --> 00:18:15,073
And since then, I was taken care of at an acquaintance's house.

333
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:17,470
What an irresponsible father.

334
00:18:17,478 --> 00:18:21,370
I wouldn't be surprised that your older sister left home.

335
00:18:26,078 --> 00:18:29,087
But, my father sends me money every month.

336
00:18:29,278 --> 00:18:32,170
"Eiko Okudaira (56)" -My Eisuke, long time no see.

337
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:34,470
Has it been about ten years since I last saw you?

338
00:18:34,478 --> 00:18:36,570
You've really grown!

339
00:18:36,578 --> 00:18:38,170
Yes, thanks to everyone.

340
00:18:38,178 --> 00:18:40,770
I've taken your mother's belongings out.

341
00:18:40,778 --> 00:18:43,570
Come on in, everyone.

342
00:18:43,578 --> 00:18:47,105
Oh, Kikuyo, will you please show them in?

343
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:49,370
Yes, ma'am.

344
00:18:49,778 --> 00:18:54,170
She's the housekeeper that came to work for us after your mother.

345
00:18:54,178 --> 00:18:55,670
"Kikuyo Tabata (39)" -She's not all that amiable,

346
00:18:55,678 --> 00:18:58,470
"Kikuyo Tabata (39)" -but she's a very kind person.

347
00:18:58,478 --> 00:18:59,970
Well...

348
00:18:59,978 --> 00:19:02,670
My, are you also here accompanying Eisuke?

349
00:19:02,678 --> 00:19:03,770
Oh, no,

350
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:08,470
I'm Kogoro Mouri and have come by request of your husband.

351
00:19:08,478 --> 00:19:11,129
My, you mean that famous detective.

352
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:13,570
I've heard about you from my husband.

353
00:19:13,578 --> 00:19:15,133
Yes!

354
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:19,570
I'll show Detective Mouri to my husband's study,

355
00:19:19,578 --> 00:19:22,770
so you go ahead and show Eisuke and the others to the living room.

356
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:25,143
Yes, ma'am.

357
00:19:34,278 --> 00:19:37,670
Oh, they sure look alike.

358
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:40,270
Eisuke really looks like his mother, doesn't he?

359
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:45,163
I guess so because he didn't look like his father.

360
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:47,165
Oh, here it is.

361
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:49,167
The mother-child booklet!

362
00:19:50,878 --> 00:19:53,171
It's written over here, see?

363
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:57,170
Eisuke Hondo, blood type O!

364
00:19:57,178 --> 00:19:59,177
True.

365
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:01,179
So, now everyone knows that I'm blood type O!

366
00:20:01,378 --> 00:20:02,670
I see.

367
00:20:02,678 --> 00:20:04,270
So, all that's left now is to verify the story

368
00:20:04,278 --> 00:20:07,185
about whether his older sister really gave him blood for transfusion.

369
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:10,770
I'm sorry, that the bag is slightly squashed.

370
00:20:10,778 --> 00:20:12,870
I wonder why that bag was where it was.

371
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,470
It was stuck way in back of the drawer in my dresser.

372
00:20:16,478 --> 00:20:18,770
But, I'm glad it was found.

373
00:20:18,778 --> 00:20:20,670
We showed it to Mrs. Okudaira

374
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,970
and found out it was the belongings of the housekeeper

375
00:20:22,978 --> 00:20:24,770
who worked here before,

376
00:20:24,778 --> 00:20:26,670
that's why we called you.

377
00:20:26,678 --> 00:20:31,570
Moreover, today is the first anniversary of Tango's death.

378
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:32,870
First anniversary of death?

379
00:20:32,878 --> 00:20:34,270
Mrs. Okudaira remarked that

380
00:20:34,278 --> 00:20:37,870
she thought that her son had summoned everyone here.

381
00:20:37,878 --> 00:20:39,217
Long time no see.

382
00:20:39,378 --> 00:20:40,670
Although it's been ten years since I last saw you,

383
00:20:40,678 --> 00:20:42,770
you haven't changed much, Mr. Segawa.

384
00:20:42,778 --> 00:20:45,223
No, the one who was working here when you were here

385
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:47,225
was my older brother.

386
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:52,970
He also passed away two years ago today of a traffic accident.

387
00:20:54,978 --> 00:20:57,235
Then this is the story.

388
00:20:57,478 --> 00:21:00,670
Mr. Okudaira, while you were showing the home video

389
00:21:00,678 --> 00:21:03,870
that you filmed to everyone except your son,

390
00:21:03,878 --> 00:21:05,870
who was drowned in the pool

391
00:21:05,878 --> 00:21:10,770
by someone who had snuck in from outside.

392
00:21:10,778 --> 00:21:14,870
Yeah, the police said that the estimated time of death of my son,

393
00:21:14,878 --> 00:21:16,770
was between 9:00 to 10:00 pm.

394
00:21:16,778 --> 00:21:19,570
We were all in the living room for 5 hours from 7:00 to 12:00

395
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:23,670
watching the video right through.

396
00:21:32,778 --> 00:21:38,170
And this is the print out of the video we were watching back then.

397
00:21:38,178 --> 00:21:41,070
Both his legs are tied and his mouth is covered with masking tape.

398
00:21:41,078 --> 00:21:43,281
Talk about terrible.

399
00:21:43,281 --> 00:21:45,970
But, why the video?

400
00:21:45,978 --> 00:21:47,770
Well, the housekeeper

401
00:21:47,778 --> 00:21:50,570
was screaming at the top of her lungs the following morning

402
00:21:50,578 --> 00:21:52,970
about my son being in the pool with all the water drained.

403
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,070
I thought that she was playing a joke on us,

404
00:21:55,078 --> 00:21:57,870
trying to surprise us.

405
00:21:57,878 --> 00:21:59,770
But, it was no joke

406
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:03,070
and it turned out that he was really dead.

407
00:22:03,078 --> 00:22:04,970
Do you have any idea of anyone

408
00:22:04,978 --> 00:22:07,305
who could've had a grudge against your son?

409
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:09,570
An idea of anyone,

410
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,270
not outside, but rather inside this house.

411
00:22:12,278 --> 00:22:14,470
Just what do you mean?

412
00:22:14,478 --> 00:22:18,070
This is what I think, Detective Mouri.

413
00:22:18,078 --> 00:22:21,319
My son was killed by someone sly and clever

414
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:24,470
who lives in this house.

415
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,700
Next Conan's Hint:

416
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,056
Valuable vase.

417
00:24:06,056 --> 00:24:07,425
Eisuke, don't go near it!

418
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,427
Don't worry, I'm just going to take a look.

419
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:11,220
He's been punished.
