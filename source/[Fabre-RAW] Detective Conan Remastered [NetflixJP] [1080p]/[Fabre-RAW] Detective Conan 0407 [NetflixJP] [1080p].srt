1
00:00:05,622 --> 00:00:07,222
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:07,222 --> 00:00:08,922
They can be the culprit or the actor.

3
00:00:08,922 --> 00:00:10,522
A killing occurs in a magician's house.

4
00:00:10,522 --> 00:00:11,822
Magic, gimmick or trick.

5
00:00:11,822 --> 00:00:13,922
Conan and Heiji solve it, both together!

6
00:00:13,922 --> 00:00:15,322
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:15,322 --> 00:00:17,122
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:17,122 --> 00:00:19,422
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:58,409
After going through

10
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,709
some incident at Dogo Hoshikawa's magic show,

11
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:05,709
we were invited to Mr. Masakage, a legendary magician's house.

12
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,909
Also, it happened to be the day

13
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:13,209
Mr. Masakage suddenly disappeared 10 years ago.

14
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:16,709
We were at Mr. Masakage's house with his pupils.

15
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:20,209
If we're really going to do a show together,

16
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:23,809
the highlight of my magic will be "Witch Reborn"!

17
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:25,209
What?

18
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:28,609
I'm gonna place a huge cross in the middle of the audience

19
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:31,809
and tie myself to it.

20
00:02:31,809 --> 00:02:34,509
I'll have the audience fire it up,

21
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:38,409
and before the cross burns out, I'll vanish.

22
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:42,309
Next time you see me is when I emerge out of the ashes.

23
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:48,609
Maybe the light bulb burned out.

24
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:51,709
Okay, I found it.

25
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:07,609
"Conan and Heiji's Deduction Magic (House)"

26
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:12,309
Oh god. What was that scream?

27
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,309
Was that the second floor?

28
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:17,209
What's wrong?

29
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:18,909
Tenko's in trouble!

30
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:21,609
She's bleeding from her head. She's not moving!

31
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:22,909
Are you serious?

32
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:28,209
Shoots. Her body's already cold.

33
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:29,509
Oh no.

34
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:32,209
Tenko!

35
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:33,609
Oh my god.

36
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:37,509
It looks like it's been more than 30 minutes since she died.

37
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:38,909
So, you two found her?

38
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:40,909
Well, Mr. Hoshikawa was with us too.

39
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:44,109
He just went into that room to call the police and ambulance.

40
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:48,609
Will you please hurry? Please!

41
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:50,809
Okay. Yeah.

42
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:54,109
Hey, Hattori, look.

43
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:56,909
The window is open.

44
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:04,109
If the murderer did jump off the window into the shrubbery,

45
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:07,509
he could easily run away from the rear gate.

46
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:09,209
Heiji, come over here!

47
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:10,909
What is it?

48
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:13,309
You gotta see what happened to the room next to the one

49
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:15,709
Tenko was found lying on the floor!

50
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:16,909
What?

51
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,809
What the heck is this?

52
00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:21,909
Tell me, what is this room?

53
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:26,609
Mr. Masakage traveled all around the world.

54
00:04:26,609 --> 00:04:28,709
Those are the documents on magic that he collected.

55
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:31,309
Is there anything that's really important in this room?

56
00:04:31,309 --> 00:04:33,609
No. It's mostly clippings from books and magazines

57
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:35,809
that you can find in any bookstore.

58
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:38,909
He used to show us those clippings.

59
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:44,609
If any, it would be the file which even I wasn't allowed to see.

60
00:04:44,609 --> 00:04:50,809
It is Mr. Masakage's notes on all the gimmicks about his original tricks.

61
00:04:50,809 --> 00:04:53,209
We call it "Masakage's notes".

62
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:56,809
Masakage's notes.

63
00:05:03,309 --> 00:05:05,709
Hey, look who's here.

64
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:06,809
When did you get here?

65
00:05:06,809 --> 00:05:08,609
Oh, just this morning!

66
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:11,809
I came here just to see a magic show today

67
00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:14,809
because this stupid girl said

68
00:05:14,809 --> 00:05:18,709
"I feel like watching some miracles" or whatever.

69
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:20,909
Don't call me stupid, stupid!

70
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:25,409
Actually, the fact that I always see you at crime scenes is a miracle.

71
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:27,709
All right. So why were you in this house?

72
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:29,909
We met three magicians at the magic show,

73
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:33,009
and they invited us to their master's house, which is here.

74
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:37,609
And then, one of them happened to be murdered by somebody.

75
00:05:37,609 --> 00:05:41,009
So the lady who was murdered was also a magician?

76
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:42,509
Her name is Tenko Himemiya.

77
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,109
She was pretty famous outside Japan.

78
00:05:46,109 --> 00:05:48,309
We were just planning to have a collaboration magic show

79
00:05:48,309 --> 00:05:50,609
all the three of us together.

80
00:05:50,609 --> 00:05:52,809
But I never thought it was gonna be like this.

81
00:05:52,809 --> 00:05:55,409
Okay. So who found her first?

82
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:58,209
Me, and those ladies over there.

83
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:03,509
Dinner was ready, so we went to call Tenko.

84
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:07,209
This is her master's room. We thought she might be here.

85
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:12,109
When we came up here, there was nothing in the hallway at first.

86
00:06:12,109 --> 00:06:16,109
But when I turned on the light since it was dark, the breaker went down,

87
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:19,709
and after the light turned back on,

88
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:22,409
Tenko was lying at the end of this hallway, just over there.

89
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:23,709
I see.

90
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:25,609
The fact that this hallway was dark

91
00:06:25,609 --> 00:06:27,409
was part of this homicide plan, I think.

92
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:30,209
The killer loosened the light bulb beforehand.

93
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:33,809
So if somebody comes to the hallway, turn on the light

94
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:36,009
and cause a blackout.

95
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:40,809
I found that some work was done on this switch to trigger a short circuit.

96
00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:42,709
Also, beside the dead body

97
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:45,809
is the reference room where the important file was stored.

98
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:48,609
And there is no window in that room which people can go in and out of.

99
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:52,209
One more thing, the window in Mr. Masakage's room was left open.

100
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:53,909
Considering all these,

101
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:57,709
it is likely that the person manipulated the switch

102
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,709
so he can safely steal Masakage's notes and run away.

103
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:02,409
To run away?

104
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:04,309
That's right. If the breaker has goes down,

105
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:07,709
somebody has to reset the breaker on the first floor, right?

106
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:12,709
While somebody is downstairs, the murderer jumps out of

107
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:16,809
the window of Mr. Masakage's room and runs away.

108
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:21,809
But it didn't go like the murderer planned.

109
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:25,609
In this house, there's usually only one woman living alone.

110
00:07:25,609 --> 00:07:28,009
But today, she had seven guests.

111
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:31,709
Not only that, Tenko came into the reference room

112
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:33,809
without turning on the light,

113
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:38,609
and saw the murderer, so he had to kill her.

114
00:07:38,609 --> 00:07:43,109
After that, the murderer went back to searching for Masakage's notes.

115
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:46,409
But now, other visitors came by, Kazuha and the others

116
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:48,009
came up to call Tenko.

117
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,809
Fortunately for him, the breaker had gone down.

118
00:07:49,809 --> 00:07:53,109
So he put Tenko's dead body in the hallway and ran away.

119
00:07:53,109 --> 00:07:55,809
There was a plenty of time to run away

120
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:59,509
because the people were struck with the dead victim.

121
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:02,609
-I see. -Well, if you think logically,

122
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:05,109
it seems that an outsider committed this crime.

123
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,309
Although he failed to steal the notes,

124
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:09,909
-there is one possible suspect among us. -Among us?

125
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:14,409
It's the person who caused the blackout. Mr. Hoshikawa!

126
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:15,509
What?

127
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:18,009
You were here during the blackout.

128
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:19,909
It wasn't that hard for you

129
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:23,109
to move Tenko from the reference room to the hallway,

130
00:08:23,109 --> 00:08:25,209
then go back to where the girls were

131
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:28,809
-before the lights turned back on, right? -That's impossible! I think.

132
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,709
-Right? -Yeah.

133
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:33,209
Because...

134
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:37,509
We were holding Mr. Hoshikawa while the power was out.

135
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,009
Holding him?

136
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:42,109
-Why? -Why?

137
00:08:42,109 --> 00:08:44,009
What do you mean why?

138
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:46,809
Because it was dark and scary.

139
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:50,209
Are you sure it was this guy?

140
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:51,809
Yes, I am!

141
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:58,309
I was holding Mr. Hoshikawa's arm like this.

142
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:01,309
And I was holding Kazuha like this.

143
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,409
See? Mr. Hoshikawa couldn't do it!

144
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:09,009
It's just like the case of Doctor Araide, isn't it, Conan?

145
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:11,209
-Yes. -Idiot.

146
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:13,409
I mean it was just a mere blackout, and you're not a kid anymore!

147
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:17,409
Well, Heiji. They're girls. They couldn't help it.

148
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:19,509
Huh? What's with you?

149
00:09:21,609 --> 00:09:25,109
By the way, where were you during the blackout?

150
00:09:25,109 --> 00:09:29,209
I was taking a nap in the room right below the bookroom.

151
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:34,909
I went into his room to wake him up. That was when the power went out.

152
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:38,309
Okay, then there's no way you guys murdered the victim.

153
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:41,909
So, it is likely that the murderer was an outsider?

154
00:09:41,909 --> 00:09:45,009
Anyway, could you tell us more about that important file?

155
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:48,309
It's my husband, Mr. Masakage's notes

156
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:51,309
and it is filled ideas on his original tricks.

157
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:53,409
Oh! I remember

158
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:56,509
I used to watch Mr. Masakage's show on TV when I was a kid!

159
00:09:56,509 --> 00:10:00,909
His magic included beautiful assistants and fantastic illusions!

160
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:03,609
I've have heard that too.

161
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:07,509
God, I still remember it!

162
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:11,409
Actually, I was his assistant.

163
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:15,509
Oh, I see. Where is he now?

164
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:19,109
Somebody told me he disappeared.

165
00:10:19,109 --> 00:10:20,709
Is that true?

166
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:23,709
Yes. It was today 10 years ago.

167
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:27,209
He used to go on outings suddenly without notice.

168
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,809
So I wasn't really worried at first.

169
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:32,009
Half a year past but he never came back.

170
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:36,409
Hoshikawa, Handa and Tenko are live-in students.

171
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:39,609
But they left and became independent.

172
00:10:39,609 --> 00:10:42,709
So this is actually our reunion for the first time in 10 years.

173
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:45,609
So you're the one who called everybody?

174
00:10:45,609 --> 00:10:47,909
Actually, it was me.

175
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:49,309
I told them to come here so that we could discuss

176
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:51,309
the collaborative magic show together.

177
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:54,709
Well, I used to come here on this day every year

178
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:57,709
and have dinner with Mrs. Masakage.

179
00:10:57,709 --> 00:10:58,709
All right.

180
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:04,409
Was there anybody who hated or held a grudge on Mr. Masakage?

181
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:09,909
According to Hattori's deduction,

182
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:13,509
it is likely that the murderer knew that Mrs. Masakage is living alone,

183
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:18,309
as well as being knowledgeable about the layout of the room and such.

184
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:23,109
Mr. Masakage's notes would've been worth quite a price, I would figure.

185
00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:25,809
Would somebody who would've been interested in getting a hold of it

186
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:27,109
ever have come by here?

187
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:29,809
But master is not the kind of person

188
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:32,109
anyone would want to hold a grudge against.

189
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:36,009
Actually, there was a man

190
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:39,809
who visited here many times, saying that he wanted to see my husband.

191
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:42,009
I just thought he was one of his fans, so I let him in.

192
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:44,209
But as soon as he went into my husband's room.

193
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:45,809
He started yelling,

194
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:50,609
"Come out, you thief! You stole my trick!"

195
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:53,809
Like this.

196
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:56,809
Handa, I told you about this story before, didn't I?

197
00:11:56,809 --> 00:11:59,109
Yes, I think you did.

198
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:01,409
What did the man look like?

199
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:04,709
Oh, it was 5 years ago. I don't really remember how he looked.

200
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:09,309
The layout of the house seems to have changed a bit after that incident.

201
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:11,409
Although it could just be my imagination.

202
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:13,309
The layout has changed?

203
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,609
Ran, what's wrong?

204
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:20,209
I just thought something's changed before and after Tenko was murdered

205
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:22,909
but I don't know what it is.

206
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,609
Oh, you think so too?

207
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:26,409
What? You too?

208
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:29,509
Yeah, but I don't know what it is either.

209
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:32,809
Maybe I should call Shinichi and ask him what it is.

210
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:34,109
Oh?

211
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:36,409
I thought his number was unlisted?

212
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:38,309
Yeah, but he finally gave it to me!

213
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:41,209
Shoots! I didn't turn it off! Where's it?

214
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:43,009
Okay, then call him and ask.

215
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:45,809
Kudo is a genius!

216
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:47,509
If you tell him about this case,

217
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:49,509
he'll probably say that he's gonna solve it with Heiji...

218
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:54,309
Sorry, I think I'm going to keep this cell phone

219
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:56,009
until we crack the case.

220
00:12:56,009 --> 00:13:00,209
-Hey! Heiji! Give it back to her! -Hey!

221
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:05,209
Okay. Now, let's hear the truth behind this murder.

222
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:08,409
Right, Mr. Genius?

223
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:11,609
What do you mean, "truth"?

224
00:13:11,609 --> 00:13:12,909
You liar!

225
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:16,009
You said it a while ago. Something that's bugging you.

226
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:17,609
Yeah. Just a little.

227
00:13:17,609 --> 00:13:22,709
First of all, why did the murderer choose today of all the other days?

228
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:27,909
Yeah. Today is the day Mr. Masakage disappeared 10 years ago.

229
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:31,009
If the murderer was familiar with the inside details of this house,

230
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:33,809
that person should've been aware that

231
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:35,509
Mrs. Masakage would not be alone today

232
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:37,909
because Mr. Handa had been visiting her every year.

233
00:13:37,909 --> 00:13:40,509
Secondly, why can't we find the splattered blood

234
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:42,009
of the victim, Tenko anywhere?

235
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:43,509
If my deduction is correct,

236
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:46,109
she must've been murdered in the hallway or the reference room,

237
00:13:46,109 --> 00:13:47,709
but there's no blood whatsoever in these places.

238
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:49,209
You're right.

239
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:53,409
Destruction of evidence seems too well-prepared

240
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:55,809
for a murder that happened accidentally.

241
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:58,109
Yeah. We should be able to find blood

242
00:13:58,109 --> 00:13:59,409
between the tiles on the floor

243
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:02,909
or in between the spaces of the wooden pillar.

244
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,009
And thirdly...

245
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,909
Oh, you mean there's some more?

246
00:14:05,909 --> 00:14:07,609
Kazuha.

247
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:11,409
I don't know what it is, but something's bugging me.

248
00:14:13,409 --> 00:14:17,309
You know, she's acting frivolous, lighthearted and all that.

249
00:14:17,309 --> 00:14:20,209
It just irritates me. I can't concentrate on my deduction.

250
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:21,809
Why is it?

251
00:14:35,253 --> 00:14:36,853
Why is it?

252
00:14:42,853 --> 00:14:46,453
Look, I don't think it's about her just being frivolous or lighthearted.

253
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:49,453
It's more than her just being frivolous and lighthearted

254
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:51,353
with another guy, don't you think?

255
00:14:51,353 --> 00:14:53,353
Oh yeah! You're right! That must be it!

256
00:14:53,353 --> 00:14:55,253
How did you know, Kudo?

257
00:14:55,253 --> 00:14:56,253
Huh?

258
00:14:56,253 --> 00:14:58,853
-What? -Kudo?

259
00:14:58,853 --> 00:15:01,253
Hattori! What's wrong with you?

260
00:15:03,553 --> 00:15:05,153
No...

261
00:15:05,153 --> 00:15:07,553
Dude, I mean! It's the dude.

262
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:09,453
That dude on TV said the temperature went up to 39 degrees yesterday.

263
00:15:09,453 --> 00:15:11,953
It was hot, wasn't it?

264
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:15,053
Oh yeah, I remember I saw something like that on TV

265
00:15:15,053 --> 00:15:16,953
at the airport this morning.

266
00:15:17,353 --> 00:15:20,653
All right. So, why am I feeling irritated? Don't you know?

267
00:15:22,653 --> 00:15:23,953
Kudo.

268
00:15:25,053 --> 00:15:27,853
Hattori. You know what?

269
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:32,553
Cause you are a kid.

270
00:15:32,553 --> 00:15:34,253
Gosh!

271
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:38,953
I'm not letting a brat call me a kid, you brat!

272
00:15:38,953 --> 00:15:40,753
Oh, Heiji!

273
00:15:40,753 --> 00:15:43,553
What're you getting all upset over a child for?

274
00:15:44,153 --> 00:15:46,253
Oh, poor Conan!

275
00:15:46,253 --> 00:15:48,253
What do you mean poor Conan?

276
00:15:48,253 --> 00:15:50,453
He's the one who started talking nonsense!

277
00:15:50,453 --> 00:15:53,353
Oh, come on, you're the one.

278
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:58,053
So, besides your husband's pupils, Mr. Hoshikawa and Mr. Handa

279
00:15:58,053 --> 00:16:02,553
were there any other magician friends of your husband who visited you?

280
00:16:02,553 --> 00:16:06,553
Well, 10 years ago, until my husband disappeared,

281
00:16:06,553 --> 00:16:09,153
many people had been visiting this house,

282
00:16:09,153 --> 00:16:10,953
so I can't really tell who was who.

283
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:14,053
Since my husband designed and built this house,

284
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:17,853
he would even invite the people he just met at work over too,

285
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:19,453
wanting to show this house off.

286
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:22,353
I see. So he designed and built this house.

287
00:16:22,353 --> 00:16:25,953
Yes. In fact, he showed them not only this house,

288
00:16:25,953 --> 00:16:28,753
but also the tricks that could be done only in this house.

289
00:16:28,753 --> 00:16:32,253
Therefore, even more people came here after hearing about it.

290
00:16:32,253 --> 00:16:36,053
The Christmas tree magic was a really popular one.

291
00:16:36,053 --> 00:16:38,853
Especially during the Christmas season, you know.

292
00:16:40,353 --> 00:16:42,853
Is anything wrong?

293
00:16:42,853 --> 00:16:44,653
No.

294
00:16:44,653 --> 00:16:49,253
Sorry. This has nothing to do with the case, I guess.

295
00:16:49,253 --> 00:16:52,253
Okay. So, could you tell us what kind of trick it was?

296
00:16:52,253 --> 00:16:54,253
Well...

297
00:16:54,253 --> 00:16:57,653
Only master can explain that trick.

298
00:16:57,653 --> 00:17:00,753
But since he's disappeared,

299
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:05,653
there's no way we can figure out how it works.

300
00:17:05,653 --> 00:17:09,353
The man that you mentioned visited you 5 years ago.

301
00:17:09,353 --> 00:17:12,153
Could you tell us more in detail about him?

302
00:17:12,153 --> 00:17:20,753
If he really said that your husband Mr. Masakage stole his trick,

303
00:17:20,753 --> 00:17:23,853
then it is probable that he really wanted to see the Masakage notes,

304
00:17:23,853 --> 00:17:27,753
because that's where he kept his ideas regarding the magic tricks.

305
00:17:27,753 --> 00:17:32,953
If we assume the murderer sneaked into this house to steal the notes,

306
00:17:32,953 --> 00:17:35,553
and silenced Tenko, since she saw that person

307
00:17:35,553 --> 00:17:38,753
searching for the notes in the reference room.

308
00:17:38,753 --> 00:17:40,253
It's plausible to think that

309
00:17:40,253 --> 00:17:43,153
the visitor from 5 years ago is the killer.

310
00:17:43,153 --> 00:17:45,453
His height or something characteristic about his face.

311
00:17:45,453 --> 00:17:48,353
Anything. Anything you can remember, Mrs. Masakage.

312
00:17:48,353 --> 00:17:51,653
Yeah, I'm trying but I can't.

313
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,153
Do you remember whether he was Japanese or not, right?

314
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:55,553
Oh yeah.

315
00:17:55,553 --> 00:17:59,953
He was speaking fluent Japanese, and his hair was black.

316
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:04,653
I don't know what kind of hair style he had since he was wearing a hat.

317
00:18:04,653 --> 00:18:09,753
Also, he had sunglasses on and his face was covered with a beard.

318
00:18:09,753 --> 00:18:14,353
So I couldn't really tell how he looked. I really can't.

319
00:18:15,753 --> 00:18:19,253
He seemed to be taller than me though.

320
00:18:19,253 --> 00:18:23,253
A face with a beard, wearing a hat, and sunglasses, huh?

321
00:18:23,253 --> 00:18:26,353
Maybe he was disguising himself.

322
00:18:26,353 --> 00:18:28,153
Probably.

323
00:18:28,153 --> 00:18:30,653
Anyway, have you checked whether Masakage's note

324
00:18:30,653 --> 00:18:32,153
have actually been stolen or not?

325
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:34,553
No. But, I heard that he kept it put away somewhere

326
00:18:34,553 --> 00:18:36,153
in the reference room,

327
00:18:36,153 --> 00:18:37,853
I never knew exactly where it was though.

328
00:18:37,853 --> 00:18:40,353
Maybe it wasn't there from the beginning

329
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:41,853
because master took it with him when he disappeared.

330
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:45,353
Okay, then, we should take a look at the photo albums!

331
00:18:45,353 --> 00:18:46,653
Photo albums?

332
00:18:46,653 --> 00:18:48,353
There should be pictures

333
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:51,653
since there were so many visitors in this house, right?

334
00:18:51,653 --> 00:18:53,853
Maybe we can find the man in those pictures!

335
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:56,253
Or at least someone that looks like him.

336
00:18:56,253 --> 00:18:57,753
I see.

337
00:18:57,753 --> 00:18:59,853
Mrs. Masakage, where do you keep your photo albums?

338
00:18:59,853 --> 00:19:01,653
In my husband's room.

339
00:19:03,753 --> 00:19:05,753
What is this, Mrs. Masakage?

340
00:19:05,753 --> 00:19:08,753
This door cannot be opened completely.

341
00:19:08,753 --> 00:19:12,853
Oh, that. My husband wanted to make his room big,

342
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:15,453
so he narrowed the hallway.

343
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:17,253
He must hate a small rooms.

344
00:19:17,253 --> 00:19:20,753
He was a great magician, but certainly not a great architect.

345
00:19:20,753 --> 00:19:22,153
I see that.

346
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,753
Kudo.

347
00:19:24,753 --> 00:19:25,953
Yeah.

348
00:19:26,553 --> 00:19:28,353
What are you guys doing there?

349
00:19:28,353 --> 00:19:29,353
Oh.

350
00:19:29,353 --> 00:19:31,353
You're not coming in?

351
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,153
How is it, Mrs. Masakage?

352
00:19:41,153 --> 00:19:44,353
Did you find anybody that looks like the man you met 5 years ago?

353
00:19:44,353 --> 00:19:46,153
No. Not yet.

354
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:49,453
You sure have a lot of pictures, Mrs. Masakage.

355
00:19:49,453 --> 00:19:52,153
Hey, Heiji. I think it's impossible to find the picture of the man

356
00:19:52,153 --> 00:19:53,753
from among these pictures, don't you?

357
00:19:53,753 --> 00:19:57,353
We aren't looking for the man. We are looking...

358
00:19:57,353 --> 00:19:58,853
I found it!

359
00:20:00,753 --> 00:20:03,853
So, this is the Christmas tree magic, huh?

360
00:20:03,853 --> 00:20:06,753
Look, the tree is standing at the end of the hallway.

361
00:20:06,753 --> 00:20:09,353
That's actually where Tenko was lying on the floor, right?

362
00:20:09,353 --> 00:20:11,253
There must be something behind it.

363
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:15,253
Hey! Look at this, Kudo.

364
00:20:15,253 --> 00:20:17,753
A picture of the three young pupils.

365
00:20:17,753 --> 00:20:19,853
Maybe this is...

366
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:24,653
She must be hiding something.

367
00:20:24,653 --> 00:20:27,453
What? What is it? What's going on?

368
00:20:28,153 --> 00:20:31,553
It's that. There.

369
00:20:31,553 --> 00:20:33,953
The thing on the ceiling.

370
00:20:33,953 --> 00:20:36,953
Isn't that a screen for a projector?

371
00:20:36,953 --> 00:20:38,853
What about it?

372
00:20:38,853 --> 00:20:42,653
People usually put that kind of screen on the wall, right?

373
00:20:42,653 --> 00:20:44,453
Cause they don't wanna watch it too close?

374
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,753
It's better to watch it that way.

375
00:20:46,753 --> 00:20:49,153
But it's not like that here.

376
00:20:49,153 --> 00:20:51,553
See? It's so far from the wall.

377
00:20:51,553 --> 00:20:53,553
Don't you think it's strange?

378
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,253
You're right. It is strange.

379
00:20:57,253 --> 00:21:00,353
It's no ordinary screen, actually.

380
00:21:00,353 --> 00:21:04,553
It is cut so that people can go through it.

381
00:21:04,553 --> 00:21:06,753
You guys have probably seen it.

382
00:21:06,753 --> 00:21:09,553
You know the trick, when a real person comes out of the screen

383
00:21:09,553 --> 00:21:11,553
that you're watching!

384
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:14,453
Oh, yeah I know. I've seen it before!

385
00:21:14,453 --> 00:21:16,253
We used that screen for practice.

386
00:21:16,253 --> 00:21:18,653
That's why it's not on the wall.

387
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,553
It was such a long time ago.

388
00:21:20,553 --> 00:21:24,353
You used to come here and practice together.

389
00:21:24,353 --> 00:21:29,953
But now, you're on your own. This room is no longer in use.

390
00:21:29,953 --> 00:21:33,153
Without master and this room,

391
00:21:33,153 --> 00:21:35,753
we couldn't have become successful like we are right now, seriously.

392
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:38,353
Every magic has a gimmick, there is no exception.

393
00:21:38,353 --> 00:21:40,553
And that's why we practice.

394
00:21:40,553 --> 00:21:47,153
We practice a lot until nobody can recognize how the trick works.

395
00:21:47,153 --> 00:21:52,053
Who would think that there's a cut on that screen?

396
00:21:52,053 --> 00:21:54,453
It never crossed my mind.

397
00:21:54,453 --> 00:21:58,453
They used to come to this room everyday back then.

398
00:21:58,453 --> 00:22:01,253
They used to check on when they should come out of the screen

399
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,553
and tried to avoid unnecessary shadow on the screen.

400
00:22:03,553 --> 00:22:04,753
Shadow!

401
00:22:04,753 --> 00:22:06,753
Yes, the shadow!

402
00:22:06,753 --> 00:22:10,253
Oh yeah. It was the shadow of the vase. It looked different!

403
00:22:10,253 --> 00:22:12,153
The shadow of the vase?

404
00:22:12,153 --> 00:22:14,753
The moonlight was shining on the vase from behind,

405
00:22:14,753 --> 00:22:17,353
so we couldn't see the patterns on it.

406
00:22:18,553 --> 00:22:21,853
But after the blackout, when we found Tenko's dead body,

407
00:22:21,853 --> 00:22:24,153
the moonlight was shining on the vase from the side,

408
00:22:24,153 --> 00:22:26,453
so we could see the patterns!

409
00:22:26,453 --> 00:22:28,053
It doesn't make sense!

410
00:22:28,053 --> 00:22:30,553
There's no way the moon moves that fast!

411
00:22:30,553 --> 00:22:32,453
The shadow of the vase.

412
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,180
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,980
"Shadow"

414
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,380
Next week, we'll squash the case.

415
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,084
You don't want to squash the case, we need to crack it!
