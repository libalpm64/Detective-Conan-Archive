1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,680
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,980
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,780
And start the countdown to deduction and love.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,580
The words "red", "white", and "yellow" written in the diary.

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,780
They are important hints to solving the case.

6
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,180
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,880
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,180
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:58,097 --> 00:02:01,301
"Red, White, Yellow, and Youth Detective Squad"

10
00:02:06,101 --> 00:02:07,601
-Goodbye. -Goodbye.

11
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:10,401
"Submit your problems here!"

12
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:12,101
"Youth Detective Squad, 1st Grade Class B"

13
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:16,401
There's nothing inside.

14
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:18,701
We received no requests for jobs today, too.

15
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:20,119
It's boring.

16
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:23,901
Well, it just goes to show that it's peaceful, right?

17
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:25,301
Right, right.

18
00:02:29,601 --> 00:02:31,701
Who could it be? At this hour of the day...

19
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:33,001
What a bummer.

20
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:34,901
This is weird.

21
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:35,901
Hello.

22
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:38,482
Hi, cool kid.

23
00:02:38,482 --> 00:02:40,889
Did you just finish your class?

24
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:43,589
Jodie?

25
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:45,089
What's up?

26
00:02:45,089 --> 00:02:48,147
I tried calling your number several times but couldn't get through.

27
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:50,149
After the "Shiranpuri" case,

28
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:53,189
my phone went dead, so I bought a new one.

29
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:54,153
A lot of things happened,

30
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:56,789
so I got myself a new number to start anew.

31
00:02:56,789 --> 00:03:00,159
Of course, I also managed to give my new number

32
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,589
to her who snuck into the Organization.

33
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:05,398
"Her"? You mean Rena Mizunashi?

34
00:03:05,398 --> 00:03:09,102
Yes. She gave me a call shortly after that.

35
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:11,202
She must've somehow called me in a hurry,

36
00:03:11,202 --> 00:03:13,802
so it was a very short one,

37
00:03:13,802 --> 00:03:16,175
but she clearly said...

38
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:19,402
A new member of the Organization has started making his move.

39
00:03:19,402 --> 00:03:21,902
He's a hunter who is immensely skilled in gathering information,

40
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:25,002
has fantastic observation ability and keen foresight.

41
00:03:25,002 --> 00:03:27,502
His code name is Bourbon.

42
00:03:27,502 --> 00:03:28,602
Beware of him.

43
00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:32,502
It was short call containing only that information.

44
00:03:34,602 --> 00:03:37,102
Judging from her harsh tone of voice,

45
00:03:37,102 --> 00:03:39,802
that hunter is probably outstandingly brilliant.

46
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,702
And his target is most probably

47
00:03:42,702 --> 00:03:47,302
the brown-haired girl that was called Sherry by the organization.

48
00:03:47,302 --> 00:03:48,602
Let us wait and see.

49
00:03:48,602 --> 00:03:51,502
-I guess so. -There's no one in the classroom.

50
00:03:51,502 --> 00:03:55,802
As for the FBI, we wish we could guard her tightly.

51
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,102
But if we do so right now,

52
00:03:57,102 --> 00:04:00,902
we'll be exposing her whereabout to those people.

53
00:04:00,902 --> 00:04:02,602
So, we're going to avoid seeing her for a while

54
00:04:02,602 --> 00:04:05,402
and leave things up to you to handle.

55
00:04:05,402 --> 00:04:06,702
Keep on your guard

56
00:04:06,702 --> 00:04:08,502
and protect her the best you can.

57
00:04:08,502 --> 00:04:09,802
Okay.

58
00:04:09,802 --> 00:04:13,402
All right. If something comes up, contact me through this number.

59
00:04:18,802 --> 00:04:21,202
Code name...

60
00:04:21,202 --> 00:04:22,241
Bourbon.

61
00:04:23,502 --> 00:04:26,245
By the way, what are we going to do after this?

62
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:28,247
The rain is pouring heavily.

63
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:31,702
Then, let's go to Doc's house and play games.

64
00:04:31,702 --> 00:04:33,102
Okay. Let's go!

65
00:04:33,102 --> 00:04:37,502
So? What do you plan to discuss with Doc,

66
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:39,302
renowned detective?

67
00:04:39,302 --> 00:04:44,263
That phone call just now was from Jodie of the FBI, right?

68
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:45,502
Well...

69
00:04:46,902 --> 00:04:48,267
Everything will be fine.

70
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:50,902
You've got nothing to worry about.

71
00:04:50,902 --> 00:04:52,271
"You"?

72
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:54,273
You're hiding something from me again, aren't you?

73
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,902
I mean, it's not like anything has happened yet.

74
00:04:56,902 --> 00:04:58,702
We have a case.

75
00:04:58,702 --> 00:05:01,902
Are Conan and Ai the case?

76
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:04,302
No, behind you.

77
00:05:13,202 --> 00:05:15,402
I see.

78
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:17,302
So, let me organise

79
00:05:17,302 --> 00:05:20,299
the story told by you, Kaito Sugiura from 1st Grade Class A.

80
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:23,802
Your father is the landlord of a small apartment,

81
00:05:23,802 --> 00:05:26,305
and there are three residents living there.

82
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:30,702
One of the three residents is making suspicious moves every night,

83
00:05:30,702 --> 00:05:33,602
so you want the members of Youth Detective Squad

84
00:05:33,602 --> 00:05:35,602
to find out what he's doing, right?

85
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,202
Yes.

86
00:05:37,202 --> 00:05:39,902
Okay. Why don't we all spend the night at his house tonight

87
00:05:39,902 --> 00:05:42,702
and stake out the resident?

88
00:05:42,702 --> 00:05:43,802
That sounds good!

89
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,325
Tomorrow is a Saturday, so there's no school either.

90
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:48,327
You're right.

91
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:50,702
Not today!

92
00:05:50,702 --> 00:05:55,302
I'll be playing Othello with my dad tonight.

93
00:05:55,302 --> 00:05:58,702
Is that why you tried to put the request letter

94
00:05:58,702 --> 00:06:02,341
into our shoes cabinet after we left school?

95
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:05,302
Because you didn't want to pass up playing Othello with your father tonight.

96
00:06:05,302 --> 00:06:06,345
Yes.

97
00:06:06,502 --> 00:06:11,702
But then, we would've only seen your letter on next Monday.

98
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:12,802
I see.

99
00:06:12,802 --> 00:06:16,802
So, what kind of suspicious thing does that person do at night?

100
00:06:16,802 --> 00:06:19,302
I think it'd be better if you come and spend the night tomorrow

101
00:06:19,302 --> 00:06:23,802
and see for yourselves, Kuroshi...

102
00:06:23,802 --> 00:06:25,802
I mean Edogawa.

103
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,802
Okay.

104
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:29,502
Oh, right. You can come in the afternoon if you like.

105
00:06:29,502 --> 00:06:32,371
I'd like you to see my room and visit the apartment too.

106
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:35,002
Okay then. How about we go together tomorrow afternoon?

107
00:06:35,002 --> 00:06:36,002
Sure.

108
00:06:36,002 --> 00:06:39,202
The address is 2-23, Beika-cho,

109
00:06:39,202 --> 00:06:41,502
and the name of the apartment is called Mokubaso.

110
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:44,902
See you again tomorrow, Kuroshi...

111
00:06:44,902 --> 00:06:46,402
Edogawa.

112
00:06:46,402 --> 00:06:48,102
Bye!

113
00:06:48,102 --> 00:06:50,389
Okay.

114
00:06:50,602 --> 00:06:53,102
Why did he only call out to Conan?

115
00:06:53,102 --> 00:06:55,502
Besides, why did he keep saying "kuroshi"?

116
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:58,902
Maybe he was trying to say "yoroshiku".

117
00:07:00,602 --> 00:07:05,002
2-23, Beika-cho, Mokubaso...

118
00:07:05,002 --> 00:07:07,502
Do you know that apartment?

119
00:07:07,502 --> 00:07:11,502
No. I think it is near Doc's house.

120
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:12,702
Yes.

121
00:07:12,702 --> 00:07:16,415
I always pass by that apartment on my way home from school.

122
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:20,419
It's a small and old apartment, but it seems pretty nice.

123
00:07:37,002 --> 00:07:38,702
Beika-cho...

124
00:07:39,902 --> 00:07:41,502
Block number 2...

125
00:07:45,702 --> 00:07:47,902
The street number is 23.

126
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,451
Mokubaso...

127
00:07:55,202 --> 00:07:57,602
It's right here, isn't it?

128
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,302
No... no way.

129
00:07:59,302 --> 00:08:01,502
It's completely burned down by fire!

130
00:08:01,502 --> 00:08:02,902
Oh, no.

131
00:08:02,902 --> 00:08:06,465
Come to think of it, I heard sirens in the middle of the night.

132
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:08,467
Then, what about the boy?

133
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:12,802
What happened to Kaito?

134
00:08:12,802 --> 00:08:15,402
Could he be trapped in the fire and...

135
00:08:15,402 --> 00:08:16,475
No way.

136
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:20,202
No. The boy named Kaito is fine.

137
00:08:20,202 --> 00:08:22,481
He suffered slight burns

138
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:24,502
"Inspector Yuminaga" -but was rescued by the firefighters,

139
00:08:24,502 --> 00:08:26,485
and is asleep at the hospital now.

140
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:28,487
Really?

141
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:30,489
What a relief!

142
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:32,802
Inspector Yuminaga.

143
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:34,493
Aren't you the kid staying at Mouri's place?

144
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:37,202
I haven't seen you since the Akauma arson case.

145
00:08:37,202 --> 00:08:38,502
Right.

146
00:08:38,502 --> 00:08:42,002
Inspector Yuminaga is the one who was in charge

147
00:08:42,002 --> 00:08:44,503
of the arson case in the past that we encountered

148
00:08:44,702 --> 00:08:46,505
when Heiji Hattori was here in Tokyo.

149
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:52,002
So, did anybody die in this fire?

150
00:08:52,002 --> 00:08:54,302
Fortunately, there are no casualties.

151
00:08:54,302 --> 00:08:57,202
But the father of the boy named Kaito, who is the landlord here

152
00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:59,702
is in the Intensive Care Unit right now.

153
00:08:59,702 --> 00:09:02,802
So during the fire, the other members of the boy's family

154
00:09:02,802 --> 00:09:06,525
and the residents of the apartment got away safely?

155
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:09,602
His mother happened to be on a trip.

156
00:09:09,602 --> 00:09:12,202
I called the hotel where she stayed at a while ago.

157
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:15,402
She was really shocked and said she'd be right back.

158
00:09:15,402 --> 00:09:17,802
There are three other residents,

159
00:09:17,802 --> 00:09:21,502
but all three of them happened to be away when the fire occurred

160
00:09:21,502 --> 00:09:23,902
and came back in the morning.

161
00:09:23,902 --> 00:09:25,202
They went out?

162
00:09:25,202 --> 00:09:27,002
But the fire occurred at night, didn't it?

163
00:09:27,002 --> 00:09:30,549
Yes, at around 2.30 in the morning.

164
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:32,551
Well, all three of them are adults,

165
00:09:32,802 --> 00:09:35,102
so there's nothing strange about them going out late at night

166
00:09:35,102 --> 00:09:36,555
and coming home in the morning.

167
00:09:36,802 --> 00:09:40,559
I bet the one who set the fire is one of the three people!

168
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,702
What?

169
00:09:41,702 --> 00:09:44,102
Kaito told us yesterday that one of the three residents

170
00:09:44,102 --> 00:09:47,482
is doing something suspicious at night!

171
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:51,485
We came to confirm that and ended up seeing this!

172
00:09:51,985 --> 00:09:53,585
I see.

173
00:09:53,585 --> 00:09:55,385
Inspector Yuminaga.

174
00:09:55,385 --> 00:09:58,577
This was found among the burnt remains.

175
00:09:58,577 --> 00:09:59,985
What is this?

176
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:05,585
This is... It's Kaito's diary.

177
00:10:07,685 --> 00:10:11,585
The last page is dated July 4th.

178
00:10:11,585 --> 00:10:13,185
That was yesterday.

179
00:10:13,185 --> 00:10:15,485
"The weather was bad this morning.

180
00:10:15,485 --> 00:10:18,185
I had to hurry and go to school

181
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:21,485
while the Red Person could sleep in."

182
00:10:21,485 --> 00:10:24,603
What does he mean by "the Red Person"?

183
00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:29,985
"I fell at the front door after coming home from school,

184
00:10:29,985 --> 00:10:33,885
but I was glad the White Person was going out.

185
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:37,285
The Red Person, the White Person and the Yellow Person

186
00:10:37,285 --> 00:10:38,617
are all out tonight.

187
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:40,185
It's just daddy and me tonight.

188
00:10:40,185 --> 00:10:42,621
I wish I could play for longer,

189
00:10:42,785 --> 00:10:45,185
but the members of the Detective Squad will be coming tomorrow,

190
00:10:45,185 --> 00:10:47,285
so I guess I'll go to bed early.

191
00:10:47,285 --> 00:10:48,385
I wonder who it is?

192
00:10:48,385 --> 00:10:51,385
Somebody came home in the middle of the night

193
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:54,185
and is arguing with daddy.

194
00:10:54,185 --> 00:10:55,785
It's the Yellow Person.

195
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:57,185
I wonder if daddy found out

196
00:10:57,185 --> 00:10:59,785
about the suspicious things he was doing?

197
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:02,385
I'm scared. Let's just cover my ears and sleep.

198
00:11:02,385 --> 00:11:05,685
I've got to tell Conan about this after I get up."

199
00:11:05,685 --> 00:11:09,585
So the one who set the fire is the yellow guy.

200
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,185
Inspector Yuminaga.

201
00:11:11,185 --> 00:11:13,985
What are the three residents like?

202
00:11:15,185 --> 00:11:19,085
Hey, can you bring the three of them here?

203
00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:20,285
Yes, sir.

204
00:11:38,385 --> 00:11:40,085
This feeling...

205
00:11:41,385 --> 00:11:43,785
Eyes that glare a prey down.

206
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:47,685
This pressure is almost as if my guts are being hollowed out.

207
00:11:48,985 --> 00:11:50,385
What's the matter?

208
00:11:52,185 --> 00:11:53,485
They're here.

209
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:55,785
They're nearby.

210
00:11:55,785 --> 00:11:57,985
The members of the organization!

211
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:14,713
They're here.

212
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:16,701
There's no doubt about it.

213
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:19,801
Why would members of the organization come here?

214
00:12:19,801 --> 00:12:21,601
What could possibly bring them here?

215
00:12:22,401 --> 00:12:25,401
No, I've got no time to waste on thinking about it.

216
00:12:25,401 --> 00:12:27,001
I've got to run.

217
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:29,401
I've got to hurry and get out of here,

218
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:30,729
or everyone else would...

219
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:36,201
It disappeared.

220
00:12:36,201 --> 00:12:39,501
-Hey, are you okay? -Yes...

221
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:41,001
Are you feeling sick?

222
00:12:41,001 --> 00:12:43,001
Are you all right?

223
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:44,743
Please cooperate a while longer

224
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:46,745
and answer the questions the officer asks you.

225
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:48,501
Please come this way.

226
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:55,801
So, who's the suspicious one among the three?

227
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:57,301
How would we know?

228
00:12:57,301 --> 00:13:00,301
That's what we came to find out from Kaito.

229
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:03,701
Why didn't you say so from the beginning?

230
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:07,701
What do those three people do?

231
00:13:07,701 --> 00:13:09,401
Starting from the right...

232
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:11,201
"Ryuhei Hosoi (25)" -the man with the band aid

233
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:13,701
is a carpenter, Mr. Ryuhei Hosoi.

234
00:13:13,701 --> 00:13:15,301
"Subaru Okiya (27)" -The one with glasses

235
00:13:15,301 --> 00:13:18,777
is a post-graduate student, Mr. Subaru Okiya.

236
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:20,501
"Ginya Makabe (29)" -And the plump one

237
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:23,801
is a freelancer, Mr. Ginya Makabe.

238
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:27,501
I wonder which one among them is the Yellow Person.

239
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:31,401
Inspector, what's this "yellow person" all about?

240
00:13:31,401 --> 00:13:34,501
Oh, right. Take a look at this.

241
00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:37,101
It's a diary written by the son of the landlord.

242
00:13:37,101 --> 00:13:41,201
And it seems like Kaito asked these kids

243
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:44,801
the day before the incident

244
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:47,501
to check on a resident who was acting suspicious.

245
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:48,807
We're not ordinary kids!

246
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:50,801
We have an official name.

247
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:53,101
We're the Youth Detective Squad!

248
00:13:53,101 --> 00:13:56,501
Right, it is written in the diary.

249
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:58,817
What bothers me is that the residents of this apartment

250
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:01,701
are referred to as colours.

251
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:05,101
From what is written here, it seems like this Yellow Person

252
00:14:05,101 --> 00:14:07,501
is unmistakably the culprit.

253
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:10,201
Even so, we can't tell

254
00:14:10,201 --> 00:14:13,501
which one of them is the Yellow Person.

255
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:16,835
None of the three has a name that relates to colours.

256
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:19,901
No one's wearing yellow clothes either.

257
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,101
They work as a carpenter,

258
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:23,401
a post-graduate student and a freelancer respectively.

259
00:14:23,401 --> 00:14:26,401
None of those jobs reminds us of colours.

260
00:14:26,401 --> 00:14:29,201
Red, white and yellow.

261
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,201
They sound like colours of flowers.

262
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:35,801
There's a black one.

263
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:37,501
-The Black Person? -See.

264
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,101
That tanned man.

265
00:14:40,101 --> 00:14:42,101
If it refers to skin colour, the one with glasses

266
00:14:42,101 --> 00:14:43,701
is the White Person.

267
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:48,867
Anyway, let's delve deeper and look for

268
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:50,869
the culprit who is the Yellow Person

269
00:14:51,101 --> 00:14:53,501
and find out what he did.

270
00:14:55,201 --> 00:14:58,877
Gosh. How many times do I have to repeat myself?

271
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:00,401
During the night of the fire,

272
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:04,401
I was drinking with my boss and other fellow carpenters.

273
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:06,885
But we've just confirmed

274
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:10,889
that you disappeared not long after 1 am.

275
00:15:11,101 --> 00:15:14,001
Yes. I was totally wasted

276
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:16,895
because I hadn't drunk in a long time.

277
00:15:17,101 --> 00:15:18,897
I was trying to clear some alcohol out of my body,

278
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:21,601
so I lay down on a bench and fell asleep.

279
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:24,401
When I woke up, it was already morning.

280
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:27,901
So, that means nobody was with you at around 2.30 am

281
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:31,501
when the fire occurred?

282
00:15:31,501 --> 00:15:32,911
No, there wasn't.

283
00:15:33,101 --> 00:15:34,601
What happened?

284
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,601
There's a band aid on your face.

285
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:38,201
Did you get into a fight or something?

286
00:15:38,201 --> 00:15:40,401
Who's that kid?

287
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:42,101
Just answer him.

288
00:15:42,101 --> 00:15:45,601
I accidentally hit my face with a block of wood at work.

289
00:15:45,601 --> 00:15:47,701
I'm still a newbie at it.

290
00:15:47,701 --> 00:15:50,001
See. I have wounds everywhere.

291
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:52,931
By the way, what's your favourite colour?

292
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:54,601
Colour?

293
00:15:54,601 --> 00:15:56,501
The blue colour of the sea.

294
00:15:56,501 --> 00:15:59,301
I like to go surfing occasionally.

295
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:03,201
No, I went driving alone that night.

296
00:16:03,201 --> 00:16:06,501
Whenever I get stuck writing the thesis I have to hand in to my professor,

297
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:08,947
I go driving for a change of mood.

298
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:11,201
Where did you drive to?

299
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:14,101
The tree-lined street along Teimusu River.

300
00:16:14,101 --> 00:16:15,601
I always go there

301
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:18,957
because the greenery makes me relaxed.

302
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:21,801
I'm also the one who waters the plants

303
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:24,963
in the yard of this apartment every day.

304
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:26,401
It seems like the landlord isn't all that interested

305
00:16:26,401 --> 00:16:28,967
in taking care of the yard.

306
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:32,971
If so, do you like the colour green?

307
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:34,401
Not really.

308
00:16:34,401 --> 00:16:36,975
If I have to pick a colour,

309
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:39,401
I'd say my favourite is black.

310
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:41,801
It hides the part inside of me

311
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,901
that I don't want anyone to know about.

312
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:46,001
But then, I also dislike the colour black

313
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:48,987
for the same reason.

314
00:16:50,101 --> 00:16:53,901
I went to a theater in Haido-cho last night to watch movies.

315
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:56,995
It was an all-night movie from 10 pm to 5 am.

316
00:16:57,201 --> 00:16:58,701
It was a continuous showing

317
00:16:58,701 --> 00:17:00,201
of three movies of the "Monster Gomera" series.

318
00:17:00,201 --> 00:17:02,301
-Did you go alone? -Yes.

319
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:05,003
An online friend who was supposed to go with me

320
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:07,001
suddenly couldn't make it.

321
00:17:07,001 --> 00:17:09,401
An online friend?

322
00:17:09,401 --> 00:17:11,901
My hobby is day-trading,

323
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:16,401
so I have friends who exchange information about it with me online.

324
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:20,201
Day-trading? Do you mean stock exchange?

325
00:17:20,201 --> 00:17:22,401
Well, it's just a hobby,

326
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:25,301
so I make very little money out of it.

327
00:17:25,301 --> 00:17:27,701
I heard you're a freelancer.

328
00:17:27,701 --> 00:17:30,001
Are you able to make a living from it?

329
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:31,501
I'm registered as a temporary staff

330
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:32,801
and get paid on a day-to-day basis.

331
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,701
Is your job...

332
00:17:34,701 --> 00:17:37,035
related to construction?

333
00:17:38,201 --> 00:17:42,001
Because there's a lot of dirt in your fingernails.

334
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:44,401
No. It's...

335
00:17:44,401 --> 00:17:47,701
from a survival game that I played the other day.

336
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:50,701
I ran around in the mountains.

337
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:52,501
I was beaten so bad that I ruined my clothes

338
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:55,053
because the paint wouldn't come off.

339
00:17:55,301 --> 00:17:57,055
Then, is your favourite colour

340
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:59,501
the colour frequently used on camouflage outfits?

341
00:17:59,501 --> 00:18:02,501
-Navy... -Yes.

342
00:18:02,501 --> 00:18:04,701
Navy green.

343
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:08,601
Officer, do our favourite colours

344
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:10,701
have anything to do with the fire?

345
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:13,801
Well, there are a lot of things involved.

346
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:16,501
Mitsuhiko.

347
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:18,801
Will you help me?

348
00:18:18,801 --> 00:18:19,801
Sure.

349
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:22,401
Stay still and walk backwards from here.

350
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,601
That's all I need you to do.

351
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:26,101
You want me to step backwards?

352
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:29,087
-Is there anything behind? -Don't look elsewhere.

353
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:32,201
Just keep looking at me.

354
00:18:32,201 --> 00:18:34,801
-Can you do that? -Yes.

355
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:38,801
He's here.

356
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:41,101
He must be somewhere around here.

357
00:18:41,101 --> 00:18:43,501
The member of the Organization

358
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:45,401
who made me feel the pressure.

359
00:18:46,601 --> 00:18:49,107
I've got to hurry and figure out who it is.

360
00:18:49,301 --> 00:18:51,109
If I don't do something quickly,

361
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:53,111
I'll end up getting these children involved.

362
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:55,113
Ai, it hurts.

363
00:18:58,201 --> 00:19:00,301
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

364
00:19:00,301 --> 00:19:02,701
Yes! I'm fine!

365
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:06,401
I just scrapped my elbow a bit.

366
00:19:06,401 --> 00:19:08,301
Here.

367
00:19:08,301 --> 00:19:10,801
Use this, it's a band aid.

368
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:13,901
Thank you! Isn't this yours?

369
00:19:13,901 --> 00:19:15,133
Don't worry about it.

370
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:17,701
I have it on me all the time because people tell me to keep it handy

371
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:20,601
since I hurt my head a lot.

372
00:19:23,801 --> 00:19:26,101
If it has nothing to do with their favourite colour,

373
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:29,147
what on earth does he mean by the Yellow Person?

374
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:30,701
Inspector.

375
00:19:30,701 --> 00:19:33,151
Don't you think it's a bit risky to believe everything

376
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:35,153
the boy has written in his diary?

377
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:37,501
He might have made them up.

378
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:39,157
I don't think so!

379
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:40,701
He told us

380
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:43,701
that somebody was doing suspicious things at night!

381
00:19:43,701 --> 00:19:47,165
It didn't sound like he was making up a story!

382
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:50,801
Right. Besides, if officers find children who did something bad,

383
00:19:50,801 --> 00:19:56,201
you start by asking adults around them to get an idea

384
00:19:56,201 --> 00:19:59,177
on how the child's character is, right?

385
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:03,181
So, it's possible if it's the other way around, isn't it?

386
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:04,801
Although Kaito's a child,

387
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:07,601
he observed the residents very closely

388
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:10,101
and gave them nicknames.

389
00:20:10,101 --> 00:20:13,191
It's like Copper Beeches.

390
00:20:13,401 --> 00:20:15,201
This is a dialogue that Holmes said to Dr. Watson

391
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:18,301
in "The Adventure of the Copper Beeches".

392
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:19,801
"Dr. Watson.

393
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:23,501
In order to grasp the character of a child,

394
00:20:23,501 --> 00:20:28,501
you always start by checking his parents, don't you?

395
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:32,801
Don't you think it can also work the other way around?"

396
00:20:32,801 --> 00:20:35,213
Was that how he said it?

397
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:37,601
So you like Holmes too.

398
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:40,901
Yes, I had every one of the books,

399
00:20:40,901 --> 00:20:43,601
but they're all burnt now.

400
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:45,801
Let's not talk about Holmes for now.

401
00:20:45,801 --> 00:20:48,601
We can't ignore this diary all together.

402
00:20:48,601 --> 00:20:50,201
Sir.

403
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:53,231
May I have a look at the diary?

404
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:55,001
Sure, here you go.

405
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:56,501
Thank you.

406
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:58,201
-Inspector! -Yes?

407
00:20:58,201 --> 00:20:59,901
Did you find something else?

408
00:20:59,901 --> 00:21:01,239
Yes.

409
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:03,241
Many toy cars were found

410
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:05,243
from the area around Kaito's room.

411
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:07,245
Toy cars?

412
00:21:07,401 --> 00:21:09,701
It's not surprising that toy cars can be found

413
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,249
in a child's room, is it?

414
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:13,901
But there are too many of them.

415
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:16,201
I think there are over 100 of them.

416
00:21:16,201 --> 00:21:17,801
What is this?

417
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:19,257
What do you mean?

418
00:21:19,257 --> 00:21:20,201
What is it?

419
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:23,001
Look at this. The word "edogawa"

420
00:21:23,001 --> 00:21:24,901
has been erased and re-written repeatedly.

421
00:21:24,901 --> 00:21:26,301
It's a little black here.

422
00:21:26,301 --> 00:21:28,901
Maybe he tried to write it in Kanji.

423
00:21:28,901 --> 00:21:33,271
No. Isn't the faded writing below it Katakana?

424
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:35,701
Could it be "kuroshi"?

425
00:21:35,701 --> 00:21:39,277
-Kuroshi? -It's Kuroshiro.

426
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:41,301
When I called the hospital a while ago,

427
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,701
Kaito's mother told me something.

428
00:21:43,701 --> 00:21:45,283
Kaito called her,

429
00:21:45,283 --> 00:21:46,801
saying that a very smart boy

430
00:21:46,801 --> 00:21:48,901
who rapidly solves the cases in his school

431
00:21:48,901 --> 00:21:50,501
would be coming over the next day

432
00:21:50,501 --> 00:21:52,401
and he was so happy about it.

433
00:21:52,401 --> 00:21:55,293
She said that the nickname Kaito gave that boy

434
00:21:55,293 --> 00:21:57,601
was Kuroshiro.

435
00:21:57,601 --> 00:22:00,901
Then, the "kuroshi" Kaito kept saying yesterday...

436
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:03,301
it referred to Conan!

437
00:22:03,301 --> 00:22:06,501
But why did he call him Kuroshiro?

438
00:22:06,501 --> 00:22:07,601
Well.

439
00:22:07,601 --> 00:22:10,301
I guess we'll have to wait for Kaito to recover

440
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:12,601
and ask him then.

441
00:22:12,601 --> 00:22:14,301
No.

442
00:22:14,301 --> 00:22:16,901
There's no need to do so.

443
00:22:19,701 --> 00:22:22,801
I, Kuroshiro,

444
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:26,901
will now reveal the truth as clear as black and white.

445
00:22:26,901 --> 00:22:28,901
As well as which one among them

446
00:22:28,901 --> 00:22:32,701
is the yellow arsonist.

447
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,506
Next Conan's Hint:

448
00:24:04,506 --> 00:24:06,166
"Toy car"

449
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:08,198
Is that a dish with pig ears?

450
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:09,427
That's a snail.

451
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:10,840
Are you his parent?
