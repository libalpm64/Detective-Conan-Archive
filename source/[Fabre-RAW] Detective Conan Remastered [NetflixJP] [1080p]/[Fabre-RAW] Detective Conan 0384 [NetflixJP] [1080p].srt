00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,980
Today marks the 10th year for the Detective Conan Series.

2
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,280
In the first episode of this commemorative year,

3
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,980
of all things, Pop's becomes the target of a sniper.

4
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,380
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,180
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,880
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,122
Are you all right?

8
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:05,222
Shall I go flag a cab down?

9
00:02:05,222 --> 00:02:08,922
I'm just fine.

10
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:10,422
Thanks for the service and goodnight.

11
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,122
Take care and goodnight.

12
00:02:12,122 --> 00:02:13,622
Please be careful.

13
00:02:13,622 --> 00:02:15,022
Goodnight.

14
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:56,722
Hey, watch out!

15
00:02:56,722 --> 00:02:58,822
You're lucky it was me because I was able to dodge it.

16
00:03:03,222 --> 00:03:09,422
"The Target is Kogoro Mouri"

17
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,822
Hey! Stay still.

18
00:03:14,022 --> 00:03:15,922
It stings, Ran.

19
00:03:15,922 --> 00:03:18,322
Can't you do it a bit more gently and softly?

20
00:03:18,322 --> 00:03:22,222
Oh, come on! It's nothing to make such a big deal out of, Dad.

21
00:03:22,222 --> 00:03:24,222
A little sting won't kill you.

22
00:03:24,222 --> 00:03:27,422
I've got to go and caution the person in charge tomorrow.

23
00:03:30,022 --> 00:03:31,922
Who could it be at this time of night?

24
00:03:34,622 --> 00:03:36,122
What is this?

25
00:03:36,122 --> 00:03:37,822
It's mail.

26
00:03:39,022 --> 00:03:40,122
What?

27
00:03:40,122 --> 00:03:41,922
Dad, what's up?

28
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,222
Huh?

29
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:47,822
It says, "I won't fail next time. I'll kill you for sure."

30
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:51,522
Does this mean that it was no accident,

31
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:53,522
but something that happened with the intent to kill?

32
00:03:53,522 --> 00:03:55,822
What a dirty rat.

33
00:03:55,822 --> 00:03:58,622
The culprit was ambushing me there.

34
00:03:58,622 --> 00:04:01,922
Dad, don't you have any idea who it could be?

35
00:04:01,922 --> 00:04:04,222
No, not the slightest.

36
00:04:04,222 --> 00:04:06,522
Well, I guess you can't really say

37
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:08,822
that there's no one who has a grudge against me.

38
00:04:08,822 --> 00:04:10,322
You think someone repaid your kindness with a grudge?

39
00:04:10,322 --> 00:04:13,822
Yes. If so, we'll find out soon who it is.

40
00:04:13,822 --> 00:04:16,122
The culprit must always has a motive.

41
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,622
This time, it's a grudge against me.

42
00:04:18,622 --> 00:04:20,722
If I search for those who have a grudge against me,

43
00:04:20,722 --> 00:04:23,822
it'll inevitably lead to the culprit.

44
00:04:23,822 --> 00:04:27,422
Hey, this cell phone is not yours, Dad.

45
00:04:27,422 --> 00:04:29,122
-What? -Huh?

46
00:04:29,122 --> 00:04:30,722
Show it to me.

47
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:32,322
True.

48
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:35,922
Hey! This jacket isn't yours either, Dad.

49
00:04:35,922 --> 00:04:37,522
What?

50
00:04:37,522 --> 00:04:39,422
There's a name on it.

51
00:04:39,422 --> 00:04:40,922
Kimura.

52
00:04:40,922 --> 00:04:44,122
In other words, this cell phone is not yours,

53
00:04:44,122 --> 00:04:46,722
but rather of someone name Kimura.

54
00:04:46,722 --> 00:04:50,322
Which means this mail was not sent to me.

55
00:04:50,322 --> 00:04:53,722
So that's the story. No fun.

56
00:04:53,722 --> 00:04:55,022
Hey. Just where do you think you're going?

57
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,322
I'm going to sleep.

58
00:04:59,322 --> 00:05:00,422
There you go.

59
00:05:03,722 --> 00:05:05,322
It hurts.

60
00:05:05,322 --> 00:05:06,622
Conan?

61
00:05:08,022 --> 00:05:10,022
What a sight.

62
00:05:12,022 --> 00:05:15,122
Hey. What do you think, Conan?

63
00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:17,622
You mean if there's anything besides the fact that Pop's life is in danger

64
00:05:17,622 --> 00:05:20,122
because he mistakenly wore Mr. Kimura's jacket

65
00:05:20,122 --> 00:05:22,322
and the killer mistook Pops to be Mr. Kimura?

66
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,922
Right, I'll try and call Dad's cell phone.

67
00:05:28,422 --> 00:05:32,222
I wonder what kind of person the owner of the cell phone is.

68
00:05:32,222 --> 00:05:34,322
There's no answer.

69
00:05:38,322 --> 00:05:41,422
This is unmistakably Mr. Kimura's jacket.

70
00:05:41,422 --> 00:05:43,522
Did Mr. Kimura come last night?

71
00:05:43,522 --> 00:05:47,222
He came when Mr. Mouri was asleep over there.

72
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,522
I think it was around 1am.

73
00:05:49,522 --> 00:05:53,522
And where is this Mr. Kimura living?

74
00:05:53,522 --> 00:05:57,522
I wonder? He's only started coming here recently, so...

75
00:05:59,022 --> 00:06:03,022
As for me, I found out his name from his signature on this bottle.

76
00:06:03,022 --> 00:06:05,322
Is that so?

77
00:06:05,322 --> 00:06:08,522
I'm sure he'll show up sometime soon.

78
00:06:08,522 --> 00:06:11,022
Let's forget about this for a while.

79
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:12,522
Do you have it?

80
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:16,222
The hand-made cheese that this master makes is super spicy.

81
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:20,422
It blows up your cells, makes your body hot and sweaty.

82
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,322
One should refrain from eating too much of it, but that's just impossible.

83
00:06:23,322 --> 00:06:25,522
That's how good it is.

84
00:06:25,522 --> 00:06:26,622
I see.

85
00:06:26,622 --> 00:06:28,422
So that's why he took off his jacket.

86
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,722
After checking the cell phone that sent out the mail last night,

87
00:06:32,722 --> 00:06:35,522
we found that it was registered under a false name.

88
00:06:35,522 --> 00:06:38,322
And from last night up to now there have been no accidents

89
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:42,722
in which a man by the name of Kimura has been involved.

90
00:06:42,722 --> 00:06:45,122
It's probably just some prank.

91
00:06:45,122 --> 00:06:49,922
The police are busy so you shouldn't cause them extra problems, Ran.

92
00:06:49,922 --> 00:06:51,422
But...

93
00:06:51,422 --> 00:06:54,722
Besides, they're not after me. But a man named Kimura.

94
00:06:54,722 --> 00:06:57,822
The culprit made a mistake.

95
00:06:57,822 --> 00:07:00,922
But if the culprit doesn't realize that he's making a mistake,

96
00:07:00,922 --> 00:07:04,522
he'll go after your life again.

97
00:07:04,522 --> 00:07:07,122
That's what Ran is worried about.

98
00:07:08,822 --> 00:07:13,422
Officer Takagi, don't take what a kid like her is saying too seriously.

99
00:07:15,822 --> 00:07:17,322
Bar Lemon, right?

100
00:07:17,322 --> 00:07:20,122
You sure go looking for all kinds of places to drink, don't you?

101
00:07:26,122 --> 00:07:28,322
About a week ago,

102
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:33,122
I was able to get the service coupons at their grand opening.

103
00:07:33,122 --> 00:07:34,222
So I went to check the place out.

104
00:07:34,222 --> 00:07:37,122
They served this super spicy hot cheese along with the drinks.

105
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:39,522
Since I've kind of been hooked on spicy hot stuff lately,

106
00:07:39,522 --> 00:07:42,022
I got hooked on this place, you see.

107
00:07:42,022 --> 00:07:43,822
-Officer Takagi. -Yes!

108
00:07:43,822 --> 00:07:45,322
There's been an eye-witness report.

109
00:07:45,322 --> 00:07:48,522
Last night a student living near the construction site

110
00:07:48,522 --> 00:07:52,822
says he saw a man running from the scene right after the steel pipes fell.

111
00:07:52,822 --> 00:07:55,522
He says he didn't get a good look at the face of the man though.

112
00:07:55,522 --> 00:07:58,322
However, the culprit seems to have had a burn wound on his right elbow.

113
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,922
Do you have any idea who the man could be?

114
00:08:03,322 --> 00:08:06,822
Unfortunately, there were no other suspicious fingerprints

115
00:08:06,822 --> 00:08:09,422
or anything else at the site.

116
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:13,722
Which means, you'll have to find Mr. Kimura and trace things from there.

117
00:08:13,722 --> 00:08:16,922
Dad! You're talking like it's someone else's problem,

118
00:08:16,922 --> 00:08:19,022
-but what it all boil's down to is... -I'm not Mr. Kimura.

119
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:23,822
This all happened because you went to that bar.

120
00:08:23,822 --> 00:08:27,322
Pops! Unless we hurry, the man called Kimura may be attacked again

121
00:08:27,322 --> 00:08:30,122
and get into bigger trouble next time.

122
00:08:32,522 --> 00:08:33,622
Mr. Kimura...

123
00:08:33,622 --> 00:08:35,622
Since the size of this jacket fits Dad just right,

124
00:08:35,622 --> 00:08:38,122
I think he has the same type of physique as Dad.

125
00:08:38,122 --> 00:08:40,722
Have you ever kept his jacket for him?

126
00:08:40,722 --> 00:08:43,122
There is no such person at our shop.

127
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,722
I see.

128
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:51,922
Look out!

129
00:08:55,022 --> 00:08:56,222
Ran!

130
00:09:03,522 --> 00:09:04,522
Darn it!

131
00:09:10,222 --> 00:09:11,422
Hold it there!

132
00:09:18,522 --> 00:09:20,222
A burn on his right elbow?

133
00:09:35,522 --> 00:09:38,622
The truck was a stolen one after all.

134
00:09:38,622 --> 00:09:41,922
Which means it was a planned attempt.

135
00:09:41,922 --> 00:09:43,322
I think so, too.

136
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,922
What's up, Mr. Mouri?

137
00:09:52,922 --> 00:09:54,922
"Kimura. Next time, I will kill you for sure."

138
00:09:58,722 --> 00:10:01,922
Inspector! The laundry shop owner has completed being treated.

139
00:10:01,922 --> 00:10:04,122
They say he'll be discharged in two or three days.

140
00:10:04,122 --> 00:10:07,222
How dare he get others who aren't involved into danger.

141
00:10:07,222 --> 00:10:09,422
Mr. Mouri, just where do you plan on going?

142
00:10:09,422 --> 00:10:12,922
Where else? I want to nab that guy.

143
00:10:12,922 --> 00:10:15,022
Come on, you don't even know where he is.

144
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:16,822
Just where do you plan to look for him?

145
00:10:16,822 --> 00:10:18,222
Mr. Mouri.

146
00:10:18,222 --> 00:10:22,222
Who cares? I'll find him with my spirit.

147
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,422
Just what are you talking about?

148
00:10:24,422 --> 00:10:27,022
Please stay in one place until we find the culprit.

149
00:10:27,022 --> 00:10:29,822
They're right. Somebody's after you life, you know.

150
00:10:29,822 --> 00:10:31,722
I can't do that.

151
00:10:31,722 --> 00:10:34,022
I, the world famous Kogoro Mouri

152
00:10:34,022 --> 00:10:38,322
hiding just because he's scared of having his life take away.

153
00:10:38,322 --> 00:10:40,722
It'd ruin my reputation.

154
00:10:40,722 --> 00:10:43,322
Come off it! You don't have to bluff courage.

155
00:10:43,322 --> 00:10:44,822
Right, Conan?

156
00:10:46,222 --> 00:10:48,522
Bluff courage?

157
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:52,022
You actually think I'm bluffing courage or what?

158
00:10:52,022 --> 00:10:53,722
You've got to be kidding!

159
00:10:53,722 --> 00:10:57,422
Somebody's after my life you say?

160
00:10:57,422 --> 00:10:59,722
Just great.

161
00:10:59,722 --> 00:11:01,722
What better chance could there be?

162
00:11:01,722 --> 00:11:05,422
As long as we don't know who this Kimura guy is,

163
00:11:05,422 --> 00:11:09,322
I'll serve as decoy and lure the culprit out.

164
00:11:09,322 --> 00:11:12,022
Wait a minute! Just what do you think you're saying, Mr. Mouri?

165
00:11:12,022 --> 00:11:15,322
I can't stop him if I keep on hiding.

166
00:11:17,122 --> 00:11:19,422
-Okay. -Inspector!

167
00:11:19,422 --> 00:11:23,022
But I'm going to have those two serve as your bodyguards.

168
00:11:23,022 --> 00:11:24,622
No way.

169
00:11:24,622 --> 00:11:26,822
It'll only put the culprit on guard if he finds out

170
00:11:26,822 --> 00:11:27,922
and he won't show himself.

171
00:11:27,922 --> 00:11:29,022
No!

172
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,122
Going out alone is much too dangerous.

173
00:11:31,122 --> 00:11:33,222
I hate to say this, inspector.

174
00:11:33,222 --> 00:11:35,322
But I can't listen to you this time.

175
00:11:35,322 --> 00:11:40,322
I can't bear and don't want any more victims resulting from this.

176
00:11:40,322 --> 00:11:42,522
But if anything should happen to me,

177
00:11:42,522 --> 00:11:45,422
please take care of what needs to be done after that.

178
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:48,722
Mr. Mouri.

179
00:11:48,722 --> 00:11:51,022
It seemed to have the opposite effect.

180
00:11:51,022 --> 00:11:53,522
-Mr. Mouri. -He's quite defiant.

181
00:11:56,222 --> 00:12:03,922
So what we've got to do now is to find the person called Kimura.

182
00:12:03,922 --> 00:12:05,122
Yes, sir.

183
00:12:05,122 --> 00:12:06,322
Let's go, Officer Takagi.

184
00:12:06,322 --> 00:12:07,422
Okay!

185
00:12:26,022 --> 00:12:29,022
He's been walking around for the past three days.

186
00:12:29,022 --> 00:12:30,522
Yes, sir.

187
00:12:30,522 --> 00:12:33,522
And what about this Mr. Kimura?

188
00:12:33,522 --> 00:12:36,322
We're still looking. We're doing everything we can.

189
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,922
But if the motive of the culprit is a grudge against Mr. Mouri,

190
00:12:38,922 --> 00:12:41,022
I guess we'll eventually get the guy.

191
00:12:41,022 --> 00:12:45,322
But the thing is, he's being sought after mistaken for a man named Kimura,

192
00:12:45,322 --> 00:12:48,722
and he has no idea who or where this Kimura person is.

193
00:12:48,722 --> 00:12:50,622
Moreover, after two attempted tries on Mr. Mouri's life,

194
00:12:50,622 --> 00:12:54,122
the culprit left nothing behind, not even fingerprints.

195
00:12:54,122 --> 00:12:55,822
I really hate to say this

196
00:12:55,822 --> 00:12:59,222
but at present we're up the creek without a paddle.

197
00:12:59,222 --> 00:13:00,622
Fingerprints.

198
00:13:00,622 --> 00:13:03,722
He didn't want to get nabbed from his fingerprints?

199
00:13:03,722 --> 00:13:06,422
So the culprit's fingerprints are already registered?

200
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:09,222
Which means, this person has an arrest record.

201
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,522
One who knows Pops well.

202
00:13:11,522 --> 00:13:14,522
But he has no motive against Pops.

203
00:13:14,522 --> 00:13:15,622
Wait a second.

204
00:13:15,622 --> 00:13:18,622
If the culprit knows Pops and has met him before...

205
00:13:20,722 --> 00:13:22,322
It could be that...

206
00:13:27,776 --> 00:13:29,976
This is Mouri. Long time no see.

207
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,576
I'd like to ask you something

208
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:34,776
about a certain case that I solved in the past.

209
00:13:37,376 --> 00:13:40,376
What's all the noise outside?

210
00:13:43,576 --> 00:13:44,676
Come on out.

211
00:13:44,676 --> 00:13:47,676
I know that you're hiding over there.

212
00:13:47,676 --> 00:13:52,176
I advise you to come out before I crush you to a pulp.

213
00:13:52,176 --> 00:13:54,076
There's nothing to think about, is there?

214
00:13:54,076 --> 00:13:55,876
Resign yourself and come on out.

215
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,876
Come out. Or else I'm going to come get you.

216
00:13:57,876 --> 00:14:00,076
No, please don't. Please forgive me.

217
00:14:00,076 --> 00:14:03,976
I'm sorry. I will return what I stole.

218
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,576
Dad.

219
00:14:05,576 --> 00:14:07,576
What? What's going on?

220
00:14:07,576 --> 00:14:10,776
You're fantastic, Dad. It's a robber. Good job!

221
00:14:13,876 --> 00:14:16,976
A case in which luck and coincidence overlapped.

222
00:14:16,976 --> 00:14:19,476
Why don't you rest a while, Conan?

223
00:14:19,476 --> 00:14:22,376
I wonder if that person called Kimura not only resembles dad in physique,

224
00:14:22,376 --> 00:14:24,976
but looks alike, too.

225
00:14:24,976 --> 00:14:27,476
Because don't they say that there are three people

226
00:14:27,476 --> 00:14:29,276
who resemble you existing in this world?

227
00:14:31,076 --> 00:14:32,476
Three people with a face like his?

228
00:14:33,976 --> 00:14:35,876
People who look alike.

229
00:14:38,176 --> 00:14:41,676
Yes, I got a call from Mr. Kimura's wife.

230
00:14:41,676 --> 00:14:45,076
And it seems she realized that her husband was wearing the wrong jacket.

231
00:14:45,076 --> 00:14:46,576
Talk about easygoing.

232
00:14:46,576 --> 00:14:49,776
Mr. Kimura seems to have gone out to take pictures.

233
00:14:49,776 --> 00:14:54,276
Yes, sir. And Mr. Mouri, Mrs. Kimura just happened to say

234
00:14:54,276 --> 00:14:58,576
that a strange man was checking out their house.

235
00:14:58,576 --> 00:15:00,576
He had a wound on his right elbow?

236
00:15:00,576 --> 00:15:02,976
And, where is Mr. Kimura?

237
00:15:02,976 --> 00:15:03,976
Lake Beika?

238
00:15:03,976 --> 00:15:05,876
The strange man is trailing him.

239
00:15:05,876 --> 00:15:08,776
Okay, it's very likely.

240
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:11,476
Are you going there too, Mr. Mouri?

241
00:15:11,476 --> 00:15:13,876
I think that's dangerous.

242
00:15:13,876 --> 00:15:15,876
What a short-tempered man.

243
00:15:26,076 --> 00:15:27,576
Money?

244
00:15:27,576 --> 00:15:30,376
I dropped it and it went under the car.

245
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:33,576
Okay! I'll move the car and look for it.

246
00:15:33,576 --> 00:15:35,676
Really? I'm glad. Thank you!

247
00:15:39,776 --> 00:15:41,276
Just as I thought.

248
00:15:49,976 --> 00:15:51,576
Manicure?

249
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,276
I found it.

250
00:15:54,276 --> 00:15:55,876
Thank you, sir.

251
00:15:56,876 --> 00:15:59,576
Inspector? This is Kogoro.

252
00:15:59,576 --> 00:16:01,776
I've found out where Mr. Kimura is.

253
00:16:01,776 --> 00:16:03,276
What?

254
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:06,476
Mr. Kimura, where are you?

255
00:16:06,476 --> 00:16:09,976
Please answer me, Mr. Kimura!

256
00:16:09,976 --> 00:16:12,976
Hey, it's cold here. So hurry up and show yourself.

257
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:19,576
Yes, this is Kogoro.

258
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:21,576
Oh, Inspector!

259
00:16:21,576 --> 00:16:25,176
I've found out where Mr. Kimura is. He's by the thicket.

260
00:16:25,176 --> 00:16:27,676
And Mr. Mouri, take care not to catch cold because it's cold.

261
00:16:30,676 --> 00:16:32,576
Hurry! Hurry!

262
00:16:36,776 --> 00:16:42,376
Mr. Kimura! Mr. Kimura!

263
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:51,076
Mr. Kimura!

264
00:16:53,076 --> 00:16:56,776
Inspector! Isn't that Mr. Mouri on board that boat?

265
00:16:56,776 --> 00:16:57,976
It is Mr. Mouri!

266
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,976
He's out there in clear view with nothing to protect him.

267
00:16:59,976 --> 00:17:02,976
He has no chance against the sniper! Talk about reckless!

268
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:12,276
Inspector.

269
00:17:12,276 --> 00:17:15,176
On the left side of the lakeside opposite here, something glittered.

270
00:17:15,176 --> 00:17:17,276
What? It's a rifle.

271
00:17:17,276 --> 00:17:19,676
It could be the rifle of the sniper who is after Mr. Mouri's life!

272
00:17:19,676 --> 00:17:21,676
-Hurry, Takagi. -Yes, sir!

273
00:17:21,676 --> 00:17:22,676
Mr. Mouri!

274
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:33,576
Mr. Mouri!

275
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:37,476
Save Mr. Mouri!

276
00:17:37,476 --> 00:17:39,976
-Hurry! Hurry! -Yes, sir...

277
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,476
Officer Takagi, go get the boats.

278
00:17:41,476 --> 00:17:43,976
-Hurry! We've got to save him no matter what. -I'll go ask for support.

279
00:17:43,976 --> 00:17:46,076
Will both of you come with me?

280
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:48,576
Inspector!

281
00:17:48,576 --> 00:17:50,276
Conan.

282
00:17:50,276 --> 00:17:51,576
Where's Pops?

283
00:17:55,776 --> 00:17:57,976
Inspector Megure.

284
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:01,676
We found this in the water.

285
00:18:03,076 --> 00:18:04,176
And?

286
00:18:04,176 --> 00:18:06,876
We could not locate Mr. Mouri though.

287
00:18:10,276 --> 00:18:12,476
The man from Bar Lemon.

288
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:17,876
Yes. I suddenly got a call from Mrs. Kimura,

289
00:18:17,876 --> 00:18:19,576
and couldn't make out the address she gave me.

290
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:24,776
I thought I had to relay the message to Mr. Mouri as soon as possible.

291
00:18:24,776 --> 00:18:26,876
I had no idea that things would turn out like this.

292
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:33,676
It sure gets cold when the sun goes down, Mr. Kimura.

293
00:18:33,676 --> 00:18:36,176
Mr. Mouri! You're okay!

294
00:18:36,176 --> 00:18:39,276
Huh? I picked this up.

295
00:18:39,276 --> 00:18:43,176
I get it. You put a dummy on board the boat and...

296
00:18:43,176 --> 00:18:46,376
Yes, yes. You tried to lure the sniper out.

297
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:49,076
I'm so glad. You are indeed Kogoro Mouri.

298
00:18:49,076 --> 00:18:51,376
Inspector, what about Mr. Kimura?

299
00:18:51,376 --> 00:18:52,776
Did you find him?

300
00:18:55,476 --> 00:18:59,276
Inspector, you don't have to worry about him.

301
00:18:59,276 --> 00:19:00,876
What do you mean?

302
00:19:00,876 --> 00:19:05,276
There is no such person by the name of Kimura to begin with.

303
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:08,176
In other words, the culprit is targeting me.

304
00:19:08,176 --> 00:19:12,176
In order to camouflage his motive towards me,

305
00:19:12,176 --> 00:19:15,176
the sniper made up a character by the name of Kimura.

306
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:17,276
Made up? A motive?

307
00:19:17,276 --> 00:19:20,976
Yes. If I were to be killed,

308
00:19:20,976 --> 00:19:23,676
the police will thoroughly investigate my surroundings

309
00:19:23,676 --> 00:19:27,276
and will be able to trace the sniper from there.

310
00:19:27,276 --> 00:19:31,176
But if I were to be killed because I was mistaken for a man named Kimura,

311
00:19:31,176 --> 00:19:33,376
it will make investigation difficult.

312
00:19:33,376 --> 00:19:37,876
Because there will be nothing connecting me to this man.

313
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,676
Which means that the accident at the construction site,

314
00:19:40,676 --> 00:19:42,376
the hit-and-run after that

315
00:19:42,376 --> 00:19:44,476
and the warning mail of murder to be carried out

316
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:48,176
were all camouflage that the sniper schemed?

317
00:19:48,176 --> 00:19:50,176
Do you have evidence that he doesn't exist?

318
00:19:50,176 --> 00:19:51,476
Then who is the sniper?

319
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:54,176
Now, hold your horses.

320
00:19:54,176 --> 00:19:55,276
Mr. Inoue.

321
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:58,576
You have a briefcase in your car, don't you?

322
00:19:58,576 --> 00:20:00,576
Could we have a look at it?

323
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:01,576
Yes, go ahead.

324
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:03,676
I'll go get it.

325
00:20:03,676 --> 00:20:04,976
It's in the trunk.

326
00:20:04,976 --> 00:20:06,576
By the way, Mr. Inoue.

327
00:20:06,576 --> 00:20:10,176
You gave me the service coupon in Bar Lemon

328
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:12,976
just to provide services for me.

329
00:20:12,976 --> 00:20:16,476
You waited for an opportunity.

330
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:18,776
When I fell asleep after getting drunk,

331
00:20:18,776 --> 00:20:22,776
you exchanged the jacket and cell phone that you had prepared with mine.

332
00:20:22,776 --> 00:20:24,976
No. Mr. Kimura really came and...

333
00:20:24,976 --> 00:20:26,476
He went home after he had a drink?

334
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:29,176
But he only drank water.

335
00:20:29,176 --> 00:20:32,476
The contents of Mr. Kimura's bottle was water.

336
00:20:32,476 --> 00:20:34,076
Inspector, I found it.

337
00:20:36,976 --> 00:20:38,176
This is...

338
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:40,476
The rifle that fired at me.

339
00:20:40,476 --> 00:20:43,376
Do you have proof that I fired it?

340
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:44,676
In that dummy over there,

341
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,476
you can find the bullet of a rifle in its left chest.

342
00:20:47,476 --> 00:20:50,276
If you match the bullet and the traces that the bullet left behind,

343
00:20:50,276 --> 00:20:53,076
and if the rifle mark matches,

344
00:20:53,076 --> 00:20:55,076
it will serve as immovable evidence.

345
00:20:55,076 --> 00:20:58,476
But I have no motive to go after Mr. Mouri's life.

346
00:20:58,476 --> 00:21:00,976
You do. You have a grudge against me.

347
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:02,676
Please look through the file.

348
00:21:02,676 --> 00:21:04,976
-Conan. -Yes, sir.

349
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:05,976
Here you are.

350
00:21:05,976 --> 00:21:07,876
What's this?

351
00:21:07,876 --> 00:21:11,376
The grudge that you have against me for arresting you.

352
00:21:11,376 --> 00:21:13,576
That picture is of you, back then.

353
00:21:13,576 --> 00:21:15,576
After serving time, you got yourself plastic surgery.

354
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:17,576
Well, I don't know how you did it

355
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,376
but you also changed your family register and became a different person.

356
00:21:20,376 --> 00:21:22,376
Mr. Hiroshi Ukita.

357
00:21:22,376 --> 00:21:24,176
This is your real name.

358
00:21:24,176 --> 00:21:25,576
If you insist that I'm wrong,

359
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,976
let's have you remove the manicure you have on your fingers

360
00:21:27,976 --> 00:21:31,276
with nail polish remover and try matching your fingerprints.

361
00:21:33,276 --> 00:21:40,076
I finally got myself a girlfriend and needed money to get married to her.

362
00:21:40,076 --> 00:21:43,976
That was the last job I did, but I got nabbed by you.

363
00:21:43,976 --> 00:21:45,976
She left me.

364
00:21:45,976 --> 00:21:47,276
I swore that once I got out,

365
00:21:47,276 --> 00:21:49,476
I would get back at you for messing up my life.

366
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:51,176
Cut out your stupid talk!

367
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:54,976
You could never become happy with money that you had to commit a crime for!

368
00:21:54,976 --> 00:21:57,776
Don't you think that you're a fool for trying to get back at Mr. Mouri

369
00:21:57,776 --> 00:22:01,676
for your own wrongdoing, committing an additional crime?

370
00:23:28,876 --> 00:23:31,476
You never know when someone like me, being such a famous detective,

371
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:34,476
could become a target of some sniper.

372
00:23:34,476 --> 00:23:35,776
I tell you, he's hopeless.

373
00:23:35,776 --> 00:23:39,576
The one in the class next to ours, the boy called Kitada.

374
00:23:39,576 --> 00:23:41,676
A thief! Conan, hold my bag for me, will you?

375
00:23:41,676 --> 00:23:42,976
That person is...

376
00:23:48,676 --> 00:23:49,776
Dad?

377
00:23:51,376 --> 00:23:53,476
What're you doing dressed like that?

378
00:23:53,476 --> 00:23:56,776
If you see any suspicious looking guy, let me know right away.

379
00:23:56,776 --> 00:23:59,876
You're the one who looks most suspicious.

380
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:34,003
Next Conan's Hint:

381
00:24:34,003 --> 00:24:36,403
"Requiem"

382
00:24:36,403 --> 00:24:37,703
The Detective Conan Series enters its 10th year.

383
00:24:37,703 --> 00:24:39,203
I have a feeling something's going to happen this year.

384
00:24:39,203 --> 00:24:41,107
-Root for us, okay? -Root for us, okay?
