1
00:00:03,773 --> 00:00:05,073
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:05,073 --> 00:00:06,373
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:07,987
And start the countdown to deduction and love.

4
00:00:08,173 --> 00:00:10,273
A rival of Shinichi appears again?

5
00:00:10,273 --> 00:00:11,991
A match to solve the mystery of paper planes is launched!

6
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:13,373
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,373 --> 00:00:15,073
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,073 --> 00:00:16,673
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:57,728 --> 00:02:00,828
A new member of the Black Organization has started to make a move.

10
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:02,428
He's skilled in collecting information,

11
00:02:02,428 --> 00:02:05,628
observatory skills and also insightful.

12
00:02:05,628 --> 00:02:08,107
His code name is Bourbon.

13
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:10,109
He shouldn't be taken lightly.

14
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:11,828
Although the case of Kaito Sugiura's apartment

15
00:02:11,828 --> 00:02:14,113
being set fire to was solved,

16
00:02:14,328 --> 00:02:16,828
one of the residents who lost his home in the fire,

17
00:02:16,828 --> 00:02:19,428
Mr. Subaru Okiya, ends up freeloading at my,

18
00:02:19,428 --> 00:02:24,128
that is Shinichi Kudo's house.

19
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,928
Ran and Sonoko, who didn't know about this

20
00:02:25,928 --> 00:02:28,428
mistakenly thought that he was a thief.

21
00:02:31,828 --> 00:02:35,128
I wonder if Subaru who was kicked by Ran is okay?

22
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:41,128
The recent talk of the town is the paper plane prankster.

23
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:44,728
Every night close to 100 paper planes are scattered throughout town,

24
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:48,147
and a strange mark is drawn on those planes.

25
00:02:49,028 --> 00:02:51,428
When I saw the image of the paper plane

26
00:02:51,428 --> 00:02:53,628
that Ran had attached to the mail she sent me,

27
00:02:53,628 --> 00:02:57,028
I realized that there was an important message hidden behind it.

28
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,428
The message was...

29
00:03:03,228 --> 00:03:08,428
"Deduction Match! Shinichi vs. Subaru Okiya".

30
00:03:09,028 --> 00:03:11,528
Another type of paper plane?

31
00:03:11,528 --> 00:03:14,173
Yes. If I remember correctly, it said in the news

32
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:15,728
that close to 100 paper planes were retrieved in town

33
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:18,177
the day before yesterday and yesterday morning.

34
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:21,328
So, if the message that is drawn on the paper planes

35
00:03:21,328 --> 00:03:23,628
the day before yesterday and yesterday differ,

36
00:03:23,628 --> 00:03:26,628
I just thought that maybe we could narrow down

37
00:03:26,628 --> 00:03:30,189
the location of the person who sent out the SOS.

38
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:33,328
By the way, when did you find this in your yard?

39
00:03:33,328 --> 00:03:36,195
I found it in the morning the day before yesterday.

40
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:37,528
Before that, tell me, will you?

41
00:03:37,528 --> 00:03:40,828
Why is that paper plane a SOS signal?

42
00:03:40,828 --> 00:03:43,528
It's the design that's drawn on the plane.

43
00:03:43,528 --> 00:03:47,028
The size of the circles in front and back is practically the same.

44
00:03:47,028 --> 00:03:49,628
And the length of the dashes are is as long as the three circles.

45
00:03:49,628 --> 00:03:52,628
And the space between the circles

46
00:03:52,628 --> 00:03:55,228
is just about equal to the size of one circle.

47
00:03:55,228 --> 00:04:00,228
Yes, this is the Morse code that frequently used

48
00:04:00,228 --> 00:04:02,228
as a means of communication.

49
00:04:02,228 --> 00:04:03,828
You mean the Morse Code

50
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:06,528
that usually come out in old movies?

51
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,728
Yes, that's right.

52
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:11,728
The circles are short dots that are made by short taps.

53
00:04:11,728 --> 00:04:14,628
The dashes are long dots made by long taps.

54
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:17,228
In the Morse code, three dots made by short taps equals "S"

55
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:19,528
and three long dots equals "O".

56
00:04:19,528 --> 00:04:22,241
In other words, SOS would be

57
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:27,428
tap tap tap, dash dash dash, tap tap tap.

58
00:04:27,428 --> 00:04:31,628
It's a signal asking for help.

59
00:04:31,628 --> 00:04:33,328
That's what's written in the mail.

60
00:04:33,328 --> 00:04:36,528
No! You mean Shinichi figured it out too?

61
00:04:36,528 --> 00:04:38,257
Yes. It also says

62
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:40,259
he wants to see images of other paper planes if there are any,

63
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:42,028
and he'd like me to send them to him.

64
00:04:42,028 --> 00:04:44,728
Shinichi? Come to think of it,

65
00:04:44,728 --> 00:04:47,928
the name of the owner of this house is Shinichi too, isn't it?

66
00:04:47,928 --> 00:04:49,028
Don't you know him?

67
00:04:49,028 --> 00:04:51,528
He's a high school detective named Shin...

68
00:04:51,528 --> 00:04:52,928
Kinichi.

69
00:04:52,928 --> 00:04:56,728
There's this boy that likes to make a deduction in the same class.

70
00:04:56,728 --> 00:05:00,279
So he's name is Kinichi and not Shinichi?

71
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,281
Yes. The Shinichi that's living here

72
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:05,228
is just an ordinary high school student that can't do much.

73
00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:07,028
An ordinary high school student?

74
00:05:07,028 --> 00:05:10,728
I just can't help feeling otherwise about him though.

75
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:12,291
What makes you say that?

76
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,328
Because there is

77
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:17,428
no trace of anything that shows that he had been living here.

78
00:05:17,428 --> 00:05:18,728
None of his clothes, no diary,

79
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:21,028
or albums and the like are anywhere in sight.

80
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:24,728
Well, at least nowhere that can easily be seen that is.

81
00:05:24,728 --> 00:05:26,728
You think so?

82
00:05:26,728 --> 00:05:29,228
It could be that he didn't want us to see his things

83
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:32,311
knowing that we'd come to clean his place up and hid them all somewhere.

84
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:34,728
Taking about cleaning up,

85
00:05:34,728 --> 00:05:38,317
even the employee that we stopped over at a while ago was told by the owner

86
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:43,928
to clean up the paper plane that was stuck to the sign of the shop, right?

87
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,428
Then let's go get it right away.

88
00:05:47,428 --> 00:05:48,728
Wait, Ran!

89
00:05:52,828 --> 00:05:55,028
Hey, just what's this Kinichi thing about?

90
00:05:55,028 --> 00:05:59,528
That's because Shinichi told me a while ago not to tell that man about him.

91
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:00,928
Shinichi told you that?

92
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,341
It seems that he sent Conan a mail

93
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:05,028
saying that he doesn't want the man to take an interest in him

94
00:06:05,028 --> 00:06:07,728
and start searching around the house for things.

95
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:15,528
I guess detectives like to search around about other people

96
00:06:15,528 --> 00:06:17,528
but don't like it the other way around.

97
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:19,628
Yes.

98
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:21,328
Besides,

99
00:06:21,328 --> 00:06:23,928
I kind of couldn't help stopping myself

100
00:06:23,928 --> 00:06:26,028
from talking about Shinichi to him.

101
00:06:26,028 --> 00:06:31,028
A feeling that I shouldn't. A kind of anxiousness.

102
00:06:31,028 --> 00:06:34,373
Next, we'll try writing the names of flowers in Katakana!

103
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:37,028
Ran is sure taking her time.

104
00:06:37,028 --> 00:06:40,379
It can't be that there was only one type of paper plane.

105
00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:46,385
Finally. Let's see.

106
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:48,028
It seems that the paper planes of yesterday

107
00:06:48,028 --> 00:06:50,028
and the day before yesterday are different.

108
00:06:50,028 --> 00:06:52,391
I'll attach the image.

109
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:53,728
What's this?

110
00:06:53,728 --> 00:06:55,728
There's no design on it.

111
00:06:57,528 --> 00:06:58,928
A closer look at it

112
00:06:58,928 --> 00:07:02,128
shows five dashes on the folded crease of the body of the paper plane.

113
00:07:02,128 --> 00:07:05,528
In Morse code, five long dashes means "zero".

114
00:07:05,528 --> 00:07:07,928
What on earth does the zero stand for?

115
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:12,828
There's a design on the other side too.

116
00:07:12,828 --> 00:07:16,828
But it looks like a line had been drawn along the folded crease.

117
00:07:19,328 --> 00:07:21,128
This... this is...

118
00:07:23,328 --> 00:07:25,528
The mark of an antenna?

119
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,228
Of a cell phone?

120
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:32,228
Really, they're exactly alike!

121
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:34,028
In other words, if you match it up

122
00:07:34,028 --> 00:07:36,028
with the five dashes that are drawn body of the paper plane,

123
00:07:36,028 --> 00:07:37,228
there is zero radio wave.

124
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:40,728
Moreover, taking into consideration the first SOS. The message is,

125
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:43,228
"I'm in a place where cell phones are out of service range,

126
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:46,728
so please help me".

127
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:50,228
Wow! Subaru, you're a fantastic detective.

128
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:52,228
But, all we know now is that

129
00:07:52,228 --> 00:07:54,828
the person is in a place where cell phones are out of range.

130
00:07:54,828 --> 00:07:56,228
Out of service range,

131
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:58,457
you mean in a cave in the remote mountains or something?

132
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:02,461
But the paper planes were retrieved only in town.

133
00:08:02,628 --> 00:08:03,728
Then, maybe in the basement!

134
00:08:03,728 --> 00:08:05,428
How would anyone be able to fly a plane from the basement

135
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:07,528
to the yard of your house Sonoko?

136
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,528
Oh, right.

137
00:08:09,528 --> 00:08:10,828
Wait.

138
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:12,928
If paper planes were retrieved the day before yesterday and yesterday,

139
00:08:12,928 --> 00:08:13,928
I'm sure that even today...

140
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:17,028
I see, the news on TV!

141
00:08:17,028 --> 00:08:19,528
The identity of the kidnapper on the run

142
00:08:19,528 --> 00:08:22,128
who jumped off the building early this morning

143
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:23,528
has not yet been verified.

144
00:08:23,528 --> 00:08:25,928
"Ikuo Shirota" -The whereabouts of the president of the shipbuilding

145
00:08:25,928 --> 00:08:29,128
that has been kidnapped has not been found yet.

146
00:08:29,128 --> 00:08:30,128
The police are

147
00:08:30,128 --> 00:08:32,491
investigating the case as one of a grudge against Mr. Shirota,

148
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:33,928
and are attempting to identify the kidnapper...

149
00:08:33,928 --> 00:08:36,495
Every station is airing news about this incident.

150
00:08:37,428 --> 00:08:38,828
They reported on the morning news

151
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:43,528
that this man used his experience back when he used to be a sailor,

152
00:08:43,528 --> 00:08:45,928
to enlarge his company.

153
00:08:45,928 --> 00:08:47,728
Maybe...

154
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,428
What is it, Subaru?

155
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,128
Maybe this case

156
00:08:51,128 --> 00:08:53,628
is connected in some way with the incident of the paper planes.

157
00:08:54,928 --> 00:08:58,528
If he's been abducted and is being confined somewhere...

158
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:00,519
It's very likely that he's avoiding the eyes of his kidnapper

159
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:03,928
and flying paper planes night after night.

160
00:09:03,928 --> 00:09:07,428
Then, you're saying that President Shirota is the paper plane prankster?

161
00:09:07,428 --> 00:09:10,128
Yes, I think it's very likely.

162
00:09:10,128 --> 00:09:11,628
If he used to be a sailor before,

163
00:09:11,628 --> 00:09:13,828
it's not surprising that he knows how to use the Morse code

164
00:09:13,828 --> 00:09:17,328
that's used in emergencies.

165
00:09:17,328 --> 00:09:20,539
He's probably not aware that the kidnapper committed suicide

166
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:24,028
and is still trying to get help secretly.

167
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:25,428
I see.

168
00:09:25,428 --> 00:09:28,128
Even if the kidnapper happens to see this and pick it up,

169
00:09:28,128 --> 00:09:31,128
he would think nothing of it except as some child's play!

170
00:09:31,128 --> 00:09:32,551
It seems that the paper planes that were retrieved yesterday

171
00:09:32,728 --> 00:09:33,828
and the day before yesterday

172
00:09:33,828 --> 00:09:39,428
were made by ripping off pages from a magazine.

173
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:41,728
President Shirota probably cannot move around much

174
00:09:41,728 --> 00:09:44,928
and the most he can do is get hold of that magazine.

175
00:09:45,828 --> 00:09:47,828
Oh, no.

176
00:09:47,828 --> 00:09:51,528
Now, for a follow-up report on the paper plane prankster.

177
00:09:51,528 --> 00:09:52,571
Here it is!

178
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:56,228
I am at a park near the Beika Tower Condominium

179
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,128
where the paper planes in question were found this morning.

180
00:09:59,128 --> 00:10:02,581
As to the design on the paper planes that are of interest,

181
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:04,583
there is nothing on this side,

182
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,228
but on the opposite side, there is one circle

183
00:10:07,228 --> 00:10:10,928
and four imperfect circles that are drawn symmetrically.

184
00:10:10,928 --> 00:10:12,228
Moreover, at a close look,

185
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:14,128
there is a weird looking crease on it.

186
00:10:14,128 --> 00:10:16,595
The mystery gets even deeper.

187
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:18,128
Crease?

188
00:10:18,128 --> 00:10:20,128
We can't see it very well on the TV.

189
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:34,928
Hey now, it's class time.

190
00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:38,617
But Conan is engrossed in folding paper planes.

191
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:40,228
Hey, Conan.

192
00:10:40,228 --> 00:10:42,028
That's something you should be doing during recess.

193
00:10:42,028 --> 00:10:44,428
I'm sorry, Teacher. But can you leave me alone?

194
00:10:44,428 --> 00:10:46,228
You know what...

195
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:49,328
Somebody's life may be in danger!

196
00:10:49,328 --> 00:10:50,628
Is that right?

197
00:10:50,628 --> 00:10:52,028
Yeah.

198
00:10:52,028 --> 00:10:54,028
The one who's flying this

199
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,428
is probably President Shirota who was kidnapped

200
00:10:56,428 --> 00:10:58,028
and he's being locked up in a place where the cell phones

201
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,028
are out of service range.

202
00:11:00,028 --> 00:11:02,228
The fact that he can fold and fly so many paper planes

203
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,428
despite being in his situation,

204
00:11:04,428 --> 00:11:05,428
just goes to show that it's most likely

205
00:11:05,428 --> 00:11:08,647
that he's being left without getting any care since he's been locked up.

206
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:11,128
If he by chance hasn't eaten or drunk anything,

207
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,028
things may be for the worse.

208
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:15,528
They should be able to narrow down the President's whereabouts

209
00:11:15,528 --> 00:11:18,028
with the paper planes that were retrieved this time.

210
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:19,828
But what is this anyway?

211
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:23,328
These four unclosed circles and strange crase?

212
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:26,665
Wait a sec. If this is also a Morse code,

213
00:11:26,665 --> 00:11:30,228
the unclosed circles are probably a set.

214
00:11:30,228 --> 00:11:31,228
Two circles make a set.

215
00:11:31,228 --> 00:11:32,328
Four circles equal two circles,

216
00:11:32,328 --> 00:11:34,673
plus there is one circle that is originally there...

217
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:38,028
One circle equals "E" and two makes "I".

218
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:42,028
If read romaji style it would either be "ei" or "ie"(house).

219
00:11:42,028 --> 00:11:44,028
Just where is the house anyway?

220
00:11:46,228 --> 00:11:49,128
Subaru.

221
00:11:49,128 --> 00:11:53,128
There are many different ways to fold paper planes, aren't they?

222
00:11:53,128 --> 00:11:54,228
There are many kinds.

223
00:11:54,228 --> 00:11:57,628
Like cicadas and sparrows.

224
00:11:57,628 --> 00:12:02,428
I think there were other things that it resembled that can't even fly.

225
00:12:16,228 --> 00:12:17,928
I see.

226
00:12:17,928 --> 00:12:19,728
It's over here!

227
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:28,727
Hey, Conan, what's that?

228
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:30,729
A paper plane?

229
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:32,731
It looks like a squid!

230
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:34,092
But I think if so,

231
00:12:34,092 --> 00:12:36,735
you'd have to fold the head part once more.

232
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,492
No, this is just fine.

233
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:40,992
The person who flew this

234
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:42,492
wanted to make the people who picked it up

235
00:12:42,492 --> 00:12:44,743
make the paper plane like this.

236
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:47,192
Don't tell me that you're talking about

237
00:12:47,192 --> 00:12:50,292
the paper plane prankster that's the talk of the town now?

238
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:53,292
Yeah, you spread the squid out once like this

239
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:56,755
then, turn the paper upside down and fold the plane.

240
00:12:57,992 --> 00:13:01,192
See, it looks just like the paper planes

241
00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:03,592
that were retrieved today, doesn't it?

242
00:13:03,592 --> 00:13:05,092
I see.

243
00:13:05,092 --> 00:13:08,767
A squid is made by a queer crease and two separated black circles.

244
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:12,771
The person wanted to relay the real message to the people this way.

245
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:16,792
Wait up, wasn't the paper plane thing supposed to be a prank?

246
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:19,392
It seems that the paper planes that were retrieved

247
00:13:19,392 --> 00:13:21,092
the day before yesterday, yesterday and today

248
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:24,092
all had different designs on them.

249
00:13:24,092 --> 00:13:27,792
So, I guess it'd be safe to say some kind of message is behind them?

250
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:30,789
But who for what reason?

251
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:31,992
In order to find out,

252
00:13:31,992 --> 00:13:35,492
we'll need Conan to solve the code first and then...

253
00:13:35,492 --> 00:13:37,392
He's gone?

254
00:13:37,392 --> 00:13:38,492
Conan?

255
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:42,592
Bei?

256
00:13:42,592 --> 00:13:45,592
You mean those three circles mean "bei"?

257
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:47,692
Yes, most likely.

258
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:50,292
This is probably a Japanese Morse code,

259
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:51,992
so one circle would be pronounced "hei",

260
00:13:51,992 --> 00:13:53,992
but since there are two, it indicates a voiced consonant,

261
00:13:53,992 --> 00:13:56,815
so put together, it's pronounced "bei".

262
00:13:58,492 --> 00:14:01,592
But what's the message?

263
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,692
Can't you tell by this shape?

264
00:14:03,692 --> 00:14:05,192
Shape?

265
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:06,292
A squid?

266
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:09,192
So, if you put these two together...

267
00:14:09,192 --> 00:14:10,392
Bei.

268
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,392
Squid. ("Ika" is pronunciation of "squid" in Japanese)

269
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:13,792
-Beika! -Beika!

270
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:16,092
In other words, Beikacho.

271
00:14:16,092 --> 00:14:17,292
A play on words?

272
00:14:17,292 --> 00:14:18,837
Well, if you get to the bottom of things

273
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:21,092
codes are similar to a play on words too.

274
00:14:21,092 --> 00:14:22,192
If they're paper planes

275
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:25,392
the President Shirota who was kidnapped and confined flew,

276
00:14:25,392 --> 00:14:28,847
so long as the kidnapper can't make out the message,

277
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:31,492
whether it's a play on words or whatever, it really doesn't matter, does it?

278
00:14:31,492 --> 00:14:34,853
Then, where is President Shirota?

279
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:36,592
If I remember correctly, the first paper plane

280
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:37,992
sent out the message SOS.

281
00:14:37,992 --> 00:14:38,857
The next message was,

282
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:42,092
"A place where cell phones are outside of service range."

283
00:14:42,092 --> 00:14:43,292
If we connect all three messages it would come out to,

284
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:46,865
"Help me, I'm confined in a place in Beikacho

285
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:49,392
where cell phones are out of service range."

286
00:14:49,392 --> 00:14:53,292
I wonder if there's a place like that in Beikacho, besides a basement.

287
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,873
A tall building.

288
00:14:55,992 --> 00:14:58,492
The base station antenna for cell phones

289
00:14:58,492 --> 00:15:02,192
is faced towards the ground where the inlet density is high,

290
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:05,692
so if you're anywhere higher than that, it's hard to connect.

291
00:15:05,692 --> 00:15:06,885
Even if connection is successful,

292
00:15:07,092 --> 00:15:08,192
because of its height,

293
00:15:08,192 --> 00:15:10,592
it'll pick up multiple radio waves from the base station

294
00:15:10,592 --> 00:15:12,292
and roaming will frequently occur,

295
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:14,893
resulting in out of service range.

296
00:15:15,092 --> 00:15:18,692
There are two tall buildings in Beikacho,

297
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:21,392
but it would be difficult to confine a person in a place

298
00:15:21,392 --> 00:15:23,792
where people go in and out to make the beds.

299
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,292
Therefore,

300
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:29,692
President Shirota is most likely confined in the Beika Tower Condominium.

301
00:15:29,692 --> 00:15:32,192
No, that's pretty close from here!

302
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:34,092
Well, the out of service range was probably indicated

303
00:15:34,092 --> 00:15:36,392
just to make locating the place he is confined easier,

304
00:15:36,392 --> 00:15:37,892
because I'm pretty sure

305
00:15:37,892 --> 00:15:40,692
that the kidnapper took his cell phone away from him already.

306
00:15:40,692 --> 00:15:43,592
We'd better notify the police ASAP about this.

307
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:46,392
Telephone?

308
00:15:48,492 --> 00:15:50,292
Ran, it's me!

309
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:51,492
Shinichi!

310
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,392
Where are you now?

311
00:15:53,392 --> 00:15:54,933
Still at your house.

312
00:15:55,092 --> 00:15:56,192
All the better.

313
00:15:56,192 --> 00:15:59,292
Go to the Beika Tower Condominium nearby!

314
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:03,592
That's where President Shirota who was kidnapped is confined.

315
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:05,892
That means that you solved the mystery of the paper planes?

316
00:16:05,892 --> 00:16:08,592
Yeah, but I'll explain later.

317
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,092
The desk in my room.

318
00:16:10,092 --> 00:16:12,592
In the second drawer, you'll find binoculars!

319
00:16:12,592 --> 00:16:15,992
Take that and ride the observatory elevator of the Beika Hotel.

320
00:16:15,992 --> 00:16:17,892
Have Sonoko call the police

321
00:16:17,892 --> 00:16:18,957
and go there right away!

322
00:16:20,492 --> 00:16:23,492
I wanted to go with Ran too.

323
00:16:23,492 --> 00:16:27,392
Well, let's let the he and she take care of the site.

324
00:16:27,392 --> 00:16:28,967
He?

325
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:33,892
Kinichi, was it? The one who likes to make deductions.

326
00:16:48,392 --> 00:16:52,592
But Shinichi, from here I can only see one side of the condo.

327
00:16:52,592 --> 00:16:55,992
Yeah, if he's on the side that you can't see, it'll be a waste,

328
00:16:55,992 --> 00:16:57,492
but it's better than not even giving it a try!

329
00:17:13,392 --> 00:17:15,013
-Did you find it? -Yes.

330
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:18,192
The room to the very right on the east side of the 36th floor!

331
00:17:18,192 --> 00:17:19,492
The window is slightly opened

332
00:17:19,492 --> 00:17:21,792
and there are many paper planes on the veranda.

333
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:24,192
Ran! Just because you found the place he's being confined,

334
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:25,792
don't go barging in there on your own, now!

335
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:27,492
Although the likelihood is close to nil,

336
00:17:27,492 --> 00:17:30,592
an accomplice of the kidnapper may still be there!

337
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:35,392
Yep. I'll e-mail Sonoko who's at the police about this and...

338
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,792
What's up, Ran?

339
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:42,292
Oh, no.

340
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:44,792
The paper plane that just came flying

341
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:46,792
is folded with a 10,000 yen bill.

342
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:47,992
What?

343
00:17:47,992 --> 00:17:49,392
There's nothing drawn on it,

344
00:17:49,392 --> 00:17:51,049
but I wonder if this is President Shirota's paper plane too?

345
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:53,051
Yeah, most likely!

346
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:55,053
Even if nothing is drawn on it, if money comes flying,

347
00:17:55,292 --> 00:17:57,692
everyone would go nuts and search where it's flying from

348
00:17:57,692 --> 00:17:59,392
and the police would surely be notified.

349
00:17:59,392 --> 00:18:00,592
That's what he's after.

350
00:18:00,592 --> 00:18:03,061
But flying something like this in broad daylight

351
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:04,692
would be taking the risk of the kidnapper finding it out,

352
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:07,065
means President Shirota is taking a sink or swim chance!

353
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:11,069
In other words, it means that President Shirota is in pretty bad condition.

354
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:13,071
The first time the paper plane was found

355
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:14,492
was the morning the day before yesterday,

356
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:15,492
so it's already been more than three days

357
00:18:15,492 --> 00:18:17,492
since he first started flying the paper planes.

358
00:18:17,492 --> 00:18:19,592
Moreover, the kidnapper committed suicide.

359
00:18:19,592 --> 00:18:23,092
If he's being left as is and give no food or water,

360
00:18:23,092 --> 00:18:26,392
he could be on the verge of starvation or be extremely dehydrated.

361
00:18:26,392 --> 00:18:29,087
I'll call the police and ambulance,

362
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:30,192
so you wait there, Ran.

363
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,091
What would you do, Shinichi?

364
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:35,992
You wouldn't wait in times like this, would you, Shinichi?

365
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:39,092
I'm going!

366
00:18:39,092 --> 00:18:40,092
Wait!

367
00:18:40,092 --> 00:18:42,592
I told you there's a possibility that the kidnapper's accomplice is there.

368
00:18:42,592 --> 00:18:45,592
But you did say that the possibility is close to zero, right?

369
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,392
I know that if it were you, you would dash right in there

370
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,107
and rescue the man.

371
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:52,392
Tell me how to do it, Shinichi!

372
00:18:52,392 --> 00:18:54,092
Shinichi!

373
00:18:57,292 --> 00:18:59,392
I'm Yamakawa from TMS Insurance.

374
00:18:59,392 --> 00:19:00,392
Please come in!

375
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:12,892
Yes? Who is it?

376
00:19:12,892 --> 00:19:16,292
I was riding the elevator of the hotel on the opposite side just now

377
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:17,135
and happened to see

378
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:19,692
a suspicious looking figure of a person on the veranda here!

379
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:22,392
Please call the police right away!

380
00:19:22,392 --> 00:19:23,141
Yes!

381
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:27,792
There it is!

382
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:32,592
By law, all skyscrapers must be equipped with emergency exit ladders.

383
00:19:32,592 --> 00:19:34,492
Use the ladder from the room right above his room.

384
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:48,292
Who are you?

385
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:50,592
You're President Shirota that was kidnapped, aren't you?

386
00:19:50,592 --> 00:19:53,492
I saw your paper planes and came to help you.

387
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:56,692
When you get there, first lay him down sideways,

388
00:19:56,692 --> 00:19:58,192
and of course don't forget the pillow.

389
00:19:58,192 --> 00:20:02,192
Then dampen a handkerchief with tap water and place it against his mouth.

390
00:20:02,192 --> 00:20:04,592
That's the best emergency aid you can give him.

391
00:20:06,192 --> 00:20:07,892
The ransom.

392
00:20:07,892 --> 00:20:09,792
Was it given to him?

393
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:10,792
Don't worry.

394
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,892
Everything's been solved, so please rest assured.

395
00:20:13,892 --> 00:20:15,692
Oh, no. Don't tell me that there's an accomplice after all?

396
00:20:19,492 --> 00:20:20,992
I'm...

397
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:28,792
Okay, we'll take over from here.

398
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:30,492
We were told about you.

399
00:20:30,492 --> 00:20:33,211
-You're Ms. Ran Mouri, aren't you? -Yes.

400
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:36,292
Is the one who called us your boyfriend?

401
00:20:36,292 --> 00:20:38,292
Oh, no. It's nothing like that.

402
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:40,592
Can you relay a message to him?

403
00:20:40,592 --> 00:20:43,492
He needs to state briefly and clearly what the situation is.

404
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,592
I understand that he is panicky

405
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:49,492
but just yelling isn't do anyone any good.

406
00:20:49,492 --> 00:20:53,231
Well, we really did get the message that he was desperate, though.

407
00:20:56,092 --> 00:20:59,237
The room turned out to be the room of the kidnapper himself,

408
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:00,992
and he had no accomplice.

409
00:21:00,992 --> 00:21:03,792
He committed crime because he had debts.

410
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:05,692
President Shirota, who had been confined,

411
00:21:05,692 --> 00:21:07,245
recovered with no complications,

412
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:10,492
and the queer paper plane case was closed.

413
00:21:13,892 --> 00:21:16,892
That Shinichi panicked and yelled his head off

414
00:21:16,892 --> 00:21:19,992
at the paramedics and police officer?

415
00:21:19,992 --> 00:21:22,692
He was so calm when he was telling me what to do.

416
00:21:22,692 --> 00:21:24,592
It's not like him, is it?

417
00:21:24,592 --> 00:21:27,265
Well, that's because he was worried about his beloved wife

418
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:28,592
being in a pinch.

419
00:21:28,592 --> 00:21:30,192
It can't be,

420
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:32,592
he's not that kind of character that guy.

421
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:35,692
I mean, I'm not his wife.

422
00:21:35,692 --> 00:21:38,792
Well, to be honest, it could have been.

423
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:41,692
I honestly don't remember what I said back then.

424
00:21:41,692 --> 00:21:44,792
I was all heated up

425
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:47,692
and I just had one thing in mind.

426
00:21:47,692 --> 00:21:52,992
That I had to protect the tomboy rescuer over my dead body.

427
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:23,792
Come to think of it,

428
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:27,892
I wonder who won the deduction match, Subaru or Shinichi?

429
00:23:27,892 --> 00:23:28,992
Beats me.

430
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:30,292
Deduction match?

431
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:33,391
Well, President Shirota was safely rescued,

432
00:23:33,391 --> 00:23:36,992
so I'm sure Subaru must be toasting in celebration now.

433
00:23:36,992 --> 00:23:38,592
Toast in celebration?

434
00:23:38,592 --> 00:23:40,892
I found on the kitchen shelf

435
00:23:40,892 --> 00:23:44,492
a bottle of liquor that I didn't see before when I went to clean the house.

436
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

437
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,423
"Bluebird".

438
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,602
Where on earth is my bluebird of happiness?

439
00:24:08,602 --> 00:24:09,790
Sonoko, look over there.

440
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,060
Oh, it flew off.
