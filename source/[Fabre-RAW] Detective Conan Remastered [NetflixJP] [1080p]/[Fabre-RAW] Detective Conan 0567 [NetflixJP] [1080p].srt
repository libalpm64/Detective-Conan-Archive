1
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:09,294
I'm tired.

2
00:00:09,294 --> 00:00:11,994
What? Outdoor Spa?

3
00:00:11,994 --> 00:00:13,993
Looks like fun to me.

4
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:16,594
Let's give it a try.

5
00:00:20,494 --> 00:00:22,394
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

6
00:00:22,394 --> 00:00:24,494
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

7
00:00:24,494 --> 00:00:26,005
What is the alibi trick that was used?

8
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:27,994
Taking advantage of the blind-spot?

9
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:30,009
He sees through the one and only truth.

10
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:32,011
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

11
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:34,394
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

12
00:02:15,182 --> 00:02:20,982
"Murderous Intent Raining on an Outdoor Spa"

13
00:02:25,182 --> 00:02:26,782
There's no use in stalling!

14
00:02:26,782 --> 00:02:28,782
"Hideaki Umezu (70)" -Why don't you just hurry up

15
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,129
"Mortgage Company President" -and sign this contract?

16
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:32,131
"Kouichi Maekawa (50)" -I told you many times

17
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:34,133
"Hot Springs Park Manager" -that I have no desire to sell this place!

18
00:02:35,082 --> 00:02:36,782
What an incapable successor!

19
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,982
You seriously think you can gather customers

20
00:02:38,982 --> 00:02:40,139
by selling octopuses here?

21
00:02:40,382 --> 00:02:43,482
It's because of a certain gargoyle perching over my place

22
00:02:43,482 --> 00:02:45,582
that the customers are being driven away.

23
00:02:48,982 --> 00:02:51,182
Welcome.

24
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:54,153
Be prepared to be disappointed by like this lousy hot spring.

25
00:02:54,153 --> 00:02:55,882
-What? -Why?

26
00:02:55,882 --> 00:02:59,182
-Now... -It's all right, just ignore him.

27
00:02:59,182 --> 00:03:01,082
"Mari Ehara (35)" -This happens all the time,

28
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:02,161
"Hideaki's First Daughter" -so don't mind him.

29
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:03,382
"Yasuko Umeza (28)" -That's right.

30
00:03:03,382 --> 00:03:06,682
"Hideaki's Second Daughter" -My dad always here to pick fights.

31
00:03:06,682 --> 00:03:09,482
Enough of that! You're all grown up yet all,

32
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:11,882
you can do is mooch off of me.

33
00:03:11,882 --> 00:03:14,173
I'll have you know that you're to be quiet and respect my decisions.

34
00:03:14,382 --> 00:03:16,175
Ouch!

35

"Shousuke Yagihashi (27)" -The reason our president comes

36
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:22,182
"Hideaki's Secretary" -to this place is for business.

37
00:03:23,182 --> 00:03:24,482
You got that right.

38
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:27,282
-Let's head inside! -Yes, sir.

39
00:03:29,282 --> 00:03:33,782
He says we'll be disappointed? Yet he goes in anyway.

40
00:03:33,782 --> 00:03:36,195
Two adults and one child.

41
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,197
I sincerely apologize

42
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:40,582
for embarrassing you with our fight earlier.

43
00:03:40,582 --> 00:03:42,982
Who's that guy pushing his weight around?

44
00:03:42,982 --> 00:03:45,382
He's the president from a mortgage company.

45
00:03:45,382 --> 00:03:50,209
Over the past month he's been frequenting our private spa.

46
00:03:50,382 --> 00:03:52,782
Business harassment.

47
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:58,217
We're going to prepare some freshly caught octopuses.

48
00:03:58,217 --> 00:04:00,882
So please come to our restaurant after your baths.

49
00:04:00,882 --> 00:04:02,982
Looks tasty!

50
00:04:03,982 --> 00:04:06,982
All right, spa first and octopus later.

51
00:04:06,982 --> 00:04:09,082
Looks like we're starting to run low on octopuses,

52
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,982
so I'll go to the coast and catch some.

53
00:04:10,982 --> 00:04:11,982
I'll leave this place to you.

54
00:04:11,982 --> 00:04:15,182
Huh? But low tide is at 8:02 pm today.

55
00:04:15,182 --> 00:04:19,082
One hour earlier won't make a difference.

56
00:04:22,882 --> 00:04:26,682
Amazing! Look at all the variety of baths.

57
00:04:26,682 --> 00:04:30,582
I can't decide.

58
00:04:30,582 --> 00:04:33,582
Let's check out the iron tub first!

59
00:04:36,255 --> 00:04:38,882
Such a nice bath!

60
00:04:38,882 --> 00:04:41,882
Ran, the heat's starting to get to me.

61
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:44,263
Huh? Already?

62
00:04:46,265 --> 00:04:49,882
Hey, is it all right for you to get in the spa even when you're injured?

63
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:53,982
No, that's why I'll only take a light dip in the Jacuzzi.

64
00:04:53,982 --> 00:04:56,275
I can't wring a towel while I'm like this after all.

65
00:04:59,282 --> 00:05:03,082
Conan, this spa is fabulous.

66
00:05:03,082 --> 00:05:05,082
My body's floating on the water.

67
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:08,287
I... I'm heading out now.

68
00:05:08,482 --> 00:05:10,289
Weird child.

69
00:05:13,882 --> 00:05:16,295
Wasn't she...

70
00:05:23,582 --> 00:05:25,482
So good.

71
00:05:25,482 --> 00:05:30,309
Drinking beer again, aren't you going to driving later?

72
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:35,382
No need to worry. I've decided that we'll stay at a nearby hotel tonight.

73
00:05:35,382 --> 00:05:38,882
That was actually your plan all along, wasn't it?

74
00:05:38,882 --> 00:05:41,682
No, the octopus suckers are getting on me.

75
00:05:41,682 --> 00:05:44,323
The arms will move even after they're cut off.

76
00:05:44,482 --> 00:05:45,782
Aren't they fresh?

77
00:05:45,782 --> 00:05:48,327
I used a harpoon to capture these during low tide.

78
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:52,082
But at other times, I use octopus pots or long-lines to trap them.

79
00:05:52,082 --> 00:05:55,182
How do you figure out where to place the pots and long-lines?

80
00:05:55,182 --> 00:05:57,782
I float a buoy to mark the spot.

81
00:05:57,782 --> 00:06:01,282
Do other people around here fish for octopuses too?

82
00:06:01,282 --> 00:06:04,343
Just me, since I'm specially trained as a fisherman.

83
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:05,682
But I only did when I felt like it.

84
00:06:05,682 --> 00:06:08,347
And my dad suddenly died a year ago,

85
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:11,182
so I've become this place's manager on short notice.

86
00:06:13,482 --> 00:06:15,082
What was that sound?

87
00:06:15,082 --> 00:06:18,357
It was probably from the private outdoor spa.

88
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:22,361
Hey! Go check out the private outdoor spa.

89
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:23,682
Sure!

90
00:06:44,082 --> 00:06:45,782
President...

91
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:47,482
Dad...

92
00:06:47,482 --> 00:06:49,182
No way.

93
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:52,882
It's no use, he's already stopped breathing.

94
00:06:52,882 --> 00:06:55,082
Please call the police and an ambulance!

95
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,382
Ah, right!

96
00:07:05,982 --> 00:07:08,082
The deceased is mortgage company president,

97
00:07:08,082 --> 00:07:13,982
Hideaki Umezu is frequented this private outdoor spa every night, right?

98
00:07:13,982 --> 00:07:15,482
That's right.

99
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:19,582
You found him bleeding from his head and sitting in the spa?

100
00:07:19,582 --> 00:07:21,282
It was at exactly 8:00.

101
00:07:21,282 --> 00:07:25,382
A loud tumbling and splashing sound came from this outdoor spa.

102
00:07:25,382 --> 00:07:28,182
A rock on the cliff was close to tumbling off,

103
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:30,682
and I was about to schedule a maintenance appointment.

104
00:07:30,682 --> 00:07:33,382
Safety management is a great responsibility, you know!

105
00:07:33,382 --> 00:07:35,582
I'm truly sorry.

106
00:07:35,582 --> 00:07:39,082
So this was an accident. The rock fell from that cliff

107
00:07:39,082 --> 00:07:41,782
and hit Mr. Umezu's head.

108
00:07:41,782 --> 00:07:44,443
Hey, retrieve that rock immediately!

109
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:45,982
Yes, sir!

110
00:07:48,082 --> 00:07:51,082
Ah, let me help too.

111
00:07:51,082 --> 00:07:53,182
We don't require your help.

112
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:56,182
Oh, I see.

113
00:07:57,482 --> 00:08:00,082
This rock is covered in quite a bit of moss.

114
00:08:00,082 --> 00:08:02,982
Bloodstains and hair are attached on it.

115
00:08:10,882 --> 00:08:14,082
Looks like the rock broke off and fell from here.

116
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:16,475
Hey, there are friction marks

117
00:08:16,682 --> 00:08:18,782
on the nearby rocks around that hole.

118
00:08:18,782 --> 00:08:21,582
What? This is...

119
00:08:21,582 --> 00:08:24,483
Don't tell me someone tried to force the rock out.

120
00:08:24,682 --> 00:08:27,582
And caused the scratch marks by wiggling the rock around?

121
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:28,487
In other words,

122
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:32,491
the rock didn't naturally fall off the cliff and hit Mr. Umezu.

123
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:34,982
Rather, someone stood on top of the cliff

124
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:38,497
and threw the rock directly at Mr. Umezu.

125
00:08:38,497 --> 00:08:40,982
This is not an accident, but a murder!

126
00:08:40,982 --> 00:08:45,082
But, we did hear sounds resembling a rock rolling down the cliff.

127
00:08:45,082 --> 00:08:47,182
Since the rock was heavy, the culprit rolled it over the edge.

128
00:08:47,182 --> 00:08:49,082
I see.

129
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:57,882
At this height, it was impossible for anyone to enter from the outside.

130
00:08:57,882 --> 00:09:01,582
In that case, the only passage to get here is from that glass door.

131
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,182
A crime committed by someone

132
00:09:03,182 --> 00:09:04,982
from this hot springs park at 8:00,

133
00:09:04,982 --> 00:09:07,182
so it seems...

134
00:09:07,182 --> 00:09:10,782
All right, everyone gather in the lobby!

135
00:09:15,782 --> 00:09:17,382
I'll bring some tea here.

136
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:18,882
Watch out!

137
00:09:21,682 --> 00:09:23,982
Hey, you! Where were you looking?

138
00:09:23,982 --> 00:09:26,545
I'm terribly sorry!

139
00:09:29,482 --> 00:09:31,482
My apologies.

140
00:09:31,482 --> 00:09:33,482
I can't believe that.

141
00:09:33,482 --> 00:09:37,282
Mr. Maekawa, there's no need for tea, so please come here.

142
00:09:37,282 --> 00:09:40,559
All right.

143
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,582
What do you want to talk to us about?

144
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:47,282
Mr. Umezu was apparently murdered by someone!

145
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:50,182
During the estimated time of death around 8:00 pm.

146
00:09:50,182 --> 00:09:52,982
The relevant parties in the spas

147
00:09:52,982 --> 00:09:55,082
of this hot springs park were you three people!

148
00:09:55,082 --> 00:09:57,182
I would like to ask what you were doing

149
00:09:57,182 --> 00:09:59,582
and your whereabouts during that time.

150
00:09:59,582 --> 00:10:00,882
Nonsense!

151
00:10:00,882 --> 00:10:03,882
Don't tell me that you're suspecting us?

152
00:10:03,882 --> 00:10:06,585
First, I'll question the person who met with Mr. Umezu last,

153
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:09,682
Secretary Yagihashi, if you please!

154
00:10:09,682 --> 00:10:12,182
Yes, at around 7:00,

155
00:10:12,182 --> 00:10:15,582
I was helping the president get changed in the locker room.

156
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:17,082
After I sent the president off,

157
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:19,882
I received a call from work and I returned to the spa

158
00:10:19,882 --> 00:10:24,603
about 5 minutes after Mr. Mouri and the others.

159
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:26,605
Where were you at around 8:00?

160
00:10:26,782 --> 00:10:31,182
I was taking a shower. After that I heard the commotion.

161
00:10:33,782 --> 00:10:37,482
Well, it's only a short distance from the showers to the crime scene.

162
00:10:37,482 --> 00:10:39,182
No way!

163
00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:41,082
And the eldest daughter, Mari?

164
00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:45,682
I entered the spa some time after the detective's daughter did.

165
00:10:45,682 --> 00:10:47,782
And once there, I was in the Jacuzzi the whole time.

166
00:10:47,782 --> 00:10:50,629
Here, you can smell the jasmine from my hair, can you?

167
00:10:50,782 --> 00:10:52,631
Jasmine?

168
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:56,082
In order to enhance the healing effects of our Jacuzzi,

169
00:10:56,082 --> 00:10:58,382
we supplement it with herbs.

170
00:10:58,382 --> 00:11:00,639
Ran, is that correct?

171
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,682
Yes.

172
00:11:01,682 --> 00:11:06,645
I went in the spa earlier than both Mari and Yasuko.

173
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:11,082
The Jacuzzi is right next to the private outdoor spa, too.

174
00:11:11,082 --> 00:11:14,282
Looks like Mari had an opportunity to commit the crime as well!

175
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:16,282
Stop blurting out nonsense!

176
00:11:16,282 --> 00:11:18,082
And the younger daughter, Yasuko?

177
00:11:18,082 --> 00:11:21,182
I was talking to a friend on the phone,

178
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:25,382
so I got in the spa about five minutes later than my sister did.

179
00:11:25,382 --> 00:11:27,882
I was at the reclining spa in the far back.

180
00:11:27,882 --> 00:11:31,082
But sometime before 8:00,

181
00:11:31,082 --> 00:11:35,382
I saw Yasuko headed for the mist sauna.

182
00:11:35,382 --> 00:11:37,782
Mr. Yagihashi was there too.

183
00:11:38,882 --> 00:11:41,882
Oh, my. What were you two doing in the mist?

184
00:11:41,882 --> 00:11:44,982
We happened to bump into each other at the sauna!

185
00:11:44,982 --> 00:11:48,682
And officer, you forgot about the most suspicious party.

186
00:11:48,682 --> 00:11:51,982
Our president was about to buyout this hot springs park.

187
00:11:51,982 --> 00:11:55,282
Couldn't the manager, Maekawa have held a grudge over this?

188
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,982
The female staff member was confirmed

189
00:11:57,982 --> 00:12:00,282
to be at the front desk by the security camera,

190
00:12:00,282 --> 00:12:02,482
But Mr. Maekawa, you were not present at all times.

191
00:12:02,482 --> 00:12:05,282
Well, since we were running low on octopuses,

192
00:12:05,282 --> 00:12:08,482
I went out to catch some at sea around 7:00.

193
00:12:08,482 --> 00:12:11,482
From 7:30 to 8:00 I was in the restaurant,

194
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:13,682
and Mr. Mouri can attest to that.

195
00:12:13,682 --> 00:12:15,082
Is that true?

196
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:20,719
Yeah, Mr. Maekawa was with me in the restaurant the whole time.

197
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:23,382
I see.

198
00:12:23,382 --> 00:12:27,082
To recap of the four people relating to Mr. Umezu,

199
00:12:27,082 --> 00:12:29,982
all of you except Mr. Maekawa, were in the hot springs park.

200
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,731
And had the opportunity to murder him.

201
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:34,733
The older daughter, Mari, was at the Jacuzzi.

202
00:12:34,982 --> 00:12:37,182
The younger daughter, Yasuko was at the reclining spa.

203
00:12:37,182 --> 00:12:39,582
And the secretary Yagihashi was in the showers.

204
00:12:39,582 --> 00:12:42,182
These two have motives, as well.

205
00:12:42,182 --> 00:12:45,282
Father was fiercely opposed to the two of them getting married!

206
00:12:45,282 --> 00:12:47,982
If you're trying to incriminate us,

207
00:12:47,982 --> 00:12:49,982
you'd also be one to benefit from this!

208
00:12:49,982 --> 00:12:51,282
How dare you!

209
00:12:51,282 --> 00:12:55,182
After all, your business did poorly and you're in debt now, aren't you?

210
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:58,757
You sunk your claws into dad's assets in order to pay it off, didn't you?

211
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:02,282
Don't just go saying whatever you please!

212
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,182
Regardless, is it true that you merely

213
00:13:05,182 --> 00:13:08,282
"happened" to run into Yasuko at the sauna?

214
00:13:08,282 --> 00:13:10,382
That is...

215
00:13:10,382 --> 00:13:12,771
I called him there.

216
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:14,082
Yasuko!

217
00:13:14,082 --> 00:13:16,775
I figured since dad opposed our marriage,

218
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:20,082
we had no choice but to elope.

219
00:13:20,082 --> 00:13:24,482
We had planned to do just that after this park was bought out.

220
00:13:24,482 --> 00:13:26,582
You're just spitting a bunch of rubbish out of your mouth.

221
00:13:26,582 --> 00:13:30,282
Officer, don't be fooled by this man's words!

222
00:13:30,282 --> 00:13:32,082
Because of his attempt to marry Yasuko,

223
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:35,482
father angrily told him to learn his place!

224
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,797
That's why he held a grudge. You ungrateful goon!

225
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:49,482
This is...

226
00:13:49,482 --> 00:13:50,809
I see.

227
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:53,682
Mr. Mouri, did you figure out who did it?

228
00:13:53,682 --> 00:13:55,882
Yeah, I got it.

229
00:13:55,882 --> 00:13:59,282
I bet that the culprit didn't want to leave their fingerprints behind.

230
00:13:59,282 --> 00:14:01,582
So they used a towel to wrap around the rock

231
00:14:01,582 --> 00:14:04,482
before throwing it at Mr. Umezu.

232
00:14:04,482 --> 00:14:10,182
In that case, the towel should have moss that rubbed off the rock.

233
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,582
You can see the smudges here, can't you?

234
00:14:13,582 --> 00:14:15,982
Could it be that towel...

235
00:14:15,982 --> 00:14:17,582
I don't know anything about it.

236
00:14:17,582 --> 00:14:20,382
Why was something like that inside my bag?

237
00:14:20,382 --> 00:14:23,682
Mari, it won't do you any good to say and talk your way out of this.

238
00:14:23,682 --> 00:14:27,182
We'll find out for ourselves after having this towel explained.

239
00:14:27,182 --> 00:14:28,382
Now, everyone,

240
00:14:28,382 --> 00:14:30,849
I'll explain everything in detail.

241
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:32,851
Please, come to the private outdoor spa!

242
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:35,882
As expected of Mr. Mouri!

243
00:14:37,482 --> 00:14:39,982
No good, at this rate...

244
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:43,382
Ran, what's up?

245
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,282
Well, I was just wondering

246
00:14:45,282 --> 00:14:48,882
why I was able to stay on top of the water in the float spa.

247
00:14:48,882 --> 00:14:50,869
That's easy.

248
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:54,182
Like the Dead Sea, it contains a high concentration of salt

249
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:56,182
which makes you float.

250
00:14:56,182 --> 00:14:58,382
Float?

251
00:14:58,382 --> 00:15:00,282
Don't tell me...

252
00:15:00,282 --> 00:15:02,382
Wait, Conan!

253
00:15:09,882 --> 00:15:11,682
Found it!

254
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:16,682
This is it.

255
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:20,282
Now I've figured out the trick that the culprit used!

256
00:15:29,077 --> 00:15:33,477
Conan! You're always running off at the drop of a hat.

257
00:15:33,477 --> 00:15:35,377
Ah, sorry.

258
00:15:35,377 --> 00:15:39,177
Actually, Pops asked me to do something...

259
00:15:41,677 --> 00:15:42,921
Got it!

260
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:46,177
All right, let's get things started!

261
00:15:46,177 --> 00:15:49,677
The reason I named Mari as the culprt it was...

262
00:15:54,477 --> 00:15:56,935
Just for laughs!

263
00:15:56,935 --> 00:16:00,077
Mr. Mouri, this is no time for jokes!

264
00:16:00,077 --> 00:16:02,177
Well, quiet down and listen!

265
00:16:02,177 --> 00:16:05,877
Mari, your right hand is injured, isn't it?

266
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:08,677
Yeah...

267
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:12,477
With a wound like that,

268
00:16:12,477 --> 00:16:14,677
it would be difficult to tightly wring a towel.

269
00:16:14,677 --> 00:16:16,977
Wring tightly...

270
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:20,377
But that towel was tightly wrung!

271
00:16:20,377 --> 00:16:21,377
That's right.

272
00:16:21,377 --> 00:16:25,877
In other words, that towel did not belong to Mari.

273
00:16:25,877 --> 00:16:29,577
However, the towel did come out of her bag.

274
00:16:29,577 --> 00:16:34,377
The culprit put it there. In order to place the blame on Mari!

275
00:16:34,377 --> 00:16:36,277
What was that?

276
00:16:36,277 --> 00:16:39,477
However, it ended up exposing him.

277
00:16:39,477 --> 00:16:42,977
He didn't think deep enough about Mari's wound.

278
00:16:42,977 --> 00:16:44,977
So, how did the culprit do it?

279
00:16:44,977 --> 00:16:46,985
The only one who was able to put the towel in the bag

280
00:16:47,177 --> 00:16:50,377
that Mari carried all along is...

281
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:52,377
I'm terribly sorry.

282
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:57,777
Mr. Maekawa, it was you.

283
00:16:57,777 --> 00:17:00,177
But Mr. Mouri, at the time of the crime,

284
00:17:00,177 --> 00:17:03,477
Mr. Maekawa has an alibi of being with you.

285
00:17:03,477 --> 00:17:06,677
Mr. Umezu's fingernails were ragged and dirty.

286
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:13,011
It's possible that Mr. Umezu didn't die after being hit by the rock.

287
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:17,477
But from having his head forced under the water. And being drowned.

288
00:17:17,477 --> 00:17:20,677
The reason why Mr. Umezu's fingernails were ragged and dirty

289
00:17:20,677 --> 00:17:24,377
was because he was struggling and scratching at the bottom of the spa.

290
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,977
Verify this with forensics!

291
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:27,025
Yes, sir!

292
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:32,377
However, we rushed here soon after we heard the noise made by the rock.

293
00:17:32,377 --> 00:17:35,977
It's impossible to drawn a person in such a short time.

294
00:17:35,977 --> 00:17:38,377
Then, when was Mr. Umezu drowned?

295
00:17:38,377 --> 00:17:41,677
Look at the disposable shampoo and soap.

296
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:43,577
None of them were used.

297
00:17:43,577 --> 00:17:45,577
The seats weren't used either.

298
00:17:46,577 --> 00:17:49,047
You're right! They weren't used at all.

299
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:53,977
In other words, Mr. Umezu was killed as soon as he entered the spa!

300
00:17:53,977 --> 00:17:56,177
What? Around 7:00?

301
00:17:56,177 --> 00:17:57,977
Meanwhile, Mr. Yagihashi,

302
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:02,677
Yasuko and Mari were in the locker room.

303
00:18:02,677 --> 00:18:04,477
The only person capable of committing the crime

304
00:18:04,477 --> 00:18:07,065
was Mr. Maekawa.

305
00:18:07,277 --> 00:18:09,477
At that time you went to catch octopuses.

306
00:18:09,477 --> 00:18:12,777
Despite the fact that it was an hour too early for low tide.

307
00:18:14,477 --> 00:18:17,677
You actually didn't go to catch octopuses, didn't you?

308
00:18:17,677 --> 00:18:21,079
And without his suspecting anything,

309
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:24,677
you brained Mr. Umezu with the rock.

310
00:18:24,677 --> 00:18:28,477
Then, you forced his head under the water... Drowned him.

311
00:18:29,477 --> 00:18:31,089
What are you talking about?

312
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:35,877
You heard the noise at 8:00 as well, didn't you?

313
00:18:36,877 --> 00:18:39,097
Let's see, if the time of the crime was 7:00,

314
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:42,277
then who rolled the rock at 8:00?

315
00:18:42,277 --> 00:18:45,777
After all, Mr. Maekawa was in the restaurant at that time.

316
00:18:45,777 --> 00:18:47,877
He used a trick.

317
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,777
Conan, do what I just taught you!

318
00:18:50,777 --> 00:18:53,111
Right.

319
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:57,677
Inspector Yokomizo, carry that rock and climb up this cliff!

320
00:18:58,777 --> 00:19:00,777
Sure.

321
00:19:02,277 --> 00:19:04,377
This rock sure is heavy.

322
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:07,977
You can see a small harbor down there, right?

323
00:19:07,977 --> 00:19:10,477
-Oh, yes. -Ran!

324
00:19:10,477 --> 00:19:12,077
Here!

325
00:19:16,177 --> 00:19:19,777
This rope was tied to the buoy near the harbor.

326
00:19:19,777 --> 00:19:22,477
It's a type of rope called a long-line.

327
00:19:22,477 --> 00:19:24,477
Long-line?

328
00:19:25,677 --> 00:19:28,477
Grab the long-line and pull it straight.

329
00:19:28,477 --> 00:19:30,477
Next, tilt the rock just brought up

330
00:19:30,477 --> 00:19:32,377
forward at the edge of the cliff.

331
00:19:32,377 --> 00:19:35,477
Then use the wooden rod to support the rock.

332
00:19:35,477 --> 00:19:37,577
With this, we're all set.

333
00:19:41,877 --> 00:19:43,877
Ran!

334
00:19:43,877 --> 00:19:45,777
All right!

335
00:19:52,177 --> 00:19:54,377
What's this?

336
00:19:56,477 --> 00:20:00,977
The sea entered low tide at 8:00 and had the lowest water level.

337
00:20:00,977 --> 00:20:05,183
As such, the buoy floating in the sea went down as well.

338
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:06,777
The buoy pulled the line down,

339
00:20:06,777 --> 00:20:10,477
which removed the rod and caused the rock to fall.

340
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:14,277
In other words, he used low tide as his time difference trick.

341
00:20:14,277 --> 00:20:15,477
Low tide?

342
00:20:15,477 --> 00:20:18,177
The rope and rod that would've served as evidence

343
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:21,199
flew off the ledge and headed straight into the sea.

344
00:20:21,377 --> 00:20:23,201
It's true.

345
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:26,077
See the part of the ledge that has been clipped away?

346
00:20:26,077 --> 00:20:27,677
Oh, yes.

347
00:20:27,677 --> 00:20:32,377
Those friction marks were made by the hooks attached to the long-line.

348
00:20:32,377 --> 00:20:34,377
That was pretty telltale.

349
00:20:34,377 --> 00:20:37,777
I see, using this method...

350
00:20:37,777 --> 00:20:39,977
He could cause the rock to roll down at 8:00

351
00:20:39,977 --> 00:20:42,477
even if he were in a different place.

352
00:20:42,477 --> 00:20:44,277
It's an interesting deduction,

353
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:47,225
but that's all circumstantial evidence, isn't it?

354
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:49,227
Do you have any concrete evidence?

355
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:55,233
Mr. Maekawa, why have you kept your pants rolled up all the time?

356
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:57,235
Why don't you roll them down?

357
00:20:57,477 --> 00:20:58,777
What was that?

358
00:20:58,777 --> 00:21:00,477
You can't, right?

359
00:21:00,477 --> 00:21:02,977
When you brained Mr. Umezu with the rock,

360
00:21:02,977 --> 00:21:05,977
his blood splattered on your pants.

361
00:21:05,977 --> 00:21:09,977
You only noticed it after you saw forensics roll up his pants

362
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,277
to retrieve the rock from the spa.

363
00:21:12,277 --> 00:21:15,977
You then unconsciously glanced at your pants.

364
00:21:15,977 --> 00:21:18,977
And hurriedly rolled them up!

365
00:21:20,377 --> 00:21:23,261
The police had already started their investigation,

366
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:26,977
so you couldn't change them without raising suspicion.

367
00:21:30,277 --> 00:21:32,477
We now have decisive evidence.

368
00:21:32,477 --> 00:21:35,077
As I thought, you held a grudge against our president

369
00:21:35,077 --> 00:21:37,777
because he tried to buyout your hot springs park!

370
00:21:37,777 --> 00:21:39,777
It wasn't just that.

371
00:21:39,777 --> 00:21:44,177
A year ago, my father was driven to despair by his debts to Umezu

372
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:47,677
deliberately got drunk and ended up drowning in the spa.

373
00:21:47,677 --> 00:21:50,677
I followed my father's will and used his life insurance

374
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:54,677
to reconstruct this hot spring park and tried to regain prosperity.

375
00:21:54,677 --> 00:21:58,277
But after all, I'm a man of the sea.

376
00:21:58,277 --> 00:22:02,177
In the end, I couldn't do anything about Umezu's buyout,

377
00:22:02,177 --> 00:22:06,377
so I figured if he were going to rob me of the place,

378
00:22:06,377 --> 00:22:10,177
I'd think up a plan to just bury him

379
00:22:10,177 --> 00:22:12,877
with the entire hot spring park.

380
00:23:44,277 --> 00:23:47,677
His snoring is so load I can't sleep.

381
00:23:55,677 --> 00:23:58,477
Now I can't sleep at all!

382
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

383
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,423
"Monster Movie"

384
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:52,080
Out next episode is about the inspector's love story.

385
00:24:52,088 --> 00:24:53,788
What? Inspector Megame's love story?

386
00:24:53,788 --> 00:24:54,988
No, not him.
