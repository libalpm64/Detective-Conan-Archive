1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,940
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,940
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,940
The fragrance of murder and the blotches

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,140
of a love affair in a glass of wine.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,740
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,560
Yes, who is it?

9
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,160
It's Ran Mouri.

10
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,660
Okay. One moment.

11
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,760
What's up, Ran?

12
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,060
Yuki,

13
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,860
thanks for the books.

14
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,960
How did you like it?

15
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,160
Well. My heart was pounding excitedly from beginning to end.

16
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,460
So, you thought so, too?

17
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,460
"Yuki Kojima (20)" -You came all this way

18
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,160
just to return it to me?

19
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,960
Thank you.

20
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
No, well not really.

21
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,160
I was on my way to a restaurant with my father and family

22
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,360
so I just dropped by on the way.

23
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,360
Hello. Thank you for being nice to my daughter always.

24
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,260
No, I've done nothing. Thank you.

25
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,060
Hey, Kojima.

26
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,560
"Junji Togashi (22)" -Which plate should I put out?

27
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,960
Please wait.

28
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,960
Oh, that's right.

29
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,560
We're holding a birthday party for a friend now.

30
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,360
Why don't you all join us, Ran?

31
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,760
But...

32
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,560
Please do so by all means.

33
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,960
There are only going to be three of my university friends,

34
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,960
so you don't have to be hesitant.

35
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,960
Besides, being able to meet the renowned Detective Mouri

36
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,560
is a birthday present that can't be beaten.

37
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,760
Ran, if it's okay with you, right?

38
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,660
Dad!

39
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,860
I'll bet all you want to do is get free booze.

40

"Mystery of the Birthday Wine"

41
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,660
Yuki.

42
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,360
Where shall I put this?

43
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,360
Can you put it in the kitchen for now?

44
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,460
Okay.

45
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,560
Oh, my. Are you okay?

46
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,660
Yes, I'm fine.

47
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,160
I'm sorry. This chair is a little broken.

48
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,660
The chair that Keiko, the star of today sits on goes way inside, right?

49
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,060
Yes. And will you put your bag in the kitchen?

50
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,960
It's kind of in the way here.

51
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,160
Okay, right away, madam.

52
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,760
Are you really okay?

53
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,160
You're not hurt, are you?

54
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,360
Yes, I'm fine.

55
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,260
Yuki, is there anything else you'd like me to do?

56
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,960
No, I guess that's it.

57
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,460
I'm sorry to have made you help me.

58
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,160
No problem at all.

59
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,060
That chair's broken, Togashi.

60
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,060
No problem, because I'll sit in it.

61
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,360
-It's Keiko and the others. -Yes.

62
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,460
Coming!

63
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,060
"Keiko Sawaguchi(20)" -Good evening.

64
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,160
We've been waiting for you, Keiko.

65
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,760
Hello.

66
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,960
-Hi, thanks for coming. -Hi there, you're late.

67
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,760
Sorry, the roads were jammed.

68
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,560
Keiko, I'll go park the car then.

69
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,860
Okay.

70
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,560
Keiko, has the day you're going abroad as an exchange student been decided?

71
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,660
I'm leaving next week Tuesday.

72
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,760
So, I'm sort of busy with this and that.

73
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,960
You mean, you're leaving that soon?

74
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,960
Mr. Mouri, please move a bit more to the left.

75
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,360
You mean like so?

76
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,360
Yes, okay. Here goes. One plus two is...

77
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,660
Three...

78
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,860
I'm so happy to be able to take a snapshot

79
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,660
with the renowned Detective Kogoro Mouri.

80
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,360
Huh? The glass cups are already out here.

81
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,060
Yes. Nonaka, will you get the thing out?

82
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,360
"Kasuki Nonaka (22)" -Huh? Oh, right.

83
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,960
This is my gift to you!

84
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,960
I bought it when I went to Germany some time ago.

85
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,860
Just for your birthday.

86
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,560
It wasn't cheap, you know.

87
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,560
Thanks so much!

88
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,560
Hey, I dished out my half for it too, you know.

89
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,660
Oh, you did?

90
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,760
First, for the birthday girl.

91
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,160
Thank you.

92
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,460
I hope you like it.

93
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,760
Thank you.

94
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,360
Nice color.

95
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,260
Hey, Nonaka, leave some for me, too.

96
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,360
Shoots, there's still some more left.

97
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,860
Here you go.

98
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,560
Like they say, "Save the best for last".

99
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,660
Just enough.

100
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,460
Here's a toast to our dear friend,

101
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,260
Keiko Sawaguchi's 20th birthday,

102
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,360
as well as her study trip abroad to the States.

103
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
Cheers!

104
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,960
Cheers...

105
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,360
Thank you!

106
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,460
It's delicious.

107
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,060
Really. It's so refreshing.

108
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,760
This is really good!

109
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,760
Everybody, please don't forget

110
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,960
I dished out half the cash.

111
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,160
Just what do you think you're doing, Togashi?

112
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,460
Sorry, sorry!

113
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,260
I'd completely forgotten about this chair.

114
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,560
Keiko, it didn't spill on your clothes, did it?

115
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,860
I think I'm fine.

116
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,360
I spilt the wine of the birthday girl.

117
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,160
The bottle's already empty too,

118
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,960
so if you want my drink, you can have it.

119
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,360
Go ahead and pass it around.

120
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,060
-Nonaka. -Yes.

121
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,960
I tell you, you're hopeless, Togashi.

122
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,760
I'm sorry, please bear with that.

123
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,960
Okay. Thank you.

124
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,460
I almost forgot the cake.

125
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,660
Yes, I'll bring it.

126
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,660
Oh, will you please.

127
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,360
"Happy Birthday, Keiko"

128
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,760
Ready?

129
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,660
I'm going to turn out the lights.

130
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,360
Go ahead, Keiko.

131
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,760
Happy birthday!

132
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,260
Happy birthday.

133
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,860
It's really good.

134
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,660
-All set. -Okay, I'll cut the cake, then.

135
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,060
Keiko?

136
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,960
Keiko, what's the matter?

137
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,760
Keiko, what the matter? Get a hold of yourself!

138
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,460
Keiko!

139
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,560
Keiko?

140
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,660
Ran, get the ambulance!

141
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,460
-Okay. -Get the police, too.

142
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,160
Okay.

143
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,260
Stay back! Don't touch anything on the table!

144
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,360
Inspector, poison was found

145
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,160
from the cup that the victim drank out of after all.

146
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,460
And what about the other glass cups?

147
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,160
No poison was detected from the other four glass cups

148
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,660
or the empty wine bottle.

149
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,460
And on the cup that was used by the victim, Ms. Sawaguchi,

150
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,560
her fingerprints, as well as those of Mr. Togashi,

151
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,960
Mr. Nonaka and Ms. Kojima were also found.

152
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,460
The fingerprints of all four people?

153
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,260
I see.

154
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,860
The glass cup that Ms. Sawaguchi drank from

155
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,360
was the one that Mr. Togashi had passed around

156
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,060
to Ms. Kojima and Mr. Nonaka,

157
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,360
and finally passed around to Ms. Sawaguchi, the victim.

158
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,260
If you want my drink, you can have it.

159
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,560
Go ahead and pass it around.

160
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,460
-Nonaka. -Yes.

161
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,460
I tell you, you're hopeless, Togashi.

162
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,960
-Yes. -And who opened the wine bottle?

163
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,060
It's me.

164
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,760
I pulled the cork off the bottle.

165
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,960
Then, I poured wine for Keiko, the birthday girl,

166
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,160
the guest, Mr. Mouri,

167
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,760
Yuki and myself.

168
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,860
Then I finally took the bottle from Nonaka

169
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,060
and poured wine for myself.

170
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:20,960
Inspector, maybe someone had put poison in the glass cup beforehand?

171
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,360
But Mr. Togashi, you said that you took a sip of wine from your glass

172
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,160
before you gave it to the victim, didn't you?

173
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,260
Yes.

174
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,460
And how do you feel?

175
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,460
Just fine.

176
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:42,260
Then, the poison must've been inserted after he drank the wine.

177
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:46,160
Maybe he just pretended to drink and didn't.

178
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
He drank out of his cup for sure.

179
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,760
I saw him drink after the toast.

180
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,760
Shut up, kid.

181
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,460
If there were ice cubes in the cup,

182
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:02,460
then maybe poison could've been put in the ice cubes beforehand.

183
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,060
I don't think people ever drink wine on the rocks.

184
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,860
True.

185
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,760
And after he took a sip, Mr. Togashi gave that cup of wine to who?

186
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,060
Me, and I gave it to Mr. Nonaka.

187
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,760
He couldn't have put poison in the cup

188
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,460
since everybody was watching.

189
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,760
I see.

190
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,160
I was watching him, too.

191
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,660
Inspector,

192
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,160
when Ms. Sawaguchi blew out the candles,

193
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,360
the room was dark for an instant.

194
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,560
I see.

195
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,060
If then, I guess poison could've been put in.

196
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,760
I see. If then, maybe it would've been possible.

197
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,660
Inspector Megure, how about having everyone take their seats again?

198
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,860
You want to replay the scene of the crime?

199
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,360
Will you help us out, everyone?

200
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,560
Yes.

201
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,560
Sure thing.

202
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,960
Let's start, then.

203
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,660
So, you all sat in this order?

204
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,760
Yes, that's right.

205
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,760
So, the glass cup that the victim received from Mr. Togashi goes here?

206
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,760
Is this correct?

207
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,860
Yes.

208
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,760
I put it there, so there's no mistake about it.

209
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,260
After that, the candles were blown out,

210
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,860
the room got dark,

211
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,760
and the lights were switched back on again right away?

212
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,060
I turned the lights back on with that switch over there.

213
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,560
How long was it pitch dark?

214
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,060
I think it was no more than 4 to 5 seconds,

215
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,860
because I got up and turned on the lights

216
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,760
right after the candles were all blown out.

217
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,860
Do you all agree?

218
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,260
Well...

219
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,460
I think so, too.

220
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,260
Then, the answer is simple.

221
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,260
The only one who could pour poison in the cup

222
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,560
within a period of 4 to 5 seconds

223
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,160
would be the one who was sitting to the right of the victim.

224
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,160
That is the one who was nearest to the cup.

225
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,160
No one other than you, Mr. Nonaka!

226
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,460
Dad.

227
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,160
It... it doesn't have to me.

228
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,560
Even Yuki could've reached the glass if she leaned over.

229
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,060
Why should I do something like that?

230
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,160
Inspector, it's true that from where Ms. Kojima was seated,

231
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,560
she could've done so, too.

232
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,960
Oh, no.

233
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,960
I couldn't have done it.

234
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,660
I'd have to climb over to the table or something to reach the cup.

235
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,960
Or, you went around behind everybody,

236
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,960
came all the way here

237
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,860
and went back to turn on the lights.

238
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,060
No, 4 to 5 seconds isn't enough time.

239
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,660
Even if it were dark,

240
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,460
I'm sure somebody would've sensed you do so if you did.

241
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:48,560
Which means that Mr. Togashi couldn't have done it after all.

242
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,960
Inspector. I guess it would be safe to say

243
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,260
that the killer is either Mr. Nonaka or Ms. Kojima.

244
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,760
Yes.

245
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,760
No.

246
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,860
Why...

247
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,960
why did that person take such a strange attitude?

248
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,860
Wait a second. If that method is used...

249
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,360
I got it.

250
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,360
I figured out the method of how the poison was put inside the cup.

251
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,380
Inspector Megure.

252
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,480
I checked the belongings of the three.

253
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,280
And found this is in Mr. Nonaka's bag.

254
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,480
Just what is it?

255
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,080
That's the bottle that I...

256
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,380
There could be poison inside.

257
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,380
We'll check it out right away.

258
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,880
Please do.

259
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,280
So, Mr. Nonaka.

260
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,380
Will you please explain the bottle that we just found?

261
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,080
I know nothing about it.

262
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,580
That's my bag all right,

263
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,980
but it's the first time I've ever seen that tiny bottle.

264
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,780
That's what they all say,

265
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,780
"I know nothing of it. It's the first time I've seen it".

266
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,680
Officer Takagi!

267
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,780
What is it, Conan?

268
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,980
There is one thing...

269
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,480
What? The same thing?

270
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,380
Yes, sir. As to the detailed substance,

271
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,980
I'll go back to headquarters and analyze it.

272
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,280
This was found in Ms. Sawaguchi's glass

273
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,580
and this was found in the tiny bottle.

274
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,880
The reaction of both is exactly the same.

275
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,580
Mr. Nonaka, we'd like to hear more details from you so.

276
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,280
I... I didn't do it!

277
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,480
Somebody stuck the stuff into my bag!

278
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,680
Please calm down, Mr. Nonaka!

279
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,180
Please come with me to the station!

280
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,880
No good.

281
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,480
Please hear me out, inspector!

282
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,180
I've never seen that bottle, honestly!

283
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,780
Please believe me!

284
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,480
Please wait, inspector!

285
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,980
What is it, Mouri?

286
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,480
Inspector.

287
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,480
Hey, that pose?

288
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,080
That's the Sleeping Kogoro.

289
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,780
I've figured out who the real killer is, inspector.

290
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,480
Real killer?

291
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,880
He's not the one?

292
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,480
Are you saying that it's her?

293
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,580
I didn't...

294
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,380
No. It's not her.

295
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,880
Then, is it Mr. Togashi?

296
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,380
But Dad, I thought you said he didn't have the chance

297
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,680
to insert the poison just a while ago, didn't you?

298
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,580
No, the poison was not inserted afterwards,

299
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,280
but rather, was in the glass, to begin with.

300
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,380
Cut it out. I drank out of the cup myself,

301
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,580
but I'm alive and kicking as you can see for yourself.

302
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,080
That's just it, Mr. Togashi!

303
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,180
That's the very reason why I was suspicious of you to start with.

304
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,480
What?

305
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,580
When someone who drank the same wine as you

306
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,980
starts to suffer in agony,

307
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,280
even if you didn't drink the poison,

308
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,280
you would be worried nonetheless

309
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,480
and get sick for real.

310
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,780
I see. Come to think of it, that's true.

311
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,580
But, you acted differently.

312
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,280
Ms. Sawaguchi drank the poison

313
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,180
and collapsed right before your eyes, yet you...

314
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,080
No, I'm fine.

315
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:24,080
You were completely sure that you didn't drink the poison.

316
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,580
Why?

317
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:32,080
Because you're the one who used a trick to poison Ms. Sawaguchi.

318
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,380
So, there's no mistake about it, Mr. Togashi.

319
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,280
Cut out the gibberish!

320
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,580
If the poison was in there, to begin with,

321
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,280
I would've been poisoned, too.

322
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,280
Right, Yuki?

323
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,780
Just a while ago, Conan found one empty container of gum syrup

324
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,480
from the basket in the kitchen.

325
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,880
The thing is, the murder is possible if gum syrup is used.

326
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,480
Even if the poisoned wine were to be drunk,

327
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,980
the first sip can be drunk without drinking the poison.

328
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,680
Is... is that true, Mr. Mouri?

329
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,380
Yes. First, gum syrup is put into the glass,

330
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,580
then the poison, and the liquid is stirred.

331
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,980
Back then, in one of the five glasses

332
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,480
that Mr. Togashi brought from the kitchen,

333
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,580
gum syrup was inside.

334
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,680
The bottom part of that glass was colored.

335
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,480
Therefore, there was no worry of anyone noticing it.

336
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,080
I see.

337
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,180
Moreover, he poured the wine in slowly.

338
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,180
Even if you pour wine over the gum syrup

339
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,780
which is heavier than the wine,

340
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,880
they won't mix and the wine stays on top of the gum syrup.

341
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,580
In other words, the poison won't mix with the wine.

342
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,380
I see.

343
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,980
It's the same principle as when you put gum syrup into iced coffee

344
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,280
and it sinks to the bottom of the cup.

345
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,480
Then, after the toast,

346
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,380
Mr. Togashi drank the wine for everyone to see.

347
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,880
After which he deliberately tipped over Ms. Sawaguchi's wine glass.

348
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,980
By giving her his own glass,

349
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,280
he made her drink the poison that was at the bottom of the glass cup.

350
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,780
Togashi!

351
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,780
No, it's not me.

352
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,380
Mr. Mouri, all you just said is based only on assumption!

353
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,280
Do you have any proof that I did it?

354
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,980
Did you get the fingerprints I asked you for, Officer Tome?

355
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:37,280
Yes. There were no fingerprints on the sides of the bottle.

356
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,380
But, Conan's fingerprints were found on the bottom of the bottle.

357
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,680
What?

358
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,380
Before the party started,

359
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,580
I goofed and turned your bag upside down, Mr. Togashi.

360
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,280
And at that time, a bottle just like that one came rolling out

361
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,980
so I put it right back into the bag.

362
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,580
Like this, so it wouldn't drop.

363
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,780
Huh? But, it's strange.

364
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,580
I put it back inside Mr. Togashi's bag

365
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,880
and yet, why is it in Mr. Nonaka's camera bag?

366
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,480
Conan, thank you. There's nothing strange about it.

367
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,080
Why not?

368
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,180
Because he sneaked that bottle into Mr. Nonaka's bag.

369
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,980
Mr. Togashi, isn't it right?

370
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,080
Mr. Togashi, you must've worked very carefully

371
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,180
not to leave your fingerprints behind.

372
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:36,980
That's why you didn't bother to wipe off the fingerprints at the end.

373
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,880
I used to date Keiko 2 years ago.

374
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,180
She kept on asking me to get her expensive presents during that time.

375
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,180
I kept giving her stuff despite having to go into debt.

376
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:58,580
Then, in the end, that darn woman had the nerve to switch over to Nonaka.

377
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:02,280
She dumped me as if I were a worn-out rag or something.

378
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,580
I've been waiting for today.

379
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,280
Her 20th birthday.

380
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,280
I planned it out carefully to poison Keiko

381
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:22,080
and then schemed to frame you, Nonaka, up as the killer.

382
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,380
"Mouri Detective Agency"

383
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,480
Oh, right. I almost forgot.

384
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,180
Dad!

385
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,280
Sonoko came back from Germany yesterday

386
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,080
and she brought a bottle of wine as a souvenir.

387
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,280
Would you like to drink it?

388
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,380
Wine?

389
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,480
Sure!

390
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,780
It sure is good!

391
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:31,780
I'm so lucky that it tastes just like the one we had last week.

392
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,180
-Ran... -What?

393
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,980
Oh, you're right.

394
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,980
Well... expensive things sure suit my taste buds.

395
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,580
I made a mistake and gave him the cheap wine I got at a shop nearby.

396
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,880
Cheers!

397
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,980
Who cares? Since he seems to be enjoying himself.

398
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:58,780
Cheap stuff is just the thing for Pops' taste buds.

399
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,060
Next Conan's Hint:

400
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,020
"Sunroof"
