1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,780
Alibis, secret codes, tricks and deals.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,880
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,880
Conan's target finally appears.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,980
It smells of a serious crime.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,580
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,580
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,580
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:57,890
"The Black Organization: One Billion Yen Robbery Case"

9
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,290
Thanks for waiting, Conan.

10
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,890
Was the money for detective services deposited?

11
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,090
Yes! Plenty of it.

12
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,390
It's even too much that it filled up the entire book.

13
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,590
All right!

14
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,290
Let's eat lunch out some place before go home, then.

15
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,790
It's been awhile since I've had a drink from day time.

16
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,890
Dad.

17
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,490
We're talking about lunch.

18
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,490
I'll go get this savings book changed for a new one.

19
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,790
Gosh. What a hopeless drunkard.

20
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,090
The counter is...

21
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,990
What a beauty!

22
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,290
-Miss. -Yes!

23
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,590
Would you help this handsome and attractive man

24
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,490
change his savings book to a new one?

25
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,790
I'm very sorry, sir.

26
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,990
Please get yourself a number over there,

27
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,990
then please have a seat and wait your turn.

28
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,790
Right, we should all wait our turn.

29
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,990
Yes.

30
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,390
I'll be right back.

31
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,390
I've got to get a number, a number.

32
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,590
Miss.

33
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,490
Oh, Conan.

34
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,790
What's wrong?

35
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,790
You seem to be concerned and looking at the clock.

36
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:28,590
I'm a bit busy, so I was hoping that it would be lunch time soon.

37
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,490
I'll see you later, Conan.

38
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,990
Is she somebody you know, Conan?

39
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,690
Yes, her name is Masami Hirota

40
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,490
and she is a new employee who just came here a while ago.

41
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,490
She is usually much kinder.

42
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,590
She... she left.

43
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,290
No way.

44
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,490
Ran, I think he's going to be in here for quite some time,

45
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,890
so I'll wait outside.

46
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,390
Okay, be careful of cars.

47
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,690
It's the parking lot of the bank...

48
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,590
I wonder what that sound was.

49
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,290
They're robbing the armored cash!

50
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,690
There are two robbers.

51
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,190
One of them are armed with a shotgun

52
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,790
and the other with a gun.

53
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,590
What about the other security guards?

54
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,190
Are they dead?

55
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,290
I can't tell from here.

56
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,090
Conan?

57
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,790
What are you doing in a place like this?

58
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,690
We're going home.

59
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,690
Help! It's a robbery!

60
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,590
What's with that car?

61
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,490
They're bank robbers!

62
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,890
-What? -Ran.

63
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,090
Please call the police.

64
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,190
Hey, Conan!

65
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,390
Get an ambulance too,

66
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,890
because there seems to be some people who are hurt!

67
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,490
Ran, notify the bank first.

68
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,890
I'll go and check on the people who are hurt.

69
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,090
Okay!

70
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,290
Darn it! Talk about high speed.

71
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,790
It's as if we're having a car race.

72
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,590
I can barely keep up with them!

73
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,490
Great! A railway crossing!

74
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,990
All right, then!

75
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:29,990
What the...

76
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,790
They are going to run the crossing?

77
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,290
Darn it! I'm not letting them get away!

78
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,790
They got away.

79
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,090
What?

80
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,890
One billion yen was stolen?

81
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:13,190
That's right. All the cash that was supposed to be delivered

82
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,290
from the main bank to all the branches were stolen.

83
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,290
One billion...

84
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:22,190
Conan, you're sure of the license plate number you just gave me?

85
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,290
Yes, I'm sure.

86
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:28,590
There are two of them armed with shotgun and a gun.

87
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:33,090
Well, fortunately, the security guard wasn't seriously hurt.

88
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,790
The armored truck stopped,

89
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,790
so we were getting ready to unload the cash.

90
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,600
That's when we were suddenly attacked by the robbers...

91
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,090
Mr. Koyama? Mr. Murata?

92
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,390
Hey, driver! Is somebody there?

93
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,890
Since I got no response from the driver,

94
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,390
I thought they were killed

95
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,290
and had no choice but to open the door.

96
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,290
Strange. I'm sure that back then I...

97
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,690
After hearing the gun and the window cracked,

98
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,790
ran right over to the entrance of the parking lot

99
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,790
and looked around.

100
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,390
At that time, they were already loading the cash out of the truck.

101
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,890
He shouldn't have had any time to call the driver.

102
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,790
You understand too, don't you?

103
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,790
I really had no other choice.

104
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,690
Excuse me, sir.

105
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,290
You sure are lucky, sir.

106
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,090
Huh? Why am I lucky?

107
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:37,690
Because the window of the armored truck is smoked

108
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,790
so that you can't see anything from the outside, right?

109
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,790
Right.

110
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,790
The bullet that was fired through that smoked window,

111
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,990
and yet it didn't hit you.

112
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,590
Besides, the bullet hit the coin bag,

113
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,090
so it didn't bounce back at you.

114
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,090
You had to either be really lucky

115
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,290
or had planned where to place the coin bag

116
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:58,090
and where to hide beforehand, right?

117
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,790
Don't be ridiculous.

118
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,690
This is still just a possible deduction.

119
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,290
But...

120
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,790
Ms. Hirota!

121
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,390
Where were you at a time like this?

122
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:16,390
I'm sorry, I changed shifts and went out for lunch.

123
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,490
Talk about the young girls nowadays...

124
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,190
Just what time do you think it is?

125
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,590
Is your watch broken or something?

126
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,290
There is one other possibility.

127
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,190
Inspector Megure!

128
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,190
What's up, Officer Takagi?

129
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,790
There was a report that what looked to be the runaway van was found.

130
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,890
What? Where?

131
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,090
By the riverbed of the Teimutsu River,

132
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,390
beside the TR railway bridge.

133
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,290
Okay, let's head off right away.

134
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,990
Come with me too, Mr. Mouri.

135
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,190
Sure!

136
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,290
Ran, you take Conan and go on home.

137
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,590
Okay.

138
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,690
Let's get going then.

139
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,490
Conan?

140
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,990
Gosh, he's gone again.

141
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,190
So, what's the story, Officer Tome?

142
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,190
Oh, Inspector Megure.

143
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,890
I just took a quick look,

144
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,290
but the fingerprints the runaway van have been wiped off clean.

145
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,490
What other clues are left?

146
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,190
Well, as for pretty large sized clues,

147
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,990
there are three cases in the bed of the truck.

148
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,890
But there are no fingerprints on them either, and...

149
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,390
Hey, bring me the stuff we found a while ago!

150
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,690
This was thrown out on the driver's seat.

151
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,190
Oh, thanks.

152
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,790
Take a look at this.

153
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,990
These are...

154
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,590
A mask and gloves.

155
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:49,090
Well, although I'm pretty sure we can't expect any prints on them either.

156
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,690
So you're here too, sonny.

157
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:51,990
Sonny?

158
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,490
Hello, Officer Tome!

159
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,090
Hey! I thought I told you to go on home with Ran!

160
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,990
There's something on the inside of the mask.

161
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,990
On the inside of the mask?

162
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,290
What's this pink colored soil?

163
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,790
This pink color is...

164
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,590
But why?

165
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,890
Okay, then.

166
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,090
I'm borrowing this for a while!

167
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,390
Hey!

168
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,190
Just as I thought.

169
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,390
It hurts!

170
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,790
You don't "It hurts" me!

171
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,990
What do you think you're doing with the important clues?

172
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,690
That's enough!

173
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,790
So, the case started off as an ordinary the others.

174
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:37,790
However, this is no ordinary case of robbery.

175
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:42,090
It didn't take me long to prove that my hunch was right.

176
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,980
What? The robber the other day was killed?

177
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,980
Yes, a former racer, Jiro Kaizuka was found shot to death in bed.

178
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,080
Former racer? No wonder the van was so fast.

179
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,980
How did they figure out that he was the robber?

180
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,880
A memo of the blueprint of the bank,

181
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,180
the schedule of the armored cash transport truck,

182
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:10,780
as well as a map of the get away route was found in his room.

183
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,680
Furthermore...

184
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,680
another person was killed last night with same gun he had.

185
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,180
-What? -Huh?

186
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,380
The security guard, Kishii.

187
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,680
Huh? Which means that Mr. Kishii was also a member of the group?

188
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,780
I'm sure he was an accomplice.

189
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,080
He liked gambling and seemed to have a lot debts.

190
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,580
He probably played the role of being frightened

191
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,180
into opening the rear of the armored truck from the inside.

192
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,080
The rear door of an armored truck

193
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,180
cannot be opened unless from the inside.

194
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,580
Does that mean that the two were maybe killed by the other robber?

195
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,880
Probably.

196
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,380
Because the money that was stolen is gone.

197
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:59,780
The other robber probably killed the two to take all the money.

198
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,980
It seems that Inspector Megure

199
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,680
is going to check in on things on that line.

200
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,680
But I'm sure that it's only a matter of time before they are caught.

201
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,080
What do you mean?

202
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,280
Pink colored lipstick was found in Kaizuka's room.

203
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,180
Lipstick?

204
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,380
It matched the color

205
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,680
that was found on the mask that the robbers left behind.

206
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,980
Moreover...

207
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,780
It also matched the color

208
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,380
that bank employee Ms. Masami Hirota is using, right?

209
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,180
Conan.

210
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,680
One of the her colleagues testified

211
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,780
that it matched the color of lipstick she is using.

212
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,080
She left the bank saying she was going out lunch,

213
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,980
so I'm sure she went to the back door and joined them.

214
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,080
But why would a bank employee do something like that?

215
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,980
I don't know.

216
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,380
But she has already quit the bank.

217
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,680
She handed in a resignation this morning.

218
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,280
What?

219
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,480
She started working for this bank only half a year ago.

220
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,780
What do you mean?

221
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,180
She just snuck into the bank to check thinks out

222
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,880
before committing the crime.

223
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,580
It's more natural if you think of it that way.

224
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,680
Well, I guess that how it is.

225
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,180
I'm sure...

226
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,080
I'm sure things took place on the whole.

227
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,280
But there is still one question left.

228
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,580
I wonder if she would really make her lipstick rub off.

229
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,680
After all, she spent a half a year to check the bank out.

230
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,880
Besides, the lipstick on the mask was situated too low

231
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,980
that the chin would be there and not the lips.

232
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,480
And above all...

233
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,580
It would've smelled of make-up if she wore the mask,

234
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,980
but there was no such smell on it.

235
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,680
What if someone schemed this all

236
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,880
and is trying to frame her up as the robber?

237
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,180
Oh, no.

238
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,980
Conan, where are you going?

239
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,080
Let him be, let him be.

240
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,880
Hello, this is Inspector Megure.

241
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,780
Oh, Mr. Mouri.

242
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,780
Ms. Masami Hirota's address?

243
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,980
We've already checked her place out.

244
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,480
Yes, I know.

245
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,780
But I have something I'd like to confirm.

246
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,780
Here it is. It's this room!

247
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,680
Let's see...

248
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,980
If my deduction is right, Ms. Masami is in danger.

249
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,180
I wonder if... if there's some clue somewhere.

250
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,580
The outlet is blocked off by the leg of the desk.

251
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,780
No, maybe it's deliberately blocked off.

252
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,080
Could it be that...

253
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,880
This is...

254
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,880
This is a key to a coin locker.

255
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,880
This is probably where the stolen money is hidden.

256
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,580
Don't go, Ms. Masami Hirota.

257
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,480
If you go, you'll be killed.

258
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,280
Thank you.

259
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,780
But I'm sorry, Gonan.

260
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,980
Wait!

261
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,480
Darn it, there's nobody here.

262
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,880
There she is!

263
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,780
It's Ms. Masami!

264
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,480
Okay, I'll use this transmitter and my suspenders.

265
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,580
Stick on it, please.

266
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,980
Go for it!

267
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,480
All right!

268
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,080
Okay, she's started off!

269
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,780
I won't let you get away!

270
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,880
There's no doubt that she is being used by someone.

271
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,780
But who on earth is pulling the strings behind her?

272
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,980
Where are you? Come out here!

273
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,680
Good work.

274
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,280
Masami Hirota.

275
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,480
Or rather...

276
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,280
Akemi Miyano!

277
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,380
May I ask you a question?

278
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,780
Why did you kill those two?

279
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,580
That's the way we do things.

280
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,380
Now, hand over the cash.

281
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,980
It's not here. I have it in another place.

282
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,280
What?

283
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,980
Before I give it to you, get my sister!

284
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,680
Bring my sister here!

285
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,080
You promised, didn't you?

286
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,480
That when this job is over,

287
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,580
you will let me and my sister out of this organization!

288
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,280
There's no deal here.

289
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:55,180
Because she's an indispensable brain to the organization.

290
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,880
Your sister, unlike you,

291
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,380
is a necessity to the organization.

292
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,180
Which means that you didn't intend to...

293
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,280
Come on, this is your last chance.

294
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,980
Tell us where the money is.

295
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,280
Don't be silly.

296
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,580
If you kill me, the whereabouts of the cash will be unknown forever.

297
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,880
You're the one who's being silly.

298
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,580
We already know that you have the key to the coin locker.

299
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,880
Besides, this is your last chance.

300
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,880
A gunshot?

301
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,180
That way!

302
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,380
Ms. Masami!

303
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,580
Get a hold of yourself, Ms. Masami!

304
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,280
Conan...

305
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,680
How did you know I was here?

306
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,480
I stuck a transmitter onto your car.

307
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,980
I was sure that you were coming to see

308
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,480
these people who were pulling the strings from behind the scene.

309
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,780
Darn it! If I only explained everything to you back then!

310
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,080
Who are you?

311
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,680
Edogawa...

312
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,680
Or rather,

313
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,880
Shinichi Kudo, a detective.

314
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,580
Shinichi Kudo...

315
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,680
So, you're him.

316
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,780
That's right. I've heard rumors about you.

317
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,180
The two men that I hired were killed.

318
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,380
And me too, by the organization...

319
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,780
Organization?

320
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,180
It's a large, mysterious organization.

321
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,580
The only thing that one who is on the bottom of the line knows

322
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,280
is that the color of this organization is black.

323
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,580
Black?

324
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,880
Yes.

325
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,680
The people of the organization favor wearing that color.

326
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,280
Black clothes as black as a crow.

327
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,880
May ask you to do me a last favor?

328
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,580
Here.

329
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,680
This is the real key.

330
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,580
The one they took is fake.

331
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,680
It's for the coin locker at the east side of Beika Station.

332
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,880
Please, before they realize what's going on.

333
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,980
I don't ever want to be used by them again.

334
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,580
I'm counting on you, Little Detective.

335
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,080
Hello.

336
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,680
I'd like to speak to Inspector Megure of the 1st Division.

337
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:33,780
Since the only fingerprints found on the gun were hers,

338
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,380
it was concluded that she committed suicide

339
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,080
thinking she could not get away.

340
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,180
The one billion yen that was robbed was safely collected,

341
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,480
and it looked to be that the case was close.

342
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,480
But no, it's not over at all!

343
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,580
I will never forgive those guys.

344
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,380
I'll nab then for sure with these very hands of mine.

345
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,680
Definitely.

346
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,680
Definitely!

347
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,380
Next Conan's Hint:

348
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,880
"Blue baseball cap"
