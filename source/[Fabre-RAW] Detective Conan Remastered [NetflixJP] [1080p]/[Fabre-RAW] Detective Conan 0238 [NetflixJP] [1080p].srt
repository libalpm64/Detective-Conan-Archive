1
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,390
Even destiny serves as a clue to the deduction.

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,390
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,190
Today, the case takes place in Osaka.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,490
It's an exciting case at "K3".

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,890
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,790
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,690
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,000
"Mouri Detective Agency"

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,200
What?

10
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,500
A party for a restaurant's opening?

11
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,100
Yeah, that's right.

12
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,600
Actually, it was my mom and dad that got invited,

13
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,100
but they both came down with a cold and said they can't go,

14
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,400
so I thought I'd invite you guys.

15
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,200
I mean, after all,

16
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,100
three famous athletes from America

17
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,700
are opening a restaurant here in Japan, everyone here's so excited!

18
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,800
-Hey, listen. -What is it?

19
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
Where's the party going to be?

20
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,100
Over here, of course!

21
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,100
In Osaka, where else?

22
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,100
I pass.

23
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,100
That was fast.

24
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,700
Come on, just for a little while.

25
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,700
Sorry, but I've got research to do back here.

26
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,900
I'm back!

27
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,400
Hi.

28
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,300
Who are you talking to?

29
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,000
It's Dr. Agasa.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,100
He's repairing some earring mobile phones for me.

31
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,000
What's the matter? Did somebody come back?

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,300
If this is a bad time, do you want me to call you back later?

33
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,300
No, never mind, it's all right.

34
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,300
Are you sure?

35
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,500
Anyway, don't turn me down so fast.

36
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,600
You're going to be able to see famous athletes in the flesh.

37
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,100
There's pro boxer Ricardo Balera,

38
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,500
Mike Norwood the Major Leaguer

39
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,900
and...

40
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,700
"The 3K's Incident in Osaka (Part 1)"

41
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,800
Look at that, they're all here!

42
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,700
There's Mai Kuraki,

43
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,100
Miho Komatsu,

44
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,300
and Two Mix

45
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,900
and then, the love of my life,

46
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,400
Yoko Okino!

47
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,200
Don't talk so loud, dad!

48
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,900
You're being so obvious.

49
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,750
And what about you? You brought an autograph board with you.

50
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,250
Are you sure it's all right, Kazuha?

51
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,150
I'm mean there are so many famous people here

52
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,850
and we weren't officially invited, should we be here at all?

53
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,450
Don't worry about it.

54
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,350
Besides, your dad's a famous person, too.

55
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,550
I wonder.

56
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,050
I have a bigger problem than that.

57
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,850
Has Heiji done something?

58
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,750
He's been acting strange.

59
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,250
What do you mean?

60
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,250
He was whispering to someone on the telephone

61
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,050
and he said, "Are you alone now?",

62
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,750
"Are you sure no one's caught on?", and

63
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,850
"If this is a bad time, do you want me to call back later?", things like that.

64
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,550
You don't mean...

65
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,150
I do, he's having an affair.

66
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,750
I'm sure that Heiji's been taken in by some floozy.

67
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,650
Maybe he's told her to come here.

68
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,050
That was me, he was talking to me on the phone.

69
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,050
It's finally starting.

70
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,750
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for waiting.

71
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,950
It is my honor to introduce the three stars of tonight's party

72
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,650
who also happen to be the owners of this World Restaurant K3!

73
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,850
First, the undefeated former world middleweight champion!

74
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,050
"Ricardo Balera (36)" -Mr. Ricardo Balera!

75
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,950
Next the pitcher who received the 160 kilometer Cy Young trophy,

76
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,050
Mr. Mike Norwood!

77
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,550
"Mike Norwood (45)"

78
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,850
And the man fearfully known as Europe's steel stronghold,

79
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,750
the famous goalkeeper,

80
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,350
Mr. Ray Curtis!

81
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,550
"Ray Curtis (37)"

82
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,150
This is great!

83
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,450
It's the real things!

84
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,550
Well, aren't you glad you came?

85
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,050
Yeah.

86
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,150
And now I'd like to ask these three men some questions.

87
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:07,050
Why did you decide to open a restaurant in Japan?

88
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:11,250
Why did you choose to open your restaraunt in Japan?

89
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,250
The reason is, to the three of us,

90
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,550
Japan is our second home.

91
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,550
He speaks Japanese.

92
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,350
My wife,

93
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,150
as well as Mike's,

94
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,750
is Japanese.

95
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,950
And as for Ricardo, he's crazy about ninjas and samurais!

96
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,350
By the way, about the K in the restaurant's name,

97
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,850
I imagine it stands for king, doesn't it?

98
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,150
No, no. You're mistaken.

99
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,350
The first K stands for knock out.

100
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,950
It's the K from K.O.

101
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,450
The second K is for strikeout.

102
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,250
K for strikeout.

103
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,050
The third K is for goal keeper.

104
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,050
It's the K in keeper.

105
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,050
I see.

106
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,750
Haven't you forgotten another one, Ray?

107
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,150
You know it very well.

108
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,250
It's a Japanese word that describes perfectly men

109
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,750
like you who are smeared with scandal.

110
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,250
"Ed McKay (48), Reporter" -K for "kitanai". (Dirty)

111
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,250
Hey, Ed. Watch your language, get out!

112
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,250
Mike, what did he say?

113
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,050
Hey, it's you who should watch your language.

114
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,850
As you can see, I'm a guest here, I had an invitation.

115
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,850
I don't know who sent it to me, but I really appreciated it

116
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,050
because I just love sushi.

117
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,250
Who the heck is he?

118
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,750
He's as well known American.

119
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,950
He's a reporter that's made a name for himself

120
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,250
by writing about scandals that famous athletes are involved in.

121
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,150
Most of it's made up,

122
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,850
but he writes so vaguely,

123
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,850
even if he's taken to court, he's hardly ever charged.

124
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,950
I guess you should be careful then, Heiji.

125
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,950
What do you mean by that?

126
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,950
Gee, I wonder.

127
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,650
Let's move things along now

128
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,750
and start with the question and answer portion of the presentation.

129
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,850
Is there anyone in the audience

130
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,750
who would like to ask these gentlemen a question?

131
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,450
Don't be shy, come on up.

132
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,050
I have one!

133
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,650
A brave young lady has her hand raised!

134
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,250
Please, come up on to the stage.

135
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,050
Ran...

136
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,150
All right, young lady, ask away.

137
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,250
Well, uh...

138
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,050
It's not really a question, I have a favor to ask.

139
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,950
Mr. Curtis, may I have your autograph?

140
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,650
What's she doing?

141
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,650
You, won't do it?

142
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:53,650
No, no.

143
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,650
They're not autographing anything today.

144
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,150
Okay, it's okay.

145
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:00,950
I'll do it as a special favor for this young lady

146
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,950
for brightening up this party, again.

147
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,350
Thank you so much.

148
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,950
All right, how about if I sign

149
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,150
one of my uniforms?

150
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,250
Really, will you do that for me?

151
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,450
No, you can't do that.

152
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,350
Those are for the lottery...

153
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,150
Don't worry about it. There are still three left.

154
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,950
But...

155
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,950
If you don't mind, could you write in this name?

156
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,350
Okay. What's your name, young lady?

157
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,950
Well, not my name.

158
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,650
Shinichi.

159
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:35,050
Could you please sign it "To Shinichi"?

160
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,750
-Is he your boyfriend? -Oh, no. It's nothing like that.

161
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,850
Oh, she remembered

162
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,950
that I'm Ray's fan.

163
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,050
You better give her a call later.

164
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,350
Yeah, you don't have to tell me.

165
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,850
Isn't it strange though?

166
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,050
What do you mean?

167
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,450
The goal keeper usually wears number 1,

168
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,550
why is his number 8?

169
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,650
Ray was originally a mid-fielder.

170
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,950
But during the Would Cup Series,

171
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:07,150
both goal keepers were thrown out of the game and the team was in a bind,

172
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,950
so Ray had no choice but to go in as a keeper.

173
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,250
He performed super saves one after the other

174
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,550
and the team managed to come in second place!

175
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,650
From then on,

176
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,750
even when he was a goal keeper for a league in Spain in the Serie A,

177
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,450
he kept the number 8!

178
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:27,350
And he's continued wearing it even now when he's in the Major League Soccer.

179
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,350
Then answer me this.

180
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,450
What about the number 99?

181
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,950
He's a pitcher, isn't he?

182
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,950
Isn't that too big a number?

183
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,750
That stands for 99 miles.

184
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,250
In Japan, it's equivalent to 160 kilometers.

185
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,950
His goal was to pitch balls that fast,

186
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,750
that's why he wore the number 99.

187
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,950
And what about the number 4?

188
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,950
See, it's written on the boxing gloves along with the signature.

189
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:58,350
That's because Ricardo always scored a K.O. win in the 4th round.

190
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,850
So he added the 4 along with his signature.

191
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:03,950
I didn't know that.

192
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,750
You should've done your research before you got here.

193
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,050
Well, excuse me.

194
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,350
Telephone numbers interested me more than uniform numbers.

195
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,450
What's wrong with you? You keep mentioning that.

196
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,650
You figure it out.

197
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,150
Sorry to keep you waiting.

198
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,750
Seriously.

199
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,750
You did this for some guy who's gallivanting who knows where.

200
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,150
That's my business, not yours.

201
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,150
Oh, yes.

202
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,250
It's for you, Conan.

203
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,150
It's a ticket for the special game.

204
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,850
Ray will be playing in tomorrow at Nagai Stadium.

205
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,050
He gave it to me just now, but it's a secret.

206
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,050
You will go, won't you?

207
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,250
Of course, I'll go.

208
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,850
Cool.

209
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,550
That was generous.

210
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,950
But I had to agree to their one condition.

211
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,650
Here, look at this.

212
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,450
A transceiver?

213
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,850
They said they want to surprise everyone.

214
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,250
Ray, it's okay. I'm here.

215
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,050
No, Ricardo, that's the wrong place.

216
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,450
Left, to the left.

217
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,550
Oh, I get it now,

218
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,650
they're trying to form the letter K by turning on the lights

219
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,550
in the hotel rooms above the restaurant

220
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:10,650
before the hotel opens!

221
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,950
When the guests come out of the restaurant,

222
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,650
they're really going to be surprised.

223
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,650
But they don't have to do it themselves.

224
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:21,150
They thought it up themselves, that's why they want to do it on their own.

225
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,150
If even one of them is seen outside,

226
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,850
it would cause quite a commotion,

227
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,650
that's why they wanted us to stand outside and see if the letter is formed right.

228
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,350
Ran, are the lights I'm supposed to turn on all on already?

229
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,350
The end part of the last row of the K is still off.

230
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,650
Okay. I'm going right now.

231
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:45,150
Mike, open the curtains, open them.

232
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,550
Okay?

233
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,650
Okay.

234
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,250
Ricardo, you're good, too!

235
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,450
Okay.

236
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,150
Ran, it is on?

237
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,550
Let's see.

238
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,750
Yes, it's on!

239
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,350
All right!

240
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,850
The K is completed!

241
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,750
The window...

242
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,650
And there were gunshots, too.

243
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,550
What?

244
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,950
What happened?

245
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,650
Is that a shot?

246
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:18,950
Hey, wait!

247
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:22,350
Kazuha, tell those three not to leave the rooms!

248
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,350
Hey.

249
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,950
Hey! Wait up!

250
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,350
-That's the room. -Yes.

251
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,350
This is the guy, he's that reporter from the party.

252
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,250
He must've been shot with this gun.

253
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,550
He's holding something in his left hand.

254
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,850
What the...

255
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,450
A... a belt?

256
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,010
The window...

257
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,010
And there were gunshots, too.

258
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,910
Hey, wait!

259
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,910
Kazuha, tell those three not to leave the rooms!

260
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,210
-That's the room. -Yes.

261
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:28,910
This is the guy, he's that reporter from the party.

262
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,810
He must've been shot with this gun.

263
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,710
He's holding something in his left hand.

264
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,710
What the...

265
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,710
A... a belt?

266
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:46,310
The victim is an American living in Chicago.

267
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:49,310
He's a reporter, name Ed McKay, 48 years old.

268
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,710
"Inspector Otaki" -He was shot in the chest

269
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,310
and died almost immediately.

270
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:58,010
The weapon used was a Smith & Wesson revolver.

271
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,110
There are signs of a slight struggle,

272
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,510
so he must have been alive for a short time after being shot.

273
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:07,910
Heiji, do you know what time you heard the shot?

274
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,510
Sure. I'm sure it was a little past 8:05 pm.

275
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,810
Kazuha and the rest of us were outside the hotel when we heard it,

276
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,610
and we saw the window crack, so I'm pretty sure about it.

277
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,610
What do you mean outside the hotel?

278
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,810
Where you leaving the party so soon?

279
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,210
No, no.

280
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,110
Those three guys asked us to do them a favor.

281
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,110
They asked us to check to see

282
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,710
if the lights in the hotel formed the letter K

283
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,310
like they planned.

284
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,810
Those three?

285
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,910
Of course. They own the K3 restaurant,

286
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,710
Ricardo Balera, former pro boxer,

287
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,210
major leaguer Mike Norwood,

288
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,610
and pro soccer player, Ray Curtis.

289
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:51,410
And by chance, were they the ones who turned the lights on, too?

290
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,910
Yeah, that's right.

291
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,810
Ray was in charge of 5, the first and second rows,

292
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,710
Mike was in charge of 4, the third and fourth rows

293
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,710
and Ricardo was in charge of the two

294
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,810
on the very top fifth row.

295
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,010
So that means its possible for those three

296
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,410
to have committed the murder.

297
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,210
It sure is possible.

298
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,510
Especially since it seems they all didn't like that reporter.

299
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,510
But they couldn't have done it.

300
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,110
This room is in the center of the second row, isn't it?

301
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,810
When the shot was fired, the three of them were in different rooms.

302
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:23,810
Isn't right, Ran?

303
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:28,210
Do you know which rooms they were in?

304
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,910
I'm positive Mike was in the room directly above this one.

305
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,310
He opened the curtains that were partially drawn.

306
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,710
Right after that,

307
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,910
Ricardo turned off the light in the second room from the left

308
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,910
on the top floor which he'd turned on by mistake,

309
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,210
and right after that,

310
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,610
Ray turned on the light in the room

311
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,710
on the right of the very bottom which he'd forgotten to turn on.

312
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,410
Just when we thought the letter K was complete,

313
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,210
we heard the gunshot and the window shattered.

314
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,910
Did you see the three of them at that time?

315
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,010
No.

316
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,810
But only 5 seconds had passed since Mike opened the curtains.

317
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,910
And Ray poked his head out the window,

318
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,110
and it was only about 3 seconds later that we heard the gunshot.

319
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,310
And right after that,

320
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,710
all three of them looked outside and asked what was going on.

321
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,410
Then who is the killer?

322
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:16,410
Mabe it was one of the guests at the party?

323
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,910
What?

324
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:21,410
Remember, when Heiji and I got here,

325
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,910
the place was crowded with people already.

326
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,310
I'm sure the killer was hiding in one of the rooms close by

327
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,010
and got away in the midst of the commotion.

328
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:36,510
But if that's true, then all the party guests are suspects

329
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,610
and it's going to take a lot of time to question all of them.

330
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,710
Hey, what's this?

331
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,210
Look, look at this guy's left hand.

332
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,710
He's holding on to something.

333
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,310
A belt?

334
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,910
And look at this man's finger on his right hands.

335
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:55,410
His baby and ring fingers are bent.

336
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,010
Do you think he and the killer were playing paper, rock and scissors?

337
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,510
Conan!

338
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,910
Hey, Heiji,

339
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,510
are you thinking what I'm thinking?

340
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,510
Yeah. I think that as he was dying,

341
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,110
he tried to leave a clue through the belt and the shape of his hand,

342
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,110
it's his dying message.

343
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,310
But you don't know for sure

344
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,210
that he was indicating the belt is the clue, right?

345
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,210
He might have meant his pants,

346
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:19,910
he might have wanted to remove his pants and show something.

347
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,210
Fool!

348
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,510
If he meant his pants, he'd put his hand on the edge of his pants.

349
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,510
If he meant to take his belt off,

350
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,910
he'd have put his fingers on the edge of the belt, right?

351
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,910
I don't think any guy would clutch his belt Iike that

352
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,310
if he wanted to take it off.

353
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,710
All right then, I'll take this as a hint and keep it in mind

354
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,910
when I question all the guests

355
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,610
who's been waiting in the restaurant downstairs.

356
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,310
No, that won't be necessary.

357
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,910
-What? -I've figured it out.

358
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,710
The killer is one of those three.

359
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,610
The belt... that's right,

360
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,910
only one who has fought bravely

361
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,010
has the honor of wearing it around his waist,

362
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,210
it proves he is a champion,

363
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,310
which means the killer

364
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,510
is former middleweight champion, Ricardo Baleral.

365
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,910
So what do the fingers mean?

366
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,910
If Ricardo always knocked out his opponent in the fourth round,

367
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,710
shouldn't his fingers indicate four?

368
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,210
All right then, it's Ray, the pro soccer player.

369
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,110
He's played in 3 countries, Italy, Spain and America,

370
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:14,410
and always led his team to victory.

371
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:17,910
Ray also played in a premier league in England and they became champions.

372
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,510
Oh, I see.

373
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,710
Hey, maybe it doesn't mean 3,

374
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,810
maybe it has something to do with baseball.

375
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,910
You know, when the pitcher throws his pitch,

376
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,810
he holds the ball with three fingers, doesn't he?

377
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,610
That's it!

378
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,110
The killer is a major leaguer, Mike, it's settled.

379
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,710
You don't know anything about baseball.

380
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,510
Mike's team never won a championship

381
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,710
and even if they did, you don't get championship belts in baseball!

382
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,110
And that goes for soccer, too.

383
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,610
The key to this case is the fingers on his right hand

384
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,210
and the "white band" gripped by his left hand.

385
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,310
I guess we're going to have to solve this puzzle first.

386
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,710
-Band? -What?

387
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,810
Don't some people refer to a belt as a band?

388
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,810
The only people who do are old fogeys.

389
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:05,310
Band, three...

390
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,710
Band three,

391
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,810
bandthree!

392
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:11,110
That's it, he meant someone named Bandthree.

393
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,810
All right! Locate the guest named Bandthree

394
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,110
and the case will be solved.

395
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,410
Hey, Heiji,

396
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:23,810
are you sure that's the famous "Sleeping Kogoro"?

397
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:26,410
I know what you mean, I think he's a little drunk tonight.

398
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,010
Well, I guess we don't have a choice,

399
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,510
let's forget about the dying message for now.

400
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:33,010
Shall we start testing everyone for powder burns?

401
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,010
I guess you're right,

402
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:37,410
we'll start with the guests waiting in the restaurant downstairs.

403
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:41,610
And of course those three men waiting in the room.

404
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,110
Okay, next.

405
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,510
Excuse me.

406
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,710
-Yes? -Is your name Bandthree, by any chance?

407
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,310
No, it isn't!

408
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:05,010
Oh, pardon me.

409
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:10,510
Well? Did anybody test positive, Inspector Otaki?

410
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,510
No, not yet.

411
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,510
How about those three?

412
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:18,810
We tested them first but they all came out negative.

413
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,010
Did you do a body check?

414
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:23,910
Yeah, we did a simple body check but...

415
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,210
Gosh, those managers they have...

416
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:29,210
They've been giving us a hard time.

417
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,710
But never mind that.

418
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,710
Is it true what Mr. Mouri said?

419
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:35,210
Did those three really hate that reporter?

420
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,210
Yeah, seems that way.

421
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,810
Ricardo was suspected of throwing about

422
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,110
and forced to retire while he was unbeaten.

423
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,510
Ray was thrown out of the European league

424
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,110
on suspicions of drug use.

425
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:52,710
Mike got divorced because he was having an affair

426
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,410
but he's married to a Japanese girl now,

427
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,310
and they seem to be getting along just fine.

428
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,810
And all of their problems were caused by

429
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,810
the murdered reporter's unsubstantiated articles.

430
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,010
But Heiji,

431
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,010
how do you know they were unsubstantiated?

432
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,110
They took him to court and won.

433
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,910
They proved they weren't involved in the scandals.

434
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,210
I see.

435
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:17,710
That's why I don't think they had any motive for killing him.

436
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,710
I think you're right.

437
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,310
Come on, Kudo.

438
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,110
What's with you?

439
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:30,310
You're acting kind of strange.

440
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,500
Next Conan's Hint:

441
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,220
"Gun Powder Residue"

442
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,800
In the next episode, the case in Osaka will be solved.

443
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,940
Who did Hattori call?

444
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,340
Don't tell Kazuha!
