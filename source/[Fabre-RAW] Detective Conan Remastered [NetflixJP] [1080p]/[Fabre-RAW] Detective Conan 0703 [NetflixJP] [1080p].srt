1
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:05,455
I participated in the Bell Tree Express event

2
00:00:05,455 --> 00:00:07,055
with the members of the Youth Detective Squad,

3
00:00:07,055 --> 00:00:09,155
Ran and the others.

4
00:00:09,155 --> 00:00:13,993
Suspicious passengers are gathered in car number 8.

5
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:17,455
The deduction quiz that is held on the train,

6
00:00:17,455 --> 00:00:21,255
in the wink of an eye turns into a locked room murder.

7
00:00:24,355 --> 00:00:26,955
In the mean time, the dark shadow of the Organization

8
00:00:26,955 --> 00:00:29,755
closes in on Haibara.

9
00:00:31,255 --> 00:00:33,055
Aim for a 100% solution.

10
00:00:33,055 --> 00:00:35,455
Clear all mysteries and codes.

11
00:00:35,455 --> 00:00:37,555
A mysterious character and queer trick.

12
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:39,655
Destiny closes in on the speeding train.

13
00:00:39,655 --> 00:00:41,155
He sees through the one and only truth.

14
00:00:41,155 --> 00:00:43,255
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult!

15
00:00:43,255 --> 00:00:45,755
His name is Detective Conan!

16
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:32,131
"Pitch Black Mystery Express Train (Crossing)"

17
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:34,809
The fire five years ago?

18
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:38,609
What does that have to do with me?

19
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:41,209
No use playing dumb.

20
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:42,609
We confirmed just a while ago

21
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:43,709
with the Shizuoka Prefectural Police

22
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:45,709
that was in charge of the incident.

23
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:49,209
We found your name among the people who were rescued.

24
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:50,809
Isn't that right?

25
00:02:50,809 --> 00:02:53,509
Kendo friends with a rich ex-member of the Self-Defence Force

26
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:55,709
who died in the fire, aren't you Mr. Taisaku Noto?

27
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,809
Oh, yeah.

28
00:02:57,809 --> 00:03:00,609
The scar on my cheek is what I got back then.

29
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:02,609
But, it's not that I was hiding it.

30
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:04,163
Come to think of it, you...

31
00:03:04,163 --> 00:03:05,509
when we first met,

32
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:08,167
you were carrying something over your shoulder, weren't you?

33
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:09,909
Maybe you had the tool that you used

34
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:13,409
for the locked room murder trick in there?

35
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:15,409
That's just a mere bamboo sword!

36
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:17,109
Bamboo sword?

37
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:22,209
See. Only the bamboo sword is inside, right?

38
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:26,185
I promised to have a match with a friend of mine

39
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:28,187
in Nagoya later!

40
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:30,209
At any rate, if you're done...

41
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:32,191
Then, sir.

42
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:34,609
Will you run along the corridor for me?

43
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:35,809
Run?

44
00:03:35,809 --> 00:03:36,809
Yep!

45
00:03:36,809 --> 00:03:40,909
We may have seen the rear view of the culprit when he fled.

46
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:45,309
I'd like to take a movie of you running.

47
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:49,209
I, indeed am Ando

48
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:51,409
who was rescued along with Mr. Murobashi

49
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:53,309
from the fire back then.

50
00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:56,215
I didn't mention it because you didn't ask.

51
00:03:56,215 --> 00:04:00,809
By the way, what is that big bag you have in your room?

52
00:04:00,809 --> 00:04:04,809
Oh, that's a picture that I was asked to appraise.

53
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:07,309
Unfortunately, it was fake, though.

54
00:04:07,309 --> 00:04:09,409
May take a look at it?

55
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:11,209
Yes.

56
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:18,237
It's sure is heavy.

57
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:20,239
The frame is pure gold, you see.

58
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:23,609
I see, pure gold, eh.

59
00:04:23,609 --> 00:04:25,609
By the way, what was your relationship

60
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:27,909
with the rich man who died in the fire?

61
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:30,249
He was a collector of fine arts,

62
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:33,709
so I introduced a lot of masterpieces to him.

63
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:38,257
But, almost all of them burned in the fire.

64
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:41,909
But, it's so very heavy. You're pretty strong

65
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:44,909
being able to carry something like this alone.

66
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,109
Huh? Oh, well, sort of.

67
00:04:47,109 --> 00:04:50,909
Then, will you run along the corridor for me, sir?

68
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:57,009
Yes. I can't forget about that fire.

69
00:04:57,009 --> 00:04:59,909
Because thanks to that fire,

70
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:04,283
I need this wheelchair to take care of me.

71
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:06,009
You hurt your legs in the fire?

72
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:10,609
Yes. That's why I can't run along the corridor

73
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:12,291
like the others.

74
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:15,709
But your maid Ms. Sumitomo can, can't she?

75
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:21,509
All... all I have to do is run?

76
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:24,809
Yeah. Like you always do.

77
00:05:27,609 --> 00:05:29,809
It's hard to believe that the culprit can be specified

78
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:32,311
doing something like this, though.

79
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:34,309
Granny,

80
00:05:34,309 --> 00:05:36,909
your maid runs pretty fast,

81
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:40,609
was she into sports or something?

82
00:05:40,609 --> 00:05:43,309
Please answer me.

83
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,309
Granny.

84
00:05:52,809 --> 00:05:54,709
It's true that I was the fiance

85
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:57,209
of the grandson of the rich man who died in the fire,

86
00:05:57,209 --> 00:05:58,337
and it's also true that

87
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:00,809
I was rescued from the burning flames too.

88
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:02,809
But, what does that have to do with me

89
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:05,409
running along the corridor for you?

90
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:07,609
Just to be safe.

91
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:11,909
Please just unlock your door and let me into your room.

92
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:15,209
If you insist on coming in, bring a search warrant!

93
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,909
Don't be ridiculous.

94
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:19,409
Then, did that wristwatch that you said

95
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:22,909
you found in your room, has it rung since?

96
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:24,363
Wristwatch?

97
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:30,009
As you can see, it's left where it is, but it hasn't rung.

98
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:31,909
Huh? Where?

99
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:35,009
See! It's on the sofa.

100
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:37,909
I can't see from just this space.

101
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:40,379
Huh? Wait a sec.

102
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:44,409
I got a glimpse of it when Mr. Murobashi's body was found.

103
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:46,709
From between the space of the door,

104
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:50,109
the trace of the bullet on the sofa that was beyond the corpse.

105
00:06:57,109 --> 00:07:02,809
I somehow convinced her run through the corridor,

106
00:07:02,809 --> 00:07:05,409
but I wonder if there was any meaning to it?

107
00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:09,109
I'll go show the children the movie I took anyway!

108
00:07:09,109 --> 00:07:10,109
Okay!

109
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:16,109
Hey! Are you listening, kid?

110
00:07:16,109 --> 00:07:17,909
Hey?

111
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:04,009
Who are you?

112
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:09,409
I'm asking you, who are you?

113
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:13,109
You haven't changed.

114
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:17,309
Masumi...

115
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:20,479
Shu...

116
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,709
Big Brother Shu?

117
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:33,909
Are you really Big Brother Shu?

118
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:35,009
But, why?

119
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:36,809
I heard that you died, Big Brother Shu...

120
00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:42,909
I wanted to hear that from you.

121
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,503
Is something the matter?

122
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:46,109
No need to worry.

123
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,309
My little sister's anemic.

124
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:50,509
Oh, is that so...

125
00:08:56,109 --> 00:08:59,509
"Proceed with the plan. Obstacle taken care of."

126
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:14,554
What's the problem?

127
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,954
Why did you call us out to the corridor?

128
00:09:16,954 --> 00:09:19,154
It seems they've come up with something.

129
00:09:19,154 --> 00:09:22,554
Oh, no. We're still in the midst of investigation.

130
00:09:22,554 --> 00:09:25,454
But, that boy came to get us.

131
00:09:25,454 --> 00:09:26,954
He said that you'd be starting

132
00:09:26,954 --> 00:09:30,054
the Sleeping Kogoro Deduction Show.

133
00:09:30,054 --> 00:09:33,054
But, you said so, right, Pops?

134
00:09:33,054 --> 00:09:35,854
That you've figured out what went on!

135
00:09:35,854 --> 00:09:39,354
Idiot! I was just speaking of an example.

136
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,554
It's come!

137
00:09:49,554 --> 00:09:51,254
The Sleeping Kogoro!

138
00:09:51,254 --> 00:09:54,954
Now that Mr. Mouri's taken that pose.

139
00:09:54,954 --> 00:09:57,654
He's solved the case.

140
00:09:57,654 --> 00:09:59,854
The truth of the locked room murder

141
00:09:59,854 --> 00:10:02,581
that was committed in room B.

142
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:04,154
Who are you?

143
00:10:04,154 --> 00:10:06,354
Oh, I'm sorry,

144
00:10:06,354 --> 00:10:10,054
I'm Mr. Mouri's number one disciple, Amuro.

145
00:10:10,054 --> 00:10:13,054
Ai's not there?

146
00:10:13,054 --> 00:10:14,354
No.

147
00:10:14,354 --> 00:10:17,754
I looked in the restrooms of the cars nearby too, but...

148
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:23,054
Oh, it's mail from Ai.

149
00:10:23,054 --> 00:10:26,354
I'm okay so don't worry about me.

150
00:10:26,354 --> 00:10:27,954
That's what's written.

151
00:10:27,954 --> 00:10:31,254
It's definitely Ai's mail address, but...

152
00:10:31,254 --> 00:10:33,954
Maybe she's with Conan?

153
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:35,354
I'm sure!

154
00:10:35,354 --> 00:10:37,754
We wanted to go there too, right?

155
00:10:37,754 --> 00:10:41,454
If she did, she should've said so first!

156
00:10:45,154 --> 00:10:48,054
Right. The locked room murder...

157
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:50,054
That mystery was solved

158
00:10:50,054 --> 00:10:53,454
the second time we visited Ms. Idenami's room E.

159
00:10:53,454 --> 00:10:55,254
Hey, what's this about?

160
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,454
Are you saying that I'm the culprit?

161
00:10:57,454 --> 00:10:59,954
I realized after I looked into your room

162
00:10:59,954 --> 00:11:03,654
from the space between the chain locked door of your room.

163
00:11:03,654 --> 00:11:05,754
If the door is chain locked,

164
00:11:05,754 --> 00:11:07,654
no matter how much we look inside,

165
00:11:07,654 --> 00:11:10,649
we can't possibly see the sofa that's on the other side!

166
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:15,354
But, when Conan found Mr. Murobashi's body in room B,

167
00:11:15,354 --> 00:11:18,154
despite the door having been chain locked,

168
00:11:18,154 --> 00:11:21,654
he said that the sofa to the right was in view.

169
00:11:21,654 --> 00:11:24,663
Maybe that boy mistook what he saw?

170
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:26,665
That's probably...

171
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,667
because that room's chain lock

172
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:32,454
had more number of loops than the other rooms, no?

173
00:11:32,454 --> 00:11:34,673
Therefore, the space between the door opened wider.

174
00:11:34,854 --> 00:11:36,354
So, the range of vision that could be seen from outside

175
00:11:36,354 --> 00:11:38,054
also expanded!

176
00:11:38,054 --> 00:11:40,954
Is that a problem?

177
00:11:40,954 --> 00:11:42,681
A great problem.

178
00:11:42,854 --> 00:11:44,683
A chain lock is usually made

179
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:46,685
so that even if a hand were to be inserted

180
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:48,687
between the door from outside,

181
00:11:48,854 --> 00:11:50,689
it cannot be opened, but...

182
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:53,754
If there is one chain loop more, making the chain longer,

183
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,154
it would be possible to lock the room

184
00:11:55,154 --> 00:11:57,354
even after leaving the room, you see.

185
00:12:03,654 --> 00:12:04,703
Oh, hey!

186
00:12:04,954 --> 00:12:07,654
No! You can't look at the name list!

187
00:12:07,654 --> 00:12:09,054
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:09,054 --> 00:12:12,711
I thought I saw an acquaintance on board, you see.

189
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:15,854
Please call me, if you need such information!

190
00:12:15,854 --> 00:12:17,354
Excuse me.

191
00:12:27,054 --> 00:12:29,254
There are six, as you say!

192
00:12:29,254 --> 00:12:31,354
The chains of the other rooms only have five loops

193
00:12:31,354 --> 00:12:33,654
but only the chain of room B here has six loops!

194
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:36,735
So, the locked room mystery has been solved.

195
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,354
But, if someone were to be doing something by the doorway,

196
00:12:39,354 --> 00:12:41,454
wouldn't the conductor have noticed?

197
00:12:41,454 --> 00:12:42,741
That 's true.

198
00:12:42,954 --> 00:12:45,654
And he said he was in the corridor the whole time.

199
00:12:45,654 --> 00:12:47,754
I did see somebody who was looking this way

200
00:12:47,754 --> 00:12:49,354
through the door, though.

201
00:12:49,354 --> 00:12:51,854
Hey! Who was that?

202
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,254
I didn't have a good view.

203
00:12:54,254 --> 00:12:56,755
We were in the tunnel and it was dimly lit too.

204
00:12:56,954 --> 00:12:59,554
Then, that person must be the culprit

205
00:12:59,554 --> 00:13:01,554
who fled to another car.

206
00:13:01,554 --> 00:13:03,854
Someone from the outside could've committed the crime.

207
00:13:03,854 --> 00:13:05,854
Since the conductors who knew our faces

208
00:13:05,854 --> 00:13:07,354
were in the corridor,

209
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:08,767
none of us in this first class car

210
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:11,354
would've committed such a crime.

211
00:13:11,354 --> 00:13:13,554
But, if that risk were to be worth taking

212
00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:15,754
because of this sound, then what?

213
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:16,775
Huh?

214
00:13:19,054 --> 00:13:21,254
This is the call bell.

215
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:23,054
But who on earth?

216
00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:24,354
Me!

217
00:13:26,554 --> 00:13:29,354
I played the sound of the bell of room B that I rang

218
00:13:29,354 --> 00:13:31,554
and recorded in my cell phone a while ago!

219
00:13:31,554 --> 00:13:33,854
You heard the bell ringing,

220
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,854
but none of the lamps were lit,

221
00:13:35,854 --> 00:13:37,454
so you went to room A, right?

222
00:13:37,454 --> 00:13:40,799
Yeah! Because the bulb for room A was burnt out.

223
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:44,054
That's why I thought that Mr. Noto was calling.

224
00:13:44,054 --> 00:13:46,805
That's why Mr. Murobashi of room B

225
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:48,807
was looking out of his room,

226
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:50,809
watching the conductor and Mr. Noto

227
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:52,254
arguing with each other, right?

228
00:13:52,254 --> 00:13:53,854
Yeah.

229
00:13:53,854 --> 00:13:56,054
He was on the phone with someone, though.

230
00:13:56,054 --> 00:13:58,817
I see. It was back then, wasn't it,

231
00:13:59,054 --> 00:14:01,554
that the culprit entered room B?

232
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:02,821
The corridors on this train

233
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:04,254
are narrow enough that opening a door

234
00:14:04,254 --> 00:14:06,825
blocks most of the passageway.

235
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:08,827
If the door of room B were opened,

236
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:12,254
the figure of the culprit coming from the other side of the door

237
00:14:12,254 --> 00:14:14,054
wouldn't be visible from the conductor

238
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,554
who is in front of room A.

239
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:16,854
Yes.

240
00:14:16,854 --> 00:14:18,837
I'm sure that the culprit called Mr. Murobashi and asked him

241
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:20,839
if anything was wrong

242
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:23,854
because there was a commotion outside.

243
00:14:23,854 --> 00:14:26,854
Moreover, it was when the train was inside the tunnel.

244
00:14:26,854 --> 00:14:28,847
If the culprit called Mr. Murobashi

245
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:30,849
just before the train entered the tunnel,

246
00:14:31,054 --> 00:14:32,354
and what if the culprit who was on the phone

247
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:33,854
were to come to room B

248
00:14:33,854 --> 00:14:35,854
saying that the reception is bad,

249
00:14:35,854 --> 00:14:37,554
so they'll continue the talk in the room.

250
00:14:37,554 --> 00:14:39,954
This is also a thinkable circumstance.

251
00:14:39,954 --> 00:14:43,454
But, what did the culprit talk to Mr. Murobashi about?

252
00:14:43,454 --> 00:14:45,954
About the deduction quiz that is being conducted

253
00:14:45,954 --> 00:14:49,354
on board the mystery train.

254
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:51,554
The culprit passes out fake instruction cards

255
00:14:51,554 --> 00:14:53,554
designating Mr. Murobashi to play the role of the victim,

256
00:14:53,554 --> 00:14:55,454
the culprit to act as the culprit,

257
00:14:55,454 --> 00:14:57,254
and my daughter and her friend

258
00:14:57,254 --> 00:15:00,454
to play the role of accomplices.

259
00:15:00,454 --> 00:15:03,554
He made the girls and Mr. Murobashi switch rooms

260
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:07,854
saying that it was to carry out the missing body trick.

261
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:10,889
Of course, Mr. Murobashi would've reserved

262
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:13,654
room B of the first class car this time too,

263
00:15:13,654 --> 00:15:16,054
so that instruction card was something that was prepared

264
00:15:16,054 --> 00:15:17,754
to deal with any trouble that may come up.

265
00:15:17,754 --> 00:15:19,354
And just to be safe, he chose the children

266
00:15:19,354 --> 00:15:21,754
to play the part of detective.

267
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,854
If someone playing the role of the detective

268
00:15:23,854 --> 00:15:26,154
comes to room B of car number 7,

269
00:15:26,154 --> 00:15:29,354
the girls would have to stay in that room for a while

270
00:15:29,354 --> 00:15:32,454
in order to play the role of accomplices.

271
00:15:32,454 --> 00:15:33,954
Although it looks to be

272
00:15:33,954 --> 00:15:35,854
that the trick was seen through right away,

273
00:15:35,854 --> 00:15:38,054
and the girls and the children returned to room B in first class

274
00:15:38,054 --> 00:15:40,554
where the murder was committed.

275
00:15:40,554 --> 00:15:42,921
And? I understand up to the point

276
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:46,054
where the culprit moved Mr. Murobashi to room B,

277
00:15:46,054 --> 00:15:47,454
but when did the culprit come out?

278
00:15:47,454 --> 00:15:50,254
Right! If the culprit killed him after entering room B,

279
00:15:50,254 --> 00:15:52,154
and came out immediately,

280
00:15:52,154 --> 00:15:53,554
then the conductor who was in front of room A

281
00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:54,933
would've seen something, right?

282
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:56,654
But, he didn't see anything.

283
00:15:56,654 --> 00:15:59,854
If so, the one to be suspected is the one

284
00:15:59,854 --> 00:16:02,654
who was looking out through the door that the conductor saw...

285
00:16:02,654 --> 00:16:04,454
Which door was it?

286
00:16:04,454 --> 00:16:07,854
The door to the very end of the corridor.

287
00:16:07,854 --> 00:16:10,154
I saw it when I was in front of room E.

288
00:16:10,154 --> 00:16:12,654
I think it was Mr. Noto's room A.

289
00:16:12,654 --> 00:16:13,654
Hey!

290
00:16:13,654 --> 00:16:15,454
Cut out the unreliable talk!

291
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:19,554
I know the identity of that person!

292
00:16:19,554 --> 00:16:21,554
That's you...

293
00:16:21,554 --> 00:16:22,961
Conductor!

294
00:16:25,754 --> 00:16:27,954
Me, the suspicious character?

295
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,654
I'm the culprit?

296
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:30,754
No.

297
00:16:30,754 --> 00:16:36,554
What you saw was yourself in front of room E...

298
00:16:37,254 --> 00:16:39,854
A mirror. Correct?

299
00:16:40,454 --> 00:16:42,254
Exactly!

300
00:16:42,654 --> 00:16:44,983
The culprit had placed mirrors entirely

301
00:16:45,154 --> 00:16:47,454
onto the inside of the door of his room,

302
00:16:47,454 --> 00:16:49,654
and when the conductor, called by Ms. Idenami

303
00:16:49,654 --> 00:16:51,554
came in front of room E,

304
00:16:51,554 --> 00:16:54,254
the culprit opened the door of his room

305
00:16:54,254 --> 00:16:56,754
so that the conductor wouldn't see him coming out of room B.

306
00:16:56,754 --> 00:17:00,154
But, if the culprit was in room B at that time,

307
00:17:00,154 --> 00:17:03,001
how did the culprit open the door to his room?

308
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:05,003
He tied a fishing line to the door knob

309
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:07,454
and pulled it through the railing of the corridor window,

310
00:17:07,454 --> 00:17:09,754
then pulled it into room B.

311
00:17:09,754 --> 00:17:11,009
He then after waiting for the right time,

312
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:14,254
pulled the line and opened the door.

313
00:17:14,254 --> 00:17:15,354
Yes.

314
00:17:15,354 --> 00:17:17,015
This trick

315
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:18,754
will not work if the mirror is positioned

316
00:17:18,754 --> 00:17:20,254
too close or too far.

317
00:17:20,254 --> 00:17:24,254
Which means that, out of the rooms A, B, C, D and E,

318
00:17:24,254 --> 00:17:25,354
the passenger staying in the room

319
00:17:25,354 --> 00:17:27,754
right in the middle, in room C.

320
00:17:27,754 --> 00:17:33,031
Mr. Ando, is the only one who could've carried this out!

321
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,554
Strange.

322
00:17:37,554 --> 00:17:40,154
I can't get through to Ai, Conan, Dad

323
00:17:40,154 --> 00:17:43,041
and even Sera on the phone.

324
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,554
I wonder what's going on?

325
00:17:46,454 --> 00:17:48,754
I'm going over to check out the first class car after all!

326
00:17:48,754 --> 00:17:51,054
Oh, hey!

327
00:17:51,054 --> 00:17:54,154
They seem to be right in the middle of the deduction show now,

328
00:17:54,154 --> 00:17:57,354
so I don't think you should intrude.

329
00:18:02,254 --> 00:18:04,354
Mirror?

330
00:18:04,354 --> 00:18:06,754
Just how am I supposed to have carried a large mirror

331
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:10,454
big enough to cover the entire door onto this train?

332
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:14,154
That picture that you said you were asked to appraise.

333
00:18:14,154 --> 00:18:16,354
If you stick about three mirrors

334
00:18:16,354 --> 00:18:19,077
between the canvases of that picture,

335
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:22,054
it seems to be just enough to cover the entire door.

336
00:18:22,054 --> 00:18:24,854
That picture was very heavy too.

337
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,085
The frame of the picture is pure gold.

338
00:18:27,254 --> 00:18:31,089
No, it's a gold plated wooden frame.

339
00:18:32,054 --> 00:18:33,554
What's heavy is the picture...

340
00:18:33,554 --> 00:18:36,654
Inside the picture, just as Mr. Mouri said...

341
00:18:39,254 --> 00:18:41,754
are three mirrors...

342
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:43,754
Judging from the fact that one mirror

343
00:18:43,754 --> 00:18:46,254
is painted with the same color as the door.

344
00:18:46,254 --> 00:18:47,954
The mirror seems to have been rigged

345
00:18:47,954 --> 00:18:49,954
so that it wouldn't look like one.

346
00:18:49,954 --> 00:18:52,254
Because if left as is, the sign on the door

347
00:18:52,254 --> 00:18:56,854
designating room E would reflect on the mirror.

348
00:18:56,854 --> 00:18:58,754
So, Mr. Ando,

349
00:18:58,754 --> 00:19:02,654
how do you plan to explain the three mirrors?

350
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:07,125
Please don't say that the mirrors were there to begin with

351
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,754
before you were asked to appraise it,

352
00:19:08,754 --> 00:19:11,154
and you didn't realize that

353
00:19:11,154 --> 00:19:13,654
the picture was abnormally heavy.

354
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:16,254
If need be, we could ask the client

355
00:19:16,254 --> 00:19:19,954
who asked you to appraise the picture.

356
00:19:19,954 --> 00:19:24,254
That is, if there really is such a person.

357
00:19:40,454 --> 00:19:42,954
My. How dare you?

358
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:47,554
It was my favorite, you know?

359
00:19:50,254 --> 00:19:53,171
The one piece that I put into that trunk.

360
00:19:55,354 --> 00:20:01,179
Why don't you stop doing things like this already?

361
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:02,554
Sharon?

362
00:20:10,254 --> 00:20:11,954
Nobody would've guessed.

363
00:20:11,954 --> 00:20:15,193
That the boy would get you, his mother,

364
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:17,854
involved in our battle.

365
00:20:17,854 --> 00:20:19,854
I was the one who initiated it.

366
00:20:19,854 --> 00:20:22,054
If he is the star of the silver screen,

367
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:26,754
I told him to cast the legendary actress of Japan, me!

368
00:20:26,754 --> 00:20:28,754
But, how disappointing.

369
00:20:28,754 --> 00:20:31,554
I was hoping to learn how to use make-up

370
00:20:31,554 --> 00:20:34,354
to keep glowing even after aging.

371
00:20:34,354 --> 00:20:36,154
However, to find that the great actress

372
00:20:36,154 --> 00:20:38,954
Sharon Vineyard was just wearing an old lady's make-up.

373
00:20:38,954 --> 00:20:42,054
Oh... It's actually pretty painstaking, you know?

374
00:20:42,054 --> 00:20:44,954
To routinely act as if I'm old.

375
00:20:44,954 --> 00:20:47,225
Never mind that, but the remark that you made

376
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:49,654
when we passed each other in the corridor.

377
00:20:49,654 --> 00:20:52,254
If we outdo you,

378
00:20:52,254 --> 00:20:55,854
you'll promise to back away from her once and for all...

379
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,954
Just what did you mean by that?

380
00:20:57,954 --> 00:21:00,354
Just exactly that.

381
00:21:00,354 --> 00:21:04,854
According to Shinichi, Ai is already on our side.

382
00:21:04,854 --> 00:21:07,954
How stupid.

383
00:21:07,954 --> 00:21:10,554
Do you actually think you can outdo us?

384
00:21:10,554 --> 00:21:11,854
Did you know?

385
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:15,253
That Shinichi's team is a step ahead right now?

386
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:16,554
A step ahead?

387
00:21:17,054 --> 00:21:19,254
That girl called Sera who passed out in your room

388
00:21:19,254 --> 00:21:21,254
and was left sleeping,

389
00:21:21,254 --> 00:21:24,354
has already been carried back to her previous room.

390
00:21:24,354 --> 00:21:27,554
You work quickly, don't you?

391
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:29,054
But, how strange.

392
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,654
The boy's in the midst of the deduction show.

393
00:21:31,654 --> 00:21:34,354
I wonder if he has other people to help him?

394
00:21:34,354 --> 00:21:36,954
Beats me. I wonder?

395
00:21:36,954 --> 00:21:40,954
We could have a special guest on our side, you know.

396
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:03,301
Big Brother Shu.

397
00:22:04,554 --> 00:22:06,754
Big Brother Shu.

398
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,464
Next Conan's Hint:

399
00:23:48,464 --> 00:23:50,856
"Top-notch Casting"

400
00:23:50,856 --> 00:23:53,180
-Gin. Vodka. Bourbon. -What?

401
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,340
The names of the liquor that Pops Mouri

402
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,680
-drank in chronological order. -What?
