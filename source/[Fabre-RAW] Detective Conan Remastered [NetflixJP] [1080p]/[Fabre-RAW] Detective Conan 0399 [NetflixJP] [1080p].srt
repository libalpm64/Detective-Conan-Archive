1
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,460
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,160
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,560
Sense of vision, hearing and smell.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,060
An alibi relying on these three senses.

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,860
The clue to invalidating the alibi is a past incident!

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,460
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,960
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,360
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:03,429
"Request from a Queer Family (Part 2)"

10
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:05,729
In other words, the suspects are...

11
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:09,129
Daisaku, the family head that confined in his room blowing the flute,

12
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,229
Tsugutaka, the oldest son who was illustrating

13
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:16,229
and the second son, Shigehide who was writing a novel.

14
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:17,929
These three men.

15
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,129
No. Up to now,

16
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:23,029
all the deductions were made based on Conan leading everyone to them.

17
00:02:23,029 --> 00:02:25,429
It's as if the thoughts that cross an innocent child's mind

18
00:02:25,429 --> 00:02:28,729
coincidentally serve as hints to reach a conclusion,

19
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:29,729
but it can only be done

20
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:33,529
because he is secretly having Shinichi make the deductions.

21
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:34,629
Even up to now,

22
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:38,829
I've never seen him making phone calls before coming up with an idea.

23
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:41,629
If so, there is only one thing I can think of.

24
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:42,829
That this child...

25
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,129
Conan himself...

26
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:46,729
is Shinichi.

27
00:02:48,529 --> 00:02:51,729
That's why all the calls from Shinichi come in with no number display.

28
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:54,229
So that I can't call him from my side.

29
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:58,029
But during the school festival, they were both together.

30
00:02:58,029 --> 00:03:00,129
Am I taking my imagination too far after all?

31
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:03,229
No, don't be deceived!

32
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:06,429
I'm sure Shinichi used some kind of trick!

33
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:08,329
What's the matter, Ran?

34
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:10,329
No, it's nothing.

35
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:11,729
I see.

36
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:13,429
I've got to make sure.

37
00:03:13,429 --> 00:03:16,529
Come to think of it, right after I sent the mail to Shinichi,

38
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,329
Conan's cell phone...

39
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:21,929
I'm going to send that mail once more.

40
00:03:21,929 --> 00:03:23,229
And this time for sure...

41
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:28,029
I'll get hold of conclusive evidence that he can't get away with.

42
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,529
No way.

43
00:03:33,529 --> 00:03:35,329
It's not responding.

44
00:03:36,929 --> 00:03:38,029
A visitor?

45
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:39,529
Were you expecting somebody?

46
00:03:39,529 --> 00:03:41,329
No.

47
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:43,329
It says my mail's been sent.

48
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:45,329
So what happened this morning was a coincidence after all?

49
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:46,529
Well, I guess so.

50
00:03:46,529 --> 00:03:49,129
Conan couldn't possibly be Shinichi.

51
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,529
No, it's Shinichi!

52
00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:53,029
He could be using some method

53
00:03:53,029 --> 00:03:55,429
that is unthinkable for ordinary people to think up.

54
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:57,129
If you're going to be that way,

55
00:03:57,129 --> 00:03:58,629
I'm not going to take my eyes off you,

56
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:01,029
not even for an instant, until you expose yourself.

57
00:04:01,029 --> 00:04:03,629
So, you'd better be ready, Shinichi!

58
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:07,529
I wonder if it's just another prank?

59
00:04:07,529 --> 00:04:08,529
A prank?

60
00:04:08,529 --> 00:04:11,629
There are times when the doorbell rings, but there's no one there.

61
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:14,929
But it's really bad today. It's already happened several times.

62
00:04:14,929 --> 00:04:17,029
It usually happens only once a week.

63
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:20,829
But it's already this time of day to be a prank by children.

64
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:25,029
One of the three probably rang the door chime using some method,

65
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:28,529
and rigged up some alibi trick while the door was being answered.

66
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:30,529
It's true that the alibi of the three

67
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:33,129
is being supported by the housekeepers who brought their dinner

68
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:36,629
during the time of the crime, which was around 7:30.

69
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:39,529
But they did not directly see any of the three.

70
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:43,529
If so, the most suspicious would be Tsugutaka,

71
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:45,229
the husband of Tomoko who had been killed.

72
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:47,129
If he saw the mail in her cell phone

73
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:49,729
that came from the one she was having an affair with,

74
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:51,229
that would be a motive, too.

75
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:53,529
If Mrs. Kariya was having an affair...

76
00:04:53,529 --> 00:04:56,729
I don't think Mr. Kariya would have overlooked it.

77
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,629
Why do you think so?

78
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:02,829
12 years ago when Eisuke, his third son's fiance

79
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:05,429
was killed in the phone booth,

80
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:07,429
they were actually on a date.

81
00:05:07,429 --> 00:05:10,929
The first phone call was from Eisuke asking him if it was okay

82
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:14,329
to let Motoka spend the night over because she had missed the last train.

83
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:16,529
Mr. Kariya who was in the living room

84
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:18,629
asked for Motoka to come on the phone.

85
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:23,229
If a girl like you ever dare come through the door of the Kariya residence,

86
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:24,929
I'll see to it that you do not live!

87
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:28,029
Was Motoka also having an affair?

88
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:31,429
I don't know how Mr. Kariya found out, but...

89
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:33,929
I think they both stayed at the phone booth

90
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:36,429
without being able to make it home and was killed there.

91
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:38,429
Was the police notified?

92
00:05:38,429 --> 00:05:40,829
I only know that there was a phone call.

93
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:43,629
Shigehide told us that it had nothing to do with the case,

94
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:45,129
so that it wasn't necessary to report it.

95
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:47,329
Which means that the only person

96
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:50,029
that had nothing to do with Tomoko was Shigehide.

97
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:52,029
About that...

98
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:57,629
We heard Tomoko and Shigehide arguing in the corridor a month ago.

99
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:00,029
Something about "It's terrible to eavesdrop."

100
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:02,029
It was about the dialogue of the parents of the main character

101
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,029
that appear in the novel which is to be dramatized soon...

102
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:06,729
Being very similar to their own.

103
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:10,729
Mrs. Kariya was outraged saying that if the dialogue is not changed

104
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:12,329
before the dramatization, she would sue him.

105
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:14,629
As a result, Shigehide agreed to change the dialogue

106
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:17,629
and everything seems to have been settled.

107
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:20,629
What? You're all still here?

108
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:22,429
Did you find the killer?

109
00:06:22,429 --> 00:06:24,629
Oh, not yet.

110
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:28,129
By the way, at around 7:30 when your dinner was delivered to you,

111
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:29,529
you answered through the sliding paper door,

112
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:32,729
"It's been a long time since we had curry for dinner."

113
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:34,729
But how did you know it was curry?

114
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:38,229
The aroma. The sliding door was slightly opened.

115
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:40,729
What's this used for?

116
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:44,629
I use it to listen to my flute teacher play and practice.

117
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:46,729
I'm making process day by day.

118
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:48,329
Now that I don't go out often,

119
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:51,229
playing the flute is my only favourite pastime.

120
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:57,229
So ever since he hurt his leg at work, he haven't gone out much.

121
00:06:57,229 --> 00:07:00,029
Yes, since he used to stay at home all the time,

122
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:03,529
he found out that his wife was having an affair with someone else,

123
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:05,129
and got a divorce.

124
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:10,429
I see. That's why he is very sensitive to extra-marital.

125
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:14,029
Curry was one of the dishes that his wife was good at.

126
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:16,529
That's why you didn't make curry too often?

127
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:18,629
Out of consideration for Mr. Kariya.

128
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:22,429
Yes, we were actually thinking of making beef stew.

129
00:07:22,429 --> 00:07:25,129
But we decided to change it to curry just 10 minutes before serving it.

130
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:27,429
Hey, come on! That's enough.

131
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:31,329
I just told you that I was in this room at night around 7:30!

132
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:35,229
When you were served dinner, you raised your hand and responded.

133
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:37,829
She saw your silhouette through the sliding paper door

134
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:39,729
but she didn't actually see you in person.

135
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:41,029
You mean you think I rigged it so that my silhouette

136
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:42,829
would be reflected on the paper door?

137
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:43,929
No.

138
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:45,829
I don't think that's possible.

139
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:47,629
I can tell whether it is actually the silhouette of a person or not.

140
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:48,829
I see.

141
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:52,029
So now that you're done, go on home, will you?

142
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:55,229
Thanks to you police people, I haven't been able concentrate,

143
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:57,529
and haven't made any progress in my work!

144
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:00,429
One of his family members has died

145
00:08:00,429 --> 00:08:02,629
and yet he doesn't shed a tear at all.

146
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:05,229
It's a wonder he's a writer of pure love novels.

147
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:06,829
He sure doesn't look to be one.

148
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:08,029
Talking about not looking to be one,

149
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,129
when we first met them you were saying...

150
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:12,129
Hey, Ran?

151
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:13,329
What?

152
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:17,029
You were saying that you thought he was much older.

153
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:22,029
That's because the people who come out in his novels don't dye their hair.

154
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:25,729
Even if people with dyed hair come out, they're treated as delinquents.

155
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:27,929
That's why I thought he was pretty old.

156
00:08:27,929 --> 00:08:29,129
Besides,

157
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:31,729
his story usually has scenes in which the main characters are at the place

158
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:34,129
they're supposed to meet, and yet, they don't get to see each other

159
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:36,429
because a pillar is in the way. Just like in some old movie.

160
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:38,929
It's so sad watching the characters waiting and worrying,

161
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:42,229
concerned about their loved ones that don't show up.

162
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:44,129
They're so different from somebody I know,

163
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:47,829
that's always close by, yet insists on secretly watching his partner.

164
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:51,529
You think so too, don't you, Conan?

165
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:54,929
I can't really tell because I'm just a child.

166
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:56,229
You think so, don't you?

167
00:08:56,229 --> 00:08:57,329
Yes.

168
00:08:58,629 --> 00:08:59,929
Enough.

169
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:03,229
I have nothing more to say than that I was here, right through.

170
00:09:03,229 --> 00:09:07,129
But smelling the aroma of the pipe when dinner was brought here

171
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,429
is not enough to serve as proof of an alibi.

172
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:11,129
Then who was smoking the pipe?

173
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:13,029
Are you saying that there was Ninja or something around?

174
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:14,229
A Ninja?

175
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:17,229
You ate the curry.

176
00:09:18,229 --> 00:09:20,329
By the way, did somebody come again?

177
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:22,129
I heard the doorbell ring a while ago.

178
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:25,029
No. It seems that somebody played a prank again.

179
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:31,329
I think that Tsugutaka is quite upset over this prank.

180
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:33,729
Each time he returned from outside,

181
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:36,429
he used to ask if any pranks were played.

182
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:39,629
When we told him there were, he used to get into a foul mood.

183
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:43,429
And he used to get really upset over crank calls, too.

184
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:44,429
Crank calls?

185
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:46,629
Yes, it rings once, and hangs up.

186
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:50,129
It rings for some time and then hangs up. We were getting strange calls.

187
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:51,629
We got a one today, too.

188
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:54,129
When you came, a little after 8:00.

189
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:55,429
Was it an undisplayed number?

190
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,729
No, the thing is...

191
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:57,929
Although the phone call came in

192
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:00,229
it wasn't displayed in the incoming call history.

193
00:10:00,229 --> 00:10:02,229
Don't tell me that the chime we heard just a while ago?

194
00:10:02,229 --> 00:10:03,629
Hey, Ran!

195
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:05,029
What?

196
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:07,429
You sent mail out a while ago, didn't you?

197
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:08,429
You did, didn't you?

198
00:10:09,429 --> 00:10:10,429
Yes, I did!

199
00:10:10,429 --> 00:10:11,729
Is that wrong?

200
00:10:11,729 --> 00:10:13,629
Did you verify the address?

201
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:17,229
I didn't have to verify it because all I did was re-send the mail

202
00:10:17,229 --> 00:10:18,629
I sent out this morning.

203
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:20,529
Oh, no.

204
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:22,429
Who did I mail this out to?

205
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:24,129
Just as I thought after all.

206
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:27,129
That's why she found the cell phone so easily.

207
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:29,929
Which means that person is the killer.

208
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,429
The killer used the case of 12 years ago

209
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:33,529
to hide his shadow within the dark.

210
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:37,829
So that he alone could continue to stay in the light.

211
00:10:44,272 --> 00:10:47,072
I guess it's about time we call it a day then.

212
00:10:47,072 --> 00:10:48,072
Yes.

213
00:10:48,072 --> 00:10:49,272
I think it'll be difficult to undo their alibi

214
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:51,872
unless we use some sort of magic.

215
00:10:51,872 --> 00:10:53,472
Magic?

216
00:10:53,472 --> 00:10:56,972
I saw a fantastic magic show on TV the other day!

217
00:10:58,172 --> 00:11:00,672
This lady is in a rectangular box.

218
00:11:00,672 --> 00:11:04,372
Her face, hands and legs are sticking out, but her body splits into three.

219
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,772
Talk about shocking!

220
00:11:07,072 --> 00:11:09,672
You idiot! There are three people in there.

221
00:11:09,672 --> 00:11:12,472
Really? I guess you can't deceive people carrying it out alone,

222
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:15,372
but if there are others to help you, it's possible!

223
00:11:15,372 --> 00:11:17,872
So what?

224
00:11:17,872 --> 00:11:22,972
If one of the three helps out, then the alibi trick will work?

225
00:11:22,972 --> 00:11:24,472
It's not possible,

226
00:11:24,472 --> 00:11:28,972
because the meals were delivered to three rooms that are apart.

227
00:11:30,372 --> 00:11:32,972
For some reason,

228
00:11:32,972 --> 00:11:35,372
Mrs. Kariya finds the cell phone that she had lost in the house,

229
00:11:35,372 --> 00:11:37,872
and as soon as she does so, she is killed.

230
00:11:37,872 --> 00:11:41,772
The three men who live in this house are to be suspected, that's for sure.

231
00:11:41,772 --> 00:11:45,972
Yes. The cell phone was also missing from the scene of the murder.

232
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:47,672
But, Ran...

233
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:49,472
Don't you think that the person who is hiding that cell phone

234
00:11:49,472 --> 00:11:52,172
-is really stupid? -Huh?

235
00:11:52,172 --> 00:11:54,472
Because while we were looking for the cell phone,

236
00:11:54,472 --> 00:11:56,272
no matter how many times we called,

237
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:58,772
the person kept answering and hanging up right away, right?

238
00:11:58,772 --> 00:12:00,272
Of course.

239
00:12:00,272 --> 00:12:03,472
Because once his voice is heard, it would be obvious who he is.

240
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,472
But if it were me,

241
00:12:04,472 --> 00:12:08,072
if I knew that such an in convenient phone call would be coming,

242
00:12:08,072 --> 00:12:10,172
I would switch off my cell phone.

243
00:12:11,872 --> 00:12:15,572
Which means that Shinichi did have his cell phone switched off?

244
00:12:15,572 --> 00:12:16,972
You idiot!

245
00:12:16,972 --> 00:12:20,972
He was waiting for Tomoko's man to call or mail her,

246
00:12:20,972 --> 00:12:22,772
that's why he didn't switch off her phone.

247
00:12:22,772 --> 00:12:26,472
If so, he could've adjusted the volume of her cell phone.

248
00:12:26,472 --> 00:12:29,872
Because he was getting repeated calls.

249
00:12:29,872 --> 00:12:34,072
Or, was it that he didn't know how to operate the phone?

250
00:12:34,072 --> 00:12:35,772
I'm sure he knew what he was doing

251
00:12:35,772 --> 00:12:37,872
because he knew how to unlock the cell phone.

252
00:12:37,872 --> 00:12:41,172
But even if the cell phone were to be locked, it would be obvious

253
00:12:41,172 --> 00:12:43,872
that four digits would have to be entered in order to unlock the phone.

254
00:12:43,872 --> 00:12:45,672
Therefore, even if the killer had no idea how to use the phone,

255
00:12:45,672 --> 00:12:48,672
so long as he had time, I'm sure he would've been able to unlock it.

256
00:12:48,672 --> 00:12:52,172
Anyone can find out how to use it by just touching it here and there.

257
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:54,372
It took me a while to get used to it though.

258
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:58,572
You're talking about back when you first bought your cell phone, right?

259
00:12:58,572 --> 00:13:01,872
Right, right. There aren't too many people who do not know

260
00:13:01,872 --> 00:13:03,672
how to use a cell phone in this day and age.

261
00:13:03,672 --> 00:13:06,972
If that person were to be locked up somewhere for about 10 years or so,

262
00:13:06,972 --> 00:13:08,272
then maybe...

263
00:13:08,272 --> 00:13:09,272
10 years?

264
00:13:09,272 --> 00:13:10,372
Come to think of it,

265
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,172
the use of cell phone became widespread about 10 years ago.

266
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:16,472
Hey, wasn't it about 12 years ago?

267
00:13:16,472 --> 00:13:18,172
That the third son Eisuke's fiance was killed

268
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,872
and his whereabouts became unknown?

269
00:13:20,872 --> 00:13:25,172
Could it have been Eisuke that had Tomoko's cell phone?

270
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:27,872
Don't tell me that he's somewhere in this house?

271
00:13:27,872 --> 00:13:31,872
Which means that one of the three was hiding him.

272
00:13:31,872 --> 00:13:33,172
It's understandable

273
00:13:33,172 --> 00:13:36,172
that after being separated from the outside world for 12 years,

274
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:40,272
he finds the cell phone and becomes interested in it, and takes it away.

275
00:13:40,272 --> 00:13:41,772
It was after all,

276
00:13:41,772 --> 00:13:45,172
Eisuke's friend who got a call from the cell phone that was lost.

277
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:46,372
If it were him,

278
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:48,972
he probably had a lot of time to figure out how to unlock the phone.

279
00:13:48,972 --> 00:13:51,872
And when he went to return the phone, Tomoko found him,

280
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,872
so he killed her along with whoever was hiding him

281
00:13:53,872 --> 00:13:56,372
in order to keep her from talking.

282
00:13:56,372 --> 00:13:58,672
The alibi would become invalid.

283
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,672
Okay! Go get a search warrant.

284
00:14:01,672 --> 00:14:05,172
Eisuke could be the killer of the incident that happened 12 years ago.

285
00:14:05,172 --> 00:14:06,972
Yes, sir.

286
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:09,672
The problem is, who's sheltering him?

287
00:14:09,672 --> 00:14:12,472
I think the most suspicious is the head of the household, Daisaku.

288
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:14,672
There was a radio cassette recorder in his room, right?

289
00:14:14,672 --> 00:14:17,372
He probably recorded his voice,

290
00:14:17,372 --> 00:14:19,372
"It's been a long time since we had curry for dinner."

291
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:23,972
And at the time of the crime around 7:30, he made Eisuke

292
00:14:23,972 --> 00:14:27,672
that he was sheltering push the button in order to establish his alibi.

293
00:14:29,672 --> 00:14:31,772
I think I'm kind of hungry.

294
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:35,072
Would you like to have some curry? There's still some more left.

295
00:14:35,072 --> 00:14:38,372
No, it's okay. It was supposed to be beef stew, right?

296
00:14:38,372 --> 00:14:40,972
And you changed it to curry 10 minutes before you served it, right?

297
00:14:40,972 --> 00:14:43,272
-So, I'll bet it's not that good anyway. -10 minutes ago.

298
00:14:43,272 --> 00:14:45,172
Means about 7:20.

299
00:14:45,172 --> 00:14:49,172
It takes more than 20 minutes to the murder site from here.

300
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:54,372
He'll have to leave by a little after 7:00 to make it in time.

301
00:14:54,372 --> 00:14:57,772
Then it's Tsugutaka who was smoking his pipe in the room

302
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:58,872
and illustrating in his room.

303
00:14:58,872 --> 00:15:03,572
As for the aroma from the pipe, all he had to do was make Eisuke smoke it.

304
00:15:03,572 --> 00:15:07,072
Curry is my favourite, so maybe I'll have some after all.

305
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,072
Huh?

306
00:15:08,072 --> 00:15:10,872
In fact, I was thinking of taking the curry that was outside the man's room

307
00:15:10,872 --> 00:15:13,972
somewhere else and eat it.

308
00:15:14,972 --> 00:15:16,272
But I decided against it.

309
00:15:16,272 --> 00:15:17,972
Because if the plate of curry disappears,

310
00:15:17,972 --> 00:15:20,772
it'll be easy to figure out who ate the curry!

311
00:15:20,772 --> 00:15:22,072
Wait a second.

312
00:15:22,072 --> 00:15:25,972
If Tsugutaka made Eisuke stay in his room to serve his double,

313
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:28,772
why didn't he make him take the curry into his room?

314
00:15:28,772 --> 00:15:30,572
That would make it look more like he was in the room.

315
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:33,372
He probably couldn't come out

316
00:15:33,372 --> 00:15:35,772
because he's someone that shouldn't be around.

317
00:15:35,772 --> 00:15:39,772
Even so, Tsugutaka would've noticed the dish after coming back

318
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,772
from the murder site and would've taken it inside.

319
00:15:41,772 --> 00:15:43,672
If he left it outside his room,

320
00:15:43,672 --> 00:15:46,072
it would only give way to suspicion

321
00:15:46,072 --> 00:15:48,472
that he wasn't in his room during the time of the crime.

322
00:15:48,472 --> 00:15:52,772
Besides, Tsugutaka had eaten the curry after it had gotten cold.

323
00:15:52,772 --> 00:15:54,872
There is no reason why he wouldn't take it into his room.

324
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:56,772
If so, the remaining suspect would be

325
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:58,872
the one who was writing a novel in his room,

326
00:15:58,872 --> 00:16:01,372
Shigehide.

327
00:16:02,872 --> 00:16:05,772
I killed Tomoko?

328
00:16:05,772 --> 00:16:07,972
I'm sheltering my kid brother Eisuke?

329
00:16:07,972 --> 00:16:09,772
You've got to be kidding!

330
00:16:09,772 --> 00:16:13,372
But if so, everything falls into place.

331
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:17,672
You made Eisuke have his hair done like yours.

332
00:16:17,672 --> 00:16:19,572
Then you make him respond through the sliding paper door

333
00:16:19,572 --> 00:16:20,772
isn't all that difficult.

334
00:16:25,472 --> 00:16:26,972
Mr. Tsubouchi from the editing section.

335
00:16:26,972 --> 00:16:28,772
I'm sort of busy right now.

336
00:16:28,772 --> 00:16:31,172
Yes. I'll call you back.

337
00:16:31,172 --> 00:16:33,572
You're mean, aren't you, mister?

338
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:35,972
You use a cell phone,

339
00:16:35,972 --> 00:16:39,472
but you don't let the characters in your novel use it.

340
00:16:39,472 --> 00:16:42,072
Why don't you let them use it?

341
00:16:42,072 --> 00:16:44,972
It's not that you didn't know about cell phone, right?

342
00:16:44,972 --> 00:16:46,072
It can't be.

343
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:48,772
Were you making your kid brother write the novels?

344
00:16:48,772 --> 00:16:51,572
That's why there weren't too many people who dyed their hair in the novel.

345
00:16:51,572 --> 00:16:55,472
12 years ago, not too many people used to dye their hair yet.

346
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,672
Which means it's true

347
00:16:56,672 --> 00:17:00,272
that the conversation between Mr. and Mrs. Kariya were used, too.

348
00:17:00,272 --> 00:17:02,272
If he lives in the attic,

349
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:04,472
he'll be able to hear all the conversation that goes on in the house.

350
00:17:04,472 --> 00:17:05,972
Well, that's...

351
00:17:08,372 --> 00:17:09,372
It's enough already.

352
00:17:10,372 --> 00:17:12,172
It's enough,

353
00:17:12,172 --> 00:17:13,172
Shigehide.

354
00:17:14,172 --> 00:17:15,172
You're...

355
00:17:15,172 --> 00:17:18,472
Yes. I'm Eisuke Kariya, who killed my fiance 12 years ago

356
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:21,772
and was being protected by my older brother all this time.

357
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:25,272
Because of the words of my father that I heard back then through the phone.

358
00:17:25,272 --> 00:17:29,572
If a girl like you ever dare come through the door of the Kariya residence,

359
00:17:29,572 --> 00:17:31,072
I'll see to it that you do not live!

360
00:17:32,172 --> 00:17:36,172
We got into an argument, I lost my temper and killed Motoka.

361
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:38,672
I was planning to kill myself, too.

362
00:17:38,672 --> 00:17:42,472
But I was in shock and found myself at home when Shigehide found me.

363
00:17:42,472 --> 00:17:44,572
Shigehide, I'm in trouble, I killed Motoka.

364
00:17:44,572 --> 00:17:46,972
Don't worry! I'll work something out.

365
00:17:46,972 --> 00:17:48,972
And you've stayed in the attic ever since.

366
00:17:48,972 --> 00:17:51,972
Yes. I thought of turning myself in many times,

367
00:17:51,972 --> 00:17:53,372
but just couldn't find the courage to do so.

368
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,372
I had no intention of killing her.

369
00:17:56,672 --> 00:17:59,672
Then why did you hit her after you stabbed her?

370
00:17:59,672 --> 00:18:00,972
You hit her, didn't you?

371
00:18:00,972 --> 00:18:03,172
No. I only stabbed her.

372
00:18:04,272 --> 00:18:08,772
So it's you who killed Motoka 12 years ago.

373
00:18:08,772 --> 00:18:10,072
What the...

374
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:12,872
Wait! Why would Shigehide kill Motoka?

375
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:18,472
Maybe because he was the one who was having an affair with Motoka?

376
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,472
I see! If it's an affair within the same household.

377
00:18:21,472 --> 00:18:23,072
It's understandable that Daisuke who didn't go out often

378
00:18:23,072 --> 00:18:24,272
would find out about it, too.

379
00:18:24,272 --> 00:18:28,972
Yes. And you killed Tomoko who found out about it to shut her up.

380
00:18:28,972 --> 00:18:31,272
Using the same method you used 12 years ago.

381
00:18:31,272 --> 00:18:34,872
You figured if push came to shove, you would put all the blame on Eisuke.

382
00:18:34,872 --> 00:18:36,472
That's ridiculous.

383
00:18:36,472 --> 00:18:39,872
Shigehide protected me for the past 12 years.

384
00:18:39,872 --> 00:18:43,172
No. He protected you because if the police arrested you,

385
00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:44,972
everything would be disclosed!

386
00:18:44,972 --> 00:18:47,472
The fact is that, after you stabbed Motoka,

387
00:18:47,472 --> 00:18:50,572
he killed her with a finishing blow!

388
00:18:50,572 --> 00:18:52,372
That's not true, right?

389
00:18:52,372 --> 00:18:55,772
No. Why would I do something like that?

390
00:18:55,772 --> 00:18:58,072
I remember Mrs. Kariya saying

391
00:18:58,072 --> 00:19:00,472
that the ringtone of the cell phone was a strange one.

392
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,672
Shut up. Be quiet!

393
00:19:02,672 --> 00:19:04,472
If you want to set me up as the killer that badly,

394
00:19:04,472 --> 00:19:07,372
show me proof that I did it.

395
00:19:09,072 --> 00:19:10,072
Guests again?

396
00:19:10,072 --> 00:19:12,972
No, I think it's the sound for incoming mail.

397
00:19:14,072 --> 00:19:19,072
Mrs. Kariya disappeared while looking for the cell phone, remember?

398
00:19:19,072 --> 00:19:22,372
She had my cell phone at that time,

399
00:19:22,372 --> 00:19:25,172
so she sent mail to her cell phone repeatedly

400
00:19:25,172 --> 00:19:28,272
and found her cell phone with the sound of incoming mail.

401
00:19:28,272 --> 00:19:29,372
I see.

402
00:19:29,372 --> 00:19:32,572
No matter what button I pushed, I couldn't stop this sound.

403
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:35,472
I got all flustered when Tomoko showed up at the attic.

404
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:37,672
I was able to stop the sound of the cell phone, but...

405
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:44,872
The ringtone is the same as that of the Kariya family.

406
00:19:44,872 --> 00:19:47,272
I see. If left that way, no matter where in the house you are,

407
00:19:47,272 --> 00:19:50,272
you will have an excuse to leave. So you can answer the call or e-mails

408
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,772
from the one you're having an affair with.

409
00:19:53,772 --> 00:19:56,872
And the fact that the sound is ringing now

410
00:19:56,872 --> 00:19:59,372
means that the cell phone is somewhere in this room.

411
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:02,772
Shigehide, the cell phone that you took from the scene of the murder,

412
00:20:02,772 --> 00:20:05,372
Tomoko's cell phone.

413
00:20:09,372 --> 00:20:11,772
You should've thrown it away immediately.

414
00:20:11,772 --> 00:20:13,872
He was probably too scared to throw it away

415
00:20:13,872 --> 00:20:17,872
until he confirmed whether or not she told anybody about his kid brother.

416
00:20:17,872 --> 00:20:20,972
Well, the truth will come out as soon as we check out the fingerprints

417
00:20:20,972 --> 00:20:22,272
on the murder weapon and the blood on it.

418
00:20:22,272 --> 00:20:27,072
If only she didn't say what she did.

419
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:29,772
Where do you think I found this cell phone?

420
00:20:29,772 --> 00:20:33,172
Your very curious kid brother had it.

421
00:20:33,172 --> 00:20:36,272
The one inside the dark attic, made to write novels to past his time away,

422
00:20:36,272 --> 00:20:38,372
so that his older brother could get all the glory,

423
00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:41,172
that poor kid brother of yours.

424
00:20:41,172 --> 00:20:43,472
Okay. To start things off, give me 10,000,000 yen.

425
00:20:43,472 --> 00:20:47,372
We'll talk over the details thoroughly in a different place.

426
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:51,372
That's why you told me to write the novel here tonight and went out?

427
00:20:51,372 --> 00:20:53,872
Yes. 12 years ago, too.

428
00:20:53,872 --> 00:20:57,872
I first went to see if she was okay because she was stabbed.

429
00:20:57,872 --> 00:20:58,972
Her wound was not serious,

430
00:20:58,972 --> 00:21:01,172
so I was going to take her to the hospital. But...

431
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:03,472
Take responsibility, will you?

432
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:04,872
Take responsibility and get married to you?

433
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:06,172
You idiot!

434
00:21:06,172 --> 00:21:09,072
I would never marry into a house with such an old fart living there.

435
00:21:09,072 --> 00:21:10,672
Money!

436
00:21:10,672 --> 00:21:12,972
Now that things turned out the way they did,

437
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:14,472
I'm going to leech you till you die and suck you to the bones,

438
00:21:14,472 --> 00:21:16,072
so be prepared!

439
00:21:17,372 --> 00:21:18,572
Shigehide.

440
00:21:19,872 --> 00:21:21,672
I'm not worthy of being your brother.

441
00:21:21,672 --> 00:21:24,072
If you didn't have the writing talent you did,

442
00:21:24,072 --> 00:21:27,372
I probably would have killed you the first chance I had.

443
00:21:27,372 --> 00:21:28,872
Shigehide.

444
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:31,072
Well, I guess I didn't do so

445
00:21:31,072 --> 00:21:37,372
because I wanted to read the continuation of your novels.

446
00:23:04,672 --> 00:23:06,772
But what a queer family they were.

447
00:23:06,772 --> 00:23:07,872
You were really fantastic, Pops.

448
00:23:07,872 --> 00:23:09,572
You solved the case in no time at all!

449
00:23:09,572 --> 00:23:10,772
Well, it was really no big deal.

450
00:23:12,872 --> 00:23:14,472
You're fantastic yourself, Shinichi.

451
00:23:14,472 --> 00:23:17,372
Acting out as a slightly intelligent grade school child. How splendid.

452
00:23:17,372 --> 00:23:22,572
You're a big centre forward manipulating a small mid-fielder.

453
00:23:22,572 --> 00:23:26,872
A fantasista who sends accurate passes and leads the ball to the goal.

454
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,172
But why?

455
00:23:28,172 --> 00:23:29,872
Why are you doing this?

456
00:23:29,872 --> 00:23:32,372
Why won't you tell me the truth?

457
00:23:32,372 --> 00:23:34,572
I mean we're so close together.

458
00:23:34,572 --> 00:23:35,872
Why?

459
00:23:37,872 --> 00:23:39,272
We're finally home.

460
00:23:40,272 --> 00:23:41,572
Hurry up and get off!

461
00:23:41,572 --> 00:23:43,072
I've got to go return the car.

462
00:23:43,072 --> 00:23:44,072
Okay.

463
00:23:47,872 --> 00:23:49,572
Ran, hurry up.

464
00:23:50,572 --> 00:23:52,472
Make sure you have the bath ready!

465
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:34,099
Next Conan's Hint:

466
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:36,299
"The number plate of a car"

467
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:37,799
The next episode is the 400th episode!

468
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:41,103
-A new start in history for you, Conan. -Sure thing.
