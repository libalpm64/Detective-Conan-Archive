1
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,540
Koshien ball grounds, the dream and goal of all high school ball players.

2
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,940
The Japan summer high school ball game will start this morning.

3
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,440
This year, 4,146 schools have participated in the nationwide competition,

4
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,040
and 160,000 players have played.

5
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,540
Chosen from among the winners are 49 schools.

6
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,940
In the indoor training grounds on the side of the first base,

7
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:10,140
the players are waiting for the game to start.

8
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,340
Let's take a look at the regional champions.

9
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,340
Representing Okinawa, Okinawa Central High.

10
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,140
Representing Kagoshima Prefecture, Sakurajima High.

11
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,040

12
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,540

13
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,840
Representing Kumamoto Prefecture, Kumamoto High.

14
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,640
Representing Nagasaki Prefecture...

15
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,640
We will commence the Japan High School Baseball Tournament!

16
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,540
The players will make entry.

17
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,140
Following Tadohara High School is Oita's Meihou High.

18
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,840
This makes the third time Meihou has gotten this far in the tournament.

19
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,940
Representing Osaka. Here's Ogane High School.

20
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:19,040
They're getting a big cheer from the stands.

21
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,240
Now, we will move on to the player dedication.

22
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,040
Representing all players from Toyama Minami Vocational High School,

23
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
Captain Kawakami.

24
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,640
I pledge!

25
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,940
That we the players have come here with joy and admiration in our hearts

26
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,540
upon this great stage and will compete fair and square.

27
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,640
We will give it our best and display the results

28
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,940
of the of the training we went through

29
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,740
with the sportsmanship of fair play.

30
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,140
Representing all the players here, Toyama prefecture,

31
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,740
Toyama Minami Vocational High School Baseball Club,

32
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,040
Captain Tomoya Kawakami.

33
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,640
Koshien Stadium.

34
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,740
It's the place where the chosen high school ball players gather

35
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,340
from throughout the nation to compete using their skills and strength.

36
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,340
It is the pinnacle of one's goal.

37
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,040
It is a sanctuary where the goddess smiles on the champions,

38
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,640
as well as a fighting arena where the ball game is settled.

39
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,840
Yes.

40
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,240
Koshien Stadium sometimes entices the bewitched into unbelievable fate.

41
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,240
Here's a hot passionate suspense in this cold winter season.

42
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,940
Today's episode is a two hour special. Heiji also appears.

43
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,440
A difficult case on a grand stage.

44
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

45
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

46
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,940
His name is Detective Conan!

47
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,640
"High School Ball Game, Invisible Summer Devil"

48
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,940
On the same day of summer vacation,

49
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,440
the ball game finals and Takarazuka show were to take place.

50
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,440
In order to decide which we'd go to

51
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,040
Hattori and Kazuha will have a deduction match.

52
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,640
The case is one that Pops was asked to help out with.

53
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,840
The clue on hand are wooden blocks that the president

54
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,140
of the toy manufacturing company had left behind as a dying message.

55
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,140
Thanks to Hattori's subtle hint,

56
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,040
Kazuha solves the message.

57
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,140
However, it turns out that Heiji figures out who the real killer is

58
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,640
and wins the deduction match.

59
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,540
We can finally go to the Koshien Stadium.

60
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,940
Congratulations, Heiji.

61
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,940
Oh, shoot! I forgot.

62
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,540
Now, I have to practice the boola boola.

63
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,940
Kazuha, wait.

64
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:20,340
Kazuha, I can ask Hattori for you to go to the Takarazuka show.

65
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,340
You are the one who solved the mystery of the dying message.

66
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,540
You are actually half the winner, right?

67
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,540
Forget it.

68
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,140
What I really wanted to see

69
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,540
wasn't the Takarazuka show or the baseball game.

70
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:40,240
It was Heiji's smile that he shows when he solves a case.

71
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,140
It's the Koshien Stadium!

72
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:59,740
I'm sure that here, there and everywhere...

73
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,340
Yoko.

74
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,140
Yoko?

75
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,740
Konan High School is where the idol Yoko Okino used to go to.

76
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,040
Hey, we're not there yet?

77
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,340
Are you all right, Kudo?

78
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,940
I give up.

79
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,640
By the way, why do they call this Koshien Stadium?

80
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,040
Why not Hyogo Stadium or Kansai Stadium?

81
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,240
I think it would've been way better.

82
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,440
The year that Koshien Stadium was completed

83
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,940
was the first year of both ten signs zodiac and the Chinese zodiac.

84
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,840
It was the meeting of the monkey and the mouse

85
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,040
which comes around every 60 years.

86
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,940
So they thought it was a lucky year.

87
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,940
You sure know a lot. Don't you, Conan?

88
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,740
He knows nothing about baseball

89
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,540
and yet he's knowledgeable when it comes to things like these.

90
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,940
Well, I'm so sorry.

91
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,240
That's not all there is about Koshien Stadium.

92
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,940
The number of the stumps of the famous ivies growing here total 430,

93
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,840
and the dimension of the leaves total 8,000 mats.

94
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,640
Although it's an old stadium,

95
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,240
it has the capacity to hold a total of 53,000 people,

96
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,440
which is virtually equal to that of a large stadium

97
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,840
that the major leagues play at.

98
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,940
How about it? Fantastic, don't you think?

99
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,140
You're just as bad as I am.

100
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,040
It's going to start.

101
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,740
Let's do our best...

102
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,340
Top of the 1st inning,

103
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,340
position number 1 short, player Inoue is the first batter

104
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,740
for Ohgane High School.

105
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,840
Play ball!

106
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,840
Strike!

107
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,240
Strike two!

108
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,340
Strike three, batter out!

109
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,640
The starting pitcher, Sakuraba, struck out the first batter.

110
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,640
One out. The stands are cheering.

111
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,340
Sakuraba is a senior at Konan High School.

112
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,540
Here comes the windup and the second pitch.

113
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,580
-Strike! -Strike.

114
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,180
Ohgane High School's pitcher, Inao, with another fastball.

115
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,380
Here comes the second pitch.

116
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,980
Another strike.

117
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,880
Three strikes for Konan High School's batter.

118
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,880
Now...

119
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:48,080
Here comes the third pitch.

120
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,780
-Strike, batter out! -Three swings and an out.

121
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,280
Inao presses relentlessly with his trademark style.

122
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,380
Konan High School's third batter, Kikuchi is a senior.

123
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,880
The crowd is on their feet.

124
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,380
This being the Koushien finals, we'll see three matched consecutively.

125
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,080
And now, Kikuchi faces off against Inao.

126
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,280
And here comes the pitch.

127
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,780
-Strike! -Strike.

128
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,380
The pitcher and the catcher exchange signs.

129
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,280
And now, the second pitch.

130
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,380
-Strike two! -Strike.

131
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,580
Now, it's two strikes. Thanks to a mean curveball.

132
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,380
The next batter, Nagashima is on deck.

133
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,780
Strike, batter out!

134
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,980
Ohgane High School's Inao holds off Konan High School

135
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,080
with some aggressive pitching.

136
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,080
That's the end of the 1st,

137
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,880
as Ohgane High School and Konan High School switch up.

138
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,080
Konan High School's Sakuraba now takes the mound.

139
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,780
It is the top of the 2nd inning,

140
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,980
and center number 6 of Ohgane High School,

141
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,380
player Matsuda is the batter.

142
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,280
Strike!

143
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,980
Foul ball!

144
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,080
The finals are amazing.

145
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,280
Strike, batter out!

146
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,080
Number seven, third player Morita.

147
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,580
Strike, batter out!

148
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,580
Sakuraba gets three strikes against Morita,

149
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,780
bringing us to two outs.

150
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,580
Number eight catcher, Watanabe.

151
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,780
The catcher, Watanabe steps into the batter's box.

152
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,880
The pitcher Sakuraba, with the delivery.

153
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,480
He pops it up.

154
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,580
-It's going right... -Foul ball!

155
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,680
Foul.

156
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,880
Strike!

157
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,880
Strike, batter out!

158
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,180
End of the bottom of the 2nd inning,

159
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,880
as Sakuraba from Ohgane High School

160
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,180
prevents Konan High School from breaking the no-run tie.

161
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,380
Bottom of the 2nd. Hitting for Konan High School.

162
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:08,180
Third baseman, Nagashima.

163
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,880
And the batter we've been waiting for takes the box.

164
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,680
Konan High School's Nagashima.

165
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,180
Listen to this.

166
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:24,180
The roar of the cheer of the people loud enough to erase the announcement.

167
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,280
By some strange coincidence, it turns out that the same players

168
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,780
get to compete against each other three times in a row

169
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,180
at the finals of Koshien.

170
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:36,480
Will the victor be the winner of last year, Konan High School?

171
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,780
Or will it be Ohgane High School that is aiming

172
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,480
to win the spring and summer games successively?

173
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,980
The pitcher flings his arms up high

174
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,880
and prepares to throw his first pitch.

175
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,980
There goes the ball!

176
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,580
Strike!

177
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,680
Talk about strike indeed!

178
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,180
Strike. Strike.

179
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,380
Hey, Pops.

180
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,280
What have you been looking at all this time?

181
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,880
Dad. The game's over that side.

182
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,080
I bet he's watching the cheerleaders in those stand.

183
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,880
Pervert.

184
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,080
We came all the way out here.

185
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,580
So watch the game, will you?

186
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,980
But...

187
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,180
Sitting in right stand like this,

188
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,680
it's so far that you can't really watch the game anyway.

189
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,080
I thought we were going to have better seats because you invited us.

190
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,480
I'm so sorry.

191
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,480
I asked an acquaintance of mine who lives here

192
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,980
to line up and get the tickets,

193
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,980
but he seems to have overslept.

194
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,480
Inspector Ohtaki.

195
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,880
Besides, the game between Ohgane and Konan is super popular.

196
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,880
So, unless you come really early in the morning,

197
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,580
it seems to be impossible to get an infield seat.

198
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,180
That's why you should buy advance tickets.

199
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,580
Nagashima faces off against the pitcher, Inao.

200
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:08,280
Here comes the second ball.

201
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,680
He pops it up!

202
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,480
It clears the field and goes just foul.

203
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,080
Here, have some ice candy. Ice candy.

204
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,380
I bought one for each one of you.

205
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,480
Cold!

206
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,880
Thank you.

207
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,780
You're welcome.

208
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,480
But are you sure it's okay, Inspector Ohtaki?

209
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,680
What about you work?

210
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,580
No problem. He took time off anyway.

211
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,680
Right?

212
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,780
Yes.

213
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,880
I've been watching the game for three days since the semi-finals.

214
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,480
You like Koshien, don't you?

215
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,680
Of course he does.

216
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:47,380
Mr. Ohtaki may not look it, but he used to play high school baseball.

217
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,380
Right?

218
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,380
Come on, Kazuha. It's no big deal.

219
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,880
Oh, really?

220
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,180
How embarrassing.

221
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:03,880
Have you played on this Koshien field, too?

222
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,280
No.

223
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,780
Making it to the best eight for the preliminary district match

224
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,780
was as far as I ever went.

225
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,680
But coming here and watching them play brings back memories.

226
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,980
The days when we struggled while covered with sweat and dirt

227
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,280
just to after that one ball.

228
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,580
And just by giving the game everything you have.

229
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,580
Just what do you think you're doing, Ohtaki?

230
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,080
There!

231
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,280
What's the matter? Missing a ball like that, Ohtaki?

232
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,980
I guess I don't have the knack for playing baseball.

233
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,880
That's not true. Don't give up.

234
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,080
All you need to do is practice a little more.

235
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,080
Right. I'll practice even more and get better.

236
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,280
Hey! Freshman Ohtaki.

237
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,380
Yes, sir?

238
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,680
You'll be the number seven catcher for the practice game

239
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,580
against Yakushiji High School that's coming up.

240
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,980
Yes, sir!

241
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,980
Hey, fantastic. Let's give it our best shot.

242
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,080
Yes.

243
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,180
I wonder if I don't have the knack for baseball?

244
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,980
It's not that.

245
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,980
Don't give up and practice more and more.

246
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,280
If you give up before doing anything, that's it.

247
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,680
I was really hopeless when I started off, too.

248
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,580
But I stayed after school everyday and practiced.

249
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,080
Then one day, I realized that I had become captain of my team.

250
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,980
You weren't a good player?

251
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,280
No. I was really bad.

252
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,680
Are you serious?

253
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,180
Yes. So don't give up, okay?

254
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,680
Hey, what's with that look of yours?

255
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,180
All the underclass men don't know what to do since you look so depressed.

256
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,880
Ohtaki, you're the one who lead the weak team to where it is now.

257
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,180
The underclass men are the ones who are going to Koshien.

258
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,880
Encourage them and make them feel that can do it.

259
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,380
I have one last thing I'd like to say to all of you.

260
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,480
No matter what...

261
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,780
No matter what, don't ever give up!

262
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,280
Yes, sir...

263
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,180
So I really think,

264
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,580
that the effort I put in back then was worth it.

265
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,580
I feel that one should never give up.

266
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:16,580
Really? Koshien is really a good place.

267
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,580
What a worthless place this is.

268
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,880
Don't you think so, Hiroshi?

269
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,730
Bottom of the 2nd inning, Konan High School batting,

270
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,130
Nagashima in the batter's box.

271
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:54,430
Pitcher Inao is on the mound.

272
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,530
Here it comes!

273
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,930
He hit towards third base.

274
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,830
It's a long ball.

275
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,130
Fast! The one who hit the ball is fast.

276
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,430
The left fielder sure is taking his time.

277
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,930
I think the runner's going to make it to third base, don't you?

278
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:17,030
Go! Go!

279
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,430
Left! Left! Just what do you think you're doing?

280
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:29,530
Nagashima rounds second and heads for third.

281
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,930
The left fielder throws it to the infiled, a fast one to third base.

282
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,730
It's a good throw.

283
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:40,130
Nagashima is almost to third, he dives.

284
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,030
The third baseman catches...

285
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,930
-Safe! -Safe!

286
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,530
The fleet-footed Nagashima gets a three base hit.

287
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,330
No out third base.

288
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,230
I guess them scoring a point can't be helped.

289
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,630
No, you can't tell yet.

290
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,530
That pitcher sure got guts.

291
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:12,030
It's the first round of the spring preliminaries

292
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,230
We are now in the 18th inning of overtime.

293
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,130
This match between Teitou High School and Ohgane High School

294
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:19,230
has had its share of ups and downs.

295
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,430
At the bottom of the 18th with two outs,

296
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:23,930
Teitou High School is hitting with a runner on first.

297
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:26,930
In the batter's box is number four, Yamamoto.

298
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,430
Inao faces off against Yamamoto.

299
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,030
Here's the pitch.

300
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,030
A cell phone?

301
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,830
Was it there from before?

302
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:03,630
Maybe the man who passed by here a while ago dropped it.

303
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,730
Let me see.

304
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,330
Hello? Are you the one who dropped this cell phone?

305
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,630
Yes.

306
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:15,030
Then come to the right stand.

307
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,630
Having fun?

308
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,730
What?

309
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:28,630
I'm asking you if this place is such an enjoyable place?

310
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,230
Who are you?

311
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:34,930
If it's okay with you, let's play an even more enjoyable game.

312
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:38,030
It's way more fun

313
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,930
-than this baseball game. -Strike!

314
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:43,530
An exchange of lives that will make your blood stir.

315
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:48,330
Well, it is an exchange of lives, but the one who's going to die is me.

316
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,830
You idiot! If you want to die, go and die on your own.

317
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,130
Yes, I'll do that.

318
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:59,630
But I can't die alone.

319
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:03,230
Being alone is much too lonely.

320
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,730
What?

321
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:07,130
The rule is simple.

322
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:11,730
Each time the third, sixth, and ninth innings end,

323
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:15,130
I'll call the cell phone that I've left somewhere on this baseball ground.

324
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,330
Ball!

325
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:29,530
I will ring my cell phone that will be the clue to where I am.

326
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:34,330
I will be near the phone that will ring after the game ends.

327
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,230
Strike!

328
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,530
I will ring only three times.

329
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,330
If you don't answer by then,

330
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:45,330
it's three out and game set.

331
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:49,630
Of course if you gather all the cell phones

332
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:53,230
before they ring and find me before the game ends,

333
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,230
it's your win.

334
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:58,030
Hey, you got to be kidding. Cut out your stupid talk!

335
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,030
I'm hanging up.

336
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,230
You'll find out whether I'm kidding or not

337
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:05,830
after the end of the bottom of the second inning.

338
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,330
Hey, just what do you mean by that?

339
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:14,630
So your first clue is written in the mail of the cell phone.

340
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:17,430
Yes, tell that to the police detective sitting next to you

341
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:21,430
that I'm looking forward to seeing him, too.

342
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:24,130
Okay, then. I'll talk to you later.

343
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,430
Wait up.

344
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,230
At least tell me your name.

345
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,830
Me? I'm...

346
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,830
The Demon of Koshien.

347
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,330
You can call me that.

348
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,730
-The Demon of Koshien? -The Demon of Koshien?

349
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,330
Hey, you!

350
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,530
Strike! Batter out!

351
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:06,830
-Okay! -Okay!

352
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,730
Is the bottom of the second inning finished?

353
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,630
It's still one out.

354
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,730
What's with you, Heiji? Aren't you watching the game?

355
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:20,030
The strike out ball just now was a very fast ball.

356
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,830
I found it!

357
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,030
This is it.

358
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:26,030
96, 7, 13.

359
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,730
What's that?

360
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:33,730
The telephone number of the whereabouts of the owner of this telephone.

361
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:37,730
What's that? Why doesn't he come get it himself?

362
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,630
I wonder what it is though?

363
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,630
96, 7, 13.

364
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,230
It doesn't seem like a seat number.

365
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,730
Could it be some kind of code again?

366
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:49,130
Enough of codes!

367
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,030
Thanks to an odd code,

368
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:55,330
we ended up not being able to go to Takarazuka.

369
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:01,230
If it's 8, 1 and 2, it's the Alps stand.

370
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,230
-Alps stand? -Alps stand?

371
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,730
Why?

372
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:12,430
Because 8 (hachi), 1 (ichi) and 2 (ni) is pronounced as "Heidi".

373
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:17,430
And Heidi is connected with the Alps, right?

374
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,530
So lame.

375
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:26,630
Please, Dad.

376
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,530
Oh, well.

377
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:32,430
Mr. Ohtaki, please help us find him.

378
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:36,430
But this is the best part.

379
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:39,030
Don't worry. We'll be done right away

380
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,730
if you come with us, Mr. Ohtaki.

381
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:44,330
Are you going too, Conan?

382
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,930
Because it sounds like fun.

383
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:52,130
Well, don't worry. We'll give it to the owner

384
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,030
and come right back.

385
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,330
What's with him?

386
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:03,330
He's the one who wanted to come here with us.

387
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,730
Seriously.

388
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,930
What? Suicide?

389
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,030
Really? Heiji?

390
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,030
Yes! He saying that if we don't find it

391
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:37,730
before the end of the game, he's going to die.

392
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,930
He says he'll kill someone along with himself, too.

393
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:43,230
But maybe it's just a prank.

394
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,930
I think it's most likely not a prank.

395
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:49,730
The one who called didn't change his voice,

396
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:54,730
and the manufacture number seal was pasted on the cell phone, too.

397
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,830
It means that he doesn't mind his identity being revealed later, right?

398
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:01,130
Moreover, he's doing something like this

399
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:03,830
knowing that you're an inspector, Mr. Ohtaki,

400
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:06,830
which means that this man must really be desperate.

401
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:12,330
At any rate, please use your police badge, Mr. Ohtaki.

402
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:14,830
And let us in behind the back net.

403
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,530
What? Why behind the back net?

404
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:21,430
On the phone a while ago, I heard the referee call out strike.

405
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:24,130
He could still be there.

406
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,130
Right.

407
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,130
No.

408
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,530
Oh, no. Heiji,

409
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:36,730
he's not going to die until the game ends, right?

410
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:41,030
The man says he'll show proof after the bottom of the second inning.

411
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,630
What?

412
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,830
We're going in, Mr. Ohtaki.

413
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:54,830
If the cheers that we heard just now was for the third out...

414
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,830
Maybe he's already done something.

415
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,530
No good. Just as I thought.

416
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,630
The bottom of the second inning is over.

417
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,130
You go down.

418
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:16,530
I'll go up. Mr. Ohtaki, please search the center.

419
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,330
He's a suspicious looking man wearing a cap.

420
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,630
Okay.

421
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:47,330
Darn it! He's not here after all.

422
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:56,230
But nothing is happening.

423
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,730
Nothing.

424
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:09,810
The third inning, batter for Ohgane High School

425
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:13,510
is number nine. Right fielder, Seki.

426
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:16,410
Sakuraba, with the pitch.

427
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,710
Here it is.

428
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,210
Hit!

429
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,210
Straight down the third baseline, the third baseman picks it up.

430
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:24,410
And a fast one to first!

431
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,510
And he's...

432
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:30,710
Out!

433
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:45,210
A picture-perfect play by Konan High School's third baseman, Nagashima.

434
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:49,010
Seki makes one out here at the top of the third for Ohgane High School.

435
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,710
Hey, Heiji.

436
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,510
What's going on?

437
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,810
There's nothing happened, right?

438
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,510
Strange.

439
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,510
The guy who called said that he'd show evidence

440
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,610
after the bottom of the second inning ends.

441
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:15,910
Maybe it's a prank after all?

442
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,710
Who'd do a thing like that at the finals of Koshien?

443
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,110
Hey.

444
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,310
I wonder what that is?

445
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,610
There. On the other side of the freeway.

446
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,910
What is it?

447
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,510
Smoke is rising.

448
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,610
It looks like fire.

449
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:37,010
It seems to be around Tekiryokumachi.

450
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,410
Mr. Ohtaki, you once told me

451
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,410
that you have a superior working at the Hyogo Prefectural Police, right?

452
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:43,410
Yes.

453
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:45,710
Won't you please call and ask him?

454
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:46,910
Okay.

455
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:09,010
What?

456
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:11,210
A bomb?

457
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:13,210
Is that true, Mr. Kazuhisa?

458
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,810
As for the details, I can't say for sure

459
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:18,810
until I see the report of the fire-fighters after they put out the fire,

460
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,510
but it seems to be so.

461
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:24,510
A company called Takano Transport seems to have caught fire.

462
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:27,810
According to what the neighbours are saying,

463
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:32,010
before that place caught fire, a loud boom seems to have been heard.

464
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,710
I see.

465
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:36,610
Fortunately, that company was off today.

466
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:40,210
So there seems to have been no casualties.

467
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:43,510
They think a bomb went off because the sound

468
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:46,210
came from a building that was supposedly empty.

469
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:49,210
And do you know when the building caught fire?

470
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,810
Well...

471
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:52,410
Hey, Numata.

472
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:53,610
Yes, sir?

473
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:56,610
You know that fire that's being put out now?

474
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:59,810
Do you know what time it started?

475
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:04,210
I think it was about 2:40 in the afternoon?

476
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,310
Just around when...

477
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:09,010
Around when the bottom of the second inning ended.

478
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,710
This looks bad, Hattori.

479
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:15,010
If the evidence that the guy warned us about over the phone

480
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:17,310
was that explosion that caused the fire,

481
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,510
maybe the way he's going to commit suicide is...

482
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,210
Moron.

483
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:23,910
If he commits suicide with a bomb in a place like this with so many people,

484
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,810
it would cause a grave disaster!

485
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,110
Hey, Ohtaki.

486
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:45,810
Come to think of it, aren't you at Koshien today?

487
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,710
How do you know about the fire?

488
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,510
Oh, well...

489
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,410
Heiji, what do you want to do?

490
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,710
Do you want to tell the police about this?

491
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,810
No!

492
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,410
The guy who called is saying

493
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:59,210
that he's going to commit suicide when the ball game ends.

494
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:03,110
We don't want to start a useless commotion here and end the game.

495
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,110
Because the minute it ends, we will all be blown up.

496
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:07,410
I think it would be better to listen to what the man has to say for now

497
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,510
and solve the codes one after the other.

498
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:12,410
Trace the three cell phones

499
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:15,810
and arrest the man.

500
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:18,510
Either way, we'll have to solve the codes

501
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,310
before the bottom of the third inning ends

502
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,510
and find the first cell phone

503
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:26,010
that is hidden somewhere in the stands of Koshien,

504
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,210
or we're finished.

505
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,810
The top of the third inning,

506
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,410
one out and runners on first and second base.

507
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,010
There is a map of the stands

508
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:49,110
right behind the back net of gate number eight here.

509
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,510
I guess I'll go outside,

510
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:53,410
look at the map, and use my head and decipher the code.

511
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:57,910
The meaning of these numbers 96, 7, 13!

512
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:03,910
I'll go borrow the radio from Pops then.

513
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,510
We need to know how the game is progressing, or we'll be in trouble, right?

514
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,410
Do so, will you?

515
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:18,210
Position number three, Pitcher Inao.

516
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,610
All right! Clean up time.

517
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:24,010
I guess this game is going to be a long one.

518
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,310
Let's go, Heiji.

519
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,610
Okay.

520
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:02,030
-Ball! -Ball!

521
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:06,630
It's clean up, but the pitcher is not quite in control of the ball.

522
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,930
If the runner gets to walk, then it'll be one out with the bases loaded.

523
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:18,630
And then comes the fourth batter.

524
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,930
Heiji and the others sure are late.

525
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:26,730
Maybe they can't find the owner of the cell phone yet.

526
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:30,430
If so, why don't give up already and hurry on come back here?

527
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:34,430
The man who dropped it is to blame, and not us.

528
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,730
True.

529
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,830
Don't worry!

530
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:41,830
We'll find that man for sure,

531
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,430
so wait a while longer.

532
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,730
Conan.

533
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:49,730
Pops, will you please lend me your radio?

534
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,130
Huh?

535
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,730
Searching for that man,

536
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:56,230
we won't be able to tell how the game is progressing.

537
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,730
Okay? You'll lend it to me, right?

538
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,330
Gosh.

539
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,430
Don't break it.

540
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,230
Here you go.

541
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,380
Thank you.

542
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:09,680
And if you see a suspicious man wearing a white cap,

543
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,180
call Heiji on the cell phone, okay?

544
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,680
Hey, Conan!

545
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,780
They look so much alike.

546
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,680
Conan's face just now...

547
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:27,180
looked so much like him back then.

548
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,480
He hit the ball! This is a big one!

549
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,180
Right back! Right back!

550
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,980
What? It's coming this way!

551
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,480
I think the ball will make it.

552
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,280
Thrust forward by the beach wind, the ball flies into the right stand...

553
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,880
He caught the ball!

554
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,580
The runner on second base starts!

555
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,380
The ball goes pass second base.

556
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,080
-Safe! -Safe!

557
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,080
From that fly ball to the right field to touch up

558
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,480
makes for two outs with runners on first and third base.

559
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,280
Although the hit looked to be a homerun,

560
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,580
the ball was blocked by the beach wind

561
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,480
and both wings spreading out wide over this vast Koshien of 96 meters!

562
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,980
Both wings are 96 meters?

563
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:15,380
96, 7, 13.

564
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,680
Where is it? Where is it?

565
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,680
I'm sure that it's indicating the seats somewhere here.

566
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,880
Heiji, we'd better hurry or we'll run out of time.

567
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,980
Darn it.

568
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,180
Where is it?

569
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,280
Heiji!

570
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,380
I borrowed the radio!

571
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,880
How's the game going?

572
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,980
The top of the third inning just finished,

573
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,180
and the score's still zero-zero.

574
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,680
Three outs left.

575
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:50,180
Hey. Do you know that is there such a wing in this ball field?

576
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,380
Wing?

577
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,580
Because I heard them say,

578
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:57,280
Koshien have both wings with 96 meters on the radio.

579
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,580
You really don't know a thing about baseball, do you?

580
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,980
Well, they don't say both wings in other games

581
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,480
so I guess it can't be helped, but...

582
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,380
Kid, both wings with 96 meters

583
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:18,380
means that the distance from the home base to the pole is 96 meters.

584
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,880
Don't tell me that the first 96 code

585
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,580
means the seats by the end of the pole?

586
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,580
But which way, Heiji?

587
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:33,680
There are poles on both sides, the right and left.

588
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,980
Then maybe the next number seven in parenthesis means something?

589
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:42,380
-Seven... -Seven...

590
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,380
Hey, this looks bad!

591
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,980
It's three balls three strikes and one out!

592
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,280
Kid, turn your back on me!

593
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,380
Huh?

594
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,080
Like this?

595
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,380
I see!

596
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,580
You see what, Heiji?

597
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:02,380
The number of the outfit the boy's wearing is 55, not 7.

598
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,380
Right the number on the back of the outfit!

599
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,580
In high school baseball, where is the player wearing number seven?

600
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,180
Number seven is left field.

601
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,080
Which means, Heiji...

602
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,080
In other words, it's the seat at the end of the left pole!

603
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,380
Then, what about the last 13?

604
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:22,280
Probably the seat on the 13th aisle!

605
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,480
The first cell phone is there!

606
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,580
It's the bottom of the third inning. The two batters of Konan High School

607
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,880
struck out three times in a row and now with two outs.

608
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,380
The next batter is number one left, Iwata.

609
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:41,980
The pitcher flings his arms high in order to throw his first ball.

610
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,780
Strike!

611
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,080
Straight in high.

612
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,380
The pitcher throws his second ball in good rhythm.

613
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,680
Strike two.

614
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,580
Outlaw, another straight!

615
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:01,380
27, 26, 25.

616
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,480
The pitcher flings up his arms.

617
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,380
21, 20, 19.

618
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,880
The third pitch...

619
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,680
15, 14.

620
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,680
He has thrown the ball!

621
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,880
13!

622
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,880
Over here!

623
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,480
Strike three!

624
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,580
Don't answer it! Give it to me!

625
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,080
Hello? Hello?

626
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:33,380
Hey, you! What's so funny?

627
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,780
It's really interesting.

628
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,880
You kids sure are interesting.

629
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,680
Hang in there a while longer and entertain me, will you?

630
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:47,480
I love to see people making futile effort.

631
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,080
Hold it, you!

632
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,980
Hey! Hello? Hello?

633
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,880
Darn it! He hung up.

634
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,380
Hey, look!

635
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,380
The next code is on the display.

636
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:06,480
47, 3 and 4.

637
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:15,180
Yes, futile effort.

638
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:20,180
There is no such thing as a victory

639
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,580
that can be won through effort.

640
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,580
It doesn't exist.

641
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:37,890
It is the top of the fourth inning,

642
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:39,990
the batter for Ohgane High School

643
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:43,190
is number five, left fielder, Shigeta.

644
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:47,490
Shigeta versus Sakuraba.

645
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:49,290
The first pitch.

646
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:50,990
He hit the ball!

647
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:52,990
It's up! The left line.

648
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:56,790
He caught it! He caught the ball!

649
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:58,290
Great play!

650
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:09,290
That third is really fantastic!

651
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:12,090
Yes. He sure is.

652
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:22,290
At any rate, let's get with this code.

653
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:24,590
Before the end of the bottom of the sixth inning,

654
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:28,590
we've got to locate where this number 47,3, 4 indicates

655
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:31,590
and find the second cell phone!

656
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:33,990
Before that man wearing the white cap

657
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:36,890
uses the bomb to commit suicide.

658
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:41,790
But these numbers are hard to figure out again.

659
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:44,390
Not really. I've figured out half of it.

660
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:45,590
What?

661
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:51,190
Because we figured out that the first code 96, 7, 13,

662
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:54,490
indicated that the first cell phone was on the 13th aisle

663
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:57,890
at the edge of the left pole.

664
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:02,190
96 is the distance from the home base to the pole.

665
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,690
The seven in parenthesis is the number on the back of the uniform

666
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:07,190
and left of high school baseball.

667
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:10,290
The final 13 means the seat on the 13th aisle!

668
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:13,390
Which means that the number 3 in the parenthesis of the numbers 47, 3, 4

669
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:15,690
is the number on back of the uniform

670
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:19,690
and the last number four means the fourth aisle of a seat somewhere, right?

671
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:23,990
But we've got to find out where that somewhere is.

672
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:27,990
Number four is probably the one that indicates that.

673
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:31,390
There's no doubt that it's a seat by the first base.

674
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:35,290
In high school baseball, the player with number three is at first base.

675
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:39,290
But Heiji, the one wearing number three at Konan High School

676
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:41,390
is the third base.

677
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:45,890
Out!

678
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:49,990
He's special so you shouldn't be concerned about him.

679
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:52,290
But if the guy made the code in accordance

680
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:56,890
to this final game between Konan and Ohgane,

681
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:59,890
maybe it would be of some concern.

682
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:01,690
Okay, tell you what?

683
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:06,390
I'll go check the fourth aisle of the infield stand by first base,

684
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,190
so you go check the third base side.

685
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:09,190
Okay.

686
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:10,490
What about me?

687
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:14,290
After you get us into the infield stand,

688
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:18,290
wait for us at the map of the Koshien outside that we saw a while ago.

689
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:22,190
That place is right in the centre of the infield stand

690
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:23,690
of the first and third base,

691
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:26,090
so whether I find the cell phone or the kid does,

692
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:28,490
it'll be easy for us to join up.

693
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:30,190
Okay. While I'm waiting,

694
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:33,390
I'll call and ask my superior at Hyogo Prefectural Station

695
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:39,090
if the Takano Transport company that was bombed and set on fire

696
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:42,290
by the guy wearing the white cap had been hated by someone recently.

697
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:45,090
Do that will you, Mr. Ohtaki?

698
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:48,990
Strike!

699
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:51,190
Three strikes.

700
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:54,590
Eight strike outs in a row!

701
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:59,790
The droning ball shows no signs of weakening at all even at the finals.

702
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:04,990
Hey, what's with you, kid?

703
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:08,890
I'm just looking for something.

704
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:10,990
Okay, they're really going for it!

705
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:13,890
Will the ninth player strike out in a row?

706
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:19,290
Idiot! Use more balls and slow down the progress of the game.

707
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:24,790
What? Is that true?

708
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:27,890
Last month the truck of Takano Transport...

709
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:31,590
Huh?

710
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:46,290
It's a homerun!

711
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,290
In the bottom of the fourth inning,

712
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:49,390
thanks to the hit of the big slugger of Konan High School,

713
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:50,690
they've taken a one point lead.

714
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:55,890
No, no. I can't be watching the game.

715
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:58,390
-I got to find it quick. -Super batting just as expected.

716
00:48:58,390 --> 00:48:59,590
Moreover,

717
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:02,990
-he's using a wooden bat and not a metal one. -47, 3 and 4.

718
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:05,790
-Incredible. -47, 3 and 4. What is it?

719
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:09,390
Metal?

720
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:15,590
Metal...

721
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:16,690
Metal.

722
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:33,890
Strike! Batter out!

723
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:36,890
Kubota gets three strikes and is out!

724
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:37,890
But in this inning,

725
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:42,090
Konan High School scored a run from Nagashima's home run.

726
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:44,990
Ohgane High School are trying to make up for it now.

727
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:46,890
In the batter box is number eight, Watanabe.

728
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:57,790
Sakuraba throws against Watanabe.

729
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:59,090
A hit.

730
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:00,490
Right down to the middle.

731
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:24,890
Out!

732
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:29,990
Konan High School third baseman,

733
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:32,590
Nagashima is really showing his skills in this game.

734
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:44,890
Strike!

735
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,690
Inao's third pitch against Sakuraba.

736
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,490
Here it comes!

737
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:06,290
Strike! Batter out!

738
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:07,990
A swing and a strike out.

739
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:10,390
Konan High School with no runs in this inning.

740
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:14,990
As the fifth inning comes to a close, the score is 0-1.

741
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:16,590
Konan High School is still with a one run lead

742
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:19,690
from Nagashima's home run in the fourth.

743
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:10,390
Out!

744
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:24,190
Top of the sixth inning, hitting for Konan High School

745
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:28,190
is number nine, second baseman, Michishita.

746
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:30,090
Kudo?

747
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:31,790
How about it? Did you find it?

748
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:35,690
No. I searched all through the fourth aisle,

749
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:36,890
but it's nowhere.

750
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:38,690
And how about you?

751
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:40,290
Same here.

752
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:43,390
I guess we'll just have to decipher

753
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:45,390
the meaning of the figure 47.

754
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:48,790
Hey, Hattori.

755
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:51,590
What is it, Kudo?

756
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:53,090
At Koshien,

757
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:55,290
there's nothing that is gold, is there?

758
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:59,590
Well, at Koshien the gold would be...

759
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:00,990
"Ginsan".

760
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:03,490
Huh? You mean there is something called that?

761
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:05,490
You can see it, can't you?

762
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:08,590
The big roof hooked onto the ceiling behind the back net,

763
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:10,490
that's it.

764
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:12,390
Then, there's no doubt about it.

765
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:14,490
The second cell phone is there!

766
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:16,390
Huh? Why?

767
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:17,590
You know, don't you?

768
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:20,190
47 is gold.

769
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:21,490
That's right!

770
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:25,190
47 is the atomic number for gold!

771
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:28,190
Let's go outside and go in behind the back net

772
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:29,490
and check the seats in the fourth aisle.

773
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:31,190
But I wonder if we'll make it in time?

774
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:33,690
The seats under the "ginsan" behind the back net

775
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:35,390
has 100 seats an aisle.

776
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:37,290
If we try checking every seat from now,

777
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:39,490
three outs and that's it!

778
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:41,890
Then maybe it's first base or third base?

779
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:44,690
Because there's a 3 under 47.

780
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:45,990
Idiot!

781
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:48,190
You just checked there.

782
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:49,990
There's got to be something else.

783
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:51,290
Number three on the back of the uniform

784
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:53,390
that would indicate a seat under "ginsan".

785
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:58,190
I got it.

786
00:53:58,190 --> 00:53:59,890
There is one, Kudo!

787
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:02,790
Another number three, on the back of the uniform!

788
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:07,190
Mr. Ohtaki!

789
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:08,990
Heiji.

790
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:11,090
Did you figure out the code?

791
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:12,590
Yes.

792
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:15,190
The first 47 stands for "ginsan",

793
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:18,690
and the next three in the parenthesis is...

794
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,690
the one wearing the number three on the back of his uniform,

795
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:24,590
the Bay Bruce monument!

796
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:29,690
Which means that the location of the 2nd cell phone is...

797
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:31,690
The location of this monument

798
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:34,490
is slightly left from the centre.

799
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:35,890
In other words,

800
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:40,590
under "ginsan", slightly left from the center behind the back net

801
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:43,590
and a seat in the fourth aisle!

802
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:55,290
What is it?

803
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:57,090
What's up?

804
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:59,490
The player made first base because the catcher fumbled.

805
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:01,290
But we've got to hurry.

806
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:02,790
It's two outs already.

807
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:03,890
There's only one more out to go!

808
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:07,790
-Ball! -Ball!

809
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:09,590
Two three!

810
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:10,590
It's the bottom of the sixth inning.

811
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:13,690
It's two out with a runner on first base because of a fumble.

812
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:15,090
Count two three.

813
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:16,990
If this batter walks,

814
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:21,790
next in line is Konan's big slugger, who scored a homerun.

815
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:26,990
Okay, the pitcher gets a hold of himself

816
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,990
and from set position, throws his sixth ball.

817
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:30,990
The ball's been hit.

818
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:34,990
It's a foul fly.

819
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:38,390
But the ball flies in front of the Konan bench by first base.

820
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:39,690
The catcher stops going after the ball.

821
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:41,990
The pitcher.

822
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:45,190
The pitcher goes after the ball and dashes into the Konan bench!

823
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:51,190
Is the pitcher all right?

824
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:58,190
He caught the ball! He caught it!

825
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:02,390
The fantastic play of the pitcher and it's three out change!

826
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:04,390
Amazing!

827
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:06,290
Talk about being reckless.

828
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:12,990
I wonder if all boys are that way.

829
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:13,990
Huh?

830
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:17,490
This is indeed the finals of the Koshien.

831
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:19,790
The passion that the players display towards the ball can't help

832
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:21,890
but has touched the hearts of all who are watching!

833
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:41,590
Hey, you stupid idiot!

834
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:44,190
Listen, I'm going to find the third cell phone right away

835
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:45,990
and get a hold of where you are

836
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:48,590
so you can look forward to me getting to you real soon, you fool!

837
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:54,990
Darn it! He hung up without saying anything.

838
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:56,690
Come to think of it, Heiji.

839
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:58,590
You know the Takano Transport case?

840
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:02,290
According to what my superior told me,

841
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:06,690
the truck of that company ran over a person a month ago in Tokyo,

842
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:09,590
and it seemed one person died.

843
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:12,990
Maybe that accident has something to do with this?

844
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:16,890
But what does that have to do with Koshien?

845
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:19,590
I still don't know but...

846
00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:20,990
Well, never mind.

847
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:23,790
Let's just nab the guy and ask him directly.

848
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:28,190
We already know how to decipher the code, so...

849
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:32,590
What's this?

850
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:35,990
Only the number of aisle is written here.

851
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:39,590
No hint.

852
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:57,890
Hiroshi.

853
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,350
Why?

854
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:35,950
Why is only the aisle number of the seats written?

855
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:42,850
Maybe it's because you shouted at him furiously on the phone a while ago?

856
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:47,350
I'm going to find the 3rd cell phone right away

857
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:49,350
and get a hold of where you are,

858
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:51,850
so you can look forward to me getting to you real soon, you fool!

859
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:58,050
Darn it! He hung up without saying anything.

860
00:58:58,050 --> 00:59:00,750
If the guy's saying that he's going to commit suicide using a bomb,

861
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:02,850
it's not surprising that he'd get pissed at what you said

862
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:06,150
and decided not to give you any clue!

863
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:07,150
Idiot!

864
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:08,650
If he was one to get pissed over something like that,

865
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:10,750
he would've pushed the switch for the bomb long ago

866
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:14,350
and the stand somewhere here would be in bad trouble!

867
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:16,150
There's some kind of meaning to it.

868
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:18,650
The blank in this code.

869
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:21,650
It's indicating some stand of Koshien here.

870
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:34,250
But what an odd guy.

871
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:35,950
If he really wants to commit suicide,

872
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:38,650
why would he give out complicated clues

873
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:41,850
and make people look for where he is?

874
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:45,550
Maybe he wants somebody to stop him?

875
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:46,650
-Huh? -Huh?

876
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:49,450
I'm sure that person

877
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:52,750
is hoping deep down in his heart that somebody will stop him.

878
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:55,050
And maybe he doesn't even realize it himself.

879
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:57,650
He wants somebody to stop him?

880
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:00,450
Because the code that he thought up

881
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:05,450
cannot be made unless he is interested in Koshien or baseball.

882
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:09,850
It's hard to believe that such a person

883
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:12,850
would want to do something like that at Koshien,

884
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:15,750
much less use a bomb to commit suicide, right?

885
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:18,250
I guess so.

886
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:19,950
Mr. Ohtaki.

887
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:20,950
Huh?

888
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:23,350
Please call the Hyogo Prefectural police once more

889
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:26,150
and ask them for more detailed information

890
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:28,750
about the traffic accident a month ago,

891
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:32,150
that Takano Transport the man set fire with a bomb that was involved in.

892
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:33,650
I also want to know what the motive of a baseball fan

893
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:37,650
who would do something like this at Koshien is, too.

894
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:39,350
Okay.

895
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:42,850
Then, shall we think about this code

896
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:45,450
and look through the seats in the 13th row?

897
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:48,050
Just look at each and every seat

898
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:49,950
until the time limit when the bottom of the ninth inning ends.

899
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:52,650
Let's do so.

900
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:56,450
Who know whether there'll be a bottom of the ninth inning or not though.

901
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:57,750
I see!

902
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:01,750
Unless Ohgane who is batting first, catches up or wins the score,

903
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:04,350
the top of the ninth inning will be the end of the game.

904
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:06,750
The game is at the top of eight,

905
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:08,050
one out, runner on third.

906
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:10,550
Ohgane High School has a chance to even the score.

907
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:20,450
The pitcher gets into set position.

908
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:23,050
The third runner has dashed off!

909
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:24,050
It's a squeeze!

910
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:29,950
It's a short fly in front of the pitcher!

911
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:38,550
He caught the ball! He caught it!

912
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:40,150
It's a direct catch by the third!

913
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:45,250
The ball goes to third base and it's a double play!

914
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:47,950
Home base is far for Ohgane High School!

915
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:48,950
It's the top of the eighth inning

916
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:49,950
and though they've establish opportunities,

917
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:50,950
they haven't scored a point yet!

918
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:56,550
The score is still 0-1. It is the bottom of the eighth inning

919
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:59,350
and Konan High School will be batting.

920
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:02,750
Yes.

921
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:04,450
Huh?

922
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:07,150
Huh? A high school student?

923
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:10,450
Are you sure that the one who was run over by the truck

924
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:12,650
was a high school student?

925
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:14,050
Yes.

926
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:18,450
I was in charge of that accident together with a colleague

927
01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:21,150
who was appointed to the Metropolitan police in Tokyo.

928
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:24,750
I asked for all kinds of details.

929
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:26,350
Here it is.

930
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:29,050
I'm sure that you would know since you like high school baseball, right?

931
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:35,150
The name Hiroshi Torimitsu.

932
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:37,250
Yes.

933
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,950
In the first game during the spring selection,

934
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:41,250
the left hander of Teito Jitsugyo High school,

935
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:44,650
who threw 18 extended games along with Ohgane's ace,

936
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:46,850
but lost by a close game.

937
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:48,950
Don't tell me it was that boy?

938
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:50,150
Right.

939
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:53,050
He seems to have dashed out into the road after baseball club practice

940
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:54,550
and was run over.

941
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:10,650
Well, it seems that the boy's bicycle was moving unsteadily to begin with.

942
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:13,750
Something about he had been over practicing baseball.

943
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:19,050
Come to think of it, since the accident,

944
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:20,850
the whereabouts of the boy's father have been unknown,

945
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:23,550
so they were having problems not being able to ask questions.

946
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:26,350
Don't tell me that...

947
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:31,250
Father.

948
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:34,350
Strike!

949
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,750
I'm going to give it my best shot.

950
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:47,450
I'm going to do even better

951
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:50,550
during the summer Koshien,

952
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:52,150
become a professional,

953
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:54,050
and make money

954
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:55,650
so that you won't have to work that hard.

955
01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:00,050
You can count on me.

956
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:09,450
Father.

957
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:14,650
Hiroshi.

958
01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:25,650
Hey, Kudo. Did you find it?

959
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:28,050
No, it's nowhere.

960
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:32,650
It seems that it's nowhere in the seats of this back net.

961
01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:33,750
Darn it!

962
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:36,950
Why is everything else besides 13 blank?

963
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:37,950
The least he could do

964
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:40,550
is write the number on back of the uniform in parenthesis!

965
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:41,850
Hey, Hattori.

966
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:44,650
Maybe it's that...

967
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:47,450
There's a player with no number on the back of his uniform near the bench.

968
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:50,850
Right.

969
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:52,350
The ball boy, right?

970
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:53,850
I thought so, too.

971
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:57,250
I've checked the seats on the 13th aisle behind both benches,

972
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:58,850
but found nothing.

973
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:04,050
Then all that's left are the Alps stand or outfield seats.

974
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:16,550
Strike! Batter out!

975
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:22,450
Called out on strike, two out!

976
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:24,750
Ohgane High School's tie runner

977
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:27,350
cannot budge an inch from second base.

978
01:05:27,350 --> 01:05:31,950
Konan High School is only one player away from winning the championship.

979
01:05:31,950 --> 01:05:35,850
No good! If the game ends the man's going to blow himself up!

980
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:36,850
Darn it!

981
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:39,550
We don't have time to go around the Alps stands nor the outfield seats!

982
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:41,050
What is this?

983
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:43,350
Why is there nothing written?

984
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:45,450
That fact that nothing is written...

985
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:48,450
A zero? Nothing? White?

986
01:06:06,050 --> 01:06:08,050
He hit the ball!

987
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:10,650
An interesting ball that goes up left!

988
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:12,250
Can he catch it?

989
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:13,950
Can he pull through?

990
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:15,650
Will the scores be reversed?

991
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:17,250
Will the game end?

992
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:22,350
Don't catch the ball, you idiot!

993
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:45,130
Konan High School is only one player away from winning the championship.

994
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:49,330
No good! If the game ends the man's going to blow himself up!

995
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:50,430
Darn it!

996
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:53,230
We don't have time to go around the Alps stands nor the outfield seats!

997
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:54,630
What is this?

998
01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:57,030
Why is there nothing written?

999
01:06:57,030 --> 01:06:59,030
That fact that nothing is written...

1000
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:02,230
A zero? Nothing? White?

1001
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:21,530
He hit the ball!

1002
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:24,030
An interesting ball that goes up left!

1003
01:07:24,030 --> 01:07:25,730
Can he catch it?

1004
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:27,430
Can he pull through?

1005
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:29,230
Will the scores be reversed?

1006
01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:30,730
Will the game end?

1007
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:36,130
Don't catch the ball, you idiot!

1008
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:39,830
He missed the ball, he missed!

1009
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:41,530
Okay! It's a tie!

1010
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:44,730
Missed?

1011
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:47,030
Wait a second. If I'm not mistaken...

1012
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:49,130
While the ball goes travelling outfield,

1013
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:51,630
the batter runners go from second to third base.

1014
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:53,930
Hey, Kudo? What's up?

1015
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:58,430
The runner dashes out from third base!

1016
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:02,630
The ball goes from hook-up to back home!

1017
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:16,830
Safe!

1018
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:22,030
A running homerun.

1019
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:23,330
Fantastic!

1020
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:24,830
They reversed the score!

1021
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:36,630
Heiji, what's up?

1022
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:39,830
Did you find out about something?

1023
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:42,030
Ask this kid here.

1024
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:43,130
Huh?

1025
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:45,530
See, look at this map.

1026
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:50,130
As to the entrance of the stadium, there are entrance from number 1 to 24,

1027
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:54,430
but the numbers 17 and 22 are missing.

1028
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:58,330
Missing? Number of the entrance.

1029
01:08:58,330 --> 01:09:00,430
Number 17 and...

1030
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:02,330
number 22.

1031
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:04,830
That's true.

1032
01:09:04,830 --> 01:09:09,530
The reason there's no code number is probably because of this.

1033
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:15,030
Now that you mentioned it,

1034
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:17,330
I heard that they blocked off gate number 12 and 22

1035
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:20,730
to make some kind of facility.

1036
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:24,630
But which one is it? 17 or 22?

1037
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:26,930
Where do we look?

1038
01:09:35,830 --> 01:09:40,530
We've no choice. Let's start from number 17.

1039
01:09:40,530 --> 01:09:42,130
Wait!

1040
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:44,230
We don't seem to have that much time.

1041
01:09:46,130 --> 01:09:47,930
Now for the grand finale.

1042
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:50,330
This is the bottom of the ninth inning with two out no runner!

1043
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:52,730
Ohgane High School leads by one point.

1044
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:55,630
The next batter is the one known for his three hits,

1045
01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:57,630
three base hits and one homer.

1046
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:07,730
Number four, third, Nagashima.

1047
01:10:11,730 --> 01:10:15,330
They're going to pick on the weak point and make him walk.

1048
01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:18,030
He's the only one who's had hits, too.

1049
01:10:18,030 --> 01:10:20,630
They don't want to risk him striking a hit

1050
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:22,830
and lose the game after all this.

1051
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:27,730
Strike!

1052
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:36,930
Right in the centre? Straight!

1053
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:39,830
Hey, hey. Is this the end of the game?

1054
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:43,630
Those two are just like Shinichi after all.

1055
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:45,730
Just like?

1056
01:10:45,730 --> 01:10:47,930
Just like Shinichi back in junior high school

1057
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:50,430
during the soccer championship game.

1058
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:53,330
It was lost time with the other team leading by 1 point.

1059
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:56,230
With less than a minute to go, the other team scored another point,

1060
01:10:56,230 --> 01:10:58,530
so it seemed to be over.

1061
01:10:58,530 --> 01:11:01,330
Wanting to see what kind of look Shinichi was wearing

1062
01:11:01,330 --> 01:11:03,230
when returning the ball to the centre.

1063
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:05,230
I looked through the opera glass.

1064
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:09,030
Then I saw him laughing.

1065
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:12,130
Laughing?

1066
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:16,130
Yes. I asked the other boys of the soccer club later

1067
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:19,430
and you know what he was saying while laughing?

1068
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:21,030
What? What?

1069
01:11:22,430 --> 01:11:23,930
I tell you, that guy...

1070
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:34,530
Cool. If we win, we'll be legend.

1071
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:36,930
Awesome.

1072
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:41,530
And? How'd the game turn out?

1073
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:42,930
Right, right!

1074
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:45,330
They lost after all.

1075
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:50,330
Life's not that easy, you see!

1076
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:52,930
During the Penalty Kick.

1077
01:11:52,930 --> 01:11:55,830
Which means...

1078
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:57,730
Right. With a minute left,

1079
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,230
and Shinichi's goal and assistance,

1080
01:11:59,230 --> 01:12:03,430
they somehow made it to penalty kick.

1081
01:12:03,430 --> 01:12:06,930
But in the end it was Shinichi who didn't make the penalty kick, too.

1082
01:12:06,930 --> 01:12:12,930
But his rear view after that looked a bit cool.

1083
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:25,730
Just a bit now, just a bit.

1084
01:12:25,730 --> 01:12:28,330
And Shinichi back then...

1085
01:12:28,330 --> 01:12:32,130
Those two kind of resembled him.

1086
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:34,530
I mean, they refuse to give up.

1087
01:12:34,530 --> 01:12:38,230
The childish character of not wanting to lose.

1088
01:12:38,230 --> 01:12:40,030
I wonder if Heiji is that way, too.

1089
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:42,230
Yes. I'm sure he is.

1090
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:48,530
Strike two!

1091
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:51,430
He swung at air! Two nothing!

1092
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:54,330
Oh, no! They've been cornered!

1093
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:56,630
It's no good, we won't make it.

1094
01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:58,130
Mr. Ohtaki,

1095
01:12:58,130 --> 01:13:01,030
in baseball, you never can tell until the very last minute!

1096
01:13:01,030 --> 01:13:03,330
If you have time thinking of something useless like that,

1097
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:05,630
hurry and think of the meaning of the code, will you?

1098
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:08,330
Right, but I mean really...

1099
01:13:08,330 --> 01:13:12,330
Big slugger of Konan is cornered!

1100
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:15,030
Will he be able to pull the game out of the fire?

1101
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:16,530
Nagashima?

1102
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:21,230
Right! The missing number!

1103
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:22,230
What?

1104
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:24,230
There was no number in the parenthesis

1105
01:13:24,230 --> 01:13:27,130
because it's a retired number!

1106
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:29,330
Retired number?

1107
01:13:29,330 --> 01:13:32,130
Between gates 21 and 23,

1108
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:36,430
there is a booth for a professional team whose home ground is Koshien!

1109
01:13:36,430 --> 01:13:40,330
And there's a reference library where that retired number is displayed!

1110
01:13:40,330 --> 01:13:41,630
But Heiji,

1111
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:44,230
isn't the area between 21 and 23 the place

1112
01:13:44,230 --> 01:13:48,130
where we were to begin with, the right stand?

1113
01:13:48,130 --> 01:13:50,130
Ran.

1114
01:14:04,330 --> 01:14:05,430
Darn it!

1115
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:08,530
You mean she can't hear the phone because of the applause?

1116
01:14:08,530 --> 01:14:10,430
Pitcher Inao!

1117
01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:13,730
This is his 100th ball. There it goes!

1118
01:14:16,730 --> 01:14:18,330
He hit the ball!

1119
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:21,430
Did it go up too high?

1120
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:23,130
You idiot!

1121
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:25,330
The centre spreads his arms out wide

1122
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:27,630
and is waiting for the ball to come his way.

1123
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:29,830
Konan High School, is it over for them?

1124
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:32,330
Don't catch, don't catch.

1125
01:14:32,330 --> 01:14:34,130
Here goes, Hiroshi.

1126
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:36,130
Don't catch it! Don't catch it!

1127
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:38,130
I'm going over to where you are.

1128
01:14:43,530 --> 01:14:46,530
Don't catch the ball! Don't catch it!

1129
01:14:53,870 --> 01:14:55,870
Pitcher Inao!

1130
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:58,570
This is his 100th ball. There it goes!

1131
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:03,970
He hit the ball!

1132
01:15:04,970 --> 01:15:06,770
Did it go up too high?

1133
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:08,370
You idiot!

1134
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:10,670
The centre spreads his hands out wide

1135
01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:12,770
and is waiting for the ball to come his way.

1136
01:15:12,770 --> 01:15:15,070
Konan High School, is it over for them?

1137
01:15:15,070 --> 01:15:17,270
Don't catch it! Don't catch it!

1138
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:19,470
Here goes, Hiroshi.

1139
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:21,370
Don't catch it! Don't catch it!

1140
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:23,570
I'm going over to where you are.

1141
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:31,270
The Ohgane nine are overjoyed because victory seems near!

1142
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:36,570
The centre is still in position to catch the ball

1143
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:38,670
and backs off slowly.

1144
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:43,970
He still backs off.

1145
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:53,270
He made it! He did it! It's a homerun!

1146
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:57,070
It's a tie! A tie!

1147
01:15:59,370 --> 01:16:01,970
Konan High School, the bottom of the ninth inning at the very last minute

1148
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:04,570
with two outs, thanks to their big slugger Nagashima

1149
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:08,270
ties their opponent with a score of 2-2!

1150
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:10,570
That high fly...

1151
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:12,370
Made it.

1152
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:14,870
Amazing.

1153
01:16:19,770 --> 01:16:21,770
What's this?

1154
01:16:23,770 --> 01:16:26,070
What is going on?

1155
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:34,170
Dead ball!

1156
01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:35,670
Dead ball.

1157
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:37,470
Two players in a row!

1158
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:40,670
Ohgane's ace Inao suddenly pitches out of control!

1159
01:16:41,670 --> 01:16:44,470
Is the homerun a while ago affecting him after all?

1160
01:16:46,470 --> 01:16:50,870
That's why they should've let number four walk.

1161
01:16:52,970 --> 01:16:54,770
He puts on airs,

1162
01:16:54,770 --> 01:16:57,670
gets hit and goes out of control, talk about getting worked up.

1163
01:16:57,670 --> 01:17:00,570
This is going to be a walk-off homer.

1164
01:17:17,470 --> 01:17:19,770
Struck out swinging!

1165
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:21,570
All right!

1166
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:24,370
What's with that pitcher?

1167
01:17:24,370 --> 01:17:27,970
The game is 2-2 and will be extended!

1168
01:17:30,370 --> 01:17:32,170
What's this sound?

1169
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:35,370
Behind your feet, Kazuha.

1170
01:17:35,370 --> 01:17:36,570
Huh?

1171
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:42,470
The cell phone again.

1172
01:17:42,470 --> 01:17:44,470
Gosh.

1173
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:46,470
Shall we answer it?

1174
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:53,870
Hey! I found the last cell phone!

1175
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:55,870
Come on and show yourself!

1176
01:17:55,870 --> 01:17:57,370
Heiji?

1177
01:17:57,370 --> 01:17:59,970
The game's not over yet.

1178
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:03,970
It's an extended game.

1179
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:05,570
An extended game?

1180
01:18:05,570 --> 01:18:06,670
Yes.

1181
01:18:06,670 --> 01:18:11,770
The Demon of Koshien favours showing itself just before game sets.

1182
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:13,770
Hey?

1183
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:15,870
He says it's an extended game

1184
01:18:15,870 --> 01:18:18,570
but the next code is nowhere!

1185
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:21,070
Darn it!

1186
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:23,270
Mr. Ohtaki, please look for him!

1187
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:24,770
I'm sure he's still somewhere around here!

1188
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:26,270
Okay!

1189
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:30,770
Mail?

1190
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:33,870
I'll look to the right. So please take care of the left, Mr. Ohtaki!

1191
01:18:33,870 --> 01:18:34,970
Okay!

1192
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:36,070
Wait!

1193
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:40,470
It seems we don't need to look for him anymore.

1194
01:19:09,770 --> 01:19:12,870
Just as expected of the finals of Koshien!

1195
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:15,470
It's a great game!

1196
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:17,370
Nonsense.

1197
01:19:17,370 --> 01:19:20,270
This isn't such a great place.

1198
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:25,070
Right.

1199
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:29,570
If you guys didn't root, encourage and cheer him on like that...

1200
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:36,670
If this place didn't exist...

1201
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:41,470
my son wouldn't have...

1202
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:11,470
He dropped the ball, he dropped it!

1203
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:15,070
He dropped an ordinary catcher's fly!

1204
01:20:15,070 --> 01:20:17,670
Ohgane High School is playing the bottom of the 10th inning

1205
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:20,770
as if possessed by the Demon of Koshien!

1206
01:20:20,770 --> 01:20:22,070
Faced up against an irregular hit,

1207
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:24,570
fielder's choice and error along with two outs and bases loaded,

1208
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:26,470
they are in a pinch!

1209
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:29,870
Moreover, the next batter

1210
01:20:29,870 --> 01:20:32,770
is number four,

1211
01:20:32,770 --> 01:20:34,270
Nagashima!

1212
01:20:38,770 --> 01:20:42,470
They're really up against the wall.

1213
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:44,970
The Ohgane nine gather on the mound!

1214
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:48,970
The disappointed catcher who had dropped the ball cannot lift his head.

1215
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:53,570
Of course he can't.

1216
01:20:53,570 --> 01:20:58,770
He made a blooper in front of a large crowd like this.

1217
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:01,470
The other nine members of the team will hold a grudge against him,

1218
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:05,770
and the player as well as his parents, siblings and even his relatives

1219
01:21:05,770 --> 01:21:09,670
will face embarrassment.

1220
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:14,370
Just for something like this.

1221
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:26,870
They're laughing.

1222
01:21:26,870 --> 01:21:28,970
That pitcher's laughing.

1223
01:21:28,970 --> 01:21:30,670
Really?

1224
01:21:30,670 --> 01:21:32,770
They split running to their positions with smiles on their faces,

1225
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:34,070
the nine members of Ohgane!

1226
01:21:35,870 --> 01:21:36,970
It can't be.

1227
01:21:36,970 --> 01:21:39,770
How can they keep laughing?

1228
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:42,970
Why at this stage?

1229
01:21:42,970 --> 01:21:44,470
Because this is baseball.

1230
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:50,870
You can't play baseball unless all nine members are there.

1231
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:56,470
I'm sure that the pitcher of Ohgane

1232
01:21:56,470 --> 01:22:00,470
is thinking for himself as well as for the team

1233
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:03,670
and for the catcher who made an error,

1234
01:22:03,670 --> 01:22:07,370
that he's going to slug this ball even if his arms break!

1235
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:12,570
He hit the ball!

1236
01:22:12,570 --> 01:22:15,770
But the ball veered slightly to the left and is a foul!

1237
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:18,870
Well, the number number that follows

1238
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:21,870
probably wants to send the runner to home, so he's stepping out

1239
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:23,570
and pitching the ball the way he is, even if the ball may hit him.

1240
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:26,170
Although no one knows which team will win yet!

1241
01:22:26,170 --> 01:22:27,870
Absurd.

1242
01:22:27,870 --> 01:22:30,770
If they go out of their way and get hurt, they can't become professionals.

1243
01:22:30,770 --> 01:22:33,970
They could be throwing their whole life away, you know?

1244
01:22:33,970 --> 01:22:35,570
What is it anyway?

1245
01:22:35,570 --> 01:22:38,670
What is there to this Koshien?

1246
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:42,570
Devastating! It's a right this time!

1247
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:45,070
The ball has enough distance! Will it make it?

1248
01:22:45,070 --> 01:22:47,870
It's a foul! Another big foul!

1249
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:52,070
There's nothing.

1250
01:22:52,070 --> 01:22:55,870
Of course, I think there are many kids here who want to stand out

1251
01:22:55,870 --> 01:22:58,170
and become professionals.

1252
01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:01,570
But that's all before the game.

1253
01:23:01,570 --> 01:23:04,170
Once you set foot on the field

1254
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:06,870
and hear the voice play ball,

1255
01:23:06,870 --> 01:23:08,770
for those kids out there,

1256
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:15,370
it's a battlefield of whether you win or lose.

1257
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:27,370
-Strike! -Strike three!

1258
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:30,170
With three players left on base, no points have been scored!

1259
01:23:30,170 --> 01:23:33,070
All they want to do is win,

1260
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:35,870
and win the championship.

1261
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:38,670
They have no feelings of profit or loss at this time.

1262
01:23:38,670 --> 01:23:41,170
It's just a very simple feeling.

1263
01:23:42,570 --> 01:23:47,170
And since you've been involved with baseball,

1264
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:49,870
you should already know of things like this.

1265
01:23:49,870 --> 01:23:51,570
Isn't that right?

1266
01:23:51,570 --> 01:23:55,270
Teito Jitsugyou High School's advisor for their baseball club,

1267
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:57,370
Mr. Yukio Torimitsu.

1268
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:08,470
Your son was run over,

1269
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:12,770
not because of the truck nor because of Koshien.

1270
01:24:12,770 --> 01:24:14,970
Your son tried too hard during club practice,

1271
01:24:14,970 --> 01:24:19,970
was pooped and braked too late.

1272
01:24:22,070 --> 01:24:23,970
Yeah, that's right.

1273
01:24:23,970 --> 01:24:25,770
I knew that.

1274
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:30,070
I knew it, but unless I blamed it on somebody,

1275
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:32,770
I couldn't stand it.

1276
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:35,370
I had to do so to calm my heart

1277
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:38,570
that had been torn apart from losing my beloved son.

1278
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:47,470
But you wouldn't let me push the bomb button after all.

1279
01:24:50,570 --> 01:24:58,170
You, as well as both those teams.

1280
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:03,470
Of course not.

1281
01:25:03,470 --> 01:25:07,970
This is a place where all the ones in Japan who hate to lose are gathered!

1282
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:10,770
He's right!

1283
01:25:10,770 --> 01:25:12,770
Shall we go, then?

1284
01:25:15,970 --> 01:25:17,770
The top of the 11th inning top,

1285
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:20,270
Ohgane High School will be batting.

1286
01:26:57,270 --> 01:27:00,270
Yes, that's right.

1287
01:27:00,270 --> 01:27:01,270
Yes.

1288
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:03,870
Okay, thank you.

1289
01:27:06,070 --> 01:27:08,970
Somebody from this jurisdiction will be coming to pick you up.

1290
01:27:13,070 --> 01:27:16,170
It's amazing how you deciphered that code

1291
01:27:16,170 --> 01:27:17,370
that I thought up at the spur of the moment.

1292
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:24,970
We figured out that 8, 1 and 2 was the Alps seat right away...

1293
01:27:24,970 --> 01:27:28,070
Thanks to the greatest man in Japan who likes to crack jokes.

1294
01:27:33,870 --> 01:27:35,070
What's up?

1295
01:27:35,070 --> 01:27:36,470
A cold?

1296
01:27:36,470 --> 01:27:39,070
Idiot! I'd never catch cold!

1297
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:41,170
This seat is in the outfield, you know?

1298
01:27:41,170 --> 01:27:43,370
It's not the Alps seat, you know?

1299
01:27:47,770 --> 01:27:49,270
Such a great joke!

1300
01:27:51,370 --> 01:27:53,070
Sure, sure.

1301
01:28:01,670 --> 01:28:03,670
Next Conan's Hint:

1302
01:28:03,670 --> 01:28:06,170
"Service Coupon"

1303
01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:07,170
