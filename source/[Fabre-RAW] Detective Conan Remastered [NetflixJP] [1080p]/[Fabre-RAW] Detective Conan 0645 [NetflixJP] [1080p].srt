1
00:00:03,026 --> 00:00:04,426
Due to Ran's absence,

2
00:00:04,426 --> 00:00:07,987
Pops and I end up eating out for dinner.

3
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:09,026
After seeing some flyers,

4
00:00:09,026 --> 00:00:12,426
we decided to head to Haido City for ramen.

5
00:00:12,426 --> 00:00:13,626
"Ramen So Good it's to Die For" "Ramen Ogura"

6
00:00:13,626 --> 00:00:16,526
Flaunting a "So Good it's to Die For" slogan,

7
00:00:16,526 --> 00:00:19,326
will this shabby-looking shop really be all right?

8
00:00:19,326 --> 00:00:22,726
And yet, Mr. Saizu, a customer who arrived after us

9
00:00:22,726 --> 00:00:26,526
was a real estate agent who plotted to land-shark this shopping street.

10
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:30,009
Alienated owner Ogura, assistant Sayo,

11
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:33,326
and the adjacent barbershop manager Taninaka,

12
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:34,826
he had soured the atmosphere.

13
00:00:36,326 --> 00:00:38,926
Despite its shabby appearance and a hostile atmosphere,

14
00:00:38,926 --> 00:00:41,526
the shop's ramen was one-of-a-kind.

15
00:00:41,526 --> 00:00:46,726
The slogan "So Good it's to Die For" was true to its words.

16
00:00:46,726 --> 00:00:50,029
However, after eating some of the ramen,

17
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:51,526
Mr. Saizu suddenly let out on anguished cry.

18
00:00:51,526 --> 00:00:53,326
And actually, died.

19
00:00:54,826 --> 00:00:58,037
The cause of death was hydrocyanic poisoning.

20
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:00,039
Was this murder?

21
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:04,626
If so, the culprit would have to be someone in this shop.

22
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:28,067
If all cases were men,

23
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:29,626
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

24
00:01:29,626 --> 00:01:31,326
Inspiration hits upon entering the shop.

25
00:01:31,326 --> 00:01:33,326
The Death Lord ramen shall speak of the truth.

26
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:34,926
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:34,926 --> 00:01:36,726
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:36,726 --> 00:01:39,026
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

29
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:09,034
"Ramen So Good it's to Die For (Part 2)"

30
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:13,234
Inspector.

31
00:03:15,134 --> 00:03:17,734
How'd it go? The investigation?

32
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:22,834
No poison was detected inside the ramen in question.

33
00:03:23,934 --> 00:03:26,934
Of course none was found in the water the victim drank

34
00:03:26,934 --> 00:03:30,189
or on the decorative flowers at the victim's seat,

35
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:32,534
or the glass they were arranged in.

36
00:03:32,534 --> 00:03:36,534
Which means Sayo and I are cleared from suspicion, right?

37
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:38,197
However...

38
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:41,434
On the thumb and index finger of the victim's left hand.

39
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:43,034
And on the chopsticks the victim used,

40
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:45,734
as well as atop the table at his seat,

41
00:03:45,734 --> 00:03:47,634
toxicity tests came back positive.

42
00:03:48,934 --> 00:03:52,211
Well, the poison detected on the chopsticks

43
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:53,434
and on the table were just a slight amount, though...

44
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:56,734
Also we found the same toxic powder

45
00:03:56,734 --> 00:03:59,534
from the inside pocket of the victim's jacket.

46
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:01,634
Would you have any clues?

47
00:04:01,634 --> 00:04:05,634
Such as, if you had seen Mr. Saizu put his hand in his inside pocket.

48
00:04:05,634 --> 00:04:08,834
Well, can't say that I have.

49
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:12,231
But if so, wouldn't that man have applied the poison

50
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:13,934
on his finger himself and licked it?

51
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:16,235
That reminds me, Mr. Saizu,

52
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:17,634
remarked before he collapsed...

53
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:19,934
"My company is going down in flames,

54
00:04:19,934 --> 00:04:22,534
that it makes me feel like dying."

55
00:04:22,534 --> 00:04:23,634
Now that you mention it,

56
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:26,234
that punk also went on about how he should poison our ramen

57
00:04:26,234 --> 00:04:27,834
and destroy our shop.

58
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,534
That's it.

59
00:04:29,534 --> 00:04:31,434
Bet he was trying to put poison in ramen

60
00:04:31,434 --> 00:04:33,734
but ended up accidentally ingesting it.

61
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:37,134
It seems that the possibility of this being a suicide

62
00:04:37,134 --> 00:04:39,434
-or an accident still exists. -That's true.

63
00:04:40,534 --> 00:04:42,261
Apologies, but Detective Mouri.

64
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:43,134
Yes.

65
00:04:43,134 --> 00:04:46,034
Could you come inside and explain everything once again?

66
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:47,234
Yes, sir.

67
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:50,269
-Then I'll go too. -No, you can't.

68
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:52,534
Kids shouldn't get in the way of the work of adults.

69
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:53,734
But...

70
00:04:55,234 --> 00:04:59,534
He's right, just let the detectives do their investigation.

71
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:01,834
It's not something for a kid to see.

72
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:05,334
Then, if you all would stand by outside for a few more mimutes.

73
00:05:05,334 --> 00:05:07,134
Wait.

74
00:05:07,134 --> 00:05:11,134
So there wasn't any poison on Mr. Saizu's other belongings,

75
00:05:11,134 --> 00:05:12,634
besides on his inside jacket pocket?

76
00:05:12,634 --> 00:05:13,934
Right.

77
00:05:13,934 --> 00:05:15,934
We examined his handkerchief, wallet,

78
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:17,834
cigarettes, and lighter,

79
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:20,934
even the glass that fell to the ground, but got nothing.

80
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:24,303
Then, was there anyone among the three

81
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:26,834
who had anything suspicious on them from the body search?

82
00:05:28,634 --> 00:05:31,734
Like a container that could've held the poison.

83
00:05:31,734 --> 00:05:33,534
No, here wasn't.

84
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:35,534
All Manager Ogure had on him

85
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:38,734
were cigarettes, a lighter, and a potable ashtray.

86
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:41,434
The part-timer, Ohashi had a cell phone,

87
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:44,334
a handkerchief, eye drops, and a purse.

88
00:05:44,334 --> 00:05:46,325
Mr. Taninaka from the barbershop

89
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:49,734
only had his wallet, glasses, and the keys to his shop.

90
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:51,934
And the contents of the eye drops?

91
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,034
We did examine that,

92
00:05:54,034 --> 00:05:56,134
but they were just ordinary eye drops.

93
00:05:56,134 --> 00:05:58,734
Incidentally, manager Ogura's cigarettes

94
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:01,234
were just enough for a quick puff after closing.

95
00:06:01,234 --> 00:06:03,634
And Mr. Taninaka's glasses are apparently reading glasses

96
00:06:03,634 --> 00:06:05,534
that he seldom wears.

97
00:06:05,534 --> 00:06:08,347
And by the way, when Mr. Saizu collapsed,

98
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,034
Mr. Ogura said,

99
00:06:10,034 --> 00:06:13,634
"Idiot, think we've gonna fall for that same trick again?"

100
00:06:13,634 --> 00:06:16,034
But have there been other cases like this?

101
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:19,334
Yes, seems it has happened twice.

102
00:06:19,334 --> 00:06:22,361
The first time,

103
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:26,834
Ms. Ohashi called an ambulance and it caused a big commotion.

104
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:29,534
But it was deemed a malingering by the hospital.

105
00:06:29,534 --> 00:06:34,373
The second time, Mr. Ogura and Mr. Taninaka who happened to be there

106
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:36,375
threw a collapsed customer out of the shop.

107
00:06:36,534 --> 00:06:38,134
And that customer picked himself up,

108
00:06:38,134 --> 00:06:40,379
cursed them and left.

109
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,934
Well, I was told that these two customers

110
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:47,634
were both hired by Mr. Saizu to cause trouble.

111
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:52,934
Then, I'll go back inside and continue with the investigation.

112
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:54,393
Hold on, wait.

113
00:06:54,634 --> 00:06:56,934
I still have questions to ask you...

114
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:01,734
Hey, not again.

115
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:04,034
I told you to wait outside.

116
00:07:04,034 --> 00:07:06,934
Boy, you've watched too many mystery dramas.

117
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:10,734
Think you're like the young Kobayashi of the Boy Detective's Squad?

118
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:15,034
No, rather than young Kobayashi,

119
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,134
I feel like t Kogoro Akechi,

120
00:07:17,134 --> 00:07:19,534
who has seen right through the truth.

121
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:25,734
Well, according to our investigation,

122
00:07:25,734 --> 00:07:30,429
there was no poison inside of the ramen the deceased Saizu ate.

123
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:34,234
Neither did the water nor the glass that was brought to him

124
00:07:34,234 --> 00:07:38,234
before he ordered ramen.

125
00:07:38,234 --> 00:07:40,134
Nor the decorative flowers on the seat where Mr. Saizu sat,

126
00:07:40,134 --> 00:07:42,441
nor the glass they were arranged in.

127
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:44,434
Poison was detected, however,

128
00:07:44,434 --> 00:07:49,034
on the left-handed Saizu's left thumb and left index finger.

129
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:52,834
Although there was also poison detected on the chopsticks he used

130
00:07:52,834 --> 00:07:54,234
and on the tabletop where he sat,

131
00:07:54,234 --> 00:07:56,455
we can exclude those due to the minute amount found.

132
00:07:56,455 --> 00:07:59,334
Also out of Mr. Saizu's belongings,

133
00:07:59,334 --> 00:08:00,734
no poison was on his handkerchief, wallet,

134
00:08:00,734 --> 00:08:04,463
glasses, cigarettes, or lighter.

135
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:09,334
But we found powdered poison in his inside jacket pocket.

136
00:08:09,334 --> 00:08:11,834
Further, the fact that before Mr. Saizu died,

137
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:13,734
he said things like, "I feel like dying"

138
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:17,434
and "I'll destroy this shop by poisoning the ramen",

139
00:08:17,434 --> 00:08:19,034
if we take those into account,

140
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:21,034
Mr. Saizu would've most likely

141
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,634
touched the poison he put in his inside jacket pocket,

142
00:08:23,634 --> 00:08:25,034
and either committed suicide

143
00:08:25,034 --> 00:08:29,434
or was plotting to lace the ramen with poison.

144
00:08:29,434 --> 00:08:32,491
Thus, this case is not a homicide.

145
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:34,493
Inspector.

146
00:08:35,534 --> 00:08:37,634
Other than on Saizu's fingers,

147
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:40,499
wasn't there poison on the chopsticks and table?

148
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:43,234
In that case, wouldn't it be too early

149
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:45,134
to determine that it wasn't a homicide?

150
00:08:45,134 --> 00:08:47,734
Saizu was sitting at the seat of the regular customer

151
00:08:47,734 --> 00:08:49,534
who died a short while ago.

152
00:08:49,534 --> 00:08:51,534
And it seems that Saizu often purposely sat at that seat

153
00:08:51,534 --> 00:08:54,834
as a form of harassment, so...

154
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:58,534
Even if his seat could've been predicted in advance,

155
00:08:58,534 --> 00:09:00,519
the conclusion is the same.

156
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:01,934
I already said this,

157
00:09:01,934 --> 00:09:04,034
but the amount of poison detected on the chopsticks

158
00:09:04,034 --> 00:09:05,734
and table was insignificant.

159
00:09:05,734 --> 00:09:07,034
We've no choice but to think he touched those

160
00:09:07,034 --> 00:09:09,434
with his poison-laced hand.

161
00:09:09,434 --> 00:09:11,334
Not to mention, the other chopsticks

162
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:14,134
in the chopstick stand had no poison on them, right?

163
00:09:14,134 --> 00:09:17,034
It would've been impossible to pinpoint

164
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:18,537
a place on the chopsticks or table for the victim to touch.

165
00:09:18,734 --> 00:09:21,034
Good point.

166
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:26,234
Ramen...

167
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:27,734
pardon me...

168
00:09:31,434 --> 00:09:32,551
Detective Mouri?

169
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:36,834
He's gotten into his usual trance-like state.

170
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:39,634
It's just me putting him to sleep with my tranquilizer gun.

171
00:09:39,634 --> 00:09:41,834
Hey, is he all right?

172
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:44,563
His dizziness looked pretty awful, didn't it?

173
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:48,334
Almost as if he was a puppet who had his strings cut.

174
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:51,334
Right, a puppet indeed.

175
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:52,934
I didn't mean me,

176
00:09:52,934 --> 00:09:55,934
but Mr. Saizu did have someone pulling his strings.

177
00:09:55,934 --> 00:09:58,034
From the time he entered this shop,

178
00:09:58,034 --> 00:10:00,579
it was as if he'd been possessed by a devil

179
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:02,581
to apply poison to his own fingers,

180
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:05,134
and then bring it to his mouth.

181
00:10:05,134 --> 00:10:09,234
Just as the culprit among us expected.

182
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:13,034
Are you telling me that one of these three

183
00:10:13,034 --> 00:10:15,534
is a hypnotist or something of the sort?

184
00:10:15,534 --> 00:10:19,734
No, to say that he had been possessed by a devil was just a metaphor.

185
00:10:19,734 --> 00:10:22,601
The truth is the culprit took advantage

186
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:24,603
of the fact that people under a certain condition

187
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:28,607
would invariably do something specific upon entering a ramen shop.

188
00:10:29,634 --> 00:10:32,234
Invariably do something specific?

189
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:34,613
Don't tell me you mean every customer that enters a ramen shop

190
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:38,617
will put their hand into their inside jacket pocket.

191
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:40,234
The poison in his inside pocket

192
00:10:40,234 --> 00:10:41,634
was a fake planted by the culprit,

193
00:10:41,634 --> 00:10:44,134
in order to make it look like a suicide.

194
00:10:44,134 --> 00:10:45,434
The culprit probably prepared

195
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:49,134
something very similar to one of Saizu's belongings.

196
00:10:49,134 --> 00:10:50,629
Applied poison on it,

197
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:54,334
and switched the two during the confusion after the incident.

198
00:10:54,334 --> 00:10:56,334
By "switched" you mean...

199
00:10:56,334 --> 00:11:00,134
I bet the culprit still has it on him.

200
00:11:00,134 --> 00:11:03,734
Mr. Saizu's belongings with the poison on them.

201
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:08,334
Then, we'll check them again.

202
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,834
There's a way to figure it out soon

203
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:11,434
even without doing that.

204
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:18,234
Just have them use these items the same way Mr. Saizu did.

205
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:19,634
I see.

206
00:11:19,634 --> 00:11:21,734
If forced to use an item of Mr. Saizu's,

207
00:11:21,734 --> 00:11:23,634
which the culprit wasn't used to using,

208
00:11:23,634 --> 00:11:26,134
they'd likely give themselves away, yes?

209
00:11:26,134 --> 00:11:30,234
Right. If I recall, all three people have something

210
00:11:30,234 --> 00:11:33,234
that duplicated what Mr. Saizu had.

211
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:37,334
Mr. Ogura had cigarettes and a lighter.

212
00:11:37,334 --> 00:11:39,434
Sayo had a handkerchief...

213
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:42,134
Mr. Taninaka had a wallet and glasses.

214
00:11:49,487 --> 00:11:50,689
Then...

215
00:11:50,887 --> 00:11:54,387
Let's have Mr. Ogura light one of his cigarettes,

216
00:11:54,387 --> 00:11:56,695
Sayo fold your handkerchief

217
00:11:56,695 --> 00:12:00,987
and Mr. Taninaka, for the time being, put on your glasses.

218
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,787
Of course, in the same manner as the left-handed Mr. Saizu.

219
00:12:03,787 --> 00:12:05,187
With your left hands.

220
00:12:06,387 --> 00:12:08,387
All right, everyone, if you would please.

221
00:12:11,387 --> 00:12:13,087
But, see here...

222
00:12:13,087 --> 00:12:15,787
You said the culprit would be revealed this away, but...

223
00:12:15,787 --> 00:12:18,487
Since we're originally right-handed...

224
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,887
There's no way we could do it well with our left hands.

225
00:12:23,587 --> 00:12:25,387
What's the matter, sir?

226
00:12:25,387 --> 00:12:27,287
Your glasses are crooked?

227
00:12:27,287 --> 00:12:28,727
Like I said,

228
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:31,387
I can't really put them on correctly with my left hand.

229
00:12:31,387 --> 00:12:34,387
It's because you're not firmly holding the connective point

230
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:37,487
where the frame and temple meet, like this.

231
00:12:37,487 --> 00:12:39,787
So can you try putting them on again?

232
00:12:42,087 --> 00:12:44,087
I've got no choice.

233
00:12:45,887 --> 00:12:47,687
There you go again.

234
00:12:47,687 --> 00:12:50,749
You're grabbing onto the end of the temple.

235
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:54,487
Why aren't you holding over here?

236
00:12:54,487 --> 00:12:56,755
It's just...

237
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:58,757
Or...

238
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:00,087
You just won't hold it there?

239
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:02,761
Since that's where the poison is?

240
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:09,387
Officer Takagi, check those glasses.

241
00:13:09,387 --> 00:13:10,769
Yes, sir.

242
00:13:12,387 --> 00:13:13,887
If you would please...

243
00:13:17,387 --> 00:13:20,787
But, isn't this strange?

244
00:13:20,787 --> 00:13:22,187
Since Taninaka came into this shop,

245
00:13:22,187 --> 00:13:26,187
he never even came close to Saizu.

246
00:13:26,187 --> 00:13:27,787
That's right.

247
00:13:28,987 --> 00:13:31,187
In between Mr. Taninaka and that man was the little boy's group,

248
00:13:31,187 --> 00:13:34,487
there's no way he could've ever touched,

249
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:37,187
or even come close to that man, is there?

250
00:13:37,187 --> 00:13:40,387
So, how on earth could he have laced poison onto his glasses?

251
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:41,487
She's right.

252
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,387
True, it would've been difficult for him to do so here.

253
00:13:45,387 --> 00:13:47,787
But if Mr. Taninaka did it in his barbershop,

254
00:13:47,787 --> 00:13:49,987
it would've been an easy task.

255
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:53,887
Come to think of it, he did say this.

256
00:13:53,887 --> 00:13:57,387
That Mr. Saizu had his hair cut at Taninaka's barbershop

257
00:13:57,387 --> 00:14:00,187
just before he came here to eat ramen.

258
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:01,387
Yes.

259
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:04,387
At a barbershop, it's only natural for the barber

260
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:06,187
to hold onto your glasses and jacket

261
00:14:06,187 --> 00:14:08,487
while your hair is being cut.

262
00:14:08,487 --> 00:14:11,787
Mr. Taninaka would've had enough opportunities

263
00:14:11,787 --> 00:14:16,835
to poison his glasses and plant poison in his jacket.

264
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:18,837
No way.

265
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:21,287
We'll concede for argument's sake,

266
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:24,387
but how the heck was he able to make Saizu touch it?

267
00:14:24,387 --> 00:14:27,387
Since it wasn't like he was hypnotized or anything,

268
00:14:27,387 --> 00:14:29,587
no way he'd so conveniently touch it.

269
00:14:29,587 --> 00:14:31,487
He definitely would touch it!

270
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:37,487
Hey, when in the world did you get outside?

271
00:14:37,487 --> 00:14:41,487
Because a person wearing glasses...

272
00:14:41,487 --> 00:14:44,487
walk into ramen shops or warm places,

273
00:14:44,487 --> 00:14:45,787
immediately...

274
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,587
this will happen.

275
00:14:51,887 --> 00:14:52,871
Condensation?

276
00:14:56,587 --> 00:15:00,287
And, if your glasses cloud up,

277
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:02,187
normally you'll do this.

278
00:15:02,187 --> 00:15:03,387
I see.

279
00:15:03,387 --> 00:15:04,883
If his glasses clouded up due to condensation,

280
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:06,885
he would've taken them off in order to wipe them

281
00:15:07,087 --> 00:15:09,287
with a handkerchief or something.

282
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:12,087
That's when the poison got onto his finger.

283
00:15:12,087 --> 00:15:15,387
However, Mr. Saizu was left-handed.

284
00:15:15,387 --> 00:15:17,587
If he took his handkerchief and wiped his glasses using his left hand,

285
00:15:17,587 --> 00:15:20,087
poison should've also gotten on to his handkerchief.

286
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:23,987
Mr. Saizu was ambidextrous.

287
00:15:23,987 --> 00:15:27,987
He said that his parents tried to correct his left-handedness.

288
00:15:27,987 --> 00:15:31,887
That's why he used his right hand to wipe the spilled water on the table.

289
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:35,387
But he wasn't comfortable unless he ate using his left hand.

290
00:15:35,387 --> 00:15:39,187
In short, when Mr. Saizu entered this shop,

291
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:41,987
he took out his handkerchief with his right hand

292
00:15:41,987 --> 00:15:44,923
and wiped his glasses.

293
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:49,287
Not at all expecting that poison had been applied to his glasses.

294
00:15:49,287 --> 00:15:52,931
But, if he had used his left hand

295
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:54,687
to take out his handkerchief...

296
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,287
That's possible.

297
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:57,587
Since Saizu was ambidextrous,

298
00:15:57,587 --> 00:15:59,987
there's an equal chance for him to use either hand to take it out.

299
00:15:59,987 --> 00:16:05,887
No, the handkerchief was inside his jacket's left chest pocket.

300
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,687
Since he's ambidextrous he'd use his right hand

301
00:16:07,687 --> 00:16:10,687
to take it out since it'd be easier.

302
00:16:10,687 --> 00:16:13,387
As for the tabletop having traces of poison,

303
00:16:13,387 --> 00:16:14,953
it was because he touched it with his left hand

304
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:17,687
while seating himself.

305
00:16:17,687 --> 00:16:19,687
Then, as he was ready to eat ramen

306
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,887
and took chopsticks from the chopstick stand,

307
00:16:21,887 --> 00:16:24,387
some poison also got on there.

308
00:16:24,387 --> 00:16:27,287
As he used his mouth to split apart the chopsticks,

309
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:30,087
poison stuck onto his lips and teeth.

310
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:32,587
As soon as he slurped up his ramen,

311
00:16:32,587 --> 00:16:36,687
the poison entered his system just like that.

312
00:16:36,687 --> 00:16:40,987
Incidentally, the reason Mr. Taninaka passed the chopsticks to us

313
00:16:40,987 --> 00:16:43,587
is because he didn't want Mr. Saizu to do so.

314
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:48,087
If he had used his poisoned hand to pass the chopsticks to us,

315
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:51,587
we might have also been poisoned to death.

316
00:16:51,587 --> 00:16:53,687
So, you're saying that he came to the shop

317
00:16:53,687 --> 00:16:56,995
to make sure no innocent customers would get dragged into it?

318
00:16:56,995 --> 00:16:58,987
But, wait...

319
00:16:58,987 --> 00:17:02,287
Just when could Taninaka have switched the glasses?

320
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,187
If he hadn't switched them,

321
00:17:04,187 --> 00:17:05,887
the trick would've been disclosed in no time.

322
00:17:05,887 --> 00:17:07,887
Switching the glasses was done

323
00:17:07,887 --> 00:17:11,587
when Mr. Ogura and Mr. Taninaka

324
00:17:11,587 --> 00:17:14,187
were about to throw the collapsed Saizu out of the shop.

325
00:17:14,187 --> 00:17:17,387
At the time, Mr. Saizu collapsed,

326
00:17:17,387 --> 00:17:19,387
the glasses flew to the ground near his legs.

327
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:22,787
We squatted near Saizu's legs

328
00:17:22,787 --> 00:17:25,587
in order to lift the lower part of the body.

329
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,287
As for Mr. Taninaka,

330
00:17:27,287 --> 00:17:28,787
he had the opportunity to switch the glasses

331
00:17:28,787 --> 00:17:30,187
and block our view with his body.

332
00:17:31,187 --> 00:17:35,487
But, wasn't it only by chance that his glasses flew off?

333
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,387
If his glasses had remained firmly on his face,

334
00:17:37,387 --> 00:17:40,387
wouldn't it have been difficult to switch them?

335
00:17:40,387 --> 00:17:45,043
Of the two incidents of food poisoning that had occurred in this shop...

336
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:46,387
The second time,

337
00:17:46,387 --> 00:17:48,687
Mr. Ogura and Mr. Taninaka threw the customer

338
00:17:48,687 --> 00:17:52,587
who had pretended to have food poisoning out of the shop.

339
00:17:52,587 --> 00:17:54,787
So this time, he could predict

340
00:17:54,787 --> 00:17:58,787
that Mr. Ogura would do the same thing when Saizu collapsed.

341
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,587
He knew that Mr. Ogura would ask him to help

342
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:03,061
throw Saizu out into the street.

343
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:04,587
This time, it was by luck

344
00:18:04,587 --> 00:18:07,065
that a detective drama-obsessed brat with glasses blurted out,

345
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:09,387
"Don't touch the body."

346
00:18:09,387 --> 00:18:11,487
But had it not been for that,

347
00:18:11,487 --> 00:18:13,071
he would have plenty of chances to switch them.

348
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:15,387
After they cast him out of the shop,

349
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:17,487
he could fetch the glasses that had fallen to the ground

350
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:21,087
or he could rush to the unresponsive Mr. Saizu and do it.

351
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:24,787
Inspector Megure.

352
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:28,587
The glasses Taninaka had on him tested positive for poison.

353
00:18:30,287 --> 00:18:32,587
It appears that we've obtained

354
00:18:32,587 --> 00:18:35,587
conclusive evidence against you, Mr. Taninaka.

355
00:18:36,887 --> 00:18:39,087
Hold on.

356
00:18:39,087 --> 00:18:41,087
There's some kind of mistake.

357
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:42,687
That's right.

358
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:45,103
Mr. Taninaka wouldn't kill anyone.

359
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:48,087
That's enough, you two.

360
00:18:48,087 --> 00:18:51,587
I don't deserve the privilege of your defense.

361
00:18:51,587 --> 00:18:52,687
-What? -What?

362
00:18:53,987 --> 00:18:56,887
To kill Saizu in this shop

363
00:18:56,887 --> 00:19:00,487
and hopefully thereby ruin this shop was my plan.

364
00:19:02,187 --> 00:19:04,787
I thought that no one would come to a ramen shop

365
00:19:04,787 --> 00:19:07,125
where someone had been poisoned to death.

366
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,987
But... why'd you do that?

367
00:19:09,987 --> 00:19:13,987
Haven't we gotten by pretty well these twenty years as neighbors?

368
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,987
Gotten by pretty well?

369
00:19:17,987 --> 00:19:20,087
In these past 20 years,

370
00:19:20,087 --> 00:19:23,487
just what have you achieved?

371
00:19:23,487 --> 00:19:26,187
We worked our rears and souls off in order to raise money,

372
00:19:26,187 --> 00:19:32,087
all for the sake of making this Haido Shopping Street a stylish place.

373
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:35,687
But you haven't remodeled your shop even once.

374
00:19:35,687 --> 00:19:39,687
I told you, I don't have the money.

375
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:43,687
Horse-racing, boat-races, road races,

376
00:19:43,687 --> 00:19:45,487
if you had only let up on those a little,

377
00:19:45,487 --> 00:19:47,587
you could've saved up some, no?

378
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,687
That's...

379
00:19:50,687 --> 00:19:52,287
If you ask my opinion,

380
00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:56,287
your profit margin on the ramen was way too low.

381
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:59,987
Without raising the price, you even hired a part-time worker,

382
00:19:59,987 --> 00:20:03,181
you just don't have any business sense.

383
00:20:04,387 --> 00:20:06,387
Saizu said it, right?

384
00:20:06,387 --> 00:20:08,587
That the people of the shopping street

385
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:10,987
were calling this shop the black sheep.

386
00:20:10,987 --> 00:20:14,487
That was actually true.

387
00:20:14,487 --> 00:20:16,887
They asked me many times

388
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:20,187
if I could be the one to tell you,

389
00:20:20,187 --> 00:20:24,087
"Please either remodel the shop or leave".

390
00:20:26,587 --> 00:20:30,487
Then, why didn't you tell us that outright?

391
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:33,211
If you had, our owner could have...

392
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:35,213
I couldn't tell you.

393
00:20:36,387 --> 00:20:39,787
Because I loved the ramen here.

394
00:20:39,787 --> 00:20:41,487
Without regard to profit,

395
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:43,987
you steadfastly kept the same taste and price.

396
00:20:43,987 --> 00:20:46,887
Your spirit as an owner radiated.

397
00:20:53,787 --> 00:20:56,787
All right, we'll get the rest at the station.

398
00:21:05,687 --> 00:21:07,887
This is my heart talking now,

399
00:21:07,887 --> 00:21:10,087
but I believed in you guys.

400
00:21:12,387 --> 00:21:15,987
With your ramen, even if you moved elsewhere,

401
00:21:19,687 --> 00:21:22,487
you'd definitely keep on prospering.

402
00:22:57,355 --> 00:22:59,357
One month later,

403
00:22:59,357 --> 00:23:03,787
Barbershop Taninaka and Ramen Ogura were both demolished.

404
00:23:03,787 --> 00:23:05,387
And the ramen that was so good it was to die for

405
00:23:05,387 --> 00:23:07,787
vanished from Haido City.

406
00:23:07,787 --> 00:23:09,087
Then...

407
00:23:17,587 --> 00:23:20,687
Hello. Hey, welcome.

408
00:23:20,687 --> 00:23:22,087
It's you guys.

409
00:23:22,087 --> 00:23:23,381
Welcome.

410
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:27,385
I hear you're a well-known detective here in Beika City.

411
00:23:27,385 --> 00:23:29,687
Yes, sort of...

412
00:23:29,687 --> 00:23:32,287
Shouldn't I be well-known throughout the nation?

413
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:34,987
Your shop is new,

414
00:23:34,987 --> 00:23:38,087
but things look exactly the same as they were before.

415
00:23:38,087 --> 00:23:39,387
Something did change.

416
00:23:39,387 --> 00:23:41,187
The signboard in front.

417
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:43,787
The owner arranged it to suit the latest trend.

418
00:23:44,987 --> 00:23:46,587
The signboard?

419
00:23:50,587 --> 00:23:51,409
"Wicked"

420
00:23:51,587 --> 00:23:55,887
"So wicked it's to die for" "Ramen Ogura"

421
00:23:57,187 --> 00:24:00,087
"So wicked it's to die for"?

422
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

423
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,998
"Elevator".

424
00:24:05,998 --> 00:24:08,498
In the next episode, a new detective-like character will appear.

425
00:24:08,498 --> 00:24:09,427
But aren't I more than enough?

426
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:10,640
No, not at all, I'm a bit uneasy.
