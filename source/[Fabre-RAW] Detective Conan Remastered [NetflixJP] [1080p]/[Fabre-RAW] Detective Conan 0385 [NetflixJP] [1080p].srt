1
00:00:22,972 --> 00:00:24,572
Today's stage is a musical family's mansion.

2
00:00:24,572 --> 00:00:25,872
A famed musical instrument plays the melody of murder.

3
00:00:25,872 --> 00:00:27,972
That befalls the violinist.

4
00:00:27,972 --> 00:00:29,572
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:31,272
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,272 --> 00:00:33,172
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:59,884
What? The area code for Tottori Prefecture?

8
00:01:59,884 --> 00:02:01,984
What's up?

9
00:02:01,984 --> 00:02:03,784
I mentioned it before, didn't I?

10
00:02:03,784 --> 00:02:05,484
During the incident that happened in Okinawa,

11
00:02:05,484 --> 00:02:08,584
that I was concerned about the phone call that Mr. Motoyama was making.

12
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:11,084
He called a place is Tottori called "Kurayoshi"

13
00:02:11,084 --> 00:02:13,384
And in the incident before that.

14
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:16,884
Police Detective Yamamura called a place in Tottori

15
00:02:16,884 --> 00:02:19,584
where his grandmother lives called "Yazu"

16
00:02:19,584 --> 00:02:21,184
What they both have in common

17
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:24,084
is that their area code is "0858".

18
00:02:24,084 --> 00:02:26,784
Which means...

19
00:02:26,784 --> 00:02:28,684
I have a feeling it's the same...

20
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:35,784
as the mail address that Bellmot sent to her people.

21
00:02:35,784 --> 00:02:36,784
What?

22
00:02:36,784 --> 00:02:39,184
Besides, I don't think it's just some ordinary person.

23
00:02:39,184 --> 00:02:40,884
If I remember correctly, I heard,

24
00:02:40,884 --> 00:02:43,584
the words that she mumbled back then was...

25
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,284
"Okay, boss".

26
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:48,984
Then, don't tell me that the number is...

27
00:02:48,984 --> 00:02:52,384
Yeah, this number 0858 may be

28
00:02:52,384 --> 00:02:54,984
the mail address that connects

29
00:02:54,984 --> 00:02:58,084
to the boss that controls all of them.

30
00:02:58,084 --> 00:02:59,284
But...

31
00:02:59,284 --> 00:03:02,884
Only the top four numbers seem to be the same.

32
00:03:02,884 --> 00:03:05,484
Besides, although the numbers are the same 0858,

33
00:03:05,484 --> 00:03:08,884
I feel there is some very slight difference.

34
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:10,184
"Mouri Detective Agency" -I'm home.

35
00:03:10,184 --> 00:03:12,084
Hi.

36
00:03:12,084 --> 00:03:15,784
Hey, Ran, do you know what this melody is?

37
00:03:17,684 --> 00:03:18,984
What's that?

38
00:03:19,984 --> 00:03:22,184
Oh, a quiz that's the talk of the town now.

39
00:03:27,784 --> 00:03:30,584
"Fa, mi, re, mi" right?

40
00:03:30,584 --> 00:03:32,084
Maybe it's "so-fa-mi-fa?"

41
00:03:32,084 --> 00:03:34,384
It's "ti-la-so-la"

42
00:03:34,384 --> 00:03:35,684
although I'm a bit off.

43
00:03:35,684 --> 00:03:38,384
My, you're really confident, aren't you?

44
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,984
Then try singing it.

45
00:03:43,284 --> 00:03:46,984
Do re mi...

46
00:03:46,984 --> 00:03:52,884
Fa so la ti do.

47
00:03:52,884 --> 00:03:54,784
-Wow, talk about off key. -Two horses away, no three.

48
00:03:54,784 --> 00:03:56,984
-But, I'm definite that it's ti-la-so-la. -Aozora Hikarin is in the lead.

49
00:03:56,984 --> 00:03:58,584
-No, it's Fa-mi-re-mi. -Aozora Hikarin is in the lead.

50
00:03:58,584 --> 00:04:00,484
Come off it! Cut out the noise!

51
00:04:00,484 --> 00:04:02,284
I'll ask those people later for you,

52
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,084
so cut out the noise.

53
00:04:04,084 --> 00:04:05,984
Ask who?

54
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:09,984
The people that I'm going to see after this is a family of musicians.

55
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:15,084
And there's a composer with perfect-pitch among them.

56
00:04:15,084 --> 00:04:17,584
Perfect pitch.

57
00:04:19,984 --> 00:04:25,184
"Cacophony of Stradivarius! Prelude!"

58
00:04:28,384 --> 00:04:30,884
Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

59
00:04:30,884 --> 00:04:34,984
I don't see Mr. Shitara having an appointment with anyone by that name.

60
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:39,784
Well, I was asked to come here by his granddaughter Hasuki Shitara.

61
00:04:39,784 --> 00:04:42,184
"Benio Tsumagari (54), Steward for the Shitara family" -I see.

62
00:04:42,184 --> 00:04:46,484
Hasuki is at the annex practicing right now.

63
00:04:46,484 --> 00:04:48,484
See, you can hear her playing?

64
00:04:49,684 --> 00:04:52,084
So the music that's been playing all this time

65
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:54,084
was a live performance.

66
00:04:54,084 --> 00:04:55,784
How fantastic.

67
00:04:56,884 --> 00:04:59,184
I don't know what kind of appointment you have,

68
00:04:59,184 --> 00:05:01,884
but please make sure you do not get in the way of her practice,

69
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:05,584
because she has an important concert performance tonight.

70
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:09,084
Which means tonight is some special occasion?

71
00:05:09,084 --> 00:05:12,784
It is Mr. Shitara's 72nd birthday.

72
00:05:27,484 --> 00:05:29,484
"Hasuki Shitara (23), Choichiro's granddaughter"

73
00:05:29,484 --> 00:05:31,484
Hasuki.

74
00:05:31,484 --> 00:05:33,784
This is Mr. Mouri here to see you.

75
00:05:35,384 --> 00:05:39,284
Yes, I'm glad. You really did come.

76
00:05:39,284 --> 00:05:44,784
Well, of course, if for a beautiful lady like you.

77
00:05:46,384 --> 00:05:50,384
Are you the one with the perfect-pitch, Miss?

78
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,184
That's not me.

79
00:05:53,184 --> 00:05:55,384
Hey, hey, are you sure it's okay, Hasuki,

80
00:05:55,384 --> 00:05:57,884
to slack off practice?

81
00:05:57,884 --> 00:06:00,484
"Genzaburo Shitara (60)" -You're the one who's performing tonight, right?

82
00:06:00,484 --> 00:06:02,084
"Choichiro's younger brother" -Using the you know what...

83
00:06:02,084 --> 00:06:03,584
Yes.

84
00:06:03,584 --> 00:06:07,084
If you goof, you're going to get it from big brother.

85
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:09,984
Genzaburo, I would really like you to let us know beforehand

86
00:06:09,984 --> 00:06:13,084
if you're coming home.

87
00:06:13,084 --> 00:06:14,584
Come on.

88
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:18,584
I came all this way after leaving in the middle of the orchestra meeting.

89
00:06:19,984 --> 00:06:22,784
I'd like to take a snooze for a while.

90
00:06:22,784 --> 00:06:26,084
Will you wake me like always when the birthday party starts?

91
00:06:27,284 --> 00:06:30,184
I hope you haven't touched anything in my room without my permission?

92
00:06:30,184 --> 00:06:34,984
No, because I don't want to be yelled at by you like your late wife.

93
00:06:34,984 --> 00:06:36,084
I see.

94
00:06:38,184 --> 00:06:43,384
Miss, is that man the person with the perfect-pitch?

95
00:06:43,384 --> 00:06:47,884
Nope. Grand-Uncle Genzaburo is a famous conductor,

96
00:06:47,884 --> 00:06:50,684
but he says he does not have perfect pitch.

97
00:06:50,684 --> 00:06:52,184
The one who has perfect pitch is...

98
00:06:52,184 --> 00:06:55,484
Ti-so-ti-so.

99
00:06:55,484 --> 00:06:57,284
Ti-so.

100
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:00,184
"Kyosuke Haga (32), Choichiro's nephew" -Oops, I went flat on "ti".

101
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:03,584
Sorry, an ambulance just went by.

102
00:07:03,584 --> 00:07:05,984
About yesterday's music,

103
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:10,284
could you make the BPM from 120-130.

104
00:07:10,284 --> 00:07:12,084
I want it to be a bit more lively.

105
00:07:12,084 --> 00:07:13,084
Right, right.

106
00:07:13,084 --> 00:07:14,984
Could it be him?

107
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:17,984
Yes, he's the one with the perfect-pitch.

108
00:07:17,984 --> 00:07:21,884
He is a genius composer and in charge of soundtracks for several dramas.

109
00:07:21,884 --> 00:07:24,784
He's Kyosuke Haga, my uncle.

110
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,084
Are you talking about me?

111
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:36,084
Yes?

112
00:07:36,084 --> 00:07:39,584
Can you tell me what the notes are?

113
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,584
Uncle.

114
00:07:41,584 --> 00:07:43,984
How did you like what I played?

115
00:07:43,984 --> 00:07:48,284
It was good, although you were 1/4th pitch flat on a note.

116
00:07:48,284 --> 00:07:50,684
I prefer it that way, though.

117
00:07:50,684 --> 00:07:52,484
Thank you!

118
00:07:54,684 --> 00:07:56,684
Yes, hello.

119
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,084
You mean that piece.

120
00:07:59,084 --> 00:08:01,984
I'd like to break the notes up a bit more.

121
00:08:01,984 --> 00:08:04,184
Can you handle it?

122
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:05,984
What I'm trying to say is...

123
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:08,284
Furuto!

124
00:08:08,284 --> 00:08:10,684
Where are you?

125
00:08:10,684 --> 00:08:11,884
Furuto!

126
00:08:12,884 --> 00:08:14,584
Grandmother?

127
00:08:14,584 --> 00:08:17,084
I hear the sound of the violin playing.

128
00:08:17,084 --> 00:08:18,684
"Ayane Shitara (68)" -Furuto, don't hide

129
00:08:18,684 --> 00:08:20,284
"Choichiro's wife" -and come out here.

130
00:08:20,284 --> 00:08:22,284
Grandmother, not again.

131
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:24,984
Father passed away last year today,

132
00:08:24,984 --> 00:08:26,484
have you forgotten?

133
00:08:26,484 --> 00:08:27,984
Last year today?

134
00:08:27,984 --> 00:08:30,884
No, Furuto is still...

135
00:08:30,884 --> 00:08:33,384
Hey, Ayane, how unsightly!

136
00:08:33,384 --> 00:08:34,584
Grandfather.

137
00:08:34,584 --> 00:08:37,884
"Choichiro Shitara (72)" -Going after the shadow of the dead for so long.

138
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,684
"The head of the Shitara family" -Our son Furuto has returned to dust.

139
00:08:40,684 --> 00:08:42,884
Don't you understand after all this time!

140
00:08:42,884 --> 00:08:46,784
Grandfather, you were told by the doctor not to walk around.

141
00:08:46,784 --> 00:08:48,484
-Mr. Mouri. -Yes.

142
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:52,384
I'm sorry but I'm going to take care of the two for now,

143
00:08:52,384 --> 00:08:53,984
so I'll meet you at the main house later.

144
00:08:53,984 --> 00:08:55,984
I'd like to talk to you there.

145
00:08:55,984 --> 00:08:57,984
I've got something I'd like to show you.

146
00:09:27,584 --> 00:09:30,884
This violin seems to have been used over a long period of time.

147
00:09:30,884 --> 00:09:35,084
Yes, it's been made about 300 year ago.

148
00:09:35,084 --> 00:09:37,884
This sure is some antique then.

149
00:09:42,984 --> 00:09:45,284
The one who made it is an Italian

150
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,484
by the name of Antonio Stradivari.

151
00:09:48,484 --> 00:09:51,184
Stradivari...

152
00:09:51,184 --> 00:09:52,484
You mean that famous...

153
00:09:52,484 --> 00:09:54,084
Just as I thought.

154
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:56,484
Stradivarius?

155
00:09:56,484 --> 00:10:00,284
Doesn't this cost several billion yen?

156
00:10:00,284 --> 00:10:03,884
The legendary and famed musical instrument.

157
00:10:03,884 --> 00:10:06,284
Let go of it, Dad, quickly!

158
00:10:06,284 --> 00:10:08,684
My body's frozen in place that I,

159
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:10,384
I can't let go of it.

160
00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:13,384
-What? Oh come on. -Yes. Yes.

161
00:10:19,684 --> 00:10:20,784
And...

162
00:10:20,784 --> 00:10:23,984
what about this legendary musical instrument?

163
00:10:23,984 --> 00:10:24,984
Well...

164
00:10:26,484 --> 00:10:29,584
This violin is what Danjiro Shitara,

165
00:10:29,584 --> 00:10:32,384
Uncle Kyosuke Haga's father had given as a gift

166
00:10:32,384 --> 00:10:36,984
to Grandfather Choichiro, his older brother.

167
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:39,284
Despite being the son of blood-related brothers,

168
00:10:39,284 --> 00:10:41,584
why is his last name Haga?

169
00:10:41,584 --> 00:10:44,484
Yes, the thing is unfortunately, on the day of his birthday,

170
00:10:44,484 --> 00:10:46,584
Danjiro was attacked by a robber.

171
00:10:46,584 --> 00:10:48,084
Robber?

172
00:10:48,084 --> 00:10:50,184
Grandfather Choichiro and the others

173
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:52,684
gave in quietly and was tied up so they were fine,

174
00:10:52,684 --> 00:10:55,184
but Danjiro resisted

175
00:10:55,184 --> 00:10:57,384
so he passed away a few days later

176
00:10:57,384 --> 00:11:00,584
because of the blow he incurred during the robbery.

177
00:11:00,584 --> 00:11:02,484
Uncle Kyosuke who was left behind,

178
00:11:02,484 --> 00:11:04,584
was adopted by the family on his mother's side

179
00:11:04,584 --> 00:11:07,284
and took after the surname Haga.

180
00:11:07,284 --> 00:11:08,884
I see.

181
00:11:08,884 --> 00:11:12,184
But, it's a amazing that this wasn't stolen.

182
00:11:12,184 --> 00:11:16,484
I mean the robber was probably after the Stradivarius.

183
00:11:16,484 --> 00:11:18,784
The robber seems to have taken the wrong violin.

184
00:11:18,784 --> 00:11:21,384
Since the Shitara Family has been musicians for generations.

185
00:11:21,384 --> 00:11:24,184
There were many violins.

186
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,084
It all happened 30 years ago though.

187
00:11:28,284 --> 00:11:30,284
Don't tell me that you want me to find out

188
00:11:30,284 --> 00:11:33,084
who the robber that broke in here 30 years ago was?

189
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:35,284
No, what I'd like to ask you to do is...

190
00:11:35,284 --> 00:11:37,284
to solve the shuddering incidents,

191
00:11:37,284 --> 00:11:39,684
that have happened within the last two years.

192
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:45,984
The first one is the incident that happened the year before last.

193
00:11:45,984 --> 00:11:49,484
Uncle Genzaburo's wife who had been very athletic,

194
00:11:49,484 --> 00:11:52,784
tripped on the stairs and passed away.

195
00:11:52,784 --> 00:11:55,484
The other one is an incident that happened last year...

196
00:11:55,484 --> 00:11:59,584
My father, Furuto leaned against a corroded fence of the veranda.

197
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:01,484
It's unlikely that my father who was a very careful person

198
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:03,184
would fall to his death like that.

199
00:12:03,184 --> 00:12:05,684
I just can't make myself think that something like that could happen.

200
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,284
I would like you to solve these hideous cases, Detective Mouri.

201
00:12:10,484 --> 00:12:13,284
Maybe those two incidents were accidents...

202
00:12:13,284 --> 00:12:17,784
No! Both of them passed away on Grandfather's birthday!

203
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:19,184
Moreover, at this time,

204
00:12:19,184 --> 00:12:21,784
the two played this Stradivarius.

205
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:23,584
It is as if they were cursed by the incident

206
00:12:23,584 --> 00:12:25,584
that occurred 30 years ago.

207
00:12:25,584 --> 00:12:28,284
And, this year, I'm going to be playing it...

208
00:12:28,284 --> 00:12:30,984
I'm sure that something bad will happen to me too.

209
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,984
Then, don't play it.

210
00:12:33,984 --> 00:12:35,384
I want to play it!

211
00:12:36,584 --> 00:12:39,884
But, if you can take it out freely like this anytime,

212
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,984
you can play it any time you like, can't you?

213
00:12:41,984 --> 00:12:43,984
I can't take it out freely.

214
00:12:43,984 --> 00:12:47,784
I borrowed it from Grandfather just for today

215
00:12:47,784 --> 00:12:50,384
for this special occasion so I can practice.

216
00:12:50,384 --> 00:12:51,484
That's why...

217
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:59,084
See, I'm sure he's watching me.

218
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:00,884
Then, you mean the violin that I played

219
00:13:00,884 --> 00:13:02,784
a little a while ago wasn't supposed to be...

220
00:13:02,784 --> 00:13:04,484
Of course it's a secret.

221
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:08,384
And, what would you like me to do?

222
00:13:08,384 --> 00:13:10,684
I want you to undo the curse of this Stradivarius

223
00:13:10,684 --> 00:13:12,384
before I begin playing it.

224
00:13:13,884 --> 00:13:15,484
A curse is not something

225
00:13:15,484 --> 00:13:18,684
that a detective like me can solve, you see.

226
00:13:18,684 --> 00:13:23,084
What? I thought that detectives solve anything.

227
00:13:24,284 --> 00:13:26,184
It somehow seems to be bright outside.

228
00:13:26,184 --> 00:13:28,984
Are you going to have some birthday fireworks or something?

229
00:13:28,984 --> 00:13:31,284
No, there are no such plans...

230
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:38,284
The annex!

231
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,484
It's on fire!

232
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:55,193
Grand-Uncle Genzaburo is there.

233
00:13:56,693 --> 00:13:59,093
Fire! Open the curtains and look!

234
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:04,293
Where's your uncle's room?

235
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:07,093
It's on the 2nd floor right up the stairs.

236
00:14:08,993 --> 00:14:11,193
Hey, uncle, can you hear me?

237
00:14:11,193 --> 00:14:12,193
Hey!

238
00:14:12,193 --> 00:14:14,993
Darn. The door is locked.

239
00:14:14,993 --> 00:14:16,993
We've got no other choice.

240
00:14:26,693 --> 00:14:28,593
-Great Uncle! -Don't go inside!

241
00:14:28,593 --> 00:14:30,193
It is impossible to help him.

242
00:14:31,893 --> 00:14:34,193
Ayane. Ayane...

243
00:14:34,193 --> 00:14:35,293
Grandfather!

244
00:14:38,393 --> 00:14:41,493
Ayane is still upstairs.

245
00:14:41,493 --> 00:14:43,393
What? Grandmother is upstairs.

246
00:14:43,393 --> 00:14:45,093
Where is the room upstairs?

247
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,193
The room at the very end of the 3rd floor

248
00:14:52,193 --> 00:14:53,693
This is impossible, unless we have a fire-proof suit or something.

249
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:54,693
Oh no.

250
00:15:07,593 --> 00:15:09,793
I can't help myself for being the way I am.

251
00:15:09,793 --> 00:15:11,293
Take care of everyone else, will you?

252
00:15:12,393 --> 00:15:13,393
Uncle.

253
00:15:13,393 --> 00:15:17,793
Pops, please park your car below that window, quick!

254
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:18,793
Do that, okay?

255
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,093
Hey, you! Wait, it's dangerous.

256
00:15:30,793 --> 00:15:32,193
Are you all right?

257
00:15:32,193 --> 00:15:34,193
Grandfather, please get a hold of yourself.

258
00:15:40,693 --> 00:15:43,193
Hey, Dad, wait, just what do you think you're doing?

259
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:44,393
Beats me!

260
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:52,093
That kid told me to park my car here.

261
00:15:52,093 --> 00:15:54,593
How come I'm listening to that kid?

262
00:16:27,193 --> 00:16:28,193
What?

263
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,593
Hey, get a hold of yourself, Aunty!

264
00:16:35,593 --> 00:16:36,593
Mrs. Shitara!

265
00:16:40,393 --> 00:16:43,793
I see, he wanted to reduce the distance of the fall with the car

266
00:16:43,793 --> 00:16:45,393
and used the roof as cushion.

267
00:16:45,393 --> 00:16:47,593
Just what a kid would think of.

268
00:16:47,593 --> 00:16:48,993
We were lucky that we got a wagon

269
00:16:48,993 --> 00:16:51,493
because they had nothing else.

270
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:53,393
It's a rental car, you know!

271
00:16:53,393 --> 00:16:56,293
Who knows how much we're going to have to pay for repair.

272
00:16:57,493 --> 00:17:00,293
The fire engines soon arrived at the scene but...

273
00:17:00,293 --> 00:17:04,193
the annex of the Shitara family kept on burning for a while.

274
00:17:04,193 --> 00:17:09,693
As if it were grieving the postlude of the conductor Genzaburo Shitara.

275
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:18,993
No!

276
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:22,293
But, we've got to treat you at the hospital either way.

277
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:23,993
No, no!

278
00:17:23,993 --> 00:17:27,893
I'm sorry, but could you let her have her way, please.

279
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:31,693
A year ago, our son was taken away on the ambulance

280
00:17:31,693 --> 00:17:34,493
and never came back.

281
00:17:34,493 --> 00:17:37,393
I guess she doesn't want to ride the same vehicle.

282
00:17:37,393 --> 00:17:42,093
Could you please treat her at home just for today?

283
00:17:45,793 --> 00:17:48,193
Thank you, sonny.

284
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,093
I'm sorry for what you had to go through too, Kyosuke.

285
00:17:50,093 --> 00:17:51,493
Thank you.

286
00:17:51,493 --> 00:17:52,593
No problem.

287
00:17:54,393 --> 00:17:56,793
Little Kyosuke, are you all right?

288
00:17:56,793 --> 00:17:58,093
I'm fine.

289
00:17:58,093 --> 00:18:01,193
Will you please cut out that "Little" when calling me?

290
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:03,593
30 years have gone by all ready.

291
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:08,693
The steward, Ms. Tsumagari

292
00:18:08,693 --> 00:18:12,593
was originally working at Uncle Kyosuke's house.

293
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:15,793
But, 30 years ago after that robbery,

294
00:18:15,793 --> 00:18:17,793
when Danjiro and his wife passed away,

295
00:18:17,793 --> 00:18:19,493
and Uncle Kyosuke who was left behind

296
00:18:19,493 --> 00:18:21,493
took after the Haga family name,

297
00:18:21,493 --> 00:18:23,393
we had Ms. Tsumagari come to work for us,

298
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,193
and she's been with us since.

299
00:18:25,193 --> 00:18:28,793
Kyosuke's father was not the only one who passed away?

300
00:18:28,793 --> 00:18:29,893
No.

301
00:18:29,893 --> 00:18:34,293
His mother Chiha, was not a very healthy person to begin with,

302
00:18:34,293 --> 00:18:37,293
but she watched over her husband Danjiro without sleeping...

303
00:18:37,293 --> 00:18:40,993
As a result, she fell ill of extreme fatigue and...

304
00:18:40,993 --> 00:18:44,093
And, what about your mother, Hasuki?

305
00:18:44,093 --> 00:18:46,393
She got a divorce and went back to her parental home,

306
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:49,793
just before Grandfather's birthday 2 years ago.

307
00:18:49,793 --> 00:18:54,693
That's why Great Aunty Eimi ended up playing for his birthday,

308
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:56,993
since it was Grandfather's 70th birthday

309
00:18:56,993 --> 00:18:59,293
as well as to encourage Father.

310
00:18:59,293 --> 00:19:03,293
She was to play that Stradivarius that had been sealed for 30 years.

311
00:19:03,293 --> 00:19:05,193
That famed musical instrument was sealed?

312
00:19:05,193 --> 00:19:08,393
Yes. When Grandfather received it from Danjiro,

313
00:19:08,393 --> 00:19:10,993
he was very happy but...

314
00:19:12,493 --> 00:19:15,893
My father who borrowed it when he was 18 years old,

315
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:17,193
and performed in a contest

316
00:19:17,193 --> 00:19:19,193
experienced the strings snapping apart twice on stage,

317
00:19:19,193 --> 00:19:21,093
and was disqualified.

318
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,293
Yet, on another occasion,

319
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:25,993
my aunt who was scheduled to perform on a certain TV program,

320
00:19:25,993 --> 00:19:29,893
came down with a high fever right before show time.

321
00:19:29,893 --> 00:19:32,893
And, Great Uncle Genzaburo, who was on his way to a concert abroad,

322
00:19:32,893 --> 00:19:35,793
came down with a serious case of tenosynovitis during practice.

323
00:19:35,793 --> 00:19:39,593
I see. I can see why you'd want to seal it.

324
00:19:39,593 --> 00:19:42,993
You think the violin's okay?

325
00:19:42,993 --> 00:19:45,593
It was left on the desk in the room as is.

326
00:19:47,393 --> 00:19:49,393
If this fire was a case of arson,

327
00:19:49,393 --> 00:19:51,293
it could've been taken during all this commotion.

328
00:19:51,293 --> 00:19:52,893
No, it wasn't.

329
00:19:52,893 --> 00:19:56,193
I put it back in the storage room right away.

330
00:19:56,193 --> 00:19:58,893
Or, do I look like an incompetent steward

331
00:19:58,893 --> 00:20:02,593
who would leave such a famed musical instrument unattended in a household

332
00:20:02,593 --> 00:20:04,493
where outsiders are walking around?

333
00:20:05,493 --> 00:20:06,493
Oh, well... No.

334
00:20:06,493 --> 00:20:08,793
Besides, the fire was not caused by arson,

335
00:20:08,793 --> 00:20:09,993
but rather, smoking while sleeping.

336
00:20:10,993 --> 00:20:12,193
It seems that the area around the ashtray

337
00:20:12,193 --> 00:20:14,593
that was in that room is where the fire started,

338
00:20:14,593 --> 00:20:17,093
and the door was torn off with the key locked.

339
00:20:17,093 --> 00:20:19,393
You're the one who broke it down, right?

340
00:20:19,393 --> 00:20:21,593
If so, the room was locked

341
00:20:21,593 --> 00:20:23,193
and arson would be impossible.

342
00:20:23,193 --> 00:20:24,893
Oh, is that right.

343
00:20:24,893 --> 00:20:28,593
Well, please be extremely careful when smoking.

344
00:20:28,593 --> 00:20:31,493
It's best not to smoke though.

345
00:20:31,493 --> 00:20:33,593
Yeah, that's right.

346
00:20:34,893 --> 00:20:37,693
But, even if everything were to be a coincidence,

347
00:20:37,693 --> 00:20:39,193
it sure is frightening.

348
00:20:39,193 --> 00:20:40,393
To think that something would happen

349
00:20:40,393 --> 00:20:41,793
on the same day for three consecutive years.

350
00:20:41,793 --> 00:20:43,193
Yes.

351
00:20:43,193 --> 00:20:49,393
Including Kyosuke's father who died in the robbery 30 years ago,

352
00:20:49,393 --> 00:20:51,493
it comes up to a total of four all together.

353
00:20:51,493 --> 00:20:52,693
Taking this into consideration,

354
00:20:52,693 --> 00:20:58,293
I think you should stop celebrating Choichiro's birthday from next year.

355
00:20:58,293 --> 00:21:00,993
I tell you, he's already smoking.

356
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,693
Well, it'll turn out that way anyway,

357
00:21:03,693 --> 00:21:05,493
because Uncle has bad lungs

358
00:21:05,493 --> 00:21:08,593
and has only a half a year to live.

359
00:21:08,593 --> 00:21:10,093
Really?

360
00:21:10,093 --> 00:21:14,393
Yes. I wanted to at least celebrate today with him.

361
00:21:14,393 --> 00:21:16,193
We can't anymore,

362
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:18,993
because he's already gone to bed.

363
00:21:18,993 --> 00:21:22,393
The Mrs. has already been treated and has also gone to bed.

364
00:21:22,393 --> 00:21:26,093
So, since this doesn't seem to be a case or anything,

365
00:21:26,093 --> 00:21:28,093
we'll start off home too.

366
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:37,293
Who's cigarette butt is this?

367
00:21:37,293 --> 00:21:40,193
It doesn't seem to be yours, Pops.

368
00:21:40,193 --> 00:21:42,293
That brand is the one...

369
00:21:42,293 --> 00:21:44,693
that Great Uncle Genzaburo used to smoke.

370
00:21:44,693 --> 00:21:46,093
Come to think of it,

371
00:21:46,093 --> 00:21:49,493
he stopped by here before going to the annex.

372
00:21:49,493 --> 00:21:51,293
If so, then...

373
00:21:51,293 --> 00:21:52,593
this is...

374
00:21:56,493 --> 00:21:57,593
Conan?

375
00:22:00,793 --> 00:22:03,193
Kid, where do you think you're going?

376
00:22:18,793 --> 00:22:20,493
Just as I thought.

377
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:27,593
This is not an accident, but murder.

378
00:22:27,593 --> 00:22:30,693
Moreover, if my deduction is correct,

379
00:22:30,693 --> 00:22:32,693
the next target is...

380
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,420
Next Conan's Hint:

381
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,420
"Initial"

382
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,820
-Conan, I'm sure the murderer is the mother. -Why do you say that?

383
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,024
I'm certain it's mother and child.
