1
00:00:03,082 --> 00:00:04,882
The light of summer is the glory of yesterday.

2
00:00:04,882 --> 00:00:06,682
After the tears is "The Company".

3
00:00:06,682 --> 00:00:08,282
After the deduction, the culprit is finally found!

4
00:00:08,282 --> 00:00:09,782
The black picture that connects to the Organization.

5
00:00:09,782 --> 00:00:11,382
An unexpected person is there?

6
00:00:11,382 --> 00:00:12,782
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,782 --> 00:00:14,282
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,282 --> 00:00:16,182
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:57,112 --> 00:01:58,312
After getting information about

10
00:01:58,312 --> 00:02:01,312
a clue to the past of the mysterious new student

11
00:02:01,312 --> 00:02:03,812
called Eisuke Hondo from Heiji,

12
00:02:03,812 --> 00:02:07,712
we visited the home of a plastic model shop owner

13
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:10,112
who said that he had the picture of Eisuke's father.

14
00:02:11,512 --> 00:02:14,612
However, the picture we went to see was gone!

15
00:02:16,712 --> 00:02:18,512
From the traces left in the room,

16
00:02:18,512 --> 00:02:21,712
I deduced that it was the work of an intruder.

17
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:23,212
Well, by the way,

18
00:02:23,212 --> 00:02:26,412
does anybody have the spare key to this room?

19
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:29,312
"Souhei Nishizato (32)" -Well, there are.

20
00:02:29,312 --> 00:02:30,512
"Shopkeeper of a model shop" -Three people do.

21
00:02:30,512 --> 00:02:32,412
Will you please call them

22
00:02:32,412 --> 00:02:34,512
and ask them what they were doing today anyway?

23
00:02:34,512 --> 00:02:36,212
Okay.

24
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:38,712
-Hey. -Conan.

25
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:44,212
How come you're not calling the police right away?

26
00:02:44,212 --> 00:02:47,412
Don't tell me the one who broke in here is...

27
00:02:47,412 --> 00:02:50,012
Not a member of the Black Organization.

28
00:02:50,012 --> 00:02:52,412
There are too many clues left behind to have been carried out by them.

29
00:02:52,412 --> 00:02:55,412
Then, why aren't you calling the police right away?

30
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:58,612
If the police come and start interrogation,

31
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,912
they'll find out immediately that

32
00:03:00,912 --> 00:03:02,512
we're not his grandfather's acquaintance!

33
00:03:02,512 --> 00:03:04,212
So, before that,

34
00:03:04,212 --> 00:03:07,112
I'm trying to make him aware of the situation as soon as possible

35
00:03:07,112 --> 00:03:09,912
and catch the one who snuck into this room.

36
00:03:09,912 --> 00:03:13,212
I've got to get it back.

37
00:03:13,212 --> 00:03:18,312
The picture of Eisuke Hondo's father that was taken!

38
00:03:20,012 --> 00:03:25,912
"Whereabouts of the Black Picture (Part 2)"

39
00:03:27,212 --> 00:03:28,712
Saori?

40
00:03:28,712 --> 00:03:32,012
No, it's no big deal.

41
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,512
I was just wondering how you were doing.

42
00:03:34,512 --> 00:03:37,312
What were you doing today?

43
00:03:37,312 --> 00:03:38,612
What do I have to tell you,

44
00:03:38,612 --> 00:03:40,712
who I don't go with anymore something like that?

45
00:03:40,712 --> 00:03:42,712
I guess you're right.

46
00:03:42,712 --> 00:03:46,112
Nothing really. I just went shopping for some clothes!

47
00:03:46,112 --> 00:03:48,612
I'm going on a date with my new boyfriend from now.

48
00:03:48,612 --> 00:03:51,312
I see. I'm happy for you.

49
00:03:51,312 --> 00:03:54,312
Yes! We're going to go eat at an Italian restaurant in Beika Hotel!

50
00:03:54,312 --> 00:03:57,212
I advise you to eat good food sometimes too, Souhei!

51
00:03:57,212 --> 00:03:59,312
You're always eating cup noodles, right?

52
00:03:59,312 --> 00:04:00,512
Yeah.

53
00:04:00,512 --> 00:04:04,212
Make sure you take a bath! Understand?

54
00:04:04,212 --> 00:04:05,612
Yeah.

55
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,612
Bye, then because he'll be coming here soon.

56
00:04:08,612 --> 00:04:10,812
Don't call me anymore, okay?

57
00:04:10,812 --> 00:04:12,512
Sorry.

58
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:20,512
Do I really have to do something like this?

59
00:04:23,712 --> 00:04:26,412
Just in case.

60
00:04:26,412 --> 00:04:29,112
Huh? What was I doing all day today?

61
00:04:29,112 --> 00:04:30,312
Yeah.

62
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,312
I was confined to my room working on the war tank.

63
00:04:32,312 --> 00:04:35,412
I was making the war tank! Tiger 1!

64
00:04:35,412 --> 00:04:37,012
The contest is coming up too!

65
00:04:37,012 --> 00:04:38,412
I see.

66
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:40,912
And? Is going well, Tago?

67
00:04:40,912 --> 00:04:42,512
Yeah, just great!

68
00:04:42,512 --> 00:04:44,512
Even the rust looks good!

69
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:46,312
Oh, I'll be looking forward to seeing it!

70
00:04:46,312 --> 00:04:49,212
You've really become skillful recently too.

71
00:04:49,212 --> 00:04:50,612
Oh, that's right.

72
00:04:50,612 --> 00:04:53,812
Make sure you finish your soldier by tomorrow!

73
00:04:53,812 --> 00:04:57,412
I want to make sure that it fits my tank.

74
00:04:57,412 --> 00:04:59,612
-Tomorrow? -Yeah.

75
00:04:59,612 --> 00:05:02,512
It would help a lot if you can also have it painted by then.

76
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:05,212
I'm going to start getting busy from day after tomorrow, you see.

77
00:05:05,212 --> 00:05:06,712
No joke.

78
00:05:06,712 --> 00:05:08,812
That means I've got to stay up all night.

79
00:05:08,812 --> 00:05:12,512
I've got a load of dishes and laundry to do.

80
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,512
Do those things after you get up!

81
00:05:14,512 --> 00:05:17,312
It's already late, and you'd be troubling you neighbors anyway!

82
00:05:19,012 --> 00:05:20,912
If you like, I can go over to your place in the morning

83
00:05:20,912 --> 00:05:24,212
and do your dishes and laundry while you're asleep, you know.

84
00:05:24,212 --> 00:05:27,012
Thanks, that'd be a lot of help.

85
00:05:28,212 --> 00:05:29,912
Oh, seems like someone's come.

86
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,712
See you tomorrow, then.

87
00:05:34,012 --> 00:05:35,612
Delivery.

88
00:05:35,612 --> 00:05:37,612
Okay, I'll be right there!

89
00:05:40,812 --> 00:05:45,012
You were sick in bed all day with a cold?

90
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,512
Hey, are you all right or what, Furusho?

91
00:05:47,512 --> 00:05:49,712
Yes, sort of.

92
00:05:49,712 --> 00:05:53,112
It seems I've got a bad viral illness.

93
00:05:53,112 --> 00:05:57,012
I advise you to clean your room up too, Mr. Nishizato.

94
00:05:57,012 --> 00:05:58,312
Yeah.

95
00:05:58,312 --> 00:06:02,612
Your room is just as bad as mine when it comes to being messy.

96
00:06:05,912 --> 00:06:07,212
Yeah.

97
00:06:07,212 --> 00:06:08,812
Talking about virus,

98
00:06:08,812 --> 00:06:13,012
please make sure you upgrade your anti-virus software!

99
00:06:13,012 --> 00:06:16,612
Yeah. A bad virus seems to be going around lately, I hear.

100
00:06:16,612 --> 00:06:20,012
Yes. So if the pictures of the georama

101
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:23,512
that we made that you have on your blog is deleted by someone,

102
00:06:23,512 --> 00:06:25,012
I'm going to cry.

103
00:06:25,012 --> 00:06:27,112
But we can take the pictures over again anytime if we want.

104
00:06:27,112 --> 00:06:29,212
Georamas are alive!

105
00:06:29,212 --> 00:06:32,512
The feel and looks of the georamas change depending on the day!

106
00:06:33,812 --> 00:06:35,012
Okay! Okay! I got it!

107
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:38,312
I'm always grateful for your skills in taking pictures.

108
00:06:38,312 --> 00:06:40,812
Rest well and get well soon, okay!

109
00:06:40,812 --> 00:06:44,812
Yeah, I got it. I'll upgrade the software,

110
00:06:44,812 --> 00:06:47,812
-so don't worry. -It's wet.

111
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:49,112
Is this sweat?

112
00:06:50,412 --> 00:06:54,212
Do you remember the number of the pairs of slippers you have?

113
00:06:54,212 --> 00:06:56,612
No. Because when the georama is completed,

114
00:06:56,612 --> 00:06:58,112
I call a lot of my friends over

115
00:06:58,112 --> 00:07:01,012
and we talk about what we made while drinking.

116
00:07:01,012 --> 00:07:03,612
I think I bought a lot of pairs though.

117
00:07:03,612 --> 00:07:05,812
But I really don't know how many.

118
00:07:17,212 --> 00:07:19,912
There aren't any damp slippers.

119
00:07:19,912 --> 00:07:23,012
And? Are there any suspicious ones among the three?

120
00:07:23,012 --> 00:07:24,312
Not at all.

121
00:07:24,312 --> 00:07:26,712
They all seemed to be their normal selves.

122
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:29,612
Well, I guess we can call the police and leave the rest to them.

123
00:07:29,612 --> 00:07:32,812
What kind of people are the three?

124
00:07:32,812 --> 00:07:34,312
What kind of people...

125
00:07:34,312 --> 00:07:36,112
I just told you a while ago, didn't I?

126
00:07:36,112 --> 00:07:40,712
See, like are they fat, skinny, tall...

127
00:07:40,712 --> 00:07:45,312
Saori, the first one I talked to is about 150 cm.

128
00:07:45,312 --> 00:07:47,612
And a bit plump.

129
00:07:47,612 --> 00:07:49,912
How rude!

130
00:07:49,912 --> 00:07:53,112
Tago, the next one I called is quite small.

131
00:07:53,112 --> 00:07:55,312
He's shorter than my ex-girlfriend.

132
00:07:55,312 --> 00:07:58,412
The last one I called, Furusho is tall and thin

133
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:01,412
and is a little over 180 cm tall I think...

134
00:08:01,412 --> 00:08:04,012
But who cares about things like that now?

135
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:07,012
Well... Now, I'm sure.

136
00:08:09,412 --> 00:08:11,112
That the person who came in here

137
00:08:11,112 --> 00:08:15,112
and took the picture is among the three.

138
00:08:15,112 --> 00:08:17,512
-What? -What's more surprising is

139
00:08:17,512 --> 00:08:24,312
that person is still right here with us hiding!

140
00:08:24,312 --> 00:08:26,412
Hey, what do you mean right here with us?

141
00:08:26,412 --> 00:08:30,012
Don't tell me together in this room with us?

142
00:08:30,012 --> 00:08:31,912
Very interesting, kid.

143
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:33,312
If you insist that the culprit

144
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:36,212
is my ex-girlfriend Saori who has the spare key to this room

145
00:08:36,212 --> 00:08:39,312
or my plastic model making friends Tago or Furusho

146
00:08:39,312 --> 00:08:43,212
and they are here hiding in this room some place...

147
00:08:43,212 --> 00:08:47,312
-drag the one out here right this minute. -Yeah, okay!

148
00:08:47,312 --> 00:08:51,312
But, will you promise me something?

149
00:08:51,312 --> 00:08:53,412
What is it? Tell me.

150
00:08:53,412 --> 00:08:57,112
If the culprit comes out, before calling the police,

151
00:08:57,112 --> 00:09:00,912
will you show us the picture that the culprit is still holding, to us first?

152
00:09:02,412 --> 00:09:04,512
If the police come here,

153
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:08,512
they'll most surely confiscate the album as evidence, right?

154
00:09:08,512 --> 00:09:12,112
Then, I won't be able to see the picture for quite some time again!

155
00:09:13,412 --> 00:09:14,812
Yeah.

156
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:18,512
The picture of the guy who forgot his wallet at grandpa's Okonomiya shop

157
00:09:18,512 --> 00:09:20,412
is what you're referring to, right?

158
00:09:22,612 --> 00:09:27,412
Yeah. I think that he really needs the wallet back,

159
00:09:27,412 --> 00:09:29,612
so I'd like to return it to him as soon as possible!

160
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:34,212
But, how do you know that

161
00:09:34,212 --> 00:09:37,112
the one who stole the pictures is still in this room?

162
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,012
Sweat.

163
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:43,312
-Sweat. -Sweat?

164
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:47,312
The chair that I used as a foot stool was damp with sweat.

165
00:09:47,312 --> 00:09:49,312
In other words, the culprit like me,

166
00:09:49,312 --> 00:09:51,212
used that chair as a foot stool

167
00:09:51,212 --> 00:09:55,212
and the chair got damp from the sweat on the sole of his feet, right?

168
00:09:55,212 --> 00:09:58,712
But just because the sweat isn't dried yet,

169
00:09:58,712 --> 00:10:00,712
that doesn't mean that the culprit is still hiding in this room, does it?

170
00:10:00,712 --> 00:10:02,012
It's not here!

171
00:10:02,012 --> 00:10:04,412
What's not here?

172
00:10:04,412 --> 00:10:06,812
The slipper that the culprit

173
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:10,612
should've been wearing that is damp with sweat.

174
00:10:10,612 --> 00:10:12,612
It's nowhere in sight.

175
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,312
See, since there are no footprints left on the floor,

176
00:10:16,312 --> 00:10:18,612
it means that the culprit was wearing slippers, right?

177
00:10:18,612 --> 00:10:21,312
Maybe the culprit wiped them off?

178
00:10:21,312 --> 00:10:23,412
He broke in to the room after all!

179
00:10:23,412 --> 00:10:26,512
If so, the culprit would've wiped the sweat that is on the floor too!

180
00:10:26,512 --> 00:10:31,512
But, all you checked were the slippers at the entrance, right?

181
00:10:31,512 --> 00:10:35,012
You didn't check the one that I'm wearing now, did you?

182
00:10:35,012 --> 00:10:39,812
These could've been the slippers the culprit was wearing, you know.

183
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:42,312
My socks are quite thick,

184
00:10:42,312 --> 00:10:44,212
so I wouldn't be able to tell even if the slippers were damp.

185
00:10:44,212 --> 00:10:47,712
No, I think that even a super dense person would realize.

186
00:10:47,712 --> 00:10:50,312
Because not only would the slipper be damp,

187
00:10:50,312 --> 00:10:52,312
it would be warm too.

188
00:10:52,312 --> 00:10:56,112
So, you'd know immediately that someone was here till a while ago!

189
00:10:56,112 --> 00:10:57,612
When we came into this room,

190
00:10:57,612 --> 00:11:00,112
nobody mentioned anything like that, which means...

191
00:11:00,112 --> 00:11:03,012
the person who knew you were coming back to this room

192
00:11:03,012 --> 00:11:06,712
still wearing those slippers rushed to hide some place.

193
00:11:06,712 --> 00:11:08,012
True...

194
00:11:08,012 --> 00:11:12,312
But, the culprit was rummaging through the room for the pictures, right?

195
00:11:12,312 --> 00:11:15,412
How did the culprit know that he came back?

196
00:11:15,412 --> 00:11:17,812
Oh, that's...

197
00:11:17,812 --> 00:11:19,812
Look over there!

198
00:11:23,912 --> 00:11:27,112
-The interphone? -Yeah.

199
00:11:27,112 --> 00:11:28,812
When we came into the room a while ago,

200
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:32,512
I pushed the button of the interphone, didn't I?

201
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:41,312
And right after that, you followed us from behind.

202
00:11:41,312 --> 00:11:45,412
That's why the culprit could also tell that you came home too!

203
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:48,212
Because the interphone tells you who's at the door right away

204
00:11:48,212 --> 00:11:51,612
since everything is displayed on the screen.

205
00:11:55,612 --> 00:11:59,512
Just like when the courier came a while ago!

206
00:11:59,512 --> 00:12:01,612
Come to think of it, that's true.

207
00:12:01,612 --> 00:12:02,712
I see.

208
00:12:02,712 --> 00:12:07,312
With all of us coming up here to the room and ringing the doorbell,

209
00:12:07,312 --> 00:12:09,612
the culprit would've had enough time to hide

210
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:11,312
while we open the front door.

211
00:12:11,312 --> 00:12:12,612
That's right!

212
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:15,212
And? Who on earth is that culprit?

213
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:17,912
If you recall what the people were saying

214
00:12:17,912 --> 00:12:20,212
when Mr. Nishizato phone them,

215
00:12:20,212 --> 00:12:22,512
I think anyone can figure it out!

216
00:12:23,512 --> 00:12:27,512
Because that culprit confessed where he was hiding...

217
00:12:30,212 --> 00:12:33,112
on the phone.

218
00:12:33,112 --> 00:12:34,912
No joke?

219
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,800
And? What were the three saying on the phone?

220
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,100
Yeah. I think it was...

221
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,400
Saori was like usual, was giving pieces of her mind.

222
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,300
Like eat right and take a bath.

223
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,100
Tago said he wanted me to finish my plastic model by tomorrow.

224
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,400
And, also to do my laundry and dishes

225
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,900
after I get up in the morning.

226
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,600
Furusho said for me to clean my room

227
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,200
so that I wouldn't catch a cold like him,

228
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,700
and advised me to upgrade the anti-virus software in my computer.

229
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,000
Which means that Mr. Furusho can be crossed off.

230
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,800
If you decide to clean your room,

231
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,200
you'd find him in there hiding.

232
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,300
Yeah, that's right!

233
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,800
Then, could it be Saori?

234
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,000
She told you to eat right and take a bath, right?

235
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,100
If you go out to eat or take a bath,

236
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,600
it would make it easy for her to get out of here.

237
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,400
That's suspicious.

238
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,000
Saori said I shouldn't call again because her boyfriend was coming.

239
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,800
I don't think it's Saori!

240
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,400
-What? -Because when you called her,

241
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,900
we couldn't hear her voice, right?

242
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,900
That means that the culprit is hiding in a place

243
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,400
where our voices or the noise we make can't be heard.

244
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,800
From a place like that,

245
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,100
I think the culprit would not be able to tell

246
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,000
if you leave this room or go to take a bath!

247
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,100
Besides, you said that

248
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,800
you usually leave the light on even when you go out.

249
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
In other words, the only teeny bit of information

250
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,100
that the culprit is able to get

251
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,600
if any is the time displayed on his cell phone.

252
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,300
Yeah, at this point.

253
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,900
Hey, wait a sec.

254
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,400
If the culprit's not Saori or Furusho, then...

255
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:27,300
The culprit is the one who asked you to finish the model by tomorrow

256
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,600
and moreover, told you to do the dishes and the laundry

257
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,200
after you get up in the morning.

258
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,400
I think it's Mr. Tago!

259
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,100
No way! Telling me to finish it by tomorrow

260
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,200
means he expects me to stay up all night, doesn't it?

261
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,800
If I'm up all night, he can't run away!

262
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,900
In order to flee, he had to take the risk of making you do so!

263
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,100
What things do you have to do

264
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,200
before preparing to make plastic models?

265
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,000
What things?

266
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,800
First, I have to get tools like the rasp,

267
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,100
the putty, paint, and etc out...

268
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,600
What, after you get all the tools ready?

269
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,800
Let's see...

270
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,000
I'll open the window to air the place out.

271
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,700
Don't tell me that...

272
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,600
you think that Tago is out on the balcony?

273
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,800
That's just it!

274
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,400
He had to have you open the window

275
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,800
in order to flee from the balcony.

276
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,400
Because just a while ago, after you and I went out on the balcony...

277
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,200
We locked the window!

278
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,300
I see!

279
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,900
He mentioned that you always keep the window open.

280
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,300
He figured that once Mr. Nishizato finishes making the plastic model,

281
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,400
he would open the window and go to sleep.

282
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,500
Yeah. So as long as he opens the window,

283
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,700
the culprit can also sneak a peek inside the room too!

284
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,800
But, when we came out here a while ago, there was nobody there!

285
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,500
Yep! Not anywhere in view.

286
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,900
Not anywhere in view?

287
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,300
You know now why the person told you

288
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,900
to do the dishes and laundry after you get up in the morning, right?

289
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,300
Hey, then don't tell me that he...

290
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,200
Right, the reason he said so

291
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,700
was of course to keep you from opening the lid of the washing machine!

292
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,700
Tago? You...

293
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,800
Oh, well, you see...

294
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,000
By the way, he said that

295
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,400
he'd do the dishes for you when he comes by tomorrow

296
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,500
because he was going to come into the room

297
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,900
from the balcony after you fell asleep,

298
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,800
and if by chance, you got up and caught him

299
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,700
before he goes out of the front door,

300
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,200
he could use it as an excuse and say, "I came early to do the dishes

301
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,500
but didn't want to wake you."

302
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,200
By saying something like this,

303
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,400
he could tiptoe around and act suspicious,

304
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,400
yet would be able to convince you of what he was doing.

305
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:56,600
Yeah. Of course what you told me of his height and physique

306
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
helped me reach my conclusion!

307
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,700
He probably used that chair as a footstool

308
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,500
in order to take the album that was on top of the bookshelf,

309
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,800
because he was short

310
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,500
and also built quite small.

311
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,500
Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to hide in the washing machine!

312
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,800
I'm sorry, Souhei! I didn't mean malice at all!

313
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,400
I didn't touch anything else in the room

314
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,600
except for the room where the album was,

315
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,200
so please forgive me!

316
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,900
So, are you the one who deleted the data of the picture

317
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,400
-that was in the computer? -Yeah.

318
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,800
But don't worry! I took a back up of it.

319
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,400
After I deleted the picture in question,

320
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,300
I was going to secretly put it back where it originally was.

321
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,900
Same with the picture in the album.

322
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,600
That was all I was going to take out.

323
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,900
And! Just which picture is it?

324
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,900
I don't have any picture of yours that you wouldn't want me to have!

325
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
The model...

326
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,500
The one I showed you last time...

327
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,100
The German military number 4 war tank model H.

328
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,700
Huh? That war tank was pretty good.

329
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,500
The other model making members were praising it too,

330
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,500
saying that maybe you've started to get the hang of it.

331
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,600
That's not it.

332
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,300
I didn't make that tank.

333
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,800
It's something that I bought

334
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,300
when I went on a business trip abroad.

335
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,200
I actually bought it to use it as an example to make my own.

336
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,100
I just thought I'd surprise all of you

337
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,300
so I switched the name plate on it with mine and showed it to you guys.

338
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,000
But you guys believed that I made it

339
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,100
and started taking pictures of it.

340
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,300
On top of that, you started saying

341
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,300
that you would introduce it on your blog.

342
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,100
That's why I came here to retrieve the picture

343
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,400
before you upload it on the internet.

344
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,400
You usually go to the gym today, but you came back

345
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,700
so I ended up hiding in the washing machine.

346
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,200
Stupid!

347
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,800
I kept my mouth shut and played along with your lies,

348
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,800
-but you had to get all serious about it. -Huh?

349
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:52,200
I knew to begin with that you didn't make that tank!

350
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,900
We all decided to say nothing

351
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:58,100
and play along with you until you regained your confidence!

352
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,600
You were all just playing along with me...

353
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,200
How rude!

354
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,200
You're the one who's rude

355
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,000
because you're the one who tried to deceive us first!

356
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Will you...

357
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,800
please show us the picture we came for?

358
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,400
And you won't be calling the police, will you?

359
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,800
Yeah.

360
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,600
You help look for the picture too!

361
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,100
Picture... What picture?

362
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,600
The picture of my grandfather

363
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,200
taken together with a customer that used to patronize the shop!

364
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,200
The man that often used to bring his son along!

365
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,900
-Do you know him too, Mr. Tago? -Yeah.

366
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,200
He used to go to the same university in Osaka as I did.

367
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,300
He used to take me a lot to the Okonomiyaki shop

368
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,200
that his grandfather used to run.

369
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,300
I was introduced to him there!

370
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,200
His grandfather said, that man was his number one customer!

371
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,500
If I remember correctly, that man used to scuba dive.

372
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,900
Huh? Didn't you say he was in the maritime-self-defense force?

373
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,600
Did he tell you that?

374
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Oh, no. When I was about to pay the tab,

375
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,500
I dropped some loose coins.

376
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,800
The coins just happened to roll near his table,

377
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,600
and heard a bit of the conversation when I went to pick the coins up.

378
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,700
He said, "We're finally going to take the dive."

379
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,500
Take the dive?

380
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,200
I was absorbed in making tanks and warships since I was a child,

381
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,900
so back then, I thought he was talking about submarines.

382
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,500
So, I asked Souhei's grandfather about it, and he told me that

383
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,000
the man was just an employee working in an ordinary company.

384
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
So, that's when I thought

385
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,900
he's scuba diving with his colleagues or something.

386
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,200
-With his colleagues? -Yeah!

387
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,600
Back then, three or four men

388
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,600
dressed in black were with him

389
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,800
who looked to be foreigners were with him!

390
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,400
But it sure sounded like they were going

391
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,600
to challenge a very dangerous sea

392
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,500
because he was telling everybody

393
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,700
things like, "Good luck. No pain, no gain".

394
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,000
Good luck...

395
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,600
No pain, no gain...

396
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,000
At that time, was his son with him too?

397
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,600
No, he wasn't.

398
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,900
When he brought his son with him, it was only him and his son.

399
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,300
Isn't this the one?

400
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,100
Yeah, right, it's this picture!

401
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,000
This boy probably pushed the shutter of your camera

402
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,800
when he was looking through the view finder!

403
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
Yeah, I didn't know

404
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,500
until I had this picture developed either.

405
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,900
Was he really an ordinary businessman?

406
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,000
Yeah, at least grandfather said so.

407
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,500
That this man was a businessman

408
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,800
who was hired by the company!

409
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,600
So, do you know what company that is?

410
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,200
No, I have no idea.

411
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,900
Company?

412
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,400
I'm happy for you, Shinichi.

413
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,300
Shinichi! Shinichi?

414
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,100
Doc! No use.

415
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,300
He's been staring at that picture from a while ago

416
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,500
and I don't think he can hear you at all, Doc.

417
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,300
Shinichi is in a world of his own.

418
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,400
Company...

419
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,400
Next Conan's Hint:

420
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,200
"The face of the clock"

421
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,500
Doc, do you have a watch?

422
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,100
Well, my stomach watch is growling.

423
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,900
It's almost 20:00.
