1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,890
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,090
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,790
Today's stage takes place in a wine cellar.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,890
Aged wine is the key to the crime.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,590
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,590
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,590
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:03,600
"The Locked Wine Cellar"

9
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,950
What a wonderful collection you have indeed!

10
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,350
How pleasing to the eye!

11
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,150
So, you're quite knowledgeable about wine, Mr. Mouri.

12
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,750
Oh, well...

13
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,550
"Shohei Kusaka (52)" -Just as expected of a renowned detective,

14
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,150
to know of this collection.

15
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,250
Oh, no. It's nothing like that.

16
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,850
This collection of labels

17
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,150
is one that a noble family of Europe had collected

18
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,350
over a long period of years.

19
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,950
Mr. Mouri seems to have done it.

20
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,450
I guess we won't be having wine for a while then.

21
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,650
Huh? Won't be having wine for a while?

22
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,450
Your father...

23
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,550
"Takeo Nonaka (42)" -just complimented the collection, right?

24
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,750
Then what happens is...

25
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,750
As if a switch is turned on,

26
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,850
he won't stop bragging about the collection.

27
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,450
"Jokichi Tonomura (40)" -Mr. Mouri is going to be stuck there

28
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,050
for a while.

29
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,950
In other words, he's a wine freak.

30
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,550
"Yukari Takano (38)" -Well, all he does

31
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,450
is repeat the same dialog over and over.

32
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,350
He'll say something like, "This is the gem of the whole collection

33
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,450
that is very hard to get a hold of."

34
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,650
This is Moselle wine,

35
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,950
a superb article that is very hard to get a hold of.

36
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,550
Most people get fed up with his boasting

37
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,650
and avoid coming to this party.

38
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,850
Your father was given a handkerchief like this, wasn't he?

39
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,850
Yes.

40
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,950
He received a handkerchief with his initials

41
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,150
from Mrs. Kusaka a while ago.

42
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,950
Oh, so he did after all.

43
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,350
Anyone that Kusaka takes a liking to would definitely gets one.

44
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,250
See, I got one too.

45
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,650
But the worse is yet to come.

46
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,350
He's going to keep inviting you to come to his parties.

47
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,950
Well, I advise you to tell your father

48
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,250
to never borrow money from Kusaka.

49
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,650
If he does, he won't be able to turn down attending the party.

50
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,350
So, you've all borrowed money from Mr. Kusaka?

51
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,450
Oh, that's...

52
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,350
Hey, Conan!

53
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,850
You sure hit a sore spot, sonny.

54
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,050
You're absolutely right.

55
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:10,150
All three of us owe Kusaka money.

56
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,950
Mr. Nonaka borrowed money for gambling.

57
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:17,150
Ms. Takano, for management funds for the art gallery that she runs.

58
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:22,150
And me, for money to train myself as a sommelier.

59
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,750
Oh, what are you all talking about?

60
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,150
You all seem to be enjoying the conversation.

61
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,050
Oh, we were just talking about how nice it is

62
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,350
to come to Mr. Kusaka's party

63
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,850
because we get to drink fine wine here.

64
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,950
My husband would be so happy to hear that.

65
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,150
By the way, Mrs. Kusaka,

66
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,450
what do you say we begin wine tasting soon?

67
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,950
He's so absorbed in Mr. Mouri

68
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,850
that it seems he's forgotten about us.

69
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,050
All right, I'll go and tell him right now.

70
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,850
Please do so.

71
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,950
Oh, right!

72
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,050
Now that you're here,

73
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,950
let me show you my wine cellar in the basement.

74
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,450
Huh? Oh, well...

75
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,650
I've got my best wines in there.

76
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,050
Dear.

77
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,050
The other guests are waiting for you to start the wine tasting.

78
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,550
Oh, no!

79
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,550
I had completely forgotten!

80
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,450
Thank God.

81
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,750
Hi, everybody,

82
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,150
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

83
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,850
I thought the party was going to end the way things were going.

84
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,650
Pardon me for my rudeness.

85
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,150
Right! What do you say that

86
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,250
we change plans for wine tasting

87
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,850
and have Mr. Tonomura, the sommelier pick out the right wine?

88
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,850
Well, it does sound interesting.

89
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,950
If he's a sommelier it's only natural

90
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,950
that he chooses all the wines correctly.

91
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,250
Well, if Mr. Kusaka suggest to do so,

92
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,150
he must have some very secret item in his possession.

93
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,250
It is only natural for a sommelier to get the names of the wines right.

94
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,650
But if he misses, he loses face.

95
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,950
Therefore, there's got to be some merit for going through this.

96
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,850
Okay, then let's do this.

97
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,950
If Mr. Tonomura gets all the wines right,

98
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,650
I'll take on the you-know-what thing.

99
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,250
I see.

100
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,850
I guess I'll just have to do it then.

101
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,350
Okay, everyone,

102
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,750
please enjoy yourselves to your heart's content.

103
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,850
Here goes!

104
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,350
Let me see...

105
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,050
It's a good wine.

106
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,950
This is Solaia from the Toscana district in Italy.

107
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,050
Just as expected of you.

108
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,650
Just as expected of you, Mr. Tonomura.

109
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,950
There's far more to go, he's just warming up.

110
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,250
This is very rare wine indeed!

111
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,450
Chateau Latour, isn't it?

112
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,850
Moreover of 1965.

113
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,950
Well, utterly fantastic!

114
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,850
He sure is a true sommelier!

115
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,850
It's as if he knew what wines were going to be given to him!

116
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,150
Not really. Everything so far

117
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,250
requires only a beginner sommelier's knowledge.

118
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,750
Well, I'm so sorry that all the wine

119
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,950
I have offered you to taste so far were all for beginners.

120
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,250
Let me give you the best of my collection, then!

121
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,450
Oh, no.

122
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,050
So he rushes off to his pride and joy wine cellar.

123
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,350
I feel a bit sorry for him.

124
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,350
He's just getting a taste of his own medicine.

125
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,550
Why don't we take a short break, everyone?

126
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,750
I'm a bit tired myself.

127
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:43,250
I'm going to get a bit of fresh air and sober up.

128
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,050
I guess I'll go to the restroom.

129
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,050
Gosh, that sure makes us nervous, right?

130
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,350
Yes.

131
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,750
I can't tell at all.

132
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,600
Mr. Mouri?

133
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,700
Yes?

134
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,300
Don't you think Mr. Kusaka is taking a bit too long?

135
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,500
It's been 40 minutes since he went to his wine cellar.

136
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,700
Has it been that long already?

137
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,500
Excuse me, did you mention my husband?

138
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,000
Oh, Mrs. Kusaka.

139
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,200
It's been 40 minutes since your husband went down to the wine cellar

140
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,900
and he hasn't come back yet.

141
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,500
Goodness. I wonder what he's doing,

142
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,000
making his guests wait like this?

143
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm so sorry, I'll go and get him right away.

144
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,900
Mrs. Kusaka, let me go with you.

145
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,000
After all, something may have happened.

146
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,600
Thank you, please do.

147
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,700
Hey, Conan! Wait!

148
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,000
Please be careful because the stairs is quite steep.

149
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,400
Yes.

150
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,200
Dear?

151
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,700
What's wrong?

152
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,100
Mr. Kusaka!

153
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,650
Mr. Kusaka!

154
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,650
Are you all right, Mr. Kusaka?

155
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,250
Mrs. Kusaka, where's the key to this room?

156
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,150
Huh? Here it is.

157
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,950
Mr. Mouri, how is my husband?

158
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,650
Mrs. Kusaka, please call the police.

159
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,050
Your husband has been killed.

160
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,750
Mrs. Kusaka!

161
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,350
Mrs. Kusaka, please get a hold of yourself!

162
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,550
Mrs. Kusaka!

163
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,450
Why?

164
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:33,650
Why is he lying on the ground in such an unnatural position?

165
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,050
Why?

166
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,460
The victim is Shohei Kusaka, age 52.

167
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:50,060
He is the man of this house and runs a financial institution.

168
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,360
The cause of death is suffocation

169
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,160
due to strangulation by the rope

170
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,260
that was found around his neck.

171
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,760
Can you explain the circumstances when you found the body?

172
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,860
Yes, sir.

173
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,360
Since Mr. Kusaka didn't come back for quite a while,

174
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,960
I came here to check on him together with Mrs. Kusaka.

175
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,260
Then, we found him lying on his back on the floor.

176
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,060
What about the door, was it locked?

177
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,560
Yes.

178
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,560
Inspector!

179
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,060
Mrs. Kusaka told me

180
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,760
that these are the keys that Mr. Kusaka had on him.

181
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,060
It's the key to the wine cellar and to the house.

182
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,560
The door of the wine cellar are auto-locks,

183
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,460
and the only ones who had both keys were Mr. and Mrs. Kusaka.

184
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,060
She's says there are no other spare keys.

185
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,160
So, the door are auto-locks.

186
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,060
Officer Tome, how's the window over there?

187
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,860
Nothing here.

188
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,060
There is dust accumulated on the dust shelf

189
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,360
and there are no traces of anyone having broken in from outside.

190
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,760
Besides, as you can see,

191
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,760
the handle on this window is on the inside.

192
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,260
So, it would be extremely difficult to access the window

193
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,760
from the outside.

194
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,160
Moreover, look there.

195
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,760
That's an alarm system,

196
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,060
so if the window is forced open,

197
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,760
the alarm system is set to go off immediately.

198
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,960
The switch to that alarm system is this.

199
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,260
When you push the switch of the remote control

200
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,160
that is attached to the keys.

201
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,060
The alarm system is turned off

202
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,460
and the window can be opened.

203
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,760
And when the window is closed again,

204
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,960
the alarm system switches back on.

205
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,260
I see.

206
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,960
It'd be impossible for the killer to go in and out of that window.

207
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,160
If so,

208
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,160
we can narrow down the killer quite a bit, right, Inspector?

209
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,960
I mean, the killer is an acquaintance of Mr. Kusaka.

210
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,860
The person probably had Mr. Kusaka himself open the door

211
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,060
and came into the wine cellar.

212
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,260
Then, committed the murder.

213
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,960
Wine bottles were probably cracked and lying around Mr. Kusaka

214
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,860
beause the killer and Mr. Kusaka had a fist fight or something?

215
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,060
Most likely.

216
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,160
But wouldn't that be sort of strange, too?

217
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,160
Take a look over here.

218
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,360
The wine bottles on the very top of the low shelf are toppled.

219
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,560
But there's nothing's wrong with the wine bottles

220
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,060
on the shelves on this side.

221
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,260
If they really had a fist fight in a clustered place like this,

222
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,960
wouldn't everything be more messed up?

223
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,760
I see. That's quite true.

224
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,860
It's just coincidence!

225
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,260
What are these traces on the floor?

226
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,860
The two traces seem to have been made by

227
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,560
rubbing something strongly against the floor.

228
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,460
Inspector, let's go

229
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,860
and take a look at the back of the house.

230
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,060
If there are no traces of anyone having come in

231
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,060
-Wait a second. -from the back door,

232
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,360
somebody in this house is the killer.

233
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,960
Maybe...

234
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,660
There are no traces of the back door

235
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,160
having been broken into.

236
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,860
Maybe a spare key was secretly made...

237
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,460
Oh, I think that is unthinkable.

238
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,760
What do you mean?

239
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,060
The keys of this house

240
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,060
are all special electronic keys.

241
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,760
An electronic key is not something

242
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,660
that you can easily have made in a hardware store in town.

243
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,760
You can't make a spare

244
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,060
unless you place an order to the manufacturer.

245
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,860
Now, it's pretty much definite that the killer

246
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,760
is someone who is within the premises.

247
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,160
Where are the people of this house and the guests?

248
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,660
I have them waiting in the living room.

249
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,260
Okay, let's go hear them out.

250
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,360
Hey, Conan!

251
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,660
Just what do you think you're doing up there?

252
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,160
Oh, well...

253
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,260
I'm just practicing the horizontal bar.

254
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,360
What?

255
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,060
Inspector!

256
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,160
What's the matter, Officer Chiba?

257
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,160
We got a report from the identification officers just now saying

258
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,260
that they found two pairs of fingerprints

259
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,160
other than Mr. Kusaka's and Mrs. Kusaka on the wine cellar's door.

260
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,260
One was that of Yukari Takano, a guest at the party.

261
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,060
And the other one of Jyokichi Tonomura.

262
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,560
What?

263
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,560
Okay, let's go to the living room.

264
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,660
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir.

265
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,760
Officer Chiba. Take care of Conan, will you?

266
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
Yes, sir!

267
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,660
What?

268
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,060
Hey...

269
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,860
Officer Chiba.

270
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,160
What is it, Conan?

271
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,660
You know...

272
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,660
I haven't heard that something like that has been found.

273
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,560
Have you heard anything, Officer Tome?

274
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,860
No, I haven't heard of any such report.

275
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,560
I've found the conclusive evidence.

276
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,160
I'm sure the killer still has it

277
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,460
because the killer haven't been able to throw it away.

278
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,960
What?

279
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,160
Are you saying that the killer is among us?

280
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,860
Please give us a decent explanation, Inspector!

281
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,860
I'm saying that judging from the circumstances at the scene,

282
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,060
it is most likely that someone in this house

283
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,460
had committed the murder.

284
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,560
That goes for you two in particular, Mr. Tonomura and Ms. Takano.

285
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,260
Both of your fingerprints

286
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,060
were found on the door of the wine cellar.

287
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,060
Hey, hold it there, will you?

288
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,760
I did go to the wine cellar!

289
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,260
To ask him to loan me more money.

290
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,160
But I didn't go inside!

291
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,510
How about you, Ms. Takano?

292
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,810
I went to the wine cellar to ask him

293
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,910
to extend the period of which to repay my loan,

294
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,810
but I didn't go inside either!

295
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,810
What about you, Mr. Nonaka?

296
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:32,910
Huh?

297
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,910
After Mr. Kusaka left the room,

298
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,010
I was strolling around the yard.

299
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,610
So, I haven't gone to the wine cellar.

300
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,610
I see.

301
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,210
Where were you, Mrs. Kusaka?

302
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,110
I was in the kitchen the whole time.

303
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,910
In order to go to the wine cellar,

304
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,310
I had to come through this living room

305
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,310
where Mr. Mouri and everyone else were.

306
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,610
I was seated at the table of the living room all the while,

307
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,610
but Mrs. Kusaka never left the living room.

308
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,310
Hey, Pops.

309
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,810
I found something strange in the wine cellar.

310
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,110
Something strange?

311
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:15,210
Hey, Conan. Where is that strange stuff?

312
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,810
I'd like you to call my lawyer!

313
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,810
Right! I won't say a word until then!

314
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,110
Now, now. Please calm down.

315
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,810
Excuse me for a moment.

316
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,410
Hello, Megure here.

317
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,610
What? You've figured out who the killer is?

318
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,510
Everyone, let me explain.

319
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:50,010
How this ruthless murder was committed

320
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,010
and disclosed who did it, too.

321
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,110
Just a while ago, I mentioned that

322
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:57,810
the killer is among the three people here.

323
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,110
There is no doubt about that!

324
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,310
What?

325
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:06,710
First, the two whose fingerprints were found on the door.

326
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,610
Mr. Tonomura and Ms. Takano.

327
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,110
They are not the killers.

328
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,410
Hey, then are you saying that the killer is not here?

329
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:18,110
No, the killer is here.

330
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:22,010
The killer is here? Then...

331
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,010
Yes!

332
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:26,510
The killer is you, Mr. Nonaka!

333
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,110
Wait a minute.

334
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,710
I was in the yard at that time.

335
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,910
I didn't even go near the wine cellar!

336
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,410
Shall we replay the situation then?

337
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,610
First, you went around to the backyard,

338
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,210
and knocked on the window of the wine cellar.

339
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,510
Oh, I forgot to mention the role of the killer

340
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:55,110
will be played by Officer Chiba.

341
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:58,310
Then, Mr. Kusaku turned off the alarm system

342
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,310
and opened the window.

343
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,810
Officer Takagi!

344
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,110
Yes?

345
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,910
Please play the role of the victim.

346
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,010
Yes, sir.

347
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:17,210
Then, Mr. Nonaka lured Mr. Kusaku out into the yard.

348
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,410
Saying something like you would explain what trick

349
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,710
Mr. Tonomura used during the wine tasting.

350
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:29,010
Mr. Nonaka killed Mr. Kusaku in the backyard when he was off guard.

351
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,110
Then Mr. Nonaka went to the backdoor to lock the door

352
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,410
with the keys he took,

353
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,810
and then put the keys back into the victim's pocket.

354
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,310
Wait, Mr. Mouri.

355
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:40,310
Then how did he put Mr. Kusaku into the wine cellar?

356
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,310
Even if he were to throw him in from the window,

357
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:46,010
wouldn't it be impossible to Iie him down in the center of the cellar?

358
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,110
He used the clothes rack pole!

359
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,810
The clothes rack pole?

360
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:54,710
Mr. Nonaka lined two poles up together

361
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,710
and laid the dead body on it like so.

362
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,810
He pulled the pole through Mr. Kusaku's belt

363
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:04,210
to keep the space between the poles from widening.

364
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:08,010
Then he pushed the poles through the window

365
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,010
and if you tilt the angle...

366
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,110
I see!

367
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,810
The wine bottles broke when Mr. Kusaku's legs

368
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,810
knocked them off the shelf!

369
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,410
Finally, the pole is pulled out.

370
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:26,310
It is similar to the time Mr. Kusaku was found,

371
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,810
what about the window?

372
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,610
He hooked a narrow wire or something on the tab of the window

373
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,410
then pulled on it with all his might.

374
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,710
It closed.

375
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:40,210
In this way, it is possible to lie Mr. Kusaku on the floor

376
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:44,210
between the shelves without coming into the wine cellar.

377
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,510
That's all a bunch of baloney!

378
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,710
Do you have evidence?

379
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:52,310
Would you be so kind to show me your handkerchief?

380
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:57,010
The one with your initials on them that Mr. Kusaku gave you.

381
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:01,310
When Mr. Kusaku was dropped, some wine bottles broke.

382
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:04,910
Wine would then naturally splatter onto the poles.

383
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,810
But no wine was found on the poles.

384
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:13,210
That's because you wiped off the wine

385
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,010
to hide your trick of having used the poles.

386
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,810
Since you didn't expect the wine bottles to break,

387
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,010
you wiped it off with the handkerchief you had.

388
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,310
I'm sure you still have it with you

389
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,310
because if you threw it away,

390
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:28,110
it would be obvious that it's yours.

391
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,710
Darn it!

392
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:34,210
He's... he's the one to blame!

393
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,210
He lends money and demands ridiculously high interest.

394
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,010
Then, when it becomes inconvenient for him,

395
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,610
he demands that you pay him back the next day!

396
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:43,410
You've got to be kidding! I've got employees to feed, too!

397
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,310
That's why I did for the sake of everyone else!

398
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,410
You fool!

399
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,710
No matter what your reasons are, murder is murder!

400
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:54,710
You can't look away from the fact that you took someone's life!

401
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,910
Think deeply about it.

402
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,210
Thank you for the good job, Mr. Mouri!

403
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,010
Yes, thank you.

404
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,510
Yes. You, too.

405
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:42,510
Mr. Mouri, I'll make it up to you one of these days.

406
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:48,210
Did I lend him something?

407
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,810
Oh, well...

408
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,410
You can take your time paying me back!

409
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,010
It hurts.

410
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,010
I'm sorry, Officer Takagi.

411
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,440
Next Conan's Hint:

412
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,420
"Car keys"
