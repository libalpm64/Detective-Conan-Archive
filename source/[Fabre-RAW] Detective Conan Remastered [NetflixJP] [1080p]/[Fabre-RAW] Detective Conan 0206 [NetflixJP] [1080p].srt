1
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,340
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,240
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,140
Mystery after mystery, the case of arson and robbery.

4
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,140
The two cases overlap and become one.

5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,740
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,390
After Ayumi says that she had witnessed the arsonist

9
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,990
of the succession of arson cases in the city,

10
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,890
we, the Youth Detective Squad,

11
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,490
Officer Takagi and Sato start investigating the case.

12
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,390
That day also happened to be the memorial day

13
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,090
when Officer Sato's father died on duty,

14
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,390
so his friends during his school days were also having a get together.

15
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:27,190
"Love Story At Headquarters 3 (Part 2)"

16
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,090
What're you doing?

17
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,290
What's the matter? Officer Sato, you're soaking with sweat.

18
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,590
It's this pub, isn't it?

19
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,890
Okay, then let's get off quick!

20
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,290
No.

21
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,190
I'm in there alone.

22
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,190
I'm coming right back, so you all stay put.

23
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,690
Gosh.

24
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,890
What're you doing, Ai?

25
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,890
Since we've got nothing to do while we're waiting,

26
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,490
I thought I'd check the places

27
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,790
that were attacked by the arsonist up to now.

28
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,690
Do any of you remember the places where the fire took place?

29
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,590
Oh, I remember!

30
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,790
All of them happened near the station.

31
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,190
The first happened in Ikebukuro,

32
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,590
the second one in Asakusabashi,

33
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,690
the third in Tabata and the fourth in Shimokitazawa.

34
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,590
The third in Tabata and the fourth in Shimokitazawa...

35
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:26,190
And the fifth is Yotsuya, where Ayumi saw the arsonist.

36
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,690
It's just a simple trapezoid even if connected.

37
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,090
There seems to be no special consistency or anything.

38
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,090
It sure looks like a scooper from here.

39
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,490
You mean a soup ladle, right?

40
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,790
Soup ladle?

41
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,090
Maybe this is the shape of an unfinished Big Dipper?

42
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,990
No. Because if so,

43
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,990
the handle of the ladle should be on the left side.

44
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,890
Hey, Conan. Why don't you help us out?

45
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,390
Huh?

46
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,590
He's gone!

47
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,290
Not again.

48
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,390
What? They left?

49
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,790
All four together?

50
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,890
Yeah, just about 40 minutes ago.

51
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,690
Something about feeling uncomfortable about the arson

52
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,890
still at large in this area, so they left.

53
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,690
Do you know what the four were talking about with each other?

54
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,890
Conan?

55
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,690
Yeah! They were having a ball

56
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,190
saying that good things kept coming.

57
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,790
Mr. Inomata was saying

58
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,690
that today was his company's 15th anniversary.

59
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,990
Something about his company had never been

60
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,890
in the reds since its establishment.

61
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,390
Mr. Kano was saying that tomorrow was his 50th birthday.

62
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,890
He said that his studying in Italy for 3 years bore fruit,

63
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,390
and that his shop was doing just great.

64
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,690
Mrs. Kandori looked happy saying that her daughter just got married

65
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,190
to a well-to-do man yesterday.

66
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,390
As for Mr. Saruwatari, he said that

67
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,590
his son just had their second baby boy this morning,

68
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,990
but he added, he had mixed feelings

69
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,190
because today was also your father's memorial day.

70
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,590
The killer of that case is sure a ruthless one, isn't he?

71
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,790
Not only did the robber take off with 500,000,000 yen,

72
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,190
he killed the security guard that tried to stop him

73
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,690
by hitting him on the head with the rifle

74
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,090
that he had hidden behind his coat.

75
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,390
On top of that, he kills the Police Commissioner.

76
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,190
Killed...

77
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,390
Didn't he die of an accident?

78
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,890
There was a witness.

79
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,290
Huh?

80
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,590
The witness said that it looked to be

81
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,690
that my father was pushed in front of the truck from behind.

82
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,290
I'm sure that Conan's in the store.

83
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,290
He's really good at being sneaky.

84
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,890
Don't tell me he's eating something in there?

85
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,290
Like fried chicken or pork skewers!

86
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:36,490
All you have in your head is eels over rice and meat, don't you?

87
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,090
You'll have to eat vegetables to or you'll die young.

88
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,490
The bad guy was saying something about

89
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,390
he had just one more vegetable and it'll be over.

90
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,390
-Vegetable? -Yes.

91
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,290
Vege, eve or something like that.

92
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,090
Eve?

93
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,190
Just one more and the eve will be over?

94
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,590
Don't tell me that this is...

95
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,790
Gosh! I wonder what he's eating?

96
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,390
Ai?

97
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,390
-I'm closing the door. -Okay.

98
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,990
Hey! No fair, Ai!

99
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,690
What? She's going to eat something!

100
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,490
Stay out until I get back.

101
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,090
Gosh.

102
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,790
How come we end up staying in here?

103
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,390
What's wrong?

104
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,890
He... he's the one!

105
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,890
The bad man that I saw!

106
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,190
What?

107
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,990
But don't you think the shop owner is too well-informed?

108
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,990
What?

109
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,490
Like knowing that he was struck by a rifle.

110
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,290
I knew nothing about it.

111
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,690
On the day of the incident,

112
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,290
the shots that were taken by the surveillance camera

113
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,290
was aired on TV.

114
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,590
It was too violent so it was cut immediately.

115
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,190
I'm more worried about Officer Takagi right now.

116
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,990
The least we need to figure out is

117
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,790
whether the one who attacked him

118
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,990
was the killer of 18 years ago, or the arsonist.

119
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,990
Otherwise, there is no way finding him.

120
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,490
Shinagawa.

121
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,890
Ai?

122
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,190
The next place the arson is going to show up is Shinagawa.

123
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,790
What? Shinagawa?

124
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,390
Look.

125
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,090
Leaving the first arson that occurred in Ikebukuro

126
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,990
and the second arson that occurred in Asakusabashi as is,

127
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,590
then connect the third site of the arson that occurred in Tabata

128
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,590
to the fourth that occurred in Shimokitazawa

129
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,890
with a line to the fifth site, Yotsuya,

130
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,990
over to Shinagawa here.

131
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,590
Fire?

132
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,790
Yes. The arsonist was writing the Japanese kanji character "fire"

133
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,290
on the ground of Tokyo,

134
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,090
in the correct writing order of the word.

135
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,190
Then, don't tell me that the one who attacked Officer Takagi is...

136
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,990
Yes. If the arsonist mistakenly thought

137
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,490
that he had been witnessed, it's possible.

138
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,090
If that were to be true,

139
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,390
there should be a corpse rolling around

140
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,890
nearby the next site of the fire,

141
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,990
just like in the fourth case.

142
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,890
Okay, everybody...

143
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,090
Huh?

144
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,890
What? Oh, no!

145
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,890
The children are gone!

146
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,990
Huh?

147
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,090
Officer Sato.

148
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,790
Officer Shiratori.

149
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,490
Didn't you see the children?

150
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,590
No. Weren't they with you?

151
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,690
Well, you see...

152
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:50,290
Conan, Conan. Can you hear me?

153
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,690
Ayumi!

154
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,690
Hey! Where are you guys and what're you doing?

155
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,090
Don't yell. The killer will hear you!

156
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,590
What? The killer?

157
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,190
The man that Ayumi had seen before

158
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,690
coincidentally walked by the pub,

159
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,790
so we're tailing him now.

160
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,790
What?

161
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,690
We're at the warehouse district in Shinagawa 6-chome right now.

162
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,790
Hey, take a look at that.

163
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,690
He's pouring something onto the newspaper.

164
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,590
What? The guy hasn't set fire yet?

165
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,790
Which means that the one who attacked Officer Takagi

166
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,990
wasn't the arsonist.

167
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,590
Excuse me, Officer Shiratori.

168
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,190
Did you notice anything strange

169
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,790
before parting with Officer Takagi?

170
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,490
I think he was looking up at the board with the names of the stations

171
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,190
on the platform of Shinagawa Station.

172
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,890
Station name board?

173
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,690
I see!

174
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,090
That's why Officer Takagi figured it out.

175
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,590
The meaning of the last words of Officer Sato's father, "Shushiro",

176
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,690
the identity of the "kan-o" that was written in his police book,

177
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,490
and the reason why he was able to specify the killer

178
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,590
with only a few clues.

179
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,290
There's no doubt about it.

180
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,190
The killer is among the four.

181
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,690
And the one who attacked Officer Takagi is also...

182
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,290
Hey, you guys.

183
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,890
We'll head on that way with Officer Shiratori's car right now,

184
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:08,990
so don't move.

185
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:12,290
-Huh? -Let's go in my car, then.

186
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,690
No. Your destination is not there, Officer Sato.

187
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,790
Huh?

188
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,390
You'll have to go and settle the case that happened 18 years ago.

189
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,890
Settle the case?

190
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,790
Perhaps it isn't over yet.

191
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,590
Yeah, that's a good boy. Grow...

192
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,290
Hey, I don't believe it.

193
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,490
He really set fire.

194
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,680
The hint is the row of the Roman alphabet where the letter "na" is.

195
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,480
I'm sure that Officer Takagi realized it

196
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,680
when he was looking at the board with the names of the station on it.

197
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,480
It's a very simple magic of letters.

198
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,580
That person probably also knows where Officer Takagi is.

199
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,280
Although it may be impossible to arrest him now,

200
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,980
he may reveal the truth to you.

201
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,080
The truth of what happened 18 years ago.

202
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,480
Is it going to be okay?

203
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,180
The fire is getting bigger.

204
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,580
I'm sure everything will be all right

205
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,480
because Conan should've contacted the fire department by now.

206
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,580
Don't we need to tail the arsonist?

207
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,180
No! Remember, Conan told us not to move?

208
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,780
But I think that it's been 10 minutes since then already.

209
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,080
No, not even 5 minutes have passed yet.

210
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,080
It's too dark that I can't see.

211
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,380
Now you can see it clearly, can't you? Brats.

212
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,880
Don't worry.

213
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,780
I'll line you all up in a row

214
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,680
as the sacrificial offering of the real carnival

215
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,580
that is about to begin.

216
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,380
Hi, Miwako.

217
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,480
Did you finish work?

218
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,780
Well, sort of.

219
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,280
But as you can see, they're almost ready to close.

220
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,980
Who cares.

221
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,980
Let me at least treat you to a drink.

222
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,380
Tomorrow's your long awaited 50th birthday, isn't it?

223
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,280
I guess so, but at 50,

224
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,680
you don't really care about birthdays anymore.

225
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,080
I'm sure you've been looking forward to the day.

226
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,280
Because after midnight this evening,

227
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,080
the "Shushiro" incident that occurred 18 years ago

228
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,980
will to your joy expire.

229
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,680
Huh?

230
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,780
So, let's toast in celebration, shall we?

231
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,680
Mr. "Kan-o"?

232
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,680
Gosh. What is going on?

233
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,680
I remember! Somebody hit me from behind.

234
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,680
I've got to do something about these handcuffs.

235
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,680
All right! My gun's still here!

236
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,580
Okay, I'll shoot the chain off.

237
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,080
Kan-o.

238
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,280
The three mysterious letters

239
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,880
that were written in my father's police I.D. book.

240
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,480
If written in Roman letters, it is read "KANO".

241
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,880
If "n" is put together with the vowel "0", it is read...

242
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,680
Kano.

243
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,080
I called Mr. Saruwatari and the others

244
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,180
and confirmed with them too just a while ago.

245
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,080
They told me that "Kan-o" is probably the nickname my father gave you

246
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,180
when you used to play baseball together in your school days.

247
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,080
But until I asked them about it,

248
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,880
they told me that they thought you used to be called by a strange name,

249
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,280
something like Kan-o" or "Kao".

250
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,080
They never really figured out for sure what you were being called.

251
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,780
The reason why my father specified you as the suspect was because

252
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,980
he saw the picture of the man who hit the security guard with the rifle

253
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,280
on the surveillance camera.

254
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,480
Father used to always tell me

255
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,480
that although you had a unique batting form,

256
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,580
you were the most skilled batter of the team.

257
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,980
You've got to be kidding,

258
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,580
suspecting me as the killer just because of something like that.

259
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,280
Besides, that case expired 3 years ago, didn't it?

260
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,980
No, not yet.

261
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,380
To put it accurately, there's still 8 minutes and 17 seconds to go.

262
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,080
You should know that if the suspect goes abroad,

263
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,580
the period that the suspect is abroad is counted out.

264
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,980
I've already checked it out with the Ministry of Justice.

265
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,880
And I've also figured out that you set it up

266
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,480
to come back from Italy on your 50th birthday,

267
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,480
so that you wouldn't forget the expiration date of the case.

268
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,380
No! Not until you tell me what really happened.

269
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,080
What?

270
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,680
Father used to say that

271
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,380
a suspect who is on the verge of confessing the crime

272
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,880
always gulps and reaches out for a cup of tea.

273
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,980
And if you give the suspect the tea,

274
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,480
he will swallow the confession together with the tea.

275
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,480
I won't let you swallow this case into yourself.

276
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,080
Not even if your throat gets so parched

277
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,380
that you dry out and wither!

278
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,880
Ayumi!

279
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,380
No...

280
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,180
-Let go of me! -You all come here quietly too.

281
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,780
Hey.

282
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,580
What's another way of saying,

283
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,380
being kicked in the rear end?

284
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,380
Butt kick...

285
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,980
Right.

286
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,280
I sure kicked something really stupid again.

287
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,380
Officer Shiratori! This way!

288
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,480
-Huh? -This way...

289
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,880
Hurry!

290
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,580
A can of kerosene and matches.

291
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,580
I think we've really got him this time.

292
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,780
Is that warehouse going to be all right, letting it burn on like that?

293
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,980
It's burning pretty badly.

294
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,380
That warehouse was scheduled to be demolished next week anyway,

295
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,880
and it's empty inside.

296
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,480
Besides, the firefighters are busy extinguishing the fire now.

297
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,380
Darn it!

298
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,880
Congratulations.

299
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,680
I lose.

300
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,880
I had no intention of killing him.

301
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,180
Huh?

302
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,580
You mean my father?

303
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,480
No! The security guard!

304
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,680
I just tried to brush him away,

305
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,480
but I seem to have hit him in the wrong place.

306
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,780
What about my father, then?

307
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:19,380
You kicked him at the intersection, didn't you?

308
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,080
No. I'm the one who was kicked.

309
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,180
Huh?

310
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,080
Back then, he saw through all of me

311
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,880
and I was about to be taken to the station by him.

312
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,780
I suddenly got scared

313
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,880
when I thought about my future

314
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,180
that I dashed out in front of the truck...

315
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,880
Then he...

316
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,580
He pushed me...

317
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,080
He gave me another chance to do my life over again.

318
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,480
But even if you start over with the money you robbed...

319
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,680
No! I haven't touched that money!

320
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,780
I have it hidden under the Buddhist altar at home.

321
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,080
I was planning to give the money back

322
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,180
as soon as the case expired.

323
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,680
This is true! Please believe me!

324
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,080
Sure, I'll believe you.

325
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,980
Officer Chiba, did you hear all that?

326
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,380
Yes, all of it.

327
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,780
Get a warrant immediately and confiscate everything.

328
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,580
If the license number matches, we've no better proof.

329
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,880
Attach the tape of this conversation onto the money

330
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,080
and send it in to the criminal Investigation section.

331
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,080
Make sure he is indicted today, understand?

332
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,080
Yes!

333
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,780
Hurry, because we've only got one day left!

334
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,380
One day left?

335
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,080
You mean you didn't realize

336
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,680
that when you came back from Italy,

337
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,080
remember, there was a typhoon?

338
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,780
Yeah.

339
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,480
The flight that was scheduled to arrive at 21:00,

340
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,280
was delayed and arrived at 00:04.

341
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,080
Which means that your calculation of the expiration date of the case,

342
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,480
was one day off.

343
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,280
My sympathies.

344
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,680
I had a bad feeling

345
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,880
because your face when you came here today

346
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,580
Iooked just like your father's back then.

347
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,880
If you refused to confess,

348
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,980
I was ready to turn your house over

349
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,980
and look for the money in order to arrest you.

350
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,280
But my father was different.

351
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,780
He could've told me your name in the ambulance,

352
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,980
but he believed you, so he didn't.

353
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,480
My father turned towards you

354
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,780
as you fled from the intersection and said,

355
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,480
"Turn yourself in."

356
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,180
Because his gasping remark sounded like "Shushiro"

357
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:38,380
to the people who were there at that time, they heard wrong.

358
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,880
Now, tell me where Officer Takagi is.

359
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,380
Where is he?

360
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,980
Inside a dilapidated warehouse in Shinagawa 6-chome.

361
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,080
I was going to report it to the police later and inform them though.

362
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,280
Hey, that's...

363
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,080
Is that true?

364
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,280
Is Officer Takagi really in there?

365
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,480
If so, he's probably already...

366
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,780
What do you think you're saying? You'll still make it!

367
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,980
Move!

368
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,280
No, Officer Sato!

369
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,780
Move, I said!

370
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,280
You idiot.

371
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,580
I have been appointed here today.

372
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,880
My name is Wataru Takagi!

373
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,780
Uh, Officer Sato...

374
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,780
Officer Sato?

375
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,180
Officer Sato!

376
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,680
You idiot, idiot!

377
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,580
It seems that today is my super lucky day.

378
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,380
You idiot Takagi!

379
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,980
Oh, yes.

380
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,080
I'm sorry.

381
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,880
-Takagi! -Just what are you doing there?

382
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,980
Well, I'm...

383
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,480
When I pulled on the bars, it came off

384
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,280
so I got out through the window.

385
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,180
I was walking back and forth,

386
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,980
then was mistaken for one of the onlookers.

387
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,380
Hey!

388
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,580
-Get an ambulance! -Hurry!

389
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,780
Yes, sir!

390
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,380
How can you walk around hurt like this?

391
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,580
What? Come on, you've got your gun!

392
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,780
Why didn't you use your gun to blow the chain off the handcuffs?

393
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,080
He didn't want to break those handcuffs.

394
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,280
That's your father's keepsake, isn't it, Officer Sato?

395
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,980
That's why he didn't use his gun.

396
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,880
Really cool.

397
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,980
He's the type that'll die young.

398
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,580
You fool.

399
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,780
Huh? Never mind, I don't deserve any token of appreciation.

400
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,180
No! A promise is a promise.

401
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:08,580
Okay, then could I ask you out, just the two of us?

402
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,280
Is that all you want?

403
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,480
Okay, then wait for me next Saturday at 18:00

404
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,180
in front of the main entrance of the Budokan.

405
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,180
I'm sorry!

406
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,080
Did you wait long?

407
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,780
No, I just got here too.

408
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,380
I'm sorry.

409
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,880
Remember the arsonist? He started confessing,

410
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,080
so I got all absorbed.

411
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,680
Let's not talk about work.

412
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,880
Right, we're dating today!

413
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,380
Right!

414
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,180
Sato here.

415
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,280
I've caught sight of the younger sister of the guy in question.

416
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,080
-Huh? -Okay, keep tailing her.

417
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,680
Make sure she doesn't fine out that you're a cop.

418
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,680
Yes, sir.

419
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,780
Officer Sato. Don't tell me that this is...

420
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,280
Okay, let's go, Officer Takagi.

421
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,180
Wait...

422
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,880
Officer Sato!

423
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,420
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,220
"Cassette tape"

425
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,120
Next time is the number one face off.

426
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,200
-I'm gonna go nuts! -Me, too.
