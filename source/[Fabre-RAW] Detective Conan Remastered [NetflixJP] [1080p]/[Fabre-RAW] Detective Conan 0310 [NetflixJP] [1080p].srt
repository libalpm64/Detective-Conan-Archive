1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,640
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,740
Black entanglement also unravels.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,540
The conspiracy of the Black Organization is about to be confirmed.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,040
The truth becomes clearer after one incident and another.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,340
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,860
Dr. Agasa and I got a hint of coming in contact with

9
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,660
the Black Organization from the diary of Mr. Itakura who had been killed.

10
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,560
Therefore, we came over to Mr. Itakura's villa.

11
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,060
Then...

12
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,360
Hey, what's going on?

13
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,660
Vodka?

14
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,360
You're there, aren't you?

15
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,060
They've found out.

16
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,460
They've found out that we failed to open the e-mail.

17
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,560
Yes.

18
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,660
Hey, answer me.

19
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,960
I know you're at that villa.

20
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,560
Shinichi?

21
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,960
Hurry up and answer me,

22
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,360
Mr. Itakura.

23
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,360
Hey!

24
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,860
"Contact with the Black Organization (Pursuit Edition)"

25
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,560
Hey, answer me.

26
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,860
I know you're at that villa.

27
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,760
Hurry up and answer me,

28
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,560
Mr. Itakura.

29
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,160
I guess we've no choice

30
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,060
but to make it out the back door

31
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,360
and hide in the blizzard.

32
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,360
Oh, sorry. It's so dark in here

33
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,160
that I was having trouble picking up the phone.

34
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,660
It seems that the electrical circuit went out

35
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,360
because of this blizzard,

36
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,260
I couldn't open the mail because of this, too.

37
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,060
That's what you get for trying to receive mail

38
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,260
in a mountain villa like that.

39
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,860
Hey, wait a minute.

40
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,960
How come your answer phone's working despite the blackout?

41
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,260
Well, blackouts are frequent in this area because it snows a lot.

42
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,860
That's why I'm using a phone equipped with a built-in battery.

43
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,160
I see.

44
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,460
It's amazing how you found out I was here.

45
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,760
"Please turn on the light" -We know all about you.

46
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,760
Don't tell me you were keeping watch over this villa, were you?

47
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,460
We weren't, don't worry.

48
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,860
Just as promised,

49
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,660
we're nowhere near you.

50
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:22,460
You're finished with that system software in question, I hope.

51
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,460
Yes, somehow.

52
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,860
Is there anyone with you?

53
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,360
Hey, answer me!

54
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,260
What is that sound just now?

55
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,160
Sound?

56
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,460
It's the wind.

57
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,960
The sound of the wind tapping on the window.

58
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,560
That's right, it's snowing heavily over there, too.

59
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,860
So, I can't use the computer.

60
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,960
I hate to say this, but would you give me the info directly?

61
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,960
The time and place of where I should hand this software over to you.

62
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,960
All right, fine.

63
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,060
I'll say it just once, so listen well.

64
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,760
You know the station that's under construction called "Kenbashi"?

65
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,460
The fashionable station that's going to be added to the Toto Subway Line.

66
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,560
Tomorrow morning at midnight,

67
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,460
come and wait in front of coin locker number 0032

68
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,960
located on the basement floor of the station.

69
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,960
Don't forget to bring the system software, got that?

70
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,860
No. Tomorrow's a bad day.

71
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,460
What?

72
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,360
I'm going to have to be hospitalized from this evening for a health check.

73
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,860
You know about it, don't you?

74
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,560
About my bad heart condition.

75
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,260
Don't tell me that you're trying to buy time

76
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,060
because you still haven't completed that software?

77
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,160
No, of course not.

78
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,560
The software is complete.

79
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,560
Then, when is it convenient for you?

80
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,160
After I'm discharged from the hospital,

81
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,760
so about three to four days later.

82
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,460
No, give me five days.

83
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,860
Nonsense. We can't wait that long.

84
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,760
Postpone your hospitalization appointment.

85
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,360
I finally got an appointment with a famous heart surgeon,

86
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,360
so I can't change the date.

87
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,060
If I were to hand it over to you before I enter the hospital,

88
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,860
it has to be today, but the construction workers will be there at daybreak.

89
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,560
It's not convenient for you guys then, isn't it?

90
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,360
At 4 am, then.

91
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,460
Four hours from now at 4 am.

92
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,760
Bring the software to the place I told you.

93
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,860
Four hours from now?

94
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,360
From Gunma to Tokyo?

95
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,560
What's the problem?

96
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
If it's completed,

97
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,960
you should be able to bring it with you, shouldn't you?

98
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,560
Okay.

99
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,360
Four hours from now, I'll take it there.

100
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,760
But don't ambush me.

101
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,260
If I spot any of your people, this entire deal is off.

102
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,860
Even if you were to force this software away from me,

103
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,260
keep in mind that doing so may throw the method

104
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,560
of using this software into the pits of darkness forever.

105
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,560
You're sure a cautious fellow, just like rumor has it.

106
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,260
Okay. Four hours from now,

107
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,160
in front of locker number 0032

108
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,560
at the basement of Kenbashi Station.

109
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,560
-Don't be late. -Yes.

110
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,760
All right, I got them.

111
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,560
Hey, just what do you intend to do?

112
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,660
Don't tell me that you're going to listen to them

113
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,460
and take that software over?

114
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,760
I'm not listening to them.

115
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,560
I lead the conversation so that the handover time of the software

116
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,960
would be rushed to 4 this morning,

117
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,260
by sounding flustered.

118
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,360
What?

119
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,560
The news of Mr. Itakura's death

120
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,560
may be aired when morning comes, right?

121
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,460
If they find out,

122
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,660
this deal as well as clues about them will go down the drain.

123
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,460
Now, the jewelry robber who is at large...

124
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,960
Fortunately, it seems

125
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,660
that none of the news stations are covering news about his case yet.

126
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,460
Which means this is what you intended to do, to begin with?

127
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,760
Yes, I was planning to tell them

128
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,060
to rush the hand over time to an earlier time

129
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,360
when I receive the e-mail from them.

130
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,660
So, let's erase all traces of us having been here

131
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,760
and get out of here with your beetle.

132
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,660
Out of here?

133
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:06,060
They may be watching us from somewhere around this villa, right?

134
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,660
If we carelessly go out just like that to the car that's parked outside,

135
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,760
they may spot us.

136
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,460
Don't worry.

137
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,860
If Vodka or any of his people were around,

138
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,560
they would've easily seen through my lie

139
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,860
that I couldn't use the computer

140
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,460
because the circuit was cut off by the blizzard.

141
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,360
I see.

142
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,460
That's why you asked me to turn on the lights to this villa?

143
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,660
Yes.

144
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,960
We know at the least that none of his people is at a distance

145
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,360
where they can see the lights of the villa.

146
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,060
They probably tracked this place,

147
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,860
using some alarm system that would warn them

148
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,960
and specify the computer of the one they're sending the mail to,

149
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,660
just in case the mail that they sent

150
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,160
isn't opened by the receiver of the mail.

151
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,360
Either way, part of the members of the group will be arrested.

152
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,860
I'll confirm the contents of this software

153
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,760
with the laptop computer in the beetle,

154
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,160
and if it's some outrageous software

155
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,760
that could be used for a hideous crime or something.

156
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,460
You're going to report it to the police,

157
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,360
and specify the place of the deal,

158
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,060
so they can ambush the culprits and arrest whoever shows up, right?

159
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,460
Yes.

160
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,460
Darn. No good.

161
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,860
We need to enter a password for this software, too.

162
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,260
Just like the e-mail,

163
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,760
a password is been set between Mr. Itakura and those guys.

164
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,360
Then, just make a copy of it for now.

165
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,860
I can't do that either.

166
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,060
It's protected with a copy guard.

167
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,860
Under this condition, the police won't move.

168
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,160
Aren't they always secretly armed with guns?

169
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,860
If you report that there will be a deal involving guns,

170
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,160
maybe at least two or three officers will come.

171
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,360
We don't even know how many those guys have on their side.

172
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,560
So, with only a small number on our side,

173
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,060
we're more likely to be biting off our heads.

174
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,160
Unless we find out what their purpose is,

175
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,660
and present evidence to the police as to how dangerous they are,

176
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,460
as well as how large their organization is,

177
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,360
and have the police come equipped with sufficient men,

178
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,060
it'll be difficult to lay our hands on them.

179
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,060
How frustrating.

180
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,760
We know that they're coming

181
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,460
and yet we can't do a thing about it.

182
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,060
Not really. There's still one way.

183
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,060
It's a bit dangerous, though.

184
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,460
Hey, don't tell me that you're planning to meet them directly?

185
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,860
Hey, Dr. Agasa.

186
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,460
Don't tell me that...

187
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,260
Yes, you're most probably right.

188
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,060
It's a flat after all.

189
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,960
We've got to call a nearby service station

190
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,160
and have them bring us over a spare tire.

191
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,760
Is it going to work?

192
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,460
I don't think there's any service station

193
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,460
that'll come at this time of night.

194
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,160
Well, we may as well relax and wait in the car then.

195
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,160
We won't make it in time for meeting those guys if we do that!

196
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,360
I'm sure that this is God's way of telling you

197
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,160
to keep from taking dangerous action, Shinichi.

198
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,460
Darn.

199
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,160
A car?

200
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,360
Hey!

201
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,860
What's up?

202
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,660
Oh, well. We got a flat.

203
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,260
We want to go back to Tokyo,

204
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,060
but won't you give us a lift?

205
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,560
Tokyo?

206
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,860
What do you say?

207
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,060
Why not? We're going in that direction anyway.

208
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,760
Gramps, are you familiar with the roads around here?

209
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,560
Well, yes, sort of.

210
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,360
Okay, you get in the front seat, gramps.

211
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,160
And the kid in the backseat.

212
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,960
Thanks.

213
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,160
I'm sorry to intrude on you when you were sleeping, miss.

214
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,960
It's okay, I was just kind of dozing.

215
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,260
Cool! This is a foreign car, isn't it?

216
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,660
Is this car yours, sir?

217
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,860
Yes, I've gotten tired of it

218
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,860
and was just thinking of getting myself another car, though.

219
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,760
You must be rich,

220
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,160
because this car is really expensive.

221
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,560
Sort of.

222
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,060
Although he may not look it,

223
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,460
he's the heir to a big company, you know.

224
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,560
Goodness!

225
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,860
That sure was close.

226
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,360
Snowy roads are dangerous after all.

227
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,460
Well, let's not rush and drive safely.

228
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:51,160
Hey, didn't you hear something funny just now?

229
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,560
Really? I didn't hear anything.

230
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,060
The stuff that we have in the trunk probably moved.

231
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,260
It's nothing to sweat about.

232
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,760
Hey, don't smoke!

233
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,360
Did you forget that I hate cigarettes?

234
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,060
Oh, sorry. That's right.

235
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,560
Oh, to go to Tokyo turn left there.

236
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,160
All right.

237
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,360
It's stopped snowing

238
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,860
so I guess we can get there before 3 am.

239
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,360
But why were you guys in Gunma?

240
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,760
Were you skiing with your grandson?

241
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,860
I guess you could say so.

242
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,260
Sounds great.

243
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,860
Hey. Watch where you're going.

244
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,360
Sorry, sorry.

245
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,360
I shouldn't have driven in the snow after all.

246
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,160
Strange.

247
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,460
There's something fishy about them.

248
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,660
Don't tell me that...

249
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,360
Don't tell me that they're...

250
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,280
What's with you anyway?

251
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,080
How many times do you think you got honked at already?

252
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,980
Didn't I tell you that I'm not good at driving on snowy roads?

253
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,380
You're right! This car needs a tune-up

254
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,580
and hasn't got its safety check yet,

255
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,680
so you've got to drive more carefully!

256
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,280
You're going to get a safety check for this car soon, aren't you?

257
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,580
Yes, I guess so.

258
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,980
You don't remember?

259
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,580
The number 2 is written on the sticker on the windshield.

260
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,780
That's the inspection certificate

261
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,280
and depending on the number and the color of the sticker.

262
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,280
It tells you

263
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,880
when you're supposed to be getting your next safety check, right?

264
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,180
The color is this year's color,

265
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,180
so it's obvious that you have to get your safety check

266
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,080
by February this year.

267
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,380
Oh, that's right. I remember now.

268
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,680
Come to think of it, I got a postcard saying

269
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,780
for me to go get my safety check within this month.

270
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,780
But, sonny, when did you see it?

271
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,280
The sticker was covered with snow.

272
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,880
See. I saw it when the on-coming car passed us.

273
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,080
When the headlights shined on it,

274
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,680
the number outside could be seen transparent from the back.

275
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,780
Oh, I see! I thought it was "2"

276
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,280
because I saw it transparent from behind but it was actually "5"!

277
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,880
But, that's strange.

278
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,880
You got a postcard saying that you

279
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,480
had to go get a safety check within the month of February, right?

280
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,180
I wonder why?

281
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,480
Oh, well, you see... That's...

282
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,880
Didn't I just tell you a while ago,

283
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,280
that he's a Richie Rich, sonny?

284
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,980
That's why he leaves all the details up to others to do it for him.

285
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,780
He answered you casually but the thing is,

286
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,680
he's not even bothered about the date of the safety check.

287
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,980
You've got to turn right over there,

288
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,380
or we won't make it to Tokyo.

289
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,580
Gosh. The kid keeps blabbing on, so...

290
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,580
I'm sorry, he's such a curious child.

291
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,380
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

292
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,780
Okay, there.

293
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,880
By the way,

294
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,080
what are you listening to, sonny?

295
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,580
Oh, this?

296
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,280
I'm listening to the news.

297
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,580
News?

298
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,580
Yes. There are all kinds of news.

299
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:53,180
About economy picking up and the new coach of Big Osaka.

300
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,980
Or about the jewelry robber who is on the run.

301
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,780
You're still so little, yet you like news.

302
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,480
Yes.

303
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,580
And? Was the robber caught?

304
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,080
No.

305
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,180
They're still escaping somewhere in the Gunma area.

306
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,380
But I'm sure they'll be arrested soon.

307
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,380
Because... Look.

308
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,780
They seem to have checkpoints here there

309
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,980
and everywhere like over there.

310
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,580
License, please.

311
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,880
Yes.

312
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,280
Excuse me, but where did you come from?

313
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,280
Well...

314
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,980
Officer Yamamura!

315
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,280
You're... you're Conan if I remember correctly.

316
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,080
Officer Yamamura, this is a checkpoint

317
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,580
to arrest the jewelry shop robbers, right?

318
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,180
Yes.

319
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,880
There are a group of three wearing baseball caps.

320
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,580
After robbing a jewelry shop in Gunma,

321
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,980
they abandoned the car they made their getaway with in the mountains

322
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,980
and vanished.

323
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,780
But one of the three is hurt,

324
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,780
so I don't think they got too far away yet.

325
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,180
Hurt?

326
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,580
Right.

327
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,080
When we got the report,

328
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,980
I just happened to be nearby doing some questioning.

329
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,080
When I got to the scene of the crime,

330
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,180
I happened to run into the robbers

331
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,680
who fled out of the shop.

332
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,480
So I pulled out my gun and said,

333
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,380
"Freeze. Freeze or I'll shoot".

334
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,580
Cool!

335
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,480
But the robbers refused to stop

336
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,680
so I fired a warning shot towards them.

337
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,680
Hey.

338
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,580
And, I hit one of the robbers in the thigh!

339
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,280
Well, anyway,

340
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,980
either they had another car stashed away in the mountains beforehand,

341
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,480
or they stole a car that coincidentally passed through

342
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,080
and are on the run.

343
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,580
Didn't you see some suspicious-looking people?

344
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,580
Yes, I did.

345
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,280
You mean people who are riding in a car that is not theirs, right?

346
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,180
That's us!

347
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,580
My car tire went flat in the mountains,

348
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,780
so we had them give us a lift.

349
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,480
Right.

350
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,680
Dr. Agasa, where is your car, then?

351
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,680
I called the car dealer

352
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,580
and they said they'd come get it in the morning,

353
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,680
so I left it in the mountains with the key inside.

354
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,480
Then, isn't your car in trouble?

355
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,580
Maybe the robbers got a hold of it

356
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,580
and are riding it around.

357
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,180
That's possible.

358
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,480
Then, maybe you shouldn't be bothering with us

359
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,780
and keeping watch over that car.

360
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,980
It's a yellow beetle, so it's easy to spot.

361
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:57,080
How strange. Your voices sound familiar.

362
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,280
I don't think so.

363
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,680
So, may we go now, officer?

364
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:09,180
Will you take that jacket you have over your lap, just in case?

365
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,680
Hey! Don't tell me you suspect us?

366
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,080
See, I haven't been shot or anything!

367
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,980
I guess not.

368
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,780
Be careful, then.

369
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,880
Hello? This is the Agasa residence.

370
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,080
The Gunma Prefectural police?

371
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,880
According to Dr. Agasa, he said that the dealers

372
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,380
would be picking his car up in the morning.

373
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,880
But, leaving the car as is in the mountains

374
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,380
may give the robbers a chance to use it,

375
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,680
so we have decided to tow it away for now.

376
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:01,480
So, please tell him to come and pick his car up at the station.

377
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,580
Yes, I will.

378
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,780
Goodbye, then.

379
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,080
Thank you.

380
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,480
I wonder what they're doing in Gunma at this time of day?

381
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,480
I'll bet he was talked into by Shinichi again

382
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,480
and went sticking their noses into a criminal case or something.

383
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,980
Seriously.

384
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,080
I don't see what thrill they find in

385
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,780
looking for faults in others at the cost of losing sleep.

386
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,780
I see no fun at all in playing detective.

387
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,280
A spare pair of pursuit glasses.

388
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,480
Yes, we're going to pick up the stuff earlier than scheduled.

389
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,280
An hour from now, at 4 am.

390
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,880
The place remains unchanged.

391
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,980
It's in front of the locker in the basement of Kenbashi Subway Station.

392
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,880
Tell Gin about this too, will you?

393
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,480
Yes, of course.

394
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,680
Get the men ready armed with guns.

395
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,680
He could've gone chicken and called the cops.

396
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:21,180
Either way, after the deal, it's good riddance with him anyway.

397
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,380
We were planning to get rid of him inside Kenbashi Station to begin with.

398
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,780
Next Conan's Hint:

399
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,480
"Coin Locker"
