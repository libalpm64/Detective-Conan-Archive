1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,940
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,040
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,840
Ai gets messed up in the Porsche case.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,740
Jodie, Araide and Vermouth appear.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,340
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,060
"Four Porsches (Part 2)"

9
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,860
The victim is Mr. Yukiya Banba, age 41.

10
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,960
The cause is death by suffocation.

11
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,960
From the traces left on his neck,

12
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,060
it seems he was choked by a string-like object.

13
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,560
"Yukiya Banba (41)" -Moreover, it seems...

14
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,460
he was choked with quite some strength.

15
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,960
And? Who is the one that found the corpse?

16
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,460
He's the one.

17
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,360
He seems to have gone golfing with the victim

18
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,760
and stopped by here on their way back.

19
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,160
Who are the two people standing behind you?

20
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,460
Oh, yes. They are also golf friends.

21
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,860
As well as Porsche friends.

22
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,960
Conan?

23
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,360
You're also Porsche friends, right?

24
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,060
How did you know?

25
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,760
I came to this department store with Dr. Agasa and got off the car.

26
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,060
Then I saw them park their cars too,

27
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,060
and I talked to them a bit.

28
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,260
Where's Dr. Agasa then?

29
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,460
I think he's still shopping upstairs.

30
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,560
And, Conan...

31
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,360
Will you give me more of the details back then?

32
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,960
It was about 1:00 in the afternoon.

33
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,360
4 people came on this white Porsche

34
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,260
and only 3 got off.

35
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,360
They were saying that they were going to shop here

36
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,460
until that man's booze wears off.

37
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,660
It seems as if

38
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,560
they were going to leave after a while on their own cars.

39
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,060
Which means that these 4 Porsches are yours?

40
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,260
Yes.

41
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,560
Inspector Megure.

42
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,660
A moment.

43
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,660
Did you find anything?

44
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,760
Yes.

45
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,360
Thank you.

46
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,160
It seems that the suspects have been

47
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,760
narrowed down to you three.

48
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,260
What?

49
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,560
As a result of the autopsy,

50
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,860
the estimated time of death is around 13:00.

51
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,860
Just about the time you all got here.

52
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,860
In other words,

53
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,660
it is extremely likely that one of you

54
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,560
strangled Mr. Banba when getting off the car.

55
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,460
Well, it may be a different story

56
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,260
if you left the car unlocked when you got off.

57
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,460
I locked the door for sure!

58
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,760
He was still alive when we got off.

59
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,760
What?

60
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,560
Mr. Hotei, Ms. Taiyama. Is it true?

61
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,260
Yeah. He was wasted and talking in his sleep.

62
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,460
Saying something like "Another OB".

63
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,460
Besides, we all got off at about the same time,

64
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,160
so nobody had time to strangle anybody.

65
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,360
Well, please tell us more in detail.

66
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,960
Please give me your names

67
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,860
and your relationship with Mr. Banba who had been killed,

68
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,760
the order in which you got off the car

69
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,060
and which car you own.

70
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,660
I'm the first one who got off.

71
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,560
My name is Yoshihito Kureko.

72
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,660
I got to know Mr. Banba at the Porsche new car exhibition.

73
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,060
My car is this Porsche 911 here.

74
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,060
When we go golfing, I park my car here

75
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,260
and all four of us get on this car

76
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,260
and head off together in one car,

77
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,460
just like that boy mentioned.

78
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,660
We got off in order to wait for Mr. Banba's booze to wear off

79
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,460
and decided to kill time at the department store.

80
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,160
But I realized that I had left my cell phone in the car

81
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,260
so I came back to get it, only to see how I found him.

82
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,060
Which means,

83
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,160
you're the only one who could've killed him

84
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,860
without being seen by anyone.

85
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,660
No! I came back to the car about an hour later though.

86
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,960
What is this?

87
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,560
This box in the dashboard compartment?

88
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,260
A music box.

89
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,060
The pin broke, so I was thinking of sending it out for repair.

90
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,060
But I had completely forgotten it was here.

91
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,360
It seems to be working okay.

92
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,160
I guess you can't strangle somebody using something like this though.

93
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,960
I'm the one who got off after him. My name's Eiji Hotei.

94
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,860
I used to car race with him on mountain roads.

95
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,860
That is when we were young.

96
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,660
I'm into antique-like cars recently,

97
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:17,260
and bought a Porsche 356A that was made 50 years ago.

98
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,960
Excuse me.

99
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,160
Huh? There's something in the backseat.

100
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,260
There.

101
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,660
Those are my fishing goods.

102
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,360
I'm kind of into fishing lately.

103
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,360
You've even got an electric reel.

104
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,860
If this is used, you could choke his neck automatically.

105
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,760
Cut out that talk!

106
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,360
The reel was in the bag, wasn't it?

107
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,760
I came back here after I received call from Mr. Kureko

108
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,960
and haven't even touched the car yet.

109
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,460
I'm Kaoru Taiyama.

110
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,360
It's true that I was the last one who got off,

111
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,560
but do you think that a woman like me

112
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,460
would be strong enough to strangle a man to death?

113
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,760
Besides, after golf, my gripping strength is weakened as is.

114
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,960
And?

115
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,660
What is your relationship with Mr. Banba?

116
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,160
Nothing special.

117
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,660
I just got into talking with him about Porsches on the golf course

118
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,960
and started making rounds with him.

119
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,660
This Boxter that I got right after it came out on the market

120
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,760
caught Mr. Banba's eyes.

121
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,560
You have something in the passenger's seat, too.

122
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,060
Oh, that. It's a gift for the son of my cousin.

123
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,660
It's a radio controlled Porsche.

124
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,060
I could never strangle someone's neck with it, could I?

125
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,260
And besides, after getting off the car to go shopping,

126
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,260
I came back here after I got a call from Mr. Kureko

127
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,860
saying that something awful had happened to Mr. Banba.

128
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,960
But I haven't touched a thing!

129
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,560
Hey! Why don't you look at that?

130
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,760
-A surveillance camera? -I see!

131
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,560
I'm pretty sure we can find out if someone is lying.

132
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,960
-Okay, to the security room! -Yes, sir.

133
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,360
Will all of you please come with me, too?

134
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,660
-What? -I guess we don't have a choice.

135
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,760
I told you to stay still!

136
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,560
But Ai doesn't look too good.

137
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,060
I figured we should take her to the doctor.

138
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,460
We can't leave her like this.

139
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,560
I guess we have no choice.

140
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,760
Just to be safe, maybe we should ask Officer Takagi

141
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,060
to secretly let us out with his police car.

142
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,560
Because they may be ambushing us outside.

143
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,660
Hi!

144
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,960
Who are they?

145
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,960
Conan, you were mixed up in this case after all.

146
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,760
Well... Yes.

147
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,560
But, how did you get in here?

148
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,760
Only those from the police

149
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,060
and those who are involved in the case are let in, right?

150
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,160
We told them that we came to pick you up, then they let us in.

151
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,960
-Right, Ran? -Right.

152
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,160
Huh?

153
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,260
Ai is here, too?

154
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,160
Come to think of it, you're some detective, aren't you?

155
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,860
We're going to the security room to look over the surveillance camera,

156
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,360
so won't you come along?

157
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,360
Come on, let's go.

158
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,560
Okay, Sonoko?

159
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,960
Hey! Jodie, you too.

160
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,560
Let's go!

161
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Hey, Conan.

162
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,660
Reddish...

163
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,960
Brown hair.

164
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,360
What're you both doing?

165
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,760
Ms. Taiyama and Mr. Hotei?

166
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,560
After you got off the car,

167
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,660
both of you have gone back to your cars.

168
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:05,060
I just went back to get my wallet.

169
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,060
Mr. Kureko always paid the golfing charges ahead of time, so...

170
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,160
So after this, all three of you

171
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,960
went into the department store together to shop,

172
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,960
and until Mr. Kureko went back to get his cell phone an hour later,

173
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,860
nobody went near the car?

174
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,560
So, didn't I tell you that

175
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,260
it was impossible for us to commit the murder?

176
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,860
It's unreasonable to think

177
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,160
that they would call the police knowing that they'd be suspected.

178
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,660
Besides, all three of them got off the car at about the same time.

179
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,160
There wasn't anything strange about their moves.

180
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,060
I can't make it out.

181
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,760
How did the murderer strangle Mr. Banba

182
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,960
and how they retrieved the murder weapon?

183
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,860
Gosh! I've got to solve the case

184
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,860
and get Ai out of here...

185
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,060
as fast as I can.

186
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,790
Inspector Megure.

187
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,690
The pictures of the interior of the cars of all three suspects are ready.

188
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,890
Thank you. Please leave them there.

189
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,190
Yes, sir.

190
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,790
This is it!

191
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,490
Sonoko, did you figure it out?

192
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,390
Maybe all three of them strangled him

193
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,290
before getting off the car.

194
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:44,190
-Or... -Hey.

195
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:48,190
Why don't we go back to where the car is?

196
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,390
We could figure something out.

197
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,590
Inspector.

198
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,190
I guess so.

199
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,090
Like they say, check the scene of the crime out 100 times.

200
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,990
Let's go back.

201
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,590
She's the girl who was wearing the red hood

202
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,290
in the bus that was hi-jacked.

203
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,290
The girl who was lying down in the car.

204
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,390
Don't tell me that...

205
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,890
It can't be.

206
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,990
Shinichi said don't move,

207
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,690
but if I leave Ai as she is...

208
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,990
I've got no choice.

209
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,890
I'll call Dr. Araide once more although he may not be in.

210
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,690
"Araide Clinic" -Yes, this is Dr. Araide.

211
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,390
Dr. Araide?

212
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,690
I take it that you're Dr. Agasa, from your voice?

213
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,490
I'm in luck!

214
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,790
It seems that you weren't in when Conan called.

215
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,690
Conan did? That's strange.

216
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,390
I was home all day today.

217
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,290
What seems to be the matter?

218
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,190
I see.

219
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,590
So, you can't move from there because there's been a murder?

220
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,190
Yes, sort of.

221
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,090
Why don't we do this then?

222
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,490
I'm here at the scene of the crime.

223
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,090
Have you noticed anything?

224
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,990
No, not really.

225
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,890
Why don't you have Sonoko check everyone's car?

226
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,590
Who, me?

227
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,890
You're a great detective,

228
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:23,490
so you may come up with something.

229
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,690
First from Ms. Taiyama's car that's at the very edge.

230
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,890
Will you lend me your key?

231
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,290
Sure.

232
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,190
Here, Sonoko.

233
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,890
Okay.

234
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,790
I can tell that it's an expensive car,

235
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,890
but there seems to be nothing strange about it.

236
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,890
Don't tell me...

237
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,390
Don't tell me Sonoko...

238
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,390
You mean it's come?

239
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,190
Yes. I've figured it all out.

240
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,990
The way Mr. Banba was strangled to death

241
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,890
while sitting in the passenger's seat,

242
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,790
and who did it, too.

243
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,090
Really?

244
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,890
If at all possible,

245
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,990
I wish she'd explain why she's explaining

246
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,890
while pretending to be asleep like Mr. Mouri does.

247
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,990
But have you really figured out the case

248
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,390
when all you did was get into the car and sit down?

249
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,190
I touched it when I sat down.

250
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,690
Touched it?

251
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:27,590
You see that little groove on the top side of the window glass?

252
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:31,090
When my finger touched it, it dawned on me.

253
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:35,090
That Ms. Taiyama, the owner of this Porsche Boxter.

254
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,990
You are the killer.

255
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,990
Hey, hey. Are you serious?

256
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,690
Ms. Taiyama did?

257
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,490
Officer Takagi.

258
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,890
Please sit in the passenger's seat of the Porsche 911 where Mr. Banba's corpse is,

259
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,590
and play the role of the victim.

260
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,390
Okay.

261
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:58,290
Conan, proceed with what I told you earlier.

262
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,790
You mean this fishing line that you told me to go buy?

263
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,190
But can you really do something like that with this?

264
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:08,290
Never mind, just do as I told you to, okay?

265
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,390
Then, everything will become clear.

266
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,890
Okay.

267
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,490
First, hook the fish line around Officer Takagi's neck,

268
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,890
who is sitting down.

269
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:26,190
Then pull the string through behind the head rest.

270
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,290
Get off still holding the string and close the door.

271
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,390
Hold both ends of the string

272
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,990
and pull it through the Porsche 928 that is in between.

273
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,190
Go back to Ms. Taiyama's car

274
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:43,290
and hook it on to the groove on the window of the driver's seat side,

275
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,990
that was made beforehand, and then go back into the car, right?

276
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,590
But the marks left on Mr. Banba's neck

277
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:54,290
showed signs of him being strangled with great strength.

278
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,490
You probably want to say

279
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,390
that the string was pulled secretly from inside the car,

280
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,490
but I don't think it's possible with the strength of a woman.

281
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,790
Right. That's why Ms. Taiyama used...

282
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,390
The strength of the power window.

283
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,390
Ms. Taiyama probably wrapped

284
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,190
the string around the neck of Mr. Banba who was asleep,

285
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,290
like Conan just did.

286
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,390
Then she got off the car,

287
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:22,190
pretended to go get her wallet and got into this car.

288
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,290
She then opened the door

289
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,490
and tied the string pulling it tight,

290
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,190
then tied it onto the transmission lever or something.

291
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,290
All she had left to do was push the switch of the power window

292
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,790
and close the window.

293
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,790
The string would be pulled by the strength of the power window and...

294
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,590
This way, she can choke his neck

295
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,390
even if she's at a distance from him.

296
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,990
Hey, Sonoko!

297
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,890
And since this parking lot is dark to begin with,

298
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,790
it's hard to see the string.

299
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,490
If the key is stopped at the first level,

300
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:02,090
she can move the power window without having to turn on the engine,

301
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,390
so there would be no loud sound.

302
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,690
Okay, I have a question.

303
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:08,290
How did she retrieve the string?

304
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,490
That's easy,

305
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,290
if she uses this radio controlled car.

306
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,590
She leaves the string that is tied beforehand

307
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,390
to the axle of the rear tire

308
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,790
of the radio controlled car outside the box,

309
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,290
cuts the string that had finished strangling his neck,

310
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,890
then ties one end of the string to the string that is outside the box,

311
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,590
and left the radio controlled car running inside the box,

312
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,790
and left the car.

313
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:35,190
It's true that if left that way, the string would automatically rewind.

314
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,590
But if she left the car running,

315
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,490
I would have heard the sound of the motor running

316
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:42,190
when I checked this car.

317
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,790
Oh, don't you know?

318
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:47,490
The battery of a radio controlled car keeps only for about 10 minutes.

319
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,890
By the time you got here, it would've been stopped.

320
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,490
Why don't you try checking out the radio controlled car?

321
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,090
I'm sure you'll find the string wrapped around the axle.

322
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,690
If it's just to roll up the string,

323
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,690
it would be possible to do so using Mr. Hotei's electric reel, too.

324
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:04,790
But I knocked him off the suspect's list because...

325
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,790
Because of the power window.

326
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,990
Out of the three of us,

327
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:15,790
my Boxter's the only one with the power window, right?

328
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,690
I thought I did a pretty good job.

329
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,390
But I didn't think that such a cute detective

330
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,090
would see through my trick.

331
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,990
So, you're the one who killed him after all.

332
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,890
But, why?

333
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,890
Why?

334
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,790
I'm sure that he's thinking so in the world beyond, too.

335
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,790
He's probably wondering, "Why was I killed?"

336
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,890
I'm sure you've heard from him before

337
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,190
that he competed with a yellow Ferrari at a mountain path before?

338
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,090
Come to think of it, yeah, some time in the past.

339
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,390
But he said the driver of the Ferrari picked on him.

340
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,690
That's a lie.

341
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,290
He's the one who picked a fight.

342
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:52,690
I guess all he wanted to do was tease a couple.

343
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,390
But the one driving was my younger brother.

344
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:00,490
After a heated battle, our car went over the cliff.

345
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:05,490
I was saved 3 days later by a person who happened to pass by.

346
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,390
But my younger brother didn't make it.

347
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,890
I couldn't remember the number plate of the man.

348
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,290
But I remembered his face

349
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:17,190
and that his car was a red Porsche 928.

350
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:22,190
I remembered that he had a golf bag in his car.

351
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,190
So, I bought a Porsche

352
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,190
and searched around the golf courses, finally found him

353
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,690
and was waiting for a chance to take revenge.

354
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:34,390
Why didn't you report the incident to the police?

355
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,490
I had no mind of telling the police about it.

356
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,890
Because my younger brother was also at fault

357
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,890
for being provoked into competing.

358
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:43,790
And my purpose for meeting him was not revenge to start with.

359
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,990
What?

360
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:49,490
If that man had called the ambulance right away for us back then,

361
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,690
my brother would've been saved.

362
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,990
I wanted to know why he didn't call the ambulance.

363
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,590
If he said that he was afraid of getting caught

364
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,690
or if he said that he still regrets that day,

365
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,690
I was going to forgive him.

366
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,290
But he continued to play golf after that too,

367
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,790
just as if nothing had happened.

368
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,290
That's when I decided to take revenge.

369
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:15,390
Make sure that all you guys make speed rounds only

370
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,990
with your golfing and never with your cars.

371
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,890
Okay, the case has been solved.

372
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,490
I've got to contact Dr. Agasa right away

373
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,490
and get Ai out of here fast.

374
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,390
Quick, quick, hurry!

375
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,790
Ran, where's Jodie?

376
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,190
She went home

377
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,590
saying she had something urgent to attend to.

378
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,690
What?

379
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,490
Conan!

380
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,490
What?

381
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,090
Dr. Agasa and Ai are both gone!

382
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,990
Don't tell me...

383
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,490
No way!

384
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,690
Oh, I've been waiting for your call.

385
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,190
What do you mean you've been waiting?

386
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,790
I told you not to move and yet why'd you go back home?

387
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,790
You don't have to shout.

388
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,190
This is Dr. Araide's suggestion.

389
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,590
Dr. Araide?

390
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,290
Is he there?

391
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:36,890
Yeah. Ai is being examined now.

392
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,990
You said that he wasn't in,

393
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,090
but when I called him, he was at home.

394
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,690
I told him that we can't seem to move

395
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,790
from where we are since there was a crime,

396
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,790
he said, "The police know who you are, and moreover,

397
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,290
with a sick child, if you ask them to let you out,

398
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,990
I'm sure they'll let you out."

399
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,290
They gave us a lift in the police car and helped us get out.

400
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,290
But just when we got out of the department store,

401
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:00,790
she happened to pass by.

402
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:03,390
Hey. Don't tell me that she's...

403
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:07,090
Hi! I cut a lot of fruit.

404
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,990
Vitamin C is best for colds!

405
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:14,390
She just fell asleep.

406
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,490
Sorry.

407
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,290
Jodie.

408
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,390
She's the one who brought us here.

409
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:25,490
Thank God, she had parked her car in a different parking lot.

410
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,790
It seems that Ai has just come down with a cold,

411
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,190
so there's nothing to worry about.

412
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:34,590
Seven, eight, nine, ten...

413
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,190
Ready or not...

414
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,590
Are you ready?

415
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,790
Here I come.

416
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,690
I'm going to go look for you.

417
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:56,490
I see you.

418
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,490
I've found you.

419
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,260
Next Conan's Hint:

420
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,880
"Ai's older sister, Akemi Miyano"
