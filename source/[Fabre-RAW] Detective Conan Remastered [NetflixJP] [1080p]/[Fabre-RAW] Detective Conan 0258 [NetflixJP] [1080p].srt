1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,390
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,390
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,290
Today's case is a very strange kidnapping.

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,190
Understanding English is very hard.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,590
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,590
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,690
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,450
Boy, what a terrific show!

9
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,450
The animals were so cute.

10
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:35,250
That white lion's act was especially good!

11
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,750
Well, that lion is the star of the show.

12
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,650
Look! That lion's also on this strap.

13
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,450
I really like that!

14
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,850
Cute, isn't it?

15
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,450
Before the show started,

16
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,650
Ai and I saw it at the souvenir shop

17
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,350
-so we both bought one, didn't we? -Yes.

18
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:56,850
Really? I didn't think you liked things like that.

19
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,450
Well, I think it's a whole lot healthier

20
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,750
than someone who reads bloody mysteries

21
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,750
day in and day out without fail.

22
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,950
Don't you think?

23
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,350
Just leave me alone.

24
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,450
Who's that guy surrounded by all those people?

25
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,750
Huh?

26
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,950
He's the man who sponsors the animal show,

27
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,050
that's Randy Hawk.

28
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,650
He's from Oklahoma, a southern state in the United States.

29
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,850
He struck it rich in oil

30
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,150
and he started collecting animals as a hobby,

31
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,750
but then his son Paul and daughter Annie

32
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,150
also became interested in animals

33
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,850
and now they take their animal show all over the world.

34
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,450
That's right! See.

35
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,450
His picture's on the last page of the pamphlet.

36
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,950
Recently, his hobby is travelling around the world with his show

37
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:52,250
and going to the zoo in each country.

38
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,550
According to him, he says,

39
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,450
"We've been cowboys for generations.

40
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,750
We protect it ourselves."

41
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,650
That's why he doesn't take bodyguards with him when he travels.

42
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,650
I heard him say it on television.

43
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,250
He speaks Japanese very well.

44
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,350
Mr. Hawk. Could we have a comment please?

45
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,150
Mr. Hawk...

46
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,650
You've made a mistake! My name isn't Hawk!

47
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,150
Come on, you can't fool us.

48
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:23,650
Is it true that you're donating half the proceeds of your show

49
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,050
to zoos all over the world?

50
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,850
No, I...

51
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,050
You haven't been to Japan in three years, how does it feel?

52
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,450
Please say something, Mr. Hawk.

53
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,450
Mr. Hawk...

54
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,650
Over here, Mr. Hawk!

55
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:39,750
I can't give answers to all your questions at the same time!

56
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:51,850
"The Man From Chicago (Part 1)"

57
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,450
Oh my.

58
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:00,050
He doesn't look anything like a tough cowboy now.

59
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,550
He's quite lucky.

60
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,850
I have to hide and look behind my shoulder all the time

61
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,950
because I can't afford a bodyguard.

62
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,850
He brought this upon himself.

63
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,250
Come on. Don't be like that. Let's go help him out.

64
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,050
That cowboy looks like he was raised in high society

65
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,550
and surrounded by a herd of cows, he doesn't know what to do.

66
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,350
Listen. I've been trying to tell you that I...

67
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,650
There you are, Uncle Thomas!

68
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,050
-Huh? -Uncle Thomas?

69
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,250
He's not Mr. Hawk?

70
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,850
No. He's a friend of my grandfather's.

71
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,750
He's an English teacher.

72
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,350
Yes, that's right.

73
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,050
Come on, let's go, Uncle Thomas.

74
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,750
You promised we were all going to have lunch at a restaurant.

75
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,650
Come on, hurry!

76
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,100
Thank you very much.

77
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,100
You kids were a big help!

78
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,700
I get mistaken for Mr. Hawk a lot

79
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,300
but I've never been in that kind of situation before.

80
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,100
Then you should disguise yourself when you go out.

81
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,700
That would just make things worse.

82
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,100
Do you like Paul and Annie's animal show that much?

83
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,800
Yes! Their show is the best!

84
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,200
And besides...

85
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,400
I wanted this so badly.

86
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,700
That's why I came all the way to Japan.

87
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,400
Oh, we bought that one too!

88
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,700
But that strap's popular around the world, it's sold everywhere.

89
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,300
You didn't have to come to Japan for it.

90
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,900
No, no. Look at the back of the strap.

91
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,000
It says "In Japan", doesn't it?

92
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,600
This is the only place you can get it.

93
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,900
I see. So it's a collector's item.

94
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,900
However, that incident back there was very, very unfortunate.

95
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,200
I didn't get to meet my friend.

96
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,700
We were supposed to meet after the show.

97
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,700
Did you happen to see a man with long hair?

98
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:19,200
I don't think so. After all, that place was packed.

99
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,100
And you're very astute.

100
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,100
How did you know he wasn't Mr. Hawk?

101
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,700
It's the way he talked.

102
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,500
The way he talked?

103
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,700
What?

104
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,000
Mister, back there

105
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,200
you pronounced the word "can't" as "count", didn't you?

106
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,900
That's the Queen English.

107
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,800
If you came from a long line of cowboys,

108
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,700
then there's no way a man from the South

109
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,400
would have an English accent.

110
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,700
It just seemed unnatural.

111
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,900
Now that you mention it, the Mr. Hawk I saw on TV

112
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,500
had a strong Southern draw and spoke rather loudly.

113
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,200
I looked at the picture in the pamphlet very carefully

114
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
and saw it was completely different.

115
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,600
But then, I don't blame the Japanese reporters

116
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,400
for making that mistake.

117
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,400
Like Westerners can't tell one Oriental from the other,

118
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,700
we Orientals can't tell one Westerner from another

119
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,500
if they have the same hair and skin coloring.

120
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,800
How perceptive of you!

121
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,400
My name is James Black.

122
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,800
What's yours?

123
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,500
Conan Edogawa.

124
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,400
I'm a private investigator.

125
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,800
Conan Edogawa?

126
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,300
Private investigator?

127
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,800
Conan's not the only one.

128
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,600
We all belong to the same group.

129
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,700
That's right.

130
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,900
See!

131
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,400
Sherlock Holmes!

132
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,400
Then you kids must be the Baker Street Irregulars.

133
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,000
Baker Street...

134
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,900
Holmes used some kids who lived on Baker Street

135
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,000
to gather information for him, that's what they were called.

136
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,600
I see.

137
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,200
I was born on Baker Street.

138
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,300
I know!

139
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,400
Let's have a celebration in honor of my meeting up

140
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
with the Baker Street Irregulars.

141
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,700
I'll treat you to a superb lunch at a great restaurant I know.

142
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,200
Did you come by car?

143
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,900
Yes. But there's so many people,

144
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,800
I don't think there's room for you.

145
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,400
No problem! We'll use the van I rented.

146
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,900
I'll bring it around. Please wait here.

147
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:39,000
But unlike lunch, my driving isn't very good.

148
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You'll have to drive!

149
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,800
Huh?

150
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,700
Driving cars with the handles on the right is most difficult.

151
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,300
Mister. What do you mean you can't drive right handed cars?

152
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,300
Does that mean you're not living in England now?

153
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,900
Oh, yes.

154
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,300
I was born in London,

155
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,300
but I was raised in Chicago.

156
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,000
The windy city where Al Capone stormed.

157
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,100
Hey.

158
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,200
Don't you feel something about that guy?

159
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,100
Huh?

160
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,200
No, not really.

161
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,200
I see. I guess it's all right then.

162
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,500
Excuse me, sir.

163
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,300
We're with the police.

164
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,900
Is this your car?

165
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,600
Yes.

166
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,200
This is the car I'm renting.

167
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,100
I see. Actually, this is a stolen vehicle.

168
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,200
Oh, no!

169
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,200
It was reported stolen a week ago.

170
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,100
Could you tell us where you rented it and give us the details?

171
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,900
We'd also like your name

172
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,500
and the name of the hotel you're staying at.

173
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,400
Rather than stand here in the middle of the street,

174
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,800
why don't we go to the police car on the other side of the alley?

175
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,600
Do you mind?

176
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,400
We won't take up too much of your time.

177
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,800
What's the matter?

178
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,900
Please get in.

179
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,700
I just remembered I have friends waiting for me.

180
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,700
May I go and tell them I'll be late?

181
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,900
Get in.

182
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,000
What?

183
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,200
Shut up and get in the car!

184
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,000
-What is it? -The guy dropped something.

185
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,800
It's just a strap.

186
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,600
-Okay! Let's get going. -All right.

187
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Ouch!

188
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Look what you did. I cut my finger.

189
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,100
Good grief. What a bother.

190
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,400
You men...

191
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,300
You're not really police officers, are you?

192
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,400
Be quiet!

193
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,400
You're just a cowboy wannabe that come into a lot of money.

194
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,300
No, you're wrong! I... I'm not...

195
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,400
You made your money by whipping poor defenseless animals.

196
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,300
We just want you to share it with us.

197
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,060
That's strange.

198
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,760
40 minutes have gone by already.

199
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,560
He's so late.

200
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,560
I wonder what he's doing.

201
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,160
I'm so hungry.

202
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,060
Come on, Dr. Agasa can wait here,

203
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,560
the rest of us will go check on him.

204
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,960
Good idea.

205
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,460
There aren't that many parking lots around here in walking distance.

206
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,060
Ai, come with us!

207
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,460
Okay.

208
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,760
I wonder if this is the place.

209
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,260
Mr. Black...

210
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,460
Hey, are you in here?

211
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,060
Oh? We're not looking for cats.

212
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,160
Mr. Black!

213
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,560
I found it! I'm sure this is it!

214
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,560
This is his car.

215
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,860
See? There's a stuffed lion by the driver's seat.

216
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,560
But there's nobody inside.

217
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,260
The door was left open.

218
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,860
The key are still inside.

219
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,560
Hey, you guys! Are you looking for somebody?

220
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,260
If it's the foreigner with the beard,

221
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,060
he was going to get inside the car

222
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,660
but went that way with two guys wearing coats!

223
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,860
Huh?

224
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,110
Hey, Conan!

225
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,910
-Conan! -What's the matter?

226
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,110
Hey! Did you find him?

227
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,610
Conan?

228
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,910
It's a lion strap, isn't it?

229
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,710
I wonder if it's Mr. Black's.

230
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:46,010
If it is, this is where he probably got into another car.

231
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:52,610
He did say he was supposed to meet a friend, didn't he?

232
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:57,310
Hey, do you think that guy forgot all about us

233
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,910
and went to go eat with his friend?

234
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,310
What? I don't believe it.

235
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,410
No, I don't think he forgot.

236
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,910
Huh?

237
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:11,610
Most likely... He got himself mixed up in something.

238
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,710
See! Look at this strap.

239
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:26,210
The P and A have been smeared with blood.

240
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:31,510
Maybe he was trying to leave us a message

241
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,610
because he thought we might come to look for him.

242
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,310
Don't you think so?

243
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,410
What?

244
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,810
That's terrible!

245
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:42,510
-We've got to call police! -She's right!

246
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,910
But, why?

247
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,410
I don't get it. Why the P and A?

248
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,210
It was so easy!

249
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:58,010
Now all we've got to do is

250
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,310
to see how much this moneybag's son and daughter

251
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,010
will dish out for him.

252
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,110
I'm thinking 5 million at least.

253
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:08,810
After all, this guy has so much money to spare

254
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,110
he gives it away to all kinds of zoos.

255
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,710
Well, we can thank you

256
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,710
for fixing this car up to look like a real cop car.

257
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,710
Mr. Hawk here, who thinks he's some tough cowboy

258
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,710
and wonders around without a bodyguard to protect him...

259
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,410
No! You've made a mistake! I'm not Hawk!

260
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,210
My name's James Black! You've got the wrong man!

261
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,710
James?

262
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:43,110
First a cowboy, now you're an English secret agent?

263
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,110
No, no!

264
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,610
You mean James Bond!

265
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:52,310
Never mind. That's not important.

266
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,410
I just want you to keep your mouth shut

267
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,010
until we get to our hideout.

268
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,110
Mr. 007.

269
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:11,810
Just you watch...

270
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,510
how we snatch the ransom.

271
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,410
Our plan's beautiful.

272
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,710
No, I don't want to see...

273
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,410
how you play out your plan.

274
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,410
-What? -Pay attention!

275
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,810
I've been trying to explain!

276
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,410
He's a foreigner and he has glasses and beard.

277
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:51,010
He's teen involved in some accident or something!

278
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:54,510
He might have been kidnapped or something.

279
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,210
But boys,

280
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:02,510
you didn't actually see him being kidnapped, did you?

281
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,510
Besides, there are a lot of foreigners with beards and glasses.

282
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,210
We wouldn't know where to begin.

283
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:12,010
It would be easier if you had a picture or something.

284
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,610
I've got a picture!

285
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,610
If you need a picture! Here!

286
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,210
This is how he looks.

287
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,110
This is Randy Hawk.

288
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,010
If this is the guy, he's safe.

289
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:27,110
I just heard him talking on the radio.

290
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,610
No, you don't understand!

291
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:32,610
James Black looks just like Randy Hawk.

292
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,110
Huh?

293
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,910
Listen. Was that radio program a live broadcast?

294
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,710
Yes, that's right. I think he's still on.

295
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,510
Yes, more than likely.

296
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,310
That's not good.

297
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:50,910
if the men kidnapped Mr. Black thinking he was Randy Hawk,

298
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:54,010
they'd probably listen to the radio program

299
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,810
he was supposed to be on, wouldn't they?

300
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:59,110
Oh, no! Then they're bound to find out the truth.

301
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:03,410
Yes, after they find out they've got the wrong man,

302
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:07,310
they'll probably kill him.

303
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,610
Hey! What is this?

304
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,910
And I'd like all of you to continue supporting Paul and Annie.

305
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:16,410
and of course, me, Randy Hawk.

306
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,610
Why Randy Hawk on a live radio show?

307
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,810
Then, who the heck are you?

308
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,110
That's what I've been trying to tell you

309
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,310
you've got the wrong person!

310
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:32,210
Gosh! Now what!

311
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,510
Hey! What're we going to do?

312
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,610
The guy's seen our faces!

313
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:43,310
All we gotta do is kill him! That's all!

314
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,810
Don't do it!

315
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,910
What do you intend to do, drive all over town

316
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:50,210
with a bloody corpse in the car?

317
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:54,010
We'll blow his brains out like we planned

318
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,210
when we got to the mountains in Gunma.

319
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:00,210
And after his grave's been dug,

320
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:03,710
we'll figure out another plan. Okay?

321
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,310
No big deal. We'll just do like we planned.

322
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,610
We won't get caught.

323
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:16,010
The cops have no idea who we are.

324
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,910
And besides, they wouldn't have a clue

325
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:24,010
as to why some foreigner would get kidnapped.

326
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,920
Next Conan's Hint:

327
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,220
"P and A"

328
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,060
Next Conan is the man from Chicago, part two.

329
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,520
Part two, eh?
