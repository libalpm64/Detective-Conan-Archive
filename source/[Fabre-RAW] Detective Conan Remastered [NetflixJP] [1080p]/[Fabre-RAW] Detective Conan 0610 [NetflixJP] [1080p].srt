"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:05,985
Stay away!

3
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:11,701
Hey! Why is that dog glowing?

4
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:12,901
It's a demon dog!

5
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:15,101
Demon dogs really do exists!

6
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:16,901
It's just "phosphorus".

7
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:19,301
Phosphorus has the property

8
00:00:19,301 --> 00:00:23,801
to emit a bluish-white glow upon exposure to oxygen, you know.

9
00:00:23,801 --> 00:00:26,401
They just painted the dog with it to make it glow

10
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,601
and frighten people.

11
00:00:28,601 --> 00:00:31,301
Geez, don't go spoil the ending for us like that.

12
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:34,013
But since Sherlock Holmes' "The Hound of the Baskervilles"

13
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:36,901
is so well known, I thought you knew that.

14
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:40,019
Now look here. Unlike Conan and Shinichi,

15
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:43,301
we aren't Sherlock Holmes' geeks.

16
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:46,025
Now that we know the demon dog's a fake,

17
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:48,301
I guess I'll watch another channel.

18
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:49,301
In that case,

19
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:52,031
how about joining us on a real demon dog hunt?

20
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:57,301
Hattori and Kazuha!

21
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:00,039
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

22
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:02,601
Tears are the start of all dramas.

23
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:04,501
The story with an unexpected twist.

24
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:06,501
Is the victim Shinichi Kudo?

25
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:08,047
He sees through the one and only truth.

26
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:10,049
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

27
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,701
His name is Detective Conan!

28
00:02:54,153 --> 00:02:56,794
"The Victim is Shinichi Kudo".

29
00:02:59,394 --> 00:03:02,994
"Mouri Detective Agency" -We did ring the bell,

30
00:03:02,994 --> 00:03:06,165
but you didn't answer and we heard screaming.

31
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:08,894
Also your front door was unlocked.

32
00:03:08,894 --> 00:03:10,194
But even so,

33
00:03:10,194 --> 00:03:12,994
that's not a reason for you to just barge in like that.

34
00:03:12,994 --> 00:03:15,794
Anyway, what did you mean when you said "demon dog"?

35
00:03:15,794 --> 00:03:18,177
Oh, it's just a silly made-up story!

36
00:03:18,394 --> 00:03:20,179
Well, I wouldn't be too sure about that yet.

37
00:03:20,394 --> 00:03:22,994
Do you know that about five years ago,

38
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:26,994
an extremely rich elderly man named Tsunechika Inubuchi passed away?

39
00:03:26,994 --> 00:03:28,187
Yeah.

40
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:32,594
Wasn't he the president of the Inubushi Group?

41
00:03:32,594 --> 00:03:35,494
Is it possible that this president was killed by the demon dog?

42
00:03:35,494 --> 00:03:38,197
No, no. He just died of an illness.

43
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:39,694
He apparently had terminal cancer.

44
00:03:39,694 --> 00:03:41,794
Nevertheless, about that president...

45
00:03:41,794 --> 00:03:43,294
It is said that he was wild

46
00:03:43,294 --> 00:03:45,994
and quite a ladies man when he was young.

47
00:03:45,994 --> 00:03:47,994
In fact, in the days after he died,

48
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,594
his estate was visited by people claiming

49
00:03:50,594 --> 00:03:54,894
"I am connected to the president by blood".

50
00:03:54,894 --> 00:03:55,894
Illegitimate children?

51
00:03:55,894 --> 00:03:58,494
Yes, and each one of them

52
00:03:58,494 --> 00:04:01,594
carried a picture of the president with their mother.

53
00:04:01,594 --> 00:04:02,994
Geez.

54
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:05,394
Wouldn't something like that just be a lie in order to get inheritance?

55
00:04:05,394 --> 00:04:06,994
You're absolutely right.

56
00:04:06,994 --> 00:04:08,227
But even if they wanted to confirm it,

57
00:04:08,394 --> 00:04:10,494
the old man himself is already gone.

58
00:04:10,494 --> 00:04:14,233
And since they each said that their own mother died as well,

59
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:16,594
they couldn't learn about the romance.

60
00:04:16,594 --> 00:04:19,194
Normally, they'd be turned away at this point.

61
00:04:19,194 --> 00:04:22,241
But the president's wife, Satomi,

62
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:26,694
accepted them all as her adopted children.

63
00:04:26,694 --> 00:04:28,247
All eight of them!

64
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:29,794
Eight of them?

65
00:04:29,794 --> 00:04:33,794
And now that the wife has been struck with illness,

66
00:04:33,794 --> 00:04:36,255
the case begins.

67
00:04:36,494 --> 00:04:38,257
Fight over inheritance...

68
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:39,194
Yeah.

69
00:04:39,194 --> 00:04:42,261
The huge inheritance the wife received from the president,

70
00:04:42,494 --> 00:04:44,263
which was to be divided

71
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:47,494
amongst the eight adopted children upon her death.

72
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:51,994
But two of the children have since died in bizarre ways.

73
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:54,294
One of them fell from a cliff

74
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,394
and just before dying said that

75
00:04:57,394 --> 00:05:01,894
what pushed him was a kind of monster,

76
00:05:01,894 --> 00:05:03,594
whose body was engulfed in crimson flames

77
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:06,294
that grew bigger and bigger as it attacked.

78
00:05:06,294 --> 00:05:09,194
An apparition that strongly resembled a dog.

79
00:05:09,194 --> 00:05:10,994
What?

80
00:05:12,694 --> 00:05:15,094
It was probably just someone who set a plastic doll on fire

81
00:05:15,094 --> 00:05:16,894
and closed in after him.

82
00:05:16,894 --> 00:05:18,297
However,

83
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:22,894
that guy, he fled from the dog by bike for as far as one kilometre.

84
00:05:22,894 --> 00:05:24,894
He would've noticed it's a fake, wouldn't he?

85
00:05:24,894 --> 00:05:26,694
Then, were you, Heiji,

86
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:29,594
contacted by that Inubushi family?

87
00:05:29,594 --> 00:05:31,994
No, it happens that one of the adopted children

88
00:05:31,994 --> 00:05:34,694
is an acquaintance of Kazuha's mother.

89
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:37,094
I heard that they were elementary schoolmates.

90
00:05:37,094 --> 00:05:39,694
He said he used to live in Kansai (western part of Japan).

91
00:05:39,694 --> 00:05:42,994
And he said the two people who died

92
00:05:42,994 --> 00:05:45,594
were killed by a curse.

93
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:47,294
A... a curse?

94
00:05:47,294 --> 00:05:49,894
According to him, one of the eight children

95
00:05:49,894 --> 00:05:53,994
is an imposter who holds a grudge against the Inubushi family.

96
00:05:53,994 --> 00:05:55,894
And plans to use a cursed demon dog

97
00:05:55,894 --> 00:05:59,994
to root out all those with Inubushi blood!

98
00:05:59,994 --> 00:06:01,194
Root out?

99
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:05,194
In fact, it was my dad, the chief detective with the Osaka Police,

100
00:06:05,194 --> 00:06:07,594
who he really wanted to consult with.

101
00:06:07,594 --> 00:06:09,794
But there's no way my dad can leave Osaka.

102
00:06:09,794 --> 00:06:10,794
Having no choice,

103
00:06:10,794 --> 00:06:13,394
he asked if someone could at least come and listen to his story.

104
00:06:13,394 --> 00:06:15,794
That's where I step in.

105
00:06:15,794 --> 00:06:17,194
But all in all,

106
00:06:17,194 --> 00:06:19,594
you still need to go to that Inubushi house, no?

107
00:06:19,594 --> 00:06:23,194
Nah, it seems he gave up all claim to the inheritance

108
00:06:23,194 --> 00:06:25,394
and left the Inubushi family.

109
00:06:25,394 --> 00:06:27,994
He has since changed his name

110
00:06:27,994 --> 00:06:30,369
and lives here in Tokyo.

111
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:32,994
I'm going to go listen to his story tomorrow.

112
00:06:32,994 --> 00:06:34,694
You guys want to come?

113
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,375
What?

114
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:40,379
Actually, that guy has a very funny name.

115
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:45,794
"Shinichi Kudo" -Shinichi Kudo?

116
00:06:45,794 --> 00:06:47,194
No kidding.

117
00:06:47,194 --> 00:06:49,694
See, isn't it hilarious?

118
00:06:49,694 --> 00:06:51,594
Not funny.

119
00:06:51,594 --> 00:06:54,393
Who may I ask is calling?

120
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:57,094
The detective who was summoned by Mr. Shinnichi Kudo.

121
00:06:57,094 --> 00:07:00,694
That was a woman's voice just now, right?

122
00:07:00,694 --> 00:07:03,394
But doesn't that person live alone?

123
00:07:03,394 --> 00:07:05,894
He has a bad back, so he has a helper

124
00:07:05,894 --> 00:07:08,194
who comes to look after him two to three times a week.

125
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:11,394
It seems he can't even go to work at his company now.

126
00:07:13,294 --> 00:07:15,594
"Funae Abukawa (39)" -Well...

127
00:07:15,594 --> 00:07:17,994
"Homehelper" -Mr. Kudo is sleeping right now.

128
00:07:22,694 --> 00:07:25,894
Mr. Kudo, you have visitors.

129
00:07:29,794 --> 00:07:31,994
Sound asleep, huh?

130
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:34,094
But isn't this room a bit too warm?

131
00:07:34,094 --> 00:07:36,894
Yeah. He might have a slight cold.

132
00:07:36,894 --> 00:07:40,439
"Shinichi Kudo (43)" -Also, he said he didn't sleep much at all last night

133
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:42,994
"Adopted heir of Inubushi" -because he stayed up doing a lot of thinking.

134
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:45,894
But he should wake up soon.

135
00:07:45,894 --> 00:07:46,994
Then, if you don't mind,

136
00:07:46,994 --> 00:07:49,194
we'll wait here until he does.

137
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:55,094
I'd be grateful if you would listen to what he has to say.

138
00:07:55,094 --> 00:07:57,694
I don't think I can handle it anymore.

139
00:08:00,194 --> 00:08:02,461
He'd rather die now and be at peace?

140
00:08:02,694 --> 00:08:04,463
Did he really say that?

141
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:05,894
Yes.

142
00:08:05,894 --> 00:08:09,294
He said that if he were going to be eaten by accursed demon dog...

143
00:08:09,294 --> 00:08:11,094
That man may have seen it as well,

144
00:08:11,094 --> 00:08:12,994
I mean the dog.

145
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:14,473
I guess so.

146
00:08:15,894 --> 00:08:19,294
All right now, I'm going to go buy groceries for dinner.

147
00:08:19,294 --> 00:08:21,394
Could you two watch the house for me?

148
00:08:21,394 --> 00:08:23,494
Sure, no problem.

149
00:08:25,594 --> 00:08:27,694
A cursed demon dog, huh?

150
00:08:27,694 --> 00:08:31,294
Hey, did you hear anything else about the case?

151
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:32,294
Yeah.

152
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:35,294
I heard about the names of those eight adopted children.

153
00:08:36,494 --> 00:08:39,194
Well, the pronunciations are

154
00:08:39,194 --> 00:08:43,994
Shinichi, Takako, Saki, Tomoaki,

155
00:08:43,994 --> 00:08:48,294
Miwako, Yoshiya, Keiji and Miyuki.

156
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:51,094
It seems they were all named

157
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:54,513
by president Tsunechika Inubushi who died five years ago.

158
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:57,894
And, who were the two people that died?

159
00:08:57,894 --> 00:09:00,519
Well, if I recall...

160
00:09:04,094 --> 00:09:06,094
What's that sound?

161
00:09:06,094 --> 00:09:10,094
I think he may have set an alarm clock to play music.

162
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:16,535
This... this door...

163
00:09:16,694 --> 00:09:18,294
It's been sealed with packing tape!

164
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:32,551
-Suicide by charcoal poisoning? -Looks like it.

165
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:33,994
I'll take care of the taped window.

166
00:09:33,994 --> 00:09:35,594
And I'll get the clay stove out.

167
00:09:42,094 --> 00:09:44,563
Darn, this is stuck on really tight!

168
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:46,094
Didn't you say he had back pain?

169
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:49,594
Even made a kind of footstool out of a pile of books.

170
00:09:51,894 --> 00:09:54,294
Wait a minute, this charcoal stove is...

171
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:57,994
What... what's going on here?

172
00:09:59,194 --> 00:10:00,994
It's carbon monoxide poisoning!

173
00:10:00,994 --> 00:10:02,581
Don't move!

174
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:03,994
You can't come inside!

175
00:10:12,794 --> 00:10:16,994
We first came to this room about 30 minutes ago, right?

176
00:10:16,994 --> 00:10:18,094
Yeah.

177
00:10:19,394 --> 00:10:21,294
His jaw has started to stiffen.

178
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:25,294
His back is showing signs of slight rigor mortis.

179
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:28,607
And, this charcoal stove...

180
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:33,394
Not to mention that stack of books used as a footstool...

181
00:10:33,394 --> 00:10:35,894
-It's obvious. -Yeah.

182
00:10:35,894 --> 00:10:40,094
Anyway, I should go and call the police.

183
00:10:40,094 --> 00:10:41,994
Before you do that,

184
00:10:41,994 --> 00:10:44,994
we need to ask you something.

185
00:10:44,994 --> 00:10:45,994
What?

186
00:10:45,994 --> 00:10:48,627
Why did you kill that man?

187
00:10:50,394 --> 00:10:54,094
-Why? -That's our question.

188
00:10:54,094 --> 00:10:58,637
And if you're thinking of telling us it was the demon dog's curse...

189
00:10:58,637 --> 00:11:00,639
You won't fool us.

190
00:11:06,363 --> 00:11:08,647
Wait... wait just a moment!

191
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:11,363
Why would I be the culprit?

192
00:11:11,363 --> 00:11:13,363
I'm just an ordinary homehelper.

193
00:11:13,363 --> 00:11:16,655
Anyway, I only just returned from shopping.

194
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:19,863
Plus, it looks as if this door

195
00:11:19,863 --> 00:11:22,363
was sealed with masking tape.

196
00:11:22,363 --> 00:11:23,863
And when I got here,

197
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:27,163
you were tearing the masking tape off of the window, right?

198
00:11:27,163 --> 00:11:30,163
Yeah. It was stuck on there real good.

199
00:11:30,163 --> 00:11:31,363
Not to mention

200
00:11:31,363 --> 00:11:34,463
the fact that a charcoal stove was next to the body.

201
00:11:34,463 --> 00:11:37,363
So, no matter how you look at it,

202
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,663
it must be suicide by charcoal poisoning!

203
00:11:40,663 --> 00:11:43,063
That may be so.

204
00:11:43,063 --> 00:11:44,963
Both the entry door and the window

205
00:11:44,963 --> 00:11:47,363
were sealed from inside,

206
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:49,263
making it a perfectly sealed-room.

207
00:11:49,263 --> 00:11:53,963
And it'd be impossible for anyone else

208
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,695
to be in the room.

209
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:58,363
In that case...

210
00:11:58,363 --> 00:12:01,563
However, it is strange.

211
00:12:01,563 --> 00:12:04,263
Despite Shinichi having a bad back,

212
00:12:04,263 --> 00:12:05,763
there's a footstool made from books

213
00:12:05,763 --> 00:12:08,707
in the lower part of the shelf.

214
00:12:08,863 --> 00:12:10,709
Do you think someone with a bad back

215
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:13,463
would've deliberately bent over

216
00:12:13,463 --> 00:12:15,863
to take books from the lower shelf?

217
00:12:15,863 --> 00:12:19,363
Perhaps the books on the shelves he could easily reach

218
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:22,463
were ones he didn't want to step on?

219
00:12:22,463 --> 00:12:24,063
That's why he strained himself to.

220
00:12:24,063 --> 00:12:25,563
Not to mention this charcoal stove...

221
00:12:25,563 --> 00:12:28,363
It isn't hot even though I hold it in my bare hand.

222
00:12:28,363 --> 00:12:30,363
You may not know this, little boy,

223
00:12:30,363 --> 00:12:31,463
but charcoal is...

224
00:12:31,463 --> 00:12:34,733
If you burn charcoal in an airtight room,

225
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:36,735
the oxygen in the air will be exhausted,

226
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,737
causing incomplete combustion

227
00:12:38,963 --> 00:12:41,663
and carbon monoxide is generated.

228
00:12:41,663 --> 00:12:42,741
If inhaled,

229
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:45,463
carbon monoxide will introduce itself to the bloodstream,

230
00:12:45,463 --> 00:12:48,263
combine with the haemoglobin and lead to asphyxiation

231
00:12:48,263 --> 00:12:49,763
followed by death.

232
00:12:49,763 --> 00:12:50,749
With that said,

233
00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:53,563
did you want to say that when the oxygen was finally used up,

234
00:12:53,563 --> 00:12:57,863
the flame on the charcoal went out?

235
00:12:57,863 --> 00:12:59,863
Yeah.

236
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:05,263
Well, it would've been extremely painful if it failed,

237
00:13:05,263 --> 00:13:07,763
followed by serious after-effects.

238
00:13:07,763 --> 00:13:10,063
But it was about 30 minutes ago

239
00:13:10,063 --> 00:13:13,463
that we last saw this man sleeping in this room.

240
00:13:13,463 --> 00:13:16,263
If he then sealed the door and the window,

241
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:18,763
wouldn't it take more than ten minutes?

242
00:13:18,763 --> 00:13:21,063
It would take even longer

243
00:13:21,063 --> 00:13:22,781
if he took it slow with his bad back!

244
00:13:22,963 --> 00:13:24,783
It would take quite a while

245
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:27,963
for a single clay stove to fill the room with carbon monoxide

246
00:13:27,963 --> 00:13:32,063
and the remaining time wouldn't be sufficient.

247
00:13:32,063 --> 00:13:33,963
And even if the fire went out,

248
00:13:33,963 --> 00:13:35,963
it should still retain some heat.

249
00:13:35,963 --> 00:13:38,797
In short, this charcoal

250
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:42,363
has already been burned and left cold for quite a while.

251
00:13:44,963 --> 00:13:46,563
And that means that

252
00:13:46,563 --> 00:13:50,809
what was placed in the stove was just cold charcoal.

253
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:52,563
It also means that someone else could've been in this room

254
00:13:52,563 --> 00:13:56,063
to seal the windows and the door with masking tape.

255
00:13:57,163 --> 00:14:00,819
Ridiculous! Are you saying I was in the room?

256
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:03,663
If so, you would've seen me, wouldn't you?

257
00:14:03,663 --> 00:14:06,363
But I wasn't here.

258
00:14:06,363 --> 00:14:08,827
You were holding your breath hiding, weren't you?

259
00:14:09,063 --> 00:14:11,863
In the space between this bookshelf and behind the door.

260
00:14:14,363 --> 00:14:16,563
It was a well-thought-out plan you made.

261
00:14:17,763 --> 00:14:19,963
If we saw the door and the window all taped up

262
00:14:19,963 --> 00:14:21,563
and a charcoal stove on the floor,

263
00:14:21,563 --> 00:14:23,963
we'd think it was a charcoal-burning suicide.

264
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,563
And our attention would've been directed

265
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:28,263
to those instead of to the door.

266
00:14:28,263 --> 00:14:31,563
Enabling you to safely hide behind the door.

267
00:14:31,563 --> 00:14:34,863
And, just as we were about to remove the tape on the window

268
00:14:34,863 --> 00:14:37,963
and the stove from the room,

269
00:14:37,963 --> 00:14:41,663
you took the chance to sneak out to the doorway.

270
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,563
You attempted to raise the room temperature

271
00:14:43,563 --> 00:14:46,863
in order to slow the body temperature's drop rate,

272
00:14:46,863 --> 00:14:48,867
but since his jaw has already begun to stiffen,

273
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:51,763
more than an hour would've passed since his death.

274
00:14:51,763 --> 00:14:54,563
His back also showed slight rigor mortis.

275
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:56,363
That's proof

276
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,563
that you laid the deceased old man on this bed

277
00:14:58,563 --> 00:15:01,163
to make it appear as if he is sleeping.

278
00:15:02,063 --> 00:15:03,763
Well, talk about evidence,

279
00:15:03,763 --> 00:15:07,263
her fingerprints should still be on the duct tape, shouldn't they?

280
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,263
That's right.

281
00:15:08,263 --> 00:15:10,889
Since you had to apply a very sticky masking tape,

282
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:14,463
it would take more time if you had been wearing gloves.

283
00:15:14,463 --> 00:15:17,163
I bet you planned on taking the tape down with us,

284
00:15:17,163 --> 00:15:18,663
and trying to trick us by saying

285
00:15:18,663 --> 00:15:21,363
that's how your prints got on the tape.

286
00:15:21,363 --> 00:15:23,363
But your plan is ruined, isn't it?

287
00:15:23,363 --> 00:15:25,463
What... what is this?

288
00:15:25,463 --> 00:15:28,263
Who on earth are you?

289
00:15:28,263 --> 00:15:31,863
Didn't we tell you when we rang the bell to this house?

290
00:15:33,263 --> 00:15:34,663
That we're detectives!

291
00:15:34,663 --> 00:15:36,663
This... this is wrong.

292
00:15:36,663 --> 00:15:38,163
This is not what I was told!

293
00:15:38,163 --> 00:15:39,363
What's that?

294
00:15:39,363 --> 00:15:41,563
From what I heard

295
00:15:41,563 --> 00:15:46,063
it was only a child detective who was coming.

296
00:15:46,063 --> 00:15:48,263
"It was only a child, so it's no big deal."

297
00:15:48,263 --> 00:15:50,929
Did this man tell you something like that?

298
00:15:52,463 --> 00:15:53,863
It's the culprit!

299
00:15:53,863 --> 00:15:54,933
It was the culprit who said

300
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,663
that everything would be fine if I followed the instructions,

301
00:15:57,663 --> 00:16:00,163
because I'd be dealing with a child!

302
00:16:00,163 --> 00:16:01,663
What now?

303
00:16:01,663 --> 00:16:02,941
Look, lady.

304
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:03,863
If you keep spewing nonsense,

305
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:04,943
I'll teach you a lesson!

306
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:06,263
I'm not lying!

307
00:16:06,263 --> 00:16:08,947
Because when I came here today,

308
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:11,963
Mr. Kudo was already dead.

309
00:16:11,963 --> 00:16:13,963
What do you mean?

310
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:16,955
I came in the afternoon as I usually do...

311
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:19,963
But when I rang the doorbell, no one answered.

312
00:16:19,963 --> 00:16:20,959
I had no choice

313
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,961
but to enter using the spare key I was given,

314
00:16:23,163 --> 00:16:26,163
and the phone had been ringing.

315
00:16:27,163 --> 00:16:28,463
When I answered,

316
00:16:28,463 --> 00:16:31,363
the caller told me in an eerie, machine-modified voice.

317
00:16:31,363 --> 00:16:34,963
"I have shut Kudo up inside his bedroom wardrobe.

318
00:16:34,963 --> 00:16:36,163
If you want to save him,

319
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:39,263
you'd better hurry", they said.

320
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:40,979
The wardrobe?

321
00:16:41,163 --> 00:16:42,363
This thing.

322
00:16:42,363 --> 00:16:45,963
I came to this room half-unconvinced.

323
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,987
The wardrobe had indeed been sealed up with masking tape.

324
00:16:48,987 --> 00:16:51,263
And a bar had been shoved through the handles

325
00:16:51,263 --> 00:16:54,163
so it couldn't be opened from inside.

326
00:16:54,163 --> 00:16:57,963
Soon after I removed it and opened the door,

327
00:16:57,963 --> 00:17:00,563
I found Mr. Kudo was inside.

328
00:17:00,563 --> 00:17:03,001
The edges of the door are sticky.

329
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:03,963
Yeah.

330
00:17:03,963 --> 00:17:05,563
It seems they drugged him to sleep

331
00:17:05,563 --> 00:17:08,663
and killed him by locking him up in there

332
00:17:08,663 --> 00:17:10,763
with the burning charcoal grill.

333
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,763
You... you understand, right?

334
00:17:12,763 --> 00:17:15,363
That what I'm saying is the truth.

335
00:17:15,363 --> 00:17:20,463
Yeah, this was indeed the true scene of the crime.

336
00:17:20,463 --> 00:17:22,363
However,

337
00:17:22,363 --> 00:17:23,863
if that was true,

338
00:17:23,863 --> 00:17:26,763
why didn't you call the police?

339
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:29,027
If you did something this unwise and were discovered,

340
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:32,563
you knew that the consequences would be irreversible.

341
00:17:32,563 --> 00:17:35,033
Because...

342
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,163
because of what was stuck to the inside of the wardrobe door!

343
00:17:38,163 --> 00:17:40,563
A picture of my son!

344
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:45,043
He said over the phone that if I didn't do what I was told,

345
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:47,463
my son would meet the same fate.

346
00:17:47,463 --> 00:17:49,047
And you took them seriously?

347
00:17:49,263 --> 00:17:51,049
Yeah, it seems that person

348
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:55,863
also knew that I often got into arguments with Mr. Kudo.

349
00:17:55,863 --> 00:17:57,663
And said that camouflaging it as a suicide

350
00:17:57,663 --> 00:17:59,763
would be to my benefit as well.

351
00:17:59,763 --> 00:18:01,059
Argument?

352
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:03,061
Like over the meals I made...

353
00:18:03,263 --> 00:18:06,463
Mr. Kudo was picky about his likes and dislikes.

354
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:10,563
And I've often complained about it to my co-workers.

355
00:18:10,563 --> 00:18:11,963
Speaking of meals,

356
00:18:11,963 --> 00:18:14,163
what were you planning on doing earlier?

357
00:18:14,163 --> 00:18:17,063
You said you were going to buy groceries for dinner,

358
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,563
but you didn't go, right?

359
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:21,963
I usually come here straight

360
00:18:21,963 --> 00:18:23,763
from the supermarket with groceries.

361
00:18:23,763 --> 00:18:25,763
I was instructed to use those

362
00:18:25,763 --> 00:18:28,463
to make it appear as if I had gone shopping.

363
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:31,863
Then what were you planning to make tonight?

364
00:18:31,863 --> 00:18:33,091
Boiled mackerel in soy sauce.

365
00:18:34,663 --> 00:18:37,095
You mean Ms. Abukawa, the caretaker?

366
00:18:37,263 --> 00:18:39,363
She came here today at noon.

367
00:18:39,363 --> 00:18:41,363
Well, she was persistent today as well,

368
00:18:41,363 --> 00:18:43,101
she's such a tough customer.

369
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:45,863
-Persistent? -About the sliced mackerel!

370
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:48,563
A little of the red juice had collected inside of the pack,

371
00:18:48,563 --> 00:18:50,263
so she demanded a discount.

372
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:53,963
Even though the price had already been lowered.

373
00:18:53,963 --> 00:18:57,115
Well, then, thank you very much.

374
00:18:57,115 --> 00:19:00,163
Looks like what she said...

375
00:19:00,163 --> 00:19:02,663
Might actually be the truth.

376
00:19:02,663 --> 00:19:03,863
If she did something as noticeable

377
00:19:03,863 --> 00:19:06,763
as haggling over the price a fish at noon,

378
00:19:06,763 --> 00:19:10,763
she couldn't use it as an alibi for later.

379
00:19:10,763 --> 00:19:12,463
And what about the culprit,

380
00:19:12,463 --> 00:19:15,133
did they say anything in regards to who they are?

381
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:17,135
Well...

382
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:20,663
A vengeful spirit?

383
00:19:20,663 --> 00:19:24,663
Did your caller really identify themselves as that?

384
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:28,363
Yeah, after they muttered that, the line went dead.

385
00:19:28,363 --> 00:19:30,663
Do you have any clues about it?

386
00:19:30,663 --> 00:19:33,663
Such as someone holds a grudge against the victim.

387
00:19:33,663 --> 00:19:35,153
Yeah, actually...

388
00:19:35,363 --> 00:19:37,463
Actually, the victim was

389
00:19:37,463 --> 00:19:40,763
an adopted son of the Inubushi Group president, Tsunichika,

390
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:43,161
who died five years ago.

391
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:45,663
And it seems he's been frightened about it lately.

392
00:19:45,663 --> 00:19:48,763
He said that a bad person had infiltrated the Inubushi family

393
00:19:48,763 --> 00:19:50,263
and was intent on rooting out

394
00:19:50,263 --> 00:19:52,963
everyone with Inubushi blood using a cursed demon dog.

395
00:19:52,963 --> 00:19:55,463
Demon dog?

396
00:19:55,463 --> 00:19:59,177
It sounds like a story from a mystery novel.

397
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:02,863
There was a Sherlock Holmes story like that, wasn't there?

398
00:20:02,863 --> 00:20:04,563
Wasn't that The Inugami Clan?

399
00:20:06,563 --> 00:20:09,187
And, didn't you hear anything from the victim?

400
00:20:09,363 --> 00:20:11,863
Did he have any appointments to see somebody recently?

401
00:20:11,863 --> 00:20:13,863
I only heard that

402
00:20:13,863 --> 00:20:17,195
a young boy detective from Osaka was coming.

403
00:20:17,195 --> 00:20:20,263
Since the culprit also knew of this,

404
00:20:20,263 --> 00:20:22,963
it means that this was definitely a crime by an acquaintance.

405
00:20:22,963 --> 00:20:24,263
Yeah,

406
00:20:24,263 --> 00:20:29,207
perhaps he was intending to go out somewhere with that culprit.

407
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:31,663
Why would you say that?

408
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:34,463
When I found him inside the wardrobe,

409
00:20:34,463 --> 00:20:37,215
he was wearing a business suit and necktie.

410
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:38,663
Business suit?

411
00:20:38,663 --> 00:20:40,063
And necktie?

412
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,363
So you removed those

413
00:20:42,363 --> 00:20:45,223
and put him in a jersey like that, right?

414
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:48,463
Yes, the culprit ordered me to do so.

415
00:20:48,463 --> 00:20:51,229
Then you laid the body on the bed

416
00:20:51,463 --> 00:20:54,063
and waited for the child detective to come.

417
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:57,235
And after you showed the victim to him as if he was sleeping,

418
00:20:57,463 --> 00:20:58,463
you said that you were going shopping

419
00:20:58,463 --> 00:20:59,963
but actually entered the bedroom,

420
00:20:59,963 --> 00:21:02,063
where you moved the body to the floor

421
00:21:02,063 --> 00:21:03,663
and placed the charcoal grill,

422
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:06,063
and taped up the window and the door.

423
00:21:06,063 --> 00:21:09,247
Finally, you pressed the CD's play button,

424
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:13,251
and hid yourself in a position that would become a blind spot.

425
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:15,253
After that, when Hattori's group came in

426
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:17,763
after being surprised by the CD music,

427
00:21:17,763 --> 00:21:21,263
they'd focus on the window, the body and the grill

428
00:21:21,263 --> 00:21:22,763
and enabling you to leave the blind spot

429
00:21:22,763 --> 00:21:24,463
and move to the doorway.

430
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:27,663
Then you proceeded to pretend that you had just returned from shopping

431
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:31,263
all by order of this culprit, is that correct?

432
00:21:31,263 --> 00:21:33,663
Yes, I'm sorry.

433
00:21:33,663 --> 00:21:37,275
By the way, can you tell me if anything was stolen?

434
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:41,863
Well, not sure. Only Mr. Kudo himself would know the answer...

435
00:21:41,863 --> 00:21:43,663
But...

436
00:21:43,663 --> 00:21:47,285
The ornament attached to his necktie pin was removed.

437
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:49,063
A necktie pin?

438
00:21:49,063 --> 00:21:51,863
Was there an expensive jewel attached earlier?

439
00:21:51,863 --> 00:21:53,291
No.

440
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,363
I only noticed that there were signs

441
00:21:54,363 --> 00:21:57,963
of something having been removed from it.

442
00:21:57,963 --> 00:21:59,863
As far as what that was, I have no idea.

443
00:21:59,863 --> 00:22:04,163
I almost never see Mr. Kudo in a business suit, so...

444
00:22:04,163 --> 00:22:06,363
Turn him face-up and put him on the stretcher!

445
00:22:06,363 --> 00:22:09,307
-Okay. -Ready, and... go!

446
00:22:14,263 --> 00:22:15,863
Something fell out of his mouth!

447
00:22:15,863 --> 00:22:17,315
It was small and round.

448
00:22:21,063 --> 00:22:22,263
-A pearl? -A pearl?

449
00:22:22,263 --> 00:22:24,963
Hey, have that necktie pin checked right now!

450
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:29,327
Because if this poor man's saliva is found on it...

451
00:22:29,563 --> 00:22:31,329
The fact that he bit this pearl away

452
00:22:31,563 --> 00:22:34,763
from his own necktie pin during his final moments

453
00:22:34,763 --> 00:22:37,335
could be his dying message to us!

454
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,152
Next Conan's Hint:

455
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:05,423
"Spheres".

456
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:40,390
We have another big case that reeks of a bad smell next time!
