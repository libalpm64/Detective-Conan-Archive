1
00:00:13,746 --> 00:00:15,346
I'm sorry, Yuika.

2
00:00:15,346 --> 00:00:17,146
"Mihiro Kuze (26)" -About Mr. Monwaki...

3
00:00:17,146 --> 00:00:19,646
If I were more reliable,

4
00:00:19,646 --> 00:00:23,546
you guys didn't have to end up that way.

5
00:00:23,546 --> 00:00:26,005
It's okay, Mihiro.

6
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:29,146
Who cares about a guy who has to fool around with a friend of mine?

7
00:00:29,146 --> 00:00:33,346
"Yuka Shodo (26)" -Right now, I'm glad I split with a guy like him.

8
00:00:33,346 --> 00:00:36,346
Did you buy the clothes that you're going to be wearing tomorrow?

9
00:00:36,346 --> 00:00:38,017
Yep, I did!

10
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,019
A cute Goth Lolita outfit!

11
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:42,021
I'm wearing it right now!

12
00:00:43,246 --> 00:00:45,646
You can look forward to seeing it tomorrow!

13
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:49,046
Okay, I'll wait for you at the usual place then.

14
00:00:49,046 --> 00:00:50,546
Okay.

15
00:00:50,546 --> 00:00:53,046
Yuika.

16
00:00:53,046 --> 00:00:56,446
We're best friends, right?

17
00:00:56,446 --> 00:00:58,646
What a stupid thing to say!

18
00:00:58,646 --> 00:01:01,146
Until death, of course!

19
00:01:01,146 --> 00:01:03,546
Yuika.

20
00:01:03,546 --> 00:01:06,446
See you tomorrow, I'll be looking forward to seeing it!

21
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:08,047
Yes!

22
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,346
Until death... that is.

23
00:01:27,246 --> 00:01:29,246
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

24
00:01:29,246 --> 00:01:31,646
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

25
00:01:31,646 --> 00:01:33,246
What is the black conspiracy

26
00:01:33,246 --> 00:01:35,446
that is hidden behind The Goth Lolita outfit?

27
00:01:35,446 --> 00:01:37,246
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:37,246 --> 00:01:39,246
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:39,246 --> 00:01:41,346
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

30
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:27,952
"Alibi of the Black Dress (Part 1)"

31
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:32,191
Darn it.

32
00:03:33,652 --> 00:03:38,197
What cruse of fate has brought the famed Kogoro Mouri

33
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:43,452
to shop along with two girls on my precious day off.

34
00:03:43,452 --> 00:03:45,752
It won't hurt to do so once in a while!

35
00:03:45,752 --> 00:03:47,752
Your eyes will enjoy

36
00:03:47,752 --> 00:03:51,152
all the nice looking young girls walking through town!

37
00:03:51,152 --> 00:03:53,252
Besides...

38
00:03:53,252 --> 00:03:54,552
You have all the time in the world

39
00:03:54,552 --> 00:03:56,652
because you had no incoming job anyway.

40
00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:58,652
Idiot! I had to organize the dramas

41
00:03:58,652 --> 00:04:00,852
I recorded on the DVD recorder.

42
00:04:00,852 --> 00:04:02,852
I had to also go check on the way the balls

43
00:04:02,852 --> 00:04:05,452
come out on the machine of a new panchinko shop that's opening too,

44
00:04:05,452 --> 00:04:07,752
and also...

45
00:04:07,752 --> 00:04:10,229
Today's the G1 horse race!

46
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:12,231
That's the kind of stuff that people refer to

47
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:15,152
as someone who has all the time in the world do!

48
00:04:15,152 --> 00:04:16,235
What?

49
00:04:16,452 --> 00:04:18,752
Dad, don't go wasting your money

50
00:04:18,752 --> 00:04:21,152
on stuff like pachinko and horse racing!

51
00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:23,752
Talk for yourself!

52
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:26,652
You're going to get it if you buy super expensive clothes!

53
00:04:26,652 --> 00:04:28,247
Don't worry.

54
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:31,252
I'm only buying cheap cute clothes!

55
00:04:31,252 --> 00:04:32,952
Right!

56
00:04:34,652 --> 00:04:36,052
I don't care what

57
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:38,257
but show it to me before you buy it, now!

58
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:40,052
What?

59
00:04:40,052 --> 00:04:43,052
Oh, no, I don't think so.

60
00:04:44,052 --> 00:04:45,652
What's this?

61
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,652
Are you saying that you're going to buy lewd clothes

62
00:04:47,652 --> 00:04:49,752
that you can't even show your parent?

63
00:04:49,752 --> 00:04:52,652
Like teeny-weeny T-shirts that show your belly

64
00:04:52,652 --> 00:04:56,275
or Chinese dresses that reveal most of your thighs?

65
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:58,277
That's more your taste.

66
00:04:58,452 --> 00:05:00,279
You don't have to look at them

67
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,281
because none of them are going to be sexy.

68
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:04,283
Well, I think you'll be surprised either way

69
00:05:04,452 --> 00:05:06,285
if you see them anyway.

70
00:05:10,752 --> 00:05:12,291
Hello!

71
00:05:21,552 --> 00:05:25,852
What's that look about, that witch looking outfit...

72
00:05:25,852 --> 00:05:27,452
-Super cute! -Super cute!

73
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,307
What?

74
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:30,309
It's Goth Lolita, Goth Lolita!

75
00:05:30,552 --> 00:05:32,311
It's nice after all!

76
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:34,313
Goth... Lolita?

77
00:05:34,552 --> 00:05:38,317
Gothic Lolita is a fashion in which black clothes

78
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:40,852
that are worn by vampires and draculas that appear in Gothic novels

79
00:05:40,852 --> 00:05:44,852
or monster movies based on such things are worn.

80
00:05:44,852 --> 00:05:50,752
They also said on TV that these outfits are very womanly!

81
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:56,335
Just what kind of programs is he usually watching anyway?

82
00:05:56,335 --> 00:06:00,339
Well... it's the kind of fashion I think Ai would look good in.

83
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,752
I hope you two aren't planning

84
00:06:02,752 --> 00:06:06,345
to buy that monster-like outfit too, are you?

85
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:08,347
We're buying something that's cuter!

86
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:11,052
Something like what a doll would wear.

87
00:06:11,052 --> 00:06:13,752
You mean, Lolita fashions then.

88
00:06:13,752 --> 00:06:17,152
I don't know about this Goth Lolita or Ghost Lotta thing,

89
00:06:17,152 --> 00:06:19,752
but I'm not ever letting you

90
00:06:19,752 --> 00:06:22,361
wear a Halloween outfit like fashion like that!

91
00:06:40,552 --> 00:06:42,952
Thank you for waiting.

92
00:06:42,952 --> 00:06:46,052
Uh... That customer that was here just now...

93
00:06:46,052 --> 00:06:50,052
I hope she didn't leave because I criticized her outfit.

94
00:06:50,052 --> 00:06:52,752
Oh, no. She said that

95
00:06:52,752 --> 00:06:55,452
the friend that she's waiting for hasn't come yet.

96
00:06:55,452 --> 00:06:58,397
So, she seems to have gone the restroom.

97
00:06:58,397 --> 00:07:01,552
The restroom is outside the shop, you see.

98
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:02,852
I see.

99
00:07:07,852 --> 00:07:09,752
The lady who was wearing the Goth Lolita outfit

100
00:07:09,752 --> 00:07:12,411
hasn't come back yet.

101
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:14,413
If she's waiting for someone,

102
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:16,952
it'd be better if she's in her seat and yet...

103
00:07:16,952 --> 00:07:20,052
Women take their time in the restroom, so...

104
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:25,552
Hello! For one?

105
00:07:25,552 --> 00:07:29,152
Oh, no. Didn't a girl in Goth Lolita outfit come?

106
00:07:29,152 --> 00:07:31,252
She's my friend.

107
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:32,752
She's here.

108
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:35,252
She's sing the restroom now, though.

109
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:39,452
Oh my, I'm 10 minutes late.

110
00:07:39,452 --> 00:07:41,352
What did Mihiro order?

111
00:07:41,352 --> 00:07:42,441
Well, nothing yet,

112
00:07:42,652 --> 00:07:45,352
although she was looking through the menu.

113
00:07:45,352 --> 00:07:48,447
She said she'd order after her friend arrives.

114
00:07:48,652 --> 00:07:52,451
Okay then, I'll wait till Mihiro comes and then, place my order.

115
00:07:53,152 --> 00:07:54,452
Hey...

116
00:07:56,252 --> 00:07:58,457
I'm sorry!

117
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:01,652
No problem. I'll clean it up.

118
00:08:01,652 --> 00:08:03,952
Really, I'm sorry.

119
00:08:03,952 --> 00:08:05,252
No problem.

120
00:08:07,952 --> 00:08:10,469
Well, I drank what I wanted to,

121
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:12,752
so let's start off into town!

122
00:08:12,752 --> 00:08:15,152
We checked out the shops through and through already too!

123
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:21,152
Okay, we're going, kid!

124
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:23,552
Hey!

125
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:25,252
Yep.

126
00:08:31,752 --> 00:08:34,493
Hey...

127
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:38,852
What's with everybody, wearing crazy clothes?

128
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,952
Just as would be expected of Harajuku.

129
00:08:40,952 --> 00:08:43,852
Don't tell me that you guys are like these people.

130
00:08:43,852 --> 00:08:46,505
I mean, they're gone!

131
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:49,952
Ran and Sonoko said that they're going shopping,

132
00:08:49,952 --> 00:08:52,511
so for us to browse around this area!

133
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:55,252
Darn! Just what do they think they're doing?

134
00:08:55,252 --> 00:08:57,552
There's no reason for me to come along then!

135
00:08:57,552 --> 00:09:01,552
Rather, there is... You're probably here because...

136
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:06,525
Just as I thought.

137
00:09:06,752 --> 00:09:08,852
They want you to carry their shopping bags.

138
00:09:09,952 --> 00:09:11,652
Next, this store!

139
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:13,852
This is cute, isn't it?

140
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:15,852
What's cute about it anyway?

141
00:09:15,852 --> 00:09:19,052
Hey, don't peek inside!

142
00:09:19,052 --> 00:09:21,252
Then, hold your own stuff!

143
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:31,352
Hey, oh no!

144
00:09:31,352 --> 00:09:33,452
Isn't this ice cream?

145
00:09:38,752 --> 00:09:39,952
What language?

146
00:09:39,952 --> 00:09:42,152
I'm not sure because it's too fast.

147
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:49,452
They're ice cream thieves!

148
00:09:49,452 --> 00:09:50,569
Thieves?

149
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:52,352
No!

150
00:09:52,352 --> 00:09:56,575
It's used a lot abroad to steal things from Japanese people!

151
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:59,052
When trying to wipe the ice cream off,

152
00:09:59,052 --> 00:10:00,579
in order to free your hands,

153
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:03,252
you'll put the things that you're holding down, right?

154
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:05,952
And while one is talking away in a foreign language,

155
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:07,652
in order to distract the victim,

156
00:10:07,652 --> 00:10:09,552
his accomplice takes off

157
00:10:09,552 --> 00:10:12,252
after stealing the belongings of that tourist.

158
00:10:15,152 --> 00:10:17,552
Hey! Hold it!

159
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:19,752
I mean, I saw it on TV.

160
00:10:21,252 --> 00:10:25,252
I wonder what kind of programs Conan is always watching!

161
00:10:25,252 --> 00:10:27,452
But, talk about bummers...

162
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:30,352
We can't shop with our clothes like this.

163
00:10:30,352 --> 00:10:34,352
Then, why don't you change into the clothes you bought?

164
00:10:36,252 --> 00:10:38,617
I mean, you bought it already, so why not?

165
00:10:42,052 --> 00:10:46,252
Listen? Both of you! Don't you dare laugh, okay?

166
00:10:46,252 --> 00:10:48,252
Well, I know we'll be taken aback, though.

167
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:55,252
There are so many customers before us.

168
00:10:58,852 --> 00:11:01,752
They seem to be here for the same purpose.

169
00:11:01,752 --> 00:11:03,552
Hey, you!

170
00:11:03,552 --> 00:11:06,652
Come out, already! Darn!

171
00:11:06,652 --> 00:11:09,152
What seems to be the matter?

172
00:11:09,152 --> 00:11:13,352
The person's been in here for over 30 minutes already!

173
00:11:13,352 --> 00:11:17,952
Maybe she's passed out from a heart stroke or something.

174
00:11:17,952 --> 00:11:21,052
-What? -In that case...

175
00:11:21,052 --> 00:11:22,252
Sonoko!

176
00:11:22,252 --> 00:11:24,663
I'll take a look from above.

177
00:11:31,152 --> 00:11:33,252
Hey, what's up?

178
00:11:33,252 --> 00:11:36,675
In... In the toilet... compartment...

179
00:11:36,852 --> 00:11:39,452
The Goth... Goth Lolita...

180
00:11:39,452 --> 00:11:40,952
Huh?

181
00:11:40,952 --> 00:11:42,681
Just what're you talking about?

182
00:11:52,252 --> 00:11:54,352
There are strangulation marks on the neck

183
00:11:54,352 --> 00:11:56,252
as well as "Yoshikawa Lines" showing that

184
00:11:56,252 --> 00:11:58,697
the victim scratched her neck in resistance.

185
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:00,699
Murder by strangulation...

186
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:17,092
Gee, but what an outfit...

187
00:12:17,092 --> 00:12:19,392
The clothes that this victim is wearing.

188
00:12:19,392 --> 00:12:22,492
You mean this is the trend nowadays?

189
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,723
No, it's called Goth Lolita fashion

190
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:28,727
and has been around for some time already.

191
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:32,292
I'm sorry I don't know anything about these trendy things.

192
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:34,392
Oh, don't be.

193
00:12:34,392 --> 00:12:37,892
And? What about the identity of the victim?

194
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:40,992
From the driver's license that she had on her,

195
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:45,492
she's a resident of Haido cho named Ms. Mihiro Kuze.

196
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:51,992
There are strangulation marks and Yoshikawa lines on her neck.

197
00:12:51,992 --> 00:12:54,753
No doubt this is murder by strangulation.

198
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:56,755
Yoshikawa line?

199
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:58,757
What's that?

200
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:01,392
It's police jargon.

201
00:13:01,392 --> 00:13:03,492
When a person is strangled,

202
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:06,192
they try to remove the string or rope that's around their neck

203
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:09,092
with their hand because they can't breathe, right?

204
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:10,769
Most times

205
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:13,592
the nail marks of the person who is being strangled are left behind!

206
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:17,392
This happens because the pain of being choked

207
00:13:17,392 --> 00:13:20,092
is much less tolerable than the pain of scratching!

208
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:22,781
And the first person who took note of the fact

209
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:25,392
that the scratch marks are evidence of someone

210
00:13:25,392 --> 00:13:27,592
who had been murdered by strangulation was

211
00:13:27,592 --> 00:13:30,792
a man called Mr. Youichi Yoshikawa who used to work as a forensic officer

212
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:33,592
at the police department in the Taisho Era.

213
00:13:33,592 --> 00:13:38,797
Since then, the scratch marks are referred to as Yoshikawa marks!

214
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:42,292
And you're going to say that you watched it on TV again?

215
00:13:43,392 --> 00:13:44,592
Yep.

216
00:13:44,592 --> 00:13:46,092
On what kind of program?

217
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,807
The evening news.

218
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:56,092
And? Is it true that you people saw this woman today?

219
00:13:56,092 --> 00:13:57,292
Yes.

220
00:13:57,292 --> 00:14:00,819
I accompanied by daughter and her friend shopping today.

221
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:05,092
They stopped by at a bookstore in Shinjuku before shopping,

222
00:14:05,092 --> 00:14:07,392
and checked inside the fashion magazine

223
00:14:07,392 --> 00:14:09,992
that they bought at a coffee shop that we stepped into.

224
00:14:15,892 --> 00:14:18,837
That's when this victim walked in!

225
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:21,192
You mean a coffee shop in Shinjuku?

226
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:22,841
Yes, sir.

227
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:25,992
And when my daughter and her friend went into the restroom

228
00:14:25,992 --> 00:14:27,892
to change into the clothes that they bought in Shinjuku,

229
00:14:27,892 --> 00:14:30,849
they happened to run into her again!

230
00:14:31,092 --> 00:14:34,092
To this ruthlessly murder woman here...

231
00:14:34,092 --> 00:14:36,855
When the victim came to the coffee shop,

232
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:39,292
wasn't she with someone?

233
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:42,861
It seems she was waiting for a friend to come there.

234
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:46,392
A woman wearing glasses who looked like she was an office worker.

235
00:14:46,392 --> 00:14:49,692
What time did the two come to the coffee shop?

236
00:14:49,692 --> 00:14:50,869
The woman dressed in Goth Lolita outfit

237
00:14:51,092 --> 00:14:52,892
came a little before 13:00.

238
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,892
And the office lady looking person

239
00:14:54,892 --> 00:14:58,492
came 10 or 15 minutes afterwards.

240
00:14:58,492 --> 00:15:02,892
The estimated time of death was the one hour

241
00:15:02,892 --> 00:15:05,292
between 12:30 in the afternoon to 13:30?

242
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:06,292
Yes, sir.

243
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:08,892
Which means that there's a possibility that

244
00:15:08,892 --> 00:15:11,292
the office lady, after meeting the victim at the shop,

245
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:14,092
brought her to the restroom here, in this park in Harajuku

246
00:15:14,092 --> 00:15:16,392
and killed her.

247
00:15:16,392 --> 00:15:19,392
But, how did she lock the door

248
00:15:19,392 --> 00:15:21,392
leaving the dead body on the toilet seat?

249
00:15:21,392 --> 00:15:23,192
After closing the door,

250
00:15:23,192 --> 00:15:25,992
she got on top of this bucket that was in the tool closet

251
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:28,192
and used the handle of the brush inserting it from above the door

252
00:15:28,192 --> 00:15:30,192
and locked the door.

253
00:15:30,192 --> 00:15:33,492
After all, the lock for this door is a simple slide type.

254
00:15:37,092 --> 00:15:39,892
Is this restroom always so crowded?

255
00:15:39,892 --> 00:15:43,292
No, it gets crowded just around this time

256
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:44,923
and it seems that by the time the girls got here,

257
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:47,392
the toilet door was already locked,

258
00:15:47,392 --> 00:15:49,992
and the cell phone seems to have been ringing occasionally.

259
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:52,692
-Cell phone? -Yes, sir.

260
00:15:52,692 --> 00:15:56,392
After checking the received calls history of the victim's cell phone,

261
00:15:56,392 --> 00:15:57,692
within the 2 hours that have gone by,

262
00:15:57,692 --> 00:16:01,592
it seems that someone has been calling this victim every 10 minutes.

263
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:04,692
Another call...

264
00:16:04,692 --> 00:16:07,392
It's the same number as the one in the received calls history!

265
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:10,949
Hey, Miharu!

266
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:12,192
Just what do you think you're doing?

267
00:16:12,192 --> 00:16:14,492
I've been waiting for you all this time at the coffee shop.

268
00:16:14,492 --> 00:16:16,092
Miharu?

269
00:16:16,092 --> 00:16:20,392
Well, I'm from the police.

270
00:16:20,392 --> 00:16:21,692
Police?

271
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:23,992
Is something wrong with Mihiro?

272
00:16:23,992 --> 00:16:25,592
The thing is...

273
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:31,292
No...

274
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:33,692
Mihiro, why?

275
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:36,692
There's no mistake that

276
00:16:36,692 --> 00:16:40,592
you were going to see Ms. Mihiro Kuze here today?

277
00:16:40,592 --> 00:16:42,292
Yes, sir.

278
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,392
At a coffee shop in Shinjuku at 13:00.

279
00:16:45,392 --> 00:16:48,987
And you came to this park restroom in Harajuku

280
00:16:49,192 --> 00:16:52,292
after meeting her at the coffee shop?

281
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:55,992
I haven't seen Mihiro at all today yet!

282
00:16:55,992 --> 00:16:59,492
Huh? But you both went to that shop?

283
00:16:59,492 --> 00:17:01,492
One came in after the other went out!

284
00:17:01,492 --> 00:17:03,692
About 10 minutes after the person wearing the Goth Lolita outfit

285
00:17:03,692 --> 00:17:06,392
went to use the restroom, she came.

286
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:10,792
Then, Mihiro never came back from the restroom?

287
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:13,392
No, sir! I had the person working here

288
00:17:13,392 --> 00:17:16,492
go check for her in the restroom,

289
00:17:16,492 --> 00:17:19,017
but there seems to have been no one there.

290
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:22,692
That's why I kept calling Mihiro's cell phone every 10 minutes.

291
00:17:22,692 --> 00:17:25,292
But just couldn't seem to get through.

292
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:27,692
And when I finally did get through...

293
00:17:27,692 --> 00:17:30,792
I answered the phone.

294
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:32,292
Yes!

295
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:36,392
But, why didn't you go check the restroom yourself?

296
00:17:36,392 --> 00:17:39,992
Because the restroom was outside the shop.

297
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:44,492
I thought that it's not good to leave the shop

298
00:17:44,492 --> 00:17:46,192
before paying for something I ordered.

299
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:48,092
Which means that you were in that coffee shop all the while,

300
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:49,692
from the time you arrived there?

301
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:53,892
Yes. I think the employee here can testify to that.

302
00:17:53,892 --> 00:17:58,292
I think it's only right to go take a look at the coffee shop then?

303
00:17:58,292 --> 00:18:01,892
I guess so, while your memories still fresh.

304
00:18:01,892 --> 00:18:05,063
Well, then, we'll head on for the shop,

305
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,065
so Officer Takagi, you wait here!

306
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:09,067
If you come up with something, contact me!

307
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:11,692
Yes, sir!

308
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:13,892
What's the matter, Sonoko?

309
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:20,692
Something just doesn't seem to feel right about her, don't you think?

310
00:18:20,692 --> 00:18:21,892
What about?

311
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,692
Usually, when you wear Goth Lolita clothes,

312
00:18:24,692 --> 00:18:28,492
don't you manicure your nails black or white?

313
00:18:28,492 --> 00:18:32,492
She has nothing on her nails.

314
00:18:32,492 --> 00:18:34,492
Come to think of it, I don't think she had anything on

315
00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:37,792
from the time she came to the coffee shop.

316
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:41,792
Didn't you find any fake nails on the floor of the toilet?

317
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:45,103
No, nothing was found on the floor.

318
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:49,107
Hey, what're you doing? Let's go!

319
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:51,692
You guys are witnesses too, you know!

320
00:18:51,692 --> 00:18:53,111
Yep.

321
00:18:56,292 --> 00:18:59,117
Yes, she came!

322
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:01,392
A little before 13:00...

323
00:19:01,392 --> 00:19:02,792
to this seat.

324
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:06,592
Are you sure there's no mistake that it was her?

325
00:19:06,592 --> 00:19:08,792
Yes, I'm sure.

326
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:11,692
She had a very small voice, though.

327
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,131
Small voice?

328
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:14,592
She asked me what time it was

329
00:19:14,592 --> 00:19:17,135
as soon as she got to her seat.

330
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:20,492
I told her it was 12:56.

331
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,192
Although the clock was right next to her seat.

332
00:19:24,192 --> 00:19:27,992
Is it true that she came to this shop

333
00:19:27,992 --> 00:19:31,792
about 10 minutes after this woman left for the restroom?

334
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:32,892
Yes.

335
00:19:32,892 --> 00:19:34,192
She said she was waiting for her friend

336
00:19:34,192 --> 00:19:36,892
who would be wearing Goth Lolita clothes.

337
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:41,159
Oh my, I'm 10 minutes late.

338
00:19:42,292 --> 00:19:45,163
I think it was around 13:12.

339
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:50,192
Was she at this seat all the while after that?

340
00:19:50,192 --> 00:19:54,092
Yes. It seemed she tried calling the woman

341
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,592
who went to the restroom repeatedly though.

342
00:19:58,192 --> 00:20:00,692
If she's the culprit,

343
00:20:00,692 --> 00:20:02,692
she would've had to call the victim out to the park

344
00:20:02,692 --> 00:20:04,192
right after she went to the restroom,

345
00:20:04,192 --> 00:20:08,192
and come back after killing her.

346
00:20:08,192 --> 00:20:10,792
But from the shop to the restroom of the park,

347
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,892
even if she were to use the train or a car,

348
00:20:12,892 --> 00:20:15,792
it would take at least 30 minutes to make a round trip.

349
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:21,892
She couldn't have committed the crime.

350
00:20:21,892 --> 00:20:25,203
I'm sure she was cursed by a bad witch!

351
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,205
What?

352
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:30,092
Witch, Conan?

353
00:20:30,092 --> 00:20:32,692
Because the lady in Goth Lolita clothes

354
00:20:32,692 --> 00:20:35,992
looked normal in the picture of her driver's license,

355
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:38,592
but when I saw her, she was wearing a dreadful look

356
00:20:38,592 --> 00:20:40,792
as if she were cursed or something!

357
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:42,492
Idiot!

358
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,292
When wearing Goth Lolita clothes,

359
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:46,892
you make your skin look white by wearing pale coloured foundation

360
00:20:46,892 --> 00:20:50,592
and use mascara to make your eyes stand out!

361
00:20:50,592 --> 00:20:53,992
Right, right. Even if Sonoko or I were to do it,

362
00:20:53,992 --> 00:20:56,192
our make-up would look like that.

363
00:20:56,192 --> 00:20:58,492
If the same goes for the clothes,

364
00:20:58,492 --> 00:21:01,239
it'll be hard to tell one person from the other!

365
00:21:06,392 --> 00:21:10,192
Inspector, maybe this is...

366
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:11,792
Yeah.

367
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:15,692
I guess we'll have to check and see

368
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:18,392
if the person who came to the shop was really Mihiro.

369
00:21:20,392 --> 00:21:21,892
A person dressed in Goth Lolita clothes

370
00:21:21,892 --> 00:21:25,992
was found dead in the restroom of a park.

371
00:21:25,992 --> 00:21:29,267
We were at this coffee shop in Shinjuku

372
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:32,192
and witnessed the victim before she was killed.

373
00:21:34,892 --> 00:21:36,892
She sat down

374
00:21:36,892 --> 00:21:39,292
and went to the restroom right away.

375
00:21:39,292 --> 00:21:40,792
After about 10 minutes,

376
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:43,292
the friend that she was waiting for appeared.

377
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:48,092
After that, the woman in Goth Lolita clothes

378
00:21:48,092 --> 00:21:50,092
never came back to the shop.

379
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,792
The victim is a person called

380
00:21:54,792 --> 00:21:58,092
Ms. Mihiro Kuze, a resident of Haido-cho.

381
00:21:58,092 --> 00:22:03,292
The one that was waiting for her was her friend, Ms. Yuika Shodo.

382
00:22:04,392 --> 00:22:06,692
Ms. Shodo was waiting for Mihiro all the while,

383
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,992
but Mihiro never came back.

384
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:12,292
From the park in Harajuku

385
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:14,392
where the toilet that the body was found was,

386
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:16,592
to this coffee shop in Shinjuku

387
00:22:16,592 --> 00:22:18,492
even if a car or train were used,

388
00:22:18,492 --> 00:22:20,692
it would take at least 30 minutes round trip.

389
00:22:22,192 --> 00:22:24,792
It would've been impossible for Ms. Shodo

390
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:27,592
who was at the shop all the while, to commit the crime.

391
00:22:27,592 --> 00:22:30,792
However, is it really so?

392
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:37,335
I don't think we'll be able to close this case that easily!

393
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,820
Next Conan's Hint:

394
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,423
"Twins"

395
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,080
Keep an eye on our fashion in the next episode.

396
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,429
You're both in unison with each other!
