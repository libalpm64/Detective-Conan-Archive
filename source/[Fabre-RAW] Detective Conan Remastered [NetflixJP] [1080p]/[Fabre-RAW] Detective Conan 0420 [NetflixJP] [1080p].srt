1
00:00:02,356 --> 00:00:03,956
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:03,956 --> 00:00:06,256
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:07,656
Thoughtfulness and kindness for the one you love.

4
00:00:07,656 --> 00:00:09,156
Brings about misunderstanding,

5
00:00:09,156 --> 00:00:10,856
but at long last, the true killer is found in the homeland of mythology.

6
00:00:10,856 --> 00:00:12,456
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,456 --> 00:00:14,356
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,356 --> 00:00:16,556
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,682 --> 00:02:01,782
We came on a sightseeing trip to Izumo, the homeland of mythology,

10
00:02:01,782 --> 00:02:05,682
and we become acquainted with a woman named Eiko Esumi there.

11
00:02:06,682 --> 00:02:10,882
The following day, Eiko's fiance is killed

12
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:14,682
and a robbery case of a sword worth 10,000,000 yen occurs.

13
00:02:16,082 --> 00:02:19,982
And of the four suspects that were summoned to the police

14
00:02:19,982 --> 00:02:23,682
were Eiko and her childhood friend.

15
00:02:23,682 --> 00:02:27,482
Please tell me where and what each of you were doing

16
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:29,382
at around 13:00 yesterday.

17
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:32,382
It was my day off yesterday,

18
00:02:32,382 --> 00:02:35,682
so I went to Old Taisha Station.

19
00:02:35,682 --> 00:02:37,382
Lastly, Ms. Esumi?

20
00:02:37,382 --> 00:02:40,282
I was at Hinomisaki.

21
00:02:40,282 --> 00:02:44,182
Eiko and Mr. Fukuma aren't the ones, are they?

22
00:02:44,182 --> 00:02:45,382
No.

23
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:48,582
I wonder why there are no witnesses whatsoever.

24
00:02:48,582 --> 00:02:50,582
Could it be that they're lying?

25
00:02:51,882 --> 00:02:57,682
"The Sword of Yamatano Orochi (Part 2)"

26
00:02:58,582 --> 00:03:00,782
Are you sure you didn't see wrong?

27
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:02,882
Of course not.

28
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,982
I've known her since she was born.

29
00:03:04,982 --> 00:03:08,082
She was Eiko of Hinodeya.

30
00:03:08,082 --> 00:03:09,982
It was after noon yesterday?

31
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:12,782
Yep. Just about 13:00.

32
00:03:12,782 --> 00:03:15,782
She always sits on that chair over there.

33
00:03:17,082 --> 00:03:21,082
Eiko was here at the time that Mr. Wanibuchi was killed?

34
00:03:22,582 --> 00:03:26,482
Since there's a witness, Eiko's alibi's been established.

35
00:03:26,482 --> 00:03:29,082
But why did she say she was at Hinomisaki?

36
00:03:29,082 --> 00:03:31,482
Let's go tell Pops and the others.

37
00:03:32,582 --> 00:03:35,482
It's just as she and Conan are saying.

38
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:39,082
I was at Old Taisha Station.

39
00:03:39,082 --> 00:03:40,582
-What? -What?

40
00:03:40,582 --> 00:03:43,782
I go there a lot when I have time.

41
00:03:43,782 --> 00:03:47,782
I feel relaxed when I go there.

42
00:03:47,782 --> 00:03:50,782
It is also the place where the history of my mother and father started.

43
00:03:53,082 --> 00:03:55,982
My mother happened to stop by when on a trip and came here to Izumo.

44
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:58,682
She just happened to spend the night at my father's inn.

45
00:03:58,682 --> 00:04:01,982
They were both attracted to each other and eventually got married.

46
00:04:01,982 --> 00:04:03,882
Then I was born.

47
00:04:03,882 --> 00:04:06,582
Although the railroad line has already been discontinued,

48
00:04:06,582 --> 00:04:07,982
when I go there,

49
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:10,782
I feel like I can see the beginning of everything.

50
00:04:10,782 --> 00:04:13,882
I like that station.

51
00:04:13,882 --> 00:04:17,182
No matter how much you look for witnesses who've seen Eiko at Hinomisaki,

52
00:04:17,182 --> 00:04:19,382
you wouldn't find them

53
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:20,682
because she didn't go there.

54
00:04:22,682 --> 00:04:25,082
If you were at Old Taisha Station,

55
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:27,882
why didn't you say so to begin with?

56
00:04:27,882 --> 00:04:30,182
Why did you lie about it?

57
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:31,882
Well...

58
00:04:31,882 --> 00:04:34,482
Because Mr. Fukuma said what he did, right?

59
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,482
What?

60
00:04:35,482 --> 00:04:38,482
It was my day off yesterday,

61
00:04:38,482 --> 00:04:40,882
so I went to Old Taisha Station.

62
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:44,382
You were more surprised than anyone else back then, weren't you, Eiko?

63
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:49,482
Because you were there, but Mr. Fukuma wasn't.

64
00:04:49,482 --> 00:04:51,382
He killed Mr. Wanibuchi for me,

65
00:04:51,382 --> 00:04:54,982
that's the only thing I could think of.

66
00:04:54,982 --> 00:05:00,282
So I couldn't tell the truth if I mentioned Old Taisha Station.

67
00:05:00,282 --> 00:05:02,382
It would contradict his.

68
00:05:02,382 --> 00:05:05,982
But I was alone too, so there are no witnesses.

69
00:05:07,082 --> 00:05:08,782
If we were at the same place,

70
00:05:08,782 --> 00:05:11,382
there's no way that we wouldn't have seen each other.

71
00:05:11,382 --> 00:05:17,182
Since Mr. Fukuma lied before you, you couldn't help but lie.

72
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:20,582
Hinomisaki just happened to cross my mind

73
00:05:20,582 --> 00:05:22,582
since I like it there, too.

74
00:05:22,582 --> 00:05:24,982
I see, so that's the story.

75
00:05:24,982 --> 00:05:27,382
But if Ms. Esumi is innocent,

76
00:05:27,382 --> 00:05:29,682
Mr. Fukuma's activities become questionable.

77
00:05:29,682 --> 00:05:37,482
He took the sword away from the murder site not to protect Ms. Esumi,

78
00:05:37,482 --> 00:05:40,682
but to hide what he did.

79
00:05:40,682 --> 00:05:42,482
I don't think that's right.

80
00:05:43,982 --> 00:05:48,682
Eiko as well as Mr. Fukuma just had a mutual misunderstanding.

81
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,982
A mutual misunderstanding?

82
00:05:50,982 --> 00:05:54,182
If you tell Mr. Fukuma that Eiko has been cleared from suspicion,

83
00:05:54,182 --> 00:05:57,082
I'm sure he'll tell you everything.

84
00:05:57,082 --> 00:05:58,982
I'll bring Fukuma here.

85
00:06:01,882 --> 00:06:04,582
Eiko, it wasn't you?

86
00:06:04,582 --> 00:06:08,182
I was at Old Taisha Station right through.

87
00:06:08,182 --> 00:06:11,682
But then, why?

88
00:06:11,682 --> 00:06:12,982
Was this there?

89
00:06:14,482 --> 00:06:16,982
What is this?

90
00:06:16,982 --> 00:06:18,782
Where did you find this?

91
00:06:18,782 --> 00:06:20,582
Where else?

92
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:26,682
Could you explain in chronological order please?

93
00:06:26,682 --> 00:06:27,882
Yes.

94
00:06:27,882 --> 00:06:32,782
Yesterday at noon, I did go to Inome Cave.

95
00:06:32,782 --> 00:06:37,082
But it wasn't to kill Mr. Wanibuchi.

96
00:06:37,082 --> 00:06:40,682
The day before yesterday, Eiko told me that...

97
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:43,082
she was called out by Wanibuchi.

98
00:06:43,082 --> 00:06:47,182
He told me to come to Inome Cave at 13:30.

99
00:06:47,182 --> 00:06:49,482
Why's he asking you to come to a lonely place like that?

100
00:06:49,482 --> 00:06:53,082
I'm sure he's up to no good.

101
00:06:53,082 --> 00:06:54,482
Don't go!

102
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:56,082
I'll go in place of you.

103
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,482
I'll have a good talk with him

104
00:06:57,482 --> 00:07:00,382
and make him give you up, once and for all.

105
00:07:00,382 --> 00:07:01,682
Ryo.

106
00:07:01,682 --> 00:07:04,282
Noon tomorrow, at 13:30.

107
00:07:05,482 --> 00:07:08,282
So yesterday, in order to talk it out with him...

108
00:07:09,482 --> 00:07:10,582
Wanibuchi?

109
00:07:19,082 --> 00:07:20,082
Eiko?

110
00:07:22,082 --> 00:07:23,682
You found this there?

111
00:07:23,682 --> 00:07:27,182
I recognized it right away because this is what I gave you.

112
00:07:27,182 --> 00:07:30,082
I will have to keep it for a while.

113
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,882
The key is this pendant.

114
00:07:32,882 --> 00:07:36,982
I thought you went despite me telling you not to go.

115
00:07:36,982 --> 00:07:40,082
Thinking that Eiko had killed him,

116
00:07:40,082 --> 00:07:43,882
you impulsively stole the sword to make it look like a robbery?

117
00:07:43,882 --> 00:07:46,382
Oh, yes.

118
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,282
The story makes sense.

119
00:07:49,282 --> 00:07:50,782
I'm sorry, Ryo.

120
00:07:50,782 --> 00:07:54,782
I lost that pendant several days ago.

121
00:07:54,782 --> 00:07:56,482
I couldn't make myself tell you.

122
00:07:56,482 --> 00:07:59,382
So that's what you meant, Conan,

123
00:07:59,382 --> 00:08:02,182
when you said they had a mutual misunderstanding.

124
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:05,182
They both thought that their partner was the killer.

125
00:08:05,182 --> 00:08:08,782
They both lied to protect each other.

126
00:08:08,782 --> 00:08:11,982
How cute. How so very cute.

127
00:08:11,982 --> 00:08:13,382
It's not cute!

128
00:08:13,382 --> 00:08:16,982
How dare you both confuse the case the way you did!

129
00:08:16,982 --> 00:08:20,982
Mr. Fukuma, you stealing the sword is nothing other than a crime!

130
00:08:20,982 --> 00:08:22,682
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

131
00:08:22,682 --> 00:08:24,182
If you didn't take the pendant away,

132
00:08:24,182 --> 00:08:28,682
maybe the fingerprints of the real killer were on them!

133
00:08:28,682 --> 00:08:32,682
I completely thought it was Eiko, so I...

134
00:08:32,682 --> 00:08:35,182
If so, the more so!

135
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:38,282
Trying to cover up somebody else's crime is not love!

136
00:08:40,282 --> 00:08:41,582
Ryo.

137
00:08:41,582 --> 00:08:43,482
I understand.

138
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:48,182
Which means that the one who killed Mr. Wanibuchi is Kazuya Ishitobi.

139
00:08:48,182 --> 00:08:52,682
That jittery attitude of Mr. Ishitobi sure is worth suspecting.

140
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:55,282
The way Mr. Fujie acted surprised

141
00:08:55,282 --> 00:08:58,882
when I introduced myself also bothers me.

142
00:08:58,882 --> 00:09:02,582
The real killer had this pendant, right?

143
00:09:02,582 --> 00:09:04,082
Probably.

144
00:09:04,082 --> 00:09:07,982
And he dropped it when he killed Mr. Wanibuchi.

145
00:09:07,982 --> 00:09:11,182
Rather, he deliberately put it near the corpse!

146
00:09:12,682 --> 00:09:15,682
You said you lost it several days ago, didn't you?

147
00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:20,182
Before that, did you see Mr. Ishitobi or Mr. Fujie?

148
00:09:20,182 --> 00:09:21,482
Come to think of it...

149
00:09:21,482 --> 00:09:23,482
Come on, Eiko!

150
00:09:23,482 --> 00:09:27,382
If it's for you who he loves, I'm sure he'll listen.

151
00:09:27,382 --> 00:09:32,582
Marry him and please tell him not to take us over!

152
00:09:32,582 --> 00:09:33,782
Please!

153
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,682
Just what do you think you're saying, Mr. Fujie?

154
00:09:36,682 --> 00:09:40,082
Are saying you want our daughter to sacrifice herself

155
00:09:40,082 --> 00:09:43,082
for the sake of saving your wedding hall?

156
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,982
I'm pleading knowing what a selfish request this is.

157
00:09:45,982 --> 00:09:48,982
Please. Eiko, please!

158
00:09:48,982 --> 00:09:50,582
Please let me think it over.

159
00:09:50,582 --> 00:09:53,882
Eiko, there's no need to think it over!

160
00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:56,682
Please leave, Mr. Fujie.

161
00:09:56,682 --> 00:09:58,182
How cruel

162
00:09:58,182 --> 00:10:01,582
to tell you to sacrifice yourself for his own convenience. Eiko...

163
00:10:01,582 --> 00:10:03,782
Come to think of it,

164
00:10:03,782 --> 00:10:06,282
it was after that, I realized that I had lost the pendant.

165
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,782
So, it's Mr. Fujie.

166
00:10:09,782 --> 00:10:13,682
But Mr. Fujie has the alibi of having been at Matsue Castle.

167
00:10:13,682 --> 00:10:16,582
His name was on the name list of the castle tower.

168
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:20,682
Let's go take a look at Matsue Castle, Mr. Mouri.

169
00:10:20,682 --> 00:10:24,682
Right, if the killer didn't try to frame Eiko up as the killer,

170
00:10:24,682 --> 00:10:28,282
Mr. Fukuma wouldn't have had to steal the sword, too!

171
00:10:35,782 --> 00:10:40,582
This distinct way of writing is unmistakably Mr. Fujie's writing.

172
00:10:40,582 --> 00:10:42,782
Judging from what's written before and after his signature,

173
00:10:42,782 --> 00:10:45,682
13:05 doesn't seem to be a lie.

174
00:10:45,682 --> 00:10:47,482
I guess it was just a waste of time.

175
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:50,282
I just thought there may be a possibility.

176
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,382
Which means, there's only one person left.

177
00:10:52,382 --> 00:10:53,582
Let's hurry back.

178
00:10:56,482 --> 00:10:57,782
Conan?

179
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:01,082
Okay! I'll catch up with you right away, so go ahead.

180
00:11:01,082 --> 00:11:02,982
Really? Right away, okay?

181
00:11:04,782 --> 00:11:07,182
Something is bothering me.

182
00:11:07,182 --> 00:11:08,982
The time here fits in too well.

183
00:11:13,282 --> 00:11:15,282
What is going on?

184
00:11:15,282 --> 00:11:18,182
Logging in the time suddenly started from yesterday?

185
00:11:18,182 --> 00:11:21,282
Hey, will you lend me your eraser?

186
00:11:21,282 --> 00:11:23,782
I can't seem to do it well.

187
00:11:23,782 --> 00:11:26,682
If written in a pencil, it could be erased.

188
00:11:26,682 --> 00:11:29,382
But this, you can't.

189
00:11:29,382 --> 00:11:30,982
No, maybe...

190
00:11:32,982 --> 00:11:35,482
Hey, will you please lend me your eraser?

191
00:11:37,382 --> 00:11:39,282
Hey, Ran! Hurry up!

192
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,082
Yep! Wait!

193
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:43,082
Conan's not here yet!

194
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:45,182
Not that brat again.

195
00:11:45,182 --> 00:11:47,182
Wait, Pops!

196
00:11:47,182 --> 00:11:48,282
We're leaving you behind!

197
00:11:50,382 --> 00:11:51,782
Yes, this is Yamane.

198
00:11:51,782 --> 00:11:52,782
What?

199
00:11:52,782 --> 00:11:55,382
Yeah, okay.

200
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:58,082
Mr. Ishitobi couldn't have committed the crime.

201
00:11:58,082 --> 00:11:59,682
Yesterday, a little after noon time,

202
00:11:59,682 --> 00:12:01,282
in the suburbs of Izumo,

203
00:12:01,282 --> 00:12:05,682
there was a hit and run accident around 13:00.

204
00:12:05,682 --> 00:12:09,182
At about the same time, Mr. Wanibuchi was killed in Inome Cave.

205
00:12:09,182 --> 00:12:10,382
And?

206
00:12:10,382 --> 00:12:15,282
The driver was finally found through eye-witness reports

207
00:12:15,282 --> 00:12:17,382
and just arrested.

208
00:12:17,382 --> 00:12:19,282
It is Mr. Ishitobi.

209
00:12:19,282 --> 00:12:20,382
What?

210
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,082
I get it.

211
00:12:23,082 --> 00:12:27,782
He wasn't jittery because he killed Mr. Wanibuchi,

212
00:12:27,782 --> 00:12:30,582
but because he was afraid we would find out about his hit-and-run case.

213
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:33,582
But if so, what about this case?

214
00:12:33,582 --> 00:12:36,182
It's not Mr. Fukuma or Ms. Esumi.

215
00:12:36,182 --> 00:12:38,782
Mr. Fujie has a definite alibi

216
00:12:38,782 --> 00:12:42,282
and the possibility of Mr. Ishitobi being the suspect is gone.

217
00:12:42,282 --> 00:12:45,182
All the suspects are innocent.

218
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:46,282
Right.

219
00:12:48,182 --> 00:12:49,882
Mr. Mouri!

220
00:12:49,882 --> 00:12:51,782
Dad, are you all right?

221
00:12:51,782 --> 00:12:54,382
So we're back where we started.

222
00:12:54,382 --> 00:12:55,682
Pops.

223
00:13:09,682 --> 00:13:11,882
Yes, I'm Fujie.

224
00:13:11,882 --> 00:13:15,382
This is Mouri, I'd like to see you.

225
00:13:15,382 --> 00:13:17,982
I'll leave the time and place up to you.

226
00:13:17,982 --> 00:13:20,582
I'll tell you the reason when I see you in person.

227
00:13:23,882 --> 00:13:25,382
Yes, Mouri here.

228
00:13:25,382 --> 00:13:28,182
This is Fujie. I have something I want to talk to you about.

229
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,382
You want to talk to me?

230
00:13:30,382 --> 00:13:32,882
I'll be waiting for you at Hinomisaki.

231
00:13:40,126 --> 00:13:43,626
What a magnificent lighthouse it is!

232
00:13:43,626 --> 00:13:44,626
Yes.

233
00:13:44,626 --> 00:13:49,426
It's 43.65 meters and is said to be tallest in Japan.

234
00:13:49,426 --> 00:13:51,326
What a beautiful lighthouse!

235
00:13:51,326 --> 00:13:57,026
It was built in Meiji 36 or 1903.

236
00:13:57,026 --> 00:13:59,926
So it's been here for over 100 years.

237
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:00,926
100 years.

238
00:14:02,126 --> 00:14:04,926
And he said to wait for him at Hinomisaki, but where?

239
00:14:04,926 --> 00:14:06,426
That's right.

240
00:14:06,426 --> 00:14:09,626
At this time, the lighthouse is already closed,

241
00:14:09,626 --> 00:14:11,926
so it must be that observatory up ahead.

242
00:14:11,926 --> 00:14:13,026
Let's go.

243
00:14:13,026 --> 00:14:14,026
Yes.

244
00:14:14,026 --> 00:14:15,526
What could he want to talk to me about?

245
00:14:22,726 --> 00:14:25,426
Mr. Fujie, thank you for waiting.

246
00:14:25,426 --> 00:14:27,126
What did you want to talk to me about?

247
00:14:27,126 --> 00:14:29,226
Aren't you the one who asked me to come?

248
00:14:32,226 --> 00:14:34,326
Please, may I meet someone nice?

249
00:14:34,326 --> 00:14:36,526
He's here! The Sleeping Kogoro!

250
00:14:36,526 --> 00:14:38,226
Sleeping Kogoro?

251
00:14:38,226 --> 00:14:39,726
So this is the rumoured...

252
00:14:44,826 --> 00:14:50,026
Mr. Fujie, you analogized Mr. Wanibuchi to the Eight-forked serpent.

253
00:14:50,026 --> 00:14:53,426
His name means crocodile, but his character is like that of a snake.

254
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:56,526
A monster that swallows up whatever it targets as prey.

255
00:14:56,526 --> 00:14:59,326
Yes, he's just like the Eight-forked serpent.

256
00:14:59,326 --> 00:15:05,326
It's true that Mr. Wanibuchi may have been a hated existence.

257
00:15:05,326 --> 00:15:09,926
But that doesn't mean it's okay to kill him, Mr. Fujie.

258
00:15:11,626 --> 00:15:14,426
What a thing to say.

259
00:15:14,426 --> 00:15:16,926
Is it about that again, Mr. Mouri?

260
00:15:16,926 --> 00:15:18,726
That's right, Mr. Mouri.

261
00:15:18,726 --> 00:15:24,026
You even confirmed his alibi at Matsue Castle yourself!

262
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:26,526
That was a trick.

263
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,426
A trick?

264
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:30,526
You thought of killing Mr. Wanibuchi

265
00:15:30,526 --> 00:15:34,826
when you went to Eiko's house several days ago, isn't that right?

266
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:40,826
You pleaded with Eiko, asking her to marry Mr. Wanibuchi

267
00:15:40,826 --> 00:15:45,426
and to ask him to quit taking over your wedding hall.

268
00:15:45,426 --> 00:15:51,326
But of course, the selfish plea was not heard.

269
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:52,726
And in your grief...

270
00:15:55,226 --> 00:15:58,826
You happened to pick up something you didn't expect to.

271
00:16:03,826 --> 00:16:05,826
A thought flashed through your mind.

272
00:16:05,826 --> 00:16:10,726
You made two calls the day before yesterday, didn't you?

273
00:16:10,726 --> 00:16:13,026
One was to Mr. Wanibuchi.

274
00:16:13,026 --> 00:16:15,026
It went something like this.

275
00:16:15,026 --> 00:16:18,626
I'll give you a great idea on how to make Ms. Eiko Esumi your very own.

276
00:16:18,626 --> 00:16:21,426
It's best for both of us to meet where there aren't many people.

277
00:16:21,426 --> 00:16:25,226
I'll see you at Inome tomorrow at 13:00 then.

278
00:16:25,226 --> 00:16:27,126
Your other call was to Eiko.

279
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:28,826
You pretended to be Mr. Wanibuchi.

280
00:16:29,826 --> 00:16:31,126
I want to see you tomorrow,

281
00:16:31,126 --> 00:16:33,926
please come to Inome at 13:30 tomorrow.

282
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,826
That phone call wasn't from Mr. Wanibuchi?

283
00:16:36,826 --> 00:16:39,026
He used Mr. Wanibuchi's tone of voice.

284
00:16:39,026 --> 00:16:41,426
Come to think of it, he said he had a cold.

285
00:16:41,426 --> 00:16:42,826
His voice was not like always.

286
00:16:42,826 --> 00:16:46,926
13:00 and 13:30, you designated different time

287
00:16:46,926 --> 00:16:51,926
because you didn't want Eiko to witness you killing Mr. Wanibuchi.

288
00:16:51,926 --> 00:16:55,026
And yesterday at 13:00,

289
00:16:55,026 --> 00:16:56,626
you carried out your scheme.

290
00:16:59,326 --> 00:17:05,026
Mr. Wanibuchi's wristwatch stopping at 13:05 was not what you planned,

291
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:08,926
but you had no choice but to carry out what you did.

292
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:12,226
So you sped over to Matsue Castle by car

293
00:17:12,226 --> 00:17:17,226
to log your name in on the name list and establish your alibi.

294
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:20,326
It would be impossible to log in from that time, Mr. Mouri.

295
00:17:20,326 --> 00:17:22,026
No matter how fast you drive there by car,

296
00:17:22,026 --> 00:17:24,226
you can get to Matsue Castle only after 14:00!

297
00:17:24,226 --> 00:17:25,926
It's not impossible.

298
00:17:25,926 --> 00:17:30,226
You went to Matsue Castle twice yesterday, didn't you?

299
00:17:30,226 --> 00:17:31,226
Twice?

300
00:17:31,226 --> 00:17:35,026
First, it was early in the morning, in order to set up the trick.

301
00:18:02,126 --> 00:18:06,626
You used an alias and logged in your name and the time

302
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:09,626
and at the same time you switched the pens.

303
00:18:09,626 --> 00:18:11,626
Switched the pens?

304
00:18:11,626 --> 00:18:14,526
You switched the pen to one you could erase using an eraser.

305
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:18,826
After killing Mr. Wanibuchi, you went back to Matsue Castle again

306
00:18:18,826 --> 00:18:22,326
and looked for a random log in around 13:00.

307
00:18:35,826 --> 00:18:40,726
So the very moment that Mr. Wanibuchi was killed,

308
00:18:40,726 --> 00:18:43,026
your alibi that you were at Matsue Castle,

309
00:18:43,026 --> 00:18:46,226
an hour away from the murder site was established.

310
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:48,526
It was a false alibi.

311
00:18:48,526 --> 00:18:51,426
It can easily be proven if you try it out.

312
00:18:51,426 --> 00:18:53,726
There are ball pens that can be erased using erasers.

313
00:18:55,626 --> 00:18:57,326
When you think about it,

314
00:18:57,326 --> 00:18:58,426
when logging in on name lists like these,

315
00:18:58,426 --> 00:19:01,626
the name, address and date are written,

316
00:19:01,626 --> 00:19:03,626
but the time is usually not written.

317
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:05,326
The fact is, nobody was writing in the time

318
00:19:05,326 --> 00:19:07,026
until the day before yesterday.

319
00:19:07,026 --> 00:19:08,526
However, yesterday,

320
00:19:08,526 --> 00:19:10,826
since the first person wrote in the time,

321
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:14,026
everyone started logging in the same way.

322
00:19:14,026 --> 00:19:16,126
If the first person writes something in a certain way,

323
00:19:16,126 --> 00:19:19,026
everyone who follows thinks that it is to be done this way

324
00:19:19,026 --> 00:19:23,126
and follows the first pattern without hesitation.

325
00:19:23,126 --> 00:19:26,426
You used this behaviour of people to carry out your trick.

326
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:29,226
How about it, Mr. Fujie?

327
00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:31,726
What proof do you have

328
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:34,426
that I am the first one who logged in yesterday morning?

329
00:19:34,426 --> 00:19:37,826
The name Icihiro Yamada sure sounds like an alias,

330
00:19:37,826 --> 00:19:41,126
but the problem is the address, Naruse-shi, Tokyo.

331
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:42,926
Naruse-shi, Tokyo?

332
00:19:42,926 --> 00:19:46,926
So what makes you say that I wrote it?

333
00:19:46,926 --> 00:19:49,426
Why is Naruse-shi a problem?

334
00:19:49,426 --> 00:19:54,526
Mr. Fujie, you used to live in Tokyo during your university days, right?

335
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,226
Wanibuchi was an underclassman of mine

336
00:19:57,226 --> 00:19:59,726
of Teito University economics department in Tokyo.

337
00:19:59,726 --> 00:20:02,226
I confirmed and found out

338
00:20:02,226 --> 00:20:05,326
that the dormitory that you lived in four years ago

339
00:20:05,326 --> 00:20:07,326
was located in Naruse-shi.

340
00:20:07,326 --> 00:20:09,026
That only shows that there is a point of contact.

341
00:20:09,026 --> 00:20:11,426
But that's no answer.

342
00:20:11,426 --> 00:20:14,426
It could be that a person by the name of Ichiro Yamada

343
00:20:14,426 --> 00:20:17,026
who actually came and wrote it, right?

344
00:20:17,026 --> 00:20:19,026
That's not possible,

345
00:20:19,026 --> 00:20:22,226
because a place called Naruse-shi does not exist in Tokyo anymore.

346
00:20:22,226 --> 00:20:23,226
What?

347
00:20:23,226 --> 00:20:25,626
It merged with Haido-cho that is next to it,

348
00:20:25,626 --> 00:20:28,826
and the name Naruse-shi is gone since a year ago.

349
00:20:30,326 --> 00:20:33,726
You didn't know until now, did you?

350
00:20:36,726 --> 00:20:41,626
I see. Naruse-shi doesn't exist anymore.

351
00:20:41,626 --> 00:20:44,226
Mr. Mouri, the fact is back then,

352
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:45,826
I thought I was doomed already.

353
00:20:45,826 --> 00:20:47,726
I'm Mouri.

354
00:20:47,726 --> 00:20:50,126
That famed detective?

355
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:55,026
I figured that you'd disclosed the truth in time.

356
00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:56,326
It's just as I thought after all.

357
00:21:07,126 --> 00:21:09,026
How beautiful.

358
00:21:09,026 --> 00:21:13,426
I love the sunset that is viewed from Hinomisaki.

359
00:21:13,426 --> 00:21:15,726
I won't be able to see it for some time now.

360
00:21:15,726 --> 00:21:18,826
I wanted to take a good look at it so I wouldn't forget it.

361
00:21:23,726 --> 00:21:26,526
I know how selfish I am.

362
00:21:26,526 --> 00:21:28,126
Despite knowing this,

363
00:21:28,126 --> 00:21:32,726
I didn't want Wanibuchi to take over my precious business.

364
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:35,926
I didn't want the monster to swallow it.

365
00:21:35,926 --> 00:21:37,626
I was desperate.

366
00:21:37,626 --> 00:21:39,326
I know.

367
00:21:39,326 --> 00:21:41,126
-Fukuma. -Yes?

368
00:21:41,126 --> 00:21:43,526
Be sure you protect Eiko.

369
00:21:43,526 --> 00:21:46,326
Who knows what monster would appear again in the future.

370
00:21:47,826 --> 00:21:49,226
I will.

371
00:21:52,526 --> 00:21:54,826
What a beautiful sunset!

372
00:21:54,826 --> 00:21:56,226
Conan!

373
00:21:56,226 --> 00:21:58,826
Where were you this whole time?

374
00:21:58,826 --> 00:22:01,426
Hey, I hope things work out for the two.

375
00:22:01,426 --> 00:22:03,226
I'm sure they'll work out just fine.

376
00:22:03,226 --> 00:22:06,126
After all, they were born in the land where the God of matchmaking resides.

377
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:37,026
There!

378
00:23:40,826 --> 00:23:43,526
I'm not going back to Tokyo until the coin makes it in there!

379
00:23:43,526 --> 00:23:45,326
This time for sure! There!

380
00:23:46,826 --> 00:23:47,826
I did it!

381
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:48,826
No way.

382
00:23:51,326 --> 00:23:54,126
No! Oh, no!

383
00:23:54,126 --> 00:23:55,526
Dad.

384
00:23:55,526 --> 00:23:56,726
Hey, hey.

385
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:59,726
I don't think it's cool to interfere with other people's wishes.

386
00:24:31,994 --> 00:24:34,194
Next Conan's Hint:

387
00:24:34,194 --> 00:24:36,494
"The promise of 10 years later"

388
00:24:36,494 --> 00:24:37,794
Next is the love story of you-know-who.

389
00:24:37,794 --> 00:24:39,294
It's not that way with Shinichi and me anymore.

390
00:24:39,294 --> 00:24:40,494
No, it's not about you, Ran.

391
00:24:40,494 --> 00:24:41,098
What?
