1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,490
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,290
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,090
Today, we're on the set of a drama.

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,090
The members of the cast are human, too!

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,690
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,590
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,690
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,230
Good evening, everyone.

9
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,230
I am Detective Kogoro Mouri.

10
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,230
The stage for today is this remote western style building.

11
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,430
A mystery entangled with love and hate.

12
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,030
The focal point of this case is "colour".

13
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,130
When people go shopping,

14
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:26,130
they tend to unconsciously select the colour they like...

15
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,130
Even at the scene of a crime.

16
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,430
Let's meet again at the end of the show.

17
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,630
This was Kogoro Mouri.

18
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,930
Okay, cut!

19
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,730
Fantastic! Mr. Mouri, you were just great.

20
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,030
Dad, you were really awesome.

21
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,430
Oh, really?

22
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,830
You could've cut out that wink at the end of the scene, though.

23
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:03,330
"Invisible Suspect (Part 1)"

24
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,830
Well, thank you very much. You were really a great help!

25
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,630
The popular actor who always does the opening prologue for this drama

26
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,030
caught a nasty cold.

27
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,930
You don't have to use me just as a pinch-hitter,

28
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,230
do feel free to call on me anytime!

29
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,330
If it's okay with you, I don't mind acting

30
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,130
in this detective drama as a special guest or something either.

31
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,530
Well, not really.

32
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,730
That's impossible, Mr. Detective.

33
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,430
Because in this story...

34
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,930
There are only the widowed mistress, her daughter the shrew,

35
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,730
their decrepit butler...

36
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,330
"Yoshiki Kazami (28)" -and aside from the daughter's murdered husband

37
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,830
and my role as a detective, there are only these five characters.

38
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,830
Hey, what's with that shrew bit?

39
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,230
"Kasumi Namihara (26)" -I'm supposed to be a character

40
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,430
that slightly like flashy things. That's about all, isn't it?

41
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,830
The character turns out a shrew because you're the one playing the role.

42
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,630
What did you just say?

43
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,930
By the way, Kazami,

44
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,330
"Akira Nagumo (60)" -I didn't like you remark, "decrepit" either.

45
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,630
I just turned 60.

46
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,330
I wasn't referring to your age.

47
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,330
I meant that your acting is decrepit.

48
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,930
What?

49
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,430
I hear that you were a great actor some time in the past, though.

50
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,330
Now, now.

51
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:22,230
Cool it, Dad.

52
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,230
"Nobuharu Nagumo (31)" -Let's not quarrel just before shooting the drama.

53
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,830
Mr. Kazami, please calm down.

54
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,730
Ms. Ujo sure is late, though.

55
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,230
Are you referring to that Ms. Ujo...

56
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:40,030
The one who used to be the number one comforting actress, Ruri Ujo?

57
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,630
Huh? Yes.

58
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,730
You mean, I get to see Ms. Ujo in person?

59
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,930
Huh? Get to see her in person?

60
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,630
She's the one who named you to substitute to do the opening prologue.

61
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,730
What?

62
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,630
I don't know if she's some former healer type actress...

63
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,430
I sure wouldn't want to be healed by an old maid like her.

64
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,730
Oh, my. I wouldn't want that either.

65
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,130
You're no more than a failure of an idol kid

66
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,330
"Ruri Ujo (37)" -who smells like piss.

67
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,130
You're really her!

68
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,830
You're even prettier than on TV!

69
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,130
Well, hello.

70
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,530
How do you do? I'm Kogoro Mouri.

71
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,030
I hear that you're the one who named me to take this job?

72
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,230
I don't think it's the fist time we're meeting, is it?

73
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,530
Really? Have we met somewhere before?

74
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,730
Oh, come on.

75
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,030
Doesn't this mole under my lips remind you either?

76
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,930
Kogoro!

77
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,730
Mole?

78
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:52,530
Ruri Doigaki?

79
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,330
Bull's eye!

80
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,930
Rurippe? Long time no see!

81
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,030
You can say that again!

82
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,730
We haven't seen each other since junior high school!

83
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:04,530
Huh? Don't tell me they know each other?

84
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,730
No kidding.

85
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,930
I had no idea whatsoever!

86
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,630
Your last name is different, too.

87
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,930
And besides, back then you were wearing glasses with super thick lens.

88
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,830
Well? I turned out to be pretty foxy, don't you think?

89
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,530
You did, you sure did.

90
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,130
But why haven't you gotten married yet?

91
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,230
Being as beautiful as you are,

92
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,630
I'm sure you've got a multitude of guys to pick from.

93
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,930
Don't be silly.

94
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,430
It's because one-sidedly in love with you all these years, why else?

95
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,630
Please stop joking with him.

96
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,130
Because he's bound to take you seriously.

97
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,630
Oh, my. Who is she?

98
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,030
She is just some girl who lives in the neighborhood.

99
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,930
I am his daughter, Ran!

100
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,530
Oh, my. Then, she's Eri's daughter?

101
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,630
Do you know my mother?

102
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,030
Yes.

103
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:56,530
I was with her all the way from kindergarten to junior high school.

104
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,930
But it still is sure a mystery.

105
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:03,130
As to why Eri, the smartest girl in school

106
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:06,030
and Kogoro, the most mischievous boy

107
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,030
fell so lovey-dovey in love as they did

108
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,530
and finally ended up marrying each other.

109
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,530
Very true.

110
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,830
You mean they were in love with each other for that long?

111
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,730
Hey...

112
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,230
Yes!

113
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,530
Eri who always kept her cool would really get upset

114
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,030
and go all out when her counterpart was Kogoro!

115
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:29,230
So, we all took it to be a lover's quarrel.

116
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,730
And they were constantly being teased.

117
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,530
They're still quarreling to this day.

118
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,130
What a surprise though.

119
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,930
That the Kogoro that I used to know is now a renown detective.

120
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,030
Okay, let's start camera rehearsal for scene 134!

121
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,430
Ready, start!

122
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,730
The corpse in front of the fireplace is covered with a gray tablecloth.

123
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:01,730
And the victim's black coat is hanging on over the chair of that table.

124
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,130
Near the corpse, on the floor

125
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,930
is the murder weapon,

126
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,430
a golf club with a white head cover on it.

127
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,130
I guess we can say that the case has already been solved.

128
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,630
Don't keep us in suspense, just spit it out!

129
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,930
Come on, tell us who it is.

130
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,230
Who on earth is the killer?

131
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:28,930
I was actually supposed to explain what went on, but...

132
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,130
Hey.

133
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,030
There's no such dialogue in the script.

134
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,030
Tonight, Detective Mouri...

135
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,130
Let's have you solve the case.

136
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,430
Huh?

137
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:42,930
First, tell us why the killer covered the corpse with a tablecloth.

138
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,430
That's probably because...

139
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,630
Because the killer loved the victim.

140
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,430
That's why the killer didn't want to leave the corpse there

141
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,330
without doing anything about it.

142
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,530
But the coat was on the chair, you know.

143
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,030
Why did the killer go to the trouble of using the tablecloth?

144
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,030
The reason is...

145
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:07,130
because the gray tablecloth seemed to be warmer than the black coat.

146
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,130
Huh?

147
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,330
Hey, don't tell me that you're serious about what you just said.

148
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,630
Give me a break.

149
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,930
You were dropping hints in the opening prologue yourself.

150
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,930
Why does gray seem warmer than black?

151
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,230
Huh? Don't you think so?

152
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,730
Your friend's not all that great either, is he?

153
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,430
Dad, talk seriously.

154
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,530
Come on. Get serious, Kogoro!

155
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:38,030
No way! This is as far as this old man goes.

156
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,030
Gosh.

157
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,630
He has appeared!

158
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,830
The Sleeping Kogoro!

159
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,730
Excuse me.

160
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,930
Since the deduction was so simple,

161
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,530
I sort of felt like playing a bit of a prank.

162
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,830
What?

163
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,830
It wasn't that the killer

164
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,730
wanted to cover the corpse with the gray tablecloth,

165
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,130
the killer didn't want to cover the corpse with the black coat.

166
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,330
Because the killer likes the colour black.

167
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:11,830
It's most likely that the killer subconsciously thought

168
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,230
that using a favorite colour at the scene of the murder

169
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,730
may bring on suspicion.

170
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,030
See, please take a good look at the golf bag

171
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,630
that is left standing against the fireplace.

172
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:28,330
Only the club with the black head cover is sticking out, right?

173
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,630
This is because the killer was going to use the club with the black cover

174
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,230
as the murder weapon,

175
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,930
but decided against it while pulling it out.

176
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,030
It's an evidence that the killer decided to use the white ones instead.

177
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,730
Furthermore, taking into consideration that the furniture in this room

178
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,930
as well as the curtains are all coordinated with the colour black,

179
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,730
shows that the owner of this house

180
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,430
that is the killer is wearing a black dress.

181
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,130
Rurippe, it's the role you're playing,

182
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,130
who is the mistress of this house.

183
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,530
Don't you agree?

184
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,930
Amazing! Just as expected of the Sleeping Kogoro.

185
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,130
He hit the bull's eye.

186
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,430
Just as rumor has it, you didn't let us down, Kogoro.

187
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,230
Gosh. Why didn't you start off seriously to begin with?

188
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,330
The real thing is distinguished after all.

189
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,130
Corpses aren't supposed to move!

190
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,330
Hey!

191
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,330
Hey! Just what do you think you're doing?

192
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,530
Are you okay, Nobuharu?

193
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,930
Kasumi?

194
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:36,230
So, after that playwright, you're switching over to that guy?

195
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,230
Huh?

196
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,230
This was still supposed to be off the records, right?

197
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,830
Hey, you! Enough is enough!

198
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:47,830
Are you sure want to talk to me like that, old fart?

199
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:53,930
I know about you secretly seeing a young lover night after night.

200
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:54,930
What?

201
00:11:54,930 --> 00:12:00,030
I'm not really sure who or where that lady is yet,

202
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,830
but I sort of have an idea.

203
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,730
I do have an idea.

204
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,430
Let me go!

205
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,430
What's with that look on your faces, you guys?

206
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,830
I could make this drama go down the drain

207
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,430
if you want it that way, you know?

208
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,330
What a bummer.

209
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,930
I'm going to go take a nap in the room until I feel more up to it,

210
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,330
so go ahead and film the scenes that I don't appear in.

211
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,610
What's with that guy?

212
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,710
He's the oldest son of the owner of the newspaper agency

213
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,510
that is the main sponsor for this drama.

214
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,110
I see.

215
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,110
That's why he knows so much of what's going on behind the scenes.

216
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,410
Yes.

217
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,710
And to make things worse, his obnoxious character

218
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,710
seems to be getting high ratings among the viewers.

219
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,110
To be honest, I really don't want to act on a program

220
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,210
where he's the star of the show, but I have no choice.

221
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,810
Because my office says I should since the rating is high.

222
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,610
Well, it doesn't bother me much

223
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,010
now that I got to see you after so long, Kogoro.

224
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:17,310
Okay. Why don't we take a 30 minute break?

225
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,310
And start shooting again after refreshing our feelings a bit!

226
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,610
Yes, sir...

227
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:22,810
What?

228
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,210
Fighting over sauce and shoyu?

229
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,410
You mean Mom and Dad?

230
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,510
That's right.

231
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,110
They got into a great battle during home economics class

232
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,910
in elementary school over whether sauce or shoyu

233
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,510
should be used on sunny side up.

234
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,110
Eri insisted that sauce should be used

235
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,810
because sunny side up is a western style dish,

236
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,210
but Kogoro insisted that the Japanese should use shoyu.

237
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,710
It puzzles me even more.

238
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,010
So, why'd they get married?

239
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,510
But the order in which they ate what was made

240
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,610
was exactly the same,

241
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,810
so the entire class burst out laughing.

242
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:00,110
Next, they get into a fight saying, "Stop copying me!"

243
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,110
It's really hard to tell whether they get along or not.

244
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,710
Never mind about the past already.

245
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:09,410
No. Please tell me more about it!

246
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,610
Hey.

247
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:16,710
Huh? What is it?

248
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,110
Snow.

249
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,410
See, it's snowing.

250
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:30,010
They did say that it may snow today on the weather forecast.

251
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:33,410
Hey, why don't we all go outside and watch the snow?

252
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,210
But we've only got five minutes of break time left.

253
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,510
Who cares if it's only five minutes?

254
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,210
It's the first snowfall this year, you know!

255
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,410
I guess so.

256
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,010
Come on, let's hurry.

257
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:52,510
I love it when it snows after all.

258
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,110
Right, Conan?

259
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,110
What seems to be the matter?

260
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,610
I don't see Ruri around.

261
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,110
Huh?

262
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,910
Where's Ruri?

263
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,210
Huh?

264
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,410
I thought I came out together with her.

265
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,510
Rurippe?

266
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,710
Darn it!

267
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,010
Rurippe?

268
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,210
Rurippe?

269
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,510
Kogoro.

270
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,810
No good, his pupils are completely dilated.

271
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,610
He's already dead.

272
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,510
Ran, call the police.

273
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,810
Okay.

274
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,810
But who did it?

275
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,410
Who could've done something so ruthless like this?

276
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,410
Beats me.

277
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:58,710
He was the type to make enemies so...

278
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,610
But in cases like this

279
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,010
isn't the first one to be suspected

280
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,210
is the one who first found the body?

281
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,410
Huh?

282
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,910
No, I didn't do it.

283
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,510
When I came to this room,

284
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,910
he was already smeared with blood!

285
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,010
It's true. Please believe me, Kogoro.

286
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,610
Yes, I believe you.

287
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,110
We won't be fooled by your crying and all!

288
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:34,210
An actress' tears is one of her weapons.

289
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,110
Hey, Kasumi.

290
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,610
But if things go as is,

291
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,110
we may also be suspected of homicide, you know?

292
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,210
Everything will be fine. We'll be okay.

293
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:48,010
The victim is Mr. Yoshiki Kazami, age 28.

294
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,410
The cause of death is loss of blood due to damage

295
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,710
to the carotid artery.

296
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:56,910
He was probably attacked while asleep on this sofa here

297
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,510
and slashed in the throat or something.

298
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,210
The estimated time of death

299
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:05,910
is between 7:50 pm when the victim came here to take a nap

300
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:09,310
to the time he was found dead at 8:20 pm.

301
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,810
A period of 30 minutes.

302
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,110
I think it was shorter.

303
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:18,710
Because when we were looking around this house

304
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,910
and came into this room on the way, he was snoring away and sleeping.

305
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,210
Hey, Conan!

306
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:28,110
That was just around 8:00 pm. Isn't that right, Ran?

307
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,510
Yes. Because Dad looked at his watch

308
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,110
saying that he was fast asleep in 10 minutes.

309
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,810
Ran and Conan!

310
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,410
Which means that...

311
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,710
Mr. Mouri!

312
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,910
So, you're here after all.

313
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:50,110
Thank you for looking after my younger brother the other day.

314
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,710
Oh, no.

315
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,210
That was really no big deal.

316
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,610
Kogoro, do you know him?

317
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,210
Yes.

318
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,810
How do you do?

319
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:04,110
I'm Inspector Yokomizo from the Shizuoka Prefectural Police.

320
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,810
I've finally got to meet you, Mrs. Mouri!

321
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,010
Huh?

322
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,010
Am I wrong?

323
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,110
No.

324
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,810
Well, I guess you're wrong. But then again maybe not.

325
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,310
Wrong!

326
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,910
I'm only joking. It's a just a joke.

327
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:24,010
Huh? Don't tell me that you're...

328
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,810
Ruri Ujo, the actress?

329
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:28,810
Yes.

330
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,610
Huh? And you're...

331
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,610
You and you, too.

332
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,010
What's going on here?

333
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,610
Why are there so many actors and actresses here?

334
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,810
It's just as if you're shooting a drama or something here.

335
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:45,410
That's what we're doing here.

336
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,260
So, this is how it goes?

337
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,060
You're shooting a detective story here at this European style building

338
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,960
out in the rural side of Mountain Fuji

339
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,760
when a real homicide happened to occur.

340
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,660
So, this is indeed a case of the biter being bitten.

341
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,060
Well, I guess so.

342
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,660
And? In the 20 minutes after 8 pm,

343
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,160
when the murder is thought to have been committed,

344
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,860
the shooting was stopped so everyone could take a break.

345
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,260
And all you staff members stayed in groups of more than two people,

346
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,160
so all of you have an alibi.

347
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,360
The ones without an alibi are Ms. Ruri Ujo, who found the corpse

348
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,260
and each of the actors and actresses who went back

349
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,260
to their respective rooms to check the dialogue in the script.

350
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,460
Which is Ms. Kasumi Namihara.

351
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,560
Mr. Akira Nagumo,

352
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,060
and Mr. Nobuharu Nagumo,

353
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,460
the four of you.

354
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,760
Ms. Ujo.

355
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,660
Please explain how things were when you discovered the corpse.

356
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,760
Yes, sir.

357
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,660
Since we decided to take a break, Kogoro here...

358
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,560
No. Mr. Mouri and everybody else including myself

359
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,460
went looking around inside the building.

360
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,960
Then, we noticed that it began to snow.

361
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,360
So, we invited the staff to come along

362
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,660
and went outside to look at the snow.

363
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,460
Since the snow was so beautiful,

364
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,560
I wanted Mr. Kazami to take a look at it, too.

365
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,260
So, I came over to this room.

366
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,960
Besides, he was sulky

367
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,260
after going through what he did during the shooting, too.

368
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,760
But when I opened the door,

369
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,060
he was lying on the floor smeared with blood.

370
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,860
I thought he was joking and shook him,

371
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,060
but he didn't answer.

372
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,860
That's when I finally realized that he was dead and screamed.

373
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,460
I see.

374
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:28,860
So, the three of you heard her scream and ran over here.

375
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,960
Yes.

376
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,360
That's right.

377
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,360
Okay. Will the four of you

378
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,560
go to the other room and go through a body check?

379
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,260
Huh? Why?

380
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,560
We can't find it.

381
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,360
It isn't anywhere in this building.

382
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,860
We haven't found the approximately 10 centimeter long blade

383
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,360
that was used to slit Kazami's throat.

384
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,860
Inspector Yokomizo!

385
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,960
How about it?

386
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,760
Did you find the weapon?

387
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,860
Well, all four of them had nothing like that on them.

388
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,660
We also checked the staff's belongings,

389
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,260
and the other rooms from one end to the other.

390
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,960
But things that could've been used as the murder weapon

391
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,760
were only the knife in the kitchen,

392
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,760
a small knife for cutting fruit,

393
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,360
and a cutter knife that was found in the tool box of the staff.

394
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,160
We found no luminol reaction from any of those things.

395
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,660
All the victim had on him

396
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,760
was this pack of cigarettes, this lighter, and his wallet.

397
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,660
We're searching inside the drains

398
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,160
and around the building with a metal detector,

399
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,360
but we haven't got any report that anything was found yet.

400
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,560
Darn it.

401
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,060
Even though we've already found the golf club and coat

402
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,560
that the killer might have used to commit the murder...

403
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,360
why can't we find the murder weapon?

404
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,360
Moreover, the glove and the coat

405
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,060
are props that are used when filming dramas,

406
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,460
but it seems that nobody was in the room

407
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,060
where these things were during break time.

408
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:03,360
Which means that anybody could've taken it with considerable ease.

409
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,360
And? Where are the four suspects now?

410
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,660
I have them waiting in the room together with Mr. Mouri.

411
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,660
If the killer is among them,

412
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,760
it would be impossible to get rid of the murder weapon

413
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,160
by taking it somewhere far away in such a short time.

414
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,860
And yet, why?

415
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,460
Why can't the murder weapon be found?

416
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,640
Next Conan's Hint:

417
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,540
"Lighter"
