1
00:00:22,163 --> 00:00:23,963
Prize contest, lucky draw and lottery.

2
00:00:23,963 --> 00:00:25,563
The lucky man who's envied by all.

3
00:00:25,563 --> 00:00:27,563
Something's bound to happen if you're too lucky.

4
00:00:27,563 --> 00:00:29,063
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:30,863
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:30,863 --> 00:00:32,863
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:01,814 --> 00:02:03,814
"First prize" -Red for the first prize!

8
00:02:03,814 --> 00:02:05,614
"Second prize" -Blue for the second prize!

9
00:02:05,614 --> 00:02:08,314
"Third prize" -Yellow for the third prize!

10
00:02:08,314 --> 00:02:10,314
Please, at least the third prize.

11
00:02:10,314 --> 00:02:12,014
Give me the yellow!

12
00:02:12,014 --> 00:02:13,014
Come on!

13
00:02:23,214 --> 00:02:25,114
White.

14
00:02:25,114 --> 00:02:27,814
You won a pack of tissues!

15
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:28,914
Here you go!

16
00:02:31,214 --> 00:02:34,314
Come on! Forget about it, Genta!

17
00:02:34,314 --> 00:02:36,814
Things can't always go the way you want.

18
00:02:36,814 --> 00:02:38,614
That's right, Genta.

19
00:02:38,614 --> 00:02:39,614
Yeah, but...

20
00:02:39,614 --> 00:02:41,214
"Third prize" -I really wanted the prize.

21
00:02:41,214 --> 00:02:43,714
At least the third prize. That digital camera.

22
00:02:47,114 --> 00:02:49,114
Here goes the winner! The third prize!

23
00:02:49,114 --> 00:02:50,814
Oh, he's.

24
00:02:50,814 --> 00:02:54,714
"Makoto Owada (30)" -Dr. Owada, isn't he?

25
00:02:54,714 --> 00:02:56,914
He won a prize again.

26
00:02:56,914 --> 00:02:58,714
So you know him?

27
00:02:58,714 --> 00:03:01,314
He is the doctor at Beika Hospital.

28
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,314
He's a doctor!

29
00:03:03,314 --> 00:03:05,514
No, he is a great doctor.

30
00:03:05,514 --> 00:03:08,314
He's enthusiastic and talented.

31
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:10,114
He's also kind to everybody too.

32
00:03:10,114 --> 00:03:12,314
Who would say bad about him?

33
00:03:12,314 --> 00:03:13,714
Nobody.

34
00:03:13,714 --> 00:03:14,814
Right.

35
00:03:14,814 --> 00:03:16,914
Why don't you see that doctor, Conan?

36
00:03:16,914 --> 00:03:18,114
Yeah, you should!

37
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:21,114
It's okay! I'm healthy.

38
00:03:21,114 --> 00:03:22,814
Ayumi?

39
00:03:22,814 --> 00:03:25,514
You said he won a prize again.

40
00:03:25,514 --> 00:03:26,814
Yeah.

41
00:03:26,814 --> 00:03:30,014
I think it was two week ago...

42
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:35,314
So beautiful!

43
00:03:36,614 --> 00:03:39,114
"Super scratch lottery"

44
00:03:39,114 --> 00:03:41,614
Dr. Owada won the lottery ticket.

45
00:03:43,414 --> 00:03:45,614
Really? The lottery ticket too?

46
00:03:45,614 --> 00:03:46,914
He must be lucky.

47
00:03:46,914 --> 00:03:48,914
He's too lucky!

48
00:03:48,914 --> 00:03:51,714
I think my mom told me that

49
00:03:51,714 --> 00:03:56,114
last week he won Union Beer lucky draw too.

50
00:03:56,114 --> 00:03:58,914
I heard he's got a year supply of beer.

51
00:03:58,914 --> 00:04:01,114
So within a week,

52
00:04:01,114 --> 00:04:03,514
Dr. Owada has won money from lottery ticket, Union Beer,

53
00:04:03,514 --> 00:04:07,314
and a digital camera.

54
00:04:10,414 --> 00:04:12,914
"Mouri Detective Agency" -I'm home!

55
00:04:12,914 --> 00:04:14,114
Yeah!

56
00:04:15,414 --> 00:04:18,114
I got beer supply for a year!

57
00:04:19,514 --> 00:04:22,514
Come on, Union Beer. You can't do this!

58
00:04:24,414 --> 00:04:27,814
Pops, what happened to Union Beer?

59
00:04:27,814 --> 00:04:30,614
I thought I got this letter because I won,

60
00:04:30,614 --> 00:04:33,514
but it was actually a letter of apology

61
00:04:33,514 --> 00:04:35,014
that the drawing had been postponed until next month.

62
00:04:35,014 --> 00:04:36,214
Gosh!

63
00:04:36,214 --> 00:04:38,414
The drawing had been postponed?

64
00:04:38,414 --> 00:04:39,514
It's true!

65
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:43,214
But then, what did Dr. Owada win?

66
00:04:45,914 --> 00:04:51,214
"The Lucky Man's Suspense"

67
00:04:51,414 --> 00:04:54,514
Dr. Owada didn't win the prize?

68
00:04:54,514 --> 00:04:56,914
Yeah, it cannot be true.

69
00:04:56,914 --> 00:05:00,614
Because they haven't done the drawing yet.

70
00:05:00,614 --> 00:05:02,114
You're right.

71
00:05:02,114 --> 00:05:04,714
If this is what's really happening,

72
00:05:04,714 --> 00:05:06,614
then the rest of the prizes cannot be real too.

73
00:05:06,614 --> 00:05:07,914
What do you mean the other prizes?

74
00:05:07,914 --> 00:05:10,814
But it's true that he won the lottery.

75
00:05:10,814 --> 00:05:13,314
I think it's also true that he won the lucky draw!

76
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:15,414
We saw it, right?

77
00:05:15,414 --> 00:05:16,814
Yes, I did.

78
00:05:16,814 --> 00:05:19,214
And you guys all saw it too.

79
00:05:19,214 --> 00:05:20,814
But not the exact moment.

80
00:05:25,114 --> 00:05:27,114
What? Cheating?

81
00:05:28,914 --> 00:05:30,414
Can you stay here?

82
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,014
Let's talk about it somewhere else.

83
00:05:39,114 --> 00:05:43,114
Okay, I admit that I cheated a bit.

84
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:47,914
All right, go ahead!

85
00:06:00,114 --> 00:06:02,314
Here goes the winner! The third prize!

86
00:06:05,314 --> 00:06:06,414
So it was.

87
00:06:06,414 --> 00:06:07,914
Cheating!

88
00:06:07,914 --> 00:06:09,014
It's not fair!

89
00:06:09,014 --> 00:06:10,214
Just as I thought.

90
00:06:10,214 --> 00:06:12,814
But the doctor doesn't know this!

91
00:06:12,814 --> 00:06:15,914
This was actually his wife's request.

92
00:06:15,914 --> 00:06:19,114
What? The doctor's wife's request, you said?

93
00:06:19,114 --> 00:06:21,014
Right. She asked me to give him

94
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,914
the third prize when he came over.

95
00:06:23,914 --> 00:06:27,014
She said she wanted to cheer him up

96
00:06:27,014 --> 00:06:29,514
since he had lost confidence as a doctor.

97
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:33,314
Since Dr. Owada saved my life before,

98
00:06:33,314 --> 00:06:35,614
so I wanted to help him too.

99
00:06:35,614 --> 00:06:38,014
So you did it to return the favor.

100
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:40,214
But cheating is still bad!

101
00:06:40,214 --> 00:06:44,014
That prize could've been won by somebody else.

102
00:06:44,014 --> 00:06:46,814
Well, actually the doctor's wife brought the camera,

103
00:06:46,814 --> 00:06:48,614
when she came over to the tent.

104
00:06:48,614 --> 00:06:51,214
What? She prepared it herself?

105
00:06:51,214 --> 00:06:54,914
So that means, Mrs. Owada gave you the digital camera she bought

106
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,414
and you gave it to Dr. Owada as prize, am I right?

107
00:06:58,414 --> 00:06:59,414
Yeah.

108
00:06:59,414 --> 00:07:02,514
Nobody was victim, even if it was a cheating.

109
00:07:02,514 --> 00:07:05,914
Then, this isn't a crime, is it?

110
00:07:07,014 --> 00:07:10,014
"Owada" -I asked him?

111
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:12,714
No, I never ask him to do that.

112
00:07:12,714 --> 00:07:15,614
But the guy said the doctor's wife came.

113
00:07:15,614 --> 00:07:18,714
First of all, my husband is doing pretty well at work.

114
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,914
He lost confidence as a doctor and depressed?

115
00:07:22,914 --> 00:07:25,414
No. It can't be!

116
00:07:25,414 --> 00:07:27,714
Why is it so different?

117
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:28,914
Yeah, it is.

118
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:30,914
It's weird.

119
00:07:30,914 --> 00:07:35,914
Oh, right. I heard that you won Union Beer. Is that true?

120
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,814
I heard there's been a rumor like that

121
00:07:37,814 --> 00:07:40,014
but that's not true either.

122
00:07:40,014 --> 00:07:42,914
Because neither of us can't drink.

123
00:07:42,914 --> 00:07:44,614
There's no reason for him to enter a lucky draw

124
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:46,514
for a one-year supply of beer.

125
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:49,314
-What? -He didn't even enter the lucky draw?

126
00:07:49,314 --> 00:07:51,114
Whether it's the lucky draw or the beer...

127
00:07:51,114 --> 00:07:54,214
I think somebody has mixed us up with someone with the same last name.

128
00:07:55,714 --> 00:07:57,114
-What's going on? -What's going on?

129
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:02,414
She really asked me, trust me!

130
00:08:02,414 --> 00:08:04,314
She was the doctor's wife!

131
00:08:04,314 --> 00:08:05,514
I'm not lying!

132
00:08:05,514 --> 00:08:09,414
She said she was Dr. Owada's wife from Beika Hospital.

133
00:08:09,414 --> 00:08:13,514
She was a tall, slim, beautiful woman.

134
00:08:13,514 --> 00:08:15,714
What's the point of telling you a lie?

135
00:08:15,714 --> 00:08:17,414
I have to go. I'm busy.

136
00:08:18,614 --> 00:08:20,714
She was a tall, slim.

137
00:08:20,714 --> 00:08:22,914
Beautiful woman.

138
00:08:24,214 --> 00:08:26,614
It can't be her.

139
00:08:26,614 --> 00:08:29,214
It seems we're getting somewhere.

140
00:08:29,214 --> 00:08:32,314
It seems to be true that Dr. Owada won the lottery.

141
00:08:32,314 --> 00:08:33,814
But the lucky draw was a setup.

142
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:38,814
The beer lucky draw is nothing but a baseless lie.

143
00:08:38,814 --> 00:08:40,414
This is the work of a woman

144
00:08:40,414 --> 00:08:44,114
who is tall, slim and beautiful

145
00:08:44,114 --> 00:08:47,314
and try to make everybody thinks that Dr. Owada is lucky.

146
00:08:47,314 --> 00:08:51,514
But what's the point of doing so anyway?

147
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:54,714
She even bought the prize for the lucky draw herself.

148
00:08:54,714 --> 00:08:56,414
That's it!

149
00:08:56,414 --> 00:08:58,914
What's waiting for her

150
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,514
after making the doctor a "super lucky man"?

151
00:09:03,414 --> 00:09:06,014
Here's your prize, a pack of tissue!

152
00:09:06,014 --> 00:09:07,814
There's gotta be something.

153
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,914
Some kind of reason to it.

154
00:09:09,914 --> 00:09:12,314
We never win a prize, do we?

155
00:09:12,314 --> 00:09:15,714
But you know, Dr. Owada at Beika Hospital.

156
00:09:15,714 --> 00:09:16,714
Yes, I heard!

157
00:09:16,714 --> 00:09:18,614
He won the third prize, right?

158
00:09:18,614 --> 00:09:21,214
He also won the Union Beer's drawing, right?

159
00:09:21,214 --> 00:09:25,814
Sounds like the doctor is sucking up fortune from us.

160
00:09:25,814 --> 00:09:28,814
Yeah, so somebody was saying that,

161
00:09:28,814 --> 00:09:30,514
too much luck can actually make other people envious

162
00:09:30,514 --> 00:09:34,214
and that could bring about misfortune on the doctor.

163
00:09:34,214 --> 00:09:35,614
Making others envious?

164
00:09:36,714 --> 00:09:40,014
That's true. Envy is a scary thing.

165
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:41,414
Yeah.

166
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,014
People envy others when they are too lucky.

167
00:09:45,114 --> 00:09:48,114
Maybe the purpose of that woman's action is...

168
00:09:48,114 --> 00:09:51,714
Dr. Owada is an amazing guy, right?

169
00:09:51,714 --> 00:09:53,414
Why are you asking that again?

170
00:09:53,414 --> 00:09:57,714
I told you, nobody says bad about him. Right?

171
00:09:57,714 --> 00:09:58,914
Yup!

172
00:09:58,914 --> 00:10:03,914
He's not a guy people hold a grudge against.

173
00:10:03,914 --> 00:10:06,714
Maybe that's why the woman has been acting that way.

174
00:10:06,714 --> 00:10:09,214
What's the matter, Conan?

175
00:10:09,214 --> 00:10:12,114
Maybe that woman

176
00:10:12,114 --> 00:10:15,014
is trying to make a forest.

177
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,414
-A forest? -A forest?

178
00:10:16,414 --> 00:10:18,814
What do you mean by a forest?

179
00:10:18,814 --> 00:10:20,214
So then...

180
00:10:20,214 --> 00:10:24,114
There should be many other lucky stories about Dr. Owada.

181
00:10:24,114 --> 00:10:25,714
There must be.

182
00:10:25,714 --> 00:10:27,614
Other lucky stories?

183
00:10:27,614 --> 00:10:31,914
Yeah, and also stories about people envying him.

184
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:34,014
Perhaps the tall, slim, beautiful woman

185
00:10:34,014 --> 00:10:37,314
is where all those stories are coming from.

186
00:10:37,314 --> 00:10:41,514
We're gonna go out separately to find out who this woman is.

187
00:10:41,514 --> 00:10:43,314
I'll do it by using some other route!

188
00:10:43,314 --> 00:10:45,114
What was that? All of a sudden?

189
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:48,314
If my deduction is correct,

190
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,314
then something is going to happen pretty soon.

191
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:02,525
He told me to find out who but where should I go?

192
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,025
"Beika Kindergarten" -You mean Dr. Owada at Beika Hospital?

193
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:07,425
Yeah!

194
00:11:07,425 --> 00:11:08,725
Owada?

195
00:11:08,725 --> 00:11:10,225
I heard he found tons of gold coins

196
00:11:10,225 --> 00:11:13,325
when he was digging a hole in his backyard!

197
00:11:13,325 --> 00:11:15,825
Really? Oh, my. He must be lucky.

198
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:18,425
It's not all good stories though.

199
00:11:18,425 --> 00:11:21,325
His tremendous luck is actually making many people envy him.

200
00:11:21,325 --> 00:11:23,325
Excuse me.

201
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:25,625
About that story, where did you hear about it?

202
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,625
About the people envying Dr. Owada!

203
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,425
"Osawa Fruit and Vegetables Store" -A hundred million yen!

204
00:11:30,425 --> 00:11:32,725
He found a big bag with a hundred million yen in it!

205
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,325
Dr. Owada did?

206
00:11:34,325 --> 00:11:37,225
I heard so, and when he returned the money to the owner,

207
00:11:37,225 --> 00:11:40,225
he received 5 million yen from the owner as a reward.

208
00:11:40,225 --> 00:11:42,325
He's a lucky guy, really.

209
00:11:42,325 --> 00:11:45,225
From who did you hear that story?

210
00:11:45,225 --> 00:11:48,225
It was one of our customers, I think.

211
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:50,925
Wasn't that a woman with a tall and slim body?

212
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:54,425
But why?

213
00:11:54,425 --> 00:11:56,625
-That's because... -I really don't know,

214
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,725
but I swear some terrible thing is about to happen for sure!

215
00:11:59,725 --> 00:12:02,325
"Beika Hospital" -A person who hates Dr. Owada?

216
00:12:02,325 --> 00:12:05,725
It's a woman, tall and slim.

217
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:10,325
I don't think there's anybody that hates Dr. Owada in this world.

218
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:13,425
Not only by the patients but also his co-workers.

219
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:16,225
Dr. Owada is loved by everybody.

220
00:12:16,225 --> 00:12:17,325
Thank you!

221
00:12:17,325 --> 00:12:18,625
Bye.

222
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,025
Good afternoon.

223
00:12:20,025 --> 00:12:21,325
Dr. Owada.

224
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:22,925
How are you feeling today?

225
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:24,225
I'm quite well, thank you.

226
00:12:24,225 --> 00:12:27,525
That's good! But take it easy, okay?

227
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:29,725
Thank you, doctor.

228
00:12:29,725 --> 00:12:31,325
Okay, take care.

229
00:12:31,325 --> 00:12:33,225
There's nothing in the hospital.

230
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:39,725
It hurts...

231
00:12:41,725 --> 00:12:45,125
Hiroaki, I told you not to run inside the hospital.

232
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,125
I'm sorry.

233
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,425
But I'm glad that you can run now.

234
00:12:49,425 --> 00:12:50,525
Yeah!

235
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,025
Having a fight with Dr. Owada?

236
00:12:59,025 --> 00:13:00,025
Yeah.

237
00:13:00,025 --> 00:13:03,825
Who would do such thing to that great doctor?

238
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,325
It was a woman, I was shocked!

239
00:13:06,325 --> 00:13:07,425
What?

240
00:13:09,325 --> 00:13:10,725
Excuse me, sir!

241
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:11,925
About what you just said,

242
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:14,825
a woman was having a fight with Dr. Owada?

243
00:13:14,825 --> 00:13:16,025
Yeah.

244
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:17,125
When?

245
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,325
It was about a month ago.

246
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,125
Mrs. Shiina...

247
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,025
Please calm down, Mrs. Shiina!

248
00:13:32,025 --> 00:13:34,625
Please, Mrs. Shiina.

249
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,925
So her name is Mrs. Shiina?

250
00:13:36,925 --> 00:13:39,725
She was tall and slim.

251
00:13:39,725 --> 00:13:41,825
That must be her!

252
00:13:41,825 --> 00:13:44,225
I think she was dressed in black.

253
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:45,425
Dressed in black.

254
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,925
It's me, I found her.

255
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:52,925
I found the woman!

256
00:13:58,325 --> 00:13:59,525
Mitsuhiko.

257
00:13:59,525 --> 00:14:02,425
Conan, she's the one on the right.

258
00:14:05,825 --> 00:14:09,425
"Akiko Shiina, (30)" -She's living in an apartment around here.

259
00:14:09,425 --> 00:14:11,625
Her name is Akiko Shiina.

260
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,525
Shiina.

261
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:15,725
So you found her?

262
00:14:15,725 --> 00:14:17,925
The one on the right.

263
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:20,625
I think I've met her before.

264
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,225
Come and find me, mom!

265
00:14:23,225 --> 00:14:25,925
Hey, wait!

266
00:14:25,925 --> 00:14:27,925
Hey, Conan.

267
00:14:30,425 --> 00:14:33,225
I'm glad that Mrs. Shiina has got better.

268
00:14:33,225 --> 00:14:36,425
Yeah. I thought she would never get over the shock

269
00:14:36,425 --> 00:14:38,425
when her husband passed away.

270
00:14:38,425 --> 00:14:40,025
Excuse me, aunties.

271
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:42,525
Did Mrs. Shiina lose her husband?

272
00:14:42,525 --> 00:14:46,525
Yes. A month ago, Mr. Shiina was hit by a car.

273
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:50,025
The ambulance came and took him to the hospital right away.

274
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,825
Is that the motive?

275
00:14:53,825 --> 00:14:57,125
I heard it was already too late

276
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,525
when the ambulance came to the scene of the accident.

277
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:03,325
What? So, it's not the doctor's fault?

278
00:15:03,325 --> 00:15:07,025
What is she trying to do?

279
00:15:07,025 --> 00:15:10,725
She looks like a kind mother to me.

280
00:15:10,725 --> 00:15:12,025
Who is she?

281
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:13,525
Conan.

282
00:15:13,525 --> 00:15:15,125
What did you ask?

283
00:15:16,525 --> 00:15:17,725
Now I remember!

284
00:15:17,725 --> 00:15:20,725
I knew I saw her somewhere before.

285
00:15:20,725 --> 00:15:22,225
She was there.

286
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,525
Dr. Owada won the lottery ticket.

287
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:30,825
How can you laugh?

288
00:15:30,825 --> 00:15:32,825
As if nothing happened at all,

289
00:15:32,825 --> 00:15:35,225
without mourning the patient's death.

290
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,825
How could you act like that?

291
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:43,825
Now I see.

292
00:15:43,825 --> 00:15:47,125
Perhaps that was when she decided to make the plan.

293
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,325
Let's go home.

294
00:15:48,325 --> 00:15:49,325
-What? -What?

295
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:52,425
But you said something is going to happen soon.

296
00:15:52,425 --> 00:15:54,425
Nothing is going to happen, I think.

297
00:15:54,425 --> 00:15:56,825
I was just imagining things.

298
00:15:56,825 --> 00:15:58,425
Imagining things?

299
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:02,325
Then why was that woman making all those rumors?

300
00:16:02,325 --> 00:16:03,625
-That's right! -That's right!

301
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:07,025
The aunties told me that she is a habitual liar, believe it or not.

302
00:16:07,025 --> 00:16:08,425
A habitual liar?

303
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,525
What a troublemaker.

304
00:16:10,525 --> 00:16:13,225
Man, you're the troublemaker.

305
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:16,825
Even you make a mistake sometimes, Conan.

306
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:18,725
Yeah.

307
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:20,325
Now, let's go home!

308
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:32,625
I won't let anything happen.

309
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,025
I will not!

310
00:16:34,025 --> 00:16:37,325
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Where are you going, Conan?

311
00:16:37,325 --> 00:16:38,725
To Dr. Agasa's house!

312
00:16:38,725 --> 00:16:40,125
I left my stuff there.

313
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,425
-Be careful! -Okay!

314
00:17:14,025 --> 00:17:16,825
Does it make you feel better,

315
00:17:16,825 --> 00:17:19,325
if you kill Dr. Owada, Mrs. Shiina?

316
00:17:19,325 --> 00:17:22,525
I'm Mouri, a private detective.

317
00:17:23,725 --> 00:17:27,725
I heard some strange rumors about Dr. Owada,

318
00:17:27,725 --> 00:17:31,225
so I did some investigation and ended up with you.

319
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:33,125
Akiko Shiina.

320
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:37,625
I heard your husband was hit by a car a month ago.

321
00:17:42,325 --> 00:17:47,225
When the ambulance arrived at Beika Hospital,

322
00:17:47,225 --> 00:17:48,925
everybody knew that nothing could be done.

323
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:51,525
It was too late.

324
00:17:51,525 --> 00:17:53,725
But it was Dr. Owada who was on duty that night,

325
00:17:53,725 --> 00:17:55,825
he encourage your husband.

326
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,725
You're gonna be just fine! I'm gonna save you, so don't die!

327
00:17:58,725 --> 00:18:00,325
Come on!

328
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:04,225
He tried the best he could do to save your husband's life.

329
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,925
"In Operation"

330
00:18:30,725 --> 00:18:34,225
Of course it wasn't Dr. Owada's fault.

331
00:18:34,225 --> 00:18:36,125
And you knew it too.

332
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,825
You knew it, but...

333
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:41,225
How come you couldn't save him!

334
00:18:41,225 --> 00:18:43,325
Why? Why?

335
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:44,325
As a matter of fact,

336
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:47,225
the driver who hit your husband is the one to be hated,

337
00:18:47,225 --> 00:18:51,125
but he ran away, so there's no clue whatsoever about who he is.

338
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:57,825
Dr. Owada was the only one whom you could vent your anger out on.

339
00:18:57,825 --> 00:19:02,025
Then, your irrational anger against the doctor reaches its peak

340
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:05,425
after a half month passed.

341
00:19:07,225 --> 00:19:09,225
How can you laugh?

342
00:19:09,225 --> 00:19:11,325
As if nothing happened at all,

343
00:19:11,325 --> 00:19:13,625
without mourning the patient's death.

344
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,125
How could you act like that?

345
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:18,225
You felt it was unforgivable

346
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:21,425
and you even felt that you wanted to kill him.

347
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:24,825
However, you knew that

348
00:19:24,825 --> 00:19:29,325
nobody hates or holds a grudge against Dr. Owada.

349
00:19:29,325 --> 00:19:30,525
If you just murdered him,

350
00:19:30,525 --> 00:19:34,225
it was obvious that you were going to be the first suspect.

351
00:19:34,225 --> 00:19:42,025
Because people witnessed you having a fight with Dr. Owada.

352
00:19:42,025 --> 00:19:43,825
You wanted to kill Dr. Owada,

353
00:19:43,825 --> 00:19:46,925
but you cannot be arrested no matter what.

354
00:19:46,925 --> 00:19:48,925
If you get arrested,

355
00:19:48,925 --> 00:19:53,225
there will be no future for your little children.

356
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,325
So you came up with a plan.

357
00:19:56,325 --> 00:19:58,325
"Lottery ticket"

358
00:19:58,325 --> 00:20:01,025
The rumors about Dr. Owada as a man of good luck.

359
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:03,525
You made them up.

360
00:20:03,525 --> 00:20:05,925
Dr. Owada is so lucky, he's almost too lucky.

361
00:20:05,925 --> 00:20:08,525
So there are many people, envying him.

362
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:12,425
That's what you wanted to make people think.

363
00:20:12,425 --> 00:20:14,425
They weren't just simple rumors.

364
00:20:14,425 --> 00:20:18,225
You changed them to make them sound more realistic.

365
00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:22,425
This circumstance made it is safe for you to murder Dr. Owada,

366
00:20:22,425 --> 00:20:25,725
since the police would think that

367
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:29,025
one of the envious people murdered him.

368
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:32,325
Moreover, it would be impossible to find out who actually did it.

369
00:20:32,325 --> 00:20:33,625
Yes.

370
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:37,025
You created a fake situation,

371
00:20:37,025 --> 00:20:40,725
in which there were a lot of people with motive of killing the doctor.

372
00:20:40,725 --> 00:20:44,725
That way, you would just one of those people

373
00:20:44,725 --> 00:20:47,825
who might be envious enough to kill the doctor but didn't.

374
00:20:47,825 --> 00:20:50,125
It's like hiding a tree in a forest.

375
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,925
If there's no forest, then you can just make one.

376
00:20:51,925 --> 00:20:56,725
You made up all those rumors so they would disguise you.

377
00:20:56,725 --> 00:20:57,825
Am I right?

378
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,125
But Mrs. Shiina,

379
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,525
no matter how well you try,

380
00:21:04,525 --> 00:21:07,425
a criminal attempt can never be kept hidden.

381
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:13,225
But, it's not too late.

382
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:18,525
Because nothing happened yet.

383
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,325
Nothing happened yet.

384
00:21:22,325 --> 00:21:26,525
So, you can always still turn back.

385
00:21:26,525 --> 00:21:29,225
Now, please go home,

386
00:21:29,225 --> 00:21:32,125
before your beloved children wake up!

387
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,125
Mr. Mouri.

388
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,325
I will...

389
00:21:39,325 --> 00:21:42,325
I will never do this again.

390
00:21:42,325 --> 00:21:44,925
I know. It's gonna be all right.

391
00:21:44,925 --> 00:21:48,825
You will be able to get over it.

392
00:23:23,425 --> 00:23:24,725
Did you watch yesterday's Masked Yaiba?

393
00:23:24,725 --> 00:23:28,225
Yeah, the super Yaiba kick was incredible!

394
00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:29,325
Good morning, everyone!

395
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,925
-Good morning! -Good morning!

396
00:23:30,925 --> 00:23:33,825
Lord, please give them a peaceful day!

397
00:23:33,825 --> 00:23:35,225
-Yes! -Yes!

398
00:23:35,225 --> 00:23:37,225
Good morning...

399
00:23:37,225 --> 00:23:39,825
Nothing happened.

400
00:23:39,825 --> 00:23:41,025
Nothing.

401
00:23:48,525 --> 00:23:53,125
I guess I did something without realizing it, didn't I?

402
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,725
Well, it's all good!

403
00:23:56,325 --> 00:23:59,825
The luckiest guy in this world may be him.

404
00:24:31,652 --> 00:24:33,952
Next Conan's Hint:

405
00:24:33,952 --> 00:24:35,152
"Nameplate"

406
00:24:35,152 --> 00:24:36,852
The Youth Detective Squad take the center stage next time.

407
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:38,552
You must hurry up. It's gonna melt.

408
00:24:38,552 --> 00:24:40,752
It is not an ice-cream.
