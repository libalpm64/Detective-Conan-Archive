1
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,580
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,480
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,380
The potter's wheel turns at the pottery making class.

4
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,380
Everyone is curious about the words on the tea cup.

5
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,880
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,780
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,880
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:03,060
"Murder At The Pottery Making Class (Part 1)"

9
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,360
Hey Ran, look.

10
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,260
Ta-da!

11
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,160
Kyoku Shin?

12
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,960
Don't tell me you've started taking karate lessons?

13
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,460
Good grief, take a closer look!

14
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,360
Can't you read? It says Kyogoku Makoto.

15
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,460
I was just kidding.

16
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,260
Isn't this the tea cup you made

17
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,760
in the pottery class you've started going to?

18
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,060
For goodness sakes.

19
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,760
But Sonoko,

20
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,960
are you going to give this to him?

21
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,860
Isn't this a little small?

22
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,060
I know. That one's mine.

23
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,260
The one for Makoto...

24
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,660
Right here!

25
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,660
It's huge.

26
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,060
But why's your name on it?

27
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,960
The answer's so obvious.

28
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,060
The man I love is in a country far, far away...

29
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,060
The only way I can make him remember me

30
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,160
is through those far spaced telephone calls.

31
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,960
And that's where this tea cup handmade by Sonoko comes in!

32
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,860
He won't be able to forget me with this, now will he?

33
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,460
But Sonoko, didn't you send him a sweater before?

34
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,160
The one you bought at the store.

35
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,660
-Oh, that. I changed my mind. -Huh?

36
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,360
You were right, Ran. It's not fight to cheat.

37
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,860
And besides, no matter how hard I work on a sweater,

38
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,560
he can only use it in the winter.

39
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,660
But take a tea cup, he can use it every day, right?

40
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,260
Well, that's true.

41
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,560
Besides, I guess I'm worried.

42
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,060
Makoto's very kind.

43
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,460
I'm afraid some girl will come along

44
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,360
and take advantage of him.

45
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,060
For instance, there could be a lonely widow

46
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,660
who's just lost her beloved husband

47
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,060
and Makoto says something kind to comfort her

48
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,560
and she ends up stalking him...

49
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,460
What a cruel person.

50
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,460
To widow such a beautiful woman as yourself

51
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,260
in order to pay for his sins...

52
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,160
Young detective...

53
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,360
My lady.

54
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,960
If it pleases you, you may cry inside my arms.

55
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,160
No, you mustn't.

56
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,660
But young detective, I...

57
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,360
My lady.

58
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,560
Ran?

59
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,260
What's the matter, Ran?

60
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,460
Hey, Sonoko! Didn't you say

61
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,560
you were going to that pottery class every Sunday?

62
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
Yes, but why?

63
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,260
What is it? Are you interested in it?

64
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,260
Well, yes, a little.

65
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,860
"Three weeks later"

66
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,460
You're pretty good for a beginner.

67
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,360
Mr. Mino.

68
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,360
Too bad though, those letters spoiled that cup.

69
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,360
What does it mean anyway?

70
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,160
Well... it doesn't really mean anything.

71
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,060
I see. Well, keep up the good work!

72
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,860
Come on, what was it? What did you write?

73
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,860
It's a secret. Top secret!

74
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,560
You didn't, by chance, write "I love Shinichi", did you?

75
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,460
Of course I didn't!

76
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,160
-Then, let me see it! -No!

77
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,060
Little boy, what are you doing here?

78
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,660
I'm not doing anything.

79
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,460
Did you come with somebody?

80
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,560
Attention, everyone!

81
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,660
Does anyone know this child?

82
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,060
Conan?

83
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,560
Why did you come here?

84
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,760
Don't tell me you followed us here.

85
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,960
Uncle Kogoro asked me to come here and check on things.

86
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,260
That's strange.

87
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,160
Dad came here last week to look around.

88
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,960
I mean...

89
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,160
I get it! It was Shinichi.

90
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,960
I'll bet he's here

91
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,160
because Shinichi asked him to check up on us.

92
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,460
He wants to make sure you're not fooling around on him.

93
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,760
Fooling around?

94
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,260
No, you're wrong!

95
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,660
Shinichi wouldn't do anything that stupid.

96
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,160
That's the face of someone who's been paid off.

97
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,160
How much'd he pay you? 100 yen? 200 yen?

98
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,260
What a cheap skate.

99
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,360
It's no problem.

100
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,260
He's come all this way.

101
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,460
How about it, little boy? Do you want to making something?

102
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,060
Is that all right, sir?

103
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,260
Fine, I'll demonstrate how to do it.

104
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,360
Have you met the famous Kikuemon?

105
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,360
Yes. His students taught me

106
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,860
their techniques and about color and things.

107
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,360
Isn't that right, Ran?

108
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,460
Now I understand.

109
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,660
I knew you kids picked up too fast for beginners.

110
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,460
I really envy you.

111
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,560
You're friends with a living National Treasure.

112
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,060
Well, not exactly. He asked to see my father.

113
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,060
But they were there, a murder took place

114
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,460
and Ran's father did a brilliant job solving it, didn't he?

115
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,560
Huh? He solved it, you mean?

116
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,660
Oh, didn't my father tell you when he was here last week?

117
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,460
The truth is, my father's name is Kogoro Mouri.

118
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,460
He's a private detective.

119
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,060
Yes, I've heard of him.

120
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,960
Isn't he called "Sleeping Kogoro"?

121
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,660
How exciting! I'm a huge fan of his!

122
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,260
Boy, things are lively here today, huh?

123
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,860
Motoo, you're back.

124
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,760
I just got in.

125
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,660
I'll go change and help you, father.

126
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,960
Yes, sure. Thank you.

127
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,560
What? Life insurance?

128
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,660
He made you take one out?

129
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,160
Yeah. My father-in-law was pestering me to sign up,

130
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,460
he said just in case something happens.

131
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,660
Good grief.

132
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,860
I heard that at one time he was a talented potter

133
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,860
and everyone thought he'd be a new leader in the field,

134
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,460
but ever since his daughter died in that accident,

135
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,460
he's changed and now he's just an old drunk

136
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,960
that likes to play with mud.

137
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,360
Aren't you being terribly cold

138
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,160
to your late beloved wife and her father?

139
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,760
Beloved my foot!

140
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,160
I was going to divorce her

141
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,760
as soon as I got my hands on as much money

142
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,560
as I could from selling the things the old man made

143
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,660
but she went and died on me, just like that.

144
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,160
Don't let it bother you so much.

145
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,760
Mr. Mino's not young. He won't live much longer.

146
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,460
Yeah. When he dies, let's fold up this operation

147
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,660
and open our own place.

148
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,310
If we sell the pieces in the warehouse,

149
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:45,210
I'm sure they'll bring a good price.

150
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,410
By the way, who's the benefactor on that policy?

151
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,210
You, of course.

152
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:55,810
You've always been my woman. In the past and even now.

153
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,110
I'm so happy!

154
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:00,710
Then, you won't mind dying to repay my debts?

155
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,210
-Father! -Mr. Mino.

156
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,010
Kikuyo, here you are.

157
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,110
I'm going to go check the kiln,

158
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,110
take care of the students for me.

159
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,310
Yes, sir.

160
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,010
Isn't this a new necktie?

161
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,610
Yes. Kikuyo gave it to me last night for my birthday.

162
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,510
I told her I didn't look good in beige.

163
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,810
That's not true.

164
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:35,310
I think it looks very nice around your neck.

165
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,810
-Come on, Ran! Let me see it! -I said no!

166
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,710
Everybody's going to see it anyway when it gets fired up!

167
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,510
I am so sorry! Is it broken?

168
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,510
No, mine's okay.

169
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,110
Then, what was that sound just now?

170
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,310
Didnt' it come from the storage mom?

171
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,210
I'm going to go have a look.

172
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,410
Okay.

173
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:09,510
I just want you to know!

174
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,210
If you look at it, we're no longer friends!

175
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,710
All right.

176
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,560
Mr. Mino.

177
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,360
Oh, my hand slipped and I dropped a plate.

178
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,960
Thanks. Would you mind finishing up here?

179
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
Of course not.

180
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,760
Ouch!

181
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,760
Is something wrong?

182
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,460
It seems like something was mixed in with the soil.

183
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,360
I guess it was a piece of the plate I cracked,

184
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,860
it must've been on my clothes.

185
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,060
I'll go get the first aid kit.

186
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,860
Do you know where it is?

187
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,360
Yes, it's on the upper right shelf in the storage room.

188
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,660
Then bring it right away.

189
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,860
For goodness sakes.

190
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,760
Please be careful.

191
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,460
To a potter, hands are most important.

192
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,760
Is there something on my face?

193
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,860
No, it's nothing.

194
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,960
By the way, I haven't seen Motoo around.

195
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,060
Now that you mention it, neither have I.

196
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,060
Hey, Motoo!

197
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,460
Motoo?

198
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,360
He wasn't by the kilns either.

199
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,060
How strange.

200
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,660
This storage room's the only place we haven't looked.

201
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,460
He wouldn't be in here.

202
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,460
The only place you could hide in here is in that cabinet.

203
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,360
Besides, I opened it just a little while ago

204
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,660
to get the first aid kit and he wasn't inside.

205
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,560
The cabinet...

206
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,260
A piece of cloth...

207
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,660
is sticking out from under the cabinet door.

208
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,460
Isn't it one of the aprons you use in class?

209
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,860
You're right. It's the same pattern as the one we're wearing.

210
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,960
Good grief. This is like the ostrich hiding its head

211
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,660
but leaving its body in plain sight.

212
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,760
Come on out, the game's over.

213
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,260
-Motoo. -Wait! I'll open it.

214
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,220
Motoo! What's wrong, Motoo?

215
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,120
-Motoo... -Snap out of it!

216
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,720
Wake up, Motoo!

217
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,120
-Someone call an ambulance, quick! -All right!

218
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,920
I think it'd be better to call the police too.

219
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,020
-What? -Hurry!

220
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,020
Yes, sir!

221
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,920
Motoo...

222
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,320
The strangulation victim is Motoo Mino,

223
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,020
31 years old, a white collar worker.

224
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,420
Was he a student of this pottery making class too?

225
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,920
No, he lived here.

226
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,820
He was married to my daughter who died 2 years ago.

227
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,020
I see. My condolences.

228
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,720
My name is Muneyuki Mino. I run this pottery making class.

229
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,120
She's my assistant, Kikuyo Kasama.

230
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,420
Please tell me what the victim did after he got home.

231
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,120
He got home around 5 pm as usual,

232
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,120
then he said he was going to change into an apron

233
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,320
and help me in the class.

234
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
But some time passed and he still hadn't shown up

235
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,320
so we all went to look for him.

236
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,920
Isn't that right, Kikuyo?

237
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,120
Yes.

238
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,820
This storage room was the only place we hadn't looked

239
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,820
and then Mr. Mino opened the cabinet...

240
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:02,820
And his body... Motoo's body...

241
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,620
It's amazing that you found him there.

242
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,220
You weren't playing hide and seek,

243
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,520
who would've thought a person would be inside there?

244
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,620
It was so obvious. The apron was sticking out.

245
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,020
-Isn't that right, Ran? -Yes.

246
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,320
Apron?

247
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,020
It was sticking out.

248
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,820
Part of the apron he was wearing

249
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,020
was sticking out from under the door.

250
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,720
Do you know how long it was like that?

251
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,620
No, I don't.

252
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,020
I remember now. It wasn't sticking out

253
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,020
when we were cleaning up the broken plate.

254
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,120
What do you mean?

255
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,120
I accidentally dropped a plate in front of that cabinet.

256
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,420
The students heard the sound and came running,

257
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,620
I asked them to clean it up for me.

258
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,820
I guess I dropped it right after Motoo left the storage room

259
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,020
after changing into his apron.

260
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,320
Huh? You and the victim were in here together?

261
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,120
Yes, the aprons are kept in this cabinet.

262
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,820
That's why he always changed in here.

263
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,620
See. His jacket's hanging right over there.

264
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,020
There's several overalls hanging next to his jacket.

265
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,520
What are these?

266
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,020
Those are also for the students use.

267
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,020
When making large pots and such,

268
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,220
an apron isn't big enough to protect their clothing.

269
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,520
I see. But I wonder what the victim was doing in here?

270
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,520
Actually, while I was looking for Kikuyo,

271
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,120
I happened to find her here with Motoo.

272
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,320
-Is that true? -Yes.

273
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,120
I was helping him change. Then Mr. Mino came in

274
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,220
and he asked me to look after the class

275
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,320
because he was going to the kiln.

276
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,020
And then what did you do?

277
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,220
I did as I was told. I went back to the classroom.

278
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:49,220
So Mr. Mino, you were here with the victim alone.

279
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,420
Is that correct?

280
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,620
Wait just a minute, officer!

281
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,620
You're not implying that I killed him, are you?

282
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,920
Like I already told you,

283
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,620
Motoo left the room before I broke the plate.

284
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,020
If I'd killed him and hid his body in the cabinet,

285
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,820
the students would have noticed the apron sticking out

286
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,420
from under the door when they were cleaning up.

287
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,520
Perhaps the apron got stuck when you came back

288
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:20,320
and checked the body after the students had finished cleaning up.

289
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,520
I don't think so.

290
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,420
While we were cleaning up, Mr. Mino went to the kiln,

291
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,720
and when we finished cleaning up

292
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,220
and went back to the classroom,

293
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,320
Mr. Mino was already there.

294
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,120
After that, he was always beside Conan working on something.

295
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,720
Isn't that right, Conan?

296
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,920
Conan?

297
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,320
Yes.

298
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,420
Mr. Mino was with us the whole time

299
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,620
until we found Motoo's body,

300
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,320
he couldn't possibly have put the body in the cabinet.

301
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,120
I see. So it must have gone like this,

302
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,420
after you all had cleaned up the broken plate,

303
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,020
the killer called the victim to this storage room and killed him.

304
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,320
Or the murder could have taken place somewhere else

305
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,820
and the body brought back here when no one was looking.

306
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,420
I just remembered! Maybe Kikuyo saw the killer's face.

307
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,420
What?

308
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,520
I cut my finger while I was working

309
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,720
and Kikuyo came to the storage room to get the first aid kit.

310
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,720
That was just before we began our search for Motoo

311
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,520
so I just thought that maybe...

312
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,420
Did you see anyone?

313
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,920
No, no one.

314
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,520
Where is the first aid kit kept?

315
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,620
On the upper right shelf of that cabinet.

316
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,820
What? So you're saying you opened the cabinet?

317
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,420
Yes, I did but there was nobody inside.

318
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,720
That's the truth!

319
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,720
Inspector! After examining the victim's neck,

320
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,920
I've determined the victim was strangled

321
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,720
with this necktie we found around his neck.

322
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,720
But that is strange.

323
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,520
Why did the killer tie the necktie around the neck?

324
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,320
How awful. Kikuyo gave that necktie to him for his birthday.

325
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,920
I... I didn't give that to him!

326
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,320
You didn't? He told me you did though.

327
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,320
What is the meaning of this?

328
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,120
Well... He said he didn't know where it came from,

329
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,020
he found it in his bag along with a birthday card.

330
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,620
He really believed it was from me,

331
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,720
he thought I was just too shy to admit it.

332
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,320
Now that you mention it, he was mumbling something

333
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,320
when he walked out of the storage room.

334
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,220
Something about money turning people into monsters

335
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,820
and that his birthday had just come

336
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,220
but he would be eaten by a monster.

337
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,920
Eaten by a monster?

338
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,320
The truth is, officer, I want to tell you about that...

339
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,120
All right, Takagi. Check up on that right away.

340
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,320
Yes, sir!

341
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,920
Excuse me. Do you have a pen or something?

342
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,820
Mine's run out of ink.

343
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,020
Of course.

344
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,720
I'll go get one.

345
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,720
I'm sure there's some in the classroom.

346
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,520
Aren't those scissors?

347
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,420
Didn't the man from the crime lab ask for a pen?

348
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,620
Yes, you're so right.

349
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,220
And will you take a look at that? That's my cup.

350
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,820
It's almost finished.

351
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,120
See?

352
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,620
You really like pottery making, don't you?

353
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,020
Yes, I love it!

354
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,820
Besides, I want to finish this up

355
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,720
because I don't want to be like that man who died

356
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,020
and leave things half done.

357
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,620
Half done?

358
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,520
You mean you didn't notice?

359
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
His shirt sleeves were rolled up

360
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,820
but the length was different.

361
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,820
Huh?

362
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,320
You know what it looks like?

363
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,170
It looks like he was attacked

364
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,970
while he was changing into his apron and helping in class.

365
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:13,570
But sonny, maybe one sleeve got pulled down

366
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,670
while he struggled with the killer.

367
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,570
That's right!

368
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:21,170
Then the killer must've pulled his necktie too.

369
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,370
His necktie?

370
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:26,870
Yes, his necktie pin was really low.

371
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,970
And the button hole was stretched out too.

372
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,670
But maybe the necktie pin was a little too low.

373
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:38,870
Maybe he likes putting it there.

374
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,770
And maybe it's his style

375
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,170
to wear shirts with different length sleeves.

376
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:46,870
But sir, you like both the left and right evenly, don't you?

377
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,770
I mean when Mr. Motoo fell out, you were standing on the left

378
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,570
but you deliberately went around to the right side and yelled.

379
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,070
You actually wanted to fix the length of his sleeve, didn't you?

380
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:06,170
Also, his apron was sticking out from the right side of the door

381
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:11,070
and it would've been natural to open just the right side

382
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:15,070
but you opened both sides at the same time.

383
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,470
Yes, I guess you're right.

384
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:23,070
I like things even.

385
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,770
I'm finished!

386
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:28,770
It's my tea cup! Pretty good, huh?

387
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:32,470
Yes, that's really quite good.

388
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,870
But you know, sonny,

389
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,470
it appears as if you're worried about something.

390
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,170
You're either hiding some deep, dark secret

391
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:42,870
or debating about something important.

392
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,470
I'm right, aren't I?

393
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,370
The soul never lies.

394
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,670
You're very good, sir.

395
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,770
I think you should take care of your own affairs

396
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:58,870
before meddling in other people's.

397
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:03,270
But this is the cup you made, sir.

398
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,270
What?

399
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:08,170
While you were busy looking through the desk,

400
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,770
I put yours over here.

401
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,970
I thought for sure you'd catch on.

402
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:17,270
And if this is your tea cup,

403
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:21,270
then you must be hiding something.

404
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:26,970
Mr. Mino, what are you hiding?

405
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,170
Tell me.

406
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,440
Next Conan's Hint:

407
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,420
"Necktie pin"

408
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,320
In the next episode, the tea cup is fired up!

409
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,240
Pottery and crime are alike, once broken, it's the end.

410
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:41,890
Hey, that was pretty good!
