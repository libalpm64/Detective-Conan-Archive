1
00:00:02,644 --> 00:00:06,144
We the members of the Youth Detective Squad used our holidays

2
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,744
and first of all came to Kyoto.

3
00:00:08,744 --> 00:00:10,644
We're finally in Kyoto!

4
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:13,044
-How exciting! -Yes!

5
00:00:13,044 --> 00:00:16,044
But we're boarding the ship tomorrow,

6
00:00:16,044 --> 00:00:17,644
and yet why are we here the day before?

7
00:00:17,644 --> 00:00:21,244
Well, that's because while we're here in Kyoto,

8
00:00:21,244 --> 00:00:23,544
we may as well enjoy delicious food too, right?

9
00:00:23,544 --> 00:00:25,244
Especially sweets of Kyoto!

10
00:00:25,244 --> 00:00:26,344
That's right!

11
00:00:26,344 --> 00:00:28,244
Besides, I can drink local sake

12
00:00:28,244 --> 00:00:29,644
while watching the cherry blossoms at night!

13
00:00:29,644 --> 00:00:31,944
Wait a minute!

14
00:00:31,944 --> 00:00:33,044
Listen.

15
00:00:33,044 --> 00:00:34,844
We came all the way to Kyoto

16
00:00:34,844 --> 00:00:39,044
not to drink liquor or to eat sweets!

17
00:00:39,044 --> 00:00:43,044
We came to go onboard and experience a cruise on the Aegis Hotaka!

18
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:47,044
You came as our chaperones!

19
00:00:47,044 --> 00:00:48,944
But...

20
00:00:48,944 --> 00:00:51,344
While we're at it, we may as well...

21
00:00:51,344 --> 00:00:52,444
-Right? -Right?

22
00:00:52,444 --> 00:00:53,744
Right!

23
00:00:55,244 --> 00:00:57,244
Talk about off the point...

24
00:00:58,644 --> 00:01:00,544
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

25
00:01:00,544 --> 00:01:02,544
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

26
00:01:02,544 --> 00:01:04,744
A day before the cruise on the Aegis ship experience.

27
00:01:04,744 --> 00:01:06,844
A surprising incident occurs in Kyoto.

28
00:01:06,844 --> 00:01:08,344
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:08,344 --> 00:01:10,344
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:10,344 --> 00:01:12,844
His name is Detective Conan!

31
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,770
"Famed Shop's Sweets Disappears".

32
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:05,170
Rice oil is brushed onto the mold of the Bird of Kyoto to prevent sticking,

33
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,870
which after the exclusive batter is poured in.

34
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,270
It looks really good, doesn't it?

35
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,870
They don't just look tasty, they are tasty!

36
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,770
Even Ran got hooked on it after eating it at my house,

37
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,170
and came all the way here to buy it!

38
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,270
So, this is what you really came for after all.

39
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,170
What? No way!

40
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,870
What's the matter, Ran?

41
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,570
Listen to this, Sonoko!

42
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,270
All the chocolate flavors are sold out!

43
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,970
Don't scare me like that.

44
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,770
You scared me out of my wits.

45
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,870
But, we stopped over in Kyoto just for that, you know!

46
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,970
But, this isn't the only place

47
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,070
that carries the chocolate flavor, is it?

48
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,270
Yes, other us,

49
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,570
you can find them at the shops in Arashiyama, Shiokouji Street,

50
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,770
Shinkyougoku and Shirakawa.

51
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,870
Hey, is it true

52
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,470
that all the chocolate flavors disappeared?

53
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,270
The chocolate flavors disappeared?

54
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,170
What does disappeared mean?

55
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,470
"Kozo Umehara (63)" -Right, right.

56
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,370
"President of Umehara" -How did such a thing happen?

57
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,770
The thing is, we don't really know.

58
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,070
You don't know?

59
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,570
This morning,

60
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,770
the craftsmen of Umehara

61
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,170
definitely delivered the items.

62
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,970
40 boxes of Ogura flavor,

63
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,470
40 boxes of Maccha flavor

64
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,570
and 40 boxes of chocolate flavor are here.

65
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,370
Okay, thank you.

66
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,970
Shall we line them up then?

67
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,770
Huh? You're not finished lining up the items, are you?

68
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,670
Huh? Why?

69
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,970
Strange,

70
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,470
we certainly lined them up a while ago, didn't we?

71
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,270
Yeah. That's strange.

72
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,770
At any rate, you've got to line them out right away,

73
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,070
or the customers will come.

74
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,270
Huh? They're gone. The chocolate flavors are gone.

75
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,570
-What? -What?

76
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,470
Who did it? Where are they?

77
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,870
How come?

78
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,270
And now,

79
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,270
in order to have the items shared from other shops,

80
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,670
the craftsmen...

81
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,570
Hey, we've got trouble.

82
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,870
The chocolate flavors have disappeared

83
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,670
from the shops in Shirakawa and Shinkyougoku too!

84
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,770
No good!

85
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,670
Even at the shop in Uzumasa, the chocolate flavors are gone!

86
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,970
There are none at Shiokouji Street either.

87
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,470
What?

88
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,770
Which means, the chocolate flavors have disappeared from all five shops?

89
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,670
I... I guess so.

90
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,170
Is such a thing possible?

91
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,170
What's this?

92
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,370
What's all the fuss about?

93
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,870
Pops!

94
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,370
This is no time to be looking for souvenirs!

95
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,870
We've got a case, a case!

96
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,770
They say that the sweets that were here disappeared!

97
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,770
You know, I'm a great detective.

98
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,370
It's duck soup for me.

99
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,770
A great detective?

100
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,670
Right! Pops is the famed Kogoro Mouri!

101
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,870
Alias...

102
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,970
That Sleeping Kogoro?

103
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,270
Indeed! I am the great Detective Kogoro Mouri!

104
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,770
Please! Please lend us a hand!

105
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,170
Well...

106
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,170
I was going to go drinking under the cherry blossoms of Kyoto from now.

107
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,270
Oh, come on, please.

108
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,570
That's right, Dad! It's a grave case!

109
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,370
Grave case?

110
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,570
Hey, hey!

111
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:34,070
Isn't that thing on the ceiling a surveillance camera?

112
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:40,970
The image that is shown is only from 10:00 when the shop was opened.

113
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,370
What?

114
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,570
The shelf with the missing sweets is not shown.

115
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,670
The Bird of Kyoto is displayed right under the camera.

116
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,970
It's the time that we're realized that the chocolate flavors disappeared.

117
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,670
After this, we all looked everywhere in the shop.

118
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,870
Can you stop it right there?

119
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,370
What's the matter, Conan?

120
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,970
The person wearing the pink shirt on the upper left side of the screen...

121
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,370
Isn't she a bit strange?

122
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,070
Because she went near the shelf of the Bird of Kyoto?

123
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,070
No matter how you do it,

124
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,470
it's impossible to steal in such a short time.

125
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,770
Besides, she came after the chocolate flavor disappeared.

126
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,570
No, that's not it.

127
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,870
It's pretty cold today, isn't it?

128
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,970
Despite that, she's dressed quite lightly, isn't she?

129
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,170
Come to think of it, yes.

130
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,770
What's the big deal?

131
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,170
Oh, my.

132
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,570
This is a surprise.

133
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:41,070
Who do I find here but Mr. Mouri?

134
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,270
Who are you?

135
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,970
Inspector Ayanokoji from the Kyoto Prefectural Police Department, right?

136
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,870
What brings you to a place like this, Inspector?

137
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,870
"Fumimaro Ayanokoji" -Well, it's my day off today, you see,

138
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,070
"Inspector of Kyoto Prefectural" -so I was taking him for a stroll.

139
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,070
I see.

140
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,970
Do chipmunks need to take walks?

141
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,170
I wonder.

142
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,470
I mean, I don't think he's walking.

143
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,570
But, what good timing to drop by.

144
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,070
It's a burglary case.

145
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,470
It's showtime for the police!

146
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,070
I'll leave the rest to you!

147
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,470
Huh?

148
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,970
I'm so sorry.

149
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,570
We'll have some in by tomorrow.

150
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,570
It's still before noon and you're already sold out.

151
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,170
Isn't it a bit too early?

152
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,470
We were looking forward to it,

153
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,770
the chocolate-flavored Bird of Kyoto.

154
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:34,170
Can't you make the chocolate flavor from now?

155
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:38,370
We used up all the chocolate for today.

156
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,370
The chocolate that is used for the chocolate flavor

157
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,370
is not something we make here,

158
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,870
but we purchase choice selected chocolates from abroad.

159
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,870
Tomorrow's one won't come in till tomorrow.

160
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,170
Then, we can't taste the chocolate flavor until tomorrow.

161
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,470
No. It's got to be today.

162
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,170
It's got to be today? Why?

163
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,270
Today is the memorial day of the previous president.

164
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:09,570
That's why I wanted to start selling the new item today.

165
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,770
I'm sorry. It's all sold out.

166
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,370
Sold out?

167
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,070
What? Already?

168
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,670
I feel really bad for the customers who have been looking forward to it.

169
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,570
"Ogura"

170
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,970
Is this true?

171
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,270
I see, I understand.

172
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,070
I asked one of my colleagues

173
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,970
to interrogate at the shop in Uzumasa.

174
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,070
A shop that carried the Bird of Kyoto?

175
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,670
Yes, then they were told that the chocolate flavors disappeared

176
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:46,970
and someone saw a suspicious car parked in front of the shop.

177
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,870
A suspicious car?

178
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,270
What about the model and license plate number?

179
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,070
It was a pink compact car

180
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,070
and the model nor license plate number are unknown.

181
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,470
A pink colored compact car is not sufficient info.

182
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,370
Actually...

183
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,770
I saw a pink compact car too.

184
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,270
You saw it? When?

185
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,470
Let's see. It was when...

186
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,770
When we were looking for the chocolate flavors that disappeared.

187
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,270
You saw it too?

188
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:19,270
Yes, it was parked in front of the shop.

189
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,070
But...

190
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,270
If we could only find out what the license plate number is...

191
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,970
If so, why not ask the other shops too?

192
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,170
Huh?

193
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,370
Because if the driver of the car is the culprit,

194
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,270
she could've been witnessed at the other shops too, right?

195
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:37,170
Okay, then send officers out to ask around!

196
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,470
Hey, wait a minute.

197
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,170
If that many men are needed,

198
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,770
please ask the burglary division with jurisdiction over this area for help.

199
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,270
After all, I'm off-duty today.

200
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,470
Talk about being petty.

201
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,970
I'll go over to the shop on Shiokouji Street.

202
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,370
We can't be taking our time, or the culprit will get away!

203
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,870
-Okay, I'll go over to Shinkyougoku then! -Yep!

204
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,370
You go to the remaining shop in Shirakawa, okay, Dad?

205
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,670
What?

206
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,070
Mr. Ayanokoji,

207
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,270
can you wait here for contact from everyone?

208
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,170
Huh? Me too?

209
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,670
Listen,

210
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,870
Ayumi go with Ran,

211
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,770
Genta go with Sonoko

212
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,570
and Mitsuhiko go with Pops.

213
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,370
Get the license plate number of the car,

214
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,870
be it in fragments and contact me on it.

215
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,470
-Okay! -Understood!

216
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,970
I'll connect everything together!

217
00:11:30,562 --> 00:11:32,962
It's a pink compact car.

218
00:11:34,362 --> 00:11:37,462
Come to think of it, it was parked in front of the shop.

219
00:11:37,462 --> 00:11:39,662
Really? What was the license plate number?

220
00:11:39,662 --> 00:11:42,362
Huh? I didn't look...

221
00:11:42,362 --> 00:11:43,562
Just a little will do.

222
00:11:43,562 --> 00:11:46,062
If you remember any number, let me know.

223
00:11:46,062 --> 00:11:48,062
But...

224
00:11:48,062 --> 00:11:51,662
I think it was a Shiromi number.

225
00:11:51,662 --> 00:11:53,062
Thank you very much!

226
00:11:54,362 --> 00:11:55,562
I saw it, I did.

227
00:11:55,562 --> 00:11:57,862
I think it was a Shiromi number

228
00:11:57,862 --> 00:12:01,562
and the top was "one, one". That's all I remember.

229
00:12:01,562 --> 00:12:03,762
The top was "one, one", right?

230
00:12:03,762 --> 00:12:07,762
But to think that it disappeared from all the shops...

231
00:12:07,762 --> 00:12:10,162
Does anything ring a bell?

232
00:12:11,362 --> 00:12:15,262
It could be the curse of the previous president who passed away.

233
00:12:17,262 --> 00:12:20,962
"Shirakawa" -Conan, Mitsuhiko here.

234
00:12:20,962 --> 00:12:26,962
The only info I got was that the number 8 was towards the end.

235
00:12:26,962 --> 00:12:28,962
The number "8" towards the end, right?

236
00:12:28,962 --> 00:12:30,462
I got it!

237
00:12:30,462 --> 00:12:31,662
I see.

238
00:12:31,662 --> 00:12:33,662
A pink compact car,

239
00:12:33,662 --> 00:12:35,962
and if we know that much of the license number,

240
00:12:35,962 --> 00:12:38,962
maybe we can carry out a user inquiry.

241
00:12:46,362 --> 00:12:50,162
We found the user of the car that was witnessed.

242
00:12:50,162 --> 00:12:54,362
Her name is Mako Kawasumi, 22 years old, who lives in Shromi in Osaka.

243
00:12:54,362 --> 00:12:56,562
Have you ever heard of her?

244
00:12:56,562 --> 00:12:59,262
-No. -Not at all.

245
00:12:59,262 --> 00:13:01,462
It's a name I've heard for the first time.

246
00:13:01,462 --> 00:13:03,862
I see. At any rate,

247
00:13:03,862 --> 00:13:05,262
we're having that position of the car

248
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:07,862
tracked by the N system right now.

249
00:13:07,862 --> 00:13:08,862
Okay.

250
00:13:11,062 --> 00:13:12,862
You guys...

251
00:13:12,862 --> 00:13:14,262
Eat too, Conan.

252
00:13:14,262 --> 00:13:17,062
Sonoko bought it for us!

253
00:13:18,162 --> 00:13:20,262
The maccha is good!

254
00:13:20,262 --> 00:13:21,262
You think so too, don't you?

255
00:13:21,262 --> 00:13:24,862
I got hooked on the Bird of Kyoto after eating this flavor too.

256
00:13:24,862 --> 00:13:29,062
But it seems that the previous president didn't like it.

257
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:33,262
To begin with, the Bird of Kyoto

258
00:13:33,262 --> 00:13:34,862
originally started with only the ogura flavor,

259
00:13:34,862 --> 00:13:38,862
but the current president started selling the maccha flavor.

260
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:41,962
So, maybe they started the chocolate favor

261
00:13:41,962 --> 00:13:45,562
because the maccha flavor had a good reputation?

262
00:13:45,562 --> 00:13:48,662
That's why the craftsmen at Shinkyougoku...

263
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,162
If the previous president hears of the chocolate flavor,

264
00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:52,862
he'll probably die of shock.

265
00:13:52,862 --> 00:13:54,662
That's what he said.

266
00:13:54,662 --> 00:13:58,962
So, maybe this is...

267
00:13:58,962 --> 00:14:00,962
a curse!

268
00:14:02,162 --> 00:14:03,962
Cut it out, Sonoko!

269
00:14:07,862 --> 00:14:09,362
Ouch.

270
00:14:09,362 --> 00:14:12,062
I forgot how much Ran hated ghosts.

271
00:14:12,062 --> 00:14:13,162
Sorry.

272
00:14:19,562 --> 00:14:22,062
Inspector Ayanokoji!

273
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:23,462
Detective Kurumazaki.

274
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:24,962
Good work.

275
00:14:24,962 --> 00:14:27,062
"Detective Kurumazaki of Kyoto Prefectural" -10 minutes ago, the car

276
00:14:27,062 --> 00:14:31,862
is shown on the N system camera on Marutacho Street.

277
00:14:31,862 --> 00:14:34,362
It's near the shop in Shirakawa.

278
00:14:34,362 --> 00:14:35,562
Yes.

279
00:14:35,562 --> 00:14:37,762
And, this is the picture.

280
00:14:41,262 --> 00:14:42,462
This is...

281
00:14:44,962 --> 00:14:47,862
The woman in the pink shirt.

282
00:14:47,862 --> 00:14:51,062
Mitsuhiko, are you still at the shop in Shirakawa?

283
00:14:51,062 --> 00:14:52,362
Yes, I am.

284
00:14:52,362 --> 00:14:57,262
Because Mr. Mouri has started drinking and won't move.

285
00:15:02,762 --> 00:15:04,362
So, I'm told...

286
00:15:06,862 --> 00:15:10,162
That drunkard!

287
00:15:10,162 --> 00:15:12,162
Where are you going, Ran?

288
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,762
I'm going to grab him by the neck and bring him back!

289
00:15:14,762 --> 00:15:17,462
Oh, no. We be seeing bloody rain.

290
00:15:17,462 --> 00:15:18,862
We sure will.

291
00:15:18,862 --> 00:15:20,262
Miss.

292
00:15:20,262 --> 00:15:22,562
What're you going to do with that?

293
00:15:22,562 --> 00:15:23,762
This?

294
00:15:23,762 --> 00:15:25,162
I'm going to change it

295
00:15:25,162 --> 00:15:27,762
because this part is a bit soggy.

296
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:28,962
The box back then...

297
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:33,762
I feel really bad for the customers who have been looking forward to it.

298
00:15:33,762 --> 00:15:35,662
"Ogura"

299
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:38,662
Hey! Will you show me that?

300
00:15:41,162 --> 00:15:43,962
So, this is the Bird of Kyoto that you took out from below

301
00:15:43,962 --> 00:15:46,062
to replenish the stock.

302
00:15:46,062 --> 00:15:47,462
On this side is the Bird of Kyoto that you're going to change

303
00:15:47,462 --> 00:15:50,162
because it got soggy with tears.

304
00:15:50,162 --> 00:15:54,462
And this is the Bird of Kyoto ogura flavor that was lined out in front.

305
00:15:54,462 --> 00:15:56,662
Isn't it a little smeared?

306
00:15:57,862 --> 00:16:01,162
I wonder if it got that way when the seal was pasted on.

307
00:16:01,162 --> 00:16:02,562
But, look,

308
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:05,162
the seal of the one that you took out to replenish,

309
00:16:05,162 --> 00:16:07,362
isn't smeared.

310
00:16:07,362 --> 00:16:10,262
Conan, what's bothering you?

311
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:15,462
Maybe I was grossly mistaken.

312
00:16:16,762 --> 00:16:19,062
Uncle Kogoro!

313
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:22,562
Let's go back to where Conan and the others are, already.

314
00:16:24,362 --> 00:16:26,362
I keep telling you,

315
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:28,962
what's the rush?

316
00:16:28,962 --> 00:16:33,162
It's no big deal of a case anyway, so...

317
00:16:33,162 --> 00:16:35,362
It's no big deal?

318
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,162
Yes, that's right.

319
00:16:38,162 --> 00:16:40,862
It's no big deal of a case!

320
00:16:41,762 --> 00:16:44,362
You've got a lot of nerve drinking

321
00:16:44,362 --> 00:16:47,062
in the midst of a case, don't you?

322
00:16:47,062 --> 00:16:48,862
No, wait...

323
00:16:48,862 --> 00:16:50,262
Ran, it's not what you think!

324
00:16:50,262 --> 00:16:51,762
I...

325
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:53,262
The cherry blossoms are...

326
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,062
The cherry blossoms are pretty! -Uncle Kogoro...

327
00:16:57,262 --> 00:16:58,362
That person...

328
00:16:59,362 --> 00:17:01,262
Excuse me.

329
00:17:01,262 --> 00:17:03,662
You've gone to all the shops, haven't you?

330
00:17:03,662 --> 00:17:06,462
To all the shops that carry the Bird of Kyoto.

331
00:17:07,462 --> 00:17:10,762
Why? Why?

332
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:12,162
And in all the shops,

333
00:17:12,162 --> 00:17:15,362
the Bird of Kyoto chocolate flavor is gone.

334
00:17:18,562 --> 00:17:21,362
Mr. Mouri, Mr. Mouri.

335
00:17:21,362 --> 00:17:23,262
Mr. Mouri...

336
00:17:23,262 --> 00:17:26,662
Huh? Mr. Mouri's not here yet?

337
00:17:26,662 --> 00:17:29,562
Pops says he'll be back soon.

338
00:17:29,562 --> 00:17:31,462
And, how was it?

339
00:17:32,962 --> 00:17:35,562
Just as Mr. Mouri had said on the phone,

340
00:17:35,562 --> 00:17:38,562
something strange was detected here.

341
00:17:38,562 --> 00:17:40,362
Could that by chance be...

342
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:44,462
What? Yes, that's right!

343
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:46,962
How'd you know?

344
00:17:46,962 --> 00:17:49,562
Well, Pops Mouri told me that maybe.

345
00:17:49,562 --> 00:17:51,262
Well, well,

346
00:17:51,262 --> 00:17:53,162
a great detective he is indeed.

347
00:17:55,062 --> 00:17:56,162
Mr. Mouri.

348
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:08,862
What happened, Mr. Mouri?

349
00:18:08,862 --> 00:18:11,162
I happened to punish the drunkard a bit,

350
00:18:11,162 --> 00:18:12,762
and this is the outcome.

351
00:18:12,762 --> 00:18:14,662
Don't worry about it at all.

352
00:18:14,662 --> 00:18:16,362
A bit, huh?

353
00:18:17,562 --> 00:18:19,262
Well, I guess it serves him right.

354
00:18:19,262 --> 00:18:23,062
Oh, by the way, where's Kurumazaki?

355
00:18:23,062 --> 00:18:27,062
He was being asked to do something by Pops Kogoro a while ago.

356
00:18:28,662 --> 00:18:33,162
Mr. Mouri, what did you ask Kurumazaki to do?

357
00:18:33,162 --> 00:18:35,462
More than that, Inspector Ayanokoji,

358
00:18:35,462 --> 00:18:37,262
did you check on it?

359
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:39,262
The packages of Ogura flavored boxes

360
00:18:39,262 --> 00:18:40,862
that were line out in the shop.

361
00:18:40,862 --> 00:18:41,962
Yes.

362
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:46,462
Rice oil was found around the ogura flavor seals.

363
00:18:46,462 --> 00:18:47,762
Rice oil?

364
00:18:47,762 --> 00:18:52,162
We use rice oil as a parting agent at our shop.

365
00:18:54,162 --> 00:18:57,462
Hey, what's a parting agent?

366
00:18:57,462 --> 00:18:58,862
It's oil that is brushed onto the mold

367
00:18:58,862 --> 00:19:01,262
before that batter is poured into the mold

368
00:19:01,262 --> 00:19:03,262
so that it comes off easily after it's cooked.

369
00:19:03,262 --> 00:19:08,162
But why would that be on the ogura seals?

370
00:19:08,162 --> 00:19:10,362
It wasn't on the seals.

371
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:12,662
It was put on, deliberately.

372
00:19:12,662 --> 00:19:15,362
Before the ogura seals were pasted on.

373
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,162
40 boxes of Ogura flavor,

374
00:19:17,162 --> 00:19:18,662
40 boxes of Maccha flavor

375
00:19:18,662 --> 00:19:20,762
and 40 boxes of chocolate flavor are here.

376
00:19:20,762 --> 00:19:22,562
Okay, thank you.

377
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:25,162
Shall we line them up then?

378
00:19:27,162 --> 00:19:31,362
First, 10 boxes of each flavor are lined out.

379
00:19:31,362 --> 00:19:32,362
Which means

380
00:19:32,362 --> 00:19:35,562
all the needs to be rigged are the 10 chocolate flavor boxes.

381
00:19:35,562 --> 00:19:38,362
Holding cotton with rice oil soaked on it in the palm of the hand,

382
00:19:38,362 --> 00:19:42,062
the chocolate seal is traced and peeled off.

383
00:19:42,062 --> 00:19:45,062
Then, a new ogura seal is pasted on.

384
00:19:45,062 --> 00:19:46,962
Two people work on the 10 boxes.

385
00:19:46,962 --> 00:19:49,562
The first boxes of ogura that are lined out

386
00:19:49,562 --> 00:19:51,462
are put in the drawer for replenishment

387
00:19:51,462 --> 00:19:54,862
and the ogura boxes that have been re-sealed are moved over.

388
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:56,762
In other words, in this shop...

389
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,362
Rather,

390
00:19:58,362 --> 00:20:00,162
in all the 5 shops,

391
00:20:00,162 --> 00:20:02,462
there were no chocolate flavors to begin with.

392
00:20:05,362 --> 00:20:07,162
Detective Mouri!

393
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:08,862
Officer Kurumazaki!

394
00:20:08,862 --> 00:20:11,462
Just as Detective Mouri had said,

395
00:20:11,462 --> 00:20:13,662
in the workshop refrigerator of Umehara,

396
00:20:13,662 --> 00:20:16,162
the chocolates that were scheduled to be used today

397
00:20:16,162 --> 00:20:18,162
were left as is!

398
00:20:19,562 --> 00:20:20,562
In other words,

399
00:20:20,562 --> 00:20:23,962
no chocolate-flavored ones were made to begin with today.

400
00:20:23,962 --> 00:20:26,962
The only ones who can do something like this...

401
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:29,562
are the sweets craftsmen!

402
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:35,162
Why did you do something like this?

403
00:20:37,162 --> 00:20:42,162
The previous president really hated the maccha flavor.

404
00:20:42,162 --> 00:20:45,062
The more so with chocolate flavor.

405
00:20:45,062 --> 00:20:46,562
You do something like this just for that reason?

406
00:20:46,562 --> 00:20:49,062
It's not just for a reason like that!

407
00:20:49,062 --> 00:20:51,562
It's nothing like that.

408
00:20:51,562 --> 00:20:54,462
That's the very reason why we didn't want to sell

409
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,862
the chocolate flavor on the former president's memorial day.

410
00:20:57,862 --> 00:20:59,162
But...

411
00:20:59,162 --> 00:21:01,762
we had no idea that it would turn out to be something so serious.

412
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:04,462
We're very sorry.

413
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:36,462
Are you sure it's okay?

414
00:22:36,462 --> 00:22:38,262
You don't want to file charges.

415
00:22:38,262 --> 00:22:40,362
The former president left behind

416
00:22:40,362 --> 00:22:42,862
the skills of those craftsmen to me.

417
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,062
I see.

418
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:47,462
So, what's going to happen to the chocolate flavor?

419
00:22:47,462 --> 00:22:49,062
I won't be selling maccha and chocolate

420
00:22:49,062 --> 00:22:51,462
on the memorial day of the former president.

421
00:22:51,462 --> 00:22:54,462
Until the craftsmen come out from their side and allow it.

422
00:22:55,862 --> 00:23:00,662
But I got to like the Bird of Kyoto from the maccha flavor.

423
00:23:00,662 --> 00:23:02,262
Thank you.

424
00:23:04,162 --> 00:23:07,062
Huh? By the way, where's Mitsuhiko?

425
00:23:07,062 --> 00:23:09,262
Hey, everybody!

426
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,562
Mitsuhiko!

427
00:23:10,562 --> 00:23:12,862
What're you doing?

428
00:23:12,862 --> 00:23:14,462
I'm sorry.

429
00:23:14,462 --> 00:23:16,162
Well, you see...

430
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:20,362
Why? Why?

431
00:23:20,362 --> 00:23:22,362
And in all the shops,

432
00:23:22,362 --> 00:23:26,362
the Bird of Kyoto chocolate flavor is gone.

433
00:23:27,462 --> 00:23:29,162
Right!

434
00:23:29,162 --> 00:23:31,462
There are no chocolate flavors anywhere!

435
00:23:31,462 --> 00:23:32,862
Huh?

436
00:23:32,862 --> 00:23:35,062
This is the third shop.

437
00:23:35,062 --> 00:23:37,062
I've searched so hard and yet...

438
00:23:37,062 --> 00:23:39,262
Why aren't there any anywhere?

439
00:23:40,562 --> 00:23:43,362
She's just like Ran, no?

440
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,720
Next Conan's Hint:

441
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,080
"Type of grape".
