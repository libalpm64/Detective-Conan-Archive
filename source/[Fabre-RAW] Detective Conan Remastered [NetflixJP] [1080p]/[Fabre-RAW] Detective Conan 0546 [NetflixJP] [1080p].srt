1
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:03,228
Four years ago,

2
00:00:03,228 --> 00:00:05,328
there is a legendary woman driver, Silver-white Witch,

3
00:00:05,328 --> 00:00:08,528
who drives a white FD that is said to have street raced

4
00:00:08,528 --> 00:00:10,928
all over Mt. Fuyuna.

5
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:12,828
Accident after accident have been occurring to the street racers

6
00:00:12,828 --> 00:00:15,128
because recently the legendary driver has appeared again,

7
00:00:15,128 --> 00:00:18,328
challenging the street racers to have a match with her.

8
00:00:18,328 --> 00:00:21,128
According to Inspector Yamamura's grandmother

9
00:00:21,128 --> 00:00:24,028
that happened to encounter Silver-white Witch,

10
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:28,007
the witch'car sped through on the fog where there is no road.

11
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:29,328
And when she got out of the car,

12
00:00:29,328 --> 00:00:32,028
she stands on the fog and waves her hand.

13
00:00:33,028 --> 00:00:36,015
Pops who heard about this

14
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:38,028
head off early in the morning to Mt. Fuyuna

15
00:00:38,028 --> 00:00:41,228
saying that he was going to catch the witch.

16
00:00:41,228 --> 00:00:43,228
The witch's white FD appears

17
00:00:43,228 --> 00:00:45,628
on the mountain road enveloped by a thick fog.

18
00:00:54,328 --> 00:00:59,028
We pursue the witch as Pops goes after her with all his might,

19
00:00:59,028 --> 00:01:03,028
but the white FD leaves behind a woman's scream like skidding sound

20
00:01:03,028 --> 00:01:06,045
and disappears into the fog.

21
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:07,728
It can't be!

22
00:01:07,728 --> 00:01:10,328
This had got to be a trick of some kind!

23
00:01:10,328 --> 00:01:12,051
"Checkpoint" -In order to confirm this,

24
00:01:12,228 --> 00:01:15,528
we contacted Inspector Yamamura who was doing a checkpoint search,

25
00:01:15,528 --> 00:01:18,628
and asked him to stop all the white FDs.

26
00:01:18,628 --> 00:01:23,828
As a result, three FDs and three pairs of drivers were stopped.

27
00:01:23,828 --> 00:01:26,065
Is the witch among them?

28
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:31,028
And how did the witch's FD speed along on the fog?

29
00:01:33,028 --> 00:01:35,228
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

30
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,828
Saturday nights are for mystery.

31
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:39,828
Sounds of cars speeding within the fog.

32
00:01:39,828 --> 00:01:41,828
Disclose the true identity of the witch!

33
00:01:41,828 --> 00:01:43,428
He sees through the one and only truth.

34
00:01:43,428 --> 00:01:45,328
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

35
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:47,328
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

36
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,908
"Witch Enshrouded by Fog (Part 2)".

37
00:03:34,508 --> 00:03:36,195
"Raito Egashira (25)" -How rude!

38
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:38,197
We're telling you we're not warlocks!

39
00:03:39,108 --> 00:03:42,207
"Akira Mafune (26)" -Well, it's true that we're riding a white FD

40
00:03:42,207 --> 00:03:43,608
thanks to her, though.

41
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:46,808
Were you guys going fishing?

42
00:03:46,808 --> 00:03:50,508
See! The things in the backseat, aren't they fishing equipment?

43
00:03:50,508 --> 00:03:54,707
Yeah, because we get to fish for black bass in Lake Fuyuna.

44
00:03:54,707 --> 00:03:56,808
And? Is it really true

45
00:03:56,808 --> 00:04:00,219
that you didn't overtake anyone until you came here?

46
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:03,908
Yeah, because he was at the wheels today.

47
00:04:03,908 --> 00:04:07,908
He may not look it, but he's a safe driver.

48
00:04:07,908 --> 00:04:09,207
Shut up.

49
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,808
Hey.

50
00:04:10,808 --> 00:04:13,707
You're sure wearing some ring.

51
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:17,808
Yeah. Thanks to it, when I tried to fasten my seatbelt, it got stuck

52
00:04:17,808 --> 00:04:20,239
and I'm still bleeding.

53
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,808
The reason I'm riding a white FD?

54
00:04:22,808 --> 00:04:26,245
"Rumi Hando (23)" -Why else? Because I adore the witch!

55
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:28,508
"Haruka Kawai (24)" -She's charismatic, that's why!

56
00:04:28,508 --> 00:04:32,808
And? It seems that somebody overtook you on your way here?

57
00:04:32,808 --> 00:04:36,708
Yeah, I got a call while I was driving,

58
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:40,259
so I pulled over to the side. And that's when two to three cars overtook me.

59
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,708
Was that call by any chance from one of your golfing friends?

60
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,265
Because there are three golf bags inside.

61
00:04:46,265 --> 00:04:48,008
That's why I thought so.

62
00:04:48,008 --> 00:04:50,008
I'm asking you, who's he?

63
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:51,907
Well, this boy is...

64
00:04:51,907 --> 00:04:55,708
Huh, what happened to your fake nail?

65
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,277
Your middle fingernail is gone.

66
00:04:59,308 --> 00:05:00,808
When I shifted gears a while ago,

67
00:05:00,808 --> 00:05:03,608
it got stuck and disappeared.

68
00:05:03,608 --> 00:05:05,708
"Jinya Enda (31)" -You mean the witch that frequently appears here

69
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:08,287
is riding a white FD?

70
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:09,907
"Yasue Taira (28)" -I didn't know.

71
00:05:09,907 --> 00:05:13,708
Were you overtaken by another white FD?

72
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:19,190
Yes, I was buying canned coffee along the way, when I was overtaken,

73
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,708
but I don't remember what model car it was.

74
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,808
While drinking coffee in the car,

75
00:05:22,808 --> 00:05:27,008
we were all talking excitedly about Lakeside Park where we were headed.

76
00:05:27,008 --> 00:05:30,608
That's why you brought along floats and rubber boats?

77
00:05:30,608 --> 00:05:34,907
Well, we'd like to check your rubber boat and float for now then.

78
00:05:34,907 --> 00:05:37,907
Hey, Misao.

79
00:05:37,907 --> 00:05:39,208
Granny!

80
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:42,321
I told you to stay in the car!

81
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,607
Back then, the one who got off the car on top of the fog

82
00:05:45,607 --> 00:05:48,907
and waved back at me

83
00:05:48,907 --> 00:05:51,308
had a halo around her.

84
00:05:51,308 --> 00:05:55,907
She looked more like a goddess than a witch to me.

85
00:05:58,607 --> 00:06:01,808
So, the six of them went home.

86
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:04,708
The witch could've been among them and yet...

87
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:08,008
But the arms of the three

88
00:06:08,008 --> 00:06:09,808
that were sitting in the passenger's seat of each car

89
00:06:09,808 --> 00:06:13,907
were not anything like the witch's arm that we saw.

90
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:17,808
Dad also said that she could've really been a witch.

91
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:20,359
I see.

92
00:06:20,608 --> 00:06:22,008
Oh, right.

93
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:24,363
I just called because I was a bit concerned.

94
00:06:24,608 --> 00:06:26,365
Bye, then, Ran!

95
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,808
The Silver-white Witch of Fuyuna ridge...

96
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:32,108
Come to think of it,

97
00:06:32,108 --> 00:06:34,008
there was a time when you used to get up early in the morning

98
00:06:34,008 --> 00:06:36,375
to go there, wasn't there, Miwako?

99
00:06:36,607 --> 00:06:37,907
Yes.

100
00:06:37,907 --> 00:06:40,407
Because the hospital that the girl who lost both her parents,

101
00:06:40,407 --> 00:06:44,008
and lost her ability to speak because of the incident

102
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:46,107
was located at the top of the mountain.

103
00:06:46,107 --> 00:06:48,907
But after I went to see her several times,

104
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:51,308
she began to smile.

105
00:06:51,308 --> 00:06:52,907
By the time she was discharged from the hospital,

106
00:06:52,907 --> 00:06:57,107
she said, "I'm going to be a police detective like you".

107
00:06:57,107 --> 00:06:58,407
Fantastic, don't you think?

108
00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:02,401
And, didn't you see the witch back then?

109
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:05,708
Beats me, because wanted to see the girl as soon as possible

110
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,008
that I wasn't concerned about anything else.

111
00:07:09,008 --> 00:07:12,108
Somebody! Please stop him!

112
00:07:12,108 --> 00:07:13,708
A convenience store robbery?

113
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:14,808
Sorry, Yumi.

114
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:16,208
Let's go sing karaoke some other time!

115
00:07:24,808 --> 00:07:26,425
That car is fast!

116
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:32,708
Yumi, I'm sorry, but I'm doing "that" in a long time!

117
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:33,907
Huh? Are you serious?

118
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,808
What's going on?

119
00:07:42,808 --> 00:07:45,607
Are they having a car race or something?

120
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:47,808
Talk about taking it easy

121
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:49,607
when here we are looking for

122
00:07:49,607 --> 00:07:53,008
and troubled over an unidentifiable sonic witch.

123
00:07:53,008 --> 00:07:56,455
Well, I've more or less an idea on who the witch is.

124
00:07:56,455 --> 00:08:00,008
It's probably the FD of that person that made a weird remark

125
00:08:00,008 --> 00:08:02,208
but I still can't figure out at all, how the car sped on the fog

126
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:05,108
and the trick of standing outside and waving hands.

127
00:08:05,108 --> 00:08:06,465
Oh, no!

128
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,907
It's 8:50 pm!

129
00:08:08,907 --> 00:08:11,008
Yomiuri TV! Yomiuri TV!

130
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,473
The TV won't switch on!

131
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:17,308
I pulled the plug out when I used the vacuum cleaner a while ago.

132
00:08:17,308 --> 00:08:19,008
What?

133
00:08:19,008 --> 00:08:20,108
You idiot!

134
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:22,008
The ending song for today's drama

135
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:26,485
is "Midnight Mirage" by Yoko Okino!

136
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:27,808
Mirage?

137
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:31,608
How can you be vacuuming at an important time like this?

138
00:08:31,608 --> 00:08:34,493
It's because you knocked over the ashtray, Dad!

139
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:36,495
A phenomenon where the light warps

140
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,107
because of difference in density in the atmosphere,

141
00:08:38,107 --> 00:08:39,808
causing the creation of a landscape

142
00:08:39,808 --> 00:08:43,107
that is not there to look as if it really exists.

143
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:46,308
The person who waved back at me

144
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:48,507
had a halo around her.

145
00:08:49,408 --> 00:08:50,508
Halo?

146
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,908
This program was brought to you by the following sponsors.

147
00:08:54,908 --> 00:08:57,908
It finished because you were taking your good old time!

148
00:08:57,908 --> 00:09:00,308
It's because you dozed off.

149
00:09:00,308 --> 00:09:01,608
Okay, then!

150
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:06,108
I think we should go back to sleep again just in case.

151
00:09:06,108 --> 00:09:09,308
Because I think we're going to have to get up early tomorrow

152
00:09:09,308 --> 00:09:12,308
to go witch hunting!

153
00:09:12,308 --> 00:09:13,808
Witch hunting?

154
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:22,208
I hope you really know now

155
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,108
from the people that were stopped at the road check last week.

156
00:09:24,108 --> 00:09:28,308
Who of the three pairs of drivers is the witch?

157
00:09:28,308 --> 00:09:31,808
But the witch can drive the car on the fog

158
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:34,553
and even stand on the fog, you know?

159
00:09:34,553 --> 00:09:35,808
Maybe you're under the spell of the witch

160
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,708
and being made to think that way.

161
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,108
It's the arm!

162
00:09:39,108 --> 00:09:40,208
Arm?

163
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,108
Last week when we encountered the car of the witch,

164
00:09:43,108 --> 00:09:45,508
there was an arm sticking out of the passenger's seat, right?

165
00:09:45,508 --> 00:09:47,508
A witch's hand that looked as if

166
00:09:47,508 --> 00:09:49,508
it were wearing a bracelet of a ring.

167
00:09:49,508 --> 00:09:51,708
That's how I figured it out!

168
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,573
But arms of the two who were sitting in the passenger's seat of the car

169
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:56,208
with two men inside

170
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,577
were pretty hairy.

171
00:09:58,577 --> 00:09:59,808
The arm of the woman sitting in the passenger's seat

172
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,408
with the two women inside

173
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:03,708
was quite tanned.

174
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,585
The arm of the man in the passenger's seat of the car with the man

175
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:10,208
and woman couple inside was big and sturdy.

176
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,507
I think it was really different

177
00:10:11,507 --> 00:10:15,908
from the thin, white arm of the witch that we saw.

178
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:18,608
Of course! Because there's a person

179
00:10:18,608 --> 00:10:20,599
who's lying saying that he/she was in the passenger's seat,

180
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:22,408
when in fact that person was driving the car.

181
00:10:22,408 --> 00:10:23,708
Lying?

182
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,108
I see.

183
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:27,708
All the three pairs of people

184
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,608
that say they were driving have thin, white arms...

185
00:10:29,608 --> 00:10:35,108
They switched so that they wouldn't be suspected as being the witch.

186
00:10:35,108 --> 00:10:37,908
If so, the one that is suspicious is...

187
00:10:37,908 --> 00:10:39,608
that couple.

188
00:10:39,608 --> 00:10:41,708
The slightly plump man

189
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:45,908
who said that he was in the passenger's seat navigating the driver,

190
00:10:45,908 --> 00:10:49,908
when he was actually filling the rubber boat up with air.

191
00:10:49,908 --> 00:10:52,008
He couldn't have filled a rubber boat of that size up

192
00:10:52,008 --> 00:10:55,808
with air with his mouth, that was in the backseat,

193
00:10:55,808 --> 00:10:57,108
while sitting in the passenger's seat.

194
00:10:57,108 --> 00:10:59,008
Yes, he could've

195
00:10:59,008 --> 00:11:01,308
if he used a pump that is used to fill the tires of bicycles up

196
00:11:01,308 --> 00:11:03,308
or an electric air pump.

197
00:11:03,308 --> 00:11:06,108
That... that's true.

198
00:11:06,108 --> 00:11:09,908
Then, are you saying that it's the pair of two women?

199
00:11:09,908 --> 00:11:12,007
The fake nail of the middle finger of the person

200
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:14,408
who said she was driving was peeled off, right?

201
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:17,608
So, maybe she hurriedly switched her fake nails

202
00:11:17,608 --> 00:11:20,208
that were black to new ones.

203
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,108
That could be,

204
00:11:22,108 --> 00:11:25,007
but since she said that it came off when she shifted gears,

205
00:11:25,007 --> 00:11:28,007
so the fake nail on her left hand could've come off too.

206
00:11:28,007 --> 00:11:33,208
Then, don't tell me that the man with the hairy arm is lying.

207
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:36,108
Because he said that when he fastened his seatbelt,

208
00:11:36,108 --> 00:11:40,108
he scratched his right cheek with his ring by mistake, right?

209
00:11:40,108 --> 00:11:41,808
The witch's FD is a Japanese model,

210
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:43,208
so the steering wheel is on the right-hand side.

211
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,608
If he scratched his right cheek,

212
00:11:45,608 --> 00:11:47,908
it would be that he pulled the seatbelt from

213
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,689
on the right-hand side of the driver's seat and fastened it.

214
00:11:51,608 --> 00:11:55,008
Then, the arm of that witch...

215
00:11:55,008 --> 00:11:58,008
I guess you want to say that it was that of the man

216
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,208
who was riding with the hairy man.

217
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,007
The pale white and thin man who made his arm

218
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:05,608
look like that of the witch by using accessories and fake nails,

219
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:08,708
but how are you going to explain how they sped on top of the fog

220
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,808
and stood on top of it too?

221
00:12:11,808 --> 00:12:13,208
Oh, that's...

222
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,208
That's?

223
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,007
Have you figured it out?

224
00:12:16,007 --> 00:12:18,007
Of course not!

225
00:12:18,007 --> 00:12:19,908
It's really strange, isn't it?

226
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:21,308
Give me a break.

227
00:12:23,108 --> 00:12:25,608
I can't say any more than this.

228
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:27,007
But, then again,

229
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:32,108
I can't put Pops to sleep with the tranquilizer gun while he's driving.

230
00:12:32,108 --> 00:12:33,408
Oh, right!

231
00:12:33,408 --> 00:12:34,508
Come to think of it,

232
00:12:34,508 --> 00:12:38,208
the new song that Yoko is singing this time, "Midnight Mirage",

233
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,008
don't you think that it's a weird title?

234
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:41,508
What?

235
00:12:41,508 --> 00:12:45,308
Because you can't see mirages at night.

236
00:12:45,308 --> 00:12:48,508
A kid could never figure out what adults are trying to imply.

237
00:12:48,508 --> 00:12:51,008
A mirage is a kind of magic that makes visible

238
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:54,753
something that is actually not there looks like it's really there, right?

239
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:58,108
It's not magic but just natural phenomenon!

240
00:12:58,108 --> 00:13:00,759
Maybe the car that was in front of us

241
00:13:01,007 --> 00:13:03,507
that looked like it was speeding on the fog

242
00:13:03,507 --> 00:13:06,308
was actually not there too.

243
00:13:06,308 --> 00:13:07,507
You idiot.

244
00:13:07,507 --> 00:13:10,769
I saw with my very eyes

245
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:12,507
as the witch's car turned left

246
00:13:12,507 --> 00:13:14,773
where there was no road and sped on the fog.

247
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:16,408
But the only thing you could see

248
00:13:16,408 --> 00:13:18,308
was the red tail lights, right?

249
00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:22,308
The fog was thick like today back then too.

250
00:13:22,308 --> 00:13:23,908
It was just the lights,

251
00:13:23,908 --> 00:13:25,608
you heard the sound too, didn't you?

252
00:13:25,608 --> 00:13:28,208
The sound of tires skidding along the road.

253
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,789
That's why I steered the wheels to the left.

254
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,108
Huh? What's so funny?

255
00:13:35,108 --> 00:13:38,797
Because you were lured by the light right into the trap.

256
00:13:39,008 --> 00:13:42,308
Just like a fish that is lured over by the light of a football fish

257
00:13:42,308 --> 00:13:44,803
and eventually eaten.

258
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:46,508
Football...

259
00:13:46,508 --> 00:13:48,808
Football fish, you say?

260
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:52,108
Right! They had fishing rods with them!

261
00:13:52,108 --> 00:13:53,308
If they attached

262
00:13:53,308 --> 00:13:56,508
a red light like that of a football fish's on the tip of the rod,

263
00:13:56,508 --> 00:13:58,608
and stick the rod out of the window of the passenger's seat side

264
00:13:58,608 --> 00:14:00,208
just before turning the right curve,

265
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,308
at the same time swaying the rod to the left side,

266
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,823
it would probably look like a left turn was made!

267
00:14:05,007 --> 00:14:07,608
The sound of the tires

268
00:14:07,608 --> 00:14:10,829
could've been recorded on a car stereo or something beforehand too!

269
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:14,108
I thought of a simple trick like that too,

270
00:14:14,108 --> 00:14:16,835
but that doesn't explain what's going on!

271
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:19,808
Standing on top of the fog, that is!

272
00:14:19,808 --> 00:14:20,839
Right.

273
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:24,843
Speeding on the fog and standing on the fog

274
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:27,208
are the same tricks that were used by the witch.

275
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,507
Because we kept thinking on that line,

276
00:14:28,507 --> 00:14:31,507
we couldn't see through the simple trick.

277
00:14:31,507 --> 00:14:32,851
They couldn't have attached a puppet

278
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:36,855
or something to the tip of the rod and moved it either.

279
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:40,008
Then, why don't we ask the one who's doing it to solve the mystery?

280
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:42,861
The... the one? Don't tell me that you...

281
00:14:43,108 --> 00:14:45,408
There she is,

282
00:14:45,408 --> 00:14:48,867
the Silver-white Witch of Fuyuna ridge!

283
00:14:57,408 --> 00:14:59,508
It... it's the same as back then!

284
00:14:59,508 --> 00:15:00,908
Sign of a battle!

285
00:15:03,408 --> 00:15:05,908
Darn! You're not getting away from me today!

286
00:15:05,908 --> 00:15:08,108
Don't get lured over by the tail lights!

287
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,507
Okay!

288
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:12,507
We're not the only ones today!

289
00:15:26,346 --> 00:15:29,746
Darn, pretty good like always, huh?

290
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:32,911
But today, you're not getting your way!

291
00:15:38,446 --> 00:15:39,746
Talk about fast!

292
00:15:40,446 --> 00:15:42,246
It made a left.

293
00:15:42,246 --> 00:15:44,046
I'm not going to be deceived! Or so it seems...

294
00:15:44,046 --> 00:15:46,546
But it actually made a right!

295
00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:50,546
There! Just as I thought!

296
00:15:50,546 --> 00:15:53,746
It's speeding along on the road like it should be.

297
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:55,946
She's rushing to pull the rod inside.

298
00:15:55,946 --> 00:16:00,546
But, no lights were on before that car made the turn, though.

299
00:16:00,546 --> 00:16:02,446
Easy!

300
00:16:02,446 --> 00:16:04,943
As for the tail lights, if you turn off the light, it'll turn off.

301
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:08,046
If you use side brakes and drift when making the turn,

302
00:16:08,046 --> 00:16:10,546
even the brake lamps won't go on!

303
00:16:10,546 --> 00:16:11,546
Darn!

304
00:16:11,546 --> 00:16:13,746
Why aren't they falling for it?

305
00:16:13,746 --> 00:16:16,746
I'll brush them away at the next hairpin curve!

306
00:16:26,646 --> 00:16:29,346
Good! They can't keep up!

307
00:16:29,346 --> 00:16:31,546
I'm going to make them lose us!

308
00:16:36,346 --> 00:16:37,546
What the...

309
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:54,993
Too bad, super hairy witch!

310
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:58,046
Phooey, what a bummer.

311
00:16:58,046 --> 00:17:00,999
To think that there's a car that's spinning in a place like this.

312
00:17:01,246 --> 00:17:04,046
No, it's just as calculated.

313
00:17:04,046 --> 00:17:05,646
Right, Yamamura?

314
00:17:05,646 --> 00:17:07,005
Oh, yes.

315
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:08,546
I've been waiting all this time

316
00:17:08,546 --> 00:17:11,846
since I received contact from Mr. Mouri telling me to block the road.

317
00:17:11,846 --> 00:17:15,013
Well, since I was driving slowly

318
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:18,046
about 200 meters ahead of your car, Mr. Mouri,

319
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:20,646
I almost fell asleep part way.

320
00:17:23,046 --> 00:17:25,546
You framed us into this.

321
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:28,046
Okay, I'm all ears.

322
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:30,346
Tell me, why you did what you did?

323
00:17:31,346 --> 00:17:32,746
What?

324
00:17:32,746 --> 00:17:36,646
You wanted to clean this ridge of street racers?

325
00:17:36,646 --> 00:17:39,037
Aren't you guys street racers too?

326
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:42,046
Yeah, originally,

327
00:17:42,046 --> 00:17:45,946
but our friend died of an accident during a race battle.

328
00:17:45,946 --> 00:17:47,646
That's when we quit.

329
00:17:48,646 --> 00:17:51,446
We got annoyed at those guys who continued to race battle

330
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:54,446
as if nothing had happened at all.

331
00:17:55,846 --> 00:17:58,346
That's why we thought up this trick to scare them,

332
00:17:58,346 --> 00:18:01,046
hoping to get rid of them.

333
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,646
Taking advantage of the witch that outraced all the street racers

334
00:18:03,646 --> 00:18:06,146
that were here four years ago.

335
00:18:06,146 --> 00:18:09,846
Well, I guess you can call it bettering the world.

336
00:18:09,846 --> 00:18:11,646
In fact, thanks to us,

337
00:18:11,646 --> 00:18:14,446
the street racers coming to this ridge have decreased.

338
00:18:14,446 --> 00:18:17,075
Hey, do you understand or what?

339
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:20,646
That there are people who are critically wounded because of you?

340
00:18:20,646 --> 00:18:24,146
Yeah, we feel bad about it.

341
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:26,846
By the way, how did you manage to stand on the fog

342
00:18:26,846 --> 00:18:28,446
as well as wave back?

343
00:18:28,446 --> 00:18:32,446
Yeah, your grandmother said something like that,

344
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:34,246
but we have no recollection of it.

345
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:37,095
Maybe she was dreaming or seeing things?

346
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:39,097
Brocken spectre.

347
00:18:39,346 --> 00:18:41,946
The light of the sun seeping in from behind

348
00:18:41,946 --> 00:18:44,446
is dispersed by the cloud and fog.

349
00:18:44,446 --> 00:18:46,346
A circle of light that looks like a rainbow

350
00:18:46,346 --> 00:18:48,546
envelopes the silhouette of the person who is watching,

351
00:18:48,546 --> 00:18:50,546
that is, a halo is created.

352
00:18:51,546 --> 00:18:54,846
It's a phenomenon that is seen frequently at Mt. Brocken in Germany,

353
00:18:54,846 --> 00:18:56,846
and from this queer spectacle,

354
00:18:56,846 --> 00:19:00,646
it has also been called the fairy of Brocken.

355
00:19:00,646 --> 00:19:03,546
I... I saw a special program about it on TV.

356
00:19:03,546 --> 00:19:05,123
TV again...

357
00:19:05,346 --> 00:19:09,127
Which means the grandma waved to her own shadow

358
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:12,546
and mistook it as someone waving back at her.

359
00:19:12,546 --> 00:19:17,135
Well, at any rate, I'll have one of my men come get your car,

360
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:20,046
so will you two please get in my car and come with me to the station?

361
00:19:20,046 --> 00:19:23,446
Let me go get my wallet then.

362
00:19:26,446 --> 00:19:28,146
Yumi?

363
00:19:28,146 --> 00:19:31,149
No, as for the witch, we just caught her now!

364
00:19:31,346 --> 00:19:33,151
Huh? It's not here.

365
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:35,846
Hey, look over that side too.

366
00:19:42,246 --> 00:19:43,746
That bastard!

367
00:19:43,746 --> 00:19:45,446
No, you mean he fled?

368
00:19:45,446 --> 00:19:47,165
Hey! Did you write down the license plate number?

369
00:19:47,346 --> 00:19:48,746
Oh, no.

370
00:19:48,746 --> 00:19:52,046
I was going to do that after reaching the station.

371
00:19:52,046 --> 00:19:55,746
Darn! They know this ridge by heart.

372
00:19:55,746 --> 00:19:57,546
I wonder if we can catch up with them!

373
00:19:58,846 --> 00:20:00,546
Huh?

374
00:20:00,546 --> 00:20:04,146
That car...

375
00:20:04,146 --> 00:20:05,946
It can't be...

376
00:20:05,946 --> 00:20:08,846
Hey, are we going to be all right, fleeing like this?

377
00:20:08,846 --> 00:20:11,946
Yeah, I mean after all, that officer looked dense too.

378
00:20:11,946 --> 00:20:14,946
Besides, I'm on parole right now.

379
00:20:14,946 --> 00:20:17,946
If they find out that I'm involved in something like this...

380
00:20:19,546 --> 00:20:21,199
Woman's scream?

381
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:23,846
Idiot. It's the sound of tires skidding!

382
00:20:28,546 --> 00:20:30,246
Hey, speed up!

383
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:31,946
It's catching up with us!

384
00:20:31,946 --> 00:20:35,213
No, the speed of the car coming from behind is ridiculous!

385
00:20:35,446 --> 00:20:37,215
If I press on the gas more than I am now...

386
00:20:40,146 --> 00:20:42,046
Darn! They're right behind!

387
00:20:42,046 --> 00:20:45,746
Hold it! I know this sound!

388
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:48,646
I tried to copy it and listened to it repeatedly,

389
00:20:48,646 --> 00:20:50,346
which after I worked on the mufflers and tires,

390
00:20:50,346 --> 00:20:52,646
trying to come up with the same sound, but in vain.

391
00:20:57,846 --> 00:21:00,246
It... it's the witch's scream!

392
00:21:10,446 --> 00:21:12,646
Yes, this is the police station!

393
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,253
Pull over to the side and stop the car!

394
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:17,646
-Police? -Police?

395
00:21:22,646 --> 00:21:25,046
Officer Sato!

396
00:22:51,146 --> 00:22:52,446
What?

397
00:22:52,446 --> 00:22:55,846
The witch that appeared four years ago was officer Sato?

398
00:22:55,846 --> 00:22:57,355
Is that for real?

399
00:22:57,355 --> 00:23:01,346
Yes, she was not at all aware though.

400
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:04,746
She didn't even know that her car was a FD either.

401
00:23:04,746 --> 00:23:08,346
But Officer Sato's car's not white, is it?

402
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:10,046
She changed the color of her car

403
00:23:10,046 --> 00:23:15,046
because some time in the past, a car hassled her at that ridge and it spun.

404
00:23:15,046 --> 00:23:18,246
She thought that white is a difficult color to see in the fog.

405
00:23:18,246 --> 00:23:22,246
But, did Officer Sato's car sound like that?

406
00:23:22,246 --> 00:23:26,146
Yeah, it sounds like someone screaming.

407
00:23:26,146 --> 00:23:28,146
That's Miwako's habit.

408
00:23:39,397 --> 00:23:42,346
When I want to drift and make a curve without pulling the side brakes lever,

409
00:23:42,346 --> 00:23:46,146
it seems to go well when I scream as I do so!

410
00:23:46,146 --> 00:23:48,346
It's a bit embarrassing, though.

411
00:23:49,407 --> 00:23:51,946
That's what she told me!

412
00:23:51,946 --> 00:23:54,046
She really screamed.

413
00:23:54,046 --> 00:23:58,046
No wonder it sounds like a scream.

414
00:23:58,046 --> 00:23:59,417
No doubt.

415
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,680
Next Conan's Hint:

416
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,423
"Gun".

417
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,888
What's our next episode?

418
00:24:07,888 --> 00:24:09,758
Conan is going to hang out with the culprit for two days!

419
00:24:09,758 --> 00:24:10,760
What does that mean?
