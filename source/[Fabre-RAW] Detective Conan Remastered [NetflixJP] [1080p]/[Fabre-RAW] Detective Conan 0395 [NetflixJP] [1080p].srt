1
00:00:05,351 --> 00:00:06,951
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:06,951 --> 00:00:08,351
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:08,351 --> 00:00:09,951
Great adventure at the mansion of tricks.

4
00:00:09,951 --> 00:00:11,651
Surprising tricks that are dangerous enough to take lives.

5
00:00:11,651 --> 00:00:13,751
Youth Detective Squad, outfox that snobbish guy!

6
00:00:13,751 --> 00:00:15,251
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:15,251 --> 00:00:16,851
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,151
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,522 --> 00:02:00,022
I figured out the mail address of the boss of the Black Organization

10
00:02:00,022 --> 00:02:03,422
from the melody of the "Seven Baby Crows".

11
00:02:03,422 --> 00:02:05,722
But I decided not to pursue any further

12
00:02:05,722 --> 00:02:08,122
after Haibara gives me a piece of her mind.

13
00:02:09,222 --> 00:02:10,222
In the meantime,

14
00:02:10,222 --> 00:02:13,822
Genta and the others found a strange stone box.

15
00:02:15,322 --> 00:02:18,822
And there, they find a code having to do with the Big Jewel,

16
00:02:18,822 --> 00:02:23,222
as well as a strangled corpse beside it.

17
00:02:24,822 --> 00:02:27,822
And in its hand brimming with stones.

18
00:02:30,122 --> 00:02:31,622
Hey, Conan.

19
00:02:31,622 --> 00:02:34,622
What is it? Tell us what follows.

20
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:39,422
Its hand brimming with...

21
00:02:39,422 --> 00:02:41,322
the Big Jewel!

22
00:02:45,122 --> 00:02:46,822
No doubt about it.

23
00:02:58,322 --> 00:03:04,222
"Adventure at an Eccentric Mansion - Tricks"

24
00:03:06,822 --> 00:03:08,722
I see.

25
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:13,922
I guess this is the start of diamond cut diamond.

26
00:03:15,522 --> 00:03:17,122
What's that?

27
00:03:17,122 --> 00:03:19,322
It's a proverb of Belgium.

28
00:03:19,322 --> 00:03:23,122
In order to cut hard diamond, another diamond has to be used, right?

29
00:03:23,122 --> 00:03:25,622
Therefore, it refers to the start of a composed yet vicious battle

30
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,822
between the sages and the strong men.

31
00:03:30,422 --> 00:03:33,222
But who's battling against who?

32
00:03:36,422 --> 00:03:38,022
Idiot.

33
00:03:38,022 --> 00:03:41,622
Neither he nor I is something as great as a diamond.

34
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:47,822
He's just a thief who hides the truth under a veil and enjoys it.

35
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:53,922
And I'm just a detective who's dying to tear off that veil.

36
00:03:57,422 --> 00:04:00,922
And? Just who is that thief?

37
00:04:00,922 --> 00:04:05,622
Are you talking about the partner of the man who was sunk into the swamp?

38
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:11,122
A snobby evil thief who only goes after large gems like Big Jewel,

39
00:04:11,122 --> 00:04:14,522
called Thief Kid.

40
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:17,422
Thief Kid...

41
00:04:18,622 --> 00:04:19,622
Yes.

42
00:04:20,622 --> 00:04:22,822
I know that name.

43
00:04:22,822 --> 00:04:25,322
Elusive and daring.

44
00:04:25,322 --> 00:04:26,922
Gentleman thief.

45
00:04:26,922 --> 00:04:29,122
Doc has told me

46
00:04:29,122 --> 00:04:31,322
about your battles.

47
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:33,922
Our battles?

48
00:04:33,922 --> 00:04:36,922
It seems that you've been outfoxed quite a few times?

49
00:04:36,922 --> 00:04:39,322
It's not that he outfoxed me or anything.

50
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:42,322
Because he's never stole any treasure from me yet.

51
00:04:42,322 --> 00:04:44,622
Is Thief Kid here?

52
00:04:46,122 --> 00:04:48,522
It's just my guess.

53
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:51,422
It was written in the man's notebook, right?

54
00:04:51,422 --> 00:04:55,022
"So now I can outfox that petty thief that puts on airs."

55
00:04:56,322 --> 00:04:59,822
That petty thief that he was referring to is probably Thief Kid.

56
00:04:59,822 --> 00:05:02,922
Then are you saying the one that killed that man...

57
00:05:02,922 --> 00:05:05,022
Was Thief Kid?

58
00:05:05,022 --> 00:05:06,322
Beats me.

59
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:10,622
Rumour has it that he never takes a person's life though.

60
00:05:10,622 --> 00:05:14,022
But it's for sure that Thief Kid as well as the one who killed that man

61
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,322
is still around here somewhere.

62
00:05:16,322 --> 00:05:17,822
Right,

63
00:05:17,822 --> 00:05:20,222
if the treasure hasn't been found yet.

64
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:26,022
It's most likely that it's inside this mansion.

65
00:05:30,822 --> 00:05:33,322
Well, it's started to rain.

66
00:05:33,322 --> 00:05:37,122
So let's take shelter from the rain and take a look inside.

67
00:05:37,122 --> 00:05:38,122
Then...

68
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:39,522
We're going to start...

69
00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:41,922
Treasure hunting, right?

70
00:05:41,922 --> 00:05:43,922
Don't get me wrong.

71
00:05:43,922 --> 00:05:47,322
It's only until Doc calls the police and they get here, understand?

72
00:05:47,322 --> 00:05:49,122
All right...

73
00:06:22,022 --> 00:06:26,922
But now that we're going inside, it sure is a creepy mansion.

74
00:06:26,922 --> 00:06:30,222
Are you sure there's treasure in here?

75
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:34,022
I'm sure it's hidden somewhere in here.

76
00:06:34,022 --> 00:06:36,422
It bothered me a while ago, but...

77
00:06:36,422 --> 00:06:39,522
The brand new traces of wet mud on the border of the wall

78
00:06:39,522 --> 00:06:42,222
and the floor of the mansion.

79
00:06:42,222 --> 00:06:45,122
Moreover, throughout the mansion there is...

80
00:06:45,122 --> 00:06:46,722
I wonder why?

81
00:06:46,722 --> 00:06:48,222
Hey, Conan!

82
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:52,122
Explain the meaning of the writing one more time!

83
00:06:52,122 --> 00:06:56,022
The meaning of the writing that was written inside the stone lantern.

84
00:06:56,022 --> 00:06:58,222
Oh, that...

85
00:06:58,222 --> 00:07:01,622
The God Nioh is not around, right?

86
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,022
Right.

87
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:06,222
The resting place of the God Nioh is near the sun,

88
00:07:06,222 --> 00:07:09,922
in an extremely busy location where the elders get together.

89
00:07:09,922 --> 00:07:12,222
That is where the God Nioh stone is.

90
00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:14,922
Those who do not fear the rage of the God Nioh,

91
00:07:14,922 --> 00:07:18,022
get a hold of the stones that are brimming out of its hand

92
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:20,922
and learn from the proverb of long ago.

93
00:07:20,922 --> 00:07:23,122
Kichiemon Samizu.

94
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:24,922
In other words,

95
00:07:24,922 --> 00:07:28,622
the God Nioh sleep in a place closest to the sun

96
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:32,122
and where the elders gather, in a very lively place.

97
00:07:32,122 --> 00:07:34,022
That's where the stone of the God Nioh is.

98
00:07:34,022 --> 00:07:37,922
In other words, the place where the diamond is hidden, right?

99
00:07:37,922 --> 00:07:41,322
But the point is the words that follows.

100
00:07:41,322 --> 00:07:43,022
Yes, that's right.

101
00:07:43,022 --> 00:07:45,322
Conan went on to explain it part way and became silent,

102
00:07:45,322 --> 00:07:47,022
so we still don't understand it.

103
00:07:47,022 --> 00:07:50,022
Those who do not fear the rage of the God Nioh,

104
00:07:50,022 --> 00:07:53,422
get a hold of the stones that are brimming out of its hand

105
00:07:53,422 --> 00:07:56,122
and learn from the proverb of long ago.

106
00:07:57,722 --> 00:07:59,822
What does that mean?

107
00:07:59,822 --> 00:08:01,922
The God Nioh is going to get angry after all.

108
00:08:01,922 --> 00:08:03,022
Right.

109
00:08:03,022 --> 00:08:06,322
And the comma-shaped bead made of stone with the word fire carved onto it

110
00:08:06,322 --> 00:08:09,522
that was hidden in the hem of the dead body that was found a while ago.

111
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:15,422
I have no idea what this has to do with the code.

112
00:08:15,422 --> 00:08:18,222
Hey, let's go inside already.

113
00:08:18,222 --> 00:08:20,122
Hold your horses.

114
00:08:20,122 --> 00:08:24,022
Isn't there anything else written in that man's notebook?

115
00:08:24,022 --> 00:08:26,122
There is,

116
00:08:26,122 --> 00:08:29,522
but since it's wet I think we should wait until it dries.

117
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:31,622
Otherwise it'll rip and become unreadable.

118
00:08:31,622 --> 00:08:33,922
We don't have all day, you know.

119
00:08:35,622 --> 00:08:36,722
Hey, Genta!

120
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:42,822
Genta!

121
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,822
Don't go inside carelessly.

122
00:08:44,822 --> 00:08:48,222
The puppet maker Kichiemon built this mansion, you know.

123
00:08:50,122 --> 00:08:53,522
The diamond is in a place nearest to the sun, right?

124
00:08:53,522 --> 00:08:55,622
-If so, then I'm sure it's hidden... -Hey, Genta!

125
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:57,422
at the top most part of the house!

126
00:09:04,222 --> 00:09:07,222
At any rate, let's go to the very top.

127
00:09:08,622 --> 00:09:10,922
Hold it, Genta!

128
00:09:10,922 --> 00:09:15,222
One step at a time. It's gonna be alright.

129
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,422
What?

130
00:09:22,022 --> 00:09:23,122
Genta!

131
00:09:30,222 --> 00:09:31,822
-Genta! -Genta!

132
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:38,222
Huh?

133
00:09:42,122 --> 00:09:46,122
What's with you kids?

134
00:09:46,122 --> 00:09:48,622
Genta, are you all right?

135
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:52,622
Are you guys looking for Kichiemon's treasure, too?

136
00:09:52,622 --> 00:09:54,122
No.

137
00:09:54,122 --> 00:09:55,422
Well, who cares?

138
00:09:55,422 --> 00:09:57,722
You'd better be really careful though.

139
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,522
This step is a trap!

140
00:10:04,622 --> 00:10:08,422
If you want to go up, you have to go on farther beyond.

141
00:10:08,422 --> 00:10:11,822
Puppet maker Kichiemon is quite a sourpuss, you know.

142
00:10:11,822 --> 00:10:16,822
If you move just according to what you see, you'll get hurt.

143
00:10:16,822 --> 00:10:20,322
By the way, didn't you guys found an odd looking stone?

144
00:10:20,322 --> 00:10:22,022
As to that...

145
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:25,322
We didn't found anything!

146
00:10:25,322 --> 00:10:27,122
Oh, really?

147
00:10:27,122 --> 00:10:29,822
Tell me if you found it then, okay?

148
00:10:29,822 --> 00:10:31,722
Okay, sure!

149
00:10:31,722 --> 00:10:33,822
Hey, Conan.

150
00:10:33,822 --> 00:10:36,222
Why are you lying?

151
00:10:36,222 --> 00:10:39,122
He's a good man who saved Genta, you know?

152
00:10:41,022 --> 00:10:43,122
You never know if he's a good man.

153
00:10:44,222 --> 00:10:48,222
He could acting friendly just so he can take away the stone.

154
00:10:48,222 --> 00:10:53,122
Yes. If that guy is Thief Kid the more so.

155
00:10:53,122 --> 00:10:56,422
He could even be the guy who killed the body that was found a while ago.

156
00:10:57,722 --> 00:11:01,722
But it seems that we'd be safer staying close to the guy

157
00:11:01,722 --> 00:11:04,522
because he seems to know a lot about the traps inside this mansion.

158
00:11:04,522 --> 00:11:08,022
Also so that he doesn't get away till the police get here.

159
00:11:08,022 --> 00:11:12,422
I wonder if Doc got hold of the police already?

160
00:11:14,422 --> 00:11:16,922
Is it still farther away?

161
00:11:16,922 --> 00:11:19,622
That dilapidated mansion?

162
00:11:19,622 --> 00:11:21,722
Well...

163
00:11:23,322 --> 00:11:25,722
It's hard to find it in the dark.

164
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,022
Now, which way was it?

165
00:11:31,022 --> 00:11:32,922
Come on.

166
00:11:36,422 --> 00:11:38,122
Oh, carps!

167
00:11:38,122 --> 00:11:39,522
There are a lot of them.

168
00:11:39,522 --> 00:11:42,122
This place is like a high class Japanese restaurant

169
00:11:42,122 --> 00:11:44,422
with the river flowing throughout the house.

170
00:11:44,422 --> 00:11:47,722
I wonder if it's connected to the swamp outside.

171
00:11:49,122 --> 00:11:50,222
Look.

172
00:11:50,222 --> 00:11:51,822
There's even a bridge.

173
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:56,222
All right.

174
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,622
A pitfall?

175
00:12:10,322 --> 00:12:13,222
I'm not going to fall for the same trick this time.

176
00:12:13,222 --> 00:12:15,522
No, it looks like a pitfall but it's actually...

177
00:12:40,822 --> 00:12:42,522
Amazing!

178
00:12:42,522 --> 00:12:44,522
It's just like an elevator.

179
00:12:46,222 --> 00:12:48,822
Conan.

180
00:12:48,822 --> 00:12:50,622
Get on quickly.

181
00:12:56,322 --> 00:12:59,422
In other words, if we try to go up, we end up going down.

182
00:12:59,422 --> 00:13:03,122
And if we try to go down, we go up, right?

183
00:13:03,122 --> 00:13:05,322
Once you get the hang of it, it's pretty simple.

184
00:13:05,322 --> 00:13:06,522
Yes!

185
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:11,622
Here we are.

186
00:13:13,422 --> 00:13:15,122
It was simple, wasn't it?

187
00:13:19,622 --> 00:13:20,922
How silly.

188
00:13:20,922 --> 00:13:22,122
If it were that easy,

189
00:13:22,122 --> 00:13:24,822
we wouldn't have to go through the trouble of looking for it.

190
00:13:24,822 --> 00:13:28,622
Isn't it right, treasure hunter with kids?

191
00:13:32,422 --> 00:13:34,922
These kids are not with me.

192
00:13:34,922 --> 00:13:38,622
And I don't think you should be using knives around kids.

193
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:41,322
Take a good look at the tip of the knife.

194
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,222
Poison spider?

195
00:13:44,222 --> 00:13:47,122
Kichiemon was not only a sourpuss

196
00:13:47,122 --> 00:13:49,022
but he seems to have been quite mean, too.

197
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:53,222
If you want to go to the very top, it's this way.

198
00:13:53,222 --> 00:13:56,922
Hey, could she be Thief Kid?

199
00:13:56,922 --> 00:13:59,022
I thought Thief Kid was a boy.

200
00:13:59,022 --> 00:14:02,222
I've heard that he disguises himself as a woman, too.

201
00:14:07,422 --> 00:14:10,322
Right, kids. Be careful now.

202
00:14:10,322 --> 00:14:12,422
The spider could still be around somewhere, you know.

203
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:17,622
Wait for me!

204
00:14:24,022 --> 00:14:26,022
Conan, hurry up and come.

205
00:14:26,022 --> 00:14:27,622
You're going to get bitten by the poison spider!

206
00:14:29,422 --> 00:14:31,222
I'm coming!

207
00:14:35,922 --> 00:14:37,022
Hey, look!

208
00:14:37,022 --> 00:14:39,522
It seems like we've reached the top.

209
00:14:39,522 --> 00:14:42,022
But there's nothing here.

210
00:14:42,022 --> 00:14:44,222
Does it mean it's on the roof?

211
00:14:44,222 --> 00:14:47,622
In order to climb up on the roof...

212
00:14:47,622 --> 00:14:48,922
Strange.

213
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:52,122
How come there are no thick pillars on this floor?

214
00:14:52,122 --> 00:14:54,022
Here it is. A ladder!

215
00:14:55,822 --> 00:14:59,622
There were thick pillars on the floors below.

216
00:14:59,622 --> 00:15:02,422
Okay! We're going to be the first ones to get there.

217
00:15:02,422 --> 00:15:04,122
Wait a second.

218
00:15:04,122 --> 00:15:06,322
If the big pillar were to be hollow...

219
00:15:07,522 --> 00:15:09,622
No! That's a trap!

220
00:15:16,222 --> 00:15:17,322
Hey!

221
00:15:17,322 --> 00:15:18,322
Shoots!

222
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,522
Genta! Ayumi!

223
00:15:24,522 --> 00:15:26,422
Mitsuhiko! Haibara!

224
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,240
Hey, are you all right?

225
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,840
I'll send a rope down right now!

226
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,540
Remember, we were saying,

227
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:16,040
if you try to go up, you'll fall down.

228
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,740
Not again.

229
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,740
Are you guys all right?

230
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,240
-Yes. -Yes.

231
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,240
Yes.

232
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,640
We somehow got down safely,

233
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,140
but we're down at the very bottom, aren't we?

234
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,340
We were supposed to go to the top.

235
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:46,240
I checked on top the roof, but there was nothing there.

236
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,440
Really?

237
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,740
You were probably right to come down here.

238
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,740
It hurts.

239
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,740
What?

240
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,340
Skulls!

241
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,840
Hey, Conan!

242
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,040
Hey, this place is full of skulls!

243
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,040
What?

244
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,140
From the looks of their outfits,

245
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,040
they look to be treasure hunters.

246
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,040
No.

247
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,240
Even this old man, too.

248
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,840
Not an old man, but an old woman.

249
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,340
I slept well.

250
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,040
She's alive!

251
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,340
Which means that you're our rival, too?

252
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,840
You're a treasure hunter, aren't you?

253
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,440
I'm not here on leisure.

254
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,440
I just came to pay homage to the grave.

255
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,840
Grave?

256
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,740
Yes. Kichiemon's grave.

257
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,140
Kichiemon Samizu's grave?

258
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,440
The grave of Kichiemon Samizu?

259
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,640
This time for sure, I'll be the first one!

260
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,840
At the rate you're going,

261
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,140
the kids will get to the treasure before you do.

262
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,140
"Lost ones, offer the sacred treasure to me.

263
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,040
Samizu Kichiemon."

264
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,940
Hey, grandma. Isn't this a code?

265
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,540
Oh, is it?

266
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,740
I just took it to be Kichiemon's gravestone.

267
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,340
But what does it mean?

268
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,440
Is it asking for some kind of offering?

269
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,940
But we have no flowers or food.

270
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,540
Come to think of it,

271
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:40,840
the man who was found in the swamp was also holding and hiding something.

272
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,040
The comma-shaped bead made of stone.

273
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,440
Sir.

274
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,940
You asked a while ago

275
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,940
if we found an odd looking stone, right?

276
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,940
Don't you have an odd stone on you, too?

277
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,440
What?

278
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,340
We found one, too.

279
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,540
One of the sacred treasures made of stone.

280
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,340
Hey, Conan.

281
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,540
Didn't you said to keep that a secret?

282
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,740
What was written on it?

283
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:15,240
Something was carved on the stone you found, right?

284
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,740
So you found one, too.

285
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,340
Well...

286
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,740
Oh, my.

287
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,840
Under these circumstances, I don't think that hogging information

288
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,340
would do anyone any good.

289
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,740
Right, right.

290
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,740
If you don't want to be excluded,

291
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,740
hurry up and show us what you have.

292
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,540
Okay.

293
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:49,740
The thing I found is this mirror made of stone.

294
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,540
The letter carved on it is forever from the word eternal.

295
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,840
Then, it does have something to do with the sun.

296
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,440
Because it keeps burning forever, too.

297
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,940
Which means that the one that you kids found

298
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,940
had something like flames carved on it?

299
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,840
Yes.

300
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,240
You hit the bull's eye.

301
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,140
But I can't make it out.

302
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,340
Forever and flames.

303
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,440
Maybe if we stick those stones somewhere inside the gravestone,

304
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,340
the God Nioh stone which is the diamond will come out?

305
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,140
What makes you think so?

306
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,740
Because it was carved inside the stone garden lantern

307
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:34,040
that the diamond would be in a busy place where elders get together, right?

308
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,940
Is this the busy place where elders get together?

309
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,440
Yes. What was it?

310
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,540
The resting place of the God Nioh?

311
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,940
The resting place of the God Nioh is nearest to the sun,

312
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:51,140
in an extremely busy location where the elders get together.

313
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,940
That is where the God Nioh stone is, right?

314
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,940
Yes!

315
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,040
I guess you want to interpret the part that goes,

316
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:04,740
"An extremely busy place where the elders get together"

317
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,440
to this shabby pile of dead bodies.

318
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,040
Yes.

319
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,540
But those here are the foolish ones

320
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,040
who have been blinded by greed and decayed,

321
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,040
not being able to find the way out of here.

322
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:22,540
When Kichiemon built this mansion, none of them were here.

323
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,140
I guess so.

324
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,040
Then you saw the lanterns, too?

325
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,940
They weren't sunk in the swamp though.

326
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,240
At any rate, I guess the treasure is not here.

327
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,340
Because this grave doesn't seem to have a place to insert the stone.

328
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,440
I guess we'll have to find the other sacred treasure

329
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,540
to solve the mystery.

330
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,240
The other?

331
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,740
They're called the three sacred treasures.

332
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,940
The mirror and the comma-shaped bead were found,

333
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,040
so there should be one more somewhere.

334
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,140
The three sacred treasures?

335
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,940
Yes. The mirror is the Mirror of Yata,

336
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,140
the comma-shaped bead is called the Magatama of Yasakani.

337
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,940
And the remaining one

338
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,940
is the sword of the God Nioh.

339
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:11,140
It got its name because it is said to have saved God Takeru Yamato,

340
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,040
who was in a pinch

341
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,240
by slashing down the grass when fire was set to the field.

342
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,040
The Sword of Kusanagi.

343
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,140
-The Sword of Kusanagi? -The Sword of Kusanagi?

344
00:24:31,867 --> 00:24:34,267
Next Conan's Hint:

345
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:36,367
"Kichiemon Samizu"

346
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:37,667
Is Kichiemon some kind of gate?

347
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:39,467
-No. -It's the name of a person!

348
00:24:39,467 --> 00:24:40,967
That's what it usually is.
