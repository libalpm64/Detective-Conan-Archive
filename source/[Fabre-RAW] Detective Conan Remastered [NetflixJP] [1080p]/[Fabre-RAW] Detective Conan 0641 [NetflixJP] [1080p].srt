1
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:05,125
We visited Okayama.

2
00:00:05,125 --> 00:00:07,325
We encounter a woman there who has amnesia

3
00:00:07,325 --> 00:00:09,525
and end up helping to find out her identity.

4
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:12,425
The clues that we have to go on,

5
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:14,425
are the 8 sketches that she drew.

6
00:00:17,325 --> 00:00:19,125
After we started investigating,

7
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,525
we ran into a friend of hers,

8
00:00:21,525 --> 00:00:24,125
Ms. Kanae Nonomiya, who had also been looking for her.

9
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,525
"Kanae Nonomiya (25)" -According to Kanae,

10
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,525
we find out that the woman's name is Mayuko Kichise.

11
00:00:28,525 --> 00:00:31,525
We also found that Mayuko was an eye-witness who could prove

12
00:00:31,525 --> 00:00:33,725
that Kanae's older brother who was arrested as a suspect

13
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:35,525
"Keigo Nonomiya (28)" -of a robbery case was innocent.

14
00:00:35,525 --> 00:00:37,625
Unless Mayuko regains her memory,

15
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,525
it's impossible to prove that he was just a scapegoat.

16
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:42,925
While investigating

17
00:00:42,925 --> 00:00:45,125
we find that Mayuko's room has been ransacked,

18
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:48,225
or that there's suspicious figure following us around.

19
00:00:48,225 --> 00:00:50,825
We couldn't help but smell smoke.

20
00:00:50,825 --> 00:00:53,925
Amidst all this, Mayuko's whereabouts become unknown.

21
00:00:53,925 --> 00:00:57,025
No good. Mayuko's life is in danger.

22
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,125
Like the fog clears.

23
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,625
Let's see through love and crime as well.

24
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,425
Lost memory returns.

25
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:07,625
At the end of the trip through Okayama and Kurashiki.

26
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,125
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,025
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:11,025 --> 00:01:13,325
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

29

"Memory Trip of the Eight Sketches (Kurashiki Part)"

30
00:03:07,183 --> 00:03:08,983
No!

31
00:03:10,383 --> 00:03:12,583
Help, somebody!

32
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,283
Go get him!

33
00:03:26,283 --> 00:03:28,483
Ms. Mayuko.

34
00:03:28,483 --> 00:03:30,683
Ms. Mayuko, are you all right?

35
00:03:30,683 --> 00:03:32,183
Ms. Mayuko.

36
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:37,183
It's dangerous, we should call the police

37
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:39,183
and have you taken into custody after all.

38
00:03:39,183 --> 00:03:42,183
But, I can't possibly trust the police

39
00:03:42,183 --> 00:03:43,683
who have the nerve to arrest

40
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:45,683
my older brother who is innocent.

41
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:49,883
Yes, so... please let us continue as is.

42
00:03:51,883 --> 00:03:53,783
Thank you, Mayuko.

43
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:55,183
I'm sure that brother would...

44
00:03:55,183 --> 00:03:57,583
I'm not doing this only for your older brother.

45
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:00,583
I feel so wretched.

46
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,583
While I was crying myself out,

47
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,983
not being able to remember the past, all the pain,

48
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:08,383
I felt so lost, then suddenly the past overwhelmed me.

49
00:04:08,383 --> 00:04:11,983
I felt sort of vexed.

50
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:15,983
I'm going to get my memory back no matter what it takes.

51
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:18,983
I understand.

52
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:21,183
I admire Mayuko.

53
00:04:21,183 --> 00:04:24,883
I'll bet she's actually a very strong person.

54
00:04:27,683 --> 00:04:29,983
You've come to visit a friend here?

55
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:31,783
Another coincidence.

56
00:04:31,783 --> 00:04:33,383
We really synch, don't we?

If there's anything I can do, please let me know anytime.

59
00:04:40,883 --> 00:04:42,583
Thank you very much.

60
00:04:45,383 --> 00:04:46,483
I'll be going then.

61
00:04:46,483 --> 00:04:47,583
See you.

62
00:04:50,183 --> 00:04:51,883
Is something the matter?

63
00:04:51,883 --> 00:04:55,483
That man looks familiar.

64
00:04:55,483 --> 00:04:56,483
Really?

65
00:04:56,483 --> 00:04:58,883
Of course.

66
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:00,483
To all local sweet fans here

67
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:02,683
he's considered their God.

68
00:05:02,683 --> 00:05:04,783
Our company did a special on him too.

69
00:05:06,983 --> 00:05:08,083
"Charisma Pastry Chef, Kenzo Taira" -See.

70
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,383
Is he Mr. Taira?

71
00:05:10,383 --> 00:05:13,183
"Teruyuki Nashita (35)" -Yes, he looked so different

72
00:05:13,183 --> 00:05:14,483
that I was surprised, though.

73
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,883
We only have 5 more sketches to go.

74
00:05:19,883 --> 00:05:22,983
I wonder what place this indicates?

75
00:05:25,183 --> 00:05:26,983
I have no idea...

76
00:05:28,683 --> 00:05:30,983
I just realized,

77
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:34,583
but could this be referring to the sounding boiling pot reading?

78
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,483
Sounding boiling pot?

79
00:05:37,683 --> 00:05:39,783
The sounding boiling pot reading

80
00:05:39,783 --> 00:05:41,383
is a ritual in this Kibitsu Shrine

81
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,683
that has been passed down from ancient times.

82
00:05:43,683 --> 00:05:45,983
By drawing upon the length

83
00:05:45,983 --> 00:05:47,383
and loudness of the rice that is boiling in the pot,

84
00:05:47,383 --> 00:05:49,883
good or bad fortune is predicted.

85
00:05:56,183 --> 00:05:58,283
Ms. Mayuko, could it be...

86
00:05:58,283 --> 00:06:00,283
You regained your memory?

87
00:06:00,283 --> 00:06:01,983
Quiet.

88
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,983
You're the one who...

89
00:06:04,983 --> 00:06:07,683
Do you know her?

90
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:11,883
I don't know why I cried.

91
00:06:11,883 --> 00:06:15,483
Maybe she had a sounding boiling pot reading done before?

92
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:17,883
Yes, three days ago.

93
00:06:17,883 --> 00:06:20,683
That's a day before the robbery.

94
00:06:20,683 --> 00:06:22,683
Didn't she mention anything?

95
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,383
Well...

96
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:29,683
I want to start over from scratch by getting rid of my past.

97
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:32,383
I want to really stand on my own two feet this time.

98
00:06:32,383 --> 00:06:35,283
It seems you went on an introspective walk here

99
00:06:35,283 --> 00:06:37,183
and there around Okayama,

100
00:06:37,183 --> 00:06:39,183
the place where you were born and raised.

101
00:06:39,183 --> 00:06:43,783
I see. Now I understand why she visited the places that she sketched.

102
00:06:43,783 --> 00:06:46,583
We received more postings on our website again.

103
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,983
She was witnessed in Kurashiki too.

104
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,383
We immediately moved on to Kurashiki.

105
00:06:54,383 --> 00:06:57,383
"Kurashiki Grillwork"

106
00:06:58,383 --> 00:06:59,783
This drawing...

107
00:06:59,783 --> 00:07:02,483
Isn't this the grillwork of that window?

108
00:07:02,483 --> 00:07:06,383
I see, it was a drawing of Kurashiki grillwork.

109
00:07:06,383 --> 00:07:08,383
Kurashiki grillwork?

110
00:07:08,383 --> 00:07:10,683
It's a design exclusive of Kurashiki.

111
00:07:10,683 --> 00:07:13,483
You can see a lot of it if we go to the Bikan Historical District.

112
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:15,183
Bikan Historical District?

113
00:07:15,183 --> 00:07:18,783
"Bikan District"

114
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,383
There seems to be no mistake that Mayuko came here.

115
00:07:36,783 --> 00:07:38,683
What's the matter?

116
00:07:38,683 --> 00:07:41,283
He just asked me for directions.

117
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,283
Sonny, you try it.

118
00:07:46,283 --> 00:07:47,283
What?

119
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:55,383
"Handmade Sparrow-shaped Pancake Workshop"

120
00:07:58,983 --> 00:08:00,983
Why me?

121
00:08:00,983 --> 00:08:02,983
Conan, look this way.

122
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:09,483
Afterwards, we found places that matched the sketches

123
00:08:09,483 --> 00:08:11,083
that were drawn one after the other.

124
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,483
"Kuraho Memorial Hall"

125
00:08:17,683 --> 00:08:21,683
Ms. Mayuko's memory was coming back little by little.

126
00:08:25,283 --> 00:08:29,483
I've been here before.

127
00:08:29,483 --> 00:08:30,983
"Ohara Art Museum"

128
00:08:30,983 --> 00:08:32,983
Yes, here too.

00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:37,583
I remember.

131
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:41,483
And there were only two more sketches to go.

132
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:44,783
That's maybe...

133
00:08:44,783 --> 00:08:46,683
"Peach Boy Museum of Illusion"

134
00:08:46,683 --> 00:08:49,683
"Peach Boy Museum of Illusion" -I think it's here?

135
00:08:52,983 --> 00:08:54,783
When you turn the disc,

136
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,083
the number of ogres differ?

137
00:09:01,383 --> 00:09:02,583
What?

138
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,783
The grapes are gone

139
00:09:03,783 --> 00:09:05,983
and there are two bunches bananas instead.

140
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,483
It's because the picture of grapes are painted

141
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:13,183
on the face-up surface of this accordion shaped object,

142
00:09:13,183 --> 00:09:16,383
but on the surface facing downward, bananas are painted instead.

143
00:09:16,383 --> 00:09:19,383
I see. On the mirror that is placed below,

144
00:09:19,383 --> 00:09:22,583
the bananas that are drawn on the bottom are reflected.

145
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:23,683
Isn't it interesting to think that

146
00:09:23,683 --> 00:09:26,683
just by changing the angle a different thing can be seen.

147
00:09:26,683 --> 00:09:30,583

Mayuko, did you regain your memory?

160
00:10:44,016 --> 00:10:47,016
You recall where the jewelry is then, don't you?

161
00:10:48,016 --> 00:10:51,416
You finally spit it out.

163
00:10:54,116 --> 00:10:56,816

of the suspect of the robbery, Mr. Nonomiya Kengo, are you?

169
00:11:28,116 --> 00:11:29,116
Oh no?

170
00:11:29,116 --> 00:11:30,716
You gotta be joking?

171
00:11:30,716 --> 00:11:33,816
After thinking it out a little, it should've been obvious.

172
00:11:33,816 --> 00:11:36,016
In the case that the suspect denies the allegations,

173
00:11:36,016 --> 00:11:37,116
it is difficult for anyone except the lawyer

174
00:11:37,116 --> 00:11:39,516
to meet with the suspect, be it his relatives.

175
00:11:39,516 --> 00:11:41,216
Nevertheless...

176
00:11:41,216 --> 00:11:44,616
But when I visited him at the police,

177
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:46,816
my brother definitely told me

178
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:48,816
that he was innocent.

179
00:11:48,816 --> 00:11:52,616
No... I really...

180
00:11:52,616 --> 00:11:56,116
I know who you actually are, already.

181
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,416
Conan.

182
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,916
Yes, sir.

183
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,016
Look at this.

184
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:07,416
It's a contract for a loan.

185
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,216
Kanae Nishida?

186
00:12:09,216 --> 00:12:10,716
Ishida?

187
00:12:10,716 --> 00:12:12,816
Then, just as I thought?

188
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,816
You didn't play the role

189
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:18,716
of the suspect Nonomiya's younger sister to clear his charges.

190
00:12:18,716 --> 00:12:21,616
But rather because you wanted the jewelry, isn't that right?

191
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,116
Acting as his younger sister

192
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:25,816
will give you away as soon as someone checks on you.

193
00:12:25,816 --> 00:12:29,816
She was that desperate about her debts.

194
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,916
Exactly.

195
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:35,216
Some trashy man hoodwinked me into getting loans to support him.

196
00:12:35,216 --> 00:12:39,016
And the finance company also turned out to be a wicked one too.

197
00:12:39,016 --> 00:12:40,516
After midnight the day before yesterday,

198
00:12:40,516 --> 00:12:44,016
I visited Mayuko's apartment hoping to borrow money from her.

199
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:45,616
There...

200
00:12:45,616 --> 00:12:47,016
Where's the jewelry?

201
00:12:48,216 --> 00:12:50,116
How should I know?

202
00:12:50,116 --> 00:12:51,216
Come.

203
00:12:51,216 --> 00:12:52,316
Let me go!

204
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:05,816
I didn't know what was going on at that time but...

205
00:13:05,816 --> 00:13:06,916
The following day,

206
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,816
I saw the news about the jewelry robbery

207
00:13:08,816 --> 00:13:11,116
and everything fell into place.

208
00:13:14,816 --> 00:13:20,216
The remark of Mr. Nonomiya who that was aired on the news wasn't a lie.

209
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,916
That guy struck Mr. Nonomiya and set him up as a scapegoat,

210
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,816
and Mayuko was a witness to this, he said.

211
00:13:26,816 --> 00:13:28,516
Come to think of it,

212
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:32,716
everything but the part about Mayuko being the eye-witness

213
00:13:32,716 --> 00:13:35,016
was aired on the news.

214
00:13:35,016 --> 00:13:38,416
I don't know what happened between the two,

215
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:41,016
but I figured that Mayuko betrayed the man

216
00:13:41,016 --> 00:13:44,216
and hid the jewelry some place.

217
00:13:44,216 --> 00:13:45,416
If I play it right,

218
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,016
I thought I could also get rid of my debts.

219
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:52,016
That's why I rushed to look for Mayuko's whereabouts.

220
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:56,516
But, when I finally found her, Mayuko was suffering from memory loss.

221
00:13:56,516 --> 00:14:00,516
I was at a loss as to what to do.

222
00:14:00,516 --> 00:14:03,016
After that, I carelessly happened to tell

223
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:05,516
the president of the finance company who came to collect money

224
00:14:05,516 --> 00:14:08,916
"Osanai Norio (38)" -about the jewelry.

225
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,716
Then...

226
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:13,216
He conned you into act as Mr. Nonomiya's younger sister

227
00:14:13,216 --> 00:14:17,016
and contact us.

228
00:14:17,016 --> 00:14:20,916
So, that you would find out where the jewelry is from Mayuko,

229
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,616
after which they planned to take it away.

230
00:14:29,516 --> 00:14:31,316
Hello?

231
00:14:31,316 --> 00:14:32,816
Yes, that's right.

232
00:14:34,316 --> 00:14:37,916
Dad, it's from the Okayama Police.

233
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,116
They tracked the guy down with the license plate number

234
00:14:39,116 --> 00:14:40,516
that Conan reported

235
00:14:40,516 --> 00:14:42,516
to the police and arrested him, right?

236
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:46,116
Me, the one who robbed the jewelry store?

237
00:14:46,116 --> 00:14:47,816
Give me a break.

238
00:14:47,816 --> 00:14:52,216
All I did was try to snatch the jewelry from the side.

239
00:14:52,216 --> 00:14:55,616
My company's in hot water too,

240
00:14:55,616 --> 00:14:57,416
that's why I...

241
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,916
He seems to have admitted that he attempted to kidnap Ms. Mayuko

242
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,216
at the Bikan Historical District,

243
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:03,616
but he seems to be denying all else.

244
00:15:03,616 --> 00:15:06,416
I'm sure he's just trying to get away with it.

245
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,816
The man who attacked Mayuko at the observation deck

246
00:15:07,816 --> 00:15:09,816
was also that guy Osanai.

247
00:15:09,816 --> 00:15:12,416
Well, I wouldn't be so sure.

248
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,716
Ran.

249
00:15:13,716 --> 00:15:14,716
Yes.

250
00:15:14,716 --> 00:15:18,216
Do you remember any characteristics of the man who attacked Mayuko

251
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:20,016
at the observation deck?

252
00:15:20,016 --> 00:15:23,416
Characteristic?

253
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:26,216
Help, somebody!

254
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:29,416
Right. That man was left-handed.

255
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,916
Osanai is right-handed.

256
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:39,116
In other words, there were two people who were going after Mayuko.

257
00:15:39,116 --> 00:15:42,716
One was the right-handed man who cooperated with Mayuko

258
00:15:42,716 --> 00:15:44,716
and followed us,

259
00:15:44,716 --> 00:15:47,916
the president of the finance company, Osanai.

260
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:52,216
And, the other one is the jewelry store robber.

261
00:15:53,216 --> 00:15:56,116
The guy who attacked Mayuko at the observation deck,

262
00:15:56,116 --> 00:15:58,516
who on earth was he?

263
00:15:58,516 --> 00:16:02,516
Mr. Mouri, please cut the Gordian knot.

264
00:16:02,516 --> 00:16:05,216
In fact, the culprit was depicted

265
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:08,016
in the sketches drawn by Mayuko to begin with.

266
00:16:08,016 --> 00:16:10,316
What?

267
00:16:10,316 --> 00:16:13,116
Look at the last sketch.

268
00:16:13,116 --> 00:16:14,116
Yes.

269
00:16:15,216 --> 00:16:17,716
The sketch of the grapes.

270
00:16:17,716 --> 00:16:20,916
This depicts the culprit...

271
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:23,816
Come to think of it,

272
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,916
you mentioned you were a sommelier some time in the past?

273
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,216
Yes.

274
00:16:27,216 --> 00:16:28,716
If I'm not mistaken,

275
00:16:28,716 --> 00:16:32,016
sommelier's wear badges the shape of grapes, don't they?

276
00:16:32,016 --> 00:16:33,216
The shiny thing that was on the chest of the man

277
00:16:33,216 --> 00:16:35,816
in the picture at Mayuko's house, whose face was all torn off,

278
00:16:35,816 --> 00:16:38,816
wasn't that a sommelier badge?

279
00:16:38,816 --> 00:16:42,716
Besides, just before Mayuko was attacked at the observatory deck...

280
00:16:42,716 --> 00:16:46,716
I'm sorry, the editor just called me.

281
00:16:46,716 --> 00:16:49,016
I'll be back in about an hour,

282
00:16:49,016 --> 00:16:50,616
so please go on and eat without me.

283
00:16:50,616 --> 00:16:53,116
You excused yourself, didn't you?

284
00:16:53,116 --> 00:16:55,616
What's with that look in your eyes?

285
00:16:55,616 --> 00:16:57,516
Are you suspecting me?

286
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,216
The man at the observatory deck was hit on the head

287
00:17:01,216 --> 00:17:03,116
with the can that Conan kicked towards him. Mr. Nashida,

288
00:17:03,116 --> 00:17:06,916
why are you suddenly wearing a cap?

289
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,116
Just what are you talking about?

290
00:17:09,116 --> 00:17:12,916
I'm not hiding a wound or anything. See.

291
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,316
See.

292
00:17:14,316 --> 00:17:16,916
No. It's not Mr. Nashida.

293
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,716
What? Is that right?

294
00:17:18,716 --> 00:17:21,716
The sketch is depicted something else.

295
00:17:21,716 --> 00:17:22,716
Conan.

296
00:17:22,716 --> 00:17:27,416
Ran, the sketch of the grapes is not the sommelier badge but this.

297
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,016
This...

298
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:32,316
This is how you're supposed to look at it, right, pops?

299
00:17:36,616 --> 00:17:41,116
This is Mr. Taira's Muscat parfait.

300
00:17:41,116 --> 00:17:43,916
It's the same as the mirror trick.

301
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,116
When you change the angle,

302
00:17:45,116 --> 00:17:47,516
something different comes into view.

303
00:17:47,516 --> 00:17:51,116
Mr. Taira most probably left-handed.

304
00:17:52,116 --> 00:17:57,216
Conan watched Mr. Nashida and Mr. Taira shaking hands at the hospital.

305
00:17:57,216 --> 00:18:00,016
Mr. Nashida stuck out his left hand

306
00:18:00,016 --> 00:18:04,116
because he knew that Mr. Taira was left-handed. Isn't that right?

307
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:07,816
Yes. Exactly.

308
00:18:08,816 --> 00:18:10,616
Come to think of it,

309
00:18:10,616 --> 00:18:13,216
the man from that time was also left-handed.

310
00:18:14,216 --> 00:18:18,116
Mr. Taira, I think it's about time you come out.

311
00:18:18,116 --> 00:18:21,316
I know you've been listening from over there for some time now.

312
00:18:32,116 --> 00:18:33,516
Without money,

313
00:18:33,516 --> 00:18:35,116
I couldn't get a hold of a new shop.

314
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:39,116
The banks wouldn't lend me money either

315
00:18:39,116 --> 00:18:41,616
because I went out of business gambling.

316
00:18:41,616 --> 00:18:45,116
That's why I made Mayuko help and carried out the robbery.

317
00:18:45,116 --> 00:18:47,816
You mean Mayuko was an accomplice in the robbery?

318
00:18:47,816 --> 00:18:51,516
She probably helped keep on the look out, or drive the car?

319
00:18:52,616 --> 00:18:54,516
Yes, exactly.

320
00:19:03,116 --> 00:19:06,416
But, that guy happened to see what happened.

321
00:19:27,016 --> 00:19:32,116
You went ahead to Mayuko's apartment

322
00:19:32,116 --> 00:19:34,716
and caught her trying to get back the jewelry

323
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,916
but since Mayuko fell down the stairs

324
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:40,516
and you were surprised by Kanae's scream, you fled.

325
00:19:40,516 --> 00:19:43,116
After that when you found out from the website of the Town Magazine

326
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:45,616
that Mayuko was suffering from loss of memory

327
00:19:45,616 --> 00:19:49,416
and that I was investigating the case,

328
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,616
you got rid of the evidence that pointed to you

329
00:19:50,616 --> 00:19:53,916
and Mayuko having any connection with each other from her room

330
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:57,316
and got into contact with us under disguise

331
00:19:57,316 --> 00:19:59,916
in order to get the jewelry back.

332
00:20:09,516 --> 00:20:11,216
Hello.

333
00:20:11,216 --> 00:20:12,716
Yes, that's right.

334
00:20:14,516 --> 00:20:15,816
Really?

335
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:19,216
Dad, Mayuko disappeared from the hospital.

336
00:20:22,116 --> 00:20:23,116
Conan?

337
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:42,616
So, you did get her memory back after all.

338
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,716
Mr. Mouri?

339
00:20:44,716 --> 00:20:48,216
You mumbled the following at the Bikan Historical District.

340
00:20:48,216 --> 00:20:50,516
What a beautiful moon.

341
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:53,516
Back then, you were remembering

342
00:20:53,516 --> 00:20:57,916
the scenery that you once saw when you were there.

343
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:01,416
I tried time and time again to get back on my feet.

344
00:21:04,216 --> 00:21:09,216
But, each time, I was betrayed by the person I trusted.

345
00:21:09,216 --> 00:21:13,216
I fell in love with Taira and when he asked me run a shop together,

346
00:21:13,216 --> 00:21:15,416
I made up my mind that this time is the right time.

347
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:19,616
That's when Taira told me about robbing the jewelry store.

348
00:21:19,616 --> 00:21:22,016
If there was no way out of my situation I thought.

349
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:25,016
Why not take everything for myself?

350
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:29,416
I figured I'd become more evil plunge farther into the pits.

351
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,516
But you were crying

352
00:21:31,516 --> 00:21:34,216
after seeing the boiling pot ritual.

353
00:21:34,216 --> 00:21:36,316
You requested a reading wanting to get rid of your past

354
00:21:36,316 --> 00:21:38,816
and start over again.

355
00:21:38,816 --> 00:21:40,716
If you got your memory back,

356
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,216
I'm sure you can remember how you felt back then.

357
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:46,916
Ran was saying

358
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,316
I admire Ms. Mayuko.

359
00:21:49,316 --> 00:21:54,016
I'll bet she's actually a very strong person.

360
00:21:54,016 --> 00:21:55,416
Ran said that?

361
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,016
I'm sure that she's praying

362
00:21:57,016 --> 00:22:01,016
that you'd get back on your feet this time for sure.

363
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,516
The following day,

364
00:23:31,516 --> 00:23:34,216
Mayuko Kichise was arrested and from her testimony

365
00:23:34,216 --> 00:23:37,816
Mr. Keigo Nonomiya was released.

366
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:46,516
Finally... finally!

367
00:23:46,516 --> 00:23:48,816
I get to eat octopus rice and drink beer.

368
00:23:48,816 --> 00:23:52,816
Dad, we're going to miss our Bullet train.

369
00:23:52,816 --> 00:23:55,216
Oh, no!

370
00:23:55,216 --> 00:24:00,216
-Just come! -Octopus rice! Beer!
