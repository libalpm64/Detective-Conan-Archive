1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,570
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,270
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:06,970
How will Pops Kogoro's statement help the case?

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,070
How will it affect the Prosecution's, the Defense and Conan's case?

5
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,670
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,670
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,970
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,000
Ms. Kisaki and Ms. Kujo, the "Madonna" of the prosecutor's office

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,600
are to battle it out in court again.

10
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,900
The case is about the defendant is accused to breaking into an office

11
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,300
and when the victim found out, they fought,

12
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,700
he accidentally kills the victim during the struggle.

13
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,900
But Prosecutor Kujo claims that he did intend to kill the victim

14
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,900
and he is charged with burglary and murder!

15
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,000
Pops Kogoro and I start to investigate

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,600
and we discover something at the crime scene.

17
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,700
It can't be...

18
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,100
I knew it!

19
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,100
I don't get it.

20
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:41,300
The partition is blocking the way, I can't see you from here!

21
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,700
What did you say?

22
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,300
Mr. Akiyama, what is the meaning of this?

23
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,700
Watch it! Stop wandering around!

24
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,300
What's this?

25
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,600
That's it, I've got it now!

26
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,500
I've solved the mystery behind this case.

27
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,000
"Court Battle 2: Kisaki vs Kujo (Part 2)"

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Thank you for your help.

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,400
No problem. Was I of any help to your case?

30
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,300
Well, the police and the prosecutor's office

31
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,400
already went through the place thoroughly.

32
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,500
I didn't expect to find anything to overturn the case.

33
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,100
I see.

34
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,300
I know.

35
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,700
Why don't you come to my restaurant now and have something to eat?

36
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,000
I'll bring out a special wine.

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,600
No, that'd be too much.

38
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,400
He was nice enough to offer!

39
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,100
It wouldn't hurt to drop by!

40
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,900
Kogoro...

41
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,300
Have you forgotten, Ran's waiting for you at home?

42
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,800
Your daughter?

43
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes.

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,400
Why don't you ask her to come too?

45
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,700
Geez, that's nice of you.

46
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,600
The more the merrier when it comes to dining, I always say.

47
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,500
Thank you, we accept then.

48
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,000
This is a very good wine.

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,400
I'm glad you like it.

50
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,900
I like the atmosphere of your restaurant.

51
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,200
Thank you very much.

52
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,300
I'll be testifying at the next trial,

53
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,800
please go easy on me.

54
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,000
You found your father-in-law's body

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,500
when you went to return something he'd forgotten, didn't you?

56
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,800
Yes. He had dinner here and left without his glasses.

57
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
His glasses?

58
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,200
Yes, his reading glasses.

59
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,500
Take your time and enjoy your meal.

60
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
This restaurant looks fancy

61
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,500
but the pasta isn't very good, right?

62
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,700
You're right.

63
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,300
The olive oil is a little heavy.

64
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,300
By the way, how are things for the next trial going?

65
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,500
Not too good.

66
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,500
You'll lose unless you change your approach.

67
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,200
And what do you mean by that?

68
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,500
You won't get him off on the burglary and murder charge.

69
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,200
So you've to stress the fact that he did it out of love for his daughter

70
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,100
and that the victim was also at fault.

71
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,500
Are you saying I should accept the prosecution's charges

72
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,300
and ask for leniency due to extenuating circumstances?

73
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,800
What choice do you have?

74
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,200
Don't be ridiculous!

75
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,900
The defendant insists that he had no intention of killing him!

76
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,700
You believe everything your client tells you,

77
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,500
that's why "Madonna" always gets you in court.

78
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,700
Don't you tell me how to do my job!

79
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,700
I'm not helping you because I want to, you know?

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,200
Come on you two, that's enough!

81
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,500
Why do you always fight like this?

82
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,700
I'm sure that on the list of things found on the crime scene.

83
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,900
I'm sure it was in here somewhere.

84
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,300
Here it is!

85
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,900
I've found it.

86
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,100
The undeniable proof!

87
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,000
Conan?

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,200
What is it? Why are you looking through the files?

89
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,900
Well, something in here was bothering me.

90
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,500
What do you mean?

91
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,600
Look, see this list of things found on the crime scene...

92
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,900
Hey, you!

93
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,500
You keep messing around with important documents!

94
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,600
Good grief!

95
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,000
Well if you're going to be like that,

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,700
why don't you think of something that'll help mom?

97
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,000
She's so stubborn.

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,100
I hope "Madonna" beats her in court.

99
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,300
Just listen to you!

100
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,400
I'll bet you just don't have the confidence to beat Ms. Kujo.

101
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,700
You've got some nerve!

102
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,000
She's no match for me.

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,900
Then why don't you defend him?

104
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,700
He can't. Dad doesn't have a license to practice law.

105
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,600
Why can't he be a special counsel then?

106
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,100
What's that?

107
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,100
If someone with a license to practice law

108
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,600
or if the defendant makes a request,

109
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,100
the person they indicate can act as a lawyer.

110
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:06,200
Show the court how brilliant your deductive powers are.

111
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,400
My brilliant deductive powers?

112
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,300
Well, any crime can be solved by me.

113
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,700
If you insist, let me think about it.

114
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What? Him as special counsel?

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,100
Yes! He wants to help you so much, mom.

116
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,600
Thanks but no thanks.

117
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
But why?

118
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,700
Dad really wants to help!

119
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,100
So you say but I just don't think he has the ability.

120
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,300
But...

121
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,800
I have a message from Pops Kogoro,

122
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,300
he wants you and the building superintendent

123
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,800
to come to the crime scene tonight.

124
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,900
What? To the crime scene?

125
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,500
He said you'll see something

126
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,300
that will change the way things are going in court.

127
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,300
Change the way things are going in court?

128
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm sorry to have to put you through this again.

129
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,200
I don't mind but what do you want me to do?

130
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,700
I'm not too clear on that myself.

131
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,000
Mr. Akiyama.

132
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,500
Will you do exactly what you did that night?

133
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,100
Hey, Conan. Where is Kogoro?

134
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,500
He stepped outside to get things ready.

135
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,000
Outside?

136
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,600
"Takuya Akiyama (56)" -All right, I understand.

137
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
"Superintendent" -Just do exactly like the other night, right?

138
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,200
Let's see, there was no one here that night when I got here,

139
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,300
Mr. Arima looked through that little window

140
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,100
to see inside the office.

141
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,500
And he said somebody was inside, didn't he?

142
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,600
Yes, that's right.

143
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,500
So I took a look too and...

144
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,100
What is that?

145
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't believe it!

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,300
Impossible!

147
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,600
Is there somebody inside?

148
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,100
I don't understand.

149
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,100
Take a look for yourself, Ms. Kisaki.

150
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,700
What is that?

151
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,800
I set things up exactly like Pops Kogoro told me to.

152
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,700
Set things up?

153
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,600
Are you saying he knows who the killer is?

154
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,500
Yes, he said he'd explain everything in court.

155
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,600
"Second Trial of Burglary and Murder Case"

156
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,800
With mom and dad on the same side, we can't lose.

157
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,300
"Takashi Inoue (55)" -Who would have thought,

158
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,300
she'd ask Kogoro Mouri be appointed special counsel,

159
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,600
Attorney Kisaki must be really desperate.

160
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,700
All rise!

161
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,700
Mr. Akiyama.

162
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,300
You stated that you looked into the victim's office

163
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,500
through the small window

164
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,900
and saw him being beaten by the defendant,

165
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,800
is that correct?

166
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,400
Yes.

167
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,900
How many times did the assailant's strike the victim?

168
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,700
I saw three blows being delivered.

169
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,400
Shortly after that,

170
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,900
you heard the sound of the victim falling to the floor, correct?

171
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,900
Yes.

172
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,000
End of questioning!

173
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,600
Does the defense have any questions for the witness?

174
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,700
I do.

175
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,600
Mr. Akiyama.

176
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,100
You claim that you saw the victim being hit

177
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,200
but did you see the assailant's face?

178
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,900
No, I...

179
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,400
I didn't actually see the assailant's face.

180
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,700
What do you mean by that?

181
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,300
What exactly did you see then?

182
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,500
The light outside cast the assailant's shadow on the wall.

183
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,100
Order in the court!

184
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,100
So you're saying you merely saw the assailant's shadow, correct?

185
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,000
Yes, that's correct.

186
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,500
It's the same thing.

187
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,700
As long as he saw the assailant, seeing his shadow is good enough.

188
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,200
Let me ask you one more time.

189
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,700
Mr. Akiyama, is the defendant here,

190
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,900
the assailant you saw that evening?

191
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,900
No, like I said, I only saw a shadow on the wall.

192
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,700
So you're not sure that the defendant is the assailant then, correct?

193
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,100
Yes.

194
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,700
Thank you.

195
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,800
No more questions.

196
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,000
Gosh! What is dad doing?

197
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,900
He hasn't done anything except sleep.

198
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,200
Don't worry, his time will come.

199
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,900
Are you sure?

200
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,800
I would like to call Mr. Arima to the witness stand.

201
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,600
Mr. Arima, you and Mr. Akiyama heard

202
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,300
the sound of the victim falling, didn't you?

203
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,800
Yes, I'm certain of it.

204
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,000
The door was locked so you broke it down by ramming into it

205
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,800
and then ran inside.

206
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,200
Yes. But the assailant's had already escaped through the window

207
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,300
and my father-in-law,

208
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,900
I mean, Mr. Otsu was on the floor.

209
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,500
And what about the safe?

210
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,100
It was open.

211
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,500
No more questions.

212
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,300
Defense, your turn.

213
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,000
Here goes.

214
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,200
Guess it's time for me to liven up this boring trial.

215
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,600
Good luck, dad.

216
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,300
I'll see how he does first!

217
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:50,500
Special counsel, you may proceed to question the witness

218
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,600
Yes, sir!

219
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,400
Mr. Arima.

220
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,300
You claimed that you arrived at the victim's office a little past 9 pm

221
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,700
to deliver an item he'd forgotten, is that correct?

222
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,300
Yes, my father-in-law forgot his reading glasses at my restaurant.

223
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,200
But the office was locked and you couldn't enter.

224
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,000
That's right.

225
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,400
The door was actually unlocked, wasn't it?

226
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,300
And the victim was in his office

227
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,000
counting the money in the safe.

228
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What are you getting at?

229
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,800
Are you implying that I...

230
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,700
No, I'm merely pointing out the fact that

231
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,300
you could have committed the crime too.

232
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,300
Ridiculous!

233
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,500
Why would I kill my father-in-law?

234
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,200
When it comes to money,

235
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,900
you can't trust your own family.

236
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,000
Unlike usual, Pops Kogoro is actually making some sense.

237
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,300
Objection!

238
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,600
Special counsel is merely voicing his own opinion!

239
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,600
Objection granted.

240
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,800
Special counsel shall stick to the facts at hand.

241
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,100
But based on my many years of experience,

242
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,500
the first person to report the crime is usually the guilty one.

243
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,500
All right then, based on your many years of experience,

244
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,800
how do you explain the things left on the crime scene

245
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,700
and the defendant's fingerprints on the safe?

246
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,400
When the witness and the victim were fighting over money,

247
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,100
the defendant was looking in through the window, watching them.

248
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,100
Well, that's a new theory.

249
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,300
Then after the witness hit the victim over the head and left,

250
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,400
the defendant took the opportunity to enter the office

251
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,900
to steal the money in the safe.

252
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,600
Then who was the assailant Mr. Akiyama saw?

253
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,200
The truth is, the victim wasn't dead yet.

254
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,900
He regained consciousness and struggled with the defendant.

255
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,900
Hey, now you're going way off base.

256
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,100
What you're saying then is,

257
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,300
the defendant did indeed commit the murder

258
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,000
I guess I am.

259
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,600
What are you saying?

260
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,000
You're supposed to be here to defend the client!

261
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm a famous private detective!

262
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,800
I'm here to solve this case!

263
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,900
I was a fool to depend on you.

264
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,600
Forget it! You just keep out of my way!

265
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,400
How dare you? I'm not finished, I'm getting to the best part.

266
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,600
Family fuels should be carried out elsewhere.

267
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,500
I hate you, dad!

268
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,100
I guess it's time I took Pops Kogoro out.

269
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,300
You just sit down and keep your mouth shut!

270
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,300
Am I your decoration piece?

271
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,600
Your honor, I'd like to retract my previous statements.

272
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,900
Just forget it.

273
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,700
The defendant entered that office before Mr. Arima,

274
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,800
not after.

275
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,600
The victim walked in on him while he was trying to get the safe open,

276
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,500
he hit the victim inadvertently and ran out of the office.

277
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,000
The question is what happened after that.

278
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,400
The defendant thought he had killed the victim

279
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,800
but the truth is, he had just knocked him unconscious.

280
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,200
Someone else arrived on the scene shortly after and killed him!

281
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,800
Are you saying that it was me?

282
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,800
You claimed that the victim forgot his reading glasses

283
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,600
in your restaurant, isn't that correct?

284
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,800
Yes.

285
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,300
Did he need his reading glasses during meals too?

286
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,400
Well, he needs them to read the menu.

287
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,600
That's strange.

288
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,700
The indictment states that the victim opened the safe

289
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,900
because the defendant threatened him.

290
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,000
The victim didn't have his glasses,

291
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,600
I wonder how he managed to get the safe open

292
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,000
and his office was dark,

293
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
the only light was from the neon sign outside?

294
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,100
How should I know?

295
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,100
The victim was still alive

296
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,500
when you delivered his glasses, wasn't he?

297
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,300
Father, are you in?

298
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,400
What happened?

299
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,300
Your head's bleeding!

300
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,900
Leave me alone! It's nothing.

301
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,800
That was right after he wandered in on the burglar.

302
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,300
I'm sure when he regained consciousness,

303
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,300
the first thing he was concerned with was the money in the safe.

304
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,000
I have your glasses here.

305
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,800
When you saw the money,

306
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,200
you thought of killing him

307
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:33,300
and you hit over the head with the ashtray.

308
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,300
Prosecutor!

309
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,300
I came here as a witness.

310
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,200
Why am I being treated like a suspect?

311
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,400
Mr. Mouri, you've forgotten one very important detail.

312
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,600
The witness has an alibi.

313
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
You bet I do!

314
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,200
I was outside of the office when father was beaten

315
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,900
and fell to the floor,

316
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,300
Mr. Akiyama was with me.

317
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,300
Didn't you hear Mr. Akiyama's testimony?

318
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,900
He said that he never saw the assailant.

319
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,700
But he saw a shadow.

320
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,500
Yes, a shadow on the wall.

321
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,700
You committed murder blinded by the money,

322
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,000
now you had to make it look like a burglary, you were desperate.

323
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,500
Then you came up with an idea.

324
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,800
That is using the clock in the victim's office

325
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,100
that has a decoration attached on it.

326
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,300
Your honor!

327
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,500
This clock is exactly like the one in the victim's office.

328
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:39,000
The assailant's evidently used the movements of this figure

329
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,800
along with the light from the outside

330
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,600
and cast its shadow on the wall

331
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,100
then led Mr. Akiyama into mistaking the time.

332
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,800
What about the sound? Explain that!

333
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,300
Mr. Akiyama and I hear my father fall!

334
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,800
That's easy.

335
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,000
What?

336
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,400
You probably put a golf ball

337
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,300
tied with a string under the leg of the desk in the victim's office.

338
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,600
The other end of the string led under the door

339
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,100
to the outside of the office

340
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,000
and when Mr. Akiyama looked inside and got a scare,

341
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,900
you pulled the string.

342
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,100
See? Didn't I say it was easy?

343
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,300
Do you have any proof I did it?

344
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,200
Anyone could have done what you said!

345
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,900
If you have proof that I did it, I'd like to see it!

346
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,500
The witness is right.

347
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,000
If you're insisting he's guilty,

348
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,500
I'd like to see some proof too!

349
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,600
The proof, Prosecutor,

350
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,700
is on that list of things found at the crime scene that you're holding.

351
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,800
On this list?

352
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,600
It says screw for eyeglasses, doesn't it?

353
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,000
If it belongs to the victim's reading glasses,

354
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,300
when did it get where it was found?

355
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,500
He was supposed to have left his glasses at the restaurant.

356
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:06,100
It came loose and fell off when the assailant hit the victim,

357
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,800
that's the only explanation I can think of.

358
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,000
Another thing, Mr. Arima.

359
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,600
You used your cook's apron

360
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,100
to wipe your fingerprints off the ashtray, didn't you?

361
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,200
The lab report stated that the ashtray was wiped

362
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,200
with a cloth containing oil.

363
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,600
Requesting permission to have a sample of the olive oil

364
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,100
used in Mr. Arima's restaurant to be tested

365
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,700
against the oil on the cloth used to wipe the ashtray!

366
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,200
Mr. Arima, after the crime,

367
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,100
you repaid a loan of 50 million yen, didn't you?

368
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,300
We can always have that money tested for fingerprints.

369
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,200
He deserved it!

370
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,300
That abusive old man.

371
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,200
You must be relieved, your money's safe.

372
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
Do you want some of this?

373
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,600
But if you don't pay me back what you owe me by next week,

374
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,500
I don't care if you are my daughter's husband,

375
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,800
I'm going to have you kicked out of that restaurant!

376
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,300
Mr. Mouri, you were right about everything.

377
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,500
I killed my father-in-law!

378
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,900
Your honor,

379
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,900
I would like to revise charges of burglary and murder

380
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,800
against the defendant to attempted burglary

381
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,600
and I would like to press charges against Mr. Arima.

382
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,300
Does the defense have any objections?

383
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,900
None.

384
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,300
Then the court is dismissed!

385
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,400
Ms. Kisaki.

386
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
A terrible injustice was about to be made,

387
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,800
thank you for preventing it.

388
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,100
I was just doing my job

389
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,800
I'll be looking forward to seeing you in court again then.

390
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:40,100
Why don't we all go get something to eat to celebrate?

391
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,400
That reminds me, I'm hungry.

392
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,600
How about some delicious wine and Italian cuisine?

393
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,200
I think I'd like some Japanese rice wine and raw fish instead.

394
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,500
No wait, cold beer and some piping hot stew sounds good too.

395
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,300
Or Chinese cuisine with old Chinese liquor.

396
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,300
Who cares?

397
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,940
Next Conan Hint:

398
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,660
"Eyesight"

399
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,240
The next episode is the third travel mystery.

400
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,380
Come on to The Kanmon Strait!
