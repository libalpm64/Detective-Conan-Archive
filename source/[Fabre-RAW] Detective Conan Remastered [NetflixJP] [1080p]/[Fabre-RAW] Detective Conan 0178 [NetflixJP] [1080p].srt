1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,440
Just as flowing water has no form

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,240
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,340
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,140
The story takes a sharp turn.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,940
The secret of the Black Organization is coming to light.

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,540
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,490
On the way back from school,

10
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,990
Haibara and I ran into Gin's car.

11
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,790
One of the Black Organization members.

12
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,990
I set a transmitter and wiretap in his car

13
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,190
and pursue him!

14
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,390
However, Gin destroyed the wiretap when he found them.

15
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,990
They have realized the existence of Haibara!

16
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,190
We found out about their murder plans via wiretap.

17
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,090
So we headed to a farewell party of a movie director

18
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,190
which are held at the Haido City Hotel.

19
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,090
During the slide show at that hall,

20
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,190
the chandelier falls off from the ceiling,

21
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,390
and falls on top of a politician named Nomiguchi and dies.

22
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,690
Moreover, Haibara was kidnapped by someone,

23
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,590
and was locked up in the wine cellar of the hotel!

24
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,590
Listen, Kudo. Listen very carefully.

25
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,890
The word "Apo" in the Apotoxin 4869

26
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,890
that shrunk our body,

27
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,190
which stands for apoptosis.

28
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,490
In other words, it means the death of a program.

29
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,090
Yes. The cells have a self-destruction structure

30
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,090
and is existing because of a signal that keeps that in check.

31
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,290
Hey, Haibara.

32
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:17,190
But, this drug not only guides apoptosis,

33
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,390
it also waits for the activation of trimorphism

34
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,690
and increases cell multiplication efficiency.

35
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,090
Cut it out, Haibara!

36
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,190
I'll listen to all you have to say

37
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,890
after you get out of there.

38
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,590
Never mind, and just listen, will you?

39
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,690
Because I'm never going to be able to...

40
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,590
to talk to you again.

41
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,690
-What?

42
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:44,790
"Re-Encounter with the Black Organization (Solution Part)"

43
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,690
So I'm going to download the data of the drug into the MO,

44
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,890
and hide it here,

45
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,590
so come get it later, okay?

46
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,790
After they come to get me.

47
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,890
Hey.

48
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,990
Shinichi, in front there.

49
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,690
It's them.

50
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,690
Don't tell me they've come for Pisco.

51
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,790
No, no way!

52
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,890
Before the seven people are released,

53
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,490
the Inspector is supposed to call me.

54
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,890
Haibara, big trouble!

55
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,090
They're coming!

56
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,290
Hide in the fireplace or something for now.

57
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,290
Hey, what's up?

58
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,390
Hey!

59
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,690
Inspector! It's Kudo!

60
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,590
What? Black organization?

61
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,790
Pisco's not here.

62
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,090
He promised to meet us in 30 minutes.

63
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,790
But, we don't hear a thing from him

64
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,990
so we use the transmitter as a guide and come here,

65
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,590
only to find the computer and no sight of him.

66
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,190
Where on earth did he disappear to?

67
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,690
What's with this wine cellar anyway?

68
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:40,290
Probably a room that Pisco had kept, just in case.

69
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,790
If he failed to kill the guy at the hall,

70
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,190
he was probably going to kill the guy

71
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,090
some place else and bring him here.

72
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:52,290
I think we'd better get out of here really fast, Gin.

73
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,990
Yeah.

74
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,690
Hey?

75
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,390
Did they leave?

76
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,690
Yes.

77
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,790
And? What about your clothes?

78
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,190
You lewd bastard!

79
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,990
I'm dressed!

80
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,290
In the overalls that I found in the cellar,

81
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:22,290
I also have the MO with the data of the drug that I copied too.

82
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,090
What a surprise!

83
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,290
I wonder if that liquor called Paikal

84
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,190
has an enhancing factor

85
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,390
that quickens the speed of cell multiplication?

86
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,890
That's nothing to be relieved about,

87
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,990
because the effect is only temporary!

88
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,690
Get out of there from the chimney

89
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,190
before your body returns to that of a child!

90
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,290
Okay.

91
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:45,390
I feel just like Cordelia crawling out of the well.

92
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,890
Talk about a long way to go.

93
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,090
By the way...

94
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,590
Did you figure out who Pisco is?

95
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,390
No, not yet.

96
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,690
I don't have enough information.

97
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,290
Look, Shinichi.

98
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,290
Tomorrow morning's paper is on the internet!

99
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,690
I saw that a while ago, but I didn't see anything.

100
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,890
No, the place to look is the show biz section!

101
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,390
What?

102
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,190
The cameraman who was at the hall,

103
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,590
seems to have taken it just before the chandelier fell.

104
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,490
They are the two among the seven, right?

105
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,490
Wait a second! Maybe...

106
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,190
The traces of a burn!

107
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,990
Which means that this chain...

108
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,290
I see.

109
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,690
So, that's what it was.

110
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:39,590
"Haido City Hotel old building"

111
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,790
I'm out.

112
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,390
Good work, Ai!

113
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,690
Can you tell where you are?

114
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,690
It looks like a roof somewhere.

115
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,090
Is Kudo there?

116
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,190
No.

117
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,490
He was talking to Inspector Megure till just a while ago,

118
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,690
but he went rushing into the hotel.

119
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,990
Rushing in?

120
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,590
Don't worry!

121
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,590
He told me to relay this message to you,

122
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,190
"I figured out Pisco's identity!"

123
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,190
"I'll go pick you up right away"

124
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,790
"so stay put and wait for me."

125
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,190
I'm fine!

126
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,390
Even if I wanted to move, I'm so worn out.

127
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,790
I can't move an inch.

128
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,290
I missed you.

129
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,490
Sherry.

130
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,190
Gin.

131
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,390
Look.

132
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:57,890
Isn't it beautiful how the white snow flutters in darkness?

133
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,590
Bright scarlet blood that spreads over the snow.

134
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,890
That glasses and overalls you are wearing

135
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:09,090
to deceive us are miserable attire for dying.

136
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,490
But, this place is just a great place to die.

137
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,790
Am I right, Sherry?

138
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,790
I'm surprised that you guessed that

139
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:23,490
I was going to come out of this chimney.

140
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,790
It was your hair.

141
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,690
I found your reddish brown hair

142
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,890
near the fireplace.

143
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,590
I don't know if Pisco got you,

144
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,890
or if you snuck into that liquor cellar yourself,

145
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,090
But I hear you.

146
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:46,490
You trembling as you breathed from within the fireplace.

147
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:54,290
I could've killed you in that dirty fireplace,

148
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,590
but I thought I could at least let you die glamorously.

149
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,990
Well... Thank you very much.

150
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,790
For waiting for me in such a cold place.

151
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,290
Now, won't you tell me while your lips are still moving?

152
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,590
The trick that you used to disappear

153
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,890
from the gas chamber of the organization.

154
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,990
The wine cellar?

155
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,690
Yes. I think it's a room with a large fireplace in it.

156
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,890
I wonder if we had that kind of a room in this hotel?

157
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,490
Maybe it's in the old building that is going to be renovated soon?

158
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,490
Old building?

159
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:36,290
Yes! I heard that they're using one of the rooms there as a storage room.

160
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,990
A storage room? That's it!

161
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,190
Hey, wait, sonny?

162
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,890
I'm sure that Pisco is headed there too.

163
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,890
If he joins those two,

164
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,990
they'll find out that Haibara shrunk because of the drug.

165
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,590
Darn it! If only Inspector Megure could've

166
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,990
kept them confined for another five minutes.

167
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,990
What? Haibara was shot?

168
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,090
Right! On a roof somewhere by them!

169
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,490
Hurry and go there or...

170
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,390
Hey! Dr. Agasa...

171
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,290
Darn it! The battery's dead!

172
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,490
Haibara!

173
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:26,490
Gin, she won't talk.

174
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,590
We've got no choice.

175
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,860
I guess we'll just have to send her off.

176
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,890
To where we sent her older sister before her.

177
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,570
A needle?

178
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,570
Gin?

179
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,470
The chimney.

180
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,770
Get into the chimney.

181
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,770
Who are you? You're...

182
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,870
Hurry!

183
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,270
Gin!

184
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,470
What's the matter, Gin?

185
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,070
How wonderful!

186
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,270
I guess you don't remember because you were still a baby,

187
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,170
but I was on very intimate terms

188
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,470
with your parents who were scientists.

189
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,970
They told me a lot about the drug

190
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,370
that they were developing.

191
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,670
Who is he?

192
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:40,870
I didn't think you had developed it this far.

193
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:45,370
I'm sure that your parents who have died of an accident is truly happy about this too.

194
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,370
Who are you?

195
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,570
But this is an order.

196
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,870
No offense.

197
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,070
Shiho.

198
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,870
Holdit right there!

199
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,870
Mr. Masuyama.

200
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,470
Or, should I call you Pisco, instead?

201
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,370
Who are you?

202
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,470
You may think that you succeeded

203
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,270
in dropping the chandelier on Mr. Nomiguchi and made it look like an accident,

204
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,170
but you're not getting away with that.

205
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,870
You're the one who dropped it, right?

206
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,370
When you used the gun with a silencer!

207
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,870
Your target was the fluorescent paint that you painted on the chandelier

208
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,970
in advance.

209
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,770
When the lights in the room goes out for the slide show,

210
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,970
the glow of the chain could be seen!

211
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,070
Of course, if you fired just like that

212
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,070
then the people around you would notice

213
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,570
the sparks from your gun.

214
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,970
But if you cover the silencer with the handkerchief,

215
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:48,170
the handkerchief would go off when you fire your gun,

216
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,570
so the sparks wouldn't be visible!

217
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,970
You used the handkerchief that was handed out at the hall

218
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:59,170
probably because it would be hard to trace even if it was found later on.

219
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,570
Unfortunately...

220
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,870
Most of the guests who had received the purple handkerchief,

221
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,070
had already gone home,

222
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,670
and the suspects left were only the seven of you.

223
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,270
Mr. Tawara and Chris who were right below the chandelier

224
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:14,170
and couldn't aim at it are proven to be innocent.

225
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:17,370
Mr. Mihei, who spit out chain piece that was used as proof,

226
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,770
and Mr. Mugikura, who are being watched by the guests,

227
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,470
are also innocent.

228
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:26,370
Mr. Tarumi and Ms. Nanjo who were embracing each other just before the incident are out of the question.

229
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,670
In other words the only one who could've

230
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,970
committed the murder at the hall is...

231
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,470
only you, Mr. Masuyama!

232
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,670
There!

233
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,370
The reason Mr. Nomiguchi came below the chandelier

234
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:47,070
because fluorescent paint was painted on the floor too.

235
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,570
You probably told him that

236
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,170
you can give him a chance to avoid arrest,

237
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:53,470
so he should wait for you at the place that glows

238
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,370
when the lights go out.

239
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,270
Isn't that right, Pisco?

240
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,770
A speaker?

241
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,470
Who are you?

242
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,770
Who the heck are you?

243
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,170
Conan Edogawa.

244
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,570
A detective!

245
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,570
A detective?

246
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,670
Don't tell me

247
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,570
that you're the one who called the police

248
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,670
while we were being questioned?

249
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,470
You and the other two at the rooftop

250
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,870
will be arrested by the police anyway.

251
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,370
Before that, I'd like you to tell me,

252
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,670
why did you have that purple handkerchief on you

253
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,870
during questioning?

254
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,870
That's why the Inspector had no choice but to release you.

255
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,170
Why did you have that handkerchief...

256
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,670
There are things in this world that you don't need to know about.

257
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,670
Besides, take a good look at the situation!

258
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,770
You couldn't have called the police.

259
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,970
You had better take a good look at yourself.

260
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,570
At your feet!

261
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,070
Spiritas.

262
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:59,270
It has an alcohol content as strong as 96%!

263
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,670
You understand, don't you?

264
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,470
What will happen if you smoke in a place

265
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,770
where such liquor is evaporating?

266
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:05,870
What?

267
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:16,370
A fire broke out from room 404 of the old building.

268
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,570
I repeat,

269
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,770
A fire broke out from room 404 of the old building!

270
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,870
What?

271
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,370
Let's go check it out!

272
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,170
Okay.

273
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,270
Hey, brat! Where are you?

274
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,170
Come out here! Darn it!

275
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,270
Where the heck are you!

276
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,970
So, that's where you are.

277
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,470
Just what do you think you're doing, Gin?

278
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,970
Have you gone senile, Pisco?

279
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,270
Why didn't you kill that cameraman right away

280
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,570
and get rid of the film?

281
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,170
Cameraman? What're you talking about?

282
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,070
The picture for the front page of tomorrow newspaper

283
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:58,370
has been switched to your face.

284
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:02,070
It shows you pointing the gun at the ceiling!

285
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,670
Don't!

286
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,870
If you kill me, you won't be able to find Sherry.

287
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,970
I have an idea of where she is.

288
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,670
Besides if you kill me, who has served that person,

289
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,670
you'll get yourself in trouble too.

290
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,270
I'm sorry.

291
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,070
But I just got orders personally

292
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:21,270
from that person a while ago to kill.

293
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,970
What?

294
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,670
You borrowed the power of the organization

295
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,470
and made it all the way up here.

296
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:30,070
I'll bet you've already seen enough good dreams.

297
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,270
Dream the rest of your dream in the world beyond.

298
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,270
What? Gin shot Pisco to death?

299
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,670
Yeah. I heard this through the glasses

300
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,570
that Ai left by the fireplace,

301
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,070
but it seems that he fled from the chimney

302
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,670
right after shooting the guy.

303
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,570
Strange!

304
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,670
Why can he move despite being shot with the tranquilizer gun?

305
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,870
I figured that though such a big man

306
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,970
he wouldn't be able to flee from the police

307
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,270
if he fell asleep.

308
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,270
And it also bugs me that

309
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:11,070
they knew too much of what Haibara was planning to do.

310
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,970
It seems that they knew that Haibara was going to be at the hall,

311
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,270
and besides can you tell who the person is just by looking at a strand of hair?

312
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,670
Hey, Haibara?

313
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,570
When you were at the organization...

314
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,370
And?

315
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,070
Did they find out?

316
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,770
The fact that I shrank?

317
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,370
No, I don't think so.

318
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,770
No need for worry.

319
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,970
And what do you intend to do from now on?

320
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,770
Well...

321
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:45,070
As long as they know I'm hiding in this town,

322
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:48,370
I can no longer stay near all of you.

323
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,870
And besides, the MO that I had in the overall

324
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,970
probably went up in flames too,

325
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:58,070
that I have no reason to stay here anymore.

326
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:01,470
Don't worry, I'll leave by tomorrow.

327
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,870
Hey... You can't possibly leave in your condition!

328
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,070
All right!

329
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,970
Don't worry about that!

330
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,670
What?

331
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,770
You're not going to look for her here in this town?

332
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:21,470
Yes. I'm a shogun who hates to waste time.

333
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,570
She probably have ran away

334
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,470
with the man that saves her by now.

335
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,770
She's not stupid enough to stick around in this town

336
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:32,670
knowing that we know what she looks like!

337
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,970
My?

338
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:38,070
You're really into that young lady, aren't you?

339
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,970
Well, I'm so sorry, Vermouth.

340
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,070
A woman of your rank was called in

341
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,370
just to assist that old man,

342
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,070
and all he ends up doing is messing up the plan.

343
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,370
Really. I went out of my way

344
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:55,470
to give him the handkerchief before questioning and yet...

345
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,670
He did right to die.

346
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,870
Doesn't it bother you?

347
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,370
The guy who's sticking around with that young lady.

348
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,370
Yeah.

349
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,270
I sure would like to see the face of the guy

350
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,670
that's drooling all over her.

351
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:16,570
Yes. His dead face distorted with fear.

352
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,870
Are you going back to the States again?

353
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:25,970
No, I'm going to rest working as an actress for a while.

354
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,470
I'm going to take it easy in Japan.

355
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,570
Besides, I have something that concerns me too.

356
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,570
At any rate, Inspector!

357
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,570
Please don't leak the fact that I was involved in this case.

358
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,270
That's all right with me.

359
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,370
But what is going on anyway?

360
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:16,070
Mr. Nomiguchi, the victim, family disappears,

361
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,770
and the house of Chairman Masuyama, the suspect,

362
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,170
burns down completely.

363
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,770
I don't have the slightest idea what is going on.

364
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,270
I can't tell you anything just yet!

365
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,070
I'll contact you when I figure it out.

366
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,270
Hey! Kudo?

367
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,270
Yes.

368
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:34,370
Get rid of anybody and anything is suspicious.

369
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,570
This is the way they carry out their plan.

370
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,370
Now you know, don't you?

371
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,370
That we can't afford

372
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:42,670
to have anybody know our true identity.

373
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,670
Yeah! I understand it very clearly.

374
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:49,470
That I've got to crush them all no matter what the cost!

375
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,100
Next Conan's Hint:

376
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,120
"Bus timetable"

377
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,440
Next episode will be the return of The Youth Detective Squad.

378
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,060
It looks like I can take a break.

379
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,600
Come on, help us out.
