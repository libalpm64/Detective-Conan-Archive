1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,560
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,360
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,060
What a surprise. Those two will appear.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,960
They reach the platform where danger awaits them.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,560
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,560
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,860
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,520
The North Star number three, an overnight express train

9
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,720
heads on for Hokkaido with all of us on board.

10
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,620
While the train was passing through the Seikan Tunnel,

11
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,120
Keitaro Izumo, the owner of a jewelry shop

12
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,020
is shot in the head and dies.

13
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,320
The killer cracks the window of his room

14
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,420
and flees out the train.

15
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,220
A while later, the corpse of the man thought to be the killer,

16
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,020
Yasuji Asama is found in the tunnel.

17
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,320
This incident

18
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,820
is progressing exactly as it is written in the unpublished novel

19
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,720
that was written by Dad!

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,020
Why don't you reveal your true identity?

21
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,620
You've been busted already.

22
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,520
Lady.

23
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:27,920
"Murder on the North Star Number Three (Part 2)"

24
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,120
So, you've figured out who I am after all.

25
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,020
"Yukiko Kudo" -Just as expected of you, Shinichi.

26
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,620
What made you think you could fool your own son

27
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,920
by just changing the color of your lipstick and hairdo?

28
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,520
Oh, my. But I went through everything to set my hair like this.

29
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,120
So, why did go as far as to disguise yourself

30
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,020
and get on board this train?

31
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,620
Gosh, I have to disguise myself!

32
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,520
After all, I am famous here in Japan, you know.

33
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,720
That was years ago.

34
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,920
Oh, quiet!

35
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,520
I got on board this train

36
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,520
because I read an article in the Japanese paper in Los Angeles.

37
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,220
That weird article said,

38
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,820
"Robber robs jewelry shop and flees without taking a thing,

39
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,820
leaving strange remark behind."

40
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,520
So, it's just a I thought.

41
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,120
Yes, Yusaku was saying so, too.

42
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,020
The sloppy job of a professional robber.

43
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,820
And the mysterious phrase,

44
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,620
"Nobody told me," that the robber said before fleeing.

45
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,020
That it's just like the opening of the suspense novel

46
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,120
that he wrote 10 years ago.

47
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,020
But the place that was robbed in the novel was an antique shop,

48
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,020
not a jewelry shop.

49
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,120
And then what?

50
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,220
Of course, we called the jewelry shop.

51
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,720
And asked if the owner of the shop had any plans

52
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,220
of riding an overnight train

53
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,020
that'll be going through a long tunnel.

54
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,320
Because according to the story,

55
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,020
the owner of the antique shop

56
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,220
was supposed to be killed on board the train.

57
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,520
That's when we found out

58
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,220
that he was going to be boarding the North Star in six days.

59
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,620
Why didn't you stop him?

60
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,620
I didn't think that a murder was going to be committed

61
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,020
while I was using the restroom.

62
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,620
Then, why didn't you at least let me know?

63
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,020
But you're always with Ran.

64
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,020
Nevertheless, you could've thought of something, couldn't you?

65
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,820
Then, are you saying that I'm to blame for him being killed?

66
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,320
No, that's not what I'm saying, but...

67
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:43,220
And just where is that source of all this nuisance causing novel?

68
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,220
He's already probably reached Sapporo

69
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,620
on the North Star before this!

70
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,320
When we called the jewelry shop,

71
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,220
they only told us that the owner was scheduled

72
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,820
to board one of the three North Stars that depart daily,

73
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,820
so Yusaku boarded number one and I got on number three.

74
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,970
Since the remaining North Star number two

75
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,570
goes through the tunnel in the morning,

76
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,970
we ruled it out.

77
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,270
I see.

78
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,470
So, it's more convenient to set the trick up at night.

79
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,070
And? Just what kind of trick is it supposed to be?

80
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,370
You asked Dad about it, didn't you?

81
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,770
Well...

82
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,370
What? He forgot the trick?

83
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,070
Well, it was 10 years ago.

84
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,170
And besides, only first part of the novel was finished

85
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,470
when the novel was stolen.

86
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,270
Stolen?

87
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,370
Yes.

88
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,870
The person of the editing office who had the manuscript

89
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:47,570
got involved in a bank robbery, and his bag was robbed.

90
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,970
Hey, don't tell me that the robber was...

91
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,970
Yes, that's right!

92
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,670
The robbers were a group of three men,

93
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,570
and the name of their boss was...

94
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,570
Yasuji Asama.

95
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,170
The man that was found dead in the tunnel a while ago.

96
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,370
But isn't it strange?

97
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,970
Why would the boss of the group of robbers

98
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,570
who stole the novel be killed just like in the novel?

99
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,970
That's true...

100
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,870
Hey, Conan!

101
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,870
Ran!

102
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,970
Just what are you doing here?

103
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,470
I was just talking to this lady...

104
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:28,770
You were talking to this young lady, right?

105
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,070
Yes.

106
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,170
Let's go to the lobby compartment!

107
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,170
Dad is going to put on a deduction show.

108
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,570
Oh, my. He's raced us to it.

109
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,170
Hopefully.

110
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,270
A deduction show?

111
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,570
Are you saying that the killer isn't Yasuji Asama,

112
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,570
the one who was found dead in the tunnel?

113
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,970
Yes, the killer is Yasuji Asama.

114
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,670
So then, just what are you going to deduce?

115
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,670
The motive.

116
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,770
Motive?

117
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,970
Yes.

118
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,770
The key to solve this case is Asama's remark,

119
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,470
"Nobody told me," right after he tried to rob Mr. Izumo's shop

120
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,370
and fled.

121
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,070
At this point, this case is incomprehensible.

122
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,570
But if this incident were to have been set up

123
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,670
by Mr. Izumo and Asama,

124
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,470
everything falls into place.

125
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,670
What?

126
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,770
Mr. Izumo probably conned Asama into robbing his shop,

127
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:33,270
then returning all the items that was robbed.

128
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,770
And that in return,

129
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,870
the exhorbiant insurance money covering the jewellery

130
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,770
would be shared between them.

131
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,270
But when he was robbed,

132
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,270
Mr. Izumo pushed the burglar alarm

133
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,470
and got rid of the robber, didn't he?

134
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,170
Mr. Izumo had no intention

135
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,970
of letting the robber rob his shop in the first place.

136
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,370
-Huh? -It was a trap he set up...

137
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,470
to attract attention and take advantage of

138
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:02,470
for the upcoming mayoral election.

139
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,270
However, unfortunately, Asama got away.

140
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,870
Then, Mr. Izumo receives a call from Asama

141
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,070
who he was fearing would take revenge.

142
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,770
Asama tells him to get on board North Star number three

143
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,370
to talk over the deal again

144
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,170
without the presence of the police.

145
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:23,670
Mr. Izumi who was summoned, was shot by Asama.

146
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,470
And Asama who tried to flee from the window

147
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,770
fell to his death.

148
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:33,770
Come to think of it, wasn't it after the robbery

149
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,770
that the owner said he wanted to board the North Star, Mrs. Izumo?

150
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,770
Yes, he was planning to go by plane,

151
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,470
but suddenly changed plans.

152
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:44,970
How did Mr. Izumo get to know Asama in the first place?

153
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,970
Maybe it's "that", don't you think?

154
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,270
Remember the scandal that was in the newspapers

155
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,470
about Mr. Izumo being a drug pusher some time ago?

156
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,070
He's been cleared of that suspicion ages ago!

157
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,870
But according to the Mr. Detective,

158
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:03,270
it seems to be true that he's into something that isn't all clean.

159
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,370
Well, I guess we should be thankful

160
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,070
that such a man was kept from becoming the next mayor.

161
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,170
You've got the nerve to say something like that

162
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,970
-right before my very eyes, -Now, now.

163
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,170
If this were an ordinary crime,

164
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,270
it would probably be just as Pops says.

165
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,970
But this case is obviously

166
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,370
progressing the way Dad wrote in his novel.

167
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,670
Officer.

168
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,870
They used to be in a group of three robbers in the past, right?

169
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,970
Yes.

170
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,170
-Did you get all their names? -No.

171
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,270
We got the names of the boss, Asama, and the woman.

172
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,770
But as to the name of the other one, nothing yet.

173
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,870
But Asama robbed the jewelry shop alone the other day,

174
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:50,670
so the other one probably decided to quit doing bad things.

175
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,870
Which means that

176
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:56,170
one of the members of the group may be here among us.

177
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:00,070
Which means it's the guy who read Dad's novel.

178
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,870
This is the diagram of the rooms.

179
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,870
If there is a way to move from room to room

180
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,170
without anybody noticing, then...

181
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,270
Wait a second.

182
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,170
What if some kind of tool were to be used?

183
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,570
Mrs. Azusa has a shot gun that she uses for clay shooting.

184
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:21,570
Mr. Kaetsu had a fishing kit for lure fishing.

185
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,970
Mr. Aoba had kendo wear and a bamboo sword.

186
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,670
Mr. Ishizuchi had a golf set.

187
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,070
I get it.

188
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,370
If Asama's corpse was thrown out of the window

189
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,970
before Mr. Izumo was shot to death,

190
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,870
we could've been deceived if that were used.

191
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,270
Inspector Nishimura!

192
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,770
We got a report from the site saying that

193
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,370
they've figured out the time Asama fell into the tunnel

194
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,270
from the train.

195
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,370
From the speed at which the train was moving

196
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,670
and the position at which the corpse was found,

197
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,170
it is estimated to be around 4:10 am.

198
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,870
It's just about the same time

199
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,120
that the witnesses say

200
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,620
they saw the killer flee into his room.

201
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,920
It can't be!

202
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,720
So, does that mean that the killer

203
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,220
threw the corpse out of the window in such a short time

204
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,920
and disappeared?

205
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,320
That 's impossible!

206
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,520
No human could perform such a feat!

207
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,520
What kind of trick did you think up of, Dad?

208
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,120
They still haven't been able to find the pieces of glass

209
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,620
that have been shattered.

210
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,320
Tell them to look harder!

211
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,720
They seem to also have found something strange on the belt hole

212
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,420
on the back of the slacks that the victim was wearing.

213
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,820
Something strange?

214
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,920
Yes.

215
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,920
A crumpled piece of masking tape.

216
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,620
Wait a second.

217
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,120
If an object that shape were to be there...

218
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,420
If it were to be there...

219
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,620
I found it. There it is!

220
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,620
The killer used this!

221
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,020
I am sure that person is the killer.

222
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,320
That person killed Mr. Izumo

223
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,620
and framed Asama up to make him look like the killer.

224
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,920
The structure of this North Star

225
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,720
and the Seikan Tunnel was used to the utmost advantage.

226
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,220
What's up, Shinichi?

227
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,420
I've figured everything out from A to Z.

228
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,720
The stupid trick that Dad wrote in his novel.

229
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,720
The young man wearing black rimmed glasses

230
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,920
smiled a smile of victory.

231
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,820
You're fantastic!

232
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,820
Now you can take the conceit out of Yusaku!

233
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:42,220
Did a young man wearing glasses come out in that novel?

234
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,220
Oh, yes!

235
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,720
An obnoxious guy boasting to be a detective!

236
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,320
If I'm not mistaken, he carries himself too far and...

237
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,920
Not even knowing that he would be taking his own life

238
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,320
because of his power of deduction.

239
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,720
Hey, hey.

240
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,120
Don't tell me that's...

241
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,910
Don't be silly, Shinichi.

242
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,510
No matter how much the incidents are progressing like the novel,

243
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:14,110
you won't be killed, Shinichi.

244
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,710
The idiot was killed by the killer

245
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,010
because he was so engrossed over him

246
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,310
despite having no proof.

247
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,110
That character is totally different from you, Shinichi!

248
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:27,210
I don't think that I'd be killed,

249
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,310
although the circumstances do look similar.

250
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,910
I don't have the proof.

251
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,310
I've figured out how the guy disappeared from the room,

252
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,510
and how he committed the crime.

253
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:43,510
But I don't have decisive proof that he is the killer yet.

254
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,710
You can't nab him then!

255
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,010
I'm sure that the proof

256
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:52,010
is still inside that person's luggage.

257
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:55,510
But since Yasuji Asama is thought to be the killer,

258
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,610
I can't ask them to show me their bags at this point.

259
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:02,110
There's one way you can carry that out!

260
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,810
Just let things progress just like in the novel.

261
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:11,210
What? You saw something strange in front of Asama's room?

262
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,710
Are you serious?

263
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,110
Yes.

264
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,610
It was a little before the incident occurred.

265
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,510
I think it was just before the train entered the Seikan Tunnel.

266
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,610
I saw this strange looking long thing

267
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,410
in front of the room of the person called Asama.

268
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,110
A long what?

269
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,210
I forgot.

270
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,110
Now, come on, lady

271
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,010
But please don't worry.

272
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:39,910
I'm sure I'll remember in time.

273
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,710
Isn't that right? You know who...

274
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,610
Sapporo, Sapporo.

275
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,810
Listen, Shinichi.

276
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,810
I'll be hanging around,

277
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,710
so don't lose sight of me, okay?

278
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,710
Okay. If he comes close,

279
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,210
I'll put him to sleep with my anesthetic gun.

280
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,410
This is very exciting, isn't it?

281
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,710
Hey, lady.

282
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,310
Conan?

283
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,710
I am counting on you.

284
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,910
Gosh. What are you doing, Conan?

285
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,110
Come, let's go!

286
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,910
I'm sure Natsue and the others are already here to see us.

287
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,410
Huh?

288
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,810
I think I forgot something on the train.

289
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,810
I'll ask the conductor to look for it for me,

290
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,210
so wait for me!

291
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,410
Hey, wait!

292
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:36,610
Mom...

293
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,210
Oh, there she is!

294
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:41,310
Gosh. Why are you on the other side?

295
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,410
Why can't she just hang around close by?

296
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,610
Oh, no!

297
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,010
Mom, behind you!

298
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,310
Darn it!

299
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,810
Shinichi, why are you over there?

300
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:57,010
Weren't you going to protect me?

301
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:00,610
The train will soon arrive at platform number seven.

302
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,810
Please step behind the white line.

303
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:09,310
The killer sneaks silently up behind the young detective

304
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,210
and with his blood-stained hands

305
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,510
and lightly pushes the vulnerable back of the detective

306
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,810
and covers the entire platform with blood.

307
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,710
Although the story hasn't end yet,

308
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,210
but I would like to place my pen down here.

309
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:30,310
It is much too meaningless to continue any further.

310
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,110
Honey, how did you...

311
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,510
I got the details from Inspector Nishimura who arrived a while ago,

312
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:40,810
confirmed everything and came here.

313
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,310
The one who killed Mr. Izumo,

314
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,010
the owner of the jewelry shop in the train,

315
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,410
and also killed Asama,

316
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,810
framing him up as the one who killed Izumo...

317
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,410
Mr. Kaetsu.

318
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,310
It could only be you.

319
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,810
What a ridiculous thing to say.

320
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,210
The man called Asama is the killer!

321
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,910
Witnesses have seen him shoot the owner

322
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:08,010
and flee from the window, too.

323
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,410
The Asama that the witnesses saw

324
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,910
was most likely you in disguise.

325
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:16,610
He was a robber on the run to begin with.

326
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,710
There is nothing easier for him

327
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,310
than to hide face and go around.

328
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:26,210
Then, how are you going to explain him fleeing out of the train?

329
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,910
I was in the train right through!

330
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,510
You just made it look that way.

331
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:37,810
By using that fishing set behind you!

332
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:42,110
After you hit Asama and killed him in your room beforehand,

333
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,410
you pulled a fishing line through the hole of the belt

334
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,810
behind the corpse's slacks,

335
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,610
and suspended outside from the cracked window.

336
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:52,210
You pulled both ends of the line to your room

337
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,510
and tied one end of it somewhere

338
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:57,310
and fastened the other end to the reel and secured it.

339
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,110
With that, everything is prepared.

340
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:02,510
After killing the owner in the lobby compartment,

341
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,210
you went to Asama's room,

342
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,410
and fired your gun at the window.

343
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,510
You also fired a threatening shot to Mr. Mouri who were watching you.

344
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,010
And while they flinched from your attack,

345
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,610
you hid by the stairs

346
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,810
and cut the end of the fishing line

347
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,110
that wasn't connected to the reel

348
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,910
and rewound it quickly.

349
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,010
Then, Asama's corpse slides down outside the train.

350
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,610
This way, the time when the killer runs into the room

351
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:27,010
and the time when Asama falls inside the tunnel matches.

352
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:32,210
Therefore, you get to set Asama up as the killer.

353
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,510
But Detective Mouri saw the door of the room close

354
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,810
at the same time he got to the room!

355
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,910
I am sorry, I forgot to mention that.

356
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,710
There was a key-shaped metal object by the door, wasn't there?

357
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,710
You stuck a vinyl tape with another fishing line tied to it

358
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,310
to the inside of the door,

359
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,710
and hooked that onto the metal object

360
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,510
tying it onto the fishing line that you would be cutting.

361
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,210
So, when you cut the line,

362
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,510
the line that is attached to the door is pulled

363
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,610
from the weight of the corpse.

364
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,710
Although the vinyl tape will peel off,

365
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:04,510
the door will spring back automatically and close on its own.

366
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:08,010
As proof of that, there seems to have been vinyl tape

367
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,610
stuck onto the belt hole that was holding the corpse.

368
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:14,010
But I am not the only one who could've used that trick.

369
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,110
Huh?

370
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:20,410
That bad man's clothes is in your bag!

371
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,110
Oh, there are sunglasses and a hat in here, too.

372
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,310
I wonder why?

373
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,310
Sonny.

374
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,610
I am sorry, Mr. Kaetsu.

375
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:31,210
But the greatest weak point of this trick

376
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,810
is that you cannot get rid of the clothes

377
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,410
that was used to disguise yourself.

378
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,310
If your bags are checked,

379
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:39,310
there is no way you can get away.

380
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:44,610
I guess I was trying to get the frosting and the cake

381
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,810
making everything turn out like in the novel.

382
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,510
I thought it would go well

383
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:52,810
because it was unpublished work of my favorite novelist.

384
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:56,310
This is just what I think,

385
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,610
but your motive is probably to avenge

386
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,010
the death of your comrade woman robber,

387
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:04,210
who died of drugs, isn't it?

388
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,910
Your targets were Mr. Izumo,

389
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,910
who was pushing drugs behind the scene,

390
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,110
and Yasuji Asama, the boss of the group of robbers

391
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:14,010
who got the woman hooked on drugs.

392
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,210
And you happened to realize

393
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,510
that the novel you got a hold of in the past

394
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,310
was so much like the predicament that you were in

395
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:25,310
that you decided to carry out your murder plan.

396
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,510
Who on earth are you?

397
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,510
Excuse me for not introducing myself.

398
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,510
I am Yusaku Kudo,

399
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,510
the author of that novel.

400
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,310
No way...

401
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,210
If...

402
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:44,610
If you felt in any way moved by my novel,

403
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,310
l'll recommend you to turn yourself in.

404
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,710
Because the killer in that novel in the end

405
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,410
was scheduled to turn himself into the police

406
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,610
after regretting all that he did.

407
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,010
Yes.

408
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,210
"New Chitose Airport" -Oh, my. Shinichi!

409
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,510
You've come out of your way to see us off?

410
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:38,810
No. I came to give Dad a piece of my mind!

411
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:42,810
I just wanted to let you know that I solved all your tricks!

412
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,010
That's right!

413
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,810
What a predicament to have your own son see through your tricks!

414
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,510
Maybe you should give up your name

415
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,710
as the world's greatest novelist already?

416
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,410
Oh, I am sorry.

417
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,010
I made all that up!

418
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,510
I set a trap up to deceived the readers!

419
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,910
-What? -The manuscript was only halfway through,

420
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,510
so he must've mistakenly used it.

421
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,110
I am sure I worked the trick out

422
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,610
so that the outfit used for disguise also disappears.

423
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,110
I sure hope you're not lying to me.

424
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,110
But I sure sense fate,

425
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:14,210
for you to come and save me just in the nick of time.

426
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:16,310
In the nick of time?

427
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,410
I was there near you from about two minutes

428
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:19,510
before everything happened.

429
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,410
Huh? Then what?

430
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,410
You mean you waited doing something

431
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,210
until I was almost pushed?

432
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:29,610
Yes. I wanted to be sure that he was the killer.

433
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:34,210
Besides, the stage of the novel was the Seikan Tunnel.

434
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,310
So, I silently watch over you.

435
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,710
He gives me the shivers.

436
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:45,610
It is Hokkaido, after all.
