1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,480
Alibis, secret codes, tricks and deals.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,580
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,780
An audience of 50,000 taken hostage.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,780
For both the match and the case, the end draws near.

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,380
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,380
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,680
His name is Detective Conan.

8
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,990
"January 1st, National Stadium, Emperor's Cup Finals"

9
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,090
We the members of the Youth Detective Squad

10
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,190
went to watch the Emperor's Cup game finals.

11
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,190
A bullet is fired into a soccer ball

12
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,690
right before the very eyes of the five children.

13
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,790
Just then, the director of Nichiuri TV

14
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,090
receives a threatening phone call,

15
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,090
while they are broadcasting the game.

16
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,990
The blackmailer says, "Get 50,000,000 yen ready.

17
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:21,990
If you cancel the game or let anybody out of the stadium,

18
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,990
I'll fire and kill indiscriminately."

19
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,690
The criminal demands ransom

20
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,190
holding everyone in the stadium hostage.

21
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,190
A bag with the cash that is demanded

22
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,790
is placed in the specified spot,

23
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,090
and the officers charge at once to nab the criminal.

24
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:48,890
"Indiscriminate Murder Threat at the Stadium (Part 2)"

25
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,290
He's come, Inspector!

26
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,490
He's a man wearing sunglasses, dressed in a gray coat

27
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,090
and wearing a white mask.

28
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,690
The man just picked up the bag.

29
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,990
Is there anyone else around?

30
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,290
-No, he's alone. -Okay.

31
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,090
Nab him!

32
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,290
The gun! Look for the gun!

33
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,990
It's nowhere!

34
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,890
Talk! Where is it? Where's the gun?

35
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,490
Don't touch!

36
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,590
Don't touch my partner!

37
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,790
I'll shoot at the audience!

38
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,790
Get away from him!

39
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,390
Partner?

40
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,690
So the police were snooping around, after all.

41
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,790
Hey, what's this all about?

42
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,190
Mr. Kaneko of Nichiuri TV.

43
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,390
Well, that's...

44
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,590
Taking me lightly, huh?

45
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,990
I guess one person will have to die to set an example!

46
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,290
Hey, wait!

47
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,690
We're in a fix.

48
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,590
Well, I wonder who I should kill?

49
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,290
I've gotta whole load of targets to choose from.

50
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,690
Don't do that!

51
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,590
We'll do as you demand, so...

52
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,090
We'll pull out too!

53
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,290
We don't want any victims.

54
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,290
All right.

55
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,090
I'll give you a chance to make up for what you did.

56
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,590
-Make up? -Yeah.

57
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,690
I'm going to have Nichiuru TV who went out

58
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,490
and called the police give us additional ransom.

59
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,290
It'll be 10 billion yen.

60
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,190
Get 10 billion yen before the game ends

61
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,990
and place it at the same exit of gate 18.

62
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,590
If it's not ready by that time,

63
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,090
I'm killing somebody in the audience.

64
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,890
10 billion?

65
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,390
That's outrageous.

66
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,690
What's this? Are you saying that you can't pay my share?

67
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,090
My share?

68
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,590
So, there's only one more of them left?

69
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,190
Hey, is there anyone among the eight

70
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,690
that we marked a while ago using the phone?

71
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:06,090
No, Inspector. Everyone here is absorbed in the game.

72
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,990
Likewise. There seems to be no such person here either.

73
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,090
There is no one who seems to be on the phone here either, Inspector.

74
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,590
It can't be!

75
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,390
Where on earth is he calling from?

76
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,990
No use, no use.

77
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,290
No matter how much you strain your eyes,

78
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,490
you officers would never be able to see me.

79
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,990
-What? -Right.

80
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,890
And will you order the officers who are scattered among the audience

81
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,990
to leave right this minute?

82
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,890
I'm sure you're aware

83
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:36,590
that I'm holding 56,000 people hostage.

84
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,790
You know what will happen if you go against me.

85
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,090
Okay. I'll order all of the officers to leave right away.

86
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:54,490
Come off it. I can see right through you.

87
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,390
The man who is smoking a cigarette

88
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,390
sitting to the left side of the aisle on the very top stairs.

89
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,090
The woman who is hiding her face with a newspaper

90
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,490
sitting in the second row from the bottom,

91
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,990
in the center of the stand right up ahead.

92
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,390
The two men leaning against the railing of the front row,

93
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,290
diagonally in front of her...

94
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,490
They're all officers, aren't they?

95
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,190
I'll tell you about some more.

96
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,190
The fat man beside the goal

97
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,190
to the right of the bleachers right up front.

98
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,590
Hey, Genta, Mitsuhiko, Ayumi.

99
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,090
You guys are by the back stand, aren't you?

100
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,390
Yeah.

101
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,490
Don't you see someone looking through binoculars or something?

102
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,590
There are many.

103
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,290
They seem to be looking at the faces of the players

104
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,990
who are leaving the field during half time.

105
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,790
Idiot! He's looking towards the stands,

106
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,190
not the field!

107
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,890
Furthermore, he's using a phone too.

108
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,390
Among the 56,000 people here,

109
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:49,190
there could only be one person doing both.

110
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,490
I found him!

111
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,090
There's a weird guy looking around the stadium!

112
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,190
Where is that guy, Ayumi?

113
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,990
In the center of the back stand on the very top stairs.

114
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,790
But it looks like he's listening to music,

115
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,290
not talking on the phone.

116
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,790
-Music? -Yes.

117
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,390
Because he is wearing an earphone.

118
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,390
Something strange is attached in the middle of the cord.

119
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,790
What a funny looking earphone.

120
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,190
I see.

121
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,890
He had an earphone microphone attached to his cellular.

122
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,790
That's why the officers overlooked him.

123
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,690
Ayumi! I'll be right over,

124
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,690
so don't you dare take your eyes off him.

125
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,590
-He's the one! -What?

126
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,490
-Ayumi! -Ayumi!

127
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,990
Genta, Mitsuhiko.

128
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,090
Ayumi, which one is the criminal?

129
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,690
He's the one!

130
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,190
The hat, the coat...

131
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,090
He sure does look suspicious.

132
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,590
Yeah, he sure looks like a criminal.

133
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,290
You're under arrest!

134
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,990
-Hey, you guys! -You're not getting away!

135
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,690
Let go of me!

136
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,890
-What are you doing? -You won't get away!

137
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,590
Both of you, get off of him!

138
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,790
I'll out him to sleep right now.

139
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:07,090
Officer Takagi?

140
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,490
Gosh. If you're an officer, dress like an officer, will you?

141
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,990
That's right!

142
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,490
I can't help it, because my wireless broke on me.

143
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,190
What? Your wireless broke?

144
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,690
Yeah. Only mine wasn't doing too good.

145
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,190
Thinking that using a cellular phone might confuse everybody,

146
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,290
I was keeping contact with the Inspector

147
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,590
with an earphone microphone.

148
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,190
And where's the partner of the criminal?

149
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,590
He seems to have left the stadium from the main gate

150
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,990
with the cash because...

151
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,390
The criminal threatened us saying,

152
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,090
"I'll kill someone from the audience if you go after him."

153
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,890
Is he the only one who left the stadium?

154
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,290
Yeah, he's the only one.

155
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,590
Nobody else left.

156
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:49,490
Which means that the bad guys are still here in this stadium?

157
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,790
We've still got a chance of capturing him.

158
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,690
But what a greedy criminal

159
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,690
to demand double the first amount.

160
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:03,190
No, I don't think he's after money this time.

161
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,490
Because it's impossible to get 10 billion yen ready in 45 minutes.

162
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,190
Then, why?

163
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,090
The criminal is planning to shoot somebody to begin with.

164
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,390
What?

165
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,290
He'll do so at the time the end of the game whistle is blown.

166
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:29,190
Officer Takagi, how far has the game be played already?

167
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,490
It's exactly 15 minutes

168
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,790
after the 2nd half of the game has started.

169
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,290
Which means there is only 30 minutes to go

170
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,390
till the end of the game.

171
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,990
Put 10 billion yen in the bag

172
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,390
and place it at the same exit of gate 18.

173
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,690
If it's not ready by that time,

174
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,690
I'm killing somebody in the audience.

175
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,190
I'm sure you're aware

176
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,590
that I'm holding 56,000 people hostage.

177
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,390
Gosh.

178
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,190
Inspector!

179
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,590
Inspector Megure.

180
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,990
We've lost track of the car

181
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,290
of the criminal who fled with the cash.

182
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,190
-What? -I'm sorry.

183
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,090
We were threatened not to pursue the car,

184
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,790
so we're trying to be inconspicuous.

185
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,690
We got the license plate number, though.

186
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,490
But it turned out to be a stolen car.

187
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,590
We've got no choice

188
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:22,790
but to nab the one who is still within this stadium, then.

189
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,690
One? You mean there are two blackmailers?

190
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,190
The criminal said things like

191
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,690
"my partner" and "my share" in his conversation.

192
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,190
Which means that it is highly probable

193
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,190
that there are only two of them.

194
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,490
Furthermore, he remarked on the position

195
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,090
of all the officers throughout the stadium.

196
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:47,390
I'm sure that he is still hiding somewhere in this stadium.

197
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,890
But, how should we find him?

198
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,490
After all, the officers have all withdrawn

199
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,890
from the stands by demand of the criminal.

200
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,090
That's what I'm trying to figure out now!

201
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,590
Why don't you check through the video?

202
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,390
When you got the phone call,

203
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,990
a video that was not in use was scanning the audience, right?

204
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,390
If so, a shot of the criminal may be on the video.

205
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:11,290
A strange man looking through the stadium with binoculars

206
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,890
while talking on the phone.

207
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,590
I see.

208
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,790
Can we see that video right away?

209
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,090
Yes.

210
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,690
Inspector.

211
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,790
There seems to be no such suspicious person

212
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,290
in the stands up front or the back stand.

213
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,090
It can't be!

214
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,890
Did you check the press that came into the stadium?

215
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,990
If the cameras are equipped with zoom lenses,

216
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,490
they can see quite a distance.

217
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,890
I was watching over the stands where the camera men were,

218
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,090
but there were no suspicious looking persons.

219
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,190
Besides, if there was somebody on the phone looking through

220
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,590
the view finder of a camera and talking on the phone as well,

221
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,590
he would attract attention.

222
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,390
Right.

223
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,890
Ridiculous!

224
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,690
Then how on earth did the criminal talk on the phone

225
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,790
as well as look around the stadium at the same time?

226
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,790
How could he do it without anyone noticing him?

227
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,280
Inspector.

228
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,180
I got together a little over a billion yen for now.

229
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,780
It's impossible to get together an amount cash down like 10 billion.

230
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,380
We've got no choice.

231
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,080
We'll just use newspaper or something to fill up whatever is missing

232
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,880
and wait to see what the criminal will do.

233
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,380
Inspector.

234
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,180
What is it, Officer Takagi?

235
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,280
Maybe the criminal is not after money this time.

236
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,280
What?

237
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,380
It's obvious to anybody that no matter how you run around the banks,

238
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,080
it would be impossible to gather 10 billion yen

239
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,080
in a matter of 45 minutes.

240
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,680
Therefore, all the criminal wants is

241
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,780
the 50,000,000 yen that he first demanded.

242
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,380
Hey, don't tell me...

243
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,480
That the criminal was planning to shoot somebody

244
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,880
as soon as the game ended to begin with.

245
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,780
No way! Why?

246
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,780
Maybe something happened at Nichiuri TV recently

247
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,080
that someone held a grudge against?

248
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,080
No, I can't recall any such thing.

249
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,680
Hey, mister.

250
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,380
Was the voice of the criminal that called you

251
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,780
all of the same person?

252
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,180
Yeah. The voices of all three calls were muffled,

253
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,480
but I think they were of the same man.

254
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,180
Which means that the person who called

255
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,880
and the person who shot the ball are two different people,

256
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,580
so the man who came to get the money

257
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,080
is the one who shot the ball, right?

258
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,280
Yeah.

259
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,780
The other guy's voice was heard from the phone

260
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,080
that the guy who came to get the cash was holding, so...

261
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,380
But the guy who came to get the cash

262
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,380
didn't have a gun on him, did he?

263
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,480
I wonder why?

264
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,680
He gave his gun to his partner?

265
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,880
Okay, check all the videos between the 35 minutes,

266
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,180
10 minutes past the first half of the game when the ball was shot,

267
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,180
to loss time when he came to get the cash again.

268
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,680
Find the guy in the audience

269
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,380
that the man who came to get the cash had contact with.

270
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,280
He's the criminal that's left in the stadium!

271
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,380
Yes, sir!

272
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,380
Goal!

273
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,680
37 minutes past the 2nd half of the game,

274
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,680
Ramus's volley shot makes goal!

275
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,380
The score is a turn over of 2-1, with the Big's in the lead!

276
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,080
There he is, Inspector!

277
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,380
That guy is on the video!

278
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,280
Did he give something to someone?

279
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,580
No. He was just walking along the aisle.

280
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,680
Gosh. He's out of vision of the monitor.

281
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,480
Don't give up! We still have time.

282
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,780
As long as there's a possibility, keep searching!

283
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,680
It is very unlikely that he is on the video.

284
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,980
Moreover, it's not definite

285
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,780
whether he actually gave the gun to anyone.

286
00:14:54,780 --> 00:15:00,880
But this is the only way we have left to look for the criminal.

287
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,780
This is the only method we have left!

288
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,880
It's almost loss time.

289
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,880
Shut up! I know.

290
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,880
Gosh, there's not much time left!

291
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,280
Where is he? Where, where?

292
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,680
Where the heck is he?

293
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,080
Please...

294
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,680
Please, the time...

295
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,380
Please stop.

296
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,180
Cool it.

297
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,380
We can't control time, can we?

298
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,780
If we try to control it by force,

299
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,880
we'll have to pay the toll.

300
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,080
What're you talking about?

301
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,580
That was close!

302
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,080
It's already the 3rd time!

303
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,080
This is no time to be getting excited watching the game.

304
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,380
No, that's not it.

305
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,580
We were also looking for the suspicious person

306
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,780
that you were also looking for.

307
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,780
That suspicious man always disappears from scene!

308
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,280
Disappears?

309
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,280
See, the minute he is seen to the edge at left,

310
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,780
the camera moves and he goes off scene.

311
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,580
This is camera 13, isn't it?

312
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,380
How unlucky.

313
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,880
See?

314
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,780
Come to think of it, even a while ago...

315
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,680
I get it.

316
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,280
So, that's what it was.

317
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,680
Inspector, it's loss time.

318
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,980
It can't be helped.

319
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,280
Put a camouflage bag at gate 18, and watch it.

320
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,480
The rest of you, charge into the stands

321
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,780
as soon as the game ends! Hurry!

322
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,980
Yes, sir...

323
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,080
Huh? Where's Conan?

324
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,580
Go, Hide!

325
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,480
I've finally figured it out, mister.

326
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,180
You're the one who threatened Nichiuri TV, right?

327
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,380
It wouldn't look strange even if you were to be looking

328
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,080
through the audience with the camera.

329
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,580
And you wouldn't look suspicious

330
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,780
even if you were to be talking into the microphone

331
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,280
that is attached to your earphone.

332
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,180
Besides, nobody would imagine that

333
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,680
a camera man from the same TV station

334
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,480
is threatening his colleague.

335
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,480
Good work, kid.

336
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,380
I saw the video that you shot, mister.

337
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,680
The partner of the criminal entered the scene 3 times,

338
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,980
but all three times, he framed out right away.

339
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,980
And that's when I figured it out.

340
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,280
That it wasn't that he was coincidentally not in the video,

341
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,380
but that his partner had deliberately set it up to be so,

342
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,380
in order to protect him.

343
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,580
And the position of the officers that the criminal had pointed out

344
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,080
were all in the center stand.

345
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,180
The only camera that can take those shots

346
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:30,580
is the one that is situated by the back stand.

347
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:35,880
You're the only one who meets all the requirements to do so.

348
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,080
What are you going to do?

349
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,180
Will you turn yourself in?

350
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,280
Mister?

351
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,180
Yeah, I have no choice.

352
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,780
I'll do that.

353
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,680
Shoots!

354
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,980
What I'd actually like to say, but I can't do that.

355
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,780
I've got my reasons, you see.

356
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,080
Beretta.

357
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,780
That's not a Tocaref.

358
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,780
Yeah, my partner's gun

359
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,080
is in one of the trash cans inside the stadium.

360
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,280
The Baretta and Tocaref are all guns we got together

361
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,380
for the bank robbery a year ago.

362
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,280
The plan that we schemed and invested all the money

363
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,680
that we saved up for 3 years for, was perfect.

364
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,880
On the day we were to carry out the robbery,

365
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,980
a stupid event of some show biz talent

366
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,480
serving as one day branch manager was being held.

367
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,180
And it got crowded.

368
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:36,880
My woman who was expecting that money,

369
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,680
drowned herself in alcohol and committed suicide.

370
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:44,780
Thanks to the stupid event that Nichiuri TV had put on.

371
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,480
I see.

372
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,480
So, you became a camera man for Nichiuri TV

373
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,780
so that you could take revenge.

374
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,980
But, what do you plan to do?

375
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,980
If you shoot me now,

376
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,880
I'm sure someone will notice, right?

377
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,980
Nobody will realize a thing.

378
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,380
Look, the eyes of the audience are glued to the game.

379
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,180
With the cheer of the crowd and this silencer attached gun,

380
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,180
not a sound will be heard.

381
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,280
Nobody has even noticed that

382
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,080
you're down here in the field, either.

383
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,480
I'm shooting you the instant the game ends.

384
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,480
The cheers will turn into screams and there will be panic.

385
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,580
I'm going to flee in the midst of the commotion

386
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,980
and inform the papers that

387
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:37,980
"I killed a kid because Nichiuri TV refused to pay ransom!"

388
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,180
What the...

389
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,480
The game is over! The score is 2-1!

390
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,880
Big Osaka has won the Emperor's Cup game!

391
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,480
The man of the match, of course is Ramus Rivero

392
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,680
who showed great offensive as well as defensive play!

393
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,480
The defensive iron wall play that he displayed

394
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,480
towards the end of the game was fantastic!

395
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,880
Ramus!

396
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
Nice clear!

397
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,280
The criminal was arrested by the officers

398
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,480
who charged in at the end of the game.

399
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,880
30 minutes later,

400
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,180
his partner who was found at his apartment was also arrested.

401
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,380
The Emperor's Cup Game

402
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,780
ended as if nothing had happened at all.

403
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,280
Shoots. I wanted to have a closer look at the game.

404
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,880
The criminal was arrested

405
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,080
before we realized what was happening.

406
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,580
The Youth Detective Squad

407
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,680
didn't do anything worth noticing today.

408
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,080
Not really. The Inspector was saying that

409
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,980
you helped out in the arrest of the criminal too.

410
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,880
Really?

411
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,980
You're really something, Shinichi,

412
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:40,680
to be able to track down the criminal with so little of a clue.

413
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,980
You're becoming an even more attractive research material for me.

414
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,880
I don't need know 84 years old granny telling me that.

415
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,880
Oh, I'm actually...

416
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,580
18 years old, a perfect match for you.

417
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,780
What?

418
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,480
Maybe.

419
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,280
Next Conan's Hint:

420
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,300
"Handle name"

421
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,800
We'll be challenging a crime thought to be impossible in the next episode.
