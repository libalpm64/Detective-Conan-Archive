1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,020
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,120
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,920
A nice spot for the trolley and fishing.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,820
Pierce through an unthinkable case and disclose the truth.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,220
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,120
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,120
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,638 --> 00:01:59,238
Invited by Sonoko,

9
00:01:59,238 --> 00:02:03,538
we all come to a bass fishing contest held at Lake Okutani.

10
00:02:03,538 --> 00:02:05,438
There, we meet the candidates for championship

11
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:07,438
Ms. Saori Ayukawa

12
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:08,938
and Mr. Takuya Masubuchi

13
00:02:08,938 --> 00:02:14,038
as well as freelance writer, Mr. Toshihiko Funaki.

14
00:02:14,038 --> 00:02:15,838
The competition for the first day ends.

15
00:02:15,838 --> 00:02:18,438
It's a bit of a concern that

16
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:21,538
that night, Mr. Funaki and Mr. Masubuchi get into an argument,

17
00:02:22,938 --> 00:02:24,538
and sure enough, the following day,

18
00:02:24,538 --> 00:02:27,138
very near the place we were fishing,

19
00:02:27,138 --> 00:02:31,038
Mr. Funaki is found dead from a strong impact to his head.

20
00:02:33,838 --> 00:02:36,738
I wonder if that place is cursed.

21
00:02:36,738 --> 00:02:38,238
Cursed?

22
00:02:38,238 --> 00:02:40,738
Mr. Mizui, what do you mean?

23
00:02:40,738 --> 00:02:44,938
The thing is somebody died there 6 months ago too.

24
00:02:44,938 --> 00:02:46,838
Who is the person that died?

25
00:02:46,838 --> 00:02:48,738
A person called Mr. Kanie,

26
00:02:48,738 --> 00:02:52,238
who was also good friends with Ms. Ayukawa and Mr. Masubuchi.

27
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:55,138
A person died there a half a year ago.

28
00:02:55,138 --> 00:02:57,238
This is no coincidence.

29
00:02:57,238 --> 00:03:01,538
The murderer is probably one of the two!

30
00:03:05,438 --> 00:03:11,338
"Fishing Tournament Tragedy (Part 2)"

31
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:14,338
Okay, let's start with you, Mr. Masubuchi.

32
00:03:14,338 --> 00:03:20,438
Please tell me where you were between 10:00 to 10:30.

33
00:03:20,438 --> 00:03:23,138
Between 10:00 to 10:30...

34
00:03:23,138 --> 00:03:25,438
I was under the steel bridge at that time.

35
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,638
The steel bridge? On which side of the steel bridge?

36
00:03:28,638 --> 00:03:30,038
On the side where the road is!

37
00:03:30,038 --> 00:03:32,038
What, the side where the road is?

38
00:03:32,038 --> 00:03:34,838
Yes, that's right!

39
00:03:34,838 --> 00:03:36,938
The steel bridge is where Mr. Funaki was killed!

40
00:03:36,938 --> 00:03:41,538
He was found in a grassy area about 100m upstream.

41
00:03:41,538 --> 00:03:42,938
It seems so.

42
00:03:42,938 --> 00:03:46,238
I was surprised at the great number of police there.

43
00:03:48,738 --> 00:03:51,038
I think that he would've had to walk behind you

44
00:03:51,038 --> 00:03:53,138
to get to that grassy area.

45
00:03:53,138 --> 00:03:56,338
Didn't you notice Mr. Funaki walk behind you?

46
00:03:56,338 --> 00:04:00,038
No, I didn't because I was absorbed in fishing.

47
00:04:00,038 --> 00:04:01,438
Is there anyone who can testify that

48
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:04,338
you didn't move from under the steel bridge?

49
00:04:04,338 --> 00:04:05,438
No.

50
00:04:06,138 --> 00:04:07,738
No alibi, eh?

51
00:04:07,738 --> 00:04:10,838
Mr. Masubuchi was near there?

52
00:04:10,838 --> 00:04:11,638
May I...

53
00:04:11,638 --> 00:04:12,638
What is it?

54
00:04:12,638 --> 00:04:14,638
May I go now?

55
00:04:14,638 --> 00:04:19,438
Oh, yeah. I may ask you some questions again later.

56
00:04:23,238 --> 00:04:24,538
Sonoko.

57
00:04:27,238 --> 00:04:29,138
Nobody heard any scream.

58
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:31,238
The rock where he hit his head can't be found.

59
00:04:32,638 --> 00:04:35,438
Conan, are you going to quit fishing already?

60
00:04:35,438 --> 00:04:37,138
I don't feel up to it anymore.

61
00:04:37,138 --> 00:04:40,538
But, if you guys want to, go ahead.

62
00:04:40,538 --> 00:04:44,538
Yes. Yeah. Okay.

63
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:46,738
Inspector, we checked the alibis of everyone,

64
00:04:46,738 --> 00:04:50,638
from those who brought their own boats to those who rented boats,

65
00:04:50,638 --> 00:04:54,138
but nobody seems to have gone near the place the corpse was found!

66
00:04:54,138 --> 00:04:55,938
So, the boat wasn't used.

67
00:04:55,938 --> 00:04:59,438
Which means it's somebody that was alone

68
00:04:59,438 --> 00:05:02,838
on the left shore of the lake.

69
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:07,238
Inspector,

70
00:05:07,238 --> 00:05:09,938
I went to the inn that the victim stayed over at last night,

71
00:05:09,938 --> 00:05:12,338
and I was bothered by something that one of the guests said.

72
00:05:12,338 --> 00:05:14,138
Bothered?

73
00:05:14,138 --> 00:05:17,438
Yes, he says that the victim and Masubuchi

74
00:05:17,438 --> 00:05:19,538
were arguing in the bath room.

75
00:05:19,538 --> 00:05:20,638
I see!

76
00:05:20,638 --> 00:05:22,138
Okay!

77
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:32,238
Well, you seemed to have some sort of conflict with Mr. Funaki.

78
00:05:32,238 --> 00:05:34,438
Hey, kids, it's not for you to listen!

79
00:05:34,438 --> 00:05:36,738
We're fishing.

80
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:39,238
Yes, we figured if the candidate for champion Mr. Masubuchi

81
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,438
picked this place to fish,

82
00:05:40,438 --> 00:05:43,038
we may be able to get a large catch here too.

83
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,138
Yeah, something as big as a whale.

84
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,738
If we fish something that large, we won't be able to take it home

85
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:50,038
You guys...

86
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:51,538
If we get to fish something like that,

87
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:53,538
we'll be able to boast about it in school.

88
00:05:53,538 --> 00:05:55,138
We can boast about it!

89
00:05:55,138 --> 00:05:58,638
All talk, you kids, I tell you.

90
00:05:58,638 --> 00:06:01,138
So, how about it, Mr. Masubuchi?

91
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:05,338
Silence could work against you,

92
00:06:05,338 --> 00:06:10,038
because a lot of people have seen you and Mr. Funaki arguing.

93
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:11,438
Mr. Funaki...

94
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,038
Mr. Funaki?

95
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:15,738
Mr. Funaki said something ridiculous,

96
00:06:15,738 --> 00:06:18,138
that's why I couldn't help shouting at him.

97
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:19,638
Something ridiculous?

98
00:06:20,638 --> 00:06:21,638
Well...

99
00:06:21,638 --> 00:06:23,138
What is it?

100
00:06:23,138 --> 00:06:26,538
He insisted that I liked Ms. Ayukawa

101
00:06:26,538 --> 00:06:31,138
and that he'd play go-between for us.

102
00:06:31,138 --> 00:06:32,938
That's why I sort of blew my top!

103
00:06:32,938 --> 00:06:35,238
Oh, is that all?

104
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:37,438
Yes, Mr. Funaki said that

105
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:41,638
Ms. Ayukawa would never refuse any offer from him.

106
00:06:41,638 --> 00:06:46,238
Ms. Ayukawa would never refuse any offer from Mr. Funaki?

107
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:47,438
Come to think of it, even last night,

108
00:06:47,438 --> 00:06:50,338
she followed Mr. Funaki despite looking very unwilling.

109
00:06:55,538 --> 00:06:58,338
A person also died here 6 months ago.

110
00:06:58,338 --> 00:07:01,338
Conan, what are we going to do in a place like this?

111
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,438
The police already came here and searched,

112
00:07:04,438 --> 00:07:07,038
so I'm sure we won't find anything here either.

113
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:08,938
Let's go back.

114
00:07:08,938 --> 00:07:10,638
Mitsuhiko's right.

115
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,738
The murder weapon wasn't here.

116
00:07:12,738 --> 00:07:15,938
Moreover, we didn't even hear Mr. Funaki scream.

117
00:07:35,138 --> 00:07:37,138
Trolley train?

118
00:07:39,738 --> 00:07:41,338
The smell of kerosene.

119
00:07:41,338 --> 00:07:43,038
The stain on the vest.

120
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:44,238
I get it!

121
00:07:44,238 --> 00:07:46,338
Genta! Mitsuhiko! Let's trace these tracks!

122
00:07:46,338 --> 00:07:47,738
What?

123
00:07:47,738 --> 00:07:51,038
Mr. Funaki wasn't killed here!

124
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:56,138
The place where Mr. Funaki was killed is somewhere along the tracks!

125
00:07:56,138 --> 00:07:57,438
Let's go!

126
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:03,438
How far are we going to go? There's nothing.

127
00:08:03,438 --> 00:08:06,238
We're going to reach Okutani Station soon.

128
00:08:06,238 --> 00:08:08,038
I'm sure we'll find something.

129
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:10,238
I'm starving.

130
00:08:19,738 --> 00:08:22,038
Isn't that Mr. Funaki's?

131
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:26,038
The actual murder site is here! But how?

132
00:08:31,838 --> 00:08:32,838
Excuse me,

133
00:08:32,838 --> 00:08:37,038
did anybody come on this bridge between 10:00 to 10:30?

134
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:38,238
No.

135
00:08:38,238 --> 00:08:40,238
What about a camera man?

136
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:43,638
Yeah, at about 9:50, he came from the direction of the dam,

137
00:08:43,638 --> 00:08:47,138
and went down the steps that you all just came up.

138
00:08:47,138 --> 00:08:49,738
Did anyone cross this bridge after that?

139
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:52,438
Not one person until the police cars came

140
00:08:52,438 --> 00:08:54,238
and this place got boisterous.

141
00:08:54,238 --> 00:08:55,438
Oh.

142
00:08:55,438 --> 00:08:56,538
Early in the morning,

143
00:08:56,538 --> 00:08:59,938
Ms. Ayukawa came and went down the steps, though.

144
00:08:59,938 --> 00:09:01,438
Ms. Ayukawa did?

145
00:09:01,438 --> 00:09:04,238
Yes, at about 7:30, I think it was.

146
00:09:04,238 --> 00:09:06,838
She came back after about 10 minutes though.

147
00:09:12,938 --> 00:09:15,838
So, Ms. Ayukawa did come after all.

148
00:09:15,838 --> 00:09:17,438
But how?

149
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:23,538
Conan, I just remembered, we gotta return the boat.

150
00:09:23,538 --> 00:09:25,338
Genta, you said that

151
00:09:25,338 --> 00:09:28,438
you saw Ms. Ayukawa go up opposite Kutanisuji,

152
00:09:28,438 --> 00:09:29,538
but which side of the lake was she on?

153
00:09:29,538 --> 00:09:31,338
Let's see.

154
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:36,638
She was on the left when viewed from the lake,

155
00:09:36,638 --> 00:09:38,938
so maybe this side?

156
00:09:38,938 --> 00:09:41,238
After climbing back up from this side,

157
00:09:41,238 --> 00:09:42,638
in order to throw a stone at Mr. Funaki

158
00:09:42,638 --> 00:09:45,638
from right under the bridge that is opposite the bridge,

159
00:09:45,638 --> 00:09:48,638
she would have to cross this bridge once.

160
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:52,338
But the guard says nobody crossed.

161
00:09:53,638 --> 00:09:56,238
But, if he was killed here,

162
00:09:56,238 --> 00:09:58,338
why was his body found where it was?

163
00:09:58,338 --> 00:10:00,838
How was it carried there?

164
00:10:00,838 --> 00:10:04,238
He fell into the lake and naturally drifted to the shore there,

165
00:10:04,238 --> 00:10:08,738
where he came to and climbed up. He then passed away.

166
00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:12,038
No, Mr. Funaki's body was not wet,

167
00:10:12,038 --> 00:10:14,238
and he wasn't using a boat.

168
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:19,138
It's unnatural that his body was where it was after all.

169
00:10:19,138 --> 00:10:21,438
But, I'm certain that he was killed here!

170
00:10:21,438 --> 00:10:22,938
Conan.

171
00:10:22,938 --> 00:10:24,538
We're going to be charge extension fee

172
00:10:24,538 --> 00:10:27,138
if we don't return the boat.

173
00:10:27,138 --> 00:10:29,238
What method was used?

174
00:10:29,238 --> 00:10:33,038
-Conan, the boat. -Yeah, I know.

175
00:10:33,638 --> 00:10:35,238
Are we going to ride it to the boat house?

176
00:10:35,238 --> 00:10:37,738
-I guess so. -All right.

177
00:10:42,638 --> 00:10:45,938
Genta, shall we throw this away?

178
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:46,938
What's that?

179
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,138
We picked it up.

180
00:10:49,138 --> 00:10:50,238
Where?

181
00:10:50,238 --> 00:10:53,538
Around the place where Kutanisuji merges with the main stream.

182
00:10:53,538 --> 00:10:56,138
Oh! That handkerchief!

183
00:10:56,138 --> 00:10:57,538
What's up?

184
00:10:57,538 --> 00:11:00,638
-That handkerchief is Ms. Ayukawa's. -What?

185
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:03,738
I see.

186
00:11:03,738 --> 00:11:05,538
I got it!

187
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:13,591
The winner for the contest

188
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:17,991
is Mr. Takuya Masubuchi with a total of 30500 grams!

189
00:11:19,491 --> 00:11:21,891
Ms. Sonoko Suzuki will present

190
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:24,391
the championship trophy on behalf of the chairman.

191
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:27,691
Please give her a big hand everyone.

192
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:28,891
Any comments?

193
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:31,791
I was lucky to have been able to fish at a good spot.

194
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,491
I'll prepare for the next tournament and do my best again.

195
00:11:34,491 --> 00:11:37,791
If you're the killer, I promise I'll find evidence to nail you.

196
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,491
The winner of 2nd place

197
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:45,091
is Ms. Saori Ayukawa with a total of 22680 grams.

198
00:11:47,391 --> 00:11:48,791
Anything to say?

199
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,991
I was hoping for two consecutive wins

200
00:11:50,991 --> 00:11:53,291
but unfortunately I've lost to Mr. Masubuchi.

201
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:58,191
I would like to take that big cup home with me next year.

202
00:11:58,191 --> 00:12:02,291
Let's give the two winners a big hand once again!

203
00:12:03,691 --> 00:12:05,891
We would like to conclude

204
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,691
the 17th Suzuki Cup Lake Okutani Tournament.

205
00:12:08,691 --> 00:12:10,991
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all so very much.

206
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:20,091
She's doing the same thing as the Sleeping Kogoro!

207
00:12:20,091 --> 00:12:24,191
-What? -Please wait, Ms. Ayukawa.

208
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,691
I still have something I'd like you to tell everyone.

209
00:12:27,691 --> 00:12:30,591
I'd like you to tell us why you killed Mr. Funaki.

210
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:35,391
What? You mean Ms. Ayukawa...

211
00:12:35,391 --> 00:12:38,491
I'd like to know why you did what you did at this tournament

212
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,091
where I'm serving on behalf of the chairman.

213
00:12:41,091 --> 00:12:44,591
Come on, please tell us!

214
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:46,391
Just what do you think you're saying?

215
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:51,091
She was in Kutanisuji on the opposite side of the lake back then.

216
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:53,091
That's not the point.

217
00:12:53,091 --> 00:12:57,491
Because Mr. Funaki was not killed where he was found.

218
00:12:57,491 --> 00:12:59,591
What? That can't be!

219
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:02,391
Conan, please show her the stuff.

220
00:13:02,391 --> 00:13:03,591
Okay!

221
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:09,091
We found this camera beside the rail tracks of Kutanisuji.

222
00:13:09,091 --> 00:13:11,191
This is Mr. Funaki's camera.

223
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:13,891
He took pictures for us yesterday so I remember!

224
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:15,391
What?

225
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,491
The camera of the victim was found in Kutanisuji.

226
00:13:18,491 --> 00:13:20,891
But, why was it in a place like that?

227
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:23,091
We found it under Kutani Bridge!

228
00:13:23,091 --> 00:13:25,291
And these are the pictures that were printed from the film

229
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,291
that was in the camera!

230
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,091
-Hey! -Oh, yes, sir.

231
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:39,191
There's a picture of a trolley there, right?

232
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:41,391
The place that picture was taken from.

233
00:13:41,391 --> 00:13:44,891
The place where the leg of Kutani Bridge touches the shore,

234
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:48,091
a very small flat area.

235
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:51,291
I asked a railroad buff and found that

236
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:55,691
the place is famous for getting the best shots of the trolley.

237
00:13:57,691 --> 00:14:01,091
Ms. Ayukawa, I hear that you were invited by Mr. Funaki

238
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,991
to have a drink with him last night.

239
00:14:03,991 --> 00:14:05,991
At that time, you gave him information of that place

240
00:14:05,991 --> 00:14:09,191
where he could take pictures of the trolley

241
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:11,291
for a railroad buff magazine.

242
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:17,191
But Mr. Funaki was found 3km away, opposite the steel bridge.

243
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:21,191
I just said that's not the point.

244
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:22,891
Inspector Yokomizo,

245
00:14:22,891 --> 00:14:25,991
didn't you notice the black stain that was on the vest

246
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:28,191
that Mr. Funaki was wearing?

247
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:33,991
Now that you mentioned it, the forensic officers reported so.

248
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:36,391
The substance seems to have been oil and soot.

249
00:14:36,391 --> 00:14:39,391
Yes, it's the exhaust of the diesel steam engine

250
00:14:39,391 --> 00:14:41,391
that pulls the trolley along.

251
00:14:41,391 --> 00:14:43,291
Exhaust?

252
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:47,091
Mr. Funaki moved from under Kutani Bridge to the place he was found

253
00:14:47,091 --> 00:14:49,991
on the roof of the trolley.

254
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,991
Carried on the roof?

255
00:14:55,091 --> 00:14:57,291
You threw a rock at Mr. Funaki

256
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:00,291
who was waiting for a chance to take a picture of the trolley.

257
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,091
The rock hit him on the head

258
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:05,891
and he fell on top the roof of the trolley from the impact of being hit.

259
00:15:05,891 --> 00:15:08,091
Then carried on the roof of the trolley,

260
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:10,891
he crosses the bridge, until the sharp curve

261
00:15:10,891 --> 00:15:12,191
where he is flung off the roof

262
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:15,091
and his body thrown to the place where it was found.

263
00:15:15,691 --> 00:15:18,691
Such a coincidence exists?

264
00:15:18,691 --> 00:15:20,191
It's no coincidence.

265
00:15:20,191 --> 00:15:23,991
There is a train that leaves Lake Okutani Station at 10:50.

266
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:26,891
Ms. Ayukawa calculated it so that

267
00:15:26,891 --> 00:15:30,191
Mr. Funaki would fall on the roof of that train and killed him.

268
00:15:31,591 --> 00:15:34,191
Then, she knew ahead of time

269
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:35,891
that the body would drop where it did too?

270
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:37,191
It's most likely.

271
00:15:37,191 --> 00:15:40,391
No way. No matter how much he was off his guard,

272
00:15:40,391 --> 00:15:44,791
that Funaki would never let Saori kill him that easily.

273
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,591
If she dropped something,

274
00:15:46,591 --> 00:15:48,891
be it a rock or something from on top the bridge,

275
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:50,991
the guard at the station at the foot of the bridge

276
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,191
would've seen it.

277
00:15:53,191 --> 00:15:55,891
I confirmed with the security guard,

278
00:15:55,891 --> 00:16:01,291
and he said that no one crossed the bridge between 10:00 to 10:30.

279
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,091
If so, Saori couldn't have committed the crime.

280
00:16:04,091 --> 00:16:06,691
It would look to be so for everybody.

281
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:12,591
But, this is a carefully planned murder committed by Saori.

282
00:16:12,591 --> 00:16:14,291
It can't be.

283
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,591
Because she told me that

284
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:18,791
she was in Kutanisuji, but opposite the tracks.

285
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,591
That's right, isn't it, Saori?

286
00:16:21,591 --> 00:16:22,591
Yes.

287
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:24,591
But at around 7:30 in the morning,

288
00:16:24,591 --> 00:16:27,091
the security guard told me that he saw

289
00:16:27,091 --> 00:16:30,691
Ms. Ayukawa go down the steps at the foot of that bridge.

290
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:33,291
Her going there at that time

291
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,291
has nothing to do with the murder, does it?

292
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,891
Conan.

293
00:16:36,891 --> 00:16:38,291
Yes!

294
00:16:40,591 --> 00:16:44,091
What's this? It's just a plain wooden board.

295
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:46,491
That is a board that Genta and Mitsuhiko

296
00:16:46,491 --> 00:16:49,091
who were on the boat picked up.

297
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,291
They found it where Kutanisuji merges with the main stream.

298
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:55,791
Ms. Ayukawa used that board.

299
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:56,891
How?

300
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,091
Ms. Ayukawa who went there at 7:30

301
00:17:00,091 --> 00:17:01,791
placed that board

302
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,291
right above the place that Mr. Funaki would be standing.

303
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,191
Half of it was suspended in air and balanced very precisely

304
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:09,391
so it wouldn't fall over.

305
00:17:09,391 --> 00:17:12,091
She then placed a rock on the board.

306
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:16,491
At 10:07,

307
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:19,691
Ms. Ayukawa appears at the pedestal opposite the bridge

308
00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:21,391
and threw a rock towards Mr. Funaki

309
00:17:21,391 --> 00:17:23,891
who was taking pictures of the trolley.

310
00:17:49,191 --> 00:17:50,491
That's just your imagination.

311
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:52,991
Do you have evidence to prove that it's a fact?

312
00:17:52,991 --> 00:17:56,791
Mr. Masubuchi, didn't you think it strange that

313
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,591
Ms. Ayukawa was going to Kutanisuji?

314
00:17:59,591 --> 00:18:03,391
I hear that Kutanisuji is not a good fishing spot.

315
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:07,791
Why did Ms. Aukawa who was aiming for championship go there?

316
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,891
Besides, the handkerchief that is attached to the tip of that line

317
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:12,591
is Ms. Ayukawa's.

318
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:16,191
You can find handkerchiefs like that anywhere.

319
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,291
Please check that handkerchief.

320
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:21,191
You should get luminol reaction from it.

321
00:18:21,191 --> 00:18:23,091
There are no blood stains on it!

322
00:18:23,091 --> 00:18:27,691
Ms. Ayukawa, when Ayumi hurt herself yesterday,

323
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:30,091
you used that handkerchief, didn't you?

324
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:32,691
A slight amount of Ayumi's blood should've rubbed off

325
00:18:32,691 --> 00:18:35,291
on the handkerchief back then.

326
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,791
Of course there is no blood stain anywhere on it now.

327
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,791
But, Ms. Ayukawa,

328
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,991
do you know that once a handkerchief is stained with blood,

329
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:44,891
no matter how clean you wash it,

330
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:47,691
there will be luminol reaction.

331
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:49,391
How long has it been

332
00:18:49,391 --> 00:18:53,291
since you washed Ayumi's wound for her with it?

333
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,991
Ms. Ayukawa! Why did you kill Mr. Funaki?

334
00:18:58,891 --> 00:19:04,091
He's been blackmailing me since 6 months ago.

335
00:19:04,091 --> 00:19:05,891
Saori.

336
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:08,991
6 months ago, a man called Mr. Kanie

337
00:19:08,991 --> 00:19:14,291
was found dead in the same place that Mr. Funaki was found.

338
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,391
Mr. Funaki was probably blackmailing you

339
00:19:16,391 --> 00:19:19,491
because of something to do with that incident, wasn't he?

340
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,391
I had no intention of killing Mr. Kanie.

341
00:19:22,391 --> 00:19:26,091
Which means you killed that guy called Kanie?

342
00:19:26,091 --> 00:19:29,991
We were walking along Kutanisuji.

343
00:19:29,991 --> 00:19:33,791
I have no intention of getting married for a while yet.

344
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,491
So, you like Masubuchi after all, don't you?

345
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:41,391
How about it? Please tell me straight!

346
00:19:43,091 --> 00:19:44,391
Saori.

347
00:19:50,091 --> 00:19:53,091
Mr. Funaki saw what happened.

348
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,691
And he blackmailed you.

349
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,591
Is that it?

350
00:20:02,091 --> 00:20:05,791
I'll keep it quiet to the police, but for doing that...

351
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,391
I'm in a pinch right now,

352
00:20:07,391 --> 00:20:10,191
could you lend me about 200 thousand yen?

353
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:18,991
This new model camera cost me close to 1 million yen so...

354
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:20,691
You know what I mean.

355
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:29,191
I paid him three times up to now, a total of 7 million yen.

356
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:31,591
Then about a half month ago.

357
00:20:31,591 --> 00:20:36,791
I hear you signed a contract as a Pacific Sports Advisor!

358
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,191
How much was the contract fee?

359
00:20:39,191 --> 00:20:41,291
It's none of your business.

360
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:45,791
Oh, well. Please give me 10 million yen.

361
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:49,491
You know what will happen if you refuse, don't you?

362
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:54,791
Since he told me then, that he wanted to take a picture of the trolley,

363
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,091
I figured if I showed him where it is,

364
00:20:57,091 --> 00:20:59,791
so he would surely take pictures under that bridge.

365
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,491
As long as the timing is right,

366
00:21:01,491 --> 00:21:03,691
the corpse would fall on the roof of the trolley

367
00:21:03,691 --> 00:21:06,991
and carried to the same place where Mr. Kanie's body was found.

368
00:21:06,991 --> 00:21:09,091
That's what you thought, is that right?

369
00:21:09,091 --> 00:21:10,991
I figured if things went on as is,

370
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:12,691
I would be blackmailed all my life by that guy.

371
00:21:12,691 --> 00:21:15,691
Then everything ahead of me went black.

372
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:20,991
I'm really sorry that I spoiled your important tournament.

373
00:21:20,991 --> 00:21:22,091
More than for me,

374
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:25,991
I think this contest was more important for you, right?

375
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,391
I'm sorry, Father.

376
00:21:37,991 --> 00:21:41,391
Ms. Ayukawa, I'd like to hear about everything in more detail

377
00:21:41,391 --> 00:21:43,691
so please come with us to the station.

378
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:44,891
Yes, sir.

379
00:21:47,491 --> 00:21:48,691
Saori.

380
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:53,891
I'll wait for you no matter how long it takes.

381
00:21:53,891 --> 00:21:55,191
Saori.

382
00:23:22,891 --> 00:23:26,291
Didn't you think it was fantastic?

383
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,991
Sonoko's deduction.

384
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:29,591
You can say that again!

385
00:23:29,591 --> 00:23:33,391
Really, when did you check all those things out?

386
00:23:33,391 --> 00:23:35,691
Well, you see. I've got my ways.

387
00:23:35,691 --> 00:23:37,991
It's a cinch for me.

388
00:23:37,991 --> 00:23:40,891
I wonder if I did something so fantastic.

389
00:23:40,891 --> 00:23:43,891
What do you mean you got your ways?

390
00:23:43,891 --> 00:23:46,991
By the way, how'd you guys do?

391
00:23:46,991 --> 00:23:48,591
Did you at least catch one fish?

392
00:23:48,591 --> 00:23:51,091
Well, you see...

393
00:23:51,091 --> 00:23:55,991
Catching big fish is more difficult then solving a case!

394
00:23:55,991 --> 00:23:59,091
Next time I come, I swear I'll catch a big one.

395
00:24:31,818 --> 00:24:34,318
Next Conan's Hint:

396
00:24:34,318 --> 00:24:35,818
"Mole"

397
00:24:35,818 --> 00:24:37,218
The stage for the next episode will be Atami.

398
00:24:37,218 --> 00:24:38,318
-Hot spring. -Sweet cake.

399
00:24:38,318 --> 00:24:41,064
-Eel over rice. -No, that's not it.
