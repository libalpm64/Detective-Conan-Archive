1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:03,490
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,190
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,890
We'll get to the truth of the bomb threat case.

4
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,890
The love story of an officer at police headquarters.

5
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,490
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,590
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,990
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,470
When we went to see the victory parade of the Tokyo Spirits,

9
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,570
we, the members of the Youth Detective Squad,

10
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:06,070
ran into Officer Sato and the others of the police department in disguise.

11
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,270
Since a fax warning of

12
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,770
something bad will happen at the parade

13
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,270
was sent to police headquarters

14
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,170
so the officers were out investigating and checking the site.

15
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,570
Just then Officer Takagi's car...

16
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,170
What is this?

17
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,770
What happened?

18
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,470
Inspector Shiratori!

19
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,670
Where's Officer Takagi?

20
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,970
If he got caught in the explosion,

21
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,470
I doubt that he would make it.

22
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,270
Then, you mean that Officer Takagi...

23
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,770
Oh, no.

24
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,170
That's only if the worst happens.

25
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,570
What's that supposed to mean?

26
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,170
I made it to safety by a hair's breadth,

27
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,870
so please don't talk like I didn't make it!

28
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,070
When we were checking to see

29
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,370
if Mitsuhiko who was taking video near the scene

30
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,770
had taken any pictures of the bomber...

31
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,770
What?

32
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,770
Another bomb went off?

33
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,870
Yes.

34
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,470
This time it was at the phone booth in front of Haido Park.

35
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,970
From the type of bomb that was used,

36
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,870
it's most likely the same bomber.

37
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,170
Which means that the bomber is not after us, the police

38
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,670
but carried out an extremely heinous prank

39
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,770
against the Tokyo Spirits.

40
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,970
I wonder if it's really only a prank

41
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,770
of bad taste towards the Spirits.

42
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,370
And, besides, this tape that Mitsuhiko took.

43
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,670
Is something that will point out the bomber

44
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,170
really filmed on it?

45
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,270
If so,

46
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,670
what was filmed?

47
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:49,370
"Parade of Malice and Saints (Part 2)"

48
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,470
Look! Look at this...

49
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,770
Don't you think this lady is suspicious?

50
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,570
She's been glaring towards the camera right through!

51
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,870
That's right! She looks kind of bothered.

52
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,070
She just doesn't like the idea that Mitsuhiko

53
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,870
is filming her mini-skirt from a low angle!

54
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,370
But, no...

55
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,070
I didn't mean to do anything like that.

56
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,570
Then, what about this man with the beard?

57
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,270
He seems to be looking around the ground, doesn't he?

58
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,370
Look carefully at his hand!

59
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,470
He's holding a child's shoe, right?

60
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,570
So, he probably came to the parade

61
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,270
with his wife who was carrying their child

62
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,870
and both shoes just happened to come off.

63
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,470
So I'm pretty sure he's looking for them.

64
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,270
I see.

65
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,170
Hey! Officer Takagi!

66
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,570
You have to tell us some things that you've noticed too.

67
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,070
And I'd like to have a word with you later.

68
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,970
-Officer Takagi! -Officer Takagi!

69
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,470
Yes?

70
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,270
Are you really watching it carefully?

71
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,770
I watched it three times already.

72
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,470
But, no matter how many times I look at it, it's the same thing.

73
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,770
If you think that the crowd is suspicious,

74
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,870
everybody in the crowd looks suspicious

75
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,370
and if you think nothing is suspicious,

76
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,970
nothing looks suspicious.

77
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,170
It's virtually impossible to pick the bomber out of this crowd.

78
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,470
That's true.

79
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,670
Which means that the bomber would've thought the same thing.

80
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,570
But, the bomber stole the video camera

81
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,570
and attempted to remove the tape that was inside.

82
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,870
What did he did that for?

83
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,570
Maybe the culprit thought he was being filmed

84
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,270
although nothing was filmed?

85
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,670
Nothing was filmed?

86
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,070
Wait a second.

87
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,070
Nothing was filmed means...

88
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,870
Don't tell me that...

89
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,070
I see.

90
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,870
Conan.

91
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,570
Was something filmed?

92
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,070
No, nothing really.

93
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,170
Then, it's no good?

94
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,370
No, not really.

95
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,870
The bomber probably

96
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,470
want the tape not because something was filmed on it,

97
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,170
but rather because that person

98
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,470
was trying to hide evidence that nothing was filmed!

99
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,270
-What? -What?

100
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,270
Just what do you mean?

101
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,570
There's something I got to confirm first, though.

102
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,370
Hey, Conan. What is going on?

103
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,670
What do you mean hide evidence that nothing was filmed?

104
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,970
Since nothing was filmed on the tape I took,

105
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,970
the bomber didn't have to steal it, right?

106
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,470
Conan, wait!

107
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,570
Hey, Conan!

108
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,070
Just as I thought.

109
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,670
It's just as I thought!

110
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,670
What's with the mailbox?

111
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,070
You know what time Mitsuhiko climbed on top of the mailbox, don't you?

112
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,170
I don't remember details like that!

113
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,070
We can figure that out by watching the video tape

114
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,070
because the time is also filmed.

115
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,270
That's right!

116
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,770
It was the time I was filming

117
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,670
something far away by zooming so...

118
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:08,570
Here it is! It was 2:23 in the afternoon!

119
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:12,570
After that, we ran into Officer Sato

120
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,570
and until 14:38 when Mitsuhiko quit taking video,

121
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,370
we were by this mailbox, right?

122
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,470
So what?

123
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,870
Then, take a look at this!

124
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,270
Look at the time the mail is supposed to be picked up!

125
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,070
On holidays it says about 14:30.

126
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,570
That means they should be here

127
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,870
about 2:30 in the afternoon, right?

128
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,570
Yeah.

129
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,770
Which means,

130
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:42,970
we didn't see what we were supposed to see, didn't we?

131
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:43,970
Right!

132
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,870
The mailman's car!

133
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,170
They never came to pick the mails.

134
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:53,770
But the road was blocked by the parade

135
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,270
so maybe it couldn't come through?

136
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,470
No.

137
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,470
They usually choose a parade course

138
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,270
that does not interfere with duties of that sort.

139
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,970
Besides, only one lane is being used for the parade

140
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,470
that there is no way that the mail truck cannot make its way here.

141
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,170
But, if the roads are crowded,

142
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,070
it's easy to be late by about eight minutes.

143
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,970
No way.

144
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,570
It didn't look like there was a traffic jam,

145
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,070
and the collection time indicated on the mailbox

146
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,570
is in intervals of five minutes.

147
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,670
If there is a discrepancy of five minutes earlier or later,

148
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,770
the only thing I can think of is that something came up.

149
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:33,070
But the one who tried to steal Mitsuhiko's video camera

150
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,570
is the bomber, right?

151
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,270
Right.

152
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,870
What does the mail truck have anything to do with this?

153
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,270
And besides, would anyone want to steal

154
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,570
the videotape in the first place?

155
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,870
If it was left as is,

156
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,170
nobody would've noticed anything,

157
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,270
but now, it's like telling everybody

158
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,770
that something may be there!

159
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,870
Yeah.

160
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,070
I guess they didn't intend to steal it either.

161
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,470
If we were just a bunch of ordinary kids

162
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,670
who came to watch the parade.

163
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,570
I get it!

164
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,270
Yumi's mini-police car!

165
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,170
Since you were witnessed talking intimately with Yumi

166
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,170
in front of the mailbox,

167
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,770
the culprit tried to get rid of the evidence!

168
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,170
Yeah.

169
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,070
If a bombing incident takes part nearby,

170
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,870
it means that there is a possibility

171
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,170
the bomber would be filmed on the video,

172
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,870
and the police would without doubt check the film out.

173
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,770
Moreover, if we are acquainted with the police,

174
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,670
the time it would take to check the tape out

175
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,270
would be pretty speedy.

176
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,270
That's what the bomber was afraid of!

177
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,570
They probably noticed Mitsuhiko's video camera

178
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,970
only after they set the bomb up under Officer Takagi's car

179
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,470
that was parked right opposite the mailbox.

180
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,970
They couldn't go retrieve the paper bag under the car.

181
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,070
So they decided to get rid of the tape.

182
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,170
I don't understand, though.

183
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,970
The bomber faxed the police to let them know that

184
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,270
something was going to happen, right?

185
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,170
Yes.

186
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,270
If they call all the police officers over

187
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,570
and blow the car up,

188
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,270
it's obvious that the police

189
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:14,170
will come frantically after them.

190
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,370
Maybe they want to distract the police?

191
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,270
By pretending to be the same bomber three years ago?

192
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:25,670
Although I have no idea what kind of a case it was.

193
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,270
There's a high probability that

194
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,270
the bomber is after the lives of the police force,

195
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:34,370
just as was the case three years ago!

196
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,370
You just kind of resembled him.

197
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,970
The you just a while ago.

198
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:43,470
It seems that the one Officer Sato was trying to rescue was...

199
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,570
And I'd like to have a word with you later.

200
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,970
The question is, what the bomber is after.

201
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,070
Yeah.

202
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,770
It's very likely that the bomber is not after the police

203
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,970
nor playing pranks against the Spirits.

204
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,570
If my deduction is correct,

205
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,870
they are after...

206
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,770
But, since I'm still not sure,

207
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,270
I want you and Officer Takagi

208
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,170
to check something out for me.

209
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,170
Aye! You can count on us!

210
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,370
Officer Takagi, are you listening?

211
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,470
Yeah.

212
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,270
I'm listening...

213
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,970
This is Ayumi!

214
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,670
Conan, I've found the mailbox!

215
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,470
Okay, what's the location of the mailbox

216
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,970
and the collection time?

217
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:34,270
The mailbox is under the pedestrian overpass, two traffic signals away

218
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,970
from the first mailbox.

219
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,270
The collection time is...

220
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:41,170
About 14:35!

221
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,370
Okay!

222
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,670
Mitsuhiko here!

223
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,570
I've found one in front of the convenience store on Nichome!

224
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,170
The time is about 14:45!

225
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,070
This Genta!

226
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,370
I found one near the park on Sanchome.

227
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,070
The time is 14:55.

228
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,270
Hey, Genta.

229
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,170
Why are you whispering?

230
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,870
I can't help

231
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,770
because I went through somebody's yard, which was a short-cut.

232
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,170
I was mistaken for a thief after women's underwear,

233
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,970
and I'm hiding from the lady who came after me.

234
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,870
I see. Hang in there.

235
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,970
Now all we have to do is wait for Ai.

236
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,170
Yeah.

237
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,570
Oh, it's her!

238
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,770
This is the woman in black.

239
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,970
Hey!

240
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,070
The location of the mailbox is on the side of a bus stop

241
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,670
that is about 150m west from the mailbox on Sanchome.

242
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,570
The collection time is 16:25.

243
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,970
I just saw all of you now.

244
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,470
Can you see me?

245
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,470
Yeah!

246
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:45,370
Lastly, the pick up time for this mailbox is...

247
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,470
16:30.

248
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:54,570
So, if I match all the information with the map...

249
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:58,370
The course of the mail truck is like this.

250
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,370
Just like you said, Shinichi,

251
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,770
it seems to be getting farther and farther

252
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,170
from the course of the parade.

253
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:09,270
In addition, today is the Sunday before payday.

254
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:12,770
Now, all we have to do is wait for Officer Takagi to contact us.

255
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:15,170
If there were no traffic accidents

256
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,970
or road construction is this area today,

257
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,070
the reason the mail truck didn't come

258
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,670
to pick up the mail is...

259
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,640
Excuse me.

260
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,640
What's the matter, Mr. Tsutsumi?

261
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,640
If you're dropping off the mail that you collected,

262
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,140
go around the back and...

263
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,740
Well...

264
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,340
A large amount of very odd mail is mixed in the bag.

265
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,240
I want everyone to look at it now,

266
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,140
but could you open the front entrance please?

267
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,640
Okay. I understand.

268
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,340
I'll go open it right away.

269
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,740
Thank you so much for the trouble.

270
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,240
No problem.

271
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,440
So, what's this odd mail you're talking about?

272
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,340
Well that's...

273
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,540
Hey, just what do you think you're doing?

274
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,140
Sorry...

275
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,640
The stuff I wanna show is...

276
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,140
This, Mr. Mailman.

277
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,740
A gun?

278
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,740
Hey!

279
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,940
The guys back there come up front here with your hands in the air!

280
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,940
We're here to rob this place!

281
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,440
Hurry it up!

282
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,440
You too! Get with it!

283
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,940
Quit taking your time!

284
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,140
Okay, take it all out, the cash.

285
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,040
It's right before pay day

286
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,340
so I'll bet you're loaded!

287
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,840
I see.

288
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,540
So that's why you chose today,

289
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,540
that would overlap with the Tokyo Spirits parade.

290
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,940
Today, when the employees at the post office

291
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,540
would be reduced because it's a Sunday.

292
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,940
You sent faxes and used bombs to deceive the police

293
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,640
into thinking it had something to do with the bomb case three years ago,

294
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,840
and lured the police out.

295
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,440
Then, you make it look like a bad prank towards the Spirits

296
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,840
in order to divert the police attention.

297
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,040
After diverting the police attention,

298
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,840
you attacked the post office using the mail truck you hi-jacked.

299
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,740
Well, it's not such an intelligent idea though.

300
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,440
Hey, you over there!

301
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,340
Cut out your babbling!

302
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,140
Hurry it up and get up here!

303
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,640
So, he says.

304
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,540
Hurry all of you.

305
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,140
Come on, hurry.

306
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,440
Hey, what's going on?

307
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,040
Why...

308
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,240
Why are there so many of you, when it's a Sunday?

309
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,240
Oh, didn't you know?

310
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,940
Although we all belong to civil service,

311
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,540
we're not like the post office employees who have regular days off.

312
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,140
We're on duty 24 hours 365 days a year.

313
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,940
That's how it is for us, the police officers!

314
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,040
Police?

315
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,340
Inspector Megure!

316
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,440
We've taken custody of all the mailmen we found tied up

317
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,840
in the mail trucks!

318
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,040
Good!

319
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,040
You jerk.

320
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,640
Cut it out.

321
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,640
Because your way of thinking isn't wise.

322
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,640
Darn it.

323
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,540
So, the post office robbers were arrested.

324
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,940
The other robbers who set bombs at different places

325
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,640
and were waiting for the others to return

326
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,740
were all safely arrested.

327
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,740
And, that night...

328
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,140
But, it's a wonder you figured out

329
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,640
that the bomber's real target

330
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,440
was robbing the post office.

331
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,740
Well, not really...

332
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,940
The kids dropped the hint.

333
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,540
You mean Conan, right?

334
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,240
He's no ordinary kid after all!

335
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,940
Very true.

336
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,540
Oh, right.

337
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,540
I'm sorry about this afternoon,

338
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,840
for slapping you all of a sudden like that.

339
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,140
I'll bet it hurts.

340
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,540
Oh, no.

341
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,840
I'm to blame for not following orders.

342
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,940
Are you all right, Officer Sato?

343
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,540
The burn on the palm of your hands.

344
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,140
I'm fine. Though it still hurts a bit.

345
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,540
Although it still kind of stings

346
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,540
but I guess it will heal soon.

347
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,140
I guess so! I'm glad.

348
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,740
Excuse me...

349
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,840
Officer Sato?

350
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,540
What?

351
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,640
You mentioned earlier that you wanted to talk to me.

352
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,340
Oh, that.

353
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,140
Officer Sato.

354
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,040
Let's call off the date we were planning!

355
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
What?

356
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,040
I'm cursed.

357
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,340
Cursed?

358
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:11,640
Because all the people that I cherish vanish from before me.

359
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,540
My father,

360
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,140
my P.E. teacher in elementary school,

361
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,240
my senior in the baseball club and...

362
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,340
And, him too.

363
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,140
I don't want to go through anything like that ever again.

364
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,540
Officer Sato.

365
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,340
So, I'd rather we stay like we are now,

366
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,540
colleagues at the police station.

367
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,840
Officer Sato...

368
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,840
Officer Takagi?

369
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,640
That's the way to go! Go for it, Takagi!

370
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,440
Go! Go!

371
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,440
Go for it, Takagi!

372
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,340
You guys are sort of heavy.

373
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,140
Officer Sato. I...

374
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,340
Officer Takagi?

375
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,140
I will never...

376
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,240
Right.

377
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,640
You and me, we don't really work out to begin with.

378
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,840
Right...

379
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,640
I think someone cuter is way better for you!

380
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,840
You think so?

381
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,240
Yes...

382
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,540
You coward.

383
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,340
Bye for now then!

384
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,940
Officer Sato.

385
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,340
Officer Sato.

386
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,540
What's the matter, Officer Takagi?

387
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,640
You look kind of pale.

388
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,640
Are you eating right?

389
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,440
Let's hurry up and start questioning the people

390
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,240
about the post office robbery.

391
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,540
It seems he's still hasn't recovered

392
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,240
from the last time he was brushed off.

393
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,740
Come now, Ai.

394
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,540
Why do you know about it?

395
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,440
Hey, Takagi! How is it?

396
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,140
If you're not feeling up to it,

397
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,340
I can take over questioning for you!

398
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,540
Oh, no, well...

399
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,740
Hey! Takagi, your shoulder sure is stiff!

400
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,440
Takagi! Want some coffee?

401
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,240
If you're hungry, there are rice crackers, Takagi!

402
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,040
-Here... -Thank you.

403
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,540
Amazing! Officer Takagi's really popular, isn't he?

404
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,940
Well, it's not quite right...

405
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,700
Next Conan's Hint:

406
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,980
"Recycle"
