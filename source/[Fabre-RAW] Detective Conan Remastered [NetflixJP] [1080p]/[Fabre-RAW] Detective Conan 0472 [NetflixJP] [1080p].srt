1
00:00:01,378 --> 00:00:03,778
Adventure!

2
00:00:03,778 --> 00:00:05,778
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:05,778 --> 00:00:07,078
The library room at school ten years ago,

4
00:00:07,078 --> 00:00:08,578
it is filled with memories with Ran!

5
00:00:08,578 --> 00:00:10,178
A slightly dangerous code adventure!

6
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:11,478
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,078
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,078 --> 00:00:15,178
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:01,153 --> 00:02:04,153
"Library"

10
00:02:23,753 --> 00:02:24,953
"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Conan Doyle"

11
00:02:30,953 --> 00:02:33,853
Conan! Don't.

12
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,553
You're supposed to be quiet!

13
00:02:36,553 --> 00:02:38,253
Sorry.

14
00:02:38,253 --> 00:02:41,353
Besides, what bad manners yawning while you read.

15
00:02:41,353 --> 00:02:43,653
I'm sure that the "Conan Doyle" that you love so much

16
00:02:43,653 --> 00:02:46,853
is crying in his grave.

17
00:02:46,853 --> 00:02:48,453
I can't help it, can I?

18
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:49,753
I've read all the mysteries that are here

19
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:53,253
when I was in elementary school already.

20
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:55,553
There's nothing more that I haven't read.

21
00:02:55,553 --> 00:02:57,453
Really?

22
00:02:58,753 --> 00:03:03,253
This world is much deeper and mysterious.

23
00:03:03,253 --> 00:03:06,053
What was the voice I heard just now?

24
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,353
It feels like a distant memory.

25
00:03:08,353 --> 00:03:10,153
Right, it was back then...

26
00:03:10,153 --> 00:03:12,353
What with that scared look?

27
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:14,953
No, nothing.

28
00:03:14,953 --> 00:03:16,753
Hey!

29
00:03:16,753 --> 00:03:18,753
Kojima, just what do you think you're doing?

30
00:03:18,753 --> 00:03:21,153
Standing on books like that!

31
00:03:22,353 --> 00:03:25,053
But I can't reach the books on the higher shelf

32
00:03:25,053 --> 00:03:26,753
if I don't do this...

33
00:03:26,753 --> 00:03:28,753
Teacher, help!

34
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:32,953
Teacher!

35
00:03:32,953 --> 00:03:35,653
See, I told you so.

36
00:03:35,653 --> 00:03:38,053
Are you all right, Genta?

37
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:39,753
Which do you want to read?

38
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:41,653
I'll get it for you.

39
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:44,253
Ah, let's see...

40
00:03:44,253 --> 00:03:47,653
Before that, let's put those books back.

41
00:03:47,653 --> 00:03:50,053
Huh?

42
00:03:50,053 --> 00:03:53,253
It seems like something is stuck inside.

43
00:03:53,253 --> 00:03:55,353
I wonder what it is?

44
00:03:55,353 --> 00:03:58,253
Maybe it's a dead lizard or a snake!

45
00:03:58,253 --> 00:04:01,153
There are a lot of those things around nowadays, aren't there?

46
00:04:15,053 --> 00:04:20,853
"The Adventures of Young Shinichi Kudo (Part 1)"

47
00:04:21,953 --> 00:04:23,553
No.

48
00:04:23,553 --> 00:04:25,453
Come on! Don't scare me like that.

49
00:04:25,453 --> 00:04:28,253
I thought it was really a snake or something.

50
00:04:28,253 --> 00:04:30,353
This is a wallet, isn't it?

51
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:34,153
Yes, but it looks like leather and not snake skin.

52
00:04:34,153 --> 00:04:35,853
But, who could've put it here?

53
00:04:35,853 --> 00:04:37,753
And for what reason?

54
00:04:37,753 --> 00:04:41,953
Let's open it. Money could be inside!

55
00:04:41,953 --> 00:04:43,153
Goodness...

56
00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:50,853
There's only one piece of paper inside.

57
00:04:50,853 --> 00:04:52,253
What?

58
00:04:53,653 --> 00:04:55,853
There's something written on it.

59
00:04:55,853 --> 00:04:57,453
What does it say?

60
00:04:57,453 --> 00:04:58,853
"Thank you."

61
00:04:58,853 --> 00:05:01,053
"Ran Mouri of 1st grade class A."

62
00:05:02,453 --> 00:05:04,153
How do you know?

63
00:05:05,553 --> 00:05:07,053
Does it really say so?

64
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:08,253
Let's look.

65
00:05:08,253 --> 00:05:09,253
"Thank you, Ran Mouri of 1st grade class A."

66
00:05:09,253 --> 00:05:13,653
That's what's written...

67
00:05:13,653 --> 00:05:17,853
Of course. Because that's what Ran and I...

68
00:05:17,853 --> 00:05:23,453
I mean Ran told me that something like that happened in the past!

69
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:24,653
What kind of thing?

70
00:05:24,653 --> 00:05:27,753
Yeah, that she encountered a very queer

71
00:05:27,753 --> 00:05:30,153
and eerie incomprehensible situation!

72
00:05:31,253 --> 00:05:33,853
"Ten years ago" -It was just about ten years ago.

73
00:05:33,853 --> 00:05:35,653
Wait up, Shinichi!

74
00:05:35,653 --> 00:05:37,553
Let's not do it after all.

75
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:39,153
I mean it's so late.

76
00:05:39,153 --> 00:05:41,053
That's why I'm telling you to go home!

77
00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:43,953
If they find out you snuck out, you're going to get scolded!

78
00:05:43,953 --> 00:05:46,853
I'll figure out its identity alone.

79
00:05:46,853 --> 00:05:49,353
I don't want you to go alone

80
00:05:49,353 --> 00:05:52,153
and be eaten by the ghost.

81
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,653
Come off it!

82
00:05:55,653 --> 00:05:58,753
There's no such thing as ghosts in the world!

83
00:05:58,753 --> 00:06:01,353
But, Sonoko said she heard.

84
00:06:01,353 --> 00:06:03,953
That it appears in the library on nights when the moon is full!

85
00:06:03,953 --> 00:06:05,253
She says it groans in an eerie voice,

86
00:06:05,253 --> 00:06:08,353
this ghost wearing a strange hat...

87
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,653
And tonight there happens to be full moon out there.

88
00:06:11,653 --> 00:06:13,353
Very interesting.

89
00:06:15,953 --> 00:06:17,553
Shinichi!

90
00:06:21,853 --> 00:06:24,053
So, you're coming along after all.

91
00:06:24,053 --> 00:06:25,553
Because...

92
00:06:28,353 --> 00:06:31,553
No good after all, it's locked.

93
00:06:31,553 --> 00:06:32,953
Can do!

94
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:39,453
Why is it not locked?

95
00:06:41,553 --> 00:06:44,053
I left this window unlocked before leaving school today.

96
00:06:44,053 --> 00:06:46,953
That security guard's not all that careful either.

97
00:06:49,253 --> 00:06:51,453
Okay, let's go to the library then.

98
00:06:52,753 --> 00:06:54,053
Oh, wait!

99
00:07:15,953 --> 00:07:16,953
Ran!

100
00:07:21,053 --> 00:07:23,353
Somebody's in the library!

101
00:07:23,353 --> 00:07:24,553
Ghost?

102
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:35,253
It's just the security guard.

103
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:36,753
He scared me out of my wits.

104
00:07:37,853 --> 00:07:41,153
He looks wasted today too.

105
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:43,353
Okay, since he checked this place now,

106
00:07:43,353 --> 00:07:45,153
he won't be back here for some time.

107
00:08:12,053 --> 00:08:15,053
See, there's no ghost anywhere.

108
00:08:15,053 --> 00:08:17,553
But, there's a strange sound...

109
00:08:22,453 --> 00:08:26,553
A ghost wearing a hat is looking in from the window!

110
00:08:26,553 --> 00:08:27,953
Shinichi!

111
00:08:27,953 --> 00:08:30,553
Come off it! Take a good look!

112
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:34,753
The hook of the curtain came off and it just looks that way.

113
00:08:34,753 --> 00:08:36,853
It's said to appear on nights when the moon is full

114
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:38,453
because when it's brightly lit by the moon,

115
00:08:38,453 --> 00:08:41,353
the silhouette of this is clearly outlined.

116
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:43,153
And the thing that sounds like a laugh

117
00:08:43,153 --> 00:08:46,453
is the sound of the wind coming in from the space between the window.

118
00:08:46,453 --> 00:08:49,853
This is how it goes for most ghost stories once the trick is revealed...

119
00:08:49,853 --> 00:08:51,253
I guess so...

120
00:08:51,253 --> 00:08:52,453
Come on, let's go home!

121
00:08:52,453 --> 00:08:54,153
There's nothing here already.

122
00:08:55,853 --> 00:08:57,353
Do you really think so?

123
00:09:01,853 --> 00:09:03,153
Shinichi!

124
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:08,153
Could it be that you just read the outline of the beginning of the story

125
00:09:08,153 --> 00:09:11,453
and already think that you've figured everything out?

126
00:09:11,453 --> 00:09:12,453
"Arsene Lupin, Gentleman Burglar by Maurice LeBlanc"

127
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:15,053
This world is much deeper...

128
00:09:16,153 --> 00:09:18,653
and mysterious.

129
00:09:18,653 --> 00:09:20,253
What are you?

130
00:09:27,253 --> 00:09:29,053
Me?

131
00:09:29,053 --> 00:09:31,053
I'm your...

132
00:09:31,053 --> 00:09:33,153
Sibling.

133
00:09:33,153 --> 00:09:34,253
What?

134
00:09:34,253 --> 00:09:37,653
Rather, I should say, your younger brother,

135
00:09:37,653 --> 00:09:40,353
although we're quite some years apart.

136
00:09:41,953 --> 00:09:43,853
My younger brother?

137
00:09:43,853 --> 00:09:45,253
Cut out the stupid joke.

138
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:47,453
Ran, get the security guard, quick!

139
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:48,553
Okay!

140
00:09:52,053 --> 00:09:54,553
What? It won't open!

141
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:55,753
What?

142
00:09:55,753 --> 00:09:56,853
No use.

143
00:09:56,853 --> 00:10:00,253
I've cast a spell on that door.

144
00:10:00,253 --> 00:10:02,653
And it only listens to me.

145
00:10:02,653 --> 00:10:03,853
What'd you say?

146
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,753
Hold it, I didn't come here to have it out with you.

147
00:10:07,753 --> 00:10:11,153
I came to challenge you.

148
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:12,553
That's all.

149
00:10:14,653 --> 00:10:19,253
I'm wondering if you can find the treasure that is here.

150
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:20,953
Treasure?

151
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,353
If you find it, you win.

152
00:10:23,353 --> 00:10:26,253
I'll give you the treasure.

153
00:10:26,253 --> 00:10:27,453
On top of that,

154
00:10:27,453 --> 00:10:30,553
I'll disclose my identity to you.

155
00:10:30,553 --> 00:10:34,053
You're free to take on the challenge or not.

156
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:36,153
If you accept the challenge, I'll undo the spell

157
00:10:36,153 --> 00:10:37,853
and you can get out of here.

158
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:39,053
But, if you don't accept it,

159
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:41,353
you'll end up spending your entire life in this dark and cold room

160
00:10:41,353 --> 00:10:44,353
that sends chills up your spine.

161
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:45,453
And by the way,

162
00:10:45,453 --> 00:10:48,253
I happen to love blood.

163
00:10:48,253 --> 00:10:50,953
I just can't resist red things.

164
00:10:52,053 --> 00:10:53,953
You don't scare me at all!

165
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:57,853
We're not going to listen to a villain like you!

166
00:10:57,853 --> 00:11:00,353
What a spirited young lady.

167
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,253
I accept.

168
00:11:03,253 --> 00:11:05,453
I'm saying that I'm taking on the challenge!

169
00:11:05,453 --> 00:11:07,253
I'm playing his game!

170
00:11:07,253 --> 00:11:09,953
Just as would be expected of "Shinichi Kudo".

171
00:11:09,953 --> 00:11:11,753
My "older brother".

172
00:11:24,053 --> 00:11:25,553
Shinichi.

173
00:11:25,553 --> 00:11:27,153
Why you... What do you think you're doing...

174
00:11:29,153 --> 00:11:30,653
He's gone.

175
00:11:33,453 --> 00:11:34,953
He vanished?

176
00:11:53,691 --> 00:11:57,291
Hey, Shinichi are you really going to take on the challenge?

177
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,291
Yeah.

178
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,291
Because father tells me that I should never back out

179
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,891
when somebody picks a fight with me.

180
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:05,491
But, that man looked scary like the devil.

181
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:09,091
Be it a devil or an ogre,

182
00:12:09,091 --> 00:12:12,291
I want to find out what his identity is.

183
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,791
"Let's repress the anger of Haido."

184
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,191
As well as the answer to this code!

185
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:21,291
But if that man casts a strange spell on you again,

186
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,591
you might die, Shinichi.

187
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:24,791
Spell?

188
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,891
Remember, he cast a spell on the door

189
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:28,991
so that it wouldn't open, right?

190
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:31,491
Come off it! Take a good look.

191
00:12:31,491 --> 00:12:33,991
There's a mop placed over there.

192
00:12:33,991 --> 00:12:35,991
A fishing line is tied onto the handle

193
00:12:35,991 --> 00:12:38,791
and passed through a hook that is suspended in air.

194
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,291
Since the time we entered this room

195
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,791
that guy manipulated the fishing line from behind the bookshelf

196
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:47,891
and made the mop stop the door, so that it wouldn't open.

197
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:49,691
And as for the other door,

198
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:53,191
he probably locked it beforehand from the outside so it wouldn't open.

199
00:12:54,391 --> 00:12:57,691
Either way, in this dark place it's hard to tell right off the bat.

200
00:12:57,691 --> 00:13:00,991
Moreover, he said a lot of things to scare us

201
00:13:00,991 --> 00:13:03,191
but he's no wizard!

202
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:05,291
He's just a klutz of a magician

203
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,491
that forgot to hide the secret to his tricks!

204
00:13:07,491 --> 00:13:09,091
You're amazing, Shinichi!

205
00:13:09,091 --> 00:13:11,291
You sound just like Holmes!

206
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,991
I guess so.

207
00:13:14,691 --> 00:13:16,791
Then, Mr. Holmes?

208
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,591
What does that code say?

209
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,991
I don't know what it means but...

210
00:13:21,991 --> 00:13:23,391
I think it is read as,

211
00:13:23,391 --> 00:13:27,591
"Haido no okoriwo chinmeyo" (Means let's repress the anger of Haido).

212
00:13:27,591 --> 00:13:29,791
"Okoriwo chinmeyo"?

213
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,391
Is that really how you read it?

214
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:35,091
Yeah, the word "okoru" (kanji for anger) comes out a lot in novels.

215
00:13:35,091 --> 00:13:38,991
For the word, "chin", mom has a CD entitled "Chinkonka" (Kanji for Requiem)

216
00:13:38,991 --> 00:13:39,991
"Requiem" -I asked her how it's read before,

217
00:13:39,991 --> 00:13:41,391
so there's no mistake about it!

218
00:13:42,591 --> 00:13:45,691
Maybe a grown-up can tell us what it means!

219
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,591
Let's ask our dads!

220
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:48,891
No way!

221
00:13:48,891 --> 00:13:51,191
Don't ever ask any grown-up!

222
00:13:51,191 --> 00:13:53,791
This is a match between that guy and me!

223
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:05,791
That boy...

224
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,491
Read the phrase "Ikariwo shizumeyo" (Kanji for repress the anger),

225
00:14:07,491 --> 00:14:11,291
mistakenly and read, "Okoriwo chinmeyo"!

226
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,791
How cute.

227
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:16,191
I'll bet that boy called Shinichi was dumb!

228
00:14:16,191 --> 00:14:19,491
Give me a break. You can't read it either, can you?

229
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,091
You don't have to laugh that hard.

230
00:14:21,091 --> 00:14:22,391
Hey!

231
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:24,091
You can't help it.

232
00:14:24,091 --> 00:14:26,491
I mean he was only a first grader back then after all.

233
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:30,991
But, that boy called Shinichi, kind of resembles Conan.

234
00:14:30,991 --> 00:14:32,791
You think so?

235
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,191
And then?

236
00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:35,991
What happened after that?

237
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:37,691
Come on tell us, quick!

238
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:40,291
Did the two get home safely?

239
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:44,091
Yeah, according to Ran...

240
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,091
Ran!

241
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:48,791
Where on earth did you go at this time of night?

242
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:52,291
Well, I sort of forgot something at school so...

243
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,591
Don't lie to me!

244
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:56,091
It's Shinichi again, isn't it?

245
00:14:56,091 --> 00:14:57,991
Yes.

246
00:14:57,991 --> 00:14:59,191
Just as I thought!

247
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:01,891
I thought he was putting on a low profile recently but...

248
00:15:01,891 --> 00:15:04,791
I wonder how Yukiko is bringing him up?

249
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:09,591
A liberal upbringing as would be expected of her, I'd say.

250
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:12,391
Honey, are you going to work?

251
00:15:12,391 --> 00:15:15,991
Yeah. There was a murder at a warehouse at Haido Harbor just a while ago.

252
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:18,591
I got a call from Inspector Megure.

253
00:15:18,591 --> 00:15:20,691
Please do be careful!

254
00:15:20,691 --> 00:15:22,391
I mean it's so dangerous these days.

255
00:15:22,391 --> 00:15:25,291
Make sure you lock the doors too!

256
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:29,291
It seems that the flashy thief is out there having a ball too, so...

257
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,291
Of course!

258
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,291
I mean I'm the wife of a police officer after all!

259
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,791
Bye.

260
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,991
Bye. Take care of Ran, Eri.

261
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:38,991
Okay...

262
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:40,391
I got it!

263
00:15:40,391 --> 00:15:42,191
I'll give him a good lecture.

264
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,091
I'm so sorry, Eri.

265
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:45,391
Good night.

266
00:15:47,391 --> 00:15:51,691
So, you're not going to bed until you spit it out, Shinichi.

267
00:15:51,691 --> 00:15:55,791
Why did you take a girl with you to school at night?

268
00:15:56,891 --> 00:15:58,691
I told you already, didn't I?

269
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,491
I forgot something and went to get it.

270
00:16:00,491 --> 00:16:03,891
Do you think that suffices as an answer?

271
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:05,791
Well, no big deal!

272
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,391
They both came back safely.

273
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:10,791
But, Yusaku...

274
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,491
Besides, this is not an interrogation by the police,

275
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:16,791
so getting angry will only make him more reticent.

276
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:20,591
First, repress your anger and deal with him calmly.

277
00:16:20,591 --> 00:16:22,391
"Let's repress your anger"?

278
00:16:22,391 --> 00:16:24,791
How do you write that word?

279
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,291
"Let's repress the anger".

280
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,591
Do you write it like this?

281
00:16:28,891 --> 00:16:30,091
What's that?

282
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,391
Well, the teacher...

283
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,691
It's a secret code that the teacher made.

284
00:16:34,691 --> 00:16:36,491
What a teacher.

285
00:16:36,491 --> 00:16:38,891
Giving a code with difficult kanji characters like this to first graders.

286
00:16:38,891 --> 00:16:40,091
"Let's repress the anger of Haido."

287
00:16:40,091 --> 00:16:43,791
But, she seems to be an interesting teacher who likes riddles.

288
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,691
Riddles?

289
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:49,791
It's to simple to deem that "Haido" is someone's name.

290
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:50,791
Right!

291
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,691
Shall we go to the beach or something soon?

292
00:16:52,691 --> 00:16:54,191
How nice!

293
00:16:56,691 --> 00:16:58,091
Haido Harbor?

294
00:16:58,091 --> 00:17:02,191
Does that code say "Go to Haido Harbor", Shinichi?

295
00:17:02,191 --> 00:17:03,391
Yeah.

296
00:17:03,391 --> 00:17:06,391
"Let's repress the anger of Haido".

297
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:09,291
It means the place where the anchors of ships are sunk in Haido-cho,

298
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,091
in other words the harbor.

299
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:15,891
But, Shinichi, I thought last night you read it as "okoriwo chinmeyo"?

300
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:18,991
Did I?

301
00:17:18,991 --> 00:17:20,891
But are you sure it's okay?

302
00:17:20,891 --> 00:17:24,591
After all, that man snuck into school at night

303
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:27,091
and was waiting for you, wasn't he?

304
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:28,891
Don't you think we should notify the police?

305
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:30,091
He said that if I decipher this code,

306
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,991
he would disclose his identity.

307
00:17:32,991 --> 00:17:35,091
We can contact the police then.

308
00:17:35,091 --> 00:17:36,891
But I'm really sorry, Doc,

309
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:39,791
for making you come along with us so early in the morning.

310
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,391
No... Rather, I'm glad you did.

311
00:17:42,391 --> 00:17:45,891
It's been a long time since I've seen you both getting along so well.

312
00:17:46,991 --> 00:17:52,391
You two used to always play together up to elementary school,

313
00:17:52,391 --> 00:17:54,091
but since you guys haven't been around much together recently,

314
00:17:54,091 --> 00:17:55,891
I got worried

315
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:58,291
thinking that maybe you fought or something.

316
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,291
No, we didn't.

317
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,491
Right?

318
00:18:01,491 --> 00:18:03,391
Yeah.

319
00:18:05,391 --> 00:18:08,391
Look at all the police cars.

320
00:18:09,591 --> 00:18:11,291
I wonder if something happened?

321
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,891
Come to think of it, dad was saying last night

322
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:16,291
that there was a murder at Haido Harbor.

323
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,891
Don't tell me that the man is the killer?

324
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:20,791
No, it can't be.

325
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:26,591
The incident occurred about the same time you both snuck into school.

326
00:18:26,591 --> 00:18:30,891
And there was a news report saying that the killer was arrested at dawn.

327
00:18:30,891 --> 00:18:33,491
The question is why does the man that you saw last night

328
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:37,291
want you both to come here?

329
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,691
-If we wait here, maybe he'll come? -No.

330
00:18:40,691 --> 00:18:43,391
I just can't resist red things.

331
00:18:43,391 --> 00:18:45,191
Red, it's red.

332
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:46,591
Something that's red.

333
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:47,991
What about that?

334
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:50,491
The place where the light is on is red!

335
00:18:50,491 --> 00:18:52,591
Dr. Agasa already told us, didn't he?

336
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:55,891
The case has nothing to do with him.

337
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:59,391
He wouldn't have known that police cars would be here.

338
00:18:59,391 --> 00:19:01,991
Which means he was referring to something red

339
00:19:01,991 --> 00:19:03,191
that was here to begin with.

340
00:19:08,391 --> 00:19:10,191
"Fire hydrant" -The fire hydrant?

341
00:19:12,391 --> 00:19:14,991
But nobody seems to be here.

342
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:19,291
It's flipped over!

343
00:19:24,891 --> 00:19:25,891
A code is behind it.

344
00:19:25,891 --> 00:19:27,591
Another difficult Kanji character.

345
00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:28,791
Let's see...

346
00:19:30,191 --> 00:19:32,291
"Prove that Toriya is innocent."

347
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,691
"Surprise wise old man out of his wits."

348
00:19:37,491 --> 00:19:41,091
I can tell that "Toriya" means Toriya-cho,

349
00:19:41,091 --> 00:19:45,091
but prove the Toriya innocent is what I can't make out.

350
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:48,091
I'm sure it's some kind of riddle, though.

351
00:19:48,091 --> 00:19:51,691
Does wise old man mean Komon Mito?

352
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,891
Maybe.

353
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,591
Doc, if it says the guy's innocent,

354
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:56,791
it means that he's not the culprit, right?

355
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,291
Yeah.

356
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,991
If he's the culprit, he's black.

357
00:20:01,091 --> 00:20:02,791
My dad, often says,

358
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,291
"That guy's black, he's the culprit".

359
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,791
Black?

360
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,291
He's not the culprit. He's not black.

361
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,091
In other words, he's white.

362
00:20:11,091 --> 00:20:14,191
White...

363
00:20:14,191 --> 00:20:16,091
The Toriya Castle (Has the same sound as white)!

364
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:19,091
Let's head off immediately to the remains of the Toriya Castle then!

365
00:20:19,091 --> 00:20:22,491
No, We're going to the floodgate near that castle!

366
00:20:22,491 --> 00:20:23,491
The floodgate?

367
00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:25,391
Not the castle?

368
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,791
The wise old man,

369
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,591
just as Ran said is Komon Mito.

370
00:20:29,591 --> 00:20:30,791
"Liver" mean internal organ (Has the same sound as wits).

371
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,991
"Surprise wise old man out of his wits" most probably means

372
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:34,691
to take the center out.

373
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,891
"Komon Mito" -So, by removing the two kanji words in the middle,

374
00:20:35,891 --> 00:20:37,991
"to" and "kou", from Komon Mito.

375
00:20:37,991 --> 00:20:39,891
"Suimon" (Means floodgate in kanji)

376
00:20:39,891 --> 00:20:40,891
I see!

377
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:44,291
The kanji characters that remain are "Mizu" (water) and "Mon" (gate).

378
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,291
Since it's near Toriya Castle,

379
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,791
it has to be the Toriya Floodgates!

380
00:20:51,891 --> 00:20:55,391
So, here we are at Toriya Floodgate.

381
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:59,191
There's nothing red and suspicious here.

382
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:10,391
Maybe we should've gone to the remains of the castle first, after all?

383
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:14,591
If so, the phrase, "Prove that Toriya is innocent" would've sufficed.

384
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:17,891
But, the flood gate was written after that.

385
00:21:17,891 --> 00:21:19,091
Which means that here

386
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:21,691
or in between the floodgate and the castle somewhere,

387
00:21:21,691 --> 00:21:22,991
there's a red thing...

388
00:21:25,591 --> 00:21:26,791
The railroad crossing!

389
00:21:38,991 --> 00:21:40,291
Did you find anything?

390
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,691
No, nothing really.

391
00:21:42,691 --> 00:21:43,891
Wait a second.

392
00:21:43,891 --> 00:21:46,891
If we find it before this alarm turns red,

393
00:21:46,891 --> 00:21:48,291
there would be no meaning.

394
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:51,191
The place we can find something after it gets red is...

395
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:52,491
the crossing bar.

396
00:22:01,491 --> 00:22:02,591
Shinichi?

397
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:03,691
Did you find it?

398
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:06,691
"Erase the mark of Okuho."

399
00:22:06,691 --> 00:22:08,691
"Clench your teeth in solitaire with an unclear voice"

400
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,791
-"Erase..." -"Erase..."

401
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:13,891
"The mark of Okuho."

402
00:22:13,891 --> 00:22:17,391
"Clench your teeth in solitaire with an unclear voice."

403
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,991
The third code?

404
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:48,891
Next Conan's Hint:

405
00:24:48,891 --> 00:24:51,691
"The person who gave Thief Kid his name"

406
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:54,791
Toriya floodgate, a flood gate case indeed.
