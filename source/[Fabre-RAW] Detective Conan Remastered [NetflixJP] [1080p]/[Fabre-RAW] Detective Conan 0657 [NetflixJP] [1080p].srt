1
00:00:03,229 --> 00:00:07,229
An old pot is found in the storeroom of Dr. Agasa's house.

2
00:00:07,229 --> 00:00:09,429
Wanting the pot to be appraised,

3
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:12,429
Doc uploaded the pot on a video site,

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,629
but who would've known that doing

5
00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:15,995
so would lead to an incident like this.

6
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:18,629
While we were out buying groceries to make curry,

7
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:19,629
we got home to find that Dr. Agasa

8
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:21,029
was fainted after being attacked with a stun gun,

9
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:24,029
and that Ayumi had been kidnapped.

10
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:28,007
At first we thought that somebody had come after the pot,

11
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:29,729
but the pot was found left behind.

12
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:31,329
And, instead, the carpet that was found together

13
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:33,629
with the pot was gone.

14
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:36,629
It seems to have been used to carry Ayumi out.

15
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:40,929
Mail sent by the culprit was eventually received.

16
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:42,021
It demanded that the cat that was shown

17
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:43,429
in the attachment be searched for,

18
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:46,629
and that Ayumi will be kept hostage in exchange for the cat.

19
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:50,629
We split up to look for the cat, but to no avail.

20
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:51,729
It's getting close to sundown

21
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:53,029
and we were starting to get panicky

22
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:55,629
when the culprit sent us another mail.

23
00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:57,429
It said that they had found the cat on their own

24
00:00:57,429 --> 00:00:59,029
so they would be releasing Ayumi.

25
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:02,041
Ayumi was found safe,

26
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,529
but what on earth was the culprit after anyway.

27
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:26,629
If all cases were men,

28
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:28,529
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

29
00:01:28,529 --> 00:01:30,069
Glimpses of the Organization are here and there.

30
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:32,071
Could they be after the pot, the cat or Haibara?

31
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:33,629
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:35,529
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:38,077
His name is Detective Conan.

34
00:03:02,746 --> 00:03:08,167
"Doc's Video Site (Part 2)"

35
00:03:10,546 --> 00:03:13,046
In other words, the cat keeper of some rich person,

36
00:03:13,046 --> 00:03:17,146
carelessly makes the cat get away and panics.

37
00:03:17,146 --> 00:03:19,046
Then, wanting to get the cat back,

38
00:03:19,046 --> 00:03:21,946
he commits a kidnapping case.

39
00:03:21,946 --> 00:03:23,646
But, it ends up being a stupid story

40
00:03:23,646 --> 00:03:25,646
where the keeper eventually finds the cat on his own.

41
00:03:25,646 --> 00:03:27,746
But if so, he should've just truthfully said,

42
00:03:27,746 --> 00:03:29,446
"Since it's my master's cat,

43
00:03:29,446 --> 00:03:32,546
if you find it, please return it".

44
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,846
I wonder. If people find out that his master is super rich,

45
00:03:35,846 --> 00:03:38,197
maybe he was afraid that an exorbitant reward would be demanded

46
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:41,046
and that his master would find out that the cat got away.

47
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:44,203
No, I don't think it's that simple of a case.

48
00:03:44,446 --> 00:03:47,246
No matter if we went out shopping,

49
00:03:47,246 --> 00:03:51,246
unless the culprit knew that only Doc and Ayumi were staying back home,

50
00:03:51,246 --> 00:03:53,346
it's unthinkable that he would try to break in

51
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:55,446
with just a stun gun.

52
00:03:55,446 --> 00:03:59,446
Besides, we were gone for only less than 30 minutes.

53
00:04:00,246 --> 00:04:02,221
If it was a house that he were entering for the first time,

54
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:04,946
do you think he could've made Doc faint,

55
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:07,946
then check to see if the cat was anywhere in the house,

56
00:04:07,946 --> 00:04:12,746
wrap Ayumi in the carpet and carry her out?

57
00:04:12,746 --> 00:04:14,546
In addition, the culprit also found Doc

58
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,235
and Ayumi's cell phones too.

59
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:18,646
Then don't tell me that the culprit...

60
00:04:18,646 --> 00:04:22,846
Yeah, he knew, that Doc and Haibara were living here,

61
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,246
just the two of them together in this house.

62
00:04:25,246 --> 00:04:28,846
And that we four came over here to play often too.

63
00:04:28,846 --> 00:04:32,251
As well as the fact that all of us have cell phones too.

64
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:34,846
But, how did they get that information?

65
00:04:34,846 --> 00:04:38,257
Didn't anyone you don't know recently come over?

66
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:40,246
Come to think of it, yes.

67
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:41,546
About 3 groups of people.

68
00:04:41,546 --> 00:04:42,646
3 groups?

69
00:04:42,646 --> 00:04:45,046
You see, they came after seeing

70
00:04:45,046 --> 00:04:47,246
the video site that I just showed you.

71
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:48,267
And?

72
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:50,846
What kind of people did the 3 groups consist of?

73
00:04:50,846 --> 00:04:55,746
The first group was a young pair of sisters.

74
00:04:55,746 --> 00:04:57,846
They lifted the pot, tapped on it

75
00:04:57,846 --> 00:04:59,546
and kept staring at it for a while

76
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:02,281
but, they asked me to sell it to them for 500 yen.

77
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:06,846
500 yen? Is that pot so invaluable?

78
00:05:06,846 --> 00:05:09,246
I asked the same question too.

79
00:05:09,246 --> 00:05:10,846
They weren't sure either,

80
00:05:10,846 --> 00:05:12,291
but it seems that at the cost of 500 yen,

81
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:15,346
they thought they could use it as a flower pot.

82
00:05:15,346 --> 00:05:18,046
They asked me to check on it in more detail,

83
00:05:18,046 --> 00:05:20,299
but they left saying that their legs went numb.

84
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:22,301
Was the pot left on the floor?

85
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:25,646
Yeah. On top of that carpet.

86
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:28,307
I thought it would look nicer that way.

87
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:31,246
The next group that came was a middle-aged couple.

88
00:05:31,246 --> 00:05:32,646
They carefully checked the pot

89
00:05:32,646 --> 00:05:35,846
using a magnifying glass without touching the pot at all.

90
00:05:35,846 --> 00:05:38,317
And? What did they say?

91
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:41,646
They told me that maybe it could be a very valuable pot,

92
00:05:41,646 --> 00:05:46,325
so to take it to a legitimate appraiser.

93
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:48,646
They also told me that there may be people

94
00:05:48,646 --> 00:05:50,329
who'd want to buy it at an unreasonably cheap price

95
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:54,333
so that it may be better if I don't show it too much to others.

96
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,846
Then, what about the 3rd group?

97
00:05:56,846 --> 00:05:59,446
They were a very rude father and son!

98
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:02,341
After touching the pot just a little and looking inside it

99
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:05,446
the son asked, "How much do you think this is?"

100
00:06:05,446 --> 00:06:07,546
He said so, with a grin on his face

101
00:06:07,546 --> 00:06:10,146
so I got upset and said, "It's about 500,000 yen!"

102
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:12,646
I told him that I'll give him the carpet along with it

103
00:06:12,646 --> 00:06:13,746
if he bought it now.

104
00:06:13,746 --> 00:06:16,946
The father said, "You've gotta be joking".

105
00:06:16,946 --> 00:06:18,346
The son also said laughing,

106
00:06:18,346 --> 00:06:20,846
"I pity people who don't have an eye for things".

107
00:06:20,846 --> 00:06:23,146
So I got angry and kicked them out of the house!

108
00:06:23,146 --> 00:06:27,446
And? Was Haibara close to you then?

109
00:06:27,446 --> 00:06:31,846
No, the three groups came while Ai was in school, you see.

110
00:06:32,846 --> 00:06:34,746
Come to think of it.

111
00:06:34,746 --> 00:06:36,375
There was someone who asked a lot about Ai,

112
00:06:36,546 --> 00:06:38,046
including what time she comes back from school,

113
00:06:38,046 --> 00:06:40,379
about her friends,

114
00:06:40,546 --> 00:06:43,046
or about what she usually does on Saturdays and Sundays.

115
00:06:43,046 --> 00:06:45,546
Isn't that person the culprit?

116
00:06:45,546 --> 00:06:48,387
Don't you remember who it was?

117
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:52,746
No... I think it was someone among the three groups though.

118
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,393
Wasn't there anyone among

119
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:56,846
the three groups that asked about a cat?

120
00:06:56,846 --> 00:07:00,399
Especially someone who asked about this Russian Blue?

121
00:07:01,346 --> 00:07:03,946
It was mostly talk about the pot, you see.

122
00:07:03,946 --> 00:07:06,405
Russian Blue?

123
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:10,409
If I remember correctly, Ran's mother also has a Russian Blue.

124
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:11,646
If it's a pot and cat,

125
00:07:11,646 --> 00:07:13,246
you can find it on a pot-cat video site, right?

126
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:14,746
What's that?

127
00:07:14,746 --> 00:07:18,417
The cat going inside the pot is really cute.

128
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:20,446
Hey, Doc!

129
00:07:20,446 --> 00:07:22,946
What did name the title of the video you uploaded?

130
00:07:22,946 --> 00:07:24,423
If I remember correctly...

131
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:25,946
I think it was, "Although this pot is like casting pearls before swine,

132
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,246
that is, throwing gold before cats for me,

133
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,446
I would like to have it appraised".

134
00:07:29,446 --> 00:07:33,046
If so, we can search for videos concerning cats and pots.

135
00:07:35,346 --> 00:07:38,437
I found it. It's Ran's mother's video.

136
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:41,746
It's one above Doc's video site.

137
00:07:41,746 --> 00:07:43,746
It's a cat pot!

138
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:46,445
No, don't go in there.

139
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:48,046
How cute!

140
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:51,246
Goro chan, say hi to everyone!

141
00:07:52,446 --> 00:07:56,446
Hey, doesn't that cat look like the culprit's cat?

142
00:07:56,446 --> 00:07:59,346
True, even the background looks similar!

143
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:02,246
But how come Ms. Kisaki's cat...

144
00:08:02,246 --> 00:08:07,246
There's no reason that she would pass me out with a stun gun, is there?

145
00:08:07,246 --> 00:08:12,046
Wait. I wonder why the culprit didn't use the stun gun on Ayumi?

146
00:08:12,046 --> 00:08:14,146
If he passed her out like he did Doc,

147
00:08:14,146 --> 00:08:17,946
he wouldn't have had to change his voice using helium gas.

148
00:08:17,946 --> 00:08:19,646
I wonder why?

149
00:08:21,446 --> 00:08:24,846
There something on your ear.

150
00:08:24,846 --> 00:08:27,446
This is when I tried to run from the culprit,

151
00:08:27,446 --> 00:08:31,146
coffee spilled, and I was pushed downward on it

152
00:08:31,146 --> 00:08:34,493
so that's why I got coffee on my hood.

153
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:37,946
You sure got a lot of coffee on your hood.

154
00:08:37,946 --> 00:08:40,499
When I was wrapped around with the carpet,

155
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:42,846
the coffee came soaking all the way up to my ear

156
00:08:42,846 --> 00:08:45,646
and really felt gooey!

157
00:08:45,646 --> 00:08:48,507
I'm sorry I got your clothes dirty, Ai.

158
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:52,511
No problem, I can get it clean by washing it.

159
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:54,946
I see. So in other words,

160
00:08:54,946 --> 00:08:58,846
the culprit's target was neither Haibara, the pot nor the cat.

161
00:08:58,846 --> 00:09:01,746
So, what do you intend to do about this case then?

162
00:09:01,746 --> 00:09:03,846
Are you going to report it to the police anyway?

163
00:09:03,846 --> 00:09:05,146
I guess so

164
00:09:05,146 --> 00:09:08,527
since it's a fact that Ayumi was kidnapped too.

165
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:11,046
But, I wonder if they'd believe us?

166
00:09:11,046 --> 00:09:13,146
A story like two people wearing caps

167
00:09:13,146 --> 00:09:14,846
suddenly break into the house,

168
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,046
make Doc faint using a stun gun,

169
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:20,846
wrap Ayumi inside the carpet and carry her off.

170
00:09:20,846 --> 00:09:22,246
Moreover, that the purpose of the culprit

171
00:09:22,246 --> 00:09:25,146
was for us to find the cat owned by his master

172
00:09:25,146 --> 00:09:27,146
that ran away near here.

173
00:09:27,146 --> 00:09:28,546
True.

174
00:09:28,546 --> 00:09:30,846
The two kidnappers sent us mail demanding for us

175
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:32,551
to look for their cat

176
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:34,946
from the cell phone they stole from Dr. Agasa.

177
00:09:34,946 --> 00:09:38,557
And that mail was sent to Ayumi's cell phone

178
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:40,546
that was inside the pot.

179
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,246
On top of that, both kidnappers

180
00:09:42,246 --> 00:09:44,563
had changed their voices with helium gas

181
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:46,146
and we've got no clue.

182
00:09:46,146 --> 00:09:48,346
I'm sure that Ayumi who was wrapped in the carpet

183
00:09:48,346 --> 00:09:51,546
wouldn't have had an idea of where she was taken to

184
00:09:51,546 --> 00:09:53,446
nor how she got back either.

185
00:09:53,446 --> 00:09:55,746
But, Ayumi, you said

186
00:09:55,746 --> 00:09:57,246
that they let you out of the carpet once

187
00:09:57,246 --> 00:09:59,546
and let you drink water, right?

188
00:09:59,546 --> 00:10:01,946
Weren't you at the culprits' hide out?

189
00:10:02,946 --> 00:10:04,946
It was dark and I couldn't see well,

190
00:10:04,946 --> 00:10:08,346
but it seems that I was in a moving car or something.

191
00:10:09,346 --> 00:10:14,246
The only clue that we have is this image of the cat

192
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,595
that the culprit demanded us to look for, but...

193
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:18,597
Since it looks exactly like the image of the cat

194
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:21,746
that Ms. Kisaki had uploaded on her site.

195
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,746
It could be that they borrowed

196
00:10:23,746 --> 00:10:26,605
the image of the same type of cat

197
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:28,607
and sent it to us.

198
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:31,646
But, somebody may have witnessed

199
00:10:31,646 --> 00:10:34,046
suspicious people carrying out the carpet,

200
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:37,046
so I think we should contact the police either way.

201
00:10:37,046 --> 00:10:40,946
Why don't we call them after we make the curry?

202
00:10:40,946 --> 00:10:44,246
I mean, I'm really starving.

203
00:10:44,246 --> 00:10:45,646
I guess so.

204
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:48,246
Okay, I guess I'll go take a bath then.

205
00:10:48,246 --> 00:10:50,946
Because my ear is still stained with coffee.

206
00:10:50,946 --> 00:10:52,246
Hold it!

207
00:10:53,446 --> 00:10:55,446
I'm sorry, but will you take a bath

208
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,446
after the culprits are arrested.

209
00:10:58,637 --> 00:11:01,246
Because that coffee stain is important evidence

210
00:11:01,246 --> 00:11:04,946
that shows that the culprit pushed you down on the stain,

211
00:11:04,946 --> 00:11:07,746
rendered you helpless, wrapped you in the carpet

212
00:11:07,746 --> 00:11:09,846
and carried you away, you see.

213
00:11:09,846 --> 00:11:14,653
What? You mean I can't take a bath until the culprits are caught?

214
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:17,946
Well, it'll only be a little while.

215
00:11:17,946 --> 00:11:20,046
Because we're going to raid

216
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,546
the culprits' place together starting now.

217
00:11:21,546 --> 00:11:22,661
What?

218
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:25,646
Are you saying that you figured out who the culprits are?

219
00:11:25,646 --> 00:11:29,646
Yeah, it's probably somebody that you know, Doc.

220
00:11:29,646 --> 00:11:33,246
Somebody I know?

221
00:11:41,062 --> 00:11:42,681
Somebody I know?

222
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:44,962
Don't tell me that you're saying that Ms. Kisaki is the culprit.

223
00:11:44,962 --> 00:11:46,685
No.

224
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:49,762
Just as you said the image of that cat

225
00:11:49,762 --> 00:11:52,462
was one that the culprit sent at random.

226
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:56,695
And, it just happened to be Attorney Kisaki's cat.

227
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:58,362
At random?

228
00:11:58,362 --> 00:12:00,262
You mean the culprit didn't kidnap Ayumi

229
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,962
in order to search for the cat?

230
00:12:02,962 --> 00:12:05,762
No, anything would've been fine.

231
00:12:06,862 --> 00:12:10,709
As long as they had something that sounded appropriate enough

232
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:12,462
to carry Ayumi out of the house

233
00:12:12,462 --> 00:12:13,762
after wrapping her in the carpet.

234
00:12:13,762 --> 00:12:16,062
You mean, they demanded the cat to be searched for

235
00:12:16,062 --> 00:12:18,062
just as a make-shift reason?

236
00:12:18,062 --> 00:12:21,762
Yeah. Don't you think it's strange?

237
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:24,723
Doc was shot with a stun gun that fainted him and yet

238
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:28,362
all they did to Ayumi was seal her mouth with masking tape.

239
00:12:28,362 --> 00:12:30,462
Thanks to that, we found out from the conversation of the culprits

240
00:12:30,462 --> 00:12:33,662
that they came here to look for the cat that ran away,

241
00:12:33,662 --> 00:12:36,062
and that they had no choice

242
00:12:36,062 --> 00:12:37,662
but to wrap Ayumi in a carpet

243
00:12:37,662 --> 00:12:40,739
in order to make us search for that cat.

244
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:44,743
But, if they made Ayumi faint like they did to Doc,

245
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:46,062
to begin with, they wouldn't have had

246
00:12:46,062 --> 00:12:48,747
to change their voices using helium gas, did they?

247
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:49,962
I guess so.

248
00:12:49,962 --> 00:12:53,062
In spite of that, the only reason for them doing so would've been

249
00:12:53,062 --> 00:12:57,262
because the culprits wanted Ayumi to hear their conversation.

250
00:12:57,262 --> 00:12:59,562
They did so in order to distract everyone

251
00:12:59,562 --> 00:13:02,762
from the fact that they were actually after the carpet.

252
00:13:02,762 --> 00:13:04,562
What? The carpet?

253
00:13:04,562 --> 00:13:07,962
You mean that old looking carpet is expensive?

254
00:13:07,962 --> 00:13:10,362
No, I'm pretty sure that this is cheap stuff.

255
00:13:10,362 --> 00:13:12,462
Then, why?

256
00:13:12,462 --> 00:13:14,773
Like Doc was saying just a while ago.

257
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:16,462
Although the back side of the carpet was stained,

258
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,562
the front had no stains what so ever on it when it was returned.

259
00:13:19,562 --> 00:13:22,062
While Ayumi was wrapped in the carpet,

260
00:13:22,062 --> 00:13:23,862
the coffee that soaked through her hood

261
00:13:23,862 --> 00:13:26,062
stained her ear too, you know.

262
00:13:26,062 --> 00:13:29,762
Then, shouldn't there be a coffee stain somewhere on the carpet?

263
00:13:29,762 --> 00:13:32,791
However, the fact that there is no such stain anywhere means...

264
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:33,962
I see.

265
00:13:33,962 --> 00:13:38,062
They switched the carpet when they let Ayumi drink water.

266
00:13:38,062 --> 00:13:39,262
Yeah.

267
00:13:39,262 --> 00:13:42,362
They let Ayuymi out of the carpet once in the dark

268
00:13:42,362 --> 00:13:45,462
so that she wouldn't realize that they switched the carpet.

269
00:13:45,462 --> 00:13:47,162
I'm sure that they had another carpet

270
00:13:47,162 --> 00:13:49,262
that looked similar to this one inside their car beforehand,

271
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:52,462
so that they could switch it right away.

272
00:13:52,462 --> 00:13:55,562
But then they didn't have to go as far as to kidnap Ayumi, did they?

273
00:13:55,562 --> 00:13:58,817
Right! All they had to do was steal the carpet!

274
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:00,562
I see!

275
00:14:00,562 --> 00:14:02,062
If the carpet were stolen,

276
00:14:02,062 --> 00:14:03,462
it would be reported to the police as such,

277
00:14:03,462 --> 00:14:05,762
so they wouldn't be able to sell it off even if they wanted to.

278
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:11,862
Yeah. The pattern of the carpet is clearly shown on your video too.

279
00:14:11,862 --> 00:14:14,062
But, I don't think I have any acquaintances

280
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,262
that would do something like that around me.

281
00:14:16,262 --> 00:14:20,162
It could be someone that you recently met just once.

282
00:14:20,162 --> 00:14:22,062
Recently?

283
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:24,462
Don't tell me it's the one who came to appraise that pot.

284
00:14:24,462 --> 00:14:25,562
Yeah.

285
00:14:25,562 --> 00:14:28,362
Or the sisters who were lifting the pot,

286
00:14:28,362 --> 00:14:30,849
touching it and staring at it for a while,

287
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:33,162
the couple who were carefully checking the pot using a magnifying glass

288
00:14:33,162 --> 00:14:35,662
without touching it at all.

289
00:14:35,662 --> 00:14:37,362
Or, the father and son who were told by you

290
00:14:37,362 --> 00:14:39,362
that you would sell the pot along with the carpet for 500,000 yen

291
00:14:39,362 --> 00:14:41,862
and laughed about it.

292
00:14:41,862 --> 00:14:44,462
That would make the last father and son suspicious.

293
00:14:44,462 --> 00:14:46,865
Yes. I'm sure they knew the real value of the carpet

294
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:49,462
and wanted to buy it at an even lower price.

295
00:14:49,462 --> 00:14:50,869
No, just the opposite.

296
00:14:51,062 --> 00:14:54,162
They laughed because Doc mentioned a price that was much too cheap.

297
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:56,875
Judging from the fact that they wanted

298
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,462
to get a hold of your carpet despite

299
00:14:58,462 --> 00:14:59,962
having to kidnap a child means that your carpet

300
00:14:59,962 --> 00:15:01,662
was probably a Persian carpet.

301
00:15:01,662 --> 00:15:03,862
It's said that not one carpet has the same pattern

302
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:04,883
and depending on the carpet,

303
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:07,362
it could easily range over 10 million yen.

304
00:15:07,362 --> 00:15:09,562
What? Ten million yen?

305
00:15:09,562 --> 00:15:11,362
It's true that looking at the pattern of aging

306
00:15:11,362 --> 00:15:13,662
on the outside and inside of the object in question,

307
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,862
is one way of appraisal,

308
00:15:15,862 --> 00:15:19,262
but the father and son had an eye for antiques

309
00:15:19,262 --> 00:15:20,462
because they could tell the value by just a slight touch

310
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:22,462
and quick look inside the pot.

311
00:15:22,462 --> 00:15:25,162
I'm sure they could tell right off that it was a Persian carpet,

312
00:15:25,162 --> 00:15:27,362
but they aren't the culprits.

313
00:15:27,362 --> 00:15:28,662
Why?

314
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:30,262
If they went as far as to cause an incident like this

315
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,462
just to get a hold of the carpet,

316
00:15:32,462 --> 00:15:33,762
there's no reason why they wouldn't go

317
00:15:33,762 --> 00:15:35,662
for an offer of 500,000 yen, is there?

318
00:15:35,662 --> 00:15:39,362
Then, you mean the very first pair of sisters who came here is the culprit?

319
00:15:39,362 --> 00:15:42,162
Why isn't it the couple that came here second?

320
00:15:42,162 --> 00:15:43,562
Of course not.

321
00:15:43,562 --> 00:15:46,062
Because the couple kindly told me

322
00:15:46,062 --> 00:15:47,962
that the pot may be valuable

323
00:15:47,962 --> 00:15:50,462
so to show it to an appraiser.

324
00:15:50,462 --> 00:15:52,931
They were referring to the pot, weren't they?

325
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:54,162
Besides, to put it accurately,

326
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:57,762
they recommended you to take it over to an appraiser

327
00:15:57,762 --> 00:15:59,862
to get it appraised, didn't they?

328
00:15:59,862 --> 00:16:00,939
Yeah.

329
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:02,941
On second thought, they could be telling you

330
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:04,943
not to call anyone here anymore because they don't want anyone

331
00:16:05,162 --> 00:16:08,962
to realize that it is a Persian carpet, right?

332
00:16:08,962 --> 00:16:10,949
Besides, contrary to the sisters who raised

333
00:16:11,162 --> 00:16:13,262
the pot up and stared at it for a while,

334
00:16:13,262 --> 00:16:15,562
the couple didn't touch the pot even once

335
00:16:15,562 --> 00:16:17,662
and checked it with a magnifying glass, right?

336
00:16:17,662 --> 00:16:19,862
Yeah, that's right.

337
00:16:19,862 --> 00:16:22,962
The sisters who had their minds only on the pot, would've done so,

338
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:24,963
but not so for the couple.

339
00:16:25,162 --> 00:16:27,962
If you had the pot on the carpet,

340
00:16:27,962 --> 00:16:30,762
they could've seen the carpet through the magnifying glass, right?

341
00:16:30,762 --> 00:16:34,362
I see! The thing that the couple was checking...

342
00:16:34,362 --> 00:16:36,262
Was the pattern of the carpet.

343
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:37,662
They were not only checking

344
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:40,462
if it was a real Persian carpet,

345
00:16:40,462 --> 00:16:42,981
but also confirming whether it was the really the carpet

346
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:45,562
that they were looking for.

347
00:16:45,562 --> 00:16:48,662
They probably saw the carpet once somewhere

348
00:16:48,662 --> 00:16:51,762
and were dying to have it.

349
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:54,562
Otherwise, they would never jump

350
00:16:54,562 --> 00:16:57,362
at something they coincidentally saw at a video site.

351
00:16:57,362 --> 00:17:00,362
Then, they used the excuse of appraising the pot

352
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:02,762
and came here to check out the carpet.

353
00:17:02,762 --> 00:17:04,362
They found out that Doc not only didn't know the value of the pot,

354
00:17:04,362 --> 00:17:07,005
but neither he have any knowledge of the value of the carpet.

355
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:08,362
I'm sure that after finding out that just Haibara

356
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:13,011
and you were living here together, they thought up the crime.

357
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:17,015
But, how are we going to pinpoint where the culprits are?

358
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:19,017
Judging from the fact that they didn't want Ayumi

359
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:21,019
to recognize their voices,

360
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:24,362
it's most likely that they are running a store near here.

361
00:17:24,362 --> 00:17:26,162
We can probably find them quite easily

362
00:17:26,162 --> 00:17:28,162
if we narrow the shops down to those that sell carpets.

363
00:17:28,162 --> 00:17:32,062
Yes, yes, I'm already doing so.

364
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:33,862
I found it.

365
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:37,035
Interior shop Kanbe on 3rd Avenue.

366
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:39,037
It seems that they carry carpets too.

367
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:42,262
The president's face also seems to be on the website,

368
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,462
but is he the one?

369
00:17:45,762 --> 00:17:47,862
That's right. It's him.

370
00:17:47,862 --> 00:17:49,762
No mistake about it.

371
00:17:51,062 --> 00:17:52,562
Bingo.

372
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:01,059
If I remember correctly, you're...

373
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:03,562
It's amazing how you found my residence.

374
00:18:03,562 --> 00:18:05,562
When I went to your shop last week,

375
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:06,862
I was told that you were off from work

376
00:18:06,862 --> 00:18:10,062
because of a cold, you see.

377
00:18:10,062 --> 00:18:11,362
But, judging from the looks of it,

378
00:18:11,362 --> 00:18:13,762
it seems you've completely recovered already.

379
00:18:13,762 --> 00:18:15,862
Huh? Oh, no.

380
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:19,662
I still have a bit of cough.

381
00:18:19,662 --> 00:18:21,362
By the way, what brings you here?

382
00:18:21,362 --> 00:18:24,462
I heard that your shop carries carpets too,

383
00:18:24,462 --> 00:18:27,762
so I wanted you to look at the carpet I have.

384
00:18:27,762 --> 00:18:28,862
I see.

385
00:18:28,862 --> 00:18:31,562
And, who are those children?

386
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:37,095
I couldn't bring it here alone so I had them help me.

387
00:18:43,662 --> 00:18:45,962
It's very well made but...

388
00:18:45,962 --> 00:18:48,262
It seems to be fake.

389
00:18:48,262 --> 00:18:50,662
Just as I thought, after all.

390
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:54,862
Well, there are many fake Persian carpets going around.

391
00:18:54,862 --> 00:18:56,262
Then, is this carpet

392
00:18:56,262 --> 00:18:59,117
that is standing against the wall authentic?

393
00:19:00,162 --> 00:19:02,362
Yeah. That one's authentic.

394
00:19:03,762 --> 00:19:06,562
There something stuck between the carpet.

395
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,162
It looks to be a picture.

396
00:19:08,162 --> 00:19:09,962
A picture of what?

397
00:19:09,962 --> 00:19:11,462
This is...

398
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:15,133
It's a picture of a carpet!

399
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:17,135
It looks just like Doc's carpet.

400
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:19,137
But why would a picture like this be here?

401
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:20,762
Oh... well...

402
00:19:20,762 --> 00:19:22,862
My wife is a bit of a scatterbrain, you see.

403
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,662
Right?

404
00:19:24,662 --> 00:19:26,562
Well... Yes!

405
00:19:26,562 --> 00:19:30,462
I always get newspapers and stuff stuck in between.

406
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:32,462
I thought that you rushed and folded the carpet

407
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:35,962
because Doc came home while you were comparing the carpet with the picture,

408
00:19:35,962 --> 00:19:38,162
so it got stuck in between,

409
00:19:38,162 --> 00:19:41,562
but I guess it was just my imagination.

410
00:19:42,762 --> 00:19:44,562
Let's try spreading it out then!

411
00:19:44,562 --> 00:19:45,962
Yes!

412
00:19:45,962 --> 00:19:47,762
Hold it!

413
00:19:50,462 --> 00:19:54,062
Oh, my. It looks just like Doc's carpet.

414
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:56,962
But, it seems the pattern is a bit different?

415
00:19:56,962 --> 00:20:00,862
It seems that the carpet in the picture is this one.

416
00:20:00,862 --> 00:20:02,562
Oh goodness!

417
00:20:02,562 --> 00:20:05,183
There's ear shaped stain.

418
00:20:06,362 --> 00:20:09,862
Judging from the smell. It seems to be coffee.

419
00:20:09,862 --> 00:20:11,189
My wife did that too.

420
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:14,862
Because I'm a scatterbrain, I was rushing and...

421
00:20:14,862 --> 00:20:16,962
Don't you know?

422
00:20:16,962 --> 00:20:19,562
The shape of an ear is called an ear print

423
00:20:19,562 --> 00:20:25,203
and like fingerprints there is no one person with the same prints.

424
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:26,362
So, I'm sure that if we match the stain

425
00:20:26,362 --> 00:20:30,562
with Ayumi's ear print, it'll readily become obvious...

426
00:20:32,162 --> 00:20:34,762
that you're the ones, the kidnappers,

427
00:20:34,762 --> 00:20:38,462
who wrapped Ayumi in this carpet.

428
00:20:38,462 --> 00:20:39,862
What's with you?

429
00:20:39,862 --> 00:20:42,862
Who the hell are you?

430
00:20:42,862 --> 00:20:44,662
Conan Edogawa.

431
00:20:44,662 --> 00:20:46,262
A detective.

432
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:49,962
After a while, the police arrived

433
00:20:49,962 --> 00:20:52,962
and the kidnappers were taken to the police.

434
00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:54,962
It seems that the carpet that Doc had belonged

435
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,662
to a certain tycoon, but since he passed away,

436
00:20:57,662 --> 00:20:59,237
his bereaved family who received the carpet as a keepsake,

437
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:01,762
seem to have passed it on from person to person,

438
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:05,243
where it ended up at Doc's place.

439
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:07,245
The kidnapper couple seems to have

440
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:08,962
worked on the interior of that tycoon too.

441
00:21:08,962 --> 00:21:10,662
And after hearing that his bereaved family unaware

442
00:21:10,662 --> 00:21:12,862
of the value of the carpet sold it off,

443
00:21:12,862 --> 00:21:16,062
had been pursuing its whereabouts.

444
00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:18,162
They happened to find the carpet

445
00:21:18,162 --> 00:21:21,962
because Mrs. Kanbe was hooked on the "Pot Cat Video Site".

446
00:21:21,962 --> 00:21:24,262
They seem to have come up with their scheme when they saw the girl

447
00:21:24,262 --> 00:21:26,562
that was reflected on the lens of his glasses,

448
00:21:26,562 --> 00:21:29,062
and when they found Attorney Kisaki's cat one above Doc's video site,

449
00:21:29,062 --> 00:21:31,262
they decided to use it to get a hold of the carpet they were dying to have.

450
00:21:31,262 --> 00:21:35,273
That seems to have been the motive for the crime they committed.

451
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:38,262
By the way, after finding out that he owned

452
00:21:38,262 --> 00:21:40,162
a genuine Persian carpet, Doc was delighted.

453
00:21:40,162 --> 00:21:41,862
However, he was disappointed to hear that

454
00:21:41,862 --> 00:21:43,281
he would only get the carpet back

455
00:21:43,281 --> 00:21:44,762
after the incident and trial of the case end,

456
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,962
which would take several months.

457
00:21:46,962 --> 00:21:49,287
His dream of wanting to purchase a new Beetle

458
00:21:49,462 --> 00:21:51,662
would have to wait for a while now.

459
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,062
But I wonder if everything will be okay?

460
00:21:56,062 --> 00:21:57,295
What?

461
00:21:57,295 --> 00:22:00,362
My reflection that was on Doc's glasses.

462
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:02,662
It's been distributed throughout the world, wasn't it?

463
00:22:02,662 --> 00:22:04,162
No problem!

464
00:22:04,162 --> 00:22:06,362
That video site has already been deleted,

465
00:22:06,362 --> 00:22:07,662
and besides the kidnapper also said that

466
00:22:07,662 --> 00:22:10,162
he coincidentally saw you only

467
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,311
when he zoomed in on the pattern of the carpet.

468
00:22:13,311 --> 00:22:18,562
Hold it. How did she find Haibara's image?

469
00:23:43,062 --> 00:23:46,662
Delete...

470
00:23:48,462 --> 00:23:50,762
Delete.

471
00:23:52,562 --> 00:23:56,162
If it's data it can be deleted right away, but...

472
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

473
00:24:03,644 --> 00:24:05,680
"Table cloth"

474
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,312
In the next episode super delicious chocolate will make an appearance!

475
00:24:08,312 --> 00:24:09,760
I'd like to have a taste of it too.

476
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,980
No chocolate for you.
