1
00:00:04,273 --> 00:00:08,873
Well, thank you so much for everything.

2
00:00:08,873 --> 00:00:11,573
Thanks so much for breakfast too.

3
00:00:11,573 --> 00:00:12,673
No, not at all.

4
00:00:12,673 --> 00:00:16,573
Please forgive us for this was an unexpected occurrence!

5
00:00:16,573 --> 00:00:17,997
Baloney.

6
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:20,473
You were planning to spend the night here to begin with.

7
00:00:20,473 --> 00:00:22,973
Because you had change of clothes prepared too.

8
00:00:22,973 --> 00:00:25,373
See you soon then, Ran.

9
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:26,573
See you.

10
00:00:26,573 --> 00:00:28,773
I'll be going too, then.

11
00:00:28,773 --> 00:00:31,773
Please drop by next time on your day off.

12
00:00:31,773 --> 00:00:34,573
Yes, sir, goodbye.

13
00:00:34,573 --> 00:00:35,673
Huh?

14
00:00:35,673 --> 00:00:38,017
Where are you going, Mr. Otaki?

15
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:39,773
Tokyo Station is this way.

16
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:42,021
Yeah, you go on ahead.

17
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:46,025
I've got some business to finish off.

18
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:47,373
I see.

19
00:00:49,573 --> 00:00:52,873
The place is on the border of Saitama and Gunma prefecture.

20
00:00:52,873 --> 00:00:55,173
It's a western style mansion in the remote mountains.

21
00:00:55,173 --> 00:00:57,073
Tomorrow night they're having a conference

22
00:00:57,073 --> 00:01:00,039
concerning inheritance of the estate.

23
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:03,373
Could you please attend it?

24
00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:05,373
-"Heizo Hattori" -"According to the client,

25
00:01:05,373 --> 00:01:06,973
-"Police Chief of Osaka," -it seems that the actions

26
00:01:06,973 --> 00:01:09,273
-"Heiji's father" -of the owner of the mansion,

27
00:01:09,273 --> 00:01:11,673
the inheritee is extremely weird.

28
00:01:11,673 --> 00:01:14,973
Therefore, we got a call asking for police personnel

29
00:01:14,973 --> 00:01:17,373
to sit in at the conference.

30
00:01:17,373 --> 00:01:20,873
Oh. Well, I don't mind.

31
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,473
There was a murder

32
00:01:22,473 --> 00:01:25,073
near the forest where that mansion is

33
00:01:25,073 --> 00:01:27,373
and there're weird rumors going around too,

34
00:01:27,373 --> 00:01:30,773
so this is not an order.

35
00:01:30,773 --> 00:01:34,573
But, if you're going to attend, be careful

36
00:01:34,573 --> 00:01:36,673
not to let them suck your blood.

37
00:01:36,673 --> 00:01:38,873
What're they going to suck?

38
00:01:40,373 --> 00:01:41,573
You've been mumbling.

39
00:01:41,573 --> 00:01:44,873
I'm not going to be sucked and such for some time now.

40
00:01:44,873 --> 00:01:46,773
Heiji?

41
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:50,973
I hope you're not talking about the lips of a woman.

42
00:01:50,973 --> 00:01:53,273
Since when were you in the car?

43
00:01:53,273 --> 00:01:55,473
We snuck in when you stopped

44
00:01:55,473 --> 00:01:58,097
at the service station to the restroom.

45
00:01:58,097 --> 00:01:59,673
You didn't realize we were here?

46
00:01:59,673 --> 00:02:02,673
Pops and everyone else is here too.

47
00:02:05,273 --> 00:02:07,673
But why?

48
00:02:07,673 --> 00:02:10,109
They want to gaze upon the face of the woman

49
00:02:10,273 --> 00:02:12,673
you're secretly meeting with, Mr. Otaki!

50
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:17,473
But, we had no idea that you had a woman here.

51
00:02:17,473 --> 00:02:18,773
Ran and the others said that

52
00:02:18,773 --> 00:02:20,773
they want to introduce her to them too!

53
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:24,973
Well, it's not a woman good enough to show you all.

54
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,127
Then will you tell us?

55
00:02:28,127 --> 00:02:29,873
What kind of case is it?

56
00:02:31,373 --> 00:02:33,373
It's a case, isn't it?

57
00:02:33,373 --> 00:02:37,173
Since you're keeping it from me, I'll bet Dad's involved?

58
00:02:40,473 --> 00:02:42,473
Well, you see, six months ago...

59
00:02:42,473 --> 00:02:44,143
A woman's body was found in the forest

60
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:47,573
near the mansion that we're headed for now.

61
00:02:47,573 --> 00:02:49,073
She was found dead ruthlessly

62
00:02:49,073 --> 00:02:53,573
tied upside down on a stake that stood vertically.

63
00:02:54,153 --> 00:02:56,773
That's super gross.

64
00:02:56,773 --> 00:03:00,173
That woman used to be the maid for that mansion.

65
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:04,163
But, since the way her body was found was sort of strange.

66
00:03:04,163 --> 00:03:06,165
Sort of strange, how?

67
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:08,873
The old couple who found the corpse

68
00:03:08,873 --> 00:03:10,673
thought at first that it was a scarecrow

69
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:12,173
to keep bears away

70
00:03:12,173 --> 00:03:15,573
since the skin of the corpse was so white.

71
00:03:15,573 --> 00:03:18,177
That's probably because the culprit cut her artery,

72
00:03:18,373 --> 00:03:21,173
bled her to death, and tied her there.

73
00:03:21,173 --> 00:03:23,173
But, there seems to have been no such

74
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:25,573
large wounds anywhere on her body.

75
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:30,973
All they found were two holes on her neck.

76
00:03:30,973 --> 00:03:33,773
Two holes in her neck and she bled to death?

77
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:36,473
Hey. Dont tell me that's...

78
00:03:36,473 --> 00:03:37,473
Yeah.

79
00:03:37,473 --> 00:03:42,201
Otaki, do you believe they exist in this world?

80
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:43,873
Vampires?

81
00:03:47,373 --> 00:03:49,173
Aim for a 100% solution.

82
00:03:49,173 --> 00:03:51,573
Clear all mysteries and codes.

83
00:03:51,573 --> 00:03:53,373
Dracula exists?

84
00:03:53,373 --> 00:03:55,573
The curtains are raised to a shocking case.

85
00:03:55,573 --> 00:03:57,073
He sees through the one and only truth.

86
00:03:57,073 --> 00:03:58,973
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

87
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:01,773
His name is Detective Conan!

88
00:05:42,098 --> 00:05:47,998
"Heiji Hattori and the Vampire Mansion (One)"

89
00:05:49,198 --> 00:05:51,298
Vampire?

90
00:05:51,298 --> 00:05:54,333
Are you saying that the murderer was a vampire?

91
00:05:54,498 --> 00:05:57,398
It's just a rumor with no grounds.

92
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,898
It seems that such a feudal lord

93
00:05:58,898 --> 00:06:01,598
used to govern this area in the past, you see.

94
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:03,398
A feudal lord?

95
00:06:03,398 --> 00:06:07,098
And? That murderer hasn't been arrested yet?

96
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:08,347
No.

97
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:10,798
But, I'm sure you at least found a suspect.

98
00:06:10,798 --> 00:06:13,198
Yes. The first to be suspected

99
00:06:13,198 --> 00:06:16,698
was the owner of the mansion, Mr. Hakuya Torakura.

100
00:06:16,698 --> 00:06:18,698
It seems that the maid who was killed

101
00:06:18,698 --> 00:06:21,198
had confided in the Chef of the mansion.

102
00:06:21,198 --> 00:06:23,098
That the owner of the mansion had been acting eerie recently

103
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:26,798
and that she wanted to quit because she felt endangered.

104
00:06:26,798 --> 00:06:28,698
Then, it was the owner who did it after all.

105
00:06:28,698 --> 00:06:30,369
Oh, no.

106
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:32,998
He had an alibi.

107
00:06:32,998 --> 00:06:36,998
At the estimated time of death of the maid Ms. Shimizu,

108
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:38,698
the owner's alibi was that

109
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,798
he was confined to his room and asleep right through.

110
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:44,383
Ironically, the one who testified to this

111
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:49,698
was the Chef, who Ms. Shimizu had confided in.

112
00:06:49,698 --> 00:06:52,198
Thank you for coming.

113
00:06:52,198 --> 00:06:55,098
You're Inspector Otaki from the Osaka City Police, aren't you?

114
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:56,395
Yes.

115
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:58,397
So, you must be the one who called?

116
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:00,198
I'm Koga, the butler.

117
00:07:00,198 --> 00:07:04,403
I was a comrades of Chief Hattori's father.

118
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:06,405
What is this about?

119
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:07,998
That the actions of the owner of this mansion's

120
00:07:07,998 --> 00:07:09,698
been eerie recently?

121
00:07:09,698 --> 00:07:12,411
Yeah. Recently, the owner

122
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:13,898
has been avoiding exposure to sunlight

123
00:07:13,898 --> 00:07:16,898
and sleeping all during the day.

124
00:07:16,898 --> 00:07:19,098
He also suddenly started saying that

125
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:20,998
he's become allergic silver and stopped using

126
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:22,898
the silverware he had been using all this time

127
00:07:22,898 --> 00:07:24,698
and disposed of them all.

128
00:07:24,698 --> 00:07:27,098
The other day, he cracked the soup dish

129
00:07:27,098 --> 00:07:29,298
that had his favorite garlic flavor in it.

130
00:07:29,298 --> 00:07:31,498
And said angrily, "Don't ever put garlic inside

131
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:33,398
because it'll rot my blood!"

132
00:07:33,398 --> 00:07:35,898
Hey. It sounds just like...

133
00:07:35,898 --> 00:07:38,437
Yes. It seems to have looked that way

134
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:40,798
to the maid, Ms. Shimizu.

135
00:07:40,798 --> 00:07:44,898
He's just like a Dracula, a vampire.

136
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,798
Vampire?

137
00:07:46,798 --> 00:07:49,498
Didn't he just say vampire?

138
00:07:49,498 --> 00:07:51,498
What about the vampire?

139
00:07:51,498 --> 00:07:52,451
Oh, no.

140
00:07:52,698 --> 00:07:54,798
Bumper, the bumper.

141
00:07:54,798 --> 00:07:57,398
We were discussing what to do about the dent

142
00:07:57,398 --> 00:07:59,198
we made in the bumper of the rental car!

143
00:07:59,198 --> 00:08:01,898
Oh, the bumper.

144
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,463
Hey! Come on in, Heiji and all of you!

145
00:08:04,698 --> 00:08:07,098
It's like a castle and fantastic!

146
00:08:08,798 --> 00:08:11,098
It's almost sundown

147
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:13,998
and about time that the owner will be getting up.

148
00:08:13,998 --> 00:08:16,475
Please make yourselves at home

149
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:18,477
until it's time for dinner.

150
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,198
Oh, yes.

151
00:08:21,198 --> 00:08:22,798
The talk about the inheritance

152
00:08:22,798 --> 00:08:26,998
of the estate in question will be discussed after dinner.

153
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:29,798
I wonder if Inspector Otaki's sweetheart

154
00:08:29,798 --> 00:08:32,798
is really in this mansion?

155
00:08:32,798 --> 00:08:35,698
You mean you still believe that?

156
00:08:37,298 --> 00:08:39,398
This is amazing!

157
00:08:39,398 --> 00:08:42,501
I've only ever seen something like this in movies or dramas.

158
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:44,503
To think I'm actually experiencing it!

159
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:45,998
True.

160
00:08:45,998 --> 00:08:48,507
I feel like we've become nobles too.

161
00:08:48,698 --> 00:08:50,509
Who are you?

162
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,298
-"Ruri Torakura (38), Asanobu's wife" -Don't tell me that

163
00:08:53,298 --> 00:08:55,898
you're brother-in-law's love children or something.

164
00:08:55,898 --> 00:08:57,698
No way.

165
00:08:59,098 --> 00:09:03,498
If so, he'd never ask us to come over here.

166
00:09:03,498 --> 00:09:06,525
True. If he really had love children,

167
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:09,398
Hakuya's inheritance wouldn't be given to us, his siblings

168
00:09:09,398 --> 00:09:12,531
but rather, all to his children.

169
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:14,998
But, you never know.

170
00:09:14,998 --> 00:09:18,198
He suddenly brought a young beautiful fiance

171
00:09:18,198 --> 00:09:21,698
with children here a few years ago, didn't he?

172
00:09:21,698 --> 00:09:25,198
It's no surprise if he had two or three love children, right?

173
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:29,098
Well, although that fiance unfortunately died.

174
00:09:29,098 --> 00:09:30,549
Oh, I get it!

175
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:32,551
For you guys, I guess I should say fortunately?

176
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:34,198
Hey, you.

177
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:37,398
Watch it!

178
00:09:37,398 --> 00:09:39,398
If you ever say something like that again,

179
00:09:39,398 --> 00:09:41,098
you're really going to get it!

180
00:09:41,098 --> 00:09:42,898
What's with you?

181
00:09:42,898 --> 00:09:45,998
I'll bet you thought you were lucky too, didn't you?

182
00:09:45,998 --> 00:09:48,898
Oh, don't tell me that

183
00:09:48,898 --> 00:09:52,571
you were really hooked on that lover with children?

184
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:54,573
Why you...

185
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:57,698
Will you cut out the stuff about his lover?

186
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:01,098
After all, I'm the child of my father's lover too, you know.

187
00:10:01,098 --> 00:10:05,798
Well, but if the inheritee only had siblings,

188
00:10:05,798 --> 00:10:08,587
the amount of estate to be received would be the same,

189
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:10,198
so let's stay on peaceful terms.

190
00:10:10,198 --> 00:10:11,298
Excuse me.

191
00:10:12,298 --> 00:10:14,398
The Chef told me to ask you

192
00:10:14,398 --> 00:10:16,298
if it's about time that we start serving dinner.

193
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:19,198
Oh, but if you're still not finished talking,

194
00:10:19,198 --> 00:10:20,898
a little while later would do.

195
00:10:20,898 --> 00:10:23,398
We can talk over dinner too,

196
00:10:23,398 --> 00:10:24,998
so why don't you hurry and start serving?

197
00:10:24,998 --> 00:10:28,098
Well, as for a mere love child of that woman,

198
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:30,609
it would be of no concern though.

199
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:34,898
This is a typical battle over inheritance.

200
00:10:34,898 --> 00:10:36,098
I guess so.

201
00:10:37,398 --> 00:10:40,098
Huh? An incurable disease?

202
00:10:41,698 --> 00:10:42,621
Mr. Hakuya Torakura,

203
00:10:42,798 --> 00:10:44,398
the owner of this mansion is afflicted?

204
00:10:44,398 --> 00:10:47,298
Yes, that at most, he only had six more months.

205
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:50,398
Oh? Wasn't it three months?

206
00:10:50,398 --> 00:10:53,598
That's why we came to this dinner meeting tonight.

207
00:10:53,598 --> 00:10:55,198
Well, with something like

208
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:56,635
no inheritance for those who don't attend

209
00:10:56,798 --> 00:10:59,398
written on the invitation card, who wouldn't...

210
00:10:59,398 --> 00:11:01,798
But, what's taking him so long?

211
00:11:01,798 --> 00:11:04,098
You're right. At this point, he'd usually

212
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:06,098
be complaining about the food.

213
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,398
Okay then, girls. I hate to trouble you,

214
00:11:08,398 --> 00:11:10,649
but, won't you go and wake him up?

215
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:12,398
-Huh? -Us?

216
00:11:12,398 --> 00:11:13,798
Turn right at the corridor

217
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,798
and it's the room at the very end.

218
00:11:15,798 --> 00:11:18,398
True. Hakuya may feel much happier

219
00:11:18,398 --> 00:11:21,598
if two young girls go to wake him up.

220
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:25,398
The room at the very end would be...

221
00:11:25,398 --> 00:11:27,098
This one, right?

222
00:11:27,098 --> 00:11:29,198
But, don't you think it's strange?

223
00:11:29,198 --> 00:11:34,098
Would you normally ask your guests to do something like this?

224
00:11:34,098 --> 00:11:35,398
Huh?

225
00:11:35,398 --> 00:11:37,298
There's no bed.

226
00:11:37,298 --> 00:11:39,498
Hey, no way?

227
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:42,681
-A coffin? -I see, I got it!

228
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:45,398
I thought that when they sent us to wake him up,

229
00:11:45,398 --> 00:11:47,498
everybody was sort of grinning.

230
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,298
I'll bet they wanted to frighten us

231
00:11:49,298 --> 00:11:51,998
by making us wake a man who is asleep in the coffin up!

232
00:11:51,998 --> 00:11:55,398
No one should go into something like this before dying.

233
00:12:09,298 --> 00:12:11,398
What is it, what's wrong?

234
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,998
The man's in here.

235
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:18,717
He's just asleep.

236
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:20,498
He sleeps in there recently saying that

237
00:12:20,498 --> 00:12:22,721
he's eventually going in there anyway.

238
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:24,198
He was splattered with blood

239
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:26,098
with a stake poked into his chest, you know?

240
00:12:26,098 --> 00:12:27,698
Splattered with blood?

241
00:12:27,698 --> 00:12:29,998
He's taking his joke a bit too far.

242
00:12:29,998 --> 00:12:33,398
It's no joke, he's dead!

243
00:12:33,398 --> 00:12:36,298
What's going on here? It won't open!

244
00:12:39,998 --> 00:12:42,198
There's nobody in here!

245
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:43,598
No way?

246
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:45,498
Are you sure he was in here?

247
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,747
Yep. I think he was.

248
00:12:48,998 --> 00:12:53,398
You mean he evaporated and vanished?

249
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,698
As if he was some sort of monster...

250
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,600
We're not lying!

251
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,200
He was really sleeping in here!

252
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,800
With blood splattered and a stake

253
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,767
pierced through his chest.

254
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:10,769
He was wearing a black cape.

255
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:11,700
He had pointy ears

256
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,400
and had something that looked like fangs too.

257
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,773
As if he were...

258
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:17,500
Count Dracula!

259
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,300
He looked like...

260
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,100
Count Dracula?

261
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,800
Come to think of it, he was called by that nickname

262
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,500
when he was a child.

263
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,600
Count Dracula because he was Hakuya Torakura.

264
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,100
A nickname that only children would think of.

265
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,000
But, that nickname.

266
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,400
Maybe it wasn't just a play on words?

267
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,200
When you take into consideration

268
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,000
-the ancestors of the Torakura family. -True.

269
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,500
In addition, the eerily strange actions of Hakuya

270
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,400
in recent years.

271
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,800
Maybe he was really possessed

272
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,811
by a vampire.

273
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,800
It's a joke, only joke!

274
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,900
Hakuya doesn't have pointed ears

275
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,900
nor does he have fangs.

276
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,821
If what you saw was Hakuya,

277
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,100
he was trying to scare you by dressing up like a monster!

278
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,827
I don't know what trick he used to

279
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:10,829
disappear from the coffin though.

280
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:14,600
Well, to vanish just like magic...

281
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,500
you can see stuff like that in the movies etc.

282
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,600
It's indeed what a vampire would do.

283
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Why you...

284
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
How dare you talk about Hakuya as if he were a monster!

285
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,800
I'll bet I'm not the only one who thinks so.

286
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,500
Right, Mr. Butler?

287
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,847
You asked them to come here

288
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:31,100
because you thought so too, right?

289
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,851
Yes, sir.

290
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:38,100
Because the owner was acting much too eerie recently.

291
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,859
I decided to have these police detectives

292
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:44,400
sit in on the talk about inheritance.

293
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,900
Police detectives?

294
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,500
I'm Otaki from the Osaka City Police Department.

295
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,500
He is Detective Kogoro Mouri.

296
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,871
-No way. -Don't tell me

297
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:54,300
he's the Sleeping Kogoro?

298
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,400
The one and only!

299
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,500
Excuse me.

300
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,800
Your food's getting cold.

301
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Would you like me to warm it up again?

302
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,500
Hey, Mr. Otaki.

303
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,800
I'm sorry to interrupt you when you're talking but...

304
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,700
Can I have you go to a police station nearby

305
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,500
and check this red thing out?

306
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,800
If it was as Kazuha and Ran saw,

307
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,400
this should be Mr. Torakura's blood.

308
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,903
Hakuya didn't show up after all.

309
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:26,400
It was written on the invitation card that

310
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,900
the talk would take place after dinner and yet...

311
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,300
Well, it didn't say that we were going to be having the talk

312
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,300
in the dining room either.

313
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,600
Hey, Conan. Dad's not around, is he?

314
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,917
Pops said he was going to buy cigarettes

315
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,900
and left by car with Inspector Otaki.

316
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,800
Hey. Why don't we at least finish taking pictures?

317
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,500
What's that about?

318
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,600
Every time we have a family gathering like this,

319
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,400
we take pictures together.

320
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,933
They've been doing this from three generations before!

321
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,700
But are you going to take pictures

322
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,400
without the owner of the mansion?

323
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,939
Yeah. Even last year,

324
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,900
Hakuya came bursting into the room saying, "Don't forget me."

325
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,400
True.

326
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,900
If we all get on with enjoying ourselves,

327
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,951
he might just pop in.

328
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,500
Mina, pull your chin in a bit.

329
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
Come on, sis.

330
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Just how long are you going to spend fixing your hair?

331
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,700
You're not gonna get any younger no matter how long you mess with it!

332
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,600
Shut up.

333
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,965
Don't worry.

334
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:28,967
You're still beautiful, honey.

335
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,600
Thank you.

336
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,600
Okay, when I go over to that other side,

337
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,800
push the shutter, will you?

338
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,400
Oh, okay.

339
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,000
Okay, everybody, get ready!

340
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,900
-Say! -Cheese.

341
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,989
What's the fuss about?

342
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,600
Just now, behind everyone...

343
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,100
The man who was sleeping a while ago in the coffin!

344
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,999
What? Where is he?

345
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,400
He was here a while ago!

346
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,100
In between Johei and Kamiyo.

347
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,007
With a pale face like a ghost.

348
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,011
Right, right! What I saw was something like that too!

349
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:14,700
Hey, both of you!

350
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,500
That's enough.

351
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,800
I'll bet you heard of the vampire rumor

352
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,600
and came along with the detectives.

353
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,200
But stop making a fuss as if you came to

354
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,400
some haunted mansion or something!

355
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,027
Vampire rumor?

356
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:30,100
What's that about?

357
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,031
Huh? Don't tell me you don't know about it?

358
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:36,500
Six months ago, in the forest near this mansion,

359
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,037
Ms. Shimizu who used to work as a maid here

360
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:41,400
was found dead.

361
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,500
All the blood from her body was drained

362
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,300
and she was tied upside down onto a stake

363
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,047
poked into the ground.

364
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:51,900
Moreover, two holes were found on the neck of the corpse,

365
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,000
so there was a big fuss over it.

366
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,400
That a vampire appeared.

367
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,800
At any rate, let's split up and go look for Hakuya!

368
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,500
If we leave things as is,

369
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,200
he may really end up being thought of as a monster.

370
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,700
Is it true, Heiji?

371
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,800
That story about the vampire just now?

372
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,067
Yeah.

373
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,500
If we told you, you'd say you want to leave right away.

374
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,500
Then, we'd end up having to leave with you.

375
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,500
That's why we didn't tell you about it.

376
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,800
They're gone!

377
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
Over there.

378
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,200
Hey, you! Where're you going?

379
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,600
Huh? You want to eat food with garlic in it?

380
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,500
But, you already ate dinner a while ago, didn't you?

381
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
There was no garlic in the food!

382
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,095
If you let us use this kitchen and give us the ingredients,

383
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:39,400
we'll make it ourselves.

384
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,000
But the owner recently says he hates garlic, you see.

385
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,900
So, I wonder if there's any garlic around?

386
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,600
Oh, we can manage on our own.

387
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,800
We'll look for it ourselves.

388
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:53,500
Garlic for vampires?

389
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,600
Well, that's the usual.

390
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,100
Huh? This refrigerator won't open!

391
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,500
Oh, that's the refrigerator that the owner bought the other day

392
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,600
and it's locked.

393
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,125
A refrigerator with a lock?

394
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,200
Why?

395
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,127
Beats me.

396
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:12,200
I was told that it was to keep good beef

397
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,400
to serve to the guests that would coming today.

398
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,300
I didn't get to use it though.

399
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,139
Hey.

400
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:23,141
Are you the one, by the way?

401
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,900
Who testified during the incident six months ago

402
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,400
that the owner had an alibi?

403
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,500
Yeah.

404
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,600
If I remember correctly, you said that

405
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,300
the owner was confined to his room and asleep right through.

406
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,155
Yeah. There's no mistake about that!

407
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:38,600
Because he told me that day that

408
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,600
he wanted to check on the taste of the soup

409
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,000
right after he got up, so for me, the chef,

410
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,700
to wake him up and bring the soup to him in person.

411
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,000
Then, it's not that you were watching over that coffin right through

412
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,100
while the owner was asleep, eh?

413
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,400
No, but I'm sure that he never came out of that coffin!

414
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,175
He told me before he closed the lid of the coffin.

415
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,700
That he felt like somebody's been opening the lid of the coffin

416
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,300
while he's asleep and watching him,

417
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,700
so to put something on top of the lid.

418
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,700
That's why I place three grains of sesame seed on the lid.

419
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,700
And when I went to wake him,

420
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,600
the seeds were in place just like I placed them.

421
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,700
That means that the lid of the coffin wasn't opened, isn't it?

422
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,800
Which means that this coffin is what's suspicious, but...

423
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,800
It doesn't look like there's any hole

424
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,800
under tile of the coffin either.

425
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,900
No.

426
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,213
But, why was the lid closed?

427
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,600
Because the lid closes only up to here.

428
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,219
If anyone saw him splattered with blood,

429
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,000
they would panic and let go of the lid.

430
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,400
No, the lid wouldn't open when we first tried to open it, right?

431
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,400
Right.

432
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,600
Besides, there's something about this room,

433
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
a strange something that doesn't feel right.

434
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,700
What was that sound?

435
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,000
It seems to have sounded from quite a distance away.

436
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,600
Hey, take a look at that.

437
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,247
The forest is burning.

438
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,200
Collapsed?

439
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,300
Are you saying the tunnel collapsed

440
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,100
due to an unknown explosion?

441
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,000
Yeah. I confirmed by phone a while ago and was told so.

442
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,259
No joke?

443
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:23,900
That's the only road that leads up to here, you know.

444
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,600
It seems it'll take some time before it's restored.

445
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,800
My God.

446
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,500
It's not a problem about having to look for Hakuya anymore.

447
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,271
Which means that the owner hasn't been found yet?

448
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:36,800
No. We've all split up and tried looking for him though.

449
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,200
By the way, have you seen my sweetheart?

450
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,700
She hasn't been around for a while.

451
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,283
Come to think of it, Kishiharu's not around either.

452
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,285
As for Kishiharu, he said that

453
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:50,300
he was going to develop the pictures that we took a while ago

454
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,800
after turning his room into a dark room.

455
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,800
It's really unusual that he still uses an analog camera

456
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,600
in this day and age, isn't it?

457
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,700
Well, sorry that I'm such an analog person.

458
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,600
But thanks to me being that way, I've figured out

459
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
the situation that Hakuya's in now.

460
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,300
Huh? You mean you found him?

461
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,800
Yeah. He's in the picture.

462
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,500
In the picture?

463
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,400
Just as those girls said.

464
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,700
In the room where the picture was taken.

465
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,317
He was right near us.

466
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,600
He's turned into a monster who can go through walls.

467
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,220
Next Conan's Hint:

468
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,460
"Garlic"

469
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,380
Hattori, what're you looking for?

470
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:52,500
Garlic, a cross and a silver spoon.
Hattori, what're you looking for?

471
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,940
Garlic, a cross and a silver spoon.

472
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,413
Hey, calm down!
