1
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,990
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,190
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,090
The name of the stage is OK Ranch.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,090
A single combat unfolds between crime and deduction.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,690
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,590
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,890
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,350
It feels so good!

9
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,150
Doesn't it, doesn't it?

10
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,150
There's nothing better the nature.

11
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:10,750
But, Dad, why did you suddenly decide to come driving?

12
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,250
Well, I wonder why...

13
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,050
We passed here before, didn't we?

14
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,050
What?

15
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,950
Oh, really?

16
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,850
We're here now.

17
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,450
We came this way, and when to this way, so...

18
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,050
Let me check. Where are we headed for?

19
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,650
Well...

20
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,550
Dad, pull over to the side.

21
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,650
That's it!

22
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,450
Wait for me!

23
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,050
"Okusu Ranch"

24
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,250
-Okusu Ranch? -Okusu Ranch?

00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,450
"Okusu Ranch"

27
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,550
Well, you were a great help.

28
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,750
Thanks to you I was able to make it here in time.

29
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,750
No problem.

30
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,050
After all, we haven't had people come visit us for a long time.

"Hirohito Ninomiya (28), Part-time ranch worker"

32
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,650
It's a ranch for horses.

33
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,350
So, Pops just brought us along so he could enjoy his horses.

34
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,950
I just thought that I'd let you have your fill of nature.

35
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,050
Go home!

36
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,750
Get out of here right this minute!

37

"Real estate agent" -because I'm busy too, you know.

39
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,550
Just make sure that you don't goof on

40
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,050
the timing of selling this place.

41
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,750
Well...

42
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,750
I'm sorry about the scene just now.

43
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,750
"Tomoyuki Okusu (50), Ranch owner" -Welcome to OK Ranch.

44
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,650
I am Okusu, the owner of this ranch.

45
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,650
OK Ranch?

46
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,650
The name of the ranch is taken from

47
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,350
the first two letters of my last name, OK.

48
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,850
Nothing's been okay around here recently though.

"OK Ranch"

50

That's right.

51

Here, sonny, would you like some chocolate?

52
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,650
It's good!

53
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,350
Chocolate.

54
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,150
No, thank you.

55
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,650
Alright.

56
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,150
Fantastic.

57
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,250
I'm sorry I'm late.

58
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,350
I am your guide, Takeuchi.

59
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,650
Nice to meet you all.

60
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,950
(Sanae Takeuchi (21), Part-time ranch worker)

61
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,750
All the horses that are owned,

62
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,350
are out because it's horse racing season right now.

63
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,050
I wonder if you'll be able to see any horses you know.

64
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,250
Isn't this horse Madame Leap?

65
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,150
Yes. She's a stock mare.

66
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,050
I made a lot of money off her in the past.

67
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,750
How nostalgic.

68
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,750
Thank you for all the cash you brought in back then.

69
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,250
But, you don't look too well.

70
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,350
She experienced still birth,

71
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:22,550
and is not able to have any more babies.

72
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,050
I see, poor thing.

73
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,750
The racing stable over there is used for bringing up colts.

74
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,950
It's not in use right now,

75
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,050
but if you'd like to see it...

76
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,450
Hi, Sanae, guests?

77
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,050
Yes.

78
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,350
Hi, there! Good work,

79
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,550
take care of Madame Leap for me today, will you?

80
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,750
Sir, this is the guy that I've taken care of

81
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,250
ever since he used to be a jockey,

82
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,850
"Motoo Sugiyama (37), Farrier" -Motoo Sugiyama.

83
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,250
He is currently one of the most sought after farriers of the times.

84
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,250
A farrier?

85
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,950
A blacksmith, a professional at making horseshoes.

86
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:23,050
Horses that live along with human beings go through rigorous exercise.

87
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,350
Therefore, their hooves get scraped.

88
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:31,050
That's why they need horseshoes to protect the hooves.

89
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,350
Therefore, they periodically take off the horseshoe...

90
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,550
and shave off the outgrown hoof.

91
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,550
Then, in order to match the hoof that has been shaved,

92
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,750
a new horseshoe is put in place of the old one.

93
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,650
You sure are knowledgeable, sir.

94
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,850
Ms. Takeuchi is not going to have anything to do.

95
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,850
Oh no, it's just that I've heard a little about it before.

96
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,550
The new horseshoe is heated in flames,

97
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,750
then shaped to match the hoof of the horse.

98
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:07,550
The hooves of horses are all shaped differently.

99
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:11,150
That goes all four hooves of one horse too.

100
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,350
Is that so...

101
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,850
Are you all right, Conan?

102
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,050
Well, I'll be you're glad that we came, aren't you?

103
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,050
Yes.

104
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,250
Madame Leap.

105
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,850
Mr. Ninomiya, Madame Leap is...

106
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,550
What's wrong?

107
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,250
Madame Leap has run loose.

108
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,250
"Okusu Ranch"

109
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,150
Steady...

110
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,150
Calm down.

111
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,350
Steady...

112
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,850
-It's the first time that something like this ever happened. -Steady...

113
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,350
Good girl.

114
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,650
Calm down.

115
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,950
Steady...

116
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,550
Blood?

117
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,300
Don't tell me that...

118
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,600
Conan!

119
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,500
Mr. Sugiyama?

120
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,600
Sugiyama!

121
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,500
No good, he's already dead!

122
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,100
He's bleeding from his head, which means...

123
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,200
he may have been kicked by Madame Leap.

124
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,000
Oh no.

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,900
That can't be.

126
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,300
At any rate, please call the police.

127
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,100
That's right.

128
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,100
Please tie Madame Leap to the wash place or something.

129
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,500
Yes, sir.

130
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,300
What's this?

131
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,000
A piece of chocolate?

132
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,200
Its right hind leg seems to be wounded...

133
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,000
Unreal.

134
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,500
The nail isn't hammered in right.

135
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,900
The shape of the horseshoe doesn't match.

136
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,300
Why would Mr. Sugiyama do something terrible like this?

137
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,900
But, wait a second.

138
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,000
Maybe...

139
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,500
Conan!

140
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,400
It's dangerous.

141
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,700
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,200
Okay, okay. Calm down.

143
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,100
Maybe giving her something to drink will help.

144
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,900
Hey, Ran there was tea left in the thermos bottle, wasn't there?

145
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,500
No, not tea.

146
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,700
Although tea does not affect humans much,

147
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,000
it is a very strong stimulant for horses.

148
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,100
Tea is a stimulant?

149
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,400
Maybe this is not an accident.

150
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,500
There's no doubt about it.

151
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,600
He was kicked by the horse. See.

152
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,000
The traces of him have being kicked,

153
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,600
the mark of the horseshoe is left right here.

154
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,800
But, just to be safe, I think it would be better to double check

155
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,300
whether the horseshoe matches that of the horse.

156
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,600
Excuse me, but may I have your name please?

157
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,300
Pardon me, I'm a detective, so I...

158
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,400
I am Kogoro Mouri.

159
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,100
You mean that famous?

160
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,100
Please excuse me for my rudeness.

161
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,300
But, since this is an accident,

162
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,900
I guess your deductions won't be necessary.

163
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,800
I guess so.

164
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,000
By the way, what is going to become of Madame Leap?

165
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,200
Well...

166
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,600
If it is a violent horse maybe it would be better to get rid of it.

167
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,400
Oh no!

168
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Mr. Sugiyama's to blame! He deserved to die!

169
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,300
Sanae.

170
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,400
You mean, you don't like Mr. Sugiyama?

171
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,500
What do you mean by he deserved to die?

172
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,800
Mr. Mouri, let me explain.

173
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,800
It was when I went out to town to buy some things last night.

174
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,200
That car...

175
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,900
Isn't that Mr. Sugiyama's car?

176
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Hey, he's...

177
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:38,000
Sugiyama was meeting Mochizuki who was trying to buy up this ranch.

178
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,400
Okusu is still wrapped up in making colts.

179
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,300
That's nice to know,

180
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,400
and I hope he fails again.

181
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,800
If he does, this time for sure he'll go bankrupt.

182
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,100
Which means you're going to do that again?

183
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,600
Yeah. I'm counting on you, Sugiyama.

184
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,400
Sugiyama was betraying Mr. Okusu,

185
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,100
the one who saved him, for money.

186
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,600
Sugiyama came along,

187
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,200
before we had a chance to tell Mr. Okusu about it.

188
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,560
In other words, Mr. Sugiyama, through orders of Mr. Mochizuki

189
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,760
was obstructing the horse from becoming pregnant

190
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,260
so that the ranch would fall into a financial rut.

191
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,960
Right. Producing horses cost an enormous amount of money.

192
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,060
If a horse is unable to have colts,

193
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,660
that itself is a great loss.

194
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,960
Which means that Madame Leap got messed up

195
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,260
in the ugly dispute between humans.

196
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,560
How terrible.

197
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,960
But, I wonder if that would make the horse take revenge?

198
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,360
Because if it did, it would be the same as the humans

199
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,060
who are doing those things.

200
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,560
That horse looks sad, but has nice eyes.

201
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,660
Hey! You stay out of this, kid!

202
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,760
I'm sorry.

203
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,560
Conan.

204
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,260
I'm sorry.

205
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,560
It's okay.

206
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,960
Your pants are wet.

207
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,760
I was cleaning the stalls and splashed water on myself.

208
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,160
I'm sorry, did I get you wet?

209
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,860
Nope, I'm okay.

210
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,760
I'm pretty sure that this case will be processed as an accident.

211
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,360
Thank you so much.

212
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,160
Officer, don't you have to take the horseshoe

213
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,060
that is the murder weapon with you?

214
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,760
Aren't the evidence going to be collected and taken to the police station?

215
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,660
Yeah... but...

216
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,560
If the horseshoe needs to be removed I'll do it now.

217
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,560
I used to do all the works in the past too.

218
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,060
Back then, I had no money to hire a specialist so...

219
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,260
I still don't.

220
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,360
I guess I'm in the same boat even now.

221
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,360
Please put it in this bag.

222
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,160
Okay, I've removed it.

223
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,060
Okay, everything's done.

224
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,460
Good girl, for sticking it out.

225
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:14,260
There's blood on the back of this horseshoe too.

226
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,060
He's right.

227
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,460
There's a lot of blood smeared on it.

228
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,860
That's strange.

229
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,560
Just as I thought.

230
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,760
I've figured everything out now.

231
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,260
The killer as well as how the crime was committed.

232
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,860
No matter how strong the horse is,

233
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,960
it's difficult for blood to find its way all the way behind the horseshoe.

234
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,360
If so, there is only one possible answer...

235
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,660
Blood was smeared onto the horseshoe beforehand?

236
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,960
Most likely, what happened then was...

237
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,160
But wait, that's Madame Leap's blood.

238
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,060
See, take a look.

239
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,160
The nail's been hammered in sloppily

240
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,960
that the veins have been damaged.

241
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,460
I tell you, that Sugiyama just did a really sloppy job.

242
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,160
It's not surprising that the horse go wild.

243
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,560
Dad.

244
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,060
Mr. Mouri, is anything wrong?

245
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,960
No, it's just that I've figured out who killed Mr. Sugiyama.

246
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,560
But, I thought this was an accident...

247
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,960
No, it is none other than homicide.

248
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,760
Conan, show everyone what you found.

249
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,760
Yes, sir.

250
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,960
Here it is.

251
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,160
This is what I picked up

252
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,760
at that wash place.

253
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,860
This is chocolate.

254
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,160
But, what about this?

255
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,160
If tea is a stimulant to horses,

256
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,960
wouldn't chocolate do the same?

257
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:54,460
Exactly, a substance called theobromine is in chocolate.

258
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:59,460
There is someone who gave chocolate to Madame Leap.

259
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,260
No way. Who could've done something so terrible?

260
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,360
Mr. Okusu, what did you do with the chocolate

261
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,460
that you offered Conan at the front desk a while ago?

262
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,660
That, well...

263
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,260
I left it back in my office.

264
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,460
If I remember correctly,

265
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,160
I think you put it away in your pocket back then?

266
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:27,660
Don't tell me that Mr. Okusu used chocolate to excite Madame Leap...

267
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,460
But, how can we tell whether Madame Leap ate the chocolate or not?

268
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,260
A simple urine test would do.

269
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:39,060
Besides, if the chocolate is checked for fingerprints

270
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,360
we can even conclude who gave it to the horse!

271
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
There is no need for that.

272
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,760
I gave Madame Leap the chocolate.

273
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,360
Oh, no...

274
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,460
Why? Why did you do such a thing?

275
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,360
Although I understand that you may have hated Mr. Sugiyama,

276
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,360
how could you even think of making Madame Leap kill Mr. Sugiyama?

277
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,510
Hold it, Sanae.

278
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:08,710
Madame Leap is not the one who killed Mr. Sugiyama.

279
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:13,510
The one who killed Mr. Sugiyama

280
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,510
is the one who put a horseshoe

281
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,310
that did not fit onto the right hind hoof of Madame Leap!

282
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,810
Which means that Mr. Sugiyama wasn't the one who put it on?

283
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,810
Of course not!

284
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,010
If a professional is to do an amateurish job like that,

285
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,110
even if it is to just get on someone's nerves,

286
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:33,010
he would lose his job on the spot.

287
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,910
And besides, the blood that was smeared on the back of the horseshoe

288
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:38,110
was Mr. Sugiyama's.

289
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,310
The killer probably struck the back of his head

290
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,710
with a brand new horseshoe.

291
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:50,310
Then, not knowing what to do with the blood smeared horseshoe,

292
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:55,010
the killer hurriedly put it on Madame Leap.

293
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,010
You would never do a sloppy job like that

294
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:01,310
no matter how much of a rush you were in, right, Mr. Okusu?

295
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,510
Could it have been the guy called Mochizuki,

296
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,010
who maybe got into a dispute with Sugiyama?

297
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,510
That is unthinkable,

298
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,410
because it would be much easier for him

299
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,210
to take the evidence along with him and walk out of here

300
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,710
before he is witnessed by anyone,

301
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:19,410
than to go out of his way to make it look like an accident.

302
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:22,510
Besides, if he had planned the murder beforehand,

303
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:26,010
he would have planned everything out more carefully.

304
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,310
Then, who did it?

305
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,310
Just as Sanae had pointed out,

306
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:35,910
Mr. Okusu would never do such a sloppy job.

307
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,310
But, judging from the fact that he wanted

308
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,110
to remove the horseshoe as soon as possible,

309
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:45,510
he must've know about the abnormal horseshoe at an early stage.

310
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,610
In order words, he figured out somehow from the situation at the scene,

311
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,510
who the killer was,

312
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,610
and in order to protect the killer,

313
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,410
gave Madame Leap the chocolate.

314
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,010
Then, went back to the main house

315
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,910
and waited for Madame Leap to go berserk.

316
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:07,010
He wanted we, the guests to hear the commotion.

317
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,910
A person that Mr. Okusu would want to protect enough

318
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,910
to even risk giving chocolate to beloved Madame Leap.

319
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:16,010
Sanae was with us all the way,

320
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:19,010
so she couldn't have committed the murder.

321
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,610
So, that leave us with no other choice than...

322
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,810
Mr. Ninomiya.

323
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,010
It was you.

324
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,510
Well?

325
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,810
No!

326
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:32,010
Your slacks seems to have been wet,

327
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,310
but, maybe if we check luminol reaction will appear?

328
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:40,610
Because you struggled to fit the blood smeared horseshoe on the horse,

329
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:47,810
despite it still not being shaped to fit the hoof of the horse yet.

330
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:53,810
Getting soiled by dirt happens every day on the ranch, but...

331
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,310
If it's the blood of the victim,

332
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,710
you'd have to wash it off, wouldn't you?

333
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,210
I didn't mean to kill him.

334
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,310
I really didn't mean to...

335
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,810
But, I just couldn't forgive him.

336
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,610
Not being able to bear it,

337
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:17,510
I pressed Sugiyama for an answer as to what we saw last night.

338
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,710
Then, he said that he would kill me

339
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,710
and simply make it look like the horse had an accident.

340
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,710
Then, he snickered.

341
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,510
While we were struggling...

342
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,810
Sugiyama died.

343
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:41,910
No matter if I was not myself when everything happened,

344
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,310
it is a fact that I tried to put the blame on Madame Leap.

345
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:49,510
And I'm the very one who should know more than anyone else

346
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,310
how despising it is to put the blame on a horse.

347
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,110
Mr. Okusu.

348
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:00,110
I'm sorry... I... I...

349
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,710
I'm the one who needs to apologize to you.

350
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:10,310
I sort of had an idea as to what Sugiyama was doing.

351
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,210
I kept it from you because I thought that if I let word out of it to you,

352
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,810
who have a strong sense of justice,

353
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,910
the problem would be blown out of proportion.

354
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,510
I should have told you about it somehow,

355
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,410
if things were going to turn out this way.

356
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,010
I'm so sorry, Ninomiya.

357
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:35,510
Mr. Ninomiya, Mr. Okusu...

358
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,810
Every person is responsible for compensating

359
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,510
for the crimes that he has committed.

360
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,810
No matter how much you protect the culprit

361
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,510
or try to cover up the crime that has been committed,

362
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:49,410
doing so is not a solution to the problem at all.

363
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,210
And, it doesn't matter what reasons may have existed

364
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,110
for committing the crime.

365
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,810
Go! Number two and number six!

366
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:32,210
Go for it! The black and green caps! Cheer them on!

367
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,310
Go for it! Number two! Number six!

368
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,010
-Go for it! -Amazing.

369
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:00,410
Now we know he's not off only when he makes deductions.

370
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,380
Next Conan's Hint:

371
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,440
"Silhouette"
