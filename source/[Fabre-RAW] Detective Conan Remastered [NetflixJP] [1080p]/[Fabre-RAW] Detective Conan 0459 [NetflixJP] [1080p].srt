1
00:00:01,444 --> 00:00:02,644
Commotion!

2
00:00:04,144 --> 00:00:06,144
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:08,244
A man who is strict about rules versus a woman who is not.

4
00:00:08,244 --> 00:00:09,944
A tragedy occurs between the two.

5
00:00:09,944 --> 00:00:11,444
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:12,944
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,944 --> 00:00:15,344
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:05,123
Are you really going to go look at it?

9
00:02:05,123 --> 00:02:07,523
Yes, for your sake, Genta!

10
00:02:08,923 --> 00:02:11,523
Geez. What a curiosity seeker.

11
00:02:11,523 --> 00:02:15,423
We only found out about that person a day ago.

12
00:02:15,423 --> 00:02:20,223
"Yesterday" -Oh, that doesn't go there, Kojima.

13
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:23,323
Oh, rats...

14
00:02:23,323 --> 00:02:26,223
Unburnable trash...

15
00:02:26,223 --> 00:02:28,523
Genta, make sure you sort the trash correctly!

16
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,523
Stupid, I just made a careless mistake.

17
00:02:31,523 --> 00:02:34,623
You're too careless, Genta.

18
00:02:34,623 --> 00:02:35,823
Oh...

19
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,123
If Mr. Iwata were here,

20
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:39,723
you'd be getting lectured for at least 30 minutes.

21
00:02:39,723 --> 00:02:41,523
Who's Mr. Iwata?

22
00:02:41,523 --> 00:02:44,023
A man who lives in our apartment.

23
00:02:44,023 --> 00:02:47,423
Oh, that's right, your family runs an apartment.

24
00:02:47,423 --> 00:02:53,123
Yes, Mr. Iwao Iwata who moved in about three months ago,

25
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:55,923
is super strict when it comes to throwing away trash.

26
00:02:55,923 --> 00:02:57,323
If you throw the trash out at a strange time,

27
00:02:57,323 --> 00:02:59,223
or dispose of trash without sorting it out,

28
00:02:59,223 --> 00:03:01,023
he finds out who did it

29
00:03:01,023 --> 00:03:04,723
and brings the trash bag back to that person.

30
00:03:04,723 --> 00:03:07,723
Oh, isn't that taking things a bit too far?

31
00:03:07,723 --> 00:03:10,323
He's really serious and extremely neat.

32
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:13,623
Yes, he's a very fine man.

33
00:03:13,623 --> 00:03:16,523
Rather, he's quite a weirdo.

34
00:03:16,523 --> 00:03:17,723
That's right!

35
00:03:17,723 --> 00:03:21,823
Let's go see that man called Mr. Iwao Iwata tomorrow.

36
00:03:21,823 --> 00:03:23,423
Go visit him?

37
00:03:23,423 --> 00:03:25,423
Let's go see the person who's serious and neat

38
00:03:25,423 --> 00:03:27,523
so that you can follow him as an example, Genta.

39
00:03:27,523 --> 00:03:29,023
What?

40
00:03:30,123 --> 00:03:31,323
Hey...

41
00:03:34,023 --> 00:03:36,223
So, we end up coming...

42
00:03:36,223 --> 00:03:38,623
-Good morning. -Good morning!

43
00:03:39,723 --> 00:03:41,623
He's Mr. Iwao Iwata.

44
00:03:41,623 --> 00:03:44,223
You're the one who put out this trash bag, aren't you?

45
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:46,623
A direct mail addressed to you is inside.

46
00:03:46,623 --> 00:03:48,723
Don't look into other people's trash bag!

47
00:03:48,723 --> 00:03:50,123
"Iwao Iwata (30)" -It's wet with rain

48
00:03:50,123 --> 00:03:51,823
so you threw it out last night.

49
00:03:51,823 --> 00:03:54,523
Trash is supposed to be thrown out in the morning.

50
00:03:54,523 --> 00:03:56,823
Why don't you follow the rules?

51
00:03:56,823 --> 00:04:00,223
This man is exactly as Chiharu said.

52
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:07,723
"The Abominable Man of Rules"

53
00:04:08,223 --> 00:04:12,623
On top of that, kitchen garbage, cans and Styrofoam are mixed in this bag.

54
00:04:12,623 --> 00:04:14,923
Sort your trash like you should!

55
00:04:14,923 --> 00:04:17,323
He sure looks worked up.

56
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:19,223
He doesn't have to get so furious.

57
00:04:19,223 --> 00:04:21,923
That just goes to show how serious he is.

58
00:04:21,923 --> 00:04:23,123
What?

59
00:04:25,823 --> 00:04:28,823
Okay. I will sort it!

60
00:04:28,823 --> 00:04:30,323
You better watch yourself!

61
00:04:30,323 --> 00:04:31,523
If you keep pushing your weight around,

62
00:04:31,523 --> 00:04:34,123
you're really going to get it one of these days!

63
00:04:39,323 --> 00:04:40,523
They're my classmates.

64
00:04:40,523 --> 00:04:41,923
Good morning!

65
00:04:41,923 --> 00:04:43,723
-Good morning! -Good morning!

66
00:04:43,723 --> 00:04:45,323
Morning.

67
00:04:45,323 --> 00:04:48,523
Your attitude of cautioning people to stick to the rules of society

68
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:50,523
was a great learning experience for us too.

69
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:54,323
Well, it's just that somebody's got to do it.

70
00:04:54,323 --> 00:04:55,423
Bye.

71
00:04:58,723 --> 00:05:02,423
But why can't he caution the person personally

72
00:05:02,423 --> 00:05:04,323
instead of in front of all those people,

73
00:05:04,323 --> 00:05:05,523
and so exaggeratedly too.

74
00:05:06,623 --> 00:05:08,523
There's a reason

75
00:05:08,523 --> 00:05:11,723
why Mr. Iwata became so strict about throwing trash out.

76
00:05:11,723 --> 00:05:13,123
What reason?

77
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:15,523
Soon after Mr. Iwata moved in,

78
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,223
the apartment was struck by an arsonist.

79
00:05:17,223 --> 00:05:18,323
Arson?

80
00:05:18,323 --> 00:05:19,523
The arsonist burned the trash

81
00:05:19,523 --> 00:05:21,423
that someone had thrown out in the middle of the night

82
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:22,923
without following the rules.

83
00:05:29,023 --> 00:05:31,823
Mr. Iwata happened to notice it and extinguished the fire

84
00:05:31,823 --> 00:05:33,323
so we were lucky, but...

85
00:05:36,323 --> 00:05:40,223
And that's why he became really strict about throwing out trash.

86
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,523
But like the man that he just razzed,

87
00:05:43,523 --> 00:05:45,723
if he's too hung up on rules and repeated about it,

88
00:05:45,723 --> 00:05:47,423
people around him are going to start hating him.

89
00:05:47,423 --> 00:05:49,923
That's what you call repaying kindness with resentment.

90
00:05:49,923 --> 00:05:51,723
Right, Conan?

91
00:05:51,723 --> 00:05:53,223
Conan?

92
00:05:53,223 --> 00:05:54,723
Yeah.

93
00:05:54,723 --> 00:05:57,823
Then, three days later, an incident occurs.

94
00:05:57,823 --> 00:06:00,623
"Three days later" -Homicide?

95
00:06:00,623 --> 00:06:02,123
Mr. Iwata...

96
00:06:02,123 --> 00:06:04,823
Didn't I tell you that he was going to be hated?

97
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,423
But, it can't be...

98
00:06:06,423 --> 00:06:07,623
No way!

99
00:06:07,623 --> 00:06:11,123
Poor thing, he was just trying to do the right thing...

100
00:06:11,123 --> 00:06:13,723
No, it's the other way around!

101
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:15,823
Mr. Iwata is the assaulter...

102
00:06:15,823 --> 00:06:16,823
-What? -What?

103
00:06:16,823 --> 00:06:18,323
He is?

104
00:06:24,723 --> 00:06:27,323
-Officer Takagi! -Officer Takagi!

105
00:06:27,323 --> 00:06:29,323
Oh, you guys.

106
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:30,623
What is it?

107
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:33,623
Is it true that Mr. Iwao Iwata really kill somebody?

108
00:06:33,623 --> 00:06:35,123
Is it really true?

109
00:06:35,123 --> 00:06:38,423
Do you guys know him?

110
00:06:38,423 --> 00:06:40,723
Yes. So tell us the details!

111
00:06:40,723 --> 00:06:43,523
It's true that he assaulted somebody.

112
00:06:43,523 --> 00:06:46,523
A woman, over how to throw trash out.

113
00:06:46,523 --> 00:06:48,323
-What? -Over how to throw trash out?

114
00:06:48,323 --> 00:06:50,523
"Interrogation room" -Over how to throw trash out?

115
00:06:51,623 --> 00:06:52,623
Last night...

116
00:06:52,623 --> 00:06:56,523
Rather, at about 3 am in the wee hours of the morning today.

117
00:06:56,523 --> 00:07:00,723
I got thirsty so I was drinking water in the kitchen.

118
00:07:00,723 --> 00:07:03,023
When I happened to look out the window

119
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,123
and notice someone taking trash out.

120
00:07:05,123 --> 00:07:06,623
I couldn't stand not doing anything so I...

121
00:07:06,623 --> 00:07:08,023
So, it's you again.

122
00:07:08,023 --> 00:07:10,423
I thought I told you that you shouldn't bring your trash out at night,

123
00:07:10,423 --> 00:07:11,423
just the other day too!

124
00:07:11,423 --> 00:07:13,723
I cautioned her then she said...

125
00:07:13,723 --> 00:07:16,323
Get off my back.

126
00:07:18,623 --> 00:07:21,123
Stop playing Mr. Goody-goody all by yourself!

127
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:24,223
She came at me with an iron pipe that was at her feet.

128
00:07:24,223 --> 00:07:26,423
I never liked you from before.

129
00:07:26,423 --> 00:07:28,123
I thought that I'd be killed

130
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:32,123
unless I took the iron pipe away from her so I...

131
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,623
Are you all right?

132
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,723
Hey...

133
00:07:40,723 --> 00:07:42,823
Oh, no...

134
00:07:42,823 --> 00:07:46,823
But he turned himself in to the police right after that.

135
00:07:46,823 --> 00:07:49,923
So, rather than a case of homicide...

136
00:07:49,923 --> 00:07:51,923
Right.

137
00:07:51,923 --> 00:07:54,323
I admit to have killed her.

138
00:07:54,323 --> 00:07:58,223
But, officer, I did so in self-defense.

139
00:07:58,223 --> 00:08:01,023
Yes! I'm sure he did it in self-defense!

140
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,123
If it's as Mr. Iwata says.

141
00:08:03,123 --> 00:08:05,323
Self-defense?

142
00:08:05,323 --> 00:08:08,723
What happens if he did it in self-defense?

143
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:11,623
He won't be charged for homicide, right?

144
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:13,423
He won't be charged?

145
00:08:13,423 --> 00:08:15,723
But, it happened after midnight so...

146
00:08:15,723 --> 00:08:19,823
We're looking for eye-witnesses too but so far nothing.

147
00:08:19,823 --> 00:08:21,723
In other words, it's difficult to prove

148
00:08:21,723 --> 00:08:24,623
that the victim actually suddenly attacked him

149
00:08:24,623 --> 00:08:26,523
with the iron pipe.

150
00:08:26,523 --> 00:08:28,123
You mean you suspect him?

151
00:08:28,123 --> 00:08:31,823
We can't just take his side of the story for fact.

152
00:08:31,823 --> 00:08:33,323
We've got to find something to back it up...

153
00:08:33,323 --> 00:08:36,523
He's a really serious person

154
00:08:36,523 --> 00:08:38,923
and not someone who would lie.

155
00:08:38,923 --> 00:08:40,123
Yes!

156
00:08:40,123 --> 00:08:41,223
I think so too.

157
00:08:41,223 --> 00:08:44,623
But if he really felt that his life was in danger,

158
00:08:44,623 --> 00:08:46,523
why didn't he flee?

159
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:48,623
That's the part that bothers me too...

160
00:08:48,623 --> 00:08:51,423
It's strange that a person who is carrying out justice

161
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:53,123
runs from a person who is doing something wrong!

162
00:08:53,123 --> 00:08:55,523
Logically I guess you could say so, but...

163
00:08:55,523 --> 00:08:57,823
It seems that the victim was always not too concerned

164
00:08:57,823 --> 00:08:59,423
about the rules of how trash should be thrown away.

165
00:08:59,423 --> 00:09:01,323
You mean the woman who passed away?

166
00:09:01,323 --> 00:09:04,823
Yes. Her name was Ms. Misa Katayama

167
00:09:04,823 --> 00:09:07,523
and she lived alone in that condominium.

168
00:09:07,523 --> 00:09:10,523
She worked as a hostess at a snack bar,

169
00:09:10,523 --> 00:09:13,323
so she always came home after midnight.

170
00:09:13,323 --> 00:09:14,523
She seems to have thrown her trash out at night

171
00:09:14,523 --> 00:09:17,423
because she used to be asleep in the morning.

172
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:20,823
The community committee leader also seems to have cautioned her before.

173
00:09:20,823 --> 00:09:25,423
Ms. Katayama, please adhere to the rules.

174
00:09:25,423 --> 00:09:28,323
Stop pestering me with your rules and regulations.

175
00:09:28,323 --> 00:09:30,523
I mean all the fuss about throwing away rubbish at night.

176
00:09:30,523 --> 00:09:32,223
If it bothers you so much, why don't you call the police

177
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:33,923
and get them to arrest me.

178
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,023
It seems that the community committee leader

179
00:09:38,023 --> 00:09:40,023
couldn't do anything about it either.

180
00:09:40,023 --> 00:09:43,323
That's when Mr. Iwata moved in

181
00:09:43,323 --> 00:09:45,923
and cautioned her repeatedly about trash

182
00:09:45,923 --> 00:09:50,623
that Ms. Misa Katayama seemed to dislike him.

183
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:54,923
So, it's exactly as Iwata had testified...

184
00:09:54,923 --> 00:09:55,923
Isn't this the result of a tragedy that occurred impulsively

185
00:09:55,923 --> 00:09:57,723
because a woman who doesn't give a hoot about rules

186
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:01,223
and a man who is hung up on rules,

187
00:10:01,223 --> 00:10:03,923
just happened to live in the same neighborhood?

188
00:10:03,923 --> 00:10:06,323
I wonder if that's what it was?

189
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:10,023
For now, the only foothold we have is his testimony.

190
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:12,423
I'll go check on his character

191
00:10:12,423 --> 00:10:14,923
to see if he is one we can trust or not.

192
00:10:14,923 --> 00:10:16,723
It seems it's only been three months

193
00:10:16,723 --> 00:10:18,923
since he moved to this apartment but...

194
00:10:18,923 --> 00:10:20,823
I'll check further back in the past.

195
00:10:20,823 --> 00:10:22,923
I'll go look for eye-witnesses.

196
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:28,623
If we can make apparent what a decent citizen Mr. Iwata really is,

197
00:10:28,623 --> 00:10:31,323
I'm sure his killing in self-defense will be proven!

198
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,223
If he really did it in self-defense.

199
00:10:35,223 --> 00:10:39,023
I guess they're going to come with me even if I tell them not to.

200
00:10:40,823 --> 00:10:42,923
Mr. Iwata's personality?

201
00:10:42,923 --> 00:10:45,723
For example, is he the type that lies?

202
00:10:45,723 --> 00:10:48,423
No way... Not Mr. Iwata.

203
00:10:48,423 --> 00:10:50,023
He would never lie.

204
00:10:50,023 --> 00:10:52,923
He's a decent citizen that isn't two-faced.

205
00:10:52,923 --> 00:10:55,723
See, it's just a waste of time, Officer Takagi.

206
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:57,423
Yeah...

207
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:01,223
Did he used to get into trouble with people for not following rules

208
00:11:01,223 --> 00:11:03,123
when he was living here too?

209
00:11:03,123 --> 00:11:05,123
He would never get into trouble with anyone

210
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:08,223
because he's a mild mannered person.

211
00:11:08,223 --> 00:11:09,923
Something's not right...

212
00:11:09,923 --> 00:11:11,823
Because when we saw him the other day,

213
00:11:11,823 --> 00:11:14,823
he was really worked up and shouting off the top of his lungs.

214
00:11:14,823 --> 00:11:15,823
Yes...

215
00:11:15,823 --> 00:11:17,523
I wonder if his personality changed

216
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:20,223
after he moved to that apartment?

217
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:23,023
Oh, I was really surprised when he moved out,

218
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:24,723
because it was so sudden...

219
00:11:24,723 --> 00:11:26,223
Sudden?

220
00:11:26,223 --> 00:11:30,123
Well, the rental agreement is renewed every two years

221
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:34,823
and he moved out almost right after he completed renewal procedures.

222
00:11:34,823 --> 00:11:35,823
What?

223
00:11:35,823 --> 00:11:40,023
In other words, Mr. Iwata was planning to go on living here

224
00:11:40,023 --> 00:11:41,723
but suddenly changed his mind

225
00:11:41,723 --> 00:11:45,323
and moved in to the apartment in Beika-cho?

226
00:11:45,323 --> 00:11:49,423
Did Mr. Iwata move into an apartment in Beika-cho?

227
00:11:49,423 --> 00:11:51,923
Yes, why do you ask?

228
00:11:51,923 --> 00:11:56,223
It's nothing. But to move from a condominium to an apartment...

229
00:11:56,223 --> 00:11:59,023
He didn't look like he was having money problems.

230
00:11:59,023 --> 00:12:02,023
And, it's more convenient to go to the research lab

231
00:12:02,023 --> 00:12:04,623
that he works at from here too.

232
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:08,223
Maybe something urgent came up three months ago

233
00:12:08,223 --> 00:12:10,723
that he had to move into that apartment.

234
00:12:10,723 --> 00:12:13,723
Yeah. There seems to be no other way to think of it.

235
00:12:13,723 --> 00:12:16,823
And because he moved there, the incident occurred.

236
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:18,723
Hey! Just what does that mean?

237
00:12:18,723 --> 00:12:20,723
Hey! What does it mean?

238
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:22,023
-Hey! -Hey!

239
00:12:22,023 --> 00:12:23,923
How should I know?

240
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:25,423
This case most likely is not something

241
00:12:25,423 --> 00:12:29,023
that occurred on the spur of the moment after all.

242
00:12:33,603 --> 00:12:34,603
"Sanko Precision Technology Research Institute"

243
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:37,103
Three months ago?

244
00:12:37,103 --> 00:12:41,503
Yes, do you know if something out of the ordinary came over Mr. Iwata?

245
00:12:41,503 --> 00:12:43,303
Three months ago...

246
00:12:44,603 --> 00:12:47,603
Oh, he's usually a very cheerful person,

247
00:12:47,603 --> 00:12:52,103
but he looked to be very troubled about something back then.

248
00:12:52,103 --> 00:12:53,303
I think it was after he went to pay homage

249
00:12:53,303 --> 00:12:54,703
to the grave of his acquaintance.

250
00:12:54,703 --> 00:12:56,003
Pay homage to the grave?

251
00:12:56,003 --> 00:12:59,403
Yes... It was the second anniversary of his benefactor's death

252
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,103
who took care of him when he was in school.

253
00:13:01,103 --> 00:13:02,603
Did he go to the grave

254
00:13:02,603 --> 00:13:04,603
before he moved in to the apartment he's living in now?

255
00:13:04,603 --> 00:13:08,203
Yes, I think he moved out soon after that.

256
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:12,503
That visit to the grave may have triggered him off in some way.

257
00:13:12,503 --> 00:13:14,503
A school days benefactor who he owes his life to...

258
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:18,103
"Inoue Law Office" -Oh, you must mean Mr. Yasaka.

259
00:13:18,103 --> 00:13:21,603
Iwata and I were both students who didn't have money

260
00:13:21,603 --> 00:13:24,103
so we worked part-time and barely fed ourselves.

261
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:29,303
Iwata used to work part time at Mr. Yasaka's factory.

262
00:13:29,303 --> 00:13:30,903
Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka took care of Iwata,

263
00:13:30,903 --> 00:13:33,603
who had lost his parents at a young age,

264
00:13:33,603 --> 00:13:36,903
as if he were their own son.

265
00:13:36,903 --> 00:13:39,403
When he was hit by a motorbike near the factory

266
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:41,903
and was badly hurt...

267
00:13:41,903 --> 00:13:44,803
If a blood transfusion is needed, please use my blood!

268
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:46,403
Mine too!

269
00:13:46,403 --> 00:13:49,403
The couple both seem to have given him blood.

270
00:13:49,403 --> 00:13:52,403
In other words, that couple saved his life.

271
00:13:52,403 --> 00:13:54,603
Iwata used to say so too.

272
00:13:54,603 --> 00:13:56,703
However, about two years ago,

273
00:13:56,703 --> 00:14:01,003
they were deceived by some bad loan shark

274
00:14:01,003 --> 00:14:03,003
who took away their house as well as their factory

275
00:14:03,003 --> 00:14:06,303
and the couple committed suicide.

276
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,703
If he said that he was going to visit the grave of someone

277
00:14:07,703 --> 00:14:09,503
who saved his life in his school days,

278
00:14:09,503 --> 00:14:12,903
it must be the grave of that couple.

279
00:14:12,903 --> 00:14:14,303
I'm sure the temple where their grave was is

280
00:14:14,303 --> 00:14:17,403
in Henryu Temple located in Beika-cho.

281
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:18,603
-What? -What?

282
00:14:18,603 --> 00:14:20,403
Henryu Temple...

283
00:14:20,403 --> 00:14:22,803
That's near your apartment, right, Chiharu?

284
00:14:22,803 --> 00:14:24,103
Yes...

285
00:14:24,103 --> 00:14:26,103
There's Beika Station...

286
00:14:26,103 --> 00:14:27,903
The apartment...

287
00:14:27,903 --> 00:14:29,603
And it's beyond a little way farther.

288
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,803
Where's the loan shark that deceived Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka

289
00:14:33,803 --> 00:14:36,303
and drove them to suicide now?

290
00:14:36,303 --> 00:14:38,503
I'm sure he's in jail

291
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,303
because he seems to have threatened people for money

292
00:14:40,303 --> 00:14:42,203
and been involved in other crimes.

293
00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:44,303
What about the woman?

294
00:14:44,303 --> 00:14:45,803
The woman?

295
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:48,603
There seems to have been a woman involved too.

296
00:14:48,603 --> 00:14:49,703
"Two Years Ago" -After investigating I found out

297
00:14:49,703 --> 00:14:52,903
that there was a woman who introduced the loan shark Fujikura

298
00:14:52,903 --> 00:14:55,203
to the Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka's!

299
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:58,103
I'm sure that the woman, conspired with Fujikura

300
00:14:58,103 --> 00:15:00,403
to begin with and deceived the Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka's.

301
00:15:00,403 --> 00:15:04,403
Hey, can't you somehow get that woman to pay for what she did too?

302
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,403
If she says that she introduced them out of goodwill,

303
00:15:06,403 --> 00:15:07,503
that's it...

304
00:15:07,503 --> 00:15:10,503
It's too bad, but there's no way she can be tried by law.

305
00:15:10,503 --> 00:15:14,003
So, you can't punish that woman by law!

306
00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:16,403
Iwata seemed really vexed.

307
00:15:16,403 --> 00:15:18,203
What's that woman's name?

308
00:15:18,203 --> 00:15:19,403
He didn't tell me.

309
00:15:19,403 --> 00:15:22,803
I think she was working for a bar or a snack shop or something.

310
00:15:22,803 --> 00:15:24,903
-Which means... -Don't tell me that...

311
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:27,103
What about that woman?

312
00:15:28,403 --> 00:15:29,903
So, that's the story.

313
00:15:30,703 --> 00:15:32,503
I have something I would like you

314
00:15:32,503 --> 00:15:35,303
to verify with a man called Fujikura

315
00:15:35,303 --> 00:15:38,903
who had been serving time since two years ago.

316
00:15:38,903 --> 00:15:40,903
You can't?

317
00:15:40,903 --> 00:15:43,303
He died last month of an illness?

318
00:15:45,303 --> 00:15:47,003
Fujikura?

319
00:15:47,003 --> 00:15:48,703
Eiji Fujikura.

320
00:15:48,703 --> 00:15:52,703
Have you ever heard this man's name from Ms. Misa Katayama?

321
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:54,403
No, I haven't.

322
00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:55,503
I don't have the slightest idea what kind of guy

323
00:15:55,503 --> 00:15:58,103
that nasty woman was going with...

324
00:15:58,103 --> 00:16:01,703
But you were working with her, weren't you...

325
00:16:01,703 --> 00:16:03,303
I'm telling you, I don't know!

326
00:16:13,303 --> 00:16:15,303
Yes, this is Takagi.

327
00:16:15,303 --> 00:16:16,803
Thank you just a while ago.

328
00:16:17,903 --> 00:16:19,403
You got verification?

329
00:16:19,403 --> 00:16:21,403
Thank you.

330
00:16:21,403 --> 00:16:23,503
It's the prison officer I called a while ago.

331
00:16:23,503 --> 00:16:27,503
He asked a person who was serving sentence together with Fujikura.

332
00:16:27,503 --> 00:16:29,403
It seems that Fujikura was saying that once he got out,

333
00:16:29,403 --> 00:16:31,803
he was going to team up with a hostess called Misa

334
00:16:31,803 --> 00:16:34,103
and make loads of cash again.

335
00:16:34,103 --> 00:16:37,003
The assaulter and the victim connected, didn't they?

336
00:16:37,003 --> 00:16:38,203
-Mitsuhiko. -Mitsuhiko.

337
00:16:38,203 --> 00:16:42,403
You have no conclusive proof at all yet!

338
00:16:42,403 --> 00:16:43,903
Proof...

339
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:49,003
Conan!

340
00:16:50,103 --> 00:16:51,803
What's with this kid?

341
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,103
-Conan! -Conan!

342
00:16:55,003 --> 00:16:58,303
Is she the person called Ms. Misa Katayama?

343
00:16:58,303 --> 00:17:01,503
Yes, but if so, what?

344
00:17:01,503 --> 00:17:03,703
Is this a recent picture?

345
00:17:03,703 --> 00:17:06,103
It's about a half a year ago...

346
00:17:06,103 --> 00:17:08,403
Half a year has already passed...

347
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:11,003
What about this picture?

348
00:17:11,003 --> 00:17:12,703
She's hurt.

349
00:17:14,803 --> 00:17:16,203
Yes, right.

350
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:18,403
She slammed her finger between the car door and it almost came off.

351
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:19,803
There sure was a great fuss over it.

352
00:17:19,803 --> 00:17:22,003
Everything turned out okay, for the time being though.

353
00:17:22,003 --> 00:17:23,503
For the time being?

354
00:17:25,803 --> 00:17:29,003
There's one thing I'd like to verify...

355
00:17:29,003 --> 00:17:32,803
Yes. That murder weapon that was confiscated as evidence.

356
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:35,203
Yes... About that iron pipe...

357
00:17:35,203 --> 00:17:38,603
Although we were trying to save Mr. Iwata,

358
00:17:38,603 --> 00:17:41,703
we seemed to have tracked down something incredible.

359
00:17:41,703 --> 00:17:43,103
-Mitsuhiko. -Mitsuhiko.

360
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,503
No matter what the consequences, there is only one truth.

361
00:17:47,703 --> 00:17:49,903
You understand why we asked you to come here,

362
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,403
don't you, Mr. Iwata?

363
00:17:54,503 --> 00:17:56,403
"Yasaka Family's Grave" -Three months ago from now,

364
00:17:56,403 --> 00:17:59,203
you came to visit this grave...

365
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,003
The day you came here was

366
00:18:01,003 --> 00:18:02,403
the memorial day of the death of Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka,

367
00:18:02,403 --> 00:18:04,803
who killed themselves after being deceived by Eiji Fujikura,

368
00:18:04,803 --> 00:18:07,303
an evil loan shark two years ago.

369
00:18:10,403 --> 00:18:12,303
Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka...

370
00:18:12,303 --> 00:18:15,603
On your way back to the station after visiting the grave,

371
00:18:15,603 --> 00:18:19,103
you coincidentally caught a glimpse of something.

372
00:18:19,103 --> 00:18:21,403
It was the woman who had conspired with Eiji Fujikura

373
00:18:21,403 --> 00:18:24,303
and deceived the Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka's.

374
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,803
Stop pestering me with your rules and regulations.

375
00:18:26,803 --> 00:18:29,003
If it bothers you so much, why don't you call the police

376
00:18:29,003 --> 00:18:32,803
and get them to arrest me?

377
00:18:35,003 --> 00:18:38,003
Despite having driven a good couple to their death,

378
00:18:38,003 --> 00:18:41,603
this woman didn't show a tinge of regret.

379
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:44,803
Isn't that when you thought that having seen her

380
00:18:44,803 --> 00:18:47,703
on their memorial day was a work of fate?

381
00:18:47,703 --> 00:18:50,703
And that you would avenge the death of the couple who saved you.

382
00:18:52,303 --> 00:18:54,403
You rented the apartment located opposite the condominium

383
00:18:54,403 --> 00:18:57,503
that the woman lived and moved in.

384
00:18:59,603 --> 00:19:02,403
You wanted to avenge their death but didn't want to get caught doing so.

385
00:19:02,403 --> 00:19:05,203
Since she was not legally punished by law,

386
00:19:05,203 --> 00:19:07,403
you thought up a scheme in which you wouldn't get caught either.

387
00:19:07,403 --> 00:19:11,603
So, you thought up the strategy of killing in self-defense.

388
00:19:11,603 --> 00:19:15,303
You carried out your plan right away.

389
00:19:15,303 --> 00:19:17,503
You stared the arson fear.

390
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:19,103
Using this as a start,

391
00:19:19,103 --> 00:19:21,803
you made everybody believe that you had very strict standards

392
00:19:21,803 --> 00:19:23,803
when it came to throwing out trash.

393
00:19:23,803 --> 00:19:26,303
Next, all you had to do was to wait for the chance to come around.

394
00:19:26,303 --> 00:19:29,103
You continued to wait until that woman,

395
00:19:29,103 --> 00:19:31,703
Ms. Misa Katayama, to come out to throw her trash away.

396
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:35,903
You waited for the perfect chance when there were no witnesses at all.

397
00:19:35,903 --> 00:19:37,003
Oh...

398
00:19:39,103 --> 00:19:40,203
Darn!

399
00:19:40,203 --> 00:19:43,703
Then last night the time finally arrived.

400
00:19:55,303 --> 00:19:57,803
You put her fingerprints on the iron pipe

401
00:19:57,803 --> 00:20:00,103
that you brought along with you

402
00:20:00,103 --> 00:20:03,203
and turned yourself into the police.

403
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,403
Am I wrong, Mr. Iwata?

404
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:09,703
You tried to make a planned murder looks as if it happened by chance.

405
00:20:09,703 --> 00:20:13,703
Since it looks on the outside to be trouble between the neighbors,

406
00:20:13,703 --> 00:20:17,403
you probably thought that police wouldn't check far back

407
00:20:17,403 --> 00:20:20,303
into the past karmic relationship of the victim and assaulter.

408
00:20:21,903 --> 00:20:25,303
That woman picked the iron pipe up from the ground

409
00:20:25,303 --> 00:20:27,603
and suddenly attacked me.

410
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:30,303
That's why I had no choice but to...

411
00:20:30,303 --> 00:20:32,603
I did it in self-defense!

412
00:20:32,603 --> 00:20:33,803
Enough already.

413
00:20:33,803 --> 00:20:34,903
Yeah.

414
00:20:34,903 --> 00:20:36,603
Please stop it already.

415
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:38,303
We have proof.

416
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,503
It's Ms. Misa Katayama's fingerprints.

417
00:20:40,503 --> 00:20:42,103
Fingerprints?

418
00:20:42,103 --> 00:20:44,103
Are you saying that the woman's fingerprints weren't

419
00:20:44,103 --> 00:20:45,903
on the iron pipe or what?

420
00:20:45,903 --> 00:20:47,403
Just the opposite.

421
00:20:47,403 --> 00:20:51,503
The fingerprint of all 10 of Ms. Katayama's fingers were on it.

422
00:20:52,603 --> 00:20:54,703
That person called, Ms. Misa Katayama,

423
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:56,603
seems to have hurt the finger of her right hand very badly

424
00:20:56,603 --> 00:20:58,203
half a year ago

425
00:20:58,203 --> 00:21:01,603
and to this day cannot bend that finger.

426
00:21:01,603 --> 00:21:02,803
What?

427
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,803
Unless somebody forced her to grab the pole

428
00:21:04,803 --> 00:21:06,403
and held it down,

429
00:21:06,403 --> 00:21:09,903
the fingerprint of that finger couldn't have got onto the pole.

430
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:18,703
I just couldn't forgive that woman!

431
00:21:20,003 --> 00:21:22,103
I'm alive here today thanks

432
00:21:22,103 --> 00:21:24,203
to the Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka's giving me blood.

433
00:21:24,203 --> 00:21:27,403
Hey, keep your eyes on what you're doing or you'll get hurt.

434
00:21:27,403 --> 00:21:28,503
Okay!

435
00:21:28,503 --> 00:21:32,603
I think I'll work here even after graduating from university...

436
00:21:32,603 --> 00:21:34,203
Don't be silly!

437
00:21:34,203 --> 00:21:36,003
That's right, Iwata.

438
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,703
You're going to become a technician great enough

439
00:21:37,703 --> 00:21:39,703
to carry Japan on your shoulders.

440
00:21:39,703 --> 00:21:42,903
You idiot, not only Japan but the world!

441
00:21:42,903 --> 00:21:44,003
Right!

442
00:21:45,703 --> 00:21:48,803
How could she dare to deceive such a good couple...

443
00:21:48,803 --> 00:21:53,303
And to go as far as to drive them to commit suicide...

444
00:21:53,303 --> 00:21:56,403
Regardless, what you have committed is a crime.

445
00:21:56,403 --> 00:21:58,703
No matter how much you cannot forgive a person,

446
00:21:58,703 --> 00:22:01,703
it does not give you the right to take that person's life.

447
00:22:03,603 --> 00:22:04,903
Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka!

448
00:23:43,603 --> 00:23:45,603
Oh, there you are!

449
00:23:45,603 --> 00:23:47,703
What's up, Genta?

450
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:52,703
A super weirdo moved in right opposite our house,

451
00:23:52,703 --> 00:23:54,903
and that person is...

452
00:23:56,703 --> 00:23:57,903
What's the matter?

453
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,703
He never learns...

454
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,400
Next Conan's Hint:

455
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,500
"The face of dice"

456
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,460
Do dice have a face?

457
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,540
-Yes, six of them too! -No joke?

458
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,860
Are you all right?
