Really! This place is bustling with the cherry blossom festival too,

22
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,120
so I'm glad we came here!

23
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,430
Yep, thanks, Ran!

24
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,830
Shouldn't you be thanking Detective Kogoro Mouri here,

25
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,430
who suddenly gets a call from a high school student from Osaka

26
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,330
saying that she wants to go flower viewing

27
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,940
and speeds her over here from early in the morning

28
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,340
to grant her wish, huh?

29
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,940
-Yes. -I know!

30
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,750
Well, there seems to be people who rather than feel gratitude

31
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,150
prefer bread to the song of birds though.

32
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,550
Oh boy, I mean Heiji's the one who wanted to go flower viewing.

33
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,420
Hey, Kazuha!

34
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,120
This pinwheel is cute!

35
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,830
Really! I'm going to buy one.

36
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,330
How much, sir?

37
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,530
200 yen.

38
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,330
Oh, one for me too.

39
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,450
Hey, what're you doing standing there doing nothing!

40
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,150
You called me over because you wanted something, right?

41
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,350
Oh, yeah.

42
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,320
Something about a high school student wearing glasses.

43
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,230
Oh, right, Eisuke Hondo.

44
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,730
He's a junior in high school and is Ran's classmate.

45
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,930
I wonder if you could check on something for me.

46
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,230
Huh? Why me?

47
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,640
Does he have something to do with Osaka?

48
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,140
No, the one I want you to check on

49
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,240
is the one whose eyes resemble that of this Eisuke Hondo guy

50
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,140
and is a member of the Black Organization

51
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,350
Rena Mizunashi!

52
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:38,950
Mizunashi is an announcer for Nichiuri TV, isn't she?

53
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,450
She seems to be on leave right now,

54
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,420
but you mean she's a bad person?

55
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,720
Hattori!

56
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,430
You're talking too loud! Hey!

57
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,330
She's on leave because she got into an accident

58
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,730
during a chase with the F.B.I. and was hurt badly.

59
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,740
She's in a certain hospital right now and lying unconscious there.

60
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,340
And?

61
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,640
The more so, then why me?

62
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,240
If you want somebody to check, why not ask that thin,

63
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,850
what was his name? Officer Takagi.

64
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,250
A picture.

65
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,250
The picture of a woman who looks exactly like Rena Mizunashi

66
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,220
was coincidentally taken 10 years ago

67
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,220
seems to have been uploaded on a website for some time.

68
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,830
The woman was standing in front of Tsutenkaku,

69
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,630
carrying a convenience store shopping bag!

70
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,030
Which means that the woman was living in Osaka?

71
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,230
I can't come to any conclusion yet

72
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,340
but I tried contacting the TV station to confirm thing with her.

73
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,440
However, a few days after I wrote,

74
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,140
the website was closed.

75
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,850
Something's fishy, don't you think?

76
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,450
That's why I want you to hurry and check things out for me.

77
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,650
Make sure Eisuke Hondo

78
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,950
who's sniffing around about her doesn't beat you to it!

79
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,220
If so, wouldn't it be faster for you

80
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:56,130
to nab that Hondo guy and make him spit it out?

81
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,730
If those two look alike, they may be blood related,

82
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,730
and she may be a villain too.

83
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,340
No, I don't think they're family.

84
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,340
I can't help feeling that

85
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,940
something about the way Eisuke Hondo acts is strange.

86
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,840
How do you do, Detective Mouri?

87
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,640
It's an honor to get to see you!

88
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,350
See! Just like there was no scratch there to begin with!

89
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:23,620
A new student who suddenly transferred and came to Ran's high school.

90
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,420
Which means that Rena Mizunashi whose eyes resemble his is...

91
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,030
Yeah, a member of the Black Organization.

92
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,330
They probably changed the face of one of their members

93
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,530
with plastic surgery to one of Eisuke Hondo's family

94
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:38,240
and became that person, quite an easy feat for them to accomplish.

95
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,240
At any rate, please have Inspector Ohtaki

96
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,140
check carefully and in secret

97
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,740
whether there was a woman named Mizunashi or Hondo

98
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,350
living in Osaka or not.

99
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,750
I see. If that woman really existed

100
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,720
and a case of a woman suddenly disappearing is found, it's bingo.

101
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,820
It really disappeared!

102
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,030
Just as if she was spirited away!

103
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,630
It's probably some work of fate that I ran into you here.

104
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,830
Please, I beg you.

105
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,030
Will you please solve the mystery of this case?

106
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,540
-Well... -What?

107
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,140
What's the matter, Pops?

108
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,140
This monk suddenly...

109
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,240
What? A person disappeared?

110
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,850
Yes. I'm a disciple at that temple, my name is Denkyu.

111
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:29,820
A person who came to visit the head monk the other day

112
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,120
suddenly disappeared from the room.

113
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,330
Suddenly?

114
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:39,530
She was a woman with long hair,

115
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,030
and spent the night at the annex.

116
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:45,840
But, when I went to tell her that breakfast was ready...

117
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,740
She was gone?

118
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,740
Maybe she decided to go home before eating breakfast?

119
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:55,150
No, she was actually in the room at that time

120
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,950
but I found her stabbed in the stomach with a knife,

121
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,050
dead and lying on the floor.

122
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,620
-What? -Are you saying that she was dead?

123
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,120
Yes.

124
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,520
Did you report it to the police?

125
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,620
Of course,

126
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,230
right after I let the head monk who was resting at the temple know.

127
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,630
Then, don't tell me that the one who disappeared is...

128
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,630
Yes, when the police came and arrived at the annex,

129
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,440
only the head monk was in the room.

130
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,040
There were no signs of the woman

131
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,040
nor the blood stain that was on the tatami.

132
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,050
No...

133
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,150
And, what did the head monk say?

134
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:34,250
That the visitor left early in the morning,

135
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,420
and that maybe I was dreaming.

136
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,720
Are you sure you really weren't still half asleep?

137
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,330
No way. I really saw it with my own eyes!

138
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:46,830
Okay, if you insist, let's go to the temple

139
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,730
and hear what the head monk has to say, then.

140
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,840
You're that famous Detective Kogoro Mouri.

141
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,540
"Shakuren" -What brings a famed person like you

142
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,540
"A Buddhist priest" -all the way up

143
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,350
to a small mountain temple like this?

144
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,350
Well, you see, Denkyu, a disciple of your temple...

145
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,550
Oh...

146
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:10,320
You want to know about that dream story of Denkyu

147
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,020
about the visitor who came here and disappeared out of the blue?

148
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,530
Well, sort of...

149
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:19,530
Well, to be honest, we just came to check things out.

150
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,530
To confirm whether what this monk saw was just an illusion

151
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:27,640
or whether you cleaned the corpse and everything up

152
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,740
before the police got here.

153
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,340
Heiji!

154
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:37,050
You have quite an interesting point of view, young man.

155
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,450
All right, let me take you over to the annex in question.

156
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:49,530
To the room that Denkyu insists swallowed up one whole person.

157
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:58,140
It sure takes a while to get to that annex, doesn't it?

158
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,940
Wow! The temple looks to be so far away already.

159
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,540
You can say that again!

160
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,340
There it is.

161
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,050
That's it.

162
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,650
It sure is an old looking building.

163
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:14,950
Yes, it's already been 50 years since it was built.

164
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,020
Please do come in.

165
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:26,030
One room is 8-mats and there are 4 room all together.

166
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,430
And, where's the place that woman's body was found?

167
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,840
Right around there to the upper right of this room.

168
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,740
-Well? -Nothing.

169
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,040
It's not a reversible mat either.

170
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,650
Oh, a statue of Buddha.

171
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,150
Guardians of the temple?

172
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:50,120
That's one of the Four Heavenly Kings, Tamonten.

173
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,220
This room facing north is called Tamonten.

174
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,630
To the west is Koumokuten,

175
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,930
the south Zoujyoten

176
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,130
and the east Jikokuten.

177
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,630
A Buddhist statue is inside each of the rooms.

178
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,440
Oh, you may touch it but please don't scratch it.

179
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,040
After all, the Buddhist statues are precious statues

180
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,140
that have been handed down to Shokakuji from one generation to the next.

181
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,340
Oh, is that right?

182
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,150
Well, it's already late today.

183
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:20,450
I suggest that you spend the night here tonight,

184
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:23,220
and start investigations tomorrow at dawn?

185
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,520
That is, only if you feel that you have more to check on.

186
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,130
Oh...

187
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,930
Are you serious about spending the night here at this temple?

188
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,830
I'm sure that it's only that the monk was half awake

189
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,530
and made a mistake!

190
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:40,040
That's right, so let's all head back to Ran's place.

191
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,040
It's you.

192
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,650
This time, in the middle of the room of the annex...

193
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,450
There's a woman with a knife stabbed through her stomach!

194
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,520
Is it in the same room?

195
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,020
Yes. Exactly the same as back then.

196
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,630
There's nobody here?

197
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,130
It can't be.

198
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,530
It was here for sure a while ago.

199
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,340
I guess I'll have to tell you about it after all.

200
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,040
Osho!

201
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,840
The fact is, there was no visitor at this temple on that day.

202
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,550
I've got to also so add that you were just chasing

203
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,850
the shadow of your mother who passed on long ago.

204
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,450
Oh, no...

205
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,020
No.

206
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,050
"Red. Disappeared Bloodstain" -I saw it with my very eyes.

207
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,350
"Red. Disappeared Bloodstain" -I'm trying to tell you that

208
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:50,960
it's all an illusion you imagined because you miss your mother.

209
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,260
It can't be...

210
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,960
Your poor mother who threw herself in the ocean

211
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,570
after bringing you here to this temple, and placing you in my custody.

212
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,770
In your custody?

213
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,370
Yes, Denkyu here is an abandoned child,

214
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,570
whom I, who had just become the head priest of this temple

215
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,780
adopted and brought up for 18 years.

216
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,350
I'm not good at refusing

217
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,250
and have ended up raising 2 or 3 others too.

218
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,650
But, it seems that they didn't like it here and left,

219
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,360
so only Denkyu and I are at this temple now.

220
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,860
Even after being apart so long,

221
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,260
Denkyu can't forget about his dear mother.

222
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,560
Which means that just like you say,

223
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,570
the dead body of the woman Denkyu says he saw the other day was...

224
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:33,970
Right, we didn't even have visitors that day.

225
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,270
However, three days ago, that morning,

226
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:40,280
Denkyu ran in here looking pale.

227
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,340
I thought that maybe someone who got lost in the mountains

228
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,450
came uninvited to this annex

229
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,850
and came here to check.

230
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,550
But, just like tonight, there was no one here.

231
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:55,160
Yes, I felt sorry for Denkyu who insisted on seeing such an illusion that

232
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,160
when the police came,

233
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,860
I went along with his story without thinking,

234
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,770
saying that a woman visitor came here early in the morning.

235
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,670
So, now has the mystery been solved?

236
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,270
Well, sort of.

237
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,870
No.

238
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:14,380
I'm sure the woman was here in this room

239
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,350
at least three days ago, when Denkyu said he saw her.

240
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,650
Do you or Denkyu like to dress yourselves in woman's clothes?

241
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,250
Woman's clothes?

242
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,860
You! What stupid thing are you talking about?

243
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,560
Look what I found.

244
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,060
See!

245
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,860
This is the back catch of a pierced earring?

246
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,360
When we were checking to see

247
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,170
if the tatami of this room was double matted

248
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,370
and flipped it over,

249
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,570
this kid found it.

250
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,270
The back catch of pierced earrings easily come off

251
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,080
so it probably came off accidentally

252
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,750
and got stuck in between the tatami

253
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,750
but the problem is, whose pierce it is?

254
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,650
We've got to track down who the owner of this pierce back catch

255
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:00,660
that is still shiny as if it hasn't been here for long after it came off.

256
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,160
Come to think of it.

257
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,760
The woman that came three days ago also

258
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,660
wore pierced earrings!

259
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,160
Then, the answers simple!

260
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,870
The one who Denkyu saw was not an illusion.

261
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,170
No.

262
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,570
The one who was wearing the earring

263
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,070
was probably either Bunkyu or Rinkyu

264
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:22,140
who were disciples here at this temple until two months ago.

265
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,050
Bunkyu and Rinkyu?

266
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,550
Remember, I mentioned a while ago that

267
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:30,450
I adopted two other children besides Denkyu.

268
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:34,960
Unlike Denkyu, they were both forever prone to mischief.

269
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,860
They used to sneak out of the temple night after night and go to town.

270
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,060
Moreover, they used to disguise themselves as women

271
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,560
so people wouldn't suspect them to be monks.

272
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,970
Disguise?

273
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,170
Yes. I don't know where they got a hold of it

274
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,070
but they wore a wig, pierced earrings and a long dress,

275
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:53,580
just like those the young people wear nowadays.

276
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,180
Is that true?

277
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,750
Yes.

278
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,550
Those two used to frequently drink liquor

279
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,050
secretly in this annex too.

280
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:04,250
Osho found out about it, and the two had a good scolding.

281
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:09,260
They didn't like it, so they both left this temple together.

282
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,660
They seem to have been using this annex to change clothes and all,

283
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,870
so the backing must've accidentally come off.

284
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,770
So, that's the story! Convinced?

285
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:24,870
You still don't look convinced, I see.

286
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:28,380
Then do check things out for yourselves to your heart's content.

287
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,650
If as Denkyu says

288
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,150
there was a blood smeared corpse in the middle of the room,

289
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:37,750
the blood should be found somewhere on the tatami.

290
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,260
Ran.

291
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,960
Don't you think Heiji and the others are a bit late?

292
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,560
Yeah, I wonder if something happened.

293
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,070
Okay, Ran, wait here then! I'll go check!

294
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,270
Oh, I'll go too, then!

295
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,440
Don't you think that it's better for us

296
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,450
to just wait here without moving after all, Ran?

297
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,650
I guess so.

298
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:34,180
Around where on the floor was that woman?

299
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,550
Oh, yes. She was right around here three days ago,

300
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,350
lying on the floor like this.

301
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,550
Then, what about the woman you saw a while ago?

302
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,650
In the middle of the room,

303
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,160
like so.

304
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,560
Was there a lot of blood?

305
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,860
Yeah.

306
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,760
Three days ago as well as tonight,

307
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,560
there was a lot of bleeding from the stomach.

308
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,170
Then, 10 to 1 it's not possible.

309
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,670
Maybe possible with the corpse he saw yesterday.

310
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:06,070
But if the corpse he saw lying there just a while ago is real,

311
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,950
there should be a blood stained tatami on the side

312
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:13,950
but even looks around now, there's no such tatami around!

313
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,450
You think so too. Did I actually see

314
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:20,860
an illusion of my mother that never existed in the first place after all?

315
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,060
So, are you convinced now?

316
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,960
Yes, very.

317
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,170
Then, Denkyu, please show these people to the gate.

318
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,170
Yes, sir.

319
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,170
I'll stay here in this room for a while

320
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,070
and offer prayer to the Four Heavenly Kings

321
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:40,080
in apology of having been a bit of a nuisance with all the fuss here.

322
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:45,750
I'm sorry for keeping you here for so long because of my mistake.

323
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,250
No, don't be, but why were you there at that time in that annex?

324
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,050
I always go and check to see

325
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,760
if the doors are locked before dinner.

326
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,860
Bunkyu and Rinkyu

327
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:02,970
were actually in charge of cleaning and locking the annex up.

328
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,770
But, after their drinking incident,

329
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:09,070
Osho did the cleaning and I was in charge of locking up.

330
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,070
Not only did they drink liquor,

331
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,880
but I'll be the two were also smoking in there too?

332
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,840
How do you know?

333
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,450
They both said they succeeded in smoking secretly.

334
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,050
What a conspicuous secret.

335
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,650
There was an obviously burnt spot on the tatami.

336
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,760
Come to think of it, there were remains of spilt beer too.

337
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,760
Yeah but what I don't understand is why both the remains...

338
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,470
They weren't there when we checked at sundown today.

339
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,470
Right, Heiji?

340
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,370
-Right! -Don't tell me that

341
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,470
someone switched the tatami?

342
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:46,070
I'm just saying that it's possible.

343
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,680
No way.

344
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,250
I'm sure you guys already know if you checked too,

345
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,950
but the tatami at the annex was not double-sided,

346
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,950
and besides, it was old and discolored from the sun.

347
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,350
Even if a tatami from someplace else

348
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,160
were to have been brought in and replaced,

349
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,760
the discoloration would make it apparent.

350
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,760
You mean switching isn't possible?

351
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,770
Switching the tatami of one of the four 8-mat floors.

352
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,670
To go from Pop's car to that annex

353
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,170
would take 7 to 8 minutes going and coming back,

354
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:18,170
if you run, that's enough time to switch the tatami!

355
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,080
Come to think of it, something always felt different from usual,

356
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,840
each time I found the bodies.

357
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,350
Right? I'll bet

358
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,650
the direction the tatami is placed or something is different?

359
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,550
Oh, but it's only that I have this feeling.

360
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,950
No matter how you replace the tatami,

361
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,260
you can't hide the blood stain.

362
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,160
If the body was lying smeared with blood in the middle of the room,

363
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,760
there should be blood on more than two tatamis!

364
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,060
Well, the only thing that did look suspicious

365
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,970
were the statues of the Four Heavenly Kings in the corner of the rooms

366
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,570
but they were inside transparent glass cases.

367
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:52,370
When the statue was moved, the tatami under it was in view,

368
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,680
so the blood couldn't have been hidden.

369
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,750
Let's pull out, pull out!

370
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,250
I can't be wasting my time on this silly story!

371
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,950
Huh? A mistake?

372
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,960
Are you saying that there was no corpse?

373
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,760
No, it was this monk's illusion.

374
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,060
I'm sorry.

375
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,460
But, I'm glad that nobody was dead then.

376
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,570
Okay, hurry and get in then, so we can head back to Ran's house.

377
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,670
The pinwheel.

378
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,470
Oh no, I squashed it.

379
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,170
It's okay, because it's not all that bent out of shape.

380
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,580
Why?

381
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,240
Why did the burnt remain that wasn't there at sundown

382
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,050
appear suddenly at night?

383
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,050
It was hidden out of sight?

384
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,750
But, where?

385
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,060
Heiji...

386
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,160
Hey, you...

387
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,870
This is it! This!

388
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:57,470
I've figured out where the blood stain is hidden!

389
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,680
Yeah, I thought of that too!

390
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,480
Yeah,

391
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,450
completely!

392
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,020
"Orange. Pinwheel Room" -I've figured it out completely!

393
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,170
"Orange. Pinwheel Room" -You meant that the woman

394
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,440
that I saw three days ago and the one I saw tonight were...

395
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,840
Yeah, not an illusion but genuine dead bodies

396
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,140
that were ingeniously hidden and made to look as if they disappeared

397
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,550
using an unimaginable trick.

398
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,750
Trick?

399
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,050
What kind of trick was it?

400
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,750
Please tell us, dad!

401
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:36,860
The hint is this pinwheel! This brought everything to light!

402
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,860
You thought so too, didn't you?

403
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,460
Osaka kid.

404
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,960
Yeah.

405
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,160
Why did the corpse disappear

406
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,870
when Denkyu took us to the annex with him and returned?

407
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,640
Let's say that this pinwheel is the annex.

408
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,340
There is no railing at the annex

409
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,940
and there are four square 8-mat rooms.

410
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,740
Railing?

411
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,150
Square?

412
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:02,050
Oh my, you mean the third-rate detective kid of Osaka

413
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,450
can't figure it out yet?

414
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,850
No, I can't make out your deduction.

415
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:12,360
Yes. It rotated 180 degrees, that annex!

416
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,970
I don't think there's such a contraption in that annex.

417
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,770
You just don't know of it.

418
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:23,640
I hear that the annex was built 50 years ago.

419
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,140
Even so,

420
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,240
three days ago the police, and tonight you people,

421
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,940
who were called by me, after coming here

422
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,950
investigated every nook and cranny, of all four rooms, didn't you?

423
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:34,950
Back then,

424
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:38,350
no blood nor corpse was found in any of the rooms, right?

425
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,150
Yeah, that's right.

426
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,550
Besides,

427
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:45,160
if such an amusement park like building existed 50 years ago,

428
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:50,760
it would've become a famous site around here. Dumb-dumb!

429
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,370
Then...

430
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:57,040
There was no dead body so it was just your illusion!

431
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,940
No, there was blood as well as the corpse.

432
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,740
Although they were hidden and out of sight.

433
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,250
Hidden... where on earth?

434
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,350
Ouch.

435
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,050
Conan!

436
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,560
Are you all right?

437
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,960
I slipped when I tried to pick up the badge I dropped.

438
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,860
You've gotta be careful.

439
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,060
It seems to be quite muddy around here yet

440
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,960
from the rain this morning.

441
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,870
By the way, do you see my detective badge

442
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:29,440
somewhere around here?

443
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,040
No, I don't see it.

444
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,940
Here's your glasses.

445
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,540
Thank you!

446
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,140
There's your badge.

447
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,240
Oh, yeah.

448
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,050
But, how strange... it wasn't there a while ago.

449
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,450
That's true.

450
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:47,450
Maybe it's because of the leaf that's stuck on this glasses.

451
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:51,160
See, you can see the badge if it's like this

452
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,860
but, if you put the glasses with the leaf on it like this,

453
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,960
you can't see it anymore.

454
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,970
Really. It's mixed up with the leaves on the ground.

455
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,440
And it looks like there's no badge there.

456
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,640
Hey, maybe the same sort of trick was used?

457
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,840
Could be.

458
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,640
A trick?

459
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,350
Yeah, if this trick is used,

460
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,450
maybe even blood can be hidden.

461
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,850
Under the case of the statues of the Four Heavenly Kings

462
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:20,750
that were in the corner of the rooms of the annex.

463
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,560
There was nothing below the cases.

464
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,560
The tatami below was in view under the case

465
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,260
when I moved the statue too.

466
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,460
So if you cut the tatami

467
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,460
and paste the front side of the tatami onto the back of the glass case

468
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,070
and if it were placed on top of the tatami where the blood stain is...

469
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,440
The blood would be completely covered

470
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,940
and it would look as if you're looking at the tatami below

471
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,940
through the glass case, wouldn't it?

472
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,540
True.

473
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,650
But, the trick would give itself away

474
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,450
as soon as somebody lifts the case up, right?

475
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:48,950
No way.

476
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,850
If you lift the glass case with the statue inside it,

477
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:55,860
it may fall and crack the glass,

478
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,060
besides if you move the statue that's inside,

479
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,960
it looks as if the tatami below is in view through the glass.

480
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,460
Nobody would think of going out of the way

481
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,460
to move the case after doing so!

482
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,770
I didn't move the case myself either.

483
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:11,640
But, who for what reason would've set up a trick like that?

484
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,540
Would the killer do something like that to hide the blood?

485
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,850
The ones who set up this trick

486
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:22,350
were probably the two monks who left this temple two months ago,

487
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,850
in order to hide the liquor stains

488
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,550
and burnt remains from their cigarettes.

489
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,450
They probably went out to look for tatami

490
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:29,960
that was very close in color to the one in the annex

491
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,460
and pasted it on to the bottom of the glass case of the statue,

492
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:37,160
to hide the stain and remains of burns.

493
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,970
Those two were in charge of cleaning the annex,

494
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,140
and besides they told you that they succeeded

495
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,740
in pulling the trick, right?

496
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,240
Yes.

497
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,140
When we checked the annex at sundown,

498
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,440
we found nothing like that and yet,

499
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,350
when you came and told us you found the corpse

500
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,350
and we went to check,

501
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,950
it suddenly appeared, that's the proof.

502
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,250
Then, you mean

503
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:01,450
the two monks who left snuck back in here

504
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:04,860
and killed a woman from somewhere?

505
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:08,360
No. The two just set up the trick.

506
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,960
The one who used it

507
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,360
is the one who saw through their trick

508
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,170
and bawled the two out.

509
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,340
That is, no one else could've done it

510
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,640
besides head monk Shakuren, right?

511
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,340
You mean that Osho did it?

512
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,240
You mean he killed the woman?

513
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,640
No.

514
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,950
If he killed somebody, he wouldn't have returned to the temple

515
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,450
and sleep like nothing happened

516
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,050
till Denkyu found the corpse three days ago.

517
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:34,650
That woman most probably committed suicide.

518
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:38,460
Osho, who heard from Denkyu that a woman was dead in the annex,

519
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,960
probably came up with the idea on the spur of the moment.

520
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,960
He decided to say that it was Denkyu's illusion

521
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,170
and that there was no dead body to begin with!

522
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,670
Oh, no...

523
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:51,440
Since the blood of the woman that was smeared on the tatami

524
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,140
was in just about the same place

525
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,940
as the stains of the liquor and cigarette,

526
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,040
he probably used the trick of the case to hide them,

527
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,350
and moved the tatami,

528
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,050
which after he place the case over it!

529
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:04,150
Then, where's that dead body?

530
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:07,250
Probably hidden under the porch of the annex or something,

531
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:09,060
until the police left.

532
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,460
So, the woman I saw tonight

533
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,160
-is the woman from three days ago... -No.

534
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,160
I think that the corpse you saw tonight was probably

535
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,470
Osho dressed in a woman's outfit lying on the floor.

536
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,170
Osho?

537
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:26,440
Yeah, using the wig that the other two monks used to wear.

538
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,840
He probably used ketchup or something

539
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,840
and made it look as if he was stabbed in the stomach with a knife.

540
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,850
He did so to make us as well as Denkyu

541
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:40,450
believe that the dead body of the woman was just an illusion.

542
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,260
But, isn't it strange?

543
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,360
The statues in the annex were all placed

544
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,260
in the corner of the four rooms

545
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,360
on the upper right and lower left corner.

546
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,170
The two monks that set up the trick

547
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:56,940
hid the cigarette burn and liquor stain, that's two places.

548
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,840
Even if the blood from the corpse three days

549
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,940
just happened to conveniently be in that position,

550
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,740
the corpse that Denkyu saw tonight, covered with blood

551
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,350
was lying in the middle of the room.

552
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:09,650
Which adds up to four blood-stained places.

553
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,250
With only two cases, I don't think

554
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,250
he could've hidden the blood stain that was smeared on today.

555
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:18,260
No, it's not two. There're four cases.

556
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,860
Osho probably copied the two other monks

557
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,760
and rigged the remaining two cases in the same way.

558
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,270
Therefore, he had four places he could use to hide the stains.

559
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,570
So, today he put ketchup that looked to be blood

560
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,840
on a total of four mats-the two mats

561
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,140
that originally had blood stains on them

562
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,440
and two other brand new ones that he acquired,

563
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,840
dressed in a woman's outfit and lay down on the middle of the room.

564
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,150
He waited for Denkyu to come lock the doors.

565
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,850
He knew that Denkyu would panic and come get us,

566
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:43,350
so within that time Osho replaced the blood stained tatamis back

567
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,850
in the four corners.

568
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:47,450
He then appeared looking as if nothing happened from behind us,

569
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,760
who arrived at the annex!

570
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,360
Like I've been trying to say,

571
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,360
if Osho was lying in the middle of the room

572
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,360
pretending to be the corpse,

573
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,470
the blood-like stain wouldn't be on the corner of the tatami,

574
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,140
but elsewhere, right?

575
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,140
If so, wouldn't it be difficult to hide everything right

576
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,140
even if there were to be four cases?

577
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,240
Really? Can you really be sure?

578
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,940
Oh, I see!

579
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,550
All he had to do was switch the tatami

580
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:17,150
so that the blood stained part comes at the corner of the tatami!

581
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,550
But this way, the location of the blood,

582
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:23,260
although the upper right and lower left is the same,

583
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,460
the remaining two would be to the upper left and lower right.

584
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,660
So, it won't do.

585
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,060
Oh, maybe it's this way?

586
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,870
This way, the two on the upper right are okay,

587
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:37,440
but two are on the upper left.

588
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,740
So, he couldn't have just put the Buddhist statues

589
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,750
in the four corners of the rooms to hide the blood stains, could he?

590
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,950
Are you sure those other the only ways you can line them up?

591
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:52,150
Take a look at this.

592
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,350
Huh?

593
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:56,860
It's just like a pinwheel, don't you think?

594
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:02,360
Oh, I see. If you line the tatami up this way...

595
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,870
The blood stains will all come to the upper right.

596
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:09,170
So, the position of the tatamis were changed after all

597
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:12,040
when I found the corpse tonight!

598
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,540
But, why did Osho go out this far

599
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,440
to hide the corpse?

600
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,750
Why did he carry things out as he did when he didn't even kill the woman?

601
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:23,450
Well, why don't we go and ask Osho himself?

602
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:40,060
"Black. Monk's confession"

603
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,360
Right, why did Osho do it?

604
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,930
Why did he have to hide the fact

605
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,330
despite having to act out the role of the corpse himself?

606
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,730
Because he didn't want the woman

607
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,330
to be identified during investigation?

608
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:53,040
He didn't want anyone to know who or where that woman came from?

609
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,740
Who didn't he want to let know?

610
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:12,560
Oh, seeing that you've come back,

611
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,260
I guess I didn't do a complete job at hiding what went on after all.

612
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,560
Of course not!

613
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,930
You could never in a billion years

614
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:21,030
deceive the eyes of Detective Kogoro Mouri!

615
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,530
I'm sorry to say this,

616
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:25,040
but before I explain what went on,

617
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,640
I'd like to have Denkyu leave until I'm done...

618
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,340
The monk is already back at the car.

619
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,340
We asked him to stay behind with the girls

620
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,850
so they'd feel more assured!

621
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:37,550
Since you're concerned about that monk,

622
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:40,050
that lady who committed suicide here three days ago is...

623
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:42,150
Yes, it was Denkyu's mother

624
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:46,560
who put Denkyu into a cardboard box and abandoned him,

625
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,460
leaving him in front of this temple.

626
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,760
Oh, is that so?

627
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:55,130
Yes, she suddenly came here out of the blue

628
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:58,240
saying that she wanted her son back.

629
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,940
She also added that she had been visiting this temple every year

630
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:04,140
and watched him mature.

631
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,540
Therefore, I thought of

632
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:10,450
showing her the pictures of all the young monks here at the temple.

633
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:11,550
However, just as I figured,

634
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,650
she couldn't tell which monk was her son,

635
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:16,450
and she finally breaks out in tears.

636
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:19,160
She didn't even realize that

637
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,060
the one who brought the album to her was her own son.

638
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,530
After I told Denkyu to leave the room,

639
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,630
I couldn't stop myself from scolding her quite firmly.

640
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,630
I told her to spend the night at annex that night and calm herself down.

641
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,730
To think of sadness that her son

642
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,440
had experienced for the past 18 years,

643
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,940
and to feel the same sadness all the way in her bones.

644
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,940
Then, at the break of dawn, that's how she was found.

645
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:44,150
I thought it too ruthless to let Denkyu know of this,

646
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:47,650
so I carried out what I did.

647
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,260
Shall we go then?

648
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,760
You'll take me to the police, won't you?

649
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,160
Oh, yes.

650
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:02,930
I know I'm in no position to say something like this.

651
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,840
If you still plan on continuing your job as a detective

652
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,440
who corners people with words,

653
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,640
there is something I'd like you to always keep in mind.

654
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,340
Words can be as sharp as blades,

655
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,840
if used wrongly,

656
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,950
they can turn into lethal weapons.

657
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,650
They must be used with great care taking into the consideration

658
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:22,150
how the listener is feeling.

659
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:26,160
No matter what kind of person your listener may be.

660
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:37,030
Why did Osho hide the corpse?

661
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:40,140
Yeah, hurry and stop keeping us in suspense and tell us!

662
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,340
Heiji! Hey, Heiji...

663
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,540
Shut up!

664
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,740
I'm saying I don't want to talk about it, stupid!

665
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:50,050
I have a feeling that in his case,

666
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:54,050
he really doesn't know how to say what he wants to say.

667
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:14,540
"Mouri Detective Agency"

668
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,950
Shoots! I slept for 10 hours!

669
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:29,050
Oh, well, a lot of things happened last night

670
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:31,560
and we did come home late,

671
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,360
and besides today is the Sunday before the start of a holiday.

672
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,930
It seems like Heiji and Kazuha went home already too.

673
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,730
I'm going to bed now, because we're leaving early tomorrow.

674
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,340
He said so too.

675
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,640
But, I wonder if he remembers

676
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,640
my asking him to check on Rena Mizunashi.

677
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,850
Well, I guess I could send him mail later to be sure.

678
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,750
Darn, all gone.

679
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,150
Here, you can use mine.

680
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,450
Oh, thanks.

681
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,560
How come you're still here?

682
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,260
I thought you said you were leaving early in the morning?

683
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,160
Yeah, I was planning to,

684
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,560
but thanks to Pop's snore.

685
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,830
I mean it was so loud I couldn't sleep.

686
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,730
Thanks to him my schedule's all ruined.

687
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:20,240
Then, shouldn't buy your ticket all over again as soon as possible?

688
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,340
No, it's okay, I'm not leaving yet.

689
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,840
Why not?

690
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,550
What? An uninhabited island?

691
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,550
You mean, you're going there from now?

692
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:33,650
Yeah, I just happened to be able to view flowers in the meantime.

693
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:36,150
Do you have a case to check out for someone?

694
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,250
No.

695
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,160
It's this dopey plan of some TV station.

696
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,660
Hey, shut up!

697
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,060
But, is that all right?

698
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,830
Weren't you supposed to leave early in the morning?

699
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,130
No, we'll make it in way enough time

700
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,130
even if we were to head off there from now.

701
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:52,140
If so, then why?

702
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,240
I just wanted to go there before everyone else

703
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,640
and check out the faces and personalities of the guys

704
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,740
that were invited over there.

705
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,950
That is, what the other high school detectives like me look like.

706
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,850
High school detectives?

707
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:04,950
Right,

708
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,750
Nichiuri TV's gathering guys from throughout the country

709
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:10,150
and is going to be deciding who the number one high school detective is.

710
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:15,360
They have a sign that says, "Detective Championship Game."

711
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,700
"Blue. Beyond the see" -Detective Championship Game?

712
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,700
So, I told him to forget it!

713
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,210
Because he'll just end up being called a fool if he goes there.

714
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:33,380
I thought so too, but I couldn't help it!

715
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,980
I got a letter asking for me to participate.

716
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,980
For Heiji Hattori, to represent the Detective of the West.

717
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,890
Huh, the west?

718
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,590
Yeah, if I represent the west,

719
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,890
the east would of course be...

720
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,290
Shinichi?

721
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:52,100
Oh, Ran's crimson red!

722
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:56,500
Well, it's kind of warm today, isn't it? That's why.

723
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,000
Don't tell me that detective kid is going to be there.

724
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,610
I'm sure he'll be there.

725
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:02,310
No, he won't.

726
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:05,580
I mean he should know that I'm not, already.

727
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:09,180
How about it? Don't you and Ran also want to come along?

728
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,180
They say that there are lodgings for people who come along

729
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:17,090
and that snobbish high school detective Shinichi Kudo

730
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:20,690
just might be there too! Right?

731
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,200
You're late, Hattori.

732
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,800
Be on time, will you?

733
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,310
We're moving along by the minute, you know!

734
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,710
Oh, I'm sorry,

735
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,910
I kind of took the wrong road you see.

736
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:39,180
"Hiroo Tsuchio (41)" -Well, let's hurry on to the island!

737
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:42,080
Everyone's already on board the ship too!

738
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,080
Is Shinichi already there too?

739
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:49,090
Shinichi Kudo, the high school detective of the east!

740
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:51,190
They couldn't get a hold of him,

741
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,990
so they don't know if he's going to be there.

742
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,890
No joke?

743
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,600
Well, I guess so.

744
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,000
I mean, it's only natural...

745
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,800
But, do they really have lodgings

746
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,000
for people who come along to the uninhabited island?

747
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Oh, well...

748
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,310
there's only one old lodge on that island so...

749
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:12,580
the guardians will be spending the night at that hotel,

750
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,280
and after the shooting is over,

751
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,380
we want all of you to come pick them up.

752
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,690
Can I take this kid along with me?

753
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:22,890
He's sort of like my assistant, you see.

754
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:26,890
Okay, if he's going to be sleeping in your room together.

755
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:29,090
Gee, what a big ship it is.

756
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,200
How many people is it capable of taking?

757
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,800
Don't tell me that there is one detective

758
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,900
from all 47 prefectural and city governments?

759
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,400
No, we just called four detectives from the east, west, south and north.

760
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,400
We used this ship only because it stands out

761
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,810
and thought it would make meeting everyone here easier.

762
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:43,610
-What? -The ship we're boarding is over there.

763
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,880
It's this ship.

764
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,180
Come, hurry on board because we're pressed for time.

765
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,790
Hey, Hattori.

766
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:54,890
What?

767
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:58,390
Are you acquainted with that director of Nichiuri TV?

768
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:01,790
No. I met him for the first time today.

769
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,700
He told me that he'd be wearing the stadium jumper

770
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,900
with the mark of Nichiuri TV so to keep on the look out for him.

771
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,400
Heiji!

772
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,900
You're representing the Kansai district

773
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,800
so you're going to get it if you lose!

774
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,410
Okay! I'll be sure to leave a message behind

775
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,710
that says, "Heiji Hattori was here!"

776
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,580
So, after arriving on the island,

777
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,680
please stay in your rooms and don't leave until dinner time.

778
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,590
So, if anything's going to happen, it will be after dinner.

779
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,090
But be on your guard,

780
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,690
because the match is already started

781
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,590
as soon as you step foot on the island.

782
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,900
Okay.

783
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,200
Roger.

784
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,700
Strange, I figured everyone would be more excited

785
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,500
because this is a Detective Championship Game.

786
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,810
And why did you bring me along?

787
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:50,110
Don't tell me that you want me to team with you

788
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,880
so that you can win or something?

789
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:56,380
No, Shinichi Kudo of the east can't come anyway.

790
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,480
That's why I figured you should come and join us too.

791
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,990
It'll be too boring if I win the game just like that.

792
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:05,890
You're about the only one here that's an equal match for me.

793
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:09,890
But, you even brought Ran and the others over too.

794
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:14,400
I wouldn't come to such a corny game alone myself either.

795
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:23,510
Are you seasick?

796
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:26,380
Oh, no. It's a hang-over.

797
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,280
It took a while to shoot yesterday so...

798
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,480
I went out drinking with the staff after we finished, and got wasted.

799
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:36,390
So, you went "overboard".

800
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,790
"Overboard?"

801
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:42,190
Well, the shop was really high priced.

802
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:46,100
Hey, mister, this is in the way, laugh, will you? It's too narrow.

803
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,700
Laugh? A narrow heart.

804
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:52,500
Oh, you were playing on words using "overboard" and "high."

805
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:59,280
Those two seem pretty sharp.

806
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,380
Detective Championship Game?

807
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,180
Nichuri TV?

808
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:07,090
We have no such reservation.

809
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:09,490
Hey, check it out carefully, will you?

810
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:12,290
Dinner and breakfast are supposed to be included too.

811
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:14,990
-Yes, but... -What?

812
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:16,790
What's going on?

813
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,200
Welcome.

814
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,610
I'm the one who will be taking care of you,

815
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:30,210
my name is Renzo Koya.

816
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:34,080
Nice to meet you all. I'll show you to your lodge.

817
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,480
Hey, director.

818
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,880
If the high school detective of the east isn't coming,

819
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,290
I'd like to talk something over with you.

820
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,290
Huh?

821
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,190
The representative from the east

822
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:50,700
arrived here early this morning and is already at the lodge.

823
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,500
What did you say? Is that true?

824
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,500
If I remember correctly, his name was...

825
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:04,210
I see.

826
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,180
"Please cancel tomorrow's" -This is indeed

827
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,380
"Please cancel tomorrow's" -an isolated island cut off

828
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,980
"dinner reservation." -from the outside world.

829
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:14,390
There couldn't be a situation better than this for a mystery.

830
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:17,790
Saguru Hakuba?

831
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:22,190
Who is he?

832
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,760
"White. Highschool Detective in East" -So, now

833
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,370
"White. Highschool Detective in East" -since the high school detectives

834
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:32,170
of the east, west, south and north are all here

835
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,070
let's start with self-introduction!

836
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:35,370
Okay.

837
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:38,070
Are you're sure you don't mind the cameras not rolling?

838
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:41,740
I mean, there are no TV staff here at all!

839
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:44,250
Oh, the crew and TV talent who is MC for this program

840
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:46,150
are scheduled to be arriving tomorrow.

841
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:49,850
I wanted all of you to be here a day ahead.

842
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,250
Okay then.

843
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:54,360
I'm Natsuki Koshimizu, a junior in high school.

844
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,260
I was born in Fukuoka and is representing the south.

845
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,960
But, I've only solved about 100 cases to date,

846
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,660
so am still a beginner,

847
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,370
so take it easy on me, okay?

848
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:06,770
My name is Junya Tokitsu.

849
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:09,570
I was born in Tokyo, but since I was raised in Hokkaido,

850
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:12,070
I'm here representing the north.

851
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:14,340
I've solved up to 300 cases up to date.

852
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:17,650
People have been arrested and indicted in 250 of those cases.

853
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:19,450
But there were people who escaped

854
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:22,450
or committed suicide among them too.

855
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:23,850
I'm Heiji Hattori.

856
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:26,960
I'm pretty well-known in the Kansai district.

857
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,260
The number of cases that I've solved so far is one, two, three...

858
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,860
Well, with over a thousand cases to my name,

859
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,160
I've lost track already!

860
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,370
A thousand cases.

861
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:39,570
Wow.

862
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,970
Hey, stop bluffing like that.

863
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:44,270
It's true,

864
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:47,040
if I include the times I searched for cats in my childhood.

865
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,750
I see, so you're Heiji Hattori.

866
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,950
My dad used to talk a lot about you.

867
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,250
He said that you're a detective with very keen intuition.

868
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,250
Huh?

869
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:59,850
How come your dad knows me?

870
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:01,960
Because he's the same as you, Heiji.

871
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:02,960
Same as me?

872
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,960
Right, Hakuba?

873
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,060
Yeah, my father is a police commissioner.

874
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,260
So, strangely enough,

875
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,570
I lived in an environment similar to yours being that

876
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:15,070
your father was the leader of the Osaka Prefectural Police.

877
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:18,170
By the way, how many cases have you solved?

878
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:21,540
Well, I guess just about 500 cases.

879
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,540
What? That's only half the number compared to mine!

880
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:26,750
Yes, but that's if I limit the cases

881
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,150
to those that I solved here in Japan.

882
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:30,550
What?

883
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:33,050
I've been staying in England as an exchange student for awhile

884
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:35,860
and only returned to Japan occasionally,

885
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,260
but my nanny would take on requests

886
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,760
for solving cases of her own discretion.

887
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,560
It's so unexpected that

888
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,870
Hakuba who is famous abroad is here representing the east.

889
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:48,670
Yep, I was so sure that it was going to be Shinichi Kudo.

890
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:51,470
Right, the high school detective of the east

891
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:55,940
is none other than Shinichi Kudo, right? It's not you!

892
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:00,650
My nanny took the call from the director over there.

893
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:03,150
He said that he wanted me to participate in place of Shinichi Kudo

894
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:06,750
who he couldn't get a hold of as representative of the east.

895
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:10,260
Nanny was hurt by the phrase, "in place of"

896
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,260
and pleaded in tears for me to show the world

897
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:16,060
that Hakuba is the high school detective of the east.

898
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:20,370
So, I had no choice but to come back from England.

899
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,070
That's the story,

900
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:25,670
but it seems that I'm not suited to represent the east, am I?

901
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:27,340
Of course you're not.

902
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,940
Then, why don't we do this?

903
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:32,950
I'm a guest participant from abroad.

904
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:37,150
We'll appoint Conan Edogawa here as representative of the east.

905
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:40,350
This young man here is pretty good at deductions too.

906
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:42,060
I'm sure he is equal to if not better than the youth called...

907
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,660
what's his name, Kudo.

908
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,460
"What's his name"?

909
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,160
But he's still a child...

910
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,670
Who cares, no problem.

911
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:52,470
I'd like to go to my room quickly.

912
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:53,670
I'm pooped.

913
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,870
I'd like to have dinner too.

914
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:57,970
Oh, right.

915
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:01,340
Okay. Mr. Koya is making dinner now

916
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:03,850
so I'll come get all of you when it's ready.

917
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:06,650
Oh, and I'd like to check your outfits that you'll be wearing

918
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:07,850
when shooting the program tomorrow,

919
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,150
so please wear it when coming to dinner.

920
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:11,850
Make sure you wear outfits that suit the Detective Championship Game

921
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,750
as we talked over the telephone.

922
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,760
Huh, what?

923
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,660
There's no such program?

924
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:19,460
Is that true, Yoko?

925
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:22,860
No, I asked around the TV station,

926
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:24,670
but nobody's heard of a special program

927
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:26,070
called Detective Championship Game.

928
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:29,670
Are you sure the man was really from Nichiuri TV?

929
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:32,370
Yeah, he was wearing the stadium jumper of the station

930
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:36,240
and his name is Hiroo Tsuchio.

931
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,250
What?

932
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:39,850
There's no director by that name?

933
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:44,950
-Then who was that man... -That took the two of them?

934
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:46,150
I see,

935
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:48,760
that's what you call an outfit suited for the Detective Championship game.

936
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,260
Yeah, I hate to dress like this

937
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,560
other than to school or funerals.

938
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:58,570
But, what a surprise that you knew that snobbish guy.

939
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:00,470
Oh, you mean Suguru Hakuba.

940
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:02,270
I met him when solving a case in the past.

941
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:04,470
Did he get you that upset?

942
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:08,440
Yeah, I hate the snobbish way he talks, like he's looking down at you.

943
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,350
-He so much like you. -Oh...

944
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:15,250
Well, at least you're cute, so way better than him in a way, though.

945
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:16,450
I see.

946
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:20,050
But from here, we're enemies.

947
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:24,360
Don't talk to me no matter what comes up.

948
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,460
Come in?

949
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:30,670
Excuse me. Dinner's ready, so please come to the dining room.

950
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:35,170
This sure is an old lodge.

951
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:37,970
It looks to be fixed here and there, though.

952
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:39,570
Who owns this place?

953
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:42,740
I wonder? I hear that some rich person is renting it out

954
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:45,450
since he has no use for it anymore.

955
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:50,850
By the way, has she already gone to the dining room?

956
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:51,950
She?

957
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:54,960
No, I was just about to go call her now.

958
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,060
Is there a woman here on this island too?

959
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:00,460
She was with us all the while.

960
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:01,760
Yes!

961
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:05,470
Dinner's ready.

962
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:07,170
Oh, it's it time already?

963
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,670
Oh no! I guess I took too much time!

964
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:12,970
You mean, she was a woman?

965
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:15,240
My school has strict rules.

966
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,940
Skirts have to be 3 cm below the knee,

967
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:18,450
scarves have to be symmetrical right and left,

968
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:19,550
socks have to be black,

969
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:21,050
and of course perms aren't allowed.

970
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:23,050
If we shave our eyebrows, we get suspended.

971
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:24,550
God knows how many times I was warned about

972
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:26,150
this naturally brown hair of mine.

973
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:28,660
But, I guess it's no big deal tonight

974
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:30,660
because the cameras aren't here yet, right?

975
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,760
Yeah, I guess so.

976
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,360
Hey, you didn't change clothes.

977
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,060
Yes, because unlike you people

978
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:40,870
the school that I attend in England has no uniform.

979
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:44,070
Wow, it looks delicious.

980
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:46,170
Did you make all this, sir?

981
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:49,040
-Yes. -Huh, where's the director?

982
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:53,350
When I went to get him at his room a while ago, there was no answer,

983
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:56,950
so I though he had already come here.

984
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:59,950
Please show me to his room.

985
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:01,860
Mr. Tsuchio.

986
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:05,860
Dinner's ready. Mr. Tsuchio?

987
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:09,160
No good, I guess he locked it so he could sleep.

988
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:16,370
Blood.

989
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:20,340
There's blood on the door knob.

990
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:23,040
-Do you have a spare key? -No, there is no key to begin with,

991
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,950
because like your rooms, the key can only be locked from inside.

992
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:29,450
If the rooms are the same, there should be two windows.

993
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:31,750
Then, let's look inside through the window.

994
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:34,860
You...

995
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,260
Mr. Tsuchio!

996
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,060
"Gray. Highschool Detective in North" -Mr. Tsuchio!

997
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:54,270
"Gray. Highschool Detective in North" -The window is locked.

998
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:56,580
It seems the door was completely locked too.

999
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:58,580
Then, this is a locked door murder case?

1000
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:04,120
Yes, but obviously that's only if he's dead.

1001
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,300
He's alive.

1002
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,200
What happened?

1003
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,100
What a relief! What happened?

1004
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,910
Oh, somebody knocked on the door.

1005
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:20,510
I answered the door. But, there was no one there.

1006
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:22,010
When I was about to go back into the room,

1007
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:24,910
I was suddenly drugged from behind.

1008
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:29,290
Problem number one of the Detective Championship Game!

1009
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:31,690
Solve this locked room mystery.

1010
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:34,590
After solving the mystery, write it down

1011
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:35,990
and bring it to me.

1012
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:40,300
If your deduction is the truth, you will make it to the second level

1013
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:44,300
and as well as allowed to leave this island.

1014
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,800
Which means that the battle has already been launched!

1015
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:51,810
Then, is there a hidden camera somewhere?

1016
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:53,210
But, how unexpected.

1017
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:55,810
I thought that the first level was to see through

1018
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:58,410
the fact that this person is a fake director.

1019
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:01,220
Just what do you think you're saying? I'm really...

1020
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,690
Quit playing dumb with us.

1021
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:07,190
Back then, when he said you went overboard,

1022
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:09,990
he meant you had a tough time because the shooting

1023
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:13,000
took all the way till after midnight.

1024
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,500
And the remark, "laugh" that the girl made after that

1025
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,800
means do something about something.

1026
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,800
I mean you're no new AD and all.

1027
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:26,210
There's no director that doesn't understand movie language like those.

1028
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:29,210
Besides, that mark of Nichiuri TV that you have on you is strange.

1029
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:31,610
The groove of the eye isn't right.

1030
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:34,420
The real one grooves in the opposite direction.

1031
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:38,790
That's why everyone figured you were a fake and tested you.

1032
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:42,790
Well, you can explain after we make complete the first round though.

1033
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:46,700
Sorry, but count me out.

1034
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:49,000
I've figured out

1035
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,100
this locked room trick.

1036
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,900
Would you like me to show you?

1037
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,600
You've already solved it.

1038
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,210
Okay, show us.

1039
00:53:58,210 --> 00:53:59,810
No, you can't.

1040
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:03,810
If you do so, the others will also figure out the trick.

1041
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:05,510
So, please write your deduction down

1042
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:08,020
and bring it to me like I mentioned a while ago.

1043
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:11,890
This is the first round, you know, and not the finals.

1044
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:15,490
Don't worry, he wouldn't do it right before our eyes.

1045
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:17,390
Well, as far as I'm concerned,

1046
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:20,800
the result would be the same even if this were to be the finals, though.

1047
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,900
What confidence.

1048
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:25,400
I hope that trick isn't something that goes like,

1049
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:29,310
Mr. Tsuchio who was tied up in the locked room,

1050
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:32,110
after locking the door tied himself up, is it?

1051
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:33,310
No way,

1052
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:34,810
because if so, the representative of the west

1053
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:37,910
who untied him would've noticed,

1054
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:41,220
no matter how incapable a detective he is.

1055
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:43,190
How dare you call me incapable?

1056
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:45,190
That's true, it wasn't smart.

1057
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:47,590
You found blood on the door knob,

1058
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:50,290
broke the door down and entered the room.

1059
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:51,490
In that case,

1060
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:53,900
we should've checked things out by looking in from the window

1061
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,900
and then decide whether we should break the door down

1062
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,600
or crack the window and enter.

1063
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,900
Because if Mr. Tsuchio was leaning against the door

1064
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:02,000
or moreover, dead,

1065
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,610
at the point that the door is kicked open, the corpse would move,

1066
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:07,310
as well as disperse the evidence.

1067
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:09,010
Stupid, back then...

1068
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:10,410
Overreaching and carrying things too far

1069
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:13,620
for wanting to make it to scene before anyone else does.

1070
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:16,490
Aren't such people considered disqualified as detectives?

1071
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:17,890
Watch your tongue!

1072
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:20,190
He's not disqualified.

1073
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,890
Kudo.

1074
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:26,200
Heiji is just a bit too quick tempered.

1075
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,500
Hey...

1076
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,800
At any rate, I'm going back up to my room on the second floor

1077
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,600
and turn my room into a locked room,

1078
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,600
so wait for me while having dinner, will you?

1079
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,710
It'll take me at least an hour to do so.

1080
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:39,010
An hour?

1081
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:42,610
I see, the time it took Mr. Koya to show us to our rooms,

1082
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:45,010
to the time what happened at this room

1083
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:46,820
took just about the same time.

1084
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,190
The trick is an intricate one that requires that much time.

1085
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:51,990
Well, I guess so.

1086
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:53,690
I'd like to say this, just in case, though.

1087
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:56,790
This trick does not call for the foolish, uncouth detective's

1088
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:57,990
ill-mannered actions,

1089
00:55:57,990 --> 00:55:59,400
so please keep that in mind.

1090
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,100
Well, I'm sure that he won't repeat the same mistake again.

1091
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,600
After all, he's got his local reputation as his father's name

1092
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,100
as chief of Osaka Police Department to maintain too.

1093
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:11,510
Right, representative of the west?

1094
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:13,210
But...

1095
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:17,210
I like passionate detectives like you.

1096
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:21,580
It's a ship

1097
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,390
-that was anchored around here... -What's the matter, Kazuha?

1098
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:26,890
-and took the children. -Well, I have this bad feeling.

1099
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:28,890
The cell phone, it's still not going through?

1100
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:30,490
-The number you have reached... -No,

1101
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:32,090
it's still in the out of service area,

1102
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:33,800
and just keeps repeating that message.

1103
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,100
I see.

1104
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:39,100
Hey, Ran, don't you feel something strange?

1105
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:42,000
Like an unidentifiable eerie something

1106
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,610
is closing in on Heiji and the others.

1107
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,210
I think you're letting your imagination get the better of you.

1108
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:50,910
I'm sure that Heiji is okay and that he'll come back with Conan.

1109
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:53,020
I know, but something bothers me.

1110
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:55,990
The face of Heiji when he was being escorted off

1111
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:59,090
keep twirling around in my head over and over.

1112
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:02,290
How about Conan's cell phone?

1113
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:03,490
You still can't contact him?

1114
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:05,900
Nope, his is no good either.

1115
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,100
I wish that the representative of the east,

1116
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,600
Shinichi Kudo were there together with Heiji at a time like this.

1117
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,400
I would make me feel way better.

1118
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,110
The number you have reached is out of service range...

1119
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:19,010
It's the same with Shinichi's cell phone too.

1120
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:22,310
Don't tell me that Shinichi is with them too?

1121
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:41,890
"Purple. Scent of Lavender"

1122
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:45,060
It's out of service range after all.

1123
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,860
Well, this is an isolated island.

1124
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:50,660
What, no joke?

1125
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:52,170
I just went to the restroom for a while

1126
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:54,470
and yet there almost nothing left already.

1127
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:56,570
Hey, mister, you're eating too much.

1128
00:57:56,570 --> 00:57:59,870
I know, I was starved, you see.

1129
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:01,370
Gosh.

1130
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:03,780
Okay, so now that you're filled, tell us.

1131
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,680
Won't you, fake TV director?

1132
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:09,580
Tell us why you're participating as a fake TV director

1133
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,480
for this Detective Championship Game.

1134
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,690
If this program is to measure our capabilities,

1135
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:15,690
what's your role?

1136
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:17,290
No. I can't tell you that

1137
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:19,560
because if I do, I won't get paid. I bound by contract.

1138
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:22,460
With Nichiuri TV?

1139
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:25,870
Then, will you answer this question?

1140
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:29,870
I was concerned since I set foot into this lodge

1141
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:33,070
about the fragrance of the lavender flower over there.

1142
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:36,180
Now that you mentioned it, there is a lavender flower in our room too.

1143
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,280
Yeah.

1144
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,980
There's one in my room too.

1145
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,480
It seems to be in every room.

1146
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:45,390
And that toolbox that's sitting over there.

1147
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:47,990
There's a meaning to it too, isn't there?

1148
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:50,090
Well, I wonder.

1149
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:53,460
It is the detective's job to figure that out.

1150
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:55,460
That's how I see it, is it not?

1151
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:59,470
True, but since we're separated from the outside world,

1152
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,370
we don't have the means to check.

1153
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:04,470
Homicide at Lavender Manor.

1154
00:59:07,470 --> 00:59:10,080
The only thing lavenders bring to my mind

1155
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:14,080
is the incident that occurred in Shikoku a year ago.

1156
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,280
I've heard of that case too.

1157
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,890
The one who was killed was the lady of the mansion.

1158
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:34,970
Miss!

1159
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:37,670
"Young Lady at the Lavender Manor Commits Suicide"

1160
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:40,270
"Motive Unknown. The Door is Locked"

1161
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:42,080
"Possibility of Intruder"

1162
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:46,780
But it was found six months later that she had been murdered.

1163
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:48,480
And? The killer?

1164
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,080
Committed suicide before getting caught.

1165
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,190
That's what I heard.

1166
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:57,590
What's up?

1167
00:59:57,590 --> 00:59:59,160
No, well, you see...

1168
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,560
I forgot my cigarettes in my room.

1169
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,570
Wow, it's really raining cats and dogs now.

1170
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:16,080
What's the matter? You're drenched.

1171
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,280
Did you go look for a cigarette vending machine outside or something?

1172
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,580
Oh, no, I just went to check how things were outside.

1173
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:25,490
By the way, don't you think he's a bit too much time?

1174
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:28,690
Yes, it's been more than two hours since then already.

1175
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:30,590
I'll go ask him

1176
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:32,160
how much longer he thinks it will take him.

1177
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,260
Okay, please do.

1178
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,460
What? He's not in his room?

1179
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:39,270
No, no matter how many times I knock on the door,

1180
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:40,370
there's no answer.

1181
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:44,270
But, the door was locked, so maybe...

1182
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:47,370
I see, he probably completed the locked room

1183
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:49,680
and is watching from somewhere, snickering at us.

1184
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,480
If so, I'm sure he'd appear before us

1185
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,580
with that boastful look of his.

1186
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:57,480
I'll go check from outside, so wait here.

1187
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,390
Let me go with you!

1188
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:02,590
It worries me to let you go alone.

1189
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:04,190
Suit yourself.

1190
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:12,370
Come on. He's still there.

1191
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:18,320
He was smeared with blood, wasn't he?

1192
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,120
Yeah. Let's hurry to the room.

1193
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:25,430
You?

1194
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,240
Shoots.

1195
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,140
How is it, Heiji?

1196
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:42,810
No good! He's really dead.

1197
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,520
How are things?

1198
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,620
Just as you can see,

1199
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:53,920
he died on the spot after being hit on the head.

1200
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,730
The murder weapon is probably that hammer.

1201
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:57,630
It's got blood on it too.

1202
01:01:57,630 --> 01:01:59,730
It was probably taken from that toolbox

1203
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:02,030
next to the lavender flowerpot.

1204
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:03,230
Were the windows locked?

1205
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:04,730
Yeah, they were,

1206
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:08,640
nice and tight until I opened them.

1207
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:12,110
The window frame also seems to be tightly in place with a screw.

1208
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:16,710
The entrance door doesn't look to have been tampered with either.

1209
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:20,720
Since there are no other escape holes or doors...

1210
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,520
It's a locked room murder.

1211
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,220
Moreover, the killers are either

1212
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:25,620
Ms. Koshimizu,

1213
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:28,830
Mr. Koya or Mr. Tsuchio, no?

1214
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:30,530
What? Brat!

1215
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:32,230
Why us?

1216
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:33,630
True.

1217
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:34,930
After Tokitsu left the room saying that

1218
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:38,640
he was going to turn his room on the second floor into a locked room,

1219
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,940
we began having dinner at the dining room downstairs.

1220
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:45,910
I left to go to the restroom, and wasn't there for about ten minutes.

1221
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:48,210
A few minutes after I returned,

1222
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:51,210
Mr. Tsuchio went to his room to get his cigarettes

1223
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:54,320
and Mr. Koya went to check on Tokitsu.

1224
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:58,620
If all during that time, Hakuba and you two were together,

1225
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:00,320
it would be most plausible.

1226
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:03,830
Hold it, I was only hired to come here.

1227
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:04,830
By who?

1228
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:07,130
The TV station would never plan a program like this

1229
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:09,030
where somebody would actually die, would they?

1230
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:10,430
I really thought it was a program

1231
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:11,940
that the TV station had planned to do.

1232
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:14,340
I'm an actor and I belong to an acting school.

1233
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:20,010
I received a letter asking to act the role of a TV director.

1234
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:21,710
I was told I'd be given an advance payment of 500,000 yen,

1235
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:23,110
and if the fact that I'm a fake is not revealed,

1236
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:24,810
I was supposed to have received another 500,000 yen.

1237
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:27,020
It's a great job that anybody would jump at, isn't it?

1238
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:28,320
And, now that everything's out in the light?

1239
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:33,520
Even so, if I just go through with the game,

1240
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,330
I was told I'd be given half the pay, that's 250,000 yen.

1241
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:40,230
Then, why did you go to your room to get your cigarette,

1242
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:44,230
and yet go outside and get drenched in the rain?

1243
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:46,340
I wanted to use the wireless radio that's in the shed

1244
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:48,040
to make emergency contact.

1245
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,040
But...

1246
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,940
it was destroyed!

1247
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:52,710
When I came to check the place out three days ago,

1248
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:54,910
it was just fine.

1249
01:03:54,910 --> 01:03:56,710
-Honestly? -Yeah.

1250
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:58,720
But, how strange.

1251
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:02,620
You headed for the shed before this murder was committed.

1252
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:06,320
How did you know that this sort of emergency was going to happen?

1253
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,930
I just had a premonition.

1254
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:11,230
Honestly.

1255
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:15,630
Then, Mr. Koya, were also called by Mr. Tsuchio?

1256
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:19,540
Yes, I came here two days ago to look after all of you.

1257
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:22,340
I just happened to get time off

1258
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:25,210
from the household that I serve as steward so.

1259
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:28,210
But, you already knew the answer to the locked room murder, right?

1260
01:04:28,210 --> 01:04:30,410
Because you told us to write the answer down and take it to you.

1261
01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:33,320
I was told to say so if something happened in the locked room.

1262
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:35,420
The order went on to say to sneak the answer sheet

1263
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:37,920
under the toilet mat.

1264
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,820
That's a clever way to put it.

1265
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:42,430
As if there's someone else pulling the strings behind the scene.

1266
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:44,330
No, I'm telling the truth.

1267
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:47,730
Whatever the story, I'm in the same boat as you all are.

1268
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:50,630
I was just told to come here as a high school detective

1269
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:54,240
representing the south by that fake TV director.

1270
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,610
I hate thunder!

1271
01:04:58,610 --> 01:05:01,110
So, please close the window, quick, please.

1272
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:02,610
Yeah.

1273
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:05,720
Don't worry. I'll silence the thunder

1274
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:07,620
as well as the case soon.

1275
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:09,520
What's with him?

1276
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:17,430
At any rate, we three will check the place

1277
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:19,930
so you three suspects wait in the first floor dining room

1278
01:05:19,930 --> 01:05:22,430
-till it's done. -If I could have my way,

1279
01:05:22,430 --> 01:05:26,140
I would like you to do likewise and wait with them too.

1280
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:28,040
You're much too hot-tempered,

1281
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,340
or should I say reckless?

1282
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:30,940
What?

1283
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:33,810
Look at the shattered pieces of glass!

1284
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:37,110
And the footprints of your muddy shoes left on the desk!

1285
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:39,320
What a dreadful sight!

1286
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,820
Don't tell me that you opened the lock with your bare hands too.

1287
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:43,420
Yeah, I opened it!

1288
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:44,620
Bug you!

1289
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:46,220
He's venting his anger out on the wrong person.

1290
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:48,930
You really disappoint me.

1291
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:50,130
From what my father told me about you,

1292
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:52,930
I thought you were way more capable.

1293
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:55,530
After taking them to the dining room,

1294
01:05:55,530 --> 01:05:57,830
we'll be resuming investigation

1295
01:05:57,830 --> 01:06:00,140
but please try not to get in the way,

1296
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:02,240
representative of the west, okay?

1297
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:08,010
Hey, Kudo. Am I wrong?

1298
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:10,610
No. Not at all.

1299
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:12,820
Not at all?

1300
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:14,020
I'm referring to a ship that a man with a mustache,

1301
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:17,820
three high school students and a child boarded!

1302
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:21,830
There's no way you couldn't have seen them at all, right?

1303
01:06:21,830 --> 01:06:23,430
What's the matter, Kazuha?

1304
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:26,830
Something bothers me after all

1305
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:28,430
about the look on Heiji's face back then.

1306
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:29,930
Okay, I'll leave behind a message saying,

1307
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:33,440
"Heiji Hattori was here!"

1308
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,640
Heiji was here?

1309
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:41,710
Ran, when Heiji said, "He was here..."

1310
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:43,710
Could he have meant...

1311
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:50,570
"Blue, White and Black. Each person's reasoning" -Well, the thing

1312
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:52,570
"Blue, White and Black. Each person's reasoning" -that bugs me most is...

1313
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:56,840
that the killer deliberately made Tokitsu sit on the desk.

1314
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,640
This position.

1315
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,950
Is there any meaning to it?

1316
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:02,950
One of the reasons may be that

1317
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:06,250
the killer simply wanted the locked room murder to be visible from outside.

1318
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:08,450
However...

1319
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:12,060
And I wonder about the lavender and toolbox.

1320
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:14,960
There seems to be both of them everyone else's room too.

1321
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:20,770
No use staring from outside.

1322
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:22,470
-I'm opening it. -Wait.

1323
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:25,770
-Let me. -Go ahead!

1324
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:33,340
Wires, nails, a wrench, a screw driver,

1325
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:35,850
a drill, a steel ruler, a plier,

1326
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:37,550
glue for wood products,

1327
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:39,650
a saw, a utility knife.

1328
01:07:39,650 --> 01:07:42,050
Just as I thought, there's no hammer inside.

1329
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:45,060
It seems that the murder weapon was taken out of here

1330
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:46,660
After all, with a hammer like that,

1331
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:49,160
a man, a woman

1332
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:51,960
or even an elderly person could commit the murder.

1333
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,070
Time wise that's true.

1334
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:57,270
The time that those three disappeared from our sight

1335
01:07:57,270 --> 01:08:01,170
was from 19:26 and 32 seconds

1336
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:03,640
to 19:39 and 15 seconds, to go to the restroom.

1337
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:06,040
Mr. Tsuchio, who went to his room to get his cigarettes

1338
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:11,050
was gone from 20:06 and 47 seconds to 21:28 and 21 seconds.

1339
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:14,250
And finally Mr. Koya, who came to check on Mr. Tokitsu came to this room

1340
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:19,260
and was gone from 21:30 and 6 seconds to 21:38 and 52 seconds.

1341
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:22,760
Any of the three had enough time to commit the murder.

1342
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,460
He even had the seconds recorded.

1343
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:28,470
But, Mr. Koya seems to have been in the kitchen most of the time.

1344
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:29,870
So, he would've been able to hide and move around freely

1345
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:31,970
without having to worry about us watching him.

1346
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:33,870
Well, but the kitchen windows

1347
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:36,940
are all ones that cannot be opened or closed,

1348
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:39,240
and are only there to let the light in.

1349
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,250
As for the kitchen door it's here,

1350
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,750
that is, in order to go out,

1351
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:45,850
he'll have to pass the dining room, where we are,

1352
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:48,650
so I'm sure Mr. Koya was in the kitchen all the while.

1353
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:50,560
By the way, this is the blueprint of the second floor

1354
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:54,160
and all the four rooms are very similar except for a light difference

1355
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:55,860
in the direction the windows are facing.

1356
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:59,160
You sure work fast.

1357
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:03,070
I've been here a half day earlier than you all, you see.

1358
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:04,770
Come to think of it,

1359
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:07,170
why is there electricity here?

1360
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:08,670
Right...

1361
01:09:08,670 --> 01:09:10,240
it's an uninhabited island and yet.

1362
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:13,550
A simple generator seems to be in the shed.

1363
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:15,750
Would you like to go take a look?

1364
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:16,950
We could go check out the wireless radio

1365
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:19,250
that's supposed to be there while we're at it too.

1366
01:09:28,610 --> 01:09:30,710
True.

1367
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:34,220
Talk about destroyed...

1368
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,720
So this is the generator,

1369
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:41,890
wasn't there a lock to this place?

1370
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:44,890
There should've been a padlock.

1371
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:48,000
I'm sure that Mr. Koya had the lock.

1372
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,000
The padlock's

1373
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,310
been forced opened!

1374
01:09:57,310 --> 01:10:00,110
Talk about a lot of muddy shoe prints...

1375
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:01,710
It's Mr. Tsuchio's,

1376
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:05,210
since he's the only one who came outside after it started raining.

1377
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:08,320
Isn't that right, Hakuba?

1378
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,020
Huh? He's gone.

1379
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:13,020
What's with him? He disappeared.

1380
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:15,020
It's gone.

1381
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:16,690
It's not here.

1382
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:21,800
The wire from the toolbox in this person's room is gone after all.

1383
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,400
Isn't Hakuba back?

1384
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:29,400
No, wasn't he together with you?

1385
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:33,410
By the way, did you find anything after checking the shed?

1386
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:35,110
Well, sort of.

1387
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:37,210
No way.

1388
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:41,020
The man's drunk.

1389
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:44,120
You guys all claim that you're detectives

1390
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:46,420
but you're all no more than green horns

1391
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:48,890
that look capable on the outside.

1392
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:55,300
Then, let's have them listen

1393
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:58,000
to the deduction of the green-horn, shall we?

1394
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,500
I see.

1395
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,810
So, that's the story.

1396
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:08,710
No doubt about it,

1397
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:09,810
the culprit is...

1398
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:11,010
that person.

1399
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:13,110
That man.

1400
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:14,120
Right?

1401
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:18,120
He killed Tokitsu and prepared the locked room.

1402
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:23,490
Mr. Renzo Koya.

1403
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,400
Well, it's really simple with a little bit of thinking.

1404
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,600
Tokitsu said it would take about an hour

1405
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,500
to rig his room into a locked room.

1406
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:40,410
In other words, it was a trick that was that intricate.

1407
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:42,210
You naturally went to check him out

1408
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:45,910
just about when the room would be ready and killed him.

1409
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:48,420
It could be carried out very naturally if you used his room

1410
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:51,420
that was prepared for the locked room murder.

1411
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:54,020
So, it wouldn't have been possible for Koshimizu who went to the restroom

1412
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:57,490
right after Tokitsu said so and left.

1413
01:11:57,490 --> 01:12:00,200
Nor for Mr. Tsuchio who left 30 minutes later

1414
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,200
to his room to get his cigarette

1415
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,600
to commit the murder.

1416
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:06,800
In other words, you, Mr. Renzo Koya, who went to see him alone

1417
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,700
just before he was found killed in the locked room

1418
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:12,310
is the only one

1419
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:13,910
who could've killed him.

1420
01:12:13,910 --> 01:12:16,610
Oh, boy...

1421
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:20,010
How much do you have to disappoint me before you stop?

1422
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:23,520
I'm sorry to say that he's not the one.

1423
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,320
Because the one who committed the crime

1424
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:29,190
is one who can unlock and lock doors and windows just by using a wire.

1425
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:32,190
That person is Mr. Tsuchio.

1426
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:33,900
It's you.

1427
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:35,900
Don't be ridiculous!

1428
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:38,600
The padlock that was on the shed that you headed for

1429
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:41,800
after lying that you were going to go get your cigarette.

1430
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:44,710
New traces of it having been forced opened were seen,

1431
01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:47,610
moreover, it found wet and thrown into the shed.

1432
01:12:47,610 --> 01:12:51,010
In other words, the one who forced the door open was Mr. Tsuchio,

1433
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:53,210
the only one who went outside after it began raining.

1434
01:12:53,210 --> 01:12:55,520
On top of that, only the wire was found missing

1435
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:58,320
from the toolbox in your room.

1436
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,620
How did he make the locked room, though?

1437
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:02,290
Mr. Tsuchio mentioned that

1438
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:05,090
he came here three days ago to check the place out beforehand.

1439
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:06,790
At that time he probably,

1440
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:10,300
opened a small hole in the window of that room.

1441
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:13,000
Then, after killing Mr. Tokitsu tonight,

1442
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,600
he went outside from the window,

1443
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:16,300
and from the hole in the glass he made previously,

1444
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:19,310
used the wire to lock the window,

1445
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:25,110
He probably figured beforehand that Hattori

1446
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:26,820
would break through the window glass later

1447
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,220
and make a grand entrance into the room,

1448
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:32,720
making it impossible to find the hole made in the glass.

1449
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:35,890
He then went to destroy the wireless radio in the shed,

1450
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:39,190
to breed anxiety in us and corner us mentally.

1451
01:13:39,190 --> 01:13:42,000
He was ready to kill another one of us after that!

1452
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,400
Isn't that right?

1453
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:44,700
No way!

1454
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:46,600
I don't think so.

1455
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:51,910
Even if he were able to predict that

1456
01:13:51,910 --> 01:13:54,410
Heiji would break through the glass window,

1457
01:13:54,410 --> 01:13:56,410
he wouldn't have been able to tell

1458
01:13:56,410 --> 01:13:58,310
which of the four windows he would break through!

1459
01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:01,720
Besides, although Heiji is hot tempered,

1460
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:04,020
I'm sure he would've noticed if there was a hole.

1461
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:06,320
Never mind the hot tempered.

1462
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,790
But the one who forced opened the padlock of the shed

1463
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:10,390
is unmistakably him.

1464
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:13,900
Yeah, it's true that this man has a bad habit,

1465
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:15,100
but that's about it.

1466
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:18,900
Or, is it that you have an equation in your head

1467
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:22,300
that says, "A thief is the killer?"

1468
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:26,010
I guess I goofed.

1469
01:14:26,010 --> 01:14:29,010
So, what with the locked room, trick?

1470
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:31,610
Yep, it's a super simple trick!

1471
01:14:31,610 --> 01:14:34,620
First, you remove all the screws holding the window frames in place.

1472
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:36,320
Then, you remove the windows.

1473
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:40,320
Finally, cut all the screws short using pliers and all set!

1474
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,290
Then you insert the head of the screw that had been cut off

1475
01:14:42,290 --> 01:14:43,490
back into the window frame,

1476
01:14:43,490 --> 01:14:45,890
and put glue on the area around the window frame.

1477
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:49,400
Then, you go outside and fix the entire window in place.

1478
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:52,200
In other words, it looks like the window is fixed on with screws,

1479
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,200
but the inside is not.

1480
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:58,710
The window was just glued on.

1481
01:14:58,710 --> 01:15:01,410
-And, the one who could've done that is... -Hold it.

1482
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:04,810
Right, the very last person who went to Mr. Tokitsu's room...

1483
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:05,910
Mr. Koya.

1484
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:08,320
No one other than you could've done it!

1485
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,120
What're you talking about, Heiji? He's...

1486
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,120
You caught Tokitsu who was taking

1487
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:15,520
his good old time absorbed in the trick off guard,

1488
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,890
hit him and killed him.

1489
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:20,800
No, I hate to interrupt you but...

1490
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,400
Mr. Koya couldn't have carried the trick out.

1491
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,300
I've got proof too.

1492
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:28,300
This screw with the head cut off that I found in Tokitsu's room!

1493
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:30,200
This guy...

1494
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,910
Don't tell me that...

1495
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:42,780
"Green. Message from Heiji" -Well?

1496
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:43,990
"Green. Message from Heiji" -This is what you call

1497
01:15:43,990 --> 01:15:45,690
"Green. Message from Heiji" -conclusive evidence!

1498
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:49,990
I guess you couldn't retrieve all of them.

1499
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:55,660
Right!

1500
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:57,970
You never know where the screw would fly off to

1501
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:00,070
if you cut them with pliers.

1502
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:05,270
Just as I thought.

1503
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:07,580
So, it was you

1504
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:09,980
who killed Tokitsu after all.

1505
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:17,090
Hattori.

1506
01:16:17,090 --> 01:16:20,590
Tokitsu said that it would take him an hour to prepare the trick,

1507
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:22,890
because he included the time for the glue to dry.

1508
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:25,760
No matter how quickly he removed the screws and cut them,

1509
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:30,870
even for instant glue to dry, it would take over 30 minutes.

1510
01:16:30,870 --> 01:16:32,970
In other words, Tokitsu had planned to finish

1511
01:16:32,970 --> 01:16:35,170
what he had to in less than 30 minutes

1512
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:37,870
and wait outside for the glue to dry.

1513
01:16:37,870 --> 01:16:42,180
So, the person who could kill Tokitsu who was still in his room

1514
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:44,080
is the one who got up right after dinner started.

1515
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,580
You're the only one who could've done it!

1516
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:48,980
You probably faked going to the restroom

1517
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:50,690
and headed for Tokitsu's room.

1518
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:52,290
You probably told him that you also figured out the trick

1519
01:16:52,290 --> 01:16:55,790
so you wanted to compare answers and went inside.

1520
01:16:55,790 --> 01:16:58,860
You caught him off guard and killed him.

1521
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:01,060
Then, you completed the trick that he was working on

1522
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:03,060
and created the locked room.

1523
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:04,570
You then entered from the front door

1524
01:17:04,570 --> 01:17:06,870
and came back to the dining room where we were,

1525
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:09,470
as if nothing happened. That's it!

1526
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:13,880
But, this is based on the assumption that you could've done it.

1527
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:15,580
There's no proof.

1528
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:20,280
That's why I used the screw of the wireless radio that was in the shed.

1529
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:21,580
Even if you know that you picked all the screws up,

1530
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:26,990
me showing you this would make you anxious, right?

1531
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:30,490
Moreover, Mr. Koya is suspected, and once you think it's not yourself,

1532
01:17:30,490 --> 01:17:32,460
you inevitably go off guard.

1533
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:34,560
I figured you would look towards the place you hid the screws,

1534
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,760
so I kept watching you,

1535
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:40,270
but I didn't think you keep them on you, in your pocket.

1536
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:42,770
It surprised me...

1537
01:17:44,670 --> 01:17:46,870
seeing you counting them.

1538
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:51,780
Well, you pretended to be afraid of the thunder and picked one up,

1539
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:55,080
so I figured you had one on you.

1540
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,690
You knew we were checking the shed.

1541
01:17:57,690 --> 01:17:59,290
You weren't afraid of thunder,

1542
01:17:59,290 --> 01:18:02,490
but rather, it's proof that you were watching outside.

1543
01:18:03,390 --> 01:18:05,060
You bent down then to pick up the screw

1544
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:08,260
that you failed to pick up previously, right?

1545
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:12,770
Am I wrong?

1546
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:15,170
Oh, that's probably...

1547
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:20,480
To hide the hole for your pierced ear.

1548
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,580
You covered your ears to hide it, right?

1549
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:24,180
Huh, pierce...

1550
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:25,580
But...

1551
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:28,180
That's why you were wearing a headphone on the ship, right?

1552
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:29,580
Because if your hair blew in the sea breeze,

1553
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,190
it would reveal your pierced ears.

1554
01:18:31,190 --> 01:18:34,990
Well, there are a lot of students with pierced ears in England,

1555
01:18:34,990 --> 01:18:36,890
so I didn't even bother to notice.

1556
01:18:36,890 --> 01:18:39,360
But, I thought your high school was really strict

1557
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:42,260
that you could never be allowed pierced ears.

1558
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:44,470
Yes, but it's okay already.

1559
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:46,070
I'm already 20,

1560
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:48,870
and I've graduated high school two years ago.

1561
01:18:48,870 --> 01:18:52,870
I took my old uniform out to hide what I could,

1562
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:54,580
but goofed.

1563
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:56,480
I even went as far as to talk about school rules

1564
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,980
so that I would look like a high school girl.

1565
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:02,580
But, why did you gather us high school detectives

1566
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:04,790
and do something like this?

1567
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:10,090
I wanted to find out about something.

1568
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:11,660
And, what's that?

1569
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:15,360
The homicide at Lavender Manor.

1570
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,870
You wanted to know who the high school detective that solved it was, right?

1571
01:19:17,870 --> 01:19:19,170
Yes.

1572
01:19:19,170 --> 01:19:23,670
Then, you mean it was... Tokitsu?

1573
01:19:23,670 --> 01:19:28,180
Although the name and details of the case wasn't written in the papers.

1574
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:31,480
Yes, he happened to drop by at the mansion

1575
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,580
while traveling through Shikoku,

1576
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:37,890
solved the locked room case and left without saying his name.

1577
01:19:37,890 --> 01:19:38,990
Because of him,

1578
01:19:38,990 --> 01:19:42,890
my best friend who was working as a housekeeper there was suspected.

1579
01:19:42,890 --> 01:19:43,990
She was suspected on the grounds

1580
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:48,260
that she was with the lady of the house, just two of them together.

1581
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:52,870
I also went to that mansion as a detective,

1582
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:55,770
a month before that man appeared.

1583
01:19:55,770 --> 01:19:58,770
My best friend asked me to investigate the case

1584
01:19:58,770 --> 01:20:01,080
because it could be a homicide.

1585
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:11,290
But, I couldn't come up with anything.

1586
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:13,790
I couldn't think of anything other than the fact that

1587
01:20:13,790 --> 01:20:17,560
she had locked herself in her room and committed suicide.

1588
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:21,960
Then, why was your best friend suspected?

1589
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:25,570
The high school detective that came two months later

1590
01:20:25,570 --> 01:20:28,470
found outside the window of her room

1591
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:30,770
scattered screws with heads cut off

1592
01:20:30,770 --> 01:20:36,480
as well as the fact that the window was only pasted on with glue.

1593
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,780
You mean you overlooked it?

1594
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:40,580
Overlooked it my foot.

1595
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:42,180
The man called Tsuchio

1596
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:44,390
disguised himself as a cleaning staff

1597
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:46,690
and set up the trick.

1598
01:20:46,690 --> 01:20:50,290
He probably rigged the window so that it would come off easily,

1599
01:20:50,290 --> 01:20:53,760
when he planned to come back to rob the house later.

1600
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,960
That's why when you heard of the Lavender Manor,

1601
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,970
you went pale and wanted to escape from the island.

1602
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:03,070
Six months after the incident,

1603
01:21:03,070 --> 01:21:05,370
Tokitsu jumps onto the trick,

1604
01:21:05,370 --> 01:21:07,480
as if to boast his power of deduction,

1605
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:11,080
reports to the police and the media that this is a homicide.

1606
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:12,380
"New Truth Disclosed on Suicide of the Lady of Lavender Manor"

1607
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:13,880
"Police Conclude it to be Locked Room Homicide!"

1608
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,280
"Suspect Still Denies Charges"

1609
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:18,190
If the rust of the screws were checked,

1610
01:21:18,190 --> 01:21:19,390
it would've been obvious whether it had anything

1611
01:21:19,390 --> 01:21:21,390
to do with the case or not.

1612
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:24,090
Tokitsu, realized that something was not right,

1613
01:21:24,090 --> 01:21:26,460
so he didn't disclose his name.

1614
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:30,770
That's why I couldn't tell which high school detective it was.

1615
01:21:30,770 --> 01:21:32,470
The only clue I had

1616
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:36,470
was the message that my best friend left me before she died.

1617
01:21:36,470 --> 01:21:38,670
A high school detective that speaks with a strange accent

1618
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:40,370
suspects me.

1619
01:21:40,370 --> 01:21:43,080
Help me. Help me, Natsuki!

1620
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,080
That's all she left behind.

1621
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:55,190
I see.

1622
01:21:55,190 --> 01:21:57,190
"A strange accent"

1623
01:21:57,190 --> 01:21:59,460
Since I've been living abroad for a while,

1624
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:01,960
sometimes my Japanese is funny.

1625
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,170
Hattori speaks with a super Kansai accent,

1626
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:06,370
and Tokitsu talks in old Japanese.

1627
01:22:06,370 --> 01:22:08,670
That's why you gathered us all here.

1628
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:10,370
Yes, moreover,

1629
01:22:10,370 --> 01:22:15,280
only you three had strong connections with the police too.

1630
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:19,680
Which means that Kudo wasn't included to begin with?

1631
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:20,780
Okay.

1632
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:24,190
Yes, I just used his name to call Hakuba over

1633
01:22:24,190 --> 01:22:26,690
because Kudo is famous.

1634
01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:29,790
And, at this lodge where you gathered all the detectives,

1635
01:22:29,790 --> 01:22:32,360
you first put Mr. Tsuchio to sleep and tied him up,

1636
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:36,360
created a locked room just like the one at Lavender Manor

1637
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,170
and got hold of the target you were after.

1638
01:22:39,170 --> 01:22:43,170
Yes, if I put the necessary tools in the room

1639
01:22:43,270 --> 01:22:45,970
filled with the fragrance of lavender,

1640
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:49,880
the high school detective would recall the case immediately

1641
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:52,380
and see through the trick.

1642
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:57,590
That mansion was really virtually buried in lavender.

1643
01:22:57,590 --> 01:22:58,890
Isn't that right,

1644
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:02,290
Mr. Renzo Koya who used to work as the steward of that mansion?

1645
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:11,670
Yes, because the lady of the house loved them very much.

1646
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:16,970
Miss!

1647
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:22,780
Then, why did you call him here?

1648
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:25,280
He knew why the lady of the house committed suicide

1649
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:26,480
and yet he didn't say a word about it.

1650
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:28,580
That's because...

1651
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:30,890
Miss, please don't take anymore medicine!

1652
01:23:30,890 --> 01:23:34,790
Quiet, let me do as I please!

1653
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:37,860
I couldn't say a word

1654
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:40,860
to protect the honor of the lady of the house.

1655
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:42,660
I thought that suspicion against her

1656
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:44,970
would clear as investigations progressed.

1657
01:23:44,970 --> 01:23:45,970
"Suspect of Locked Room Murder Commits Suicide"

1658
01:23:45,970 --> 01:23:48,870
I never imagined something like that would happen.

1659
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:52,070
Please accept my apologies.

1660
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:54,380
But... hold it.

1661
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:57,580
If you called these two here that you have a grudge against...

1662
01:23:57,580 --> 01:24:00,780
Right, nobody will come for you.

1663
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:02,480
Back then, I told the captain of the ship that

1664
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:03,880
if he can't keep a secret,

1665
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:05,290
I'm not going to pay him the remainder,

1666
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:07,690
to make sure he wouldn't talk.

1667
01:24:07,690 --> 01:24:10,390
I couldn't afford having him run away on me,

1668
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:12,960
even if he were to realize what my plan was.

1669
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,260
I had that in mind too.

1670
01:24:15,260 --> 01:24:19,170
As for Tokitsu, he kept explaining his mistaken deduction

1671
01:24:19,170 --> 01:24:23,570
of the murder at Lavender Manor up to the time he was killed by me.

1672
01:24:23,570 --> 01:24:25,770
He was really someone not worth bothering with.

1673
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:28,380
So, you're the one who broke the wireless radio too.

1674
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:30,680
Of course I'm the one who broke it.

1675
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:33,080
We all die together.

1676
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:37,590
I'm sorry, sonny.

1677
01:24:37,590 --> 01:24:39,890
No need to apologize!

1678
01:24:39,890 --> 01:24:43,690
They'll come to save us, I know!

1679
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:50,360
You said that you came here a half day earlier than us, right?

1680
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:53,070
Didn't you come here with your own cruiser?

1681
01:24:53,070 --> 01:24:54,670
No, I just happened to arrive

1682
01:24:54,670 --> 01:24:57,670
earlier than scheduled at the harbor.

1683
01:24:57,670 --> 01:24:59,870
I heard that it was a lodge that was not in use for a while

1684
01:24:59,870 --> 01:25:02,780
and that I was going to be sleeping together with many people so...

1685
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:06,480
I looked for a ship that recently shipped daily necessities and food

1686
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:07,780
to an uninhabited island,

1687
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:09,980
and had them bring me here,

1688
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:12,190
after paying a hefty sum of money.

1689
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:16,190
Which means that nobody knows you're here?

1690
01:25:16,290 --> 01:25:19,760
No, and how about you, haven't you told anybody?

1691
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,060
Well, I sort of did, but...

1692
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:24,270
She's kind of dense.

1693
01:25:24,270 --> 01:25:25,970
What?

1694
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:29,970
A sound?

1695
01:25:29,970 --> 01:25:32,170
What's this sound?

1696
01:25:33,370 --> 01:25:36,080
Don't tell me that the generator also broke down.

1697
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,480
It's not the sound of the generator!

1698
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,380
Then, what's this sound?

1699
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:47,890
Heiji!

1700
01:25:49,490 --> 01:25:51,060
It's Kazuha!

1701
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:53,460
Kazuha brought a ship along!

1702
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:54,660
Why?

1703
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:59,370
Heiji left a message and landmark behind.

1704
01:25:59,370 --> 01:26:04,270
Yeah, I leave a message saying "Heiji Hattori was here!"

1705
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:14,780
Oh, there he is! It's Heiji and Conan too!

1706
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:17,690
Really, it's Heiji!

1707
01:26:17,690 --> 01:26:20,590
God, if you spit it out right away,

1708
01:26:20,590 --> 01:26:23,790
you wouldn't have had to take on five throws over the shoulder.

1709
01:26:23,790 --> 01:26:25,260
It was six.

1710
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:26,760
What?

1711
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:34,070
I'm glad there are hot-blooded detectives like you around.

1712
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:36,870
I smear the door knob with blood and you break the door down,

1713
01:26:36,870 --> 01:26:39,170
then you crack the glass window and break in.

1714
01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:43,180
Thanks to you, the dead body ends up leaning against the window.

1715
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:45,780
If you charge forward body and all and the entire window falls off,

1716
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:47,180
that's it.

1717
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:50,380
Sorry, that I'm so hot tempered and rash.

1718
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:53,990
Nope, to believe that a person is alive

1719
01:26:53,990 --> 01:26:56,390
till you confirm the person's death

1720
01:26:56,390 --> 01:26:59,360
is what a famed detective is all about.

1721
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:01,060
Right, sonny?

1722
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:09,170
If god would allow me to...

1723
01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:13,170
I would really have liked to have a Detective Championship

1724
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:15,280
with both of you.

1725
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:22,080
If I could only go back to my high school days without worry.

1726
01:28:48,570 --> 01:28:51,870
And? Is Kudo there?

1727
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:55,180
I'm not sure.

1728
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:59,680
Of course he's not.

1729
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,600
Next Conan's Hint:

1730
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:05,900
Local newspaper.

1731
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:08,640
-Haibara, where is your home town? -Doc's place.

1732
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:10,420
-No way. -Indeed.

1733
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:11,460
Yeah.
