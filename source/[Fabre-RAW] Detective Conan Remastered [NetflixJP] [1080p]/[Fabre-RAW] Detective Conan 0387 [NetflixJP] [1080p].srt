1
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,030
The strings play a murderous tone.

2
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,830
Annoying human relationships.

3
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,630
Harmonic tones echo and the case is solved.

4
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,230
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,030
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,130
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,117
We were summoned by Ms. Hasuki Shitara

8
00:01:59,117 --> 00:02:02,217
and went to visit Choichiro Shitara's residence. Pops, Ran and I.

9
00:02:03,217 --> 00:02:04,717
Hasuki had called us

10
00:02:04,717 --> 00:02:06,117
because incomprehensible accidents

11
00:02:06,117 --> 00:02:07,717
revolving around the famed musical instrument Stradivarius

12
00:02:07,717 --> 00:02:09,917
have been occurring consecutively from the year before last.

13
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:11,717
Her request was for us to investigate these accidents.

14
00:02:13,317 --> 00:02:15,117
However, as soon as we got there,

15
00:02:15,117 --> 00:02:17,017
the annex went up in flames!

16
00:02:17,017 --> 00:02:19,817
Genzaburo who was inside, dies.

17
00:02:20,817 --> 00:02:22,517
Moreover, that night,

18
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,517
while Kyosuke was playing the Requiem on his violin,

19
00:02:25,517 --> 00:02:29,117
Ayane falls from the 3rd floor to her death.

20
00:02:29,117 --> 00:02:32,517
Left behind are a violin and several traces of things.

21
00:02:32,517 --> 00:02:34,017
What is going on...

22
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:43,717
"Cacophony of Stradivarius! Postlude!"

23
00:02:52,517 --> 00:02:55,717
That's no doubt the bridge of a violin.

24
00:02:55,717 --> 00:03:01,117
But, the bridge was on the replica as well as the Stradivarius.

25
00:03:01,117 --> 00:03:02,317
Which means...

26
00:03:02,317 --> 00:03:05,017
there was one more violin.

27
00:03:06,717 --> 00:03:08,717
And one more thing.

28
00:03:08,717 --> 00:03:11,017
There was something that looked like the tip of a chopstick.

29
00:03:11,017 --> 00:03:12,617
And that was...

30
00:03:12,617 --> 00:03:14,217
a tact.

31
00:03:14,217 --> 00:03:16,017
The conductor's staff used in an orchestra.

32
00:03:16,017 --> 00:03:19,517
Yeah, we found something that looked to be the burnt remains of a case.

33
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:22,817
Right, shaped something like this,

34
00:03:22,817 --> 00:03:25,417
and maybe two thin sticks would fit into it.

35
00:03:25,417 --> 00:03:28,117
Which means that there was nothing in the case, right?

36
00:03:31,317 --> 00:03:33,217
So that's the story.

37
00:03:34,217 --> 00:03:36,617
But, there is one thing I don't understand...

38
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:40,317
What is the killer so hung up on?

39
00:03:41,617 --> 00:03:44,117
Come to think of it, Mom told me some time in the past...

40
00:03:48,117 --> 00:03:50,017
"Do-Do-Re-Mi-Mi-So"

41
00:03:50,017 --> 00:03:51,717
"Mi-Mi-Re-Re-Do"

42
00:03:51,717 --> 00:03:53,617
"Do-Do-Re-Mi-Mi-So"

43
00:03:53,617 --> 00:03:55,617
"Mi-Mi-Re-Re-Do"

44
00:03:55,617 --> 00:03:57,517
"Do-Do-Re-Mi-Mi-So"

45
00:03:57,517 --> 00:03:59,417
"Mi-Mi-Re-Re-Do"

46
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:03,717
Why do I spread my fingers out when I play the piano?

47
00:04:03,717 --> 00:04:05,817
Well...

48
00:04:05,817 --> 00:04:08,317
There's this thing called a chord.

49
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:10,017
For example...

50
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:11,817
This is the "C" chord.

51
00:04:13,617 --> 00:04:15,117
This is "D".

52
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:17,917
This is "E".

53
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:18,917
Okay...

54
00:04:23,217 --> 00:04:27,117
Well? Doesn't this chord make you feel sort of uncomfortable?

55
00:04:38,617 --> 00:04:42,317
Inspector, it's suicide, suicide.

56
00:04:42,317 --> 00:04:47,917
The entrance door and the door of the storeroom were both locked up.

57
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:49,517
In such a locked room, it's impossible.

58
00:04:49,517 --> 00:04:53,117
If Ayane used the chair as a step and jumped out

59
00:04:53,117 --> 00:04:55,117
the only thing thinkable is suicide.

60
00:04:55,117 --> 00:04:58,017
Then, doesn't it bother you

61
00:04:58,017 --> 00:05:01,117
that people with the initials in keeping

62
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:04,417
with the musical scale, D-E-F-G-A have died.

63
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:07,317
It's true that before the "A" of Ayane

64
00:05:07,317 --> 00:05:10,617
comes Genzaburo's "G". But, it's probably just a coincidence.

65
00:05:10,617 --> 00:05:12,817
That room was locked too,

66
00:05:12,817 --> 00:05:15,717
and the fire was probably caused by him falling asleep while smoking.

67
00:05:15,717 --> 00:05:17,417
But...

68
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,517
At any rate, I think we should call it a day...

69
00:05:24,217 --> 00:05:25,617
Dad.

70
00:05:28,017 --> 00:05:30,617
What is it, Ran? What?

71
00:05:30,617 --> 00:05:34,317
Well, after yawning and making a funny looking face,

72
00:05:34,317 --> 00:05:36,417
you fall asleep and start your deduction show.

73
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:38,217
A funny looking face?

74
00:05:38,217 --> 00:05:42,217
Right, right, and you also make strange sounds

75
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,517
like "hanyah" or whatever.

76
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:45,417
I thought it sounded more like "Hohee"?

77
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:48,517
No, I think it was "Henyo" the other day.

78
00:05:54,017 --> 00:05:56,817
Right, right, it's this face, this voice!

79
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:02,417
The Sleeping Kogoro.

80
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:05,417
He's sure putting on a haughty pose today.

81
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:06,717
Of course,

82
00:06:06,717 --> 00:06:08,617
because after all I solved the mystery that even you, Inspector,

83
00:06:08,617 --> 00:06:10,817
could not solve despite all your thinking.

84
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:17,217
The truth of what has been happening here at this house from two years ago.

85
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:21,017
But you kept insisting that it was suicide till just a while ago.

86
00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:24,617
Well, it was an instant flash of inspiration.

87
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:29,217
Please gather the things I ask for here.

88
00:06:29,217 --> 00:06:32,717
After everything's ready please call the four suspects here.

89
00:06:32,717 --> 00:06:33,917
And of course, please don't forget

90
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:36,417
that famed musical instrument, the Stradivarius.

91
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:38,617
Okay, what do we bring for you.

92
00:06:38,617 --> 00:06:42,417
No, Officer Takagi, please wait for us in another room.

93
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:43,417
Why?

94
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:45,517
You'll find out later.

95
00:06:45,517 --> 00:06:48,217
Don't come out until I call you, all right?

96
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:56,917
So, you've figured out who the killer is?

97
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:00,117
Which means you think this is a serial murder case?

98
00:07:00,117 --> 00:07:03,617
Are you referring to Great Uncle Genzaburo and Grandmother Ayane too?

99
00:07:03,617 --> 00:07:08,617
Yes, they are all victims that have been killed by one person.

100
00:07:08,617 --> 00:07:12,617
It is most likely that Eimi who tripped over the stairs

101
00:07:13,617 --> 00:07:16,317
and Furuto who fell to his death from the veranda

102
00:07:16,317 --> 00:07:17,617
were also killed by the same person.

103
00:07:17,617 --> 00:07:20,017
"Hasuki Shitara (23), Choichiro's granddaughter" -Oh no.

104
00:07:20,017 --> 00:07:22,117
"Choichiro Shitara (72)" -Why would this Stradivarius

105
00:07:22,117 --> 00:07:24,417
have anything to do with solving the mystery?

106
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:26,617
He's probably figured out who it is was

107
00:07:26,617 --> 00:07:28,717
"Benio Tsumagari (54), Steward" that switched the violin with a replica

108
00:07:28,717 --> 00:07:31,417
then came back here just to return the violin.

109
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,717
No. I thought I'd like you to listen to a song I will play

110
00:07:34,717 --> 00:07:37,217
before starting my deduction show.

111
00:07:37,217 --> 00:07:38,517
In other words, a prelude to solving the mystery,

112
00:07:38,517 --> 00:07:40,317
I guess you could say.

113
00:07:42,517 --> 00:07:44,017
Dad?

114
00:07:44,017 --> 00:07:48,917
Yes, just like I did in front of you a while ago.

115
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:50,417
Are you ready?

116
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:56,817
Well... I don't think you should.

117
00:07:56,817 --> 00:07:58,117
Of course you shouldn't.

118
00:07:58,117 --> 00:08:00,917
Just what do you think my Stradivarius is?

119
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:02,017
Just what do you intend to do

120
00:08:02,017 --> 00:08:04,317
if an amateur like you handles it and scratches it or something

121
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,817
Well, well, let's see what he wants to do.

122
00:08:07,817 --> 00:08:10,417
I'm sure he has something in mind.

123
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:13,017
Or, is there some reason why you don't want to let him have it,

124
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:14,917
Uncle Choichiro.

125
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:18,717
No, I don't. Here...

126
00:08:20,617 --> 00:08:23,517
I'm all ears...

127
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:31,217
So, it was you after all, wasn't it, Kyosuke?

128
00:08:31,217 --> 00:08:33,517
You're the one who switched the violin.

129
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:39,317
Hey, hey, I just handed it over to you

130
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:41,017
because you said you wanted to play it.

131
00:08:41,017 --> 00:08:43,017
If I remember correctly,

132
00:08:43,017 --> 00:08:46,617
the people who handled this violin was in the order as follows.

133
00:08:46,617 --> 00:08:50,617
Kyosuke tuned the violin this afternoon

134
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:53,017
and handed it over to Hasuki.

135
00:08:53,017 --> 00:08:55,517
When she was showing me the violin

136
00:08:55,517 --> 00:08:57,217
fire breaks out at the annex.

137
00:08:59,317 --> 00:09:02,517
The Stradivarius that was left on the table

138
00:09:02,517 --> 00:09:04,617
was taken to the storeroom by Ms. Tsumagari.

139
00:09:05,617 --> 00:09:07,317
If the one who switched the violins were either

140
00:09:07,317 --> 00:09:12,417
Ms. Tsumagari or Choichiro who could go in and out of the storeroom,

141
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:15,217
it would have been switched after I played

142
00:09:15,217 --> 00:09:17,717
the violin in Hasuki's room.

143
00:09:17,717 --> 00:09:20,517
If my fingerprints are found on the violin,

144
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:22,017
either one of the two

145
00:09:22,017 --> 00:09:23,517
would've been the one who switched the violin.

146
00:09:24,617 --> 00:09:29,917
If so, that person would've let me touch the Stradivarius one more time

147
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:33,817
in order to make unknown when my fingerprints got on the violin.

148
00:09:33,817 --> 00:09:36,317
If it were Kyosuke or Hasuki that did the switch,

149
00:09:36,317 --> 00:09:37,917
it would be the same.

150
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:40,717
They would want me to touch it here.

151
00:09:40,717 --> 00:09:43,617
If my prints are not found on that genuine violin,

152
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:48,017
it would mean that it had been switched to the replica before I played it,

153
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:50,917
and both of you would be suspected.

154
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:52,817
However, Hasuki and...

155
00:09:52,817 --> 00:09:55,517
Choichiro, as well as Ms. Tsumagari

156
00:09:55,517 --> 00:09:59,117
objected to my touching the Stradivarius.

157
00:09:59,117 --> 00:10:01,217
But, you urged me to go ahead.

158
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:03,117
In other words, Kyosuke...

159
00:10:03,117 --> 00:10:05,617
this is evidence that you are

160
00:10:05,617 --> 00:10:08,217
the one who had committed the serial murders.

161
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:12,217
Great Uncle... Oh, no...

162
00:10:12,217 --> 00:10:15,117
But, it could be that when Kyosuke was tuning the violin,

163
00:10:15,117 --> 00:10:17,317
it was already the replica.

164
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:18,817
That's not possible.

165
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:21,817
With an ear like his...

166
00:10:24,617 --> 00:10:27,517
He would know right off the bat that it's not genuine.

167
00:10:27,517 --> 00:10:31,517
Well... But what makes you say he's the murderer?

168
00:10:31,517 --> 00:10:34,017
Ayane's room was locked, and besides...

169
00:10:34,017 --> 00:10:38,117
Genzaburo's room that caught fire was also locked.

170
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:40,617
Hey, kid, show them the stuff.

171
00:10:41,817 --> 00:10:43,317
Okay! Here it is...

172
00:10:43,317 --> 00:10:46,417
It's the metal piece that was found in Genzaburo's room.

173
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,617
Take a good look, Inspector,

174
00:10:53,617 --> 00:10:56,517
only the hole on the top part is bent.

175
00:10:56,517 --> 00:10:59,217
If the locked door was destroyed and forced open,

176
00:10:59,217 --> 00:11:02,017
the top and bottom should be bent out of shape.

177
00:11:03,017 --> 00:11:04,517
True.

178
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,717
When he found that the firefighter was saying,

179
00:11:11,717 --> 00:11:13,917
that the bolt sticking out of the door,

180
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:16,017
the top part is the knob and the bottom part is the lock.

181
00:11:16,017 --> 00:11:19,117
So from the looks of the direction in which the door was opened,

182
00:11:19,117 --> 00:11:22,217
it doesn't seem to have been locked when it was broken down.

183
00:11:22,217 --> 00:11:24,917
But, when we went back to the burnt remains later

184
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:28,317
the door key was locked.

185
00:11:28,317 --> 00:11:31,317
Kyosuke locked it.

186
00:11:32,617 --> 00:11:35,817
Back then he pretended that the door was locked

187
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:37,317
and broke it down.

188
00:11:37,317 --> 00:11:39,417
No good, it's locked!

189
00:11:42,217 --> 00:11:46,117
When we were all distracted by the sea of flames...

190
00:11:47,817 --> 00:11:49,717
I see.

191
00:11:49,717 --> 00:11:53,717
But what has that to do with switching the violin?

192
00:11:53,717 --> 00:11:58,417
He used it to make Ayane jump to her death from this room.

193
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,917
What do you mean?

194
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:02,817
But he was in the room downstairs at that time, wasn't he?

195
00:12:02,817 --> 00:12:05,117
It was also a trap

196
00:12:05,117 --> 00:12:08,317
to lure Ayane to the window.

197
00:12:08,317 --> 00:12:10,317
Try to imagine...

198
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:13,817
The Stradivarius that she used to stare at every night

199
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,617
as if it were her son is switched for a replica.

200
00:12:15,617 --> 00:12:17,817
Outraged, she destroys the violin.

201
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:20,217
Can you imagine how she felt.

202
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:24,617
She then turns to look towards the window

203
00:12:24,617 --> 00:12:27,217
and listens to the beautiful melody played by Kyosuke.

204
00:12:28,217 --> 00:12:30,917
Hey, kid, show them the other stuff next!

205
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:31,917
Yes, sir!

206
00:12:45,817 --> 00:12:48,517
Mr. Mouri, this is...

207
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,317
What is the meaning of this?

208
00:12:50,317 --> 00:12:55,017
This is what Ayane saw back then.

209
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,760
Don't tell me that Ayane thought that was the real Stradivarius.

210
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:12,360
Yeah, more so, if the Requiem played by Kyosuke

211
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,260
from the floor below sounds like the genuine Stradivarius.

212
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,860
She used the chair as a stepping stool and climbed up the window,

213
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,960
trying to take the violin...

214
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,060
But, I wonder if she'd fall down so easily.

215
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,360
Let me show you how it was done.

216
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,560
Hey, kid, go get Officer Takagi.

217
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,260
Okay!

218
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,360
-Then, Ms. Tsumagari... -Yes, sir.

219
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,160
you took the real Stradivarius to the storeroom.

220
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,760
Did you call me?

221
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,560
Officer Takagi, while Pops was explaining the trick to everyone,

222
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,560
a Stradivarius happen to be hanging out the window.

223
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,160
-What? -Since you're tall, you can reach it, right?

224
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,360
Well... I guess so...

225
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,360
I hope there's nothing behind all this?

226
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,860
No, no... but be extremely careful will you,

227
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,260
because it's valued at more than several billions of yen.

228
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,460
But, mind you it's not my fault if I drop it.

229
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,060
Hey, hey...

230
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,260
Watch out!

231
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,260
Be careful, Takagi!

232
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,860
It moved.

233
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,260
When I tried to take the violin, it moved away.

234
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,860
I see, a pole was attached to the window frame on both sides,

235
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,860
then the violin is suspended with a string.

236
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,760
Then the more the window is opened,

237
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,160
the farther the violin pulls away.

238
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,560
But, Dad...

239
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,460
What if it gets stuck like that?

240
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,960
There was no violin or pole anywhere at the site.

241
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,060
This is a temporary gimmick that I made

242
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,160
by borrowing a long chopstick from the kitchen.

243
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,760
If the two sticks that were used to carry out the crime

244
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,260
were the conductor's staff that was stolen from Genzaburo's room,

245
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,960
they would be very flexible,

246
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,760
so the violin that moves to the edge

247
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,260
will eventually fall from its weight.

248
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,660
Therefore, if the other string that is attached to the violin

249
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,460
is stuck on to the window frame of the room below,

250
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,660
after we ran over to Ayane who we were looking down upon,

251
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,160
he secretly went to collect the violin.

252
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,960
But, the staff would still...

253
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,260
That too...

254
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,060
since it was only stuck on using scotch tape,

255
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,760
all he had to do was attach a string to it

256
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,160
to collect it later.

257
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,960
The sound that we heard before Ayane fell,

258
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,660
is the sound of that violin bumping into the wall...

259
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,960
As proof of that,

260
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,560
a broken staff was found near the corpse.

261
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,160
He set up this gimmick

262
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,860
when he came into this room to tune the Stradivarius.

263
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,060
This is probably when he switched the genuine one

264
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,660
for the replica too.

265
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,460
I'm sure that the conductor's staff

266
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,660
and violin that he collected are hidden somewhere in the room below.

267
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,360
Of course, with Kyosuke's fingerprints all over it.

268
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,760
It's hard to believe that he had time to erase his fingerprints

269
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,560
or to take the things to another place back then

270
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,860
since Hasuki, who broke out in tears was there.

271
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,160
It can't be... That's all baloney!

272
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,460
Uncle Kyosuke can't be the killer,

273
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,160
because he saved Grandmother

274
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,060
who couldn't make it out of the fire in time.

275
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,660
If so, then why?

276
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,460
That's because of the rule of the "musical scale"

277
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,460
that even you know of as a musician.

278
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,660
Why do I spread my fingers out when I play the piano?

279
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,360
Because see, when you play notes that are alongside each other...

280
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,860
Cacophony.

281
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,960
When notes that are alongside each other are played

282
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,160
it sounds disharmonic...

283
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,660
Don't tell me that...

284
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,860
Exactly.

285
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,260
I couldn't stand the fact that Genzaburo with initial "G"

286
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:09,060
and Grandmother Ayane with initial "A" die at the same time.

287
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,260
Why you... just what do you take the life of people to be!

288
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,260
I'd like you to say those words to Uncle Choichiro there too.

289
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,760
What?

290
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,160
Thirty years ago, that old man over there who was to blame

291
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,360
for my father getting seriously hurt, and drove my mother to her death

292
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,360
from the heavy load of caring for father.

293
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,760
Thirty years ago.

294
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,960
You mean back when that robbery occurred.

295
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,560
I had completely forgotten about it until two years ago

296
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,860
when I was asked to tune the Stradivarius

297
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,860
during that old man's birthday.

298
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,060
The sound of the, the feel...

299
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,260
it brought back memories of when I was still a child,

300
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,160
of when my father who gave me the violin.

301
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,160
When I confirmed with Aunt Eimi,

302
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,160
she told me with a pale face,

303
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,560
that 30 years ago,

304
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,560
that old man over there borrowed the Stradivarius from Father,

305
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,460
saying that he wanted to make Furuto, his son play it.

306
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,060
The old man who fell in love with the tone,

307
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,360
didn't want to return the violin so,

308
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,760
he exchanged it for a replica that looked exactly alike.

309
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,660
But, father found out right away and they got into an argument.

310
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,160
On top of that, after father fell down the stairs...

311
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,860
he was seriously hurt.

312
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,660
That old man had the nerve to leave father who was seriously hurt as is

313
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,260
and didn't even call an ambulance.

314
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,960
He then told the four who were there the following.

315
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,260
Genzaburo, tie Ayane and me up and you guys go on home!

316
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,760
We're going to make it look as if we were attacked by robbers.

317
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,160
Don't you want to play this famed musical instrument?

318
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,260
If Danjiro dies, this is mine.

319
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,360
I'll lend it to you any time you want.

320
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,660
Aunt Eimi, who told me everything,

321
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,460
was besides herself and left the room...

322
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,860
So you decided to take revenge on the four

323
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,460
who agreed to the scheme back then.

324
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,260
When I saw Aunt Eimi trip over the stairs

325
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,260
and fall to her death like Father,

326
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,860
I took it to be a sign from God.

327
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,960
Starting from my mother Chiha,

328
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,560
my father Danjiro,

329
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,860
Aunt Eimi,

330
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,560
they all died in the order of the musical scale.

331
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,560
And if I lined the initials of the ones who would be dying,

332
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,560
I figured it would begin with "C" and end with "C".

333
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,960
Well, but after pushing Furuto off the veranda a year ago,

334
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,660
I was sort of flustered when I found out

335
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,060
that the last one on the list with initial "C",

336
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,760
Gramps Choichiro was about to die of an illness.

337
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,760
Then, I, who was not at all aware of what took place 30 years ago,

338
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,560
was next in line to be killed after all...

339
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,860
No, in Germany after C-D-E-F-G-A

340
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,060
comes the alphabet "H", it's pronounced "HA".

341
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,860
In other words, it stands for Haga.

342
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,960
Uncle!

343
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,460
Pops told me to do so,

344
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,260
so I told them to wait below with a mat.

345
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,360
Because he said that Kyosuke may commit suicide.

346
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,660
But, if it was initial "H", it could've been Hasuki.

347
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,660
It could've been her turn next.

348
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,960
Since Kyosuke brought the Stradivarius back to this room

349
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,560
I figured it wasn't going to be so.

350
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,760
If Ayane didn't break the replica as she did back then,

351
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,660
it would've been likely that no one would've even noticed

352
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,560
that there was a replica of the Stradivarius at all.

353
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,160
The fact that he came to return the genuine one means

354
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,360
that he wanted to leave the famed,

355
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,460
legendary gift that his father had given him to its rightful owner,

356
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,060
to the one that he had thrown into the same situation

357
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,160
as he was thrown into, when they killed his father...

358
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,460
That is, Hasuki. He wanted to give it to you.

359
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,760
When I asked you about the melody from my cell phone,

360
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,260
you answered "Are you talking about me?"

361
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,960
Are you talking about me?

362
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,760
Can you tell me what the notes are?

363
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,160
H-A-G-A?

364
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,760
If in German would it be pronounced HAGA?

365
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,760
That's right. You've got a good ear too, sonny.

366
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,960
Which means that the notes are Ti-La-So-La?

367
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,160
Hey, Conan...

368
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,260
Do you know of any song that begins with Ti-La-So-La?

369
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:32,760
It could be some sad, yet nostalgic type of music...

370
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,160
If so, it's probably...

371
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,960
this song?

372
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,760
That song...

373
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,560
is The Seven Children, right?

374
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,360
"Crow little crow, why do you cry?"

375
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,960
Right, Conan?

376
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,460
Conan?

377
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,187
Next Conan's Hint:

378
00:24:34,187 --> 00:24:36,487
"Sticking to old ways of making liquor"

379
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:37,687
The next episode takes place in Kagoshima!

380
00:24:37,687 --> 00:24:39,287
Pops, drinks, eats and gets drunk.

381
00:24:39,287 --> 00:24:40,987
What are you going there for, Dad?
