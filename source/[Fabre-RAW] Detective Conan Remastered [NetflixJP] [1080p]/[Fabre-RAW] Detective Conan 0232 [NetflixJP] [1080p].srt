1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,890
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,190
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,990
Today's case occurs in a regular condominium.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,890
There's a twist to the strange accident.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,490
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,490
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,490
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,380
"Was it Murder or an Accident?"

9
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,980
Good grief.

10
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,380
Ran says she's going to see a movie

11
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,280
so she dumps Conan on me.

12
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,780
Think of me as your lucky charm.

13
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,080
What do you mean?

14
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,780
Well, every time you solve a case,

15
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,480
I'm always with you.

16
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,780
You're crazy! It was all just coincidence!

17
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,380
Welcome!

18
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,580
-Are you Mr. Mouri? -Yes.

19
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,980
You must be Mr. Ueda.

20
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,180
-Please sit down. -Thank you.

21
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,380
I'm sorry!

22
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,980
My cigarette... Does it bother you?

23
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,380
Yes.

24
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,980
Hot coffee, please.

25
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,880
Yes, right away.

26
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,480
Actually, it's about a colleague of mine, Dr. Yoshimura.

27
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,980
We both work at the same university hospital.

28
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,480
Are the prank calls still coming?

29
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,980
They seem to getting worse.

30
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,380
At first, a threatening letter arrived.

31
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,780
But lately, threatening telephone calls have been coming in.

32
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,080
When he goes out, he's followed.

33
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,480
He's become a nervous wreck.

34
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,480
I'm so worried he might commit a terrible medical mistake.

35
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,780
I don't blame you for worrying.

36
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,880
Dr. Yoshimura says he doesn't understand

37
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,580
what it's all about either.

38
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,080
I want to hire you to look for the culprit

39
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,980
and find out why he's doing this.

40
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,380
I understand.

41
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,380
You can leave it to Kogoro Mouri!

42
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,580
First off, I think it would help

43
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,780
if I spoke to the victim, Mr. Yoshimura

44
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,880
and got all the details from his personally.

45
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:38,180
I'm going to see if that Dr. Yoshimura is in his room.

46
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,780
Hello, Yoshimura? It's me.

47
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,080
He was in his room.

48
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,280
I'll take you there.

49
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,480
This is the place, Mr. Mouri.

50
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,280
Yoshimura lives in the corner unit on the 5th floor.

51
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,780
Shall we go up?

52
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,380
What was that just now?

53
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,680
This way!

54
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,580
Hey, Conan!

55
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,880
What in the world?

56
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,880
This is...

57
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,180
Pops, call an ambulance!

58
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,380
Right.

59
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,280
-Yoshimura! -What did you say?

60
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,180
Yes, this is Mr. Yoshimura!

61
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,980
Mitsuo Yoshimura!

62
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,380
Yoshimura!

63
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,080
Hey, Yoshimura! Snap out of it!

64
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,780
Yoshimura...

65
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,680
What does this mean?

66
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,580
The deceased is Mitsuo Yoshimura,

67
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,380
a 25 year old male.

68
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,180
He was employed as a doctor at the city's medical university.

69
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,680
The key to his apartment was found in his pocket.

70
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,380
So Mr. Mouri, you were hired by Mr. Yoshimura

71
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,580
and just happened to witness the accident. Is that right?

72
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,980
Yes. According to his friend, Mr. Ueda,

73
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,680
Mr. Yoshimura was apparently being threatened.

74
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,680
I see.

75
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,680
Mr. Yoshimura's apartment is on the 5th floor.

76
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,280
It's the unit at the extreme end.

77
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,380
I guess he fell from his own apartment.

78
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,680
We'll be going to his apartment now.

79
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,680
We may be able to determine how he fell.

80
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,680
I know it's your job

81
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,380
but we really appreciate your cooperation.

82
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,280
It's really no problem.

83
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,580
The situation being as it is.

84
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,180
I'm so sorry about Mr. Yoshimura.

85
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,280
Huh? No one's here either.

86
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,280
For security reasons, we've programmed the elevator

87
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,780
to stop on every floor at night.

88
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,980
I see. But it must be very irritating when you're in a hurry.

89
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,380
It is. That's why the late Mr. Yoshimura

90
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,980
always used the emergency stairs

91
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,580
of the warehouse on the next building when he was in a hurry.

92
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,980
The stairs on the building next door?

93
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,680
He's right.

94
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,080
The distance between his apartment

95
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,180
and the warehouse stairwell is perfectly jumpable.

96
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,680
I warned him several times he shouldn't, but...

97
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,480
5th floor.

98
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,080
Excuse me, officer.

99
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,480
Would it be all right if I changed?

100
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,480
My apartment's on the next floor

101
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,280
if you need me for something.

102
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,380
I think it'll be all right.

103
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,480
When you're done changing,

104
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,180
please come to Mr. Yoshimura's apartment.

105
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,280
Yes, I most certainly will.

106
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,880
"Yoshimura"

107
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,580
It's May, but this year's pretty chilly.

108
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,080
You're so right.

109
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,380
A glass of whiskey and water.

110
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,080
It looks like he was drinking alone.

111
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,080
It seems he didn't feel safe anywhere else

112
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,980
besides the hospital where he worked and this apartment.

113
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,180
Now that you mention it, recently...

114
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,180
Some very suspicious looking men were following him around.

115
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,480
They'd go to his apartment in the middle of the night sometimes.

116
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,280
According to Mr. Ueda,

117
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,680
the threatening phone calls came at all hours, there was no pattern.

118
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,380
This is...

119
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,980
Is the veranda Mr. Yoshimura always used to get in and out?

120
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,180
Yes, that's right.

121
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,880
Mr. Yoshimura kept a pair of sandals here all the time

122
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,880
and came and went through here.

123
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,280
I warned him against it many times.

124
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,680
Inspector. The apartment was locked

125
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,180
and his key was found in his pocket.

126
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,980
On top of that, the lights...

127
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,580
in the room were all on

128
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,380
and there're no signs of a struggle.

129
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,680
It appears the death was accidental,

130
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,980
a result of Mr. Yoshimura's carelessness.

131
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,080
That theory does appear very credible.

132
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,480
A sandal?

133
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,280
How'd it get way over there?

134
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,680
But...

135
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,980
Wait a minute!

136
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,580
It's not the roof.

137
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,580
Which means...

138
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,280
I see.

139
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,480
Thank you very much.

140
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,480
Gosh. So it was a prank call.

141
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,380
"Ueda"

142
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,180
Huh? This door bell's not working.

143
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,780
Mr. Ueda...

144
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,980
Yes?

145
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,480
Mr. Ueda, I'm so thirsty.

146
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,580
May I have some water?

147
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,780
Sure.

148
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,880
No problem. Come on in.

149
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,280
Thanks!

150
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,780
Wait here, sit wherever you want.

151
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,380
Thank you.

152
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,180
You know, Mr. Ueda,

153
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,780
a flower delivery man was just here.

154
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,480
Yes. I think someone played a prank on them.

155
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,880
Really?

156
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,680
What's the matter, kid?

157
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,680
You shouldn't be up there. It's dangerous!

158
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,180
-Come back here. -All right.

159
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,580
Here's some juice.

160
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,880
Thank you.

161
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,880
After you finish that,

162
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,680
let's both go to where Mr. Mouri is waiting.

163
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,080
Okay!

164
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,580
Mr. Ueda, are you hot?

165
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,880
You're perspiring so much.

166
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,480
I perspire easily.

167
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,080
I'm going to the restroom.

168
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,480
Why don't you finish your drink?

169
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,980
Okay.

170
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,780
I wonder what left that mark.

171
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,480
What is this?

172
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,680
There's another other there.

173
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,880
And over there too.

174
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,280
On the bed, table and sofa too.

175
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,280
I see. Now I understand!

176
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,680
Hey. What do you think you're doing?

177
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,780
Well...

178
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,580
I forgot something in the room downstairs.

179
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,180
I'm going to get it!

180
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,780
Good grief!

181
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,680
"Yoshimura"

182
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,580
Hey!

183
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,880
You shouldn't do that. We're still checking the scene.

184
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,580
I'm sorry!

185
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,180
Actually, I came here to give you a message from Mr. Mouri.

186
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,380
From Mr. Mouri?

187
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,380
He said...

188
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,880
Yes...

189
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,580
Yes, I understand!

190
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,980
I'll go right away,

191
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,980
but you mustn't touch anything in this apartment.

192
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,580
Okay!

193
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,980
"No new messages"

194
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,480
I knew it. There's no mistake about it.

195
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,380
Mr. Yoshimura's death wasn't an accident.

196
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,680
He was murdered!

197
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,430
I regret having to say this,

198
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,030
but as Mr. Mouri deduced,

199
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,830
it appears Mr. Yoshimura's death was an accident.

200
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,530
For some reason,

201
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,830
when he tried to jump from his veranda to the warehouse,

202
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,530
he must have tripped.

203
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,730
How unfortunate.

204
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,530
Just when you were coming to see him...

205
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,930
Mr. Ueda.

206
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,930
Didn't you call him and tell him we were on our way?

207
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,430
-Yes. -Then I wonder why he would go out?

208
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,830
Children shouldn't butt in!

209
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,130
If you're going to bother us, you can wait outside.

210
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,630
All right.

211
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,030
I guess I have no choice.

212
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,930
I'll have to put him to sleep for awhile.

213
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,430
What's wrong, Mr. Mouri?

214
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,230
Inspector, I think it's too soon to leave.

215
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,330
What?

216
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,530
There are several suspicious details that need clearing up

217
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,830
before we dismiss this as a simple accidental death.

218
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:26,730
Mr. Yoshimura's apartment was locked

219
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,230
but the door chain wasn't on.

220
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,230
Don't you think that it's strange

221
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,330
for a man who was being threatened?

222
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,530
-Yes, that's true. -Another thing.

223
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,830
If he was sitting in his living room

224
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,630
having a drink just prior to falling to his death,

225
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:44,630
isn't it strange that all the ice was melted?

226
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,730
Hey, Mr. Mouri. What are you trying to say?

227
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:54,230
Mr. Yoshimura wasn't in his apartment when he fell.

228
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,330
That's ridiculous!

229
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,630
Then, where do you think he was?

230
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,030
The key to that question is Mr. Yoshimura's sandal.

231
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,030
His sandal?

232
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,630
On the victim's foot,

233
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,130
he wore sandals on his left foot

234
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,630
but his right was bare.

235
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,930
The missing side

236
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,530
was on the roof of the warehouse next door

237
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,430
and pretty far in too.

238
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:20,430
Even if he'd tripped while trying to jump to the emergency stairs,

239
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,730
I doubt the sandal would fly all the way there,

240
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,130
he'd have had to fall from above the 5th floor.

241
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,930
I'd guess the roof!

242
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:36,430
But the door to the roof was locked.

243
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,030
Are you sure? Then that means...

244
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,230
If it wasn't from the roof,

245
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,530
then there's only one other place I can think of.

246
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,530
You're not implying...

247
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,830
I am, Inspector.

248
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,030
Mr. Yoshimura didn't fall from his apartment on the 5th floor,

249
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,730
he fell from this apartment on the 6th floor.

250
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,130
Mr. Ueda.

251
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,130
You caused it to happen, didn't you?

252
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,830
That's absolutely absurd!

253
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:06,230
Officer Chiba, will you help me?

254
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,330
Sure.

255
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:10,630
First, move the television to the corner of the room.

256
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,730
Okay.

257
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,430
Is this all right?

258
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,730
Fine.

259
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,530
Next, move the table to the center of the room

260
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:21,530
and put the chairs on both sides.

261
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,830
And finally, move that bed against the wall.

262
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,730
Mr. Mouri, hold it right there.

263
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,730
A bed's too heavy to move.

264
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,230
Just you wait and see.

265
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,430
Huh?

266
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,730
This bed has casters, so it's easy to move.

267
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,630
Now, Inspector,

268
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,330
look at this room carefully.

269
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:43,230
Haven't you seen this exact same setting somewhere before?

270
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:52,830
Everything's set up like Mr. Yoshimura's apartment, #501.

271
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:57,330
Mr. Ueda rearranged his apartment in this manner.

272
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:02,630
He made Mr. Yoshimura think this was his apartment.

273
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,530
But Mr. Mouri, the furniture's not the same.

274
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:06,630
That's right.

275
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,830
But if you were to wake up in dark,

276
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,930
you wouldn't notice right away

277
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:13,030
that you were in someone else's place.

278
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,130
That's how you got Mr. Yoshimura

279
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:18,430
to fall to his death from the window.

280
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,330
Just a minute!

281
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,030
When Yoshimura fell,

282
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,730
I was with you, Mr. Mouri, remember?

283
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,530
That's right.

284
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:31,130
You used me as your alibi.

285
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,930
But if I were with you,

286
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:39,630
how did I make Yoshimura fall? Tell me that.

287
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,530
You knew Mr. Yoshimura had a habit

288
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:44,830
of using the warehouse's emergency stairs,

289
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,030
so you used this fact to stage your trick.

290
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:53,130
You were probably drinking with Mr. Yoshimura in his apartment,

291
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:57,530
drugged him with something that could snap him out of quickly,

292
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,030
just in case something happened.

293
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,530
Something weak like a sleep inducing drug.

294
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,930
After he fell asleep,

295
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,930
you carried him to this apartment and put him on the bed.

296
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,630
Mr. Yoshimura was mentally distraught

297
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,930
and you fooled him into thinking he was in his own apartment,

298
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:19,430
then you left him there and came to meet us at the coffee shop,

299
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,930
where you called and told him those men were coming for him now.

300
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:25,030
And that he should get away from there.

301
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:28,030
And you had an accomplice.

302
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,930
Are you saying he had help?

303
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,130
Inspector Megure.

304
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,430
This man has something to tell us.

305
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,930
My name is Umemoto. I'm a florist.

306
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:41,730
Inspector Megure, this is the accomplice.

307
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,830
Although he didn't realize that he was aiding a murder.

308
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,230
Mr. Umemoto.

309
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:52,830
Please tell everyone what you did here tonight.

310
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,130
All right.

311
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,430
I received an order for flowers

312
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,730
to be delivered to Mr. Ueda in unit 601,

313
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,930
of this condominium tonight at 7 pm.

314
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,430
To this apartment?

315
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:08,130
Yes, I arrived at 7 pm

316
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,630
and I'd been told that the buzzer was out of order

317
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,630
so I should knock when I arrived.

318
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,630
I did as I was instructed and pounded on the door

319
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,230
but no one answered.

320
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,230
So what did you do?

321
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,230
Well, there was nothing I could do,

322
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:26,730
so I made my other deliveries and came back again.

323
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,130
That gentleman over there came to the door

324
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,330
and said that he didn't place any order.

325
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,130
Inspector Megure.

326
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,330
Now, do you understand?

327
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,530
Mr. Ueda's call scared Mr. Yoshimura,

328
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,830
then Mr. Umemoto the florist's timing is perfect

329
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,030
when he knocks on the door.

330
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:48,530
Mr. Yoshimura thinks it is the men who are after him.

331
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:52,030
So he tries to jump to the next building like he always does.

332
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,730
But he's on the 6th floor and he doesn't make it.

333
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,030
Then he falls straight down.

334
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,930
That's ridiculous! You have some imagination!

335
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:11,930
The reason you held Mr. Yoshimura up was

336
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,930
to give yourself an excuse to go back

337
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:17,330
to your apartment rearrange the furniture.

338
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:21,230
That's why you said you wanted to change out of your bloodied sweater.

339
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,730
The reason why you were perspiring

340
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,630
when Conan went to your place

341
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,930
was you'd been moving the furniture all by yourself.

342
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,530
That's a lie! Can you prove any of this?

343
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,930
You want proof?

344
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,630
We have proof.

345
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,430
When you were in the coffee shop,

346
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:41,030
you said you didn't smoke Cigarettes.

347
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,330
And yet, there're cigarettes and an ashtray right there.

348
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,530
Mr. Yoshimura's a smoker.

349
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:51,530
Just in case he woke up before time and wanted a cigarette,

350
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,530
you didn't want him wandering around looking for an ashtray

351
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:56,630
because that would make him realize he wasn't in his own place.

352
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:01,430
That's why you brought one from his' place.

353
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,730
Mr. Yoshimura brought this himself when he came to visit!

354
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,530
It doesn't prove anything!

355
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:11,930
Inspector, please check the incoming calls on that telephone.

356
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,930
Let's see now.

357
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,230
A call came in at 7:15 pm.

358
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:23,230
Mr. Mouri, the number is from a cellular phone.

359
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:27,730
It's probably Mr. Ueda's number.

360
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,630
It's the call he made from the coffee shop.

361
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,430
-I see. -Hey, hold on just one minute!

362
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,830
I called my apartment by mistake that time.

363
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,030
Really?

364
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,930
Then why is your call to Mr. Yoshimura

365
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,330
recorded on his telephone?

366
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:50,230
How did you confirm that Mr. Yoshimura was in the apartment?

367
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,030
You must've been positive that you wouldn't be suspected

368
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,030
since you were with us all along

369
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,930
and you thought his death would be written off

370
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,830
as a simple accident, didn't you?

371
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:02,930
That's why you didn't think we'd ever check his telephone.

372
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,530
Is that true, Mr. Ueda?

373
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,130
The truth is, I bought some stock and lost a lot of money,

374
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,030
Just when I needed money,

375
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:17,230
Yoshimura came to me with a no fail proposition.

376
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,430
His plan was that I'd steal drugs from the university

377
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:23,430
and he'd sell them.

378
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,130
So I did like he said, I got my share of the money

379
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,730
and that tided me over.

380
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:31,230
But then he said that if I didn't do it again,

381
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,630
he threatened to tell the university about me.

382
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,830
I was afraid I'd be dragged in too deep

383
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,130
so I started planning how to get rid of him.

384
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,530
Just about the same time,

385
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:46,330
I heard that he was being threatened by some bad business partners,

386
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,830
so I decided to use that.

387
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,830
Case solved.

388
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:33,230
Pops, you sneezed earlier too.

389
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,430
Are you catching a cold?

390
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:38,130
No, my nose is just itchy, that's all.

391
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,430
As for you,

392
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,230
you'd better not catch a cold and cause us trouble.

393
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,630
I wouldn't talk.

394
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:47,030
Oh, right! Conan! Come with me tomorrow, too.

395
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:49,230
What? You're working tomorrow, too?

396
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,030
You are such a fool!

397
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,330
Somehow whenever you're with me, I have luck!

398
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:57,230
I feel like I could win big at the horse races!

399
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,630
Like that will ever happen.

400
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,340
Next Conan's Hint:

401
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,240
"Sound of the clock"

402
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,420
It's been a while but in the next episode, animals appear.

403
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,620
Sit!

404
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,440
What?
