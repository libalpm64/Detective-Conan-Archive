1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:05,480
Alibis, secret codes, tricks and deals.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,680
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,380
Today's stage is at a party.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,980
The big shots better beware!

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,680
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,580
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,880
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:58,290
"Mysterious Assassin (Part 1)"

9
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,690
"Reception Desk"

10
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,290
I never thought it would be like this.

11
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,790
What a headache.

12
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,290
Here you go, Conan.

13
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,090
Thank you.

14
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,090
There were a lot of people in line,

15
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,190
but see, he let me cut in front of him.

16
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,590
The man over there who are talking to the sumo player.

17
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,690
He's the president of a dye house, isn't he?

18
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,690
You know him, Conan?

19
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,590
No, but look at his fingers.

20
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,690
Fingers?

21
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,790
The color of the dye rubs off not only on the fingers,

22
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,290
but also inside the nails if you dye things everyday.

23
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,190
But the same thing happens to regular workers.

24
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,190
How did you know he was the president?

25
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,790
Compare his right hand and left hand.

26
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,490
His right hand is tanned,

27
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,590
but his left hand is not, right?

28
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,190
Which means he plays golf.

29
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:58,790
He wouldn't be that tanned unless he plays golf often.

30
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,790
An employee wouldn't be able to play too much golf,

31
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,490
so of course, he is the president.

32
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,790
That's right!

33
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,990
Excuse me.

34
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,890
Please give me your autograph, too!

35
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,990
I'm a great fan of Kazekabuto.

36
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,290
I'm Kazeiwato!

37
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,590
I'm very sorry.

38
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,690
I was shocked.

39
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,590
I can't tell sumo and wrestlers apart without their loincloth.

40
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,190
I guess I'll just have to forget about getting his autograph!

41
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,190
Hey, Dad!

42
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,490
It's embarrassing, so stop eating like that.

43
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,290
They're the ones who pushed the party ticket on me

44
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,690
in place of paying detective fees!

45
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,090
I don't want to lose out!

46
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,090
You're Mr. Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?

47
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,290
Yes.

48
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,890
"Yukiko Tanaka (25)" -I am Yukiko Tanaka.

49
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,190
Could you spare me a bit of your time?

50
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,790
Sure, sure! By all means!

51
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,190
We can also get married while we're at it.

52
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,890
Please come this way.

53
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,290
Yes, yes! Anywhere you want me to go, I'll go.

54
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,890
Gosh.

55
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,190
So you're the president of a company?

56
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,190
"Seiji Ishimoto (54)" -Yes.

57
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,190
Our company manufactures precision parts

58
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,390
for aircrafts and computers.

59
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,590
And what can I do for you?

60
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,790
Ms. Tanaka.

61
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,890
Yes.

62
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,490
Actually, the president was blackmailed.

63
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,090
Blackmailed?

64
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,490
"You're not worth being alive.

65
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,090
I'll kill you off for sure!"

66
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,490
Mr. Mouri, we would like you to find the culprit.

67
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,690
Then, Conan, can you tell me about that person over there?

68
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,790
The one to the left.

69
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,090
The person who handed over his name card

70
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,690
seems to be an executive,

71
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,590
and yet he is acting obsequious,

72
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,990
so that man must be some super big shot.

73
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:08,190
I'm guessing him to be from some financially distinguished family.

74
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,690
I don't thinks so.

75
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,790
"Tsuneaki Niikura(32)" -He's probably...

76
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,590
the secretary of some big shot politician.

77
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,490
I wonder?

78
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,590
See that person over there...

79
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,690
Huh?

80
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,690
He seems to be out of place.

81
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,490
He's been watching everyone for some time now.

82
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,890
He doesn't seem to be enjoying the party at all.

83
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,490
What do you think his profession is?

84
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,490
Do you have any idea why such a letter was sent here?

85
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,690
No.

86
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,990
Why don't you report it to the police?

87
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,690
The president doesn't like the police.

88
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,890
Besides, the police won't get serious over the matter

89
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,090
unless something actually happens, right?

90
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,390
Well, it's true to some extent.

91
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,990
But you sure seem to know a lot about the police.

92
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,190
I not only know a lot about the police,

93
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,790
I know a lot about you too, Mr. Mouri.

94
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,590
After all, I'm the one who decided to call you.

95
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,090
You did?

96
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,690
I searched you on the computer

97
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,190
and thought you to be just the right person.

98
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,790
I see.

99
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,790
You'll accept this case, won't you?

100
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,190
All right!

101
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,390
But please be prepared

102
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,890
for me to hang around Mr. Ishimoto day in and day out from now on.

103
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:20,990
Yes.

104
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,990
I'll leave the method of investigation totally up to you.

105
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,690
And I'll be able to hang around with Yukiko, too.

106
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,290
Hi, kid!

107
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,490
How about taking a picture for good memories?

108
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,690
Ran, let's have her take our picture!

109
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,590
Come, hurry!

110
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,290
This way is better!

111
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,190
Okay, here goes.

112
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,790
Now, let's say...

113
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,890
-Cheese! -Cheese!

114
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:53,190
At any rate, I have done nothing to be hated by anyone.

115
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,490
But having lived this long,

116
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,690
I may have hurt someone unwittingly.

117
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,090
However, that is not my fault!

118
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,490
Right...

119
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:11,890
And now, we would like invite one of the guests to share a few words.

120
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,290
Mr. Masao Takada, a member of Japan House of Representatives.

121
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,490
Please come up to the stage.

122
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,090
Mr. Minister, this way please.

123
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,490
See! He was secretary to politician, right?

124
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,890
You're right. Conan, you're something!

125
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:34,190
Well, hello. Thank you.

126
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,990
Isn't it amazing that the light shines directly on the speaker

127
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,090
despite the whole place being dark.

128
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,590
The place he stands is either previously set up

129
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,890
or it's automatically set up that the spotlight shines

130
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,590
on the microphone he has on him.

131
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,890
Why doesn't he go straight to the stage?

132
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:57,090
Maybe he wants to get everyone's attention?

133
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,490
He's gone.

134
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,990
Hi, Mr. Ishimoto. Please excuse us.

135
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,790
I'm sorry, but please excuse me.

136
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,990
What the...

137
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,190
President?

138
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,890
Mr. Niikura...

139
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,190
Huh?

140
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,690
Mr. Takada...

141
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,390
Conan!

142
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,690
Darn it! He sure knows how to run for it.

143
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,290
A terrible thing has happened to Mr. Takada.

144
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,990
Yes. So, please contact all his supporters.

145
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,090
Hello, this is Niikura.

146
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,190
You say that someone is after Mr. Ishimoto's life

147
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,690
and blackmailed him?

148
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,590
Yes, and that's why I was hired.

149
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,690
In other words,

150
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,290
the bullet that was aimed at Mr. Ishimoto went off its mark

151
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,390
and hit Mr. Takada instead.

152
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,490
Yes, that's right.

153
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,990
Since there were a lot of people here,

154
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,590
there may be some witnesses.

155
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,590
Officer Takagi! -Yes!

156
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,390
Where are the people who were here?

157
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,590
Well, they are all gathered in the room next door.

158
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:47,290
Conan, I don't want you go here and there on your own!

159
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:50,190
I got nervous, so I went to the restroom.

160
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,990
Oh, Pops!

161
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,190
Don't you dare say anything if it's about the murder!

162
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,490
But I saw a suspicious looking man.

163
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:02,690
-What? -First, he was over there by the wall,

164
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,190
but when the pistol went off,

165
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,990
he was in the light fixture box.

166
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,690
Is that so...

167
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,290
If from there,

168
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,090
it's possible to shoot despite all the people in the room

169
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,790
What kind of man was he?

170
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,390
This man.

171
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,590
He sure does look like a criminal.

172
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,790
What're you doing, Mr. Mouri?

173
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,790
Let's go.

174
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,090
Inspector!

175
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,790
There's a picture of a man who may be the culprit.

176
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,490
What? Are you serious?

177
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:33,390
Yes! I'm sure that it's him.

178
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:44,390
Conan, don't touch it.

179
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:47,090
Officer Takagi, what is this?

180
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:50,690
It's the debris of the compact microphone

181
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,190
that Mr. Takada was wearing on his chest.

182
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,590
The bullet hit him there?

183
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,790
Well, I guess so.

184
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,090
That's enough for now, isn't it, Conan?

185
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,590
I'm sorry, Officer Takagi.

186
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,090
I just happened to take my eyes off of him for a minute.

187
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,590
Conan, let's go wait in the lobby.

188
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,790
Conan, just where do you think you're going?

189
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,990
I've got to go to the restroom again. I may leak!

190
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,990
What restroom?

191
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,390
-That was fun, right? -Right!

192
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,490
She looks quite desperate.

193
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,690
Who is that long haired guy?

194
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,990
He's gone.

195
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:13,190
The president's life was in danger

196
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,490
and yet she is meeting with a man in secret.

197
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,790
There must be something behind all this.

198
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,880
Mr. Mouri, I've already been questioned,

199
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,080
so I guess I'll be going.

200
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,780
Mr. Ishimoto.

201
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,880
Maybe your wound isn't serious,

202
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,480
but somebody is after your life.

203
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,580
We'd like you to go to the police hospital just to be safe.

204
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,080
-Not to the police. -Huh?

205
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,480
There is an hospital that he always goes to.

206
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,580
Besides, whether one wants to be protected by the police or not,

207
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,380
it should be the choice of the individual.

208
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,880
Well, that's true.

209
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,280
But then, who is going to protect Mr. Ishimoto?

210
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,480
You, Mr. Mouri.

211
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,280
We're counting on you.

212
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,780
I see, all right!

213
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,080
I'll stay over here with you from tonight.

214
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,580
All right, let's go to the hospital, president.

215
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,680
Oh, Mr. Mouri.

216
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,980
-Yes. -About the man in the picture...

217
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,180
How was it?

218
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,680
I checked the list of participants,

219
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,280
but he wasn't on the list.

220
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,380
But we've laid a strict police ambush around the area.

221
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,980
Maybe we'll come up with something.

222
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,380
We are also checking if he has any previous record.

223
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,980
Mr. Mouri, what are you doing?

224
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,180
Please don't leave me alone!

225
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,780
Yes, yes, I'll be right with you.

226
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,980
Do you know which police hospital to take him to?

227
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,780
He says he doesn't like the police.

228
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,280
I'm going to sleep over there with Yukiko from tonight onwards

229
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,680
and be his bodyguard.

230
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,580
Hey!

231
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,180
I won't be held responsible for whatever may happen.

232
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,780
Please come this way.

233
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,480
What a fine car you have.

234
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,580
Yukiko, please come here.

235
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,580
Wouldn't it be safer to sit surrounding the the president?

236
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,580
That's true.

237
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,480
Come, you be nice and come home with me, okay?

238
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,680
Okay.

239
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,980
The subway station is that way.

240
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,780
Conan!

241
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,980
With that many people present at this hall,

242
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,680
it would be extremely difficult to shoot Mr. Ishimoto.

243
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,380
It would be impossible without the help of a professional marksman.

244
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,180
What's this?

245
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,880
There is a scratch and the remains of glue on the spotlight.

246
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,580
Why would something like this be here?

247
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,880
Wait a second.

248
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,280
The debris of a microphone...

249
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,280
The control room for the lights is...

250
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,680
This is something!

251
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,280
It's more like a hotel suite than a hospital.

252
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,580
The room that you'll be sleeping in is the room we just passed by.

253
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,280
In other words, there is only one entrance and exit.

254
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,380
If anyone were to sneak into this room,

255
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,280
they would have to go through your room first.

256
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,780
I see.

257
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,080
You're as careful as I thought you'd be.

258
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,880
You've got his safety well planned out.

259
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,780
Most naturally.

260
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,680
This company is run by the president himself,

261
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,080
so if anything ever happens to him, it'll close down.

262
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,380
By the way, where are you going to be staying over, Yukiko?

263
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,580
There's only one bed here.

264
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,480
I'm going home

265
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,480
because you're going to guard him, aren't you, Mr. Mouri?

266
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,680
Is that so?

267
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,080
How about it, Mr. Mouri?

268
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,580
Nice room, isn't it?

269
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,680
I'm counting on you!

270
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,880
Yes, I'll do my best.

271
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,280
President, don't you have to be treated for your wound?

272
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,980
That measly bullet.

273
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,880
This is only a scratch!

274
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,480
Ms. Tanaka, I'll leave Mr. Takada in your hands.

275
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,580
Yes, I'll make sure everything is taken care of.

276
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,180
Mr. Takada?

277
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,880
The funeral fees and compensation.

278
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,780
After all, Mr. Takada got shot in place of the president.

279
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,580
I was going to pay a visit to his house now.

280
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,380
Are you leaving already?

281
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,480
My appointment with Mr. Niikura is a bit later,

282
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,480
so I'll keep you company for a while.

283
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,480
Really?

284
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,680
All right!

285
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,780
Would you like something to drink?

286
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,880
Some beer, please.

287
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,280
I mean a cola.

288
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,780
Oh, right.

289
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,080
May I ask you a question?

290
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,880
Yes, what is it?

291
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,680
You mentioned that you chose me using the computer,

292
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,480
but there are a million of other private detectives, aren't there?

293
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,880
So why did you choose me?

294
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,580
If I were to choose by the amount of experience

295
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,580
and the capabilities of the detective,

296
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,680
there were many.

297
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,480
But when it comes to attractiveness of personality...

298
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,680
The result is obvious.

299
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,780
Who else could I have chosen but you, Mr. Mouri?

300
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,980
Well, your decision is correct, Yukiko!

301
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,280
I'm glad I lived this long.

302
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,980
Well, this cola sure is delicious!

303
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,380
Another cup, please.

304
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,880
Yes, that's right.

305
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,380
Please wait a minute.

306
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,980
It's for you, Mr. Mouri.

307
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,280
For me?

308
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,580
Thank you.

309
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,780
Hello, I'm the renown detective, Kogoro Mouri.

310
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,780
What a guy.

311
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,980
Calling yourself the renown detective.

312
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,780
Inspector Megure!

313
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,680
About that suspicious man who disappeared from the hall.

314
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,380
He had a record.

315
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,780
Really?

316
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,480
Yes, he's a real criminal.

317
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,080
"Shiro Hiraoka (35)" -Shiro Hiraoka, age 35.

318
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,580
He grabs business secrets of companies

319
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,280
and blackmails them for money.

320
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,880
He is notorious in the underworld for sucking his victims to the bone

321
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,680
and goes by the name, Hiraoka the Piranha.

322
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,980
Which means if Hiraoka is after him...

323
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,880
Mr. Ishimoto is probably being blackmailed

324
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,680
by Hiraoka for some reason.

325
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,680
Judging from Mr. Ishimoto's character,

326
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,780
he probably refused,

327
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:57,780
so Hiraoka was enraged and decided to kill him.

328
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,780
"Mouri Detective Agency"

329
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,780
This time you infuriated a professional killer like me.

330
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,780
You were very unlucky.

331
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,980
But there is just one way you can save yourself.

332
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,980
You will have to kill me.

333
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,680
Oh, I was wondering where you were.

334
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,780
And I find you watching TV.

335
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,780
It's time to go to bed.

336
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,480
Are you listening to me, Conan?

337
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,580
-I'm turning the TV off. -Wait!

338
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,080
I get it! That's how it was done!

339
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,880
What are you talking about?

340
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,580
We've been completely deceived by the culprit.

341
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,980
What a well devised murder.

342
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,980
But I don't have enough proof to prove how it was done yet.

343
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,380
Mr. Mouri, the phone is ringing!

344
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,780
Oh, no! I've fallen asleep.

345
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,080
I'm very sorry.

346
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,180
Yes, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

347
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,480
This is Mr. Mouri.

348
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,380
We've got trouble, Mr. Mouri!

349
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,980
Inspector? What's up?

350
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,080
Hiraoka Shiro's dead body was found!

351
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,080
What? Where?

352
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,480
It seems that he slipped and fell

353
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,980
at the dilapidated building where he was hiding.

354
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,680
He seems to have hit his head then, and died.

355
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,780
Is it an accident or...

356
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,280
We don't know yet.

357
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,780
We're going to go to the site now.

358
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,780
I'll contact you as soon as I get the details.

359
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,780
This area has been completely surrounded by the police.

360
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,080
"Mouri Detective Agency"

361
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,680
Good morning.

362
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,580
What? Is that true?

363
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,980
So, until you can be sure that Mr. Ishimoto is safe,

364
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,380
you can't come home?

365
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,580
Okay, I understand.

366
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,880
Is it from Pops?

367
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,380
Yes. He says that the Mr. Hiraoka that was in the picture,

368
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:49,380
and thought to be the one who shot Mr. Ishimoto was found dead.

369
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,980
What? Wasn't he murdered?

370
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,880
I guess it was an accident because he fell from the stairs.

371
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,680
It seems he slipped and fell from the stairs at the dilapidated building

372
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,180
that he was using as a hide-out and hit is head hard.

373
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,080
No, that was no accident.

374
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,780
If my assumption is correct, it's homicide!

375
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:13,780
The real culprit killed Hiraoka who knew the secret, to shut him up.

376
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,980
This case which started with

377
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,180
what looked to be that Mr. Ishimoto was blackmailed,

378
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,480
look like a simple case at first glance,

379
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,180
but a terrible truth is behind it.

380
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,880
I'll find the one string of truth

381
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,380
from among the complicatedly tangled strings.

382
