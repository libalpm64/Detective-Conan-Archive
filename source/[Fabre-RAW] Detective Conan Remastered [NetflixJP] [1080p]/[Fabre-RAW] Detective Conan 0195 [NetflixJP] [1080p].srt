1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,740
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,340
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,240
Deductions take all shapes and styles in each and every case to be solved.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,140
A ghostly, a pocket bell, stamps and a music box.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,040
Seemingly separate mysteries come to a singular end.

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,740
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,290
A young woman named Haruna Yuki

10
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,990
asks us to locate her pocket bell friend

11
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,790
who she hasn't been able to contact

12
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,090
because she wants to return his music box

13
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,390
but when we arrive at her friend Shugo Ogata's home,

14
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,990
we learn that he is dead.

15
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,490
Later that night,

16
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,390
Ran sees the suspicious shadow of an old man

17
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,390
walk down the corridor

18
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,590
and Shogo's grandson Minoru, has been attacked by someone.

19
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,190
And then, Haruna gets a mysterious message

20
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,390
on her pocket bell.

21
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,590
"I was waiting for you, Haruna"

22
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:36,590
"The Entrusted Music Box (Part 2)"

23
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,590
You didn't find any evidence of a break-in?

24
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,790
That's right.

25
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,890
The rain has made the ground pretty soft

26
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,790
but there're no footprints out there.

27
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,490
And even someone got in before the rain,

28
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,990
there should be footprints leaving the place.

29
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,390
But we didn't find anyone suspicious inside.

30
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,590
The only thing we were concerned about

31
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,790
was the unlocked back door, right?

32
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,790
-Yes. -The back door?

33
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,090
Oh, the lock on that door is broken,

34
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,890
it opens even when the wind blows.

35
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,190
That does bother me.

36
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,390
Then why don't you take a look yourself?

37
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,790
Even if someone did get in through that door,

38
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,790
don't you think there should be some footprints on the ground?

39
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,990
It's so muddy.

40
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,390
That's true. There're no footprints.

41
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,490
If there were, then maybe we could believe that story Ran told us

42
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,690
about seeing the shadow of an old man.

43
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,690
I told you, it wasn't my imagination.

44
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,290
Oh, no.

45
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,690
Would you mind moving your patrol car a bit?

46
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,690
Yes, right away. I'm terribly sorry.

47
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,590
First, let's go over all the details one more time,

48
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,590
then we'll check out the house.

49
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,990
-All right. -Young lady,

50
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,490
where did you see the suspicious shadow?

51
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,590
Uh, right here.

52
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,090
In this corridor. The old man with the cane was here

53
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,690
then he disappeared back there.

54
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,890
Then he must have hidden in that room at the far end.

55
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:12,290
No, I was in that room and I would have noticed.

56
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,890
But I saw it.

57
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,890
I saw his shadow through the screen door in this room.

58
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,190
And I saw it too.

59
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,190
Hey, whose room is this?

60
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,990
Oh, that room's my wife and mine.

61
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,090
When the girls saw the shadow,

62
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,990
were you and your wife in this room?

63
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,490
No. My wife and I were in the kitchen with our son Shiro.

64
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,790
-Eh? -Did you find the intruder?

65
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,590
No, I mean, 'ouch'.

66
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,590
I stepped on this hair pin that was on the floor.

67
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,790
Did you say hair pin?

68
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,890
Brat!

69
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,490
How many times have I told you not to get in my way?

70
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,490
Let me continue.

71
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:03,790
Was your son that got hurt also with you in the kitchen?

72
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:07,690
No, we all thought he was taking a bath though.

73
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,490
And could you tell me what you three were doing in the kitchen?

74
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,190
Shiro was giving us a scolding,

75
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,490
he said we were being very rude to Haruna,

76
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,190
bombarding her with so many questions

77
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,890
after she was kind enough to come all the way to visit us.

78
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,890
What kind of questions?

79
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,490
Well, the truth is,

80
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,590
Shugo, the head of this household and I

81
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,890
were bell friends

82
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,390
and they wanted to know what we talked about and such.

83
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,390
That's right.

84
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,790
The three of them, included Minoru,

85
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,790
were practically interrogating her like some kind of criminal.

86
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:39,390
Oh, but it didn't bother me at all.

87
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,890
I talked about how Shogo's interest in stamps

88
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,090
got me to collect them too

89
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,390
and I got to reminisce about a lot of good things.

90
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,690
I even asked if I could come back,

91
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,790
so I wasn't bothered in the least.

92
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,190
Speaking of stamps, Minoru did mention something

93
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,490
about hand carved stamps worth 200 million.

94
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,790
Where is he now?

95
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,290
Perhaps those stamps

96
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:05,590
have something to do with what happened tonight.

97
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:09,690
I think Minoru's in his room next door.

98
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,990
They disappeared?

99
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,190
Yes, that's right.

100
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,890
Grandfather had a great collection

101
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,490
but those hand carved stamps were by far the most impressive.

102
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,590
We counted on the money it'd bring when we sold it

103
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,590
so we started buy all sorts of things.

104
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,690
You said we?

105
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,290
Yes, mom and dad agreed on it.

106
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,690
Hey, listen.

107
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,490
-What is it? -Is your room next door?

108
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,090
Yes, it is, why?

109
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,790
Okay then.

110
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,790
And whose room is on the other side?

111
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,090
That's grandpa and grandma's room.

112
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,290
Then maybe...

113
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,690
Hey, kid?

114
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,390
I knew it.

115
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,290
This is the room Minoru got attacked in.

116
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,590
Which means...

117
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,690
the room's layout is like this.

118
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,990
I think I know how it worked now, I've figured out the trick.

119
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,590
Now to figure out whose shadow Ran saw

120
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:11,090
and why the music box Shugo gave Haruna is off tune.

121
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,590
I wrote down the notes to the song

122
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,690
listening to another music box

123
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,090
but I don't really know what is what.

124
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:23,090
That's the music for that song, Haru yo Koi.

125
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,790
-How did you get it? -I...

126
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,890
it just happened to be part of my homework for music class.

127
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,090
Let me see that. I'll rewrite it so it's right.

128
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,490
Hey, give it back.

129
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,290
Let's see.

130
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,090
Geez...

131
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,190
Ran.

132
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,290
Huh? What is it?

133
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,890
Oh, nothing, nothing at all.

134
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:59,190
Here, I think that's right.

135
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,590
She's good as I suspected.

136
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,990
Hey, Ran.

137
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,390
What are these three # (sharps) for?

138
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,190
Oh, that stands for A major.

139
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,190
A major? That's it!

140
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,490
If anything comes up, feel free to call us anytime.

141
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,890
Thanks.

142
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,090
We still don't know whether it was a thief or a ghost.

143
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,190
-Yes. -Excuse me.

144
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,390
Has anyone seen Conan?

145
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,890
This is so simple.

146
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,690
I've got it now. I've figured everything out.

147
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,690
I know the identity of the ghost in the house

148
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,990
and who sent the mysterious message on the pocket bell

149
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,690
and I know what that off tune music box means

150
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,590
and Shugo,

151
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:56,990
I know where you hid those precious stamps of yours.

152
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,490
Now all I've got to do is,

153
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,590
put Uncle Kogoro to sleep as usual and...

154
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,290
Ouch...

155
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,490
Listen, you.

156
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,890
How many times have I told you not to go wandering off?

157
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,090
Ouch.

158
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,790
Come on, we're going home.

159
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,690
Going home?

160
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,990
But I just found something interesting.

161
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,090
There, look at that.

162
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,990
See what? What're you talking about?

163
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,990
Move a little to the right.

164
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,690
To the right?

165
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,790
Dad?

166
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,490
I see, so that's how it worked.

167
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,890
Ran, tell everyone to come here.

168
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,990
Yes.

169
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,190
Wait, before you do, get me some black paper,

170
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,490
a pair of scissors and some cellophane tape.

171
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,690
Where is he?

172
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,790
You found the thief, didn't you?

173
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:03,190
Thief? There wasn't a thief in the first place.

174
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,390
You're not going to tell us it was father's ghost, are you?

175
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,390
Of course not, that also never existed.

176
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,790
All the strange things that happened tonight

177
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,190
were orchestrated by one of you.

178
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:19,790
What?

179
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,990
But then ghostly things have happened before tonight too.

180
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,190
Before tonight?

181
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,690
Yes, I'm talking about the time

182
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:30,490
Haruna got the music box from Shugo.

183
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,590
Yes, she told us that story many times.

184
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,490
It's about the time gramps gave her the music box

185
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,190
without telling us about it, 2 Christmases ago.

186
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:43,990
Uh, no. He gave me the music box last Christmas.

187
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:48,390
That's impossible. Dad died last year on December 6th.

188
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,990
That can't be?

189
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:55,090
And on top of that, father had been hospitalized since that spring

190
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,090
and was in no condition to move around.

191
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:02,490
-Hey, what's going on around here? -It's very simple.

192
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,690
Someone pretended to be Shugo

193
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,690
and left the package containing the music box at Haruna's feet

194
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,890
while she waited for him in front of the Hachiko statue, that's all.

195
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,090
Isn't that right?

196
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,790
Shiro?

197
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,890
Shiro did it?

198
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,690
Is that true?

199
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,490
Hey, Shiro.

200
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,290
He asked me to.

201
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,190
Grandpa asked me to.

202
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,990
He said, 'even after I'm hospitalized,

203
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,590
I want you look after this girl'.

204
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,390
She reminds me of your grandmother and she's very lonely.

205
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,690
Do you mean, you've been sending me messages since last spring?

206
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,190
Yes. I've been communicating with you

207
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,390
on my grandfather's behalf.

208
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,190
Actually, I intended to tell you the truth

209
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:47,190
when I saw you that Christmas, but...

210
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,590
When I saw you standing there, with that red muffler around your neck,

211
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,990
you looked so excited and happy,

212
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,490
that's why I just couldn't bring myself to do it.

213
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,490
But, how did you know it was me?

214
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:01,290
I knew from the start that it was you

215
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,190
who gave Haruna the music box.

216
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,690
I knew it the moment you came to meet us at the front door.

217
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,790
I don't believe you.

218
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:13,490
When you saw Haruna, you put your hand on her shoulder

219
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,690
and said this, didn't you?

220
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,690
The infamous "Haruna" has come to pay us a visit.

221
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,090
Let's have her relax in her room for a while.

222
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:24,390
At that point, we still hadn't introduced ourselves

223
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,290
and Ran, who's about the same age as Haruna, was also present.

224
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,390
But you knew exactly which one she was,

225
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:34,190
although no one had actually met her yet.

226
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,690
That's when it suddenly hit me.

227
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:41,090
Maybe it was you who gave her the music box.

228
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,990
If that's true, then was it you?

229
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,790
Did you drop that koto on me because you got mad that

230
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,190
I was giving her the third degree?

231
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,990
No, that wasn't me.

232
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,290
Ran, turn the lights off.

233
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,390
-Hurry. -Yes.

234
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,990
Conan?

235
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,080
Conan?

236
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,880
Hey? Conan, where are you?

237
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,080
Ran, I'm over here.

238
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,680
How'd you get over there?

239
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,480
I've always been here.

240
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,480
Liar. I just saw your shadow on the screen door.

241
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,180
Take a look at the glass out in the hall.

242
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,580
The glass out in the hall?

243
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,780
What am I supposed to see?

244
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,480
Why, this it...

245
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,880
There's a piece of black paper taped to the glass.

246
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
It's shaped like Conan.

247
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,080
I put it there a little while ago because Uncle Kogoro told me to.

248
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,280
Then are you saying that the old man Ran saw was...

249
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,080
That's right, Ran saw a shadow picture.

250
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,180
An old man's figure, cut out of black paper

251
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,880
is taped to the glass in the hall.

252
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,280
If a car approached the back street,

253
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,880
the lights from the headlight will shine through

254
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,480
the half open back door

255
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,280
and the shadow of the paper cut old man

256
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,780
will be reflected onto the screen door, that's the trick.

257
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,880
Now that you mention it, when I saw the old man's shadow,

258
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,680
I did hear a swooshing sound.

259
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,180
That was probably the sound of a car passing on the rain wet road.

260
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,280
I see.

261
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,080
So by using that trick, you don't have to actually be present

262
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,480
when the old man makes his appearance.

263
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,280
Shiro, even you could've.

264
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,580
Like I told you before, I was right here

265
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,480
-same as when you got attacked. -You could have done that too,

266
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,680
while being in this room.

267
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,480
It's a simple booby trap, all you need is some fishing line

268
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,580
and some hair pins to make it.

269
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,680
A booby trap?

270
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,780
The person who caused this commotion,

271
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,280
hung the koto from the ceiling in your grandfathers' room

272
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,780
and then let it fall,

273
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,980
it was just coincidence that you got hit by it.

274
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,380
Minoru, you snuck in there to check out the koto.

275
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,380
That's right, that's how you got hit.

276
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,780
You don't know what you're talking about,

277
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,780
why would I want to search the koto for?

278
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,780
Because during dinner,

279
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,980
Haruna mentioned that the music box played Haru yo Koi

280
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,280
and since it was your grandmother's favorite song

281
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,080
and she always played it on the koto,

282
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:09,880
you thought the stamps just might be hidden inside the koto.

283
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,880
But even if the koto dropped down from the ceiling,

284
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,680
I don't see how it could have knocked him unconscious,

285
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,880
there wasn't enough momentum.

286
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,380
Besides, if he was going to look inside the koto,

287
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,580
wouldn't he have turned the lights on?

288
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:28,680
When we got there, the room was dark, wasn't it?

289
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:33,580
Minoru didn't not turn the lights on, he couldn't.

290
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,080
The device the culprit rigged raised the light up,

291
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,180
close to the ceiling and in the dark,

292
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:43,980
Minoru didn't know where the light cord was,

293
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,480
left with no other choice,

294
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,180
Minoru got down on the floor

295
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,580
and felt around the area the koto usually is,

296
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,980
when he found it, he intended to take it to his room.

297
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,680
Then he heard the sound of the string

298
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,180
rubbing against the fishing line and he looked up,

299
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,080
and of all the bad luck, that's when it fell on his head.

300
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,680
Minoru.

301
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,480
Okay, so you're right, you've got me.

302
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,480
But how was it rigged to drop the koto, anyway?

303
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,780
It's very simple.

304
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,680
First, you get one very long fishing line

305
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,580
wrap the light cord around the middle of the fishing line,

306
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,780
then pass both ends of the line under the string,

307
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,780
the koto is then probably temporarily placed on the chest.

308
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,780
Next, both ends of the line is passed through the transom

309
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,180
and went through Shiro's room, then Minoru's

310
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,680
and then Mr. and Mrs. Ogata's

311
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,680
until finally reaching the room Ran and Haruna were staying in.

312
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,480
Then, so the line wouldn't sag, both ends were tied

313
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,080
then set in place between the doors with a hair pin.

314
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,080
Next, take the koto off the chest and let it hang,

315
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,380
then your booby trap is complete.

316
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,880
After that, all you had to do was open the door...

317
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,080
The hair pin would be released

318
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,880
and that would lead to the koto falling.

319
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,380
Now wait just one minute, you're not saying that...

320
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,580
That's right.

321
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,680
The person responsible for tonight's ghostly apparition

322
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,780
is the person who opened that door.

323
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,680
Kazuko.

324
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,680
It was you, wasn't it?

325
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,180
Mother?

326
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,580
But why?

327
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,580
It's probably because

328
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:20,080
she didn't want Haruna to go looking for those stamps.

329
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,280
I'm pretty sure she rigged the booby trap while we were eating,

330
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,280
when she left to go prepare our bedding.

331
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,180
Then when she heard Ran and Haruna scream,

332
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,780
she came running and opened the door nonchalantly,

333
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,080
causing the koto to fall.

334
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,680
And then, while everyone was rushing to Shugo's room,

335
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,980
she removed the cut out from the window

336
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,980
and sent a message to Haruna's pocket bell from her cellular,

337
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,080
trying to scare her.

338
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,080
"I was waiting for you, Haruna"

339
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,980
She was trying to frighten Haruna away from this house.

340
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:00,580
But what did she do with all that fishing line after that?

341
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,880
Mom was right behind us when we got to grandfather's room.

342
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,380
She didn't have time to take the paper off the window

343
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,380
and remove all the fishing line while using the telephone.

344
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,780
She had a very handy helper.

345
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,380
It's right behind Ran.

346
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,680
A fan?

347
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,280
I'm pretty sure she cut the tied end of the line

348
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:27,380
and pulled one end into this room then used tape to tape it.

349
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,980
To the back of this fans blade.

350
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,980
I see.

351
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,580
All she had to do was turn the switch on

352
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,080
and it would automatically reel the line in.

353
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,980
I still can't believe it though.

354
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,380
How could you think of such a thing

355
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,180
in the short time you had during dinner?

356
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,580
It's not impossible.

357
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,680
After all, this trick with the fishing line,

358
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,380
is something I picked up from the pranks the boys used to pull

359
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,080
when they were children.

360
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,280
What about the cut out of the old man?

361
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,080
Oh, that, a guest who stayed with us once

362
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,780
thought some leaves stuck to the window was someone's shadow,

363
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,380
I remembered that.

364
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,480
Haruna scared me.

365
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,180
She mentioned she collected stamps

366
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,780
and she said she wanted to visit us again.

367
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:18,480
Were you the one who sent me the messages before saying, 'Thief'?

368
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,480
Yes, that was me. I'm sorry.

369
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,680
Mother, that was terrible.

370
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,980
How could you break grandmothers koto over a thing like that?

371
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,480
Oh, that koto isn't worth anything.

372
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,180
-How can you say that? -The truth is,

373
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:37,280
I pawned the real koto and got a cheap replacement.

374
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,280
My new system kitchen, your new car,

375
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,280
Minoru's computer,

376
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,780
we were so far in debt.

377
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,180
Then I guess we'll just have to sell

378
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,780
the music box grandfather gave me.

379
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,780
Oh, but I had it looked at and I was told

380
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,780
it was just an ordinary souvenir item.

381
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,880
That's strange.

382
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,280
Grandfather told me that

383
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,880
in appreciation of my posing to be him,

384
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,380
he was giving me his music box,

385
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,880
those who knew what they were looking at

386
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,780
would realize it was worth 200 million.

387
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:11,680
200 million? That music box?

388
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,680
Dad bought that as a souvenir when he went to a hot spring.

389
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,480
Grandpa pulled a fast one on you.

390
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,380
The music box itself isn't worth anything,

391
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,980
it's the missing notes.

392
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,580
In Japan, we use the Do Re Mi musical scale

393
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,380
and also, the native notation, I Ro Ha.

394
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,980
The missing notes are 'La', 'Do' and 'La'

395
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,780
and if we use the I Ro Ha scale,

396
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,080
it would be 'I', 'Ha' and 'I'.

397
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,480
Ihai? (Mortuary tablet)

398
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,780
You don't mean?

399
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,980
-I don't believe it... -It can't be...

400
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,780
-I've got it. -This is it.

401
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,480
Oh, thank goodness.

402
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,680
Hip, hip, hurray...

403
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,980
What's going on?

404
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,780
Oh, thank you so much.

405
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,580
Now I can buy that koto back.

406
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,180
We owe it all to you.

407
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,380
Who are you anyway?

408
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:25,980
Well, the truth is, my name is Kogoro Mouri.

409
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,080
The... Kogoro Mouri?

410
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,280
The famous private detective?

411
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,780
That's me.

412
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,880
Why didn't you tell us that earlier?

413
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,180
If we'd known that, we'd have asked you to look for stamps.

414
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,380
And Minoru wouldn't have gotten hurt.

415
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,280
Yes, well...

416
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,480
What a selfish bunch.

417
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,080
Thank you for everything.

418
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,780
No, we should thank you.

419
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,380
Are you sure you have no regrets, though?

420
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:23,180
Shugo might have intended to give you alone, those stamps.

421
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,380
I don't mind.

422
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,280
Because I got to keep something worth even more.

423
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,780
It's grandfathers pocket bell.

424
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,780
Haruna gave it to me.

425
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,780
And she asked if I'd continue to give her moral support.

426
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,980
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

427
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,180
You know, I think springs here.

428
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,380
Spring? It's almost summer.

429
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,480
Never mind, for Shiro, it's spring.

430
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,480
What's that supposed to mean?

431
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:56,080
Spring, come to me. Hurry to me.

432
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,580
It never comes to me.

433
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,420
Next Conan's Hint:

434
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,060
"Car"

435
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,540
In the next episode, Ran displays her finesse.

436
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,220
There's always only one truth!
