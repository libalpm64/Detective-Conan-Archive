1
00:00:22,862 --> 00:00:24,462
Today's stage is also Okinawa!

2
00:00:24,462 --> 00:00:26,062
An alibi trick that goes through the sky.

3
00:00:26,062 --> 00:00:27,762
See through the case with deduction from a different angle.

4
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:29,262
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:31,062
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,062 --> 00:00:32,962
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,925
A TV program is to be aired with

8
00:01:58,925 --> 00:02:01,625
professional baseball player, Toshizou Nose,

9
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:05,325
sports reporter, Masaharu Motoyama and Pops in a talk show,

10
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:08,025
so we all head off to Okinawa.

11
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,825
We join Mr. Motoyama at Naha Airport,

12
00:02:11,825 --> 00:02:14,725
and go to see Mr. Nose,

13
00:02:14,725 --> 00:02:16,125
however, on the way...

14
00:02:18,225 --> 00:02:19,625
That is...

15
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,425
The uniform of the Jaguars.

16
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:28,125
-Hey! Isn't that Mr. Nose? -No way.

17
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:31,725
Hurry and contact the police and get an ambulance!

18
00:02:31,725 --> 00:02:33,225
The police?

19
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:41,725
At any rate, please arrest the murderer as soon as possible.

20
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:44,825
The devil who got in the way of my best friend

21
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:47,225
making his Japan record of saves.

22
00:02:47,225 --> 00:02:48,925
No, not right.

23
00:02:48,925 --> 00:02:50,625
He's the killer.

24
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:02,625
What the...

25
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:17,125
"The Silent Route (Part 2)"

26
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,625
Conan...

27
00:03:22,425 --> 00:03:23,725
What's the matter?

28
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:24,725
Are you all right?

29
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:26,225
What a frightening look you have on your face.

30
00:03:26,225 --> 00:03:28,125
It's nothing.

31
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,925
Really?

32
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:32,625
Yeah. I was surprised too.

33
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,925
-Well, I'll tell you the details again later. -What was that just now?

34
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:39,525
Oh, right! Mr. Teranishi, please lend me the car key.

35
00:03:39,525 --> 00:03:41,425
I forgot something in the car.

36
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,225
Excuse me!

37
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:01,725
May I ask you something?

38
00:04:04,425 --> 00:04:06,225
What is it, sonny?

39
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:10,025
The key of the hotel of Miyazaki that you just had

40
00:04:10,025 --> 00:04:11,825
isn't disposable, is it?

41
00:04:14,425 --> 00:04:16,225
Why didn't you return it to the front desk

42
00:04:16,225 --> 00:04:18,425
when you checked out?

43
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:21,625
I haven't checked out yet.

44
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:25,325
I've got another interview in Miyazaki day after tomorrow.

45
00:04:25,325 --> 00:04:30,125
But, you were planning to have an interview tomorrow too, right?

46
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,925
Going back to the hotel in Miyazaki, then coming back again,

47
00:04:32,925 --> 00:04:36,025
isn't that a waste of plane fare?

48
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,325
You couldn't have known before hand

49
00:04:37,325 --> 00:04:40,925
that the interview tomorrow was going to be cancelled, did you?

50
00:04:40,925 --> 00:04:43,425
This brat.

51
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:47,125
Did you find what you forgot?

52
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,925
No.

53
00:04:48,925 --> 00:04:51,425
It must've been my mistake.

54
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:52,425
Thanks for this.

55
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,825
By the way, why are you all here?

56
00:04:59,825 --> 00:05:03,125
Well, they say they're doing another circumstantial investigation,

57
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,425
where Mr. Nose was found dead.

58
00:05:05,425 --> 00:05:07,925
Well... It's just to be sure.

59
00:05:10,425 --> 00:05:12,625
Excuse me.

60
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,325
Are you left handed?

61
00:05:14,325 --> 00:05:16,525
No.

62
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,125
But you caught the key with your left hand just a while ago.

63
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,725
It's a habit!

64
00:05:20,725 --> 00:05:22,425
I used to be an ace number 4 player of the baseball club

65
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:23,825
until high school.

66
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,725
And...

67
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:33,625
Why did you use such a back street to go to Mr. Nose's hotel?

68
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:37,525
The main roads around that area are crowded just about that time of day.

69
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:40,525
That's why although it's the long way around,

70
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:42,125
we can get to our destination faster using the back road.

71
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:45,525
Wait a second.

72
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:46,725
If I remember correctly...

73
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:51,025
I'm sure that...

74
00:05:54,025 --> 00:05:55,125
This is it!

75
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,025
I get it.

76
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:07,425
So, that's what it was.

77
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:12,125
It's not that he didn't check-out of the hotel.

78
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,425
He couldn't.

79
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:16,025
No doubt about it.

80
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:18,825
The killer is Mr. Motoyama.

81
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:21,525
He's the one who killed Mr. Nose.

82
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:25,725
He used the back road of the sky to his advantage.

83
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,025
Inspector!

84
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:36,725
I've finished asking around!

85
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:38,925
And, did you find any witnesses?

86
00:06:38,925 --> 00:06:39,925
Well...

87
00:06:39,925 --> 00:06:43,025
there was no one who passed by here

88
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:46,625
just about the time Mr. Nose was killed around 9:30 am.

89
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:51,325
No witness, weapon nor evidence?

90
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:53,925
Let's take it easy and take our time, Inspector!

91
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:55,425
There's still a lot of time

92
00:06:55,425 --> 00:06:57,825
before it's time for us to board our plane for Tokyo,

93
00:06:57,825 --> 00:06:59,625
If you think carefully,

94
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,625
you may come up with evidence

95
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:07,125
that the killer inadvertently forgot to get rid of!

96
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,225
You brat, cut out your irresponsible comments.

97
00:07:16,925 --> 00:07:18,425
Excuse me.

98
00:07:18,425 --> 00:07:19,925
I'm sorry...

99
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:22,825
but could I be excused to get something to eat?

100
00:07:22,825 --> 00:07:26,225
I haven't had a bite since I've come here.

101
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,325
True.

102
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:30,825
No problem.

103
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,125
I'll wait here.

104
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,425
So go ahead.

105
00:07:33,425 --> 00:07:35,925
Would you like to come along too?

106
00:07:35,925 --> 00:07:37,325
I guess so.

107
00:07:37,325 --> 00:07:40,725
Let's take my car and go all together then!

108
00:07:40,725 --> 00:07:42,525
Thank you.

109
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,325
This is a restaurant that I come to often,

110
00:07:50,325 --> 00:07:51,725
and it's quite delicious!

111
00:07:52,925 --> 00:07:56,725
Let's eat and return as soon as we can then!

112
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:02,525
It's from the producer of the TV station.

113
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:05,425
We'll wait for you inside the restaurant then.

114
00:08:05,425 --> 00:08:08,425
So when you're done could you lock the car and come.

115
00:08:10,225 --> 00:08:11,625
We'll go on ahead.

116
00:08:15,025 --> 00:08:16,025
Conan!

117
00:08:16,025 --> 00:08:18,225
-Okay. -Hello, Motoyama here.

118
00:08:18,225 --> 00:08:19,625
What's up?

119
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:24,625
I got a call on my cell from you that rang once and hung up,

120
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,125
that's why I'm returning your call.

121
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,225
I thought that maybe something new came up

122
00:08:27,225 --> 00:08:29,625
regarding Nose's case.

123
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,725
Oh, sorry,

124
00:08:30,725 --> 00:08:33,525
I think I may have mistakenly pushed the button.

125
00:08:36,825 --> 00:08:39,525
I'll contact you if anything comes up.

126
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:40,625
Goodbye.

127
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,225
What are you doing, Conan?

128
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:50,025
Oh, well.

129
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:54,625
I was just thinking what a great detective Mr. Motoyama is.

130
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:55,925
Idiot!

131
00:08:55,925 --> 00:08:58,025
You're talking about him sensing that Mr. Nose was killed

132
00:08:58,025 --> 00:09:01,025
just as soon as he saw him lying on the ground, right?

133
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:04,525
Didn't I tell you that Mr. Motoyama sensed it

134
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:08,925
because he knew that somebody had been threatening Mr. Nose!

135
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:10,425
No!

136
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:16,225
Remember what Mr. Motoyama told me at the airport?

137
00:09:16,225 --> 00:09:17,525
What?

138
00:09:17,525 --> 00:09:19,625
He said, let's go, sonny!

139
00:09:26,925 --> 00:09:28,525
Hey! Let's go, sonny!

140
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,925
So why does that make him a great detective?

141
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:40,725
Because I was away from you and Ran back then

142
00:09:40,725 --> 00:09:43,325
and I was talking to the security guard.

143
00:09:44,425 --> 00:09:48,325
But you still could tell that I was supposed to be with you.

144
00:09:48,325 --> 00:09:50,925
That's what you call super deduction, right?

145
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:54,125
Come to think of it...

146
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,125
That's strange because this is the first time we ever met.

147
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,625
Well, I guess we can talk it over having a meal.

148
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,025
The place is packed!

149
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:06,125
I wonder if there are any empty seats?

150
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,325
Everyone!

151
00:10:07,325 --> 00:10:09,525
This way! Over here!

152
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:13,125
He's found us seats but it's hard to get straight over there.

153
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,625
Okay, then...

154
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,825
The back road!

155
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:22,925
There, I'm already here!

156
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:28,425
Taking the longer way, got me here faster!

157
00:10:41,703 --> 00:10:43,203
This is it.

158
00:10:43,203 --> 00:10:45,303
As long as I get rid of this...

159
00:10:48,303 --> 00:10:52,403
Nobody will ever be able to see through the crime that I...

160
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:54,203
I'm sorry,

161
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:58,703
but will you please get the timetable from my bag?

162
00:10:58,703 --> 00:11:00,903
I forgot what time our flight is.

163
00:11:05,603 --> 00:11:08,903
-Is this it? -Thank you.

164
00:11:14,603 --> 00:11:16,503
Oh, that's right!

165
00:11:16,503 --> 00:11:20,403
An acquaintance asked me to get him a souvenir from Okinawa.

166
00:11:20,403 --> 00:11:22,103
Will you tell everyone

167
00:11:22,103 --> 00:11:24,703
to go ahead and finish the meal without me,

168
00:11:24,703 --> 00:11:26,403
because I want to go get the souvenir first?

169
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:31,903
Well, after I'm done,

170
00:11:31,903 --> 00:11:35,003
I'll buy some bread or something and join you all.

171
00:11:35,003 --> 00:11:37,303
Oh, all right!

172
00:11:50,903 --> 00:11:54,503
"Naha Airport Parking Lot"

173
00:12:15,103 --> 00:12:17,503
My...

174
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,703
You seem to be enjoying yourself a lot.

175
00:12:20,703 --> 00:12:22,803
Your best friend passed away

176
00:12:22,803 --> 00:12:25,703
and you look to be quite over the grief already.

177
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,203
Well, I guess it's only natural.

178
00:12:28,203 --> 00:12:30,903
Because you're the one who killed him.

179
00:12:30,903 --> 00:12:33,703
What? Don't be ridiculous.

180
00:12:33,703 --> 00:12:37,303
You even said I have an alibi.

181
00:12:40,103 --> 00:12:41,903
Nose was killed

182
00:12:41,903 --> 00:12:44,603
if I remember correctly at about 9:30 this morning.

183
00:12:44,603 --> 00:12:47,503
I arrived on the 9:50 am,

184
00:12:47,503 --> 00:12:50,703
flight from Miyazaki to Okinawa, you know?

185
00:12:53,403 --> 00:12:57,203
Moreover, that is the only flight from Miyazaki,

186
00:12:57,203 --> 00:13:01,803
and I was on the program that was aired live in Miyazaki, wasn't I?

187
00:13:01,803 --> 00:13:06,203
So, how could I have killed Nose?

188
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:09,703
It's true that you couldn't come directly from Miyazaki but...

189
00:13:14,103 --> 00:13:17,003
But if you take the long way around via Tokyo.

190
00:13:17,003 --> 00:13:21,303
It's possible for you to set foot on Okinawa before 9:30 am!

191
00:13:22,403 --> 00:13:24,603
Yes, you avoided the crowded main road

192
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:29,403
and took the back road which got you faster to your destination.

193
00:13:29,403 --> 00:13:34,403
You took the 8:35 pm flight from Miyazaki to Tokyo

194
00:13:34,403 --> 00:13:39,703
and headed for Okinawa on the 6:55 am morning flight from Tokyo.

195
00:13:39,703 --> 00:13:43,303
This would allow you to arrive here at 9:20 am!

196
00:13:43,303 --> 00:13:46,803
Then you went with that rental car

197
00:13:46,803 --> 00:13:50,103
from the airport to Mr. Nose's jogging route,

198
00:13:50,103 --> 00:13:51,903
ambushed and killed him.

199
00:13:51,903 --> 00:13:54,903
You returned to the airport by 9:50 am

200
00:13:54,903 --> 00:13:58,003
and pretended that you just arrived in Okinawa,

201
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,003
then, came to see us!

202
00:14:01,003 --> 00:14:03,403
Wait!

203
00:14:03,403 --> 00:14:05,903
I came out of the Naha Airport arrival gate

204
00:14:05,903 --> 00:14:09,503
this morning at 09:50 am, right?

205
00:14:11,003 --> 00:14:14,003
Let's say I did come in on the 09:20 am flight

206
00:14:14,003 --> 00:14:16,303
and left the gate going outside once,

207
00:14:16,303 --> 00:14:21,203
how was I supposed to enter the arrival lobby again?

208
00:14:21,203 --> 00:14:23,703
-Well... -Well...

209
00:14:23,703 --> 00:14:25,603
That's true.

210
00:14:26,803 --> 00:14:28,803
-See. -Hey.

211
00:14:28,803 --> 00:14:31,303
Mr. Mouri.

212
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:34,403
We came here because you said you figured out who the killer was.

213
00:14:34,403 --> 00:14:35,603
Oh, well.

214
00:14:35,603 --> 00:14:38,803
-Talk about hopeless. -Right, that's right.

215
00:14:38,803 --> 00:14:44,503
Why were the people in the store a while ago giving us strange looks?

216
00:14:44,503 --> 00:14:46,003
Of course!

217
00:14:46,003 --> 00:14:48,203
We went into the store,

218
00:14:48,203 --> 00:14:50,703
sat down and left without ordering anything.

219
00:14:50,703 --> 00:14:52,703
I'll bet you're hungry.

220
00:14:52,703 --> 00:14:54,703
Would you like my juice?

221
00:14:54,703 --> 00:14:56,503
Oh, yes, please!

222
00:14:56,503 --> 00:15:00,103
You went into the store and left without ordering anything?

223
00:15:00,103 --> 00:15:01,903
Hey!

224
00:15:01,903 --> 00:15:05,503
Come to think of it, the embarkation and arrival floors of Naha Airport

225
00:15:05,503 --> 00:15:07,803
are connected on the inside?

226
00:15:07,803 --> 00:15:09,903
Yes, that's right.

227
00:15:09,903 --> 00:15:11,703
Which means...

228
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,503
you could've just bought any ticket

229
00:15:13,503 --> 00:15:15,103
and go inside from the embarkation gate

230
00:15:15,103 --> 00:15:18,803
and come out from the arrival gate without boarding the plane.

231
00:15:18,803 --> 00:15:21,203
That's right, exactly!

232
00:15:22,303 --> 00:15:24,503
Which means you still not being checked out

233
00:15:24,503 --> 00:15:28,303
from the hotel in Miyazaki suspicious too.

234
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:31,603
If you came from Miyazaki to Okinawa on this morning's flight,

235
00:15:31,603 --> 00:15:35,503
you would've checked out from the hotel in Miyazaki.

236
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:38,103
If you also have an interview scheduled in Okinawa tomorrow,

237
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,803
it's only natural for you to spend the night here.

238
00:15:40,803 --> 00:15:42,603
But you couldn't do so

239
00:15:42,603 --> 00:15:46,903
because you were already away from Miyazaki at that time.

240
00:15:46,903 --> 00:15:51,503
Isn't it because you're on a flight last night and already in Tokyo?

241
00:15:51,503 --> 00:15:53,103
Any evidence?

242
00:15:53,103 --> 00:15:56,103
Of course we've got evidence!

243
00:15:56,103 --> 00:15:58,003
Right, Mr. Mouri?

244
00:15:58,003 --> 00:16:00,703
What?

245
00:16:00,703 --> 00:16:02,003
Now, what was it?

246
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:05,303
Let's leave the rest up to the famous detective!

247
00:16:08,603 --> 00:16:11,003
Pops!

248
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,703
You want juice, don't you?

249
00:16:20,503 --> 00:16:21,803
Right!

250
00:16:21,803 --> 00:16:23,103
That's right!

251
00:16:23,103 --> 00:16:25,703
Please check the flight from Tokyo to Okinawa

252
00:16:25,703 --> 00:16:29,803
that Mr. Motoyama used to carry out his trick

253
00:16:29,803 --> 00:16:32,303
because we were on board that flight too.

254
00:16:33,603 --> 00:16:37,703
My daughter happened to spill tennis balls on board this flight.

255
00:16:37,703 --> 00:16:41,703
And the passenger in the next seat helped pick up the balls.

256
00:16:41,703 --> 00:16:44,703
He was among the passengers,

257
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:47,703
a suspicious man that caught the tennis ball

258
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:49,503
with his left hand.

259
00:16:49,503 --> 00:16:52,003
Was that Mr. Motoyama?

260
00:16:52,003 --> 00:16:55,203
But, isn't he right-handed?

261
00:16:55,203 --> 00:16:59,003
A habit since he caught so many balls with his left hand.

262
00:16:59,003 --> 00:17:04,103
Moreover, his job required him to protect is right hand.

263
00:17:04,103 --> 00:17:07,203
That's why he used his left hand

264
00:17:07,203 --> 00:17:08,603
without thinking.

265
00:17:10,403 --> 00:17:13,103
So, please give it to me.

266
00:17:13,103 --> 00:17:17,303
The stuff that you took out from Ran's bag and hid in your pocket.

267
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:19,303
Mr. Masaharu Motoyama,

268
00:17:19,303 --> 00:17:21,203
the baseball player who in the past,

269
00:17:21,203 --> 00:17:23,203
was awarded the King of rookie and save.

270
00:17:23,203 --> 00:17:25,903
Just what are you talking about?

271
00:17:25,903 --> 00:17:28,403
You're sweating! You must be hot?

272
00:17:28,403 --> 00:17:30,803
How about some juice?

273
00:17:48,503 --> 00:17:49,503
Yes.

274
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:52,803
Your fingerprints on the tennis ball that you picked up back then

275
00:17:52,803 --> 00:17:55,803
is evidence that you are the killer.

276
00:17:57,903 --> 00:17:58,903
That is what I'd like to say

277
00:17:58,903 --> 00:18:01,003
but that's not how it is.

278
00:18:02,403 --> 00:18:06,403
The surface of a hard tennis ball is fluffy making it difficult

279
00:18:06,403 --> 00:18:09,003
for fingerprints to remain.

280
00:18:09,003 --> 00:18:10,603
And, even if it were found on the ball,

281
00:18:10,603 --> 00:18:15,103
it would only serve as proof that you were on the same flight as we were.

282
00:18:15,103 --> 00:18:18,903
It won't serve as proof that you killed Mr. Nose.

283
00:18:18,903 --> 00:18:22,303
That's why we deliberately made you steal the can of tennis balls

284
00:18:22,303 --> 00:18:23,903
and made you swim.

285
00:18:27,003 --> 00:18:29,003
Because we figured you would undoubtedly lead us

286
00:18:29,003 --> 00:18:32,503
to the weapon you used for the murder

287
00:18:32,503 --> 00:18:33,903
and the place you hid the clothes splotched

288
00:18:33,903 --> 00:18:36,303
with blood when you killed the victim!

289
00:18:36,303 --> 00:18:38,803
This is unmistakably immovable evidence!

290
00:18:38,803 --> 00:18:41,203
But, how amazing that you saw through everything

291
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,303
just by watching him catch the can with his left hand!

292
00:18:43,303 --> 00:18:44,703
Well...

293
00:18:44,703 --> 00:18:47,103
I happened to remember that Mr. Motoyama,

294
00:18:47,103 --> 00:18:48,503
though we met for the first time,

295
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:51,703
called out to this boy knowing that

296
00:18:51,703 --> 00:18:53,203
he was with us and everything fell in place!

297
00:18:53,203 --> 00:18:55,803
I figured that maybe Mr. Motoyama saw us all together somewhere

298
00:18:55,803 --> 00:19:00,103
before seeing us at the airport.

299
00:19:01,603 --> 00:19:06,803
Well, even a snotty kid like him can be of use at times.

300
00:19:06,803 --> 00:19:10,103
I should've put him to sleep with the tranquilizer gun after all.

301
00:19:10,103 --> 00:19:12,103
Talk about ironic.

302
00:19:12,103 --> 00:19:14,903
To think that my habit ended my baseball career,

303
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:18,003
and again with this habit of mine, I dug my own grave.

304
00:19:18,003 --> 00:19:23,203
Nose told me that I got a habit when pitching on my first season off

305
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:26,203
after I received the King of Rookie and King of Save.

306
00:19:26,203 --> 00:19:28,103
I checked myself over and over.

307
00:19:28,103 --> 00:19:29,803
To the point of going neurotic.

308
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,203
But I couldn't find any habit.

309
00:19:33,203 --> 00:19:34,503
Not only that, I damaged my shoulder

310
00:19:34,503 --> 00:19:36,903
because of over pitching during the off season.

311
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:41,403
I thought that it was strange that after I resigned,

312
00:19:41,403 --> 00:19:43,003
Nose suddenly became very friendly

313
00:19:43,003 --> 00:19:46,903
and introduced me to TV jobs and such.

314
00:19:46,903 --> 00:19:48,303
Then last month,

315
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:49,303
after coincidentally seeing the VTR

316
00:19:49,303 --> 00:19:51,303
of a sports variety program before editing,

317
00:19:51,303 --> 00:19:54,303
I finally understood why he did so.

318
00:19:55,503 --> 00:19:58,303
Are there any other interesting stories?

319
00:19:58,303 --> 00:20:00,503
Mr. Nose, please tell us!

320
00:20:00,503 --> 00:20:05,203
Well, it's easy to get rid of a young pitcher.

321
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:07,103
All I did was whisper that he had a habit

322
00:20:07,103 --> 00:20:09,103
and he self-destructed.

323
00:20:09,103 --> 00:20:10,503
-What? -What?

324
00:20:10,503 --> 00:20:12,303
Cut the part out!

325
00:20:12,303 --> 00:20:13,403
I don't want trouble.

326
00:20:13,403 --> 00:20:14,703
Are you serious?

327
00:20:14,703 --> 00:20:17,503
No, it's something I heard from somebody else!

328
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:22,803
Yes, I never had a habit to begin with.

329
00:20:22,803 --> 00:20:24,903
But I felt obligated to him and swayed between joy and sorrow

330
00:20:24,903 --> 00:20:28,603
because he became the guardian of the Jaguars after me.

331
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:31,603
I supported him as if he was myself.

332
00:20:31,603 --> 00:20:34,003
That's why I'm so vexed and wretched.

333
00:20:34,003 --> 00:20:36,503
Is that why you killed him?

334
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:43,003
Yes. I kept him from making his Japan save record.

335
00:20:43,003 --> 00:20:46,503
Using Hideyoshi's "great revenge" trick.

336
00:20:46,503 --> 00:20:48,303
Because the real person to break the national record

337
00:20:48,303 --> 00:20:51,003
and have worldwide fame should have been me.

338
00:20:51,003 --> 00:20:53,703
I wanted to make him realize that!

339
00:20:55,703 --> 00:20:57,503
No.

340
00:20:57,503 --> 00:21:00,403
You would've never made the Japan record.

341
00:21:00,403 --> 00:21:02,003
What?

342
00:21:02,003 --> 00:21:05,303
I feel sorry for the fact that you were deceived

343
00:21:05,303 --> 00:21:09,303
but a stopper is the last stockade for the team.

344
00:21:09,303 --> 00:21:10,803
Even if you're beaten and battered,

345
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,903
no mattered if you're jeered at or what,

346
00:21:12,903 --> 00:21:14,803
if your turn to play comes up in the next game,

347
00:21:14,803 --> 00:21:18,203
you've got to stand on the mound as if nothing happened!

348
00:21:18,203 --> 00:21:21,803
I don't think a guy who loses himself

349
00:21:21,803 --> 00:21:25,603
and commits murder can shoulder the fate of a team.

350
00:21:27,403 --> 00:21:29,103
Pops.

351
00:21:29,103 --> 00:21:30,303
Dad.

352
00:21:32,403 --> 00:21:36,103
I'm the one who wants to cry!

353
00:21:36,103 --> 00:21:39,203
Thanks to you doing something like this.

354
00:21:39,203 --> 00:21:41,303
After I went all out to...

355
00:21:41,303 --> 00:21:42,803
No, forget it.

356
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:46,603
Do the rest of your repenting behind bars.

357
00:21:48,303 --> 00:21:50,903
What were you going to say, dad?

358
00:21:50,903 --> 00:21:52,503
It's nothing.

359
00:23:27,603 --> 00:23:28,703
Darn it.

360
00:23:35,203 --> 00:23:38,103

362
00:23:48,903 --> 00:23:50,603
No, wait a second.

363
00:23:50,603 --> 00:23:54,003
If this is going to be his final autograph,

364
00:23:54,003 --> 00:23:56,803
this is be a super rare item.

365
00:23:56,803 --> 00:23:58,503
Dad?

Finally in the next episode is the new semester

369
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,130
