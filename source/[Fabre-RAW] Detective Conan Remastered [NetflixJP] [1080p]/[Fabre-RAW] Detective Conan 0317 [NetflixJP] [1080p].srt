1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,540
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,440
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,140
The scene of the crime is filmed on videotape.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,340
Conan's deduction rips off the mask.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,040
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,840
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,860
Ran and I accompanied Pops on the job

9
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,360
to go see a professional wrestling match.

10
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,160
The main event of the day was

11
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,760
the title match between junior heavyweight champion, Wolf Face,

12
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,760
and the young ace, Hyota Nagase.

13
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,960
However, just before the match...

14
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,060
Hey, Nagase! Hey!

15
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,160
Hey, Nagase!

16
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,960
Hurry up and come out!

17
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,760
Mr. Nagase was killed in the waiting room!

18
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,260
Coincidentally, the scene of the crime was videotaped.

19
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,460
This is...

20
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,460
Wolf Face?

21
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,760
"The Sullied Masked Hero (Part 2)"

22
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,360
"Tohto Kokugikan"

23
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,660
Is it true that Wrestler Nagase was killed?

24
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,960
Tell us!

25
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,460
What happened with the police announcement?

26
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,860
All right then, from the person on the right,

27
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,460
please give me your name

28
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,760
and where you were around 7:20 pm.

29
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,760
Yeah.

30
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,360
"Iwao Ushigome (36)" -I'm Iwao Ushigome.

31
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,960
At around 7:20 pm,

32
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,660
I was watching the match Mr. Kiba was fighting.

33
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,560
Because he gets angry if I don't watch his match closely.

34
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,860
Is there anyone else who was watching with you?

35
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,260
No, I was alone.

36
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,360
Well, someone in the audience may have remembered seeing me,

37
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,860
but they were all absorbed in watching the match.

38
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,260
Same here, I was watching Mr. Kiba's match alone too.

39
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,160
"Hiroyuki Sakuma (25)" -My name is Hiroyuki Sakuma!

40
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,260
But right after Mr. Kiba's match,

41
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,260
I came to this room to get Mr. Nagase!

42
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,460
Because his match was right afterwards.

43
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,860
Are you sure?

44
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,060
It's true!

45
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,860
I heard this man say, "Nagase, hurry up and come out!"

46
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,360
But it's after the time the murder was committed.

47
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,360
Then, next, you, the one wearing the wolf mask!

48
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,860
I'd like you to remove your mask and talk to us.

49
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,060
Inspector, he doesn't speak Japanese.

50
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,460
Because Wolf Face is Mexican.

51
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,860
And besides,

52
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,760
he can't take off his mask in front of women and children.

53
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,660
It's fine, Sakuma.

54
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,960
"Takaharu Ogami (27)" -They already know who I am.

55
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,160
You're the one with the handsome face

56
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,260
but super weak wrestler, Takaharu Ogami?

57
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,060
Yes.

58
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,260
No way!

59
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,460
I saw you in the Tohto Sports Newspaper this morning too.

60
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,160
See! Here's a picture of you and Wolf side by side!

61
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,760
That's...

62
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,960
That's Sakuma!

63
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,260
He plays Wolf Face in my place to deceive

64
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,760
all the reporters and fans who come to the gym and the match grounds

65
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,460
trying to reveal the identity of Wolf Face!

66
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,860
I see...

67
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,760
But the mask that you just removed

68
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,460
and the mask in the picture

69
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,560
look somewhat slightly different.

70
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,360
That's the mask I use when I eat!

71
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,760
It's made of thinner material with less decorations on it,

72
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,660
and the opening of the mouth part is made larger to make eating easier!

73
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,760
I see.

74
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,160
But what a shock to find out that

75
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,760
the identity of Wolf Face is Wrestler Ogami.

76
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,060
Is this all right?

77
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,760
Aren't you the one who lost to Wolf Face

78
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,860
at Mascara Contra Mascara,

79
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,860
and vanished soon after the match, Leonardo Rossi?

80
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,260
"Leonardo Rossi (30)" -Yes!

81
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,460
Mascara?

82
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,660
Mascara Contra Mascara.

83
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,760
It's a match in which you fight to remove your opponent's mask!

84
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,360
The loser takes off his mask!

85
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,860
Well, what a surprise.

86
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,260
I thought that you resigned.

87
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,060
I'm more surprised that you know so much

88
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,060
about professional wrestling.

89
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,860
Leo had his mind set on resigning when he lost to me,

90
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,960
but Mr. Kiba convinced him otherwise.

91
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,560
And he debuted once again in Japan

92
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,960
wearing a Wolf Face mask with a different color.

93
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,360
Then, he gathered popularity as Wolf Face's shadow.

94
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,260
He was supposed to be the junior heavyweight challenger

95
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,560
after Nagase.

96
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,760
But who would've foreseen that anything like this would happen.

97
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,760
And? Where were you all around 7:20 pm?

98
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,760
Since it was just before I go out to fight the match,

99
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,860
I was alone doing warm-up exercises

100
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,260
in the waiting room of the foreign wrestlers.

101
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,960
All the other foreign wrestlers

102
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,260
had gone to see Mr. Kiba's match.

103
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,860
And were you watching Mr. Kiba's match too?

104
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,760
Yes.

105
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,760
Which means all four of you don't have an alibi.

106
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,560
No, Inspector!

107
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,560
This murder couldn't have been committed without Wolf Face's mask!

108
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,760
Which means that the killer is

109
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,360
one of the two who had free access

110
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,260
in and out of the foreigners' waiting room.

111
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:57,360
No, Wolf Face's masks are kept inside a bag

112
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,860
and hidden in the toilet where only authorized personnel have access,

113
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,560
so that we can wear the mask in secret.

114
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,460
If not, people will suspect me for being Wolf Face,

115
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,560
because they'll see me going in and out of the foreigners' waiting room.

116
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,760
I see...

117
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,760
Of course we handed the bag over to the forensic officers already.

118
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,260
Darn it!

119
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,660
Only if the victim left a dying message or something.

120
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,460
What's the matter, Ran?

121
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,760
Remember I said a while ago

122
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,760
about the professional wrestling skill that is popular in Karate club?

123
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,760
The name of the technique resembles Dying Message.

124
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,760
Maybe you're talking about Diving Body Attack?

125
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,360
The one that Mil Mascaras used to do!

126
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,660
Oh, well.

127
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,760
Then, what about Bruiser Brody's Flying Knee Drop

128
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,660
or Funk's Spinning Toe Hold?

129
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,660
If I'm not mistaken, it was the technique of a Japanese wrestler.

130
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,460
Then it must be Mr. Muto's...

131
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,860
Well, putting that aside.

132
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,860
We'll staying here a while longer and continuing investigations,

133
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,160
so I need all of you to wait in another room with Officer Takagi.

134
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Please say something!

135
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,360
Ran, take that brat with you and go outside too!

136
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,260
Okay!

137
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,060
I'm sorry, Officer Takagi.

138
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,460
No problem.

139
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,660
Is it true?

140
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,460
Wait!

141
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,560
Amazing. Look at the number of reporters here.

142
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,860
It's the wrestler that did the bloody match.

143
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,260
Are you all right, Mr. Kayama?

144
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,760
You look like a mummy.

145
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,660
It's you.

146
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,960
It's nothing.

147
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,460
By the way, is it true that Nagase was stabbed?

148
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,260
Yeah.

149
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,260
Hey, Officer Takagi.

150
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,860
I have two things I want to ask you.

151
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,860
What is it?

152
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,560
You know the mask man...

153
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,260
Yeah, that's right!

154
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,960
I heard that they're all that way in the beginning.

155
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,160
And all masks are more or less that way.

156
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,660
The same goes for Wolf Face's mask!

157
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,660
Conan, where are you going?

158
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,360
I forgot something!

159
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,460
What do you want?

160
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,060
I forgot something.

161
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,960
Now, where did I put it...

162
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,560
Inspector! We got a report from the forensic officer!

163
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,960
Okay!

164
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,960
The blood on the mask that was found in the restroom

165
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,260
was determined to be that of the victim's,

166
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,760
and the remnants of hair and eyebrows that were found inside of the mask

167
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,260
were the same as those found on the other Wolf Face masks,

168
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,860
Which means that the mask was worn

169
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,660
only by its original owner, Mr. Ogami.

170
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,460
And what about the victim's nails?

171
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,760
Although a thorough investigation was made,

172
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
nothing was found.

173
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,260
That's strange.

174
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,260
If he tried to tear the mask off,

175
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,960
the killer's skin or something should've been found left on his nails.

176
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,660
Just as I thought.

177
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,460
There's no mistake about it!

178
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,660
It's the one who couldn't become a wolf!

179
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,180
At any rate, Inspector!

180
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,680
It is an undeniable fact that inside of the Wolf Face's mask

181
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,480
that the killer was wearing while killing the victim,

182
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,580
only the hair and eyebrows of Wrestler Ogami were found.

183
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:03,580
We have no choice but to judge him to be the killer!

184
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,380
But even Mr. Ogami knew that

185
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,980
the TV station had set a video camera up in this room

186
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,680
where the murder was committed, right?

187
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,080
Why would he go out of his way to wear his mask and commit the crime,

188
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,580
knowing that it would draw suspicion to himself?

189
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,280
That's probably exactly what he was after.

190
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,080
He probably figured everyone would think so

191
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,780
and used it to his advantage.

192
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,680
Well, I think that if we call Ogami back here again,

193
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,880
he'll confess what he did!

194
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,980
Because he doesn't seem to be such a bad person to begin with.

195
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,480
What is this?

196
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,780
There's something strange about this mask!

197
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,880
See.

198
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,680
Look in the back of the mask that the killer was wearing.

199
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,580
In the back?

200
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:56,680
The design of the mask is different

201
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,580
from the one that Mr. Ogami was wearing a while ago.

202
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,980
Design?

203
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,780
You're right.

204
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,580
The mask a while ago had more fur at the back.

205
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,880
The mask in this video doesn't.

206
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,280
Then... Do you mean this mask is an imitation?

207
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,380
Probably a replica or something that was sold at stores for fans.

208
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,980
No, I don't think so.

209
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,580
Wrong!

210
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,880
This mask is the one

211
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,080
that was around when Wolf Face made his debut!

212
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,980
Mr. Ogami said that the old masks were also in the bag,

213
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,380
so the killer probably just happened to pick this old mask.

214
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:40,480
Hey, I thought I told you to keep an eye on the four suspects?

215
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,880
Well, Ran asked me to come check

216
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,680
because Conan didn't come back so...

217
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,980
Which means that the design of the mask

218
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,080
has nothing to do with the murder?

219
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,280
Yes, probably not.

220
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,480
So, he says.

221
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,680
So, that's...

222
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,480
Then what was that for, kid?

223
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,880
You idiot!

224
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,780
All you ever come up with

225
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:11,080
are ideas that confuse the investigation!

226
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,680
Understand?

227
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,180
I guess you're right.

228
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,380
No, wait.

229
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,480
I see! So that's what it was!

230
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,480
I'm sorry. After you change this room

231
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,380
according to my directions,

232
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,980
can you bring the four suspects in the other room here, please?

233
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,580
Don't tell me that...

234
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:41,980
So, shall we peel off the mask of the killer wolf

235
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:47,880
that stabbed Mr. Nagase to death in this room, Inspector?

236
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,180
Hey, look!

237
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,580
The four are going in again.

238
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:59,180
Just a while ago, Kogoro Mouri also went inside too.

239
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,480
Maybe the Sleeping Kogoro's deduction performance is about to begin?

240
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,480
We can't miss this.

241
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,580
Please let us interview you!

242
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,180
You're putting on a deduction performance, aren't you?

243
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,280
Let us in!

244
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,980
Officer Chiba, don't let anybody in!

245
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,280
Conan is still inside!

246
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,580
Just what is it with you officers?

247
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,980
Summoning us like this again.

248
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,280
Don't tell us you've figured out who the killer is?

249
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,180
Yeah, well sort of.

250
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,180
No, not just yet.

251
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,880
Hey! You just said a while ago that...

252
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,080
But, we'll soon find out.

253
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,580
All I need you to do is

254
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,780
to disguise yourself as Wolf like the killer did

255
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,980
and come walking toward me.

256
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:49,280
First, let's start with Mr. Ogami, who is Wolf Face himself.

257
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,680
Please wear that mask you are holding.

258
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,380
Please do as you are told.

259
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,180
Yes, sir.

260
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,180
Please come towards me.

261
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,080
Come a little more.

262
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,180
Closer.

263
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,980
What next?

264
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,980
Okay, that's fine.

265
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,880
Next, Mr. Sakuma!

266
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,080
Please take the mask from Mr. Ogami and do the same thing.

267
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,580
Yes, sir.

268
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,980
Inspector.

269
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,380
Do you notice any difference between the two?

270
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,380
No. Not at all.

271
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,580
Let us in!

272
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,380
Wait.

273
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,380
-Okay? -Yes.

274
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,280
Then, the last one, Mr. Ushigome.

275
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,480
Yeah.

276
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,580
I wear this and walk towards you, right?

277
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,280
Mr. Mouri.

278
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,180
I'm sure you have your reasons.

279
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,780
But unless you tell me where and how to look carefully,

280
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,380
I don't have the slightest idea.

281
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,480
Are you okay, mister?

282
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,580
It's me.

283
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,480
It's you, sonny.

284
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,180
I'm fine.

285
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,080
Will this do, Detective?

286
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,680
Yes. I more or less thought it would come out this way,

287
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,580
but now I'm positive.

288
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,280
That Mr. Ushigome...

289
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:54,880
You're the one who killed Mr. Nagase!

290
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,480
What?

291
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,380
It's the same

292
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,880
as the killer who was in the video.

293
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,280
He kept looking around!

294
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,080
Looking around?

295
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,480
Yes.

296
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,680
You'll find out when you wear it,

297
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,580
but a wrestler's mask has narrower vision than is actually thought to be!

298
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,280
Unless you're used to wearing it,

299
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,580
you tend to look around,

300
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,380
trying to make out the situation of the surroundings

301
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,680
or trip over things that are at your feet

302
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,080
because it is a blind spot.

303
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,580
In other words,

304
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,380
Mr. Ogami who is used to wearing the mask of Wolf Face,

305
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,080
Mr. Rossi who is used to wearing the mask of Nega Wolf

306
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,680
and Mr. Sakuma who usually pitches in for Mr. Ogami.

307
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,680
They have all been ruled out as suspects.

308
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,880
You're the only one who's not used to wearing the mask!

309
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,780
You mean I'm branded killer

310
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,880
just because I looked around and tripped!

311
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,880
The evidence is right there on the videotape!

312
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,580
Remember what Conan said about behind the mask a while ago.

313
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,780
Do you see that extra something?

314
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,180
There are four strings sticking out from behind the mask?

315
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,380
I get it!

316
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,980
The killer was wearing the thin mask

317
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,080
worn when having meals under another mask!

318
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,080
That way,

319
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,880
the hair and eyebrows of the killer won't stick to the inside of the mask

320
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,980
that has the blood splatters!

321
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,880
I see.

322
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,180
That's why although the victim tore half the mask off,

323
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,580
no remnants of skin of the killer

324
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,880
were found in the nails of the victim.

325
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,080
Isn't this the mask for meals that you're talking about?

326
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,380
It was sticking out of your pocket when you fell.

327
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,880
Oh, no.

328
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,680
That's the mask I keep in order to scare the young wrestlers

329
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,280
and not the one that the killer was wearing.

330
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,180
It's strange.

331
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,880
Wolf Face's mask is black and white,

332
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,580
but there's a red spot by the right eye.

333
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,180
Oh, I get it!

334
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,180
The right eye part of the mask that you were wearing on top got ripped

335
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,680
so the blood splattered on here!

336
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,380
You brat.

337
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,680
Okay, that's it!

338
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,380
We'll hear you out at the station.

339
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,480
Shut up!

340
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,080
Hey, Mr. Ushigome?

341
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,980
I'm telling you to shut up!

342
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,680
That's right.

343
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,580
I did it.

344
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,880
I killed the betrayer

345
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,580
who wanted to transfer to the Bankoku Pro Wrestling Team!

346
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,180
Cool it, Mr. Ushigome.

347
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,880
That's not all!

348
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,280
I was going to take the mask away from you by framing you up,

349
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,080
a young wrestler with no name, as the killer!

350
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,280
So that I become Wolf Face!

351
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,180
Didn't you hear a strange sound just now?

352
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,180
Right.

353
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,280
As long as I get to wear this mask I can become...

354
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,880
You can never become the Wolf!

355
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,780
You may be able to hide your face with the mask,

356
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,880
but you can't hide your heart that's full of soot and rotten to the gut,

357
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,680
having no respect for professional wrestling.

358
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,980
Excuse me...

359
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,580
Conan?

360
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,180
Kid, what do you know about me?

361
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,680
Stop it!

362
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,280
Shining Wizard?

363
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,380
Right, that's it!

364
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,580
That's the name of the technique!

365
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,880
I'm glad.

366
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,080
I finally remember the name!

367
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,780
And then after that,

368
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,780
the killer, Mr. Ushigome,

369
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,580
was slapped once in the cheek by a speechless Mr. Kiba.

370
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,780
He was then escorted

371
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,880
from the white mat to a dimly lit jail.

372
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,980
But things are going to get rough for you from now on.

373
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,880
The mass media is going to bash you from now on saying things like

374
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,780
you're a murderous professional wrestler and stuff.

375
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,680
I'll be fine.

376
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,480
We, wrestlers, are tough.

377
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,680
We're used to being bashed and hit.

378
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,280
So, I'll see you all then.

379
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,080
I wish you luck.

380
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,380
Yes.

381
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,080
They're the toughest guys around.

382
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,380
It's no problem for them to overcome difficulties like this.

383
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,980
And, so long as Wolf Face keeps on winning,

384
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,080
his identity will stay undercover.

385
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,280
Then you see, Mr. Ogami from the top rope.

386
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,780
Mr. Ogami?

387
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,080
I thought you were talking about Wolf Face?

388
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,480
So you know wolf! Mr. Wolf! (Ogami is Homonym of Wolf)

389
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,180
Because he's a wolf?

390
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,680
Yes...

391
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,980
Wolf Face's identity will probably

392
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,880
never be revealed.

393
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,380
I think.

394
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,820
"Next Episode"

395
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,560
Next Conan's Hint:
"Next Episode"

396
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:04,820
"Next Episode"

397
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,180
"Brake"
"Next Episode"

398
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,240
This is...
"Brake"

399
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:06,460
This is...

400
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:06,680
The stage of the next episode is in Izu.
This is...

401
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,780
Please move away!
The stage of the next episode is in Izu.

402
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:07,920
Please move away!

403
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,380
This is out of my jurisdiction.
Please move away!

404
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,300
Are you all right, Mr. Umetani?
This is out of my jurisdiction.

405
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:09,520
Are you all right, Mr. Umetani?

406
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,380
Mine too.
Are you all right, Mr. Umetani?

407
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:10,520
Mine too.

408
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,980
What? The knife fell out!

409
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,980
What's going on?

410
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,280
This is...

411
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,280
The knife poked into the cigar case!
