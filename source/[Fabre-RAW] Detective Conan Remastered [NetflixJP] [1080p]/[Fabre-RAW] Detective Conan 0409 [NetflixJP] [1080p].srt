1
00:00:05,249 --> 00:00:06,749
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:06,749 --> 00:00:08,449
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:08,449 --> 00:00:10,149
The heroine is kidnapped.

4
00:00:10,149 --> 00:00:11,649
Only a few hours are left until the curtain opens.

5
00:00:11,649 --> 00:00:13,649
Let's get at it, The Youth Detective Squad!

6
00:00:13,649 --> 00:00:15,349
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,049
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:19,049
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:01,324 --> 00:02:02,324
Be quiet!

10
00:02:02,324 --> 00:02:04,924
"Taketori Story" -Wait! Freeze!

11
00:02:06,624 --> 00:02:08,024
Stop there!

12
00:02:09,924 --> 00:02:12,124
Thief, give up!

13
00:02:12,124 --> 00:02:15,124
Oh, no! Please forgive me!

14
00:02:17,324 --> 00:02:19,424
Thank you, sir.

15
00:02:22,624 --> 00:02:24,024
Okay! Stop there!

16
00:02:24,024 --> 00:02:25,024
"Tamanosuke Ito (17), Tamanosuke Theatre Troupe Director"

17
00:02:25,024 --> 00:02:27,224
Everyone's pretty good!

18
00:02:27,224 --> 00:02:28,724
Really?

19
00:02:28,724 --> 00:02:32,024
"Megumi Ito (7)" -Especially Conan!

20
00:02:32,024 --> 00:02:36,024
Oh, thank you. I'm very happy!

21
00:02:36,024 --> 00:02:38,624
Hey, wait a minute. The two of you...

22
00:02:43,024 --> 00:02:44,724
Hey, Mr. Tamanosuke.

23
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:45,724
What?

24
00:02:45,724 --> 00:02:49,124
Are you sure you really want amateurs like us?

25
00:02:49,124 --> 00:02:50,324
Of course.

26
00:02:50,324 --> 00:02:54,924
This is a special performance different from our show,

27
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,024
the problem is not you but...

28
00:02:57,024 --> 00:02:58,024
What?

29
00:02:59,124 --> 00:03:00,624
I bought it yesterday.

30
00:03:00,624 --> 00:03:02,124
What are you slacking off for?

31
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:06,624
You don't need a stage to rehearse!

32
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,124
Sorry, director.

33
00:03:08,124 --> 00:03:10,724
"Renge Kataoka (17)" -Renge!

34
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,424
Don't open the script now!

35
00:03:12,424 --> 00:03:14,424
When do you think we started rehearsing?

36
00:03:16,424 --> 00:03:17,824
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:17,824 --> 00:03:19,424
Don't apologize so easily!

38
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:23,424
If you're not proud of your acting, quit being an actress!

39
00:03:23,424 --> 00:03:24,524
I'm...

40
00:03:24,524 --> 00:03:26,124
No, I mean, yes!

41
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:28,724
Scary, seems like a different person.

42
00:03:28,724 --> 00:03:32,324
No, Genta. That's what an actor is like.

43
00:03:32,324 --> 00:03:34,524
Impressive.

44
00:03:34,524 --> 00:03:38,924
By the way, don't you think Ms. Renge is a bit like Ran?

45
00:03:38,924 --> 00:03:40,424
What?

46
00:03:40,424 --> 00:03:42,524
Okay! Rehearsal begins!

47
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,024
Tamanosuke Ito.

48
00:03:46,024 --> 00:03:49,424
This young director leading the traveling theatrical troupe,

49
00:03:49,424 --> 00:03:52,624
comes to our town again and performs.

50
00:03:56,224 --> 00:04:02,024
"Concurrent Stage and Kidnapping (Part 1)"

51
00:04:02,024 --> 00:04:04,024
"Mouri Detective Agency"

52
00:04:04,024 --> 00:04:07,424
Ran! Hurry up!

53
00:04:08,524 --> 00:04:11,424
Tamanosuke's rehearsal will end!

54
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:15,824
But, I have to make lunch for my dad.

55
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:17,424
Leave it...

56
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,324
He's going to fall asleep drinking, right?

57
00:04:19,324 --> 00:04:20,924
Hey, Sonoko!

58
00:04:26,824 --> 00:04:28,324
Did I catch a cold?

59
00:04:32,124 --> 00:04:33,424
Or is it...

60
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,824
That?

61
00:04:35,824 --> 00:04:39,624
You think the detective maniac will mind?

62
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:40,724
What?

63
00:04:40,724 --> 00:04:42,224
Come to think of it...

64
00:04:42,224 --> 00:04:46,224
Tamanosuke does resemble him a little.

65
00:04:48,524 --> 00:04:50,324
I'm talking about Shinichi.

66
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:54,024
Really? I don't think so.

67
00:04:54,024 --> 00:04:57,724
By the way, the title is "Taketori Story".

68
00:04:57,724 --> 00:04:59,324
It's about Princess Kaguya, right?

69
00:04:59,324 --> 00:05:00,524
Right!

70
00:05:00,524 --> 00:05:05,124
And The Emperor that falls in love with Princess Kaguya is Tamanosuke.

71
00:05:05,124 --> 00:05:08,624
I want to be Princess Kaguya!

72
00:05:08,624 --> 00:05:10,724
Sonoko.

73
00:05:21,324 --> 00:05:23,524
What an expensive car.

74
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:24,824
Who is it?

75
00:05:26,924 --> 00:05:28,724
This way, president.

76
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:36,624
Gosh.

77
00:05:36,624 --> 00:05:38,824
Watch it! Excuse you!

78
00:05:42,124 --> 00:05:44,124
No, that isn't right!

79
00:05:46,924 --> 00:05:48,824
No way.

80
00:05:50,324 --> 00:05:53,724
I came for you, Renge.

81
00:05:53,724 --> 00:05:55,824
Come on! Come home with me!

82
00:05:57,124 --> 00:06:00,124
I'm not going home! I'm staying here!

83
00:06:00,124 --> 00:06:01,224
Renge!

84
00:06:03,024 --> 00:06:05,024
-Ohnuki. -Yes, sir.

85
00:06:09,524 --> 00:06:12,324
Let's go, Ms. Renge.

86
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:13,524
No!

87
00:06:16,824 --> 00:06:17,824
Let go of me!

88
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:19,324
Ms. Renge!

89
00:06:19,324 --> 00:06:21,724
What happened? What's it about?

90
00:06:21,724 --> 00:06:24,824
That girl plays Princess Kaguya.

91
00:06:26,524 --> 00:06:28,224
Wait a minute!

92
00:06:28,224 --> 00:06:31,824
What is this? Who are you?

93
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,124
"Hanshiro Kataoka (60)" -I am Hanshiro Kataoka.

94
00:06:34,124 --> 00:06:36,524
The father of Renge Kataoka.

95
00:06:36,524 --> 00:06:37,624
What?

96
00:06:39,124 --> 00:06:41,124
"Hikoemon Bando(50)" -Kataoka...

97
00:06:41,124 --> 00:06:42,724
"Kikuno Ichimura(40)" -Hanshiro...

98
00:06:42,724 --> 00:06:45,124
Isn't he...

99
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:47,724
He's the founder of the Kataoka Concern

100
00:06:47,724 --> 00:06:50,024
and is the current president.

101
00:06:50,024 --> 00:06:52,024
What? Then...

102
00:06:52,024 --> 00:06:54,324
She's a lady from rich family.

103
00:06:54,324 --> 00:06:55,624
Amazing!

104
00:06:55,624 --> 00:07:00,124
Renge, you didn't say a word of this to anyone.

105
00:07:00,124 --> 00:07:02,224
But...

106
00:07:02,224 --> 00:07:03,824
That has nothing to do with this!

107
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:07,824
This has nothing to do with me wanting to act!

108
00:07:07,824 --> 00:07:09,324
That's...

109
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:12,124
By any chance, Renge...

110
00:07:12,124 --> 00:07:13,224
Did you run away?

111
00:07:16,724 --> 00:07:19,324
I haven't heard from her for six months.

112
00:07:19,324 --> 00:07:23,524
I asked Ohnuki to look for.

113
00:07:23,524 --> 00:07:24,824
"Mataroku Onoue (35)" -What a surprise.

114
00:07:24,824 --> 00:07:27,824
"Yoichi Azuma (28)" -Well, we're not much different from you.

115
00:07:27,824 --> 00:07:31,224
This profession makes it hard to do anything for our parents.

116
00:07:31,224 --> 00:07:32,424
"Kantaro Sawamura (23)" -True...

117
00:07:32,424 --> 00:07:36,624
But I think it's not good to make them worry, after all.

118
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:38,324
-Ohnuki. -Yes, sir.

119
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,724
"Shuichi Ohnuki (38)" -Let us go, Ms. Renge.

120
00:07:40,724 --> 00:07:42,624
I don't want to! I'm not going home.

121
00:07:42,624 --> 00:07:46,324
-I'm definitely won't be going home! -Ms. Renge!

122
00:07:46,324 --> 00:07:47,524
Ohnuki!

123
00:07:47,524 --> 00:07:50,124
Yes, sir. Sorry to have troubled you.

124
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:54,824
We would like to do what is appropriate for everyone here.

125
00:07:55,924 --> 00:07:57,824
I don't want anything from you.

126
00:07:57,824 --> 00:07:59,624
I have no business doing so.

127
00:07:59,624 --> 00:08:02,324
Director!

128
00:08:02,324 --> 00:08:04,724
Go home now, Renge.

129
00:08:08,424 --> 00:08:12,824
Renge! Go home once and come back after you talk things over.

130
00:08:17,424 --> 00:08:18,824
Wait a minute, director!

131
00:08:18,824 --> 00:08:21,824
There won't be time for the rehearsal and plan.

132
00:08:21,824 --> 00:08:24,524
The first day is three days from today.

133
00:08:24,524 --> 00:08:26,424
True, it won't do.

134
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:30,724
But it won't do to leave things like this.

135
00:08:30,724 --> 00:08:32,124
You're right.

136
00:08:35,624 --> 00:08:37,724
Go home now, Renge.

137
00:08:37,724 --> 00:08:39,624
-Wait! -Ms. Renge!

138
00:08:39,624 --> 00:08:43,324
Please wait, director! I...

139
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:46,424
Ran, can you come here?

140
00:08:46,424 --> 00:08:48,524
What? Okay...

141
00:08:48,524 --> 00:08:52,024
Someone bring the costume for Princess Kaguya and the props!

142
00:08:53,424 --> 00:08:55,424
Hey, hey, come on.

143
00:08:55,424 --> 00:08:56,824
Are you kidding?

144
00:08:56,824 --> 00:09:00,024
Ran is going to substitute for Ms. Renge!

145
00:09:00,024 --> 00:09:01,724
No, no way!

146
00:09:01,724 --> 00:09:06,024
You're right, we need Kaguya for the rehearsal and planning.

147
00:09:06,024 --> 00:09:08,324
To make it in time for the first day.

148
00:09:08,324 --> 00:09:10,624
So until then?

149
00:09:10,624 --> 00:09:12,824
Well, it can't be helped.

150
00:09:12,824 --> 00:09:14,124
True.

151
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:16,024
Okay, let's do the rehearsal!

152
00:09:19,724 --> 00:09:20,824
Ms. Renge!

153
00:09:32,424 --> 00:09:34,724
Wasn't that a little cold...

154
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:36,024
Who the director?

155
00:09:37,824 --> 00:09:39,024
True.

156
00:09:39,024 --> 00:09:40,524
You're wrong.

157
00:09:40,524 --> 00:09:44,324
The director believes in Renge that she will return.

158
00:09:44,324 --> 00:09:46,624
That's right, that is obvious.

159
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,024
So pretty, Ran.

160
00:09:54,024 --> 00:09:55,824
She's really pretty!

161
00:09:55,824 --> 00:09:58,024
She should actually act out in the play!

162
00:09:58,024 --> 00:09:59,524
I agree.

163
00:09:59,524 --> 00:10:00,724
Hey...

164
00:10:02,024 --> 00:10:04,924
But I don't think that's such a good idea.

165
00:10:04,924 --> 00:10:06,024
See.

166
00:10:07,224 --> 00:10:08,624
What?

167
00:10:09,824 --> 00:10:11,224
A love scene!

168
00:10:13,424 --> 00:10:14,924
Maybe this...

169
00:10:14,924 --> 00:10:17,724
Ran and Tamanosuke...

170
00:10:17,724 --> 00:10:19,124
Not good...

171
00:10:19,124 --> 00:10:24,424
I'm glad the detective maniac isn't watching.

172
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:25,524
I'm watching.

173
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:29,624
Hey, besides that, why isn't it me?

174
00:10:31,124 --> 00:10:34,224
But Ms. Renge did not return.

175
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:42,624
And the first day of the performance arrives.

176
00:10:42,624 --> 00:10:46,024
"Taketori Story"

177
00:10:51,624 --> 00:10:53,424
Three more hours...

178
00:10:54,524 --> 00:10:58,424
We have come too far not to open the curtain.

179
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,424
Without the protagonist?

180
00:11:02,724 --> 00:11:04,424
Director...

181
00:11:04,424 --> 00:11:05,724
What are we going to do?

182
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:09,424
I'm going to go get her.

183
00:11:10,524 --> 00:11:12,324
Go and get her...

184
00:11:12,324 --> 00:11:13,924
Renge?

185
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:16,724
It's going to be difficult with that father...

186
00:11:16,724 --> 00:11:20,524
Maybe she changed her mind and doesn't want to come back.

187
00:11:20,524 --> 00:11:24,224
No way... What's going to happen to this play?

188
00:11:24,224 --> 00:11:26,024
We will have to cancel it.

189
00:11:26,024 --> 00:11:28,624
I haven't heard of a "Taketori Story" without Kaguya.

190
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:32,524
I'm going.

191
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:33,824
Director!

192
00:11:43,724 --> 00:11:45,624
Wait, Mr. Tamanosuke!

193
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:46,624
What?

194
00:11:48,024 --> 00:11:52,224
I have something to say to Ms. Renge as a substitute.

195
00:11:52,224 --> 00:11:53,924
Mr. Driver, please hurry!

196
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,524
"Kataoka"

197
00:12:10,624 --> 00:12:11,824
Conan!

198
00:12:15,524 --> 00:12:17,824
Hey, Officer Takagi...

199
00:12:23,624 --> 00:12:25,324
Hey, you two!

200
00:12:25,324 --> 00:12:27,724
How come you're here?

201
00:12:27,724 --> 00:12:29,324
Dad?

202
00:12:29,324 --> 00:12:30,924
Officer Takagi.

203
00:12:30,924 --> 00:12:32,324
I'm sorry.

204
00:12:32,324 --> 00:12:34,824
There's no knowing where the culprit could be watching

205
00:12:34,824 --> 00:12:37,224
so I had to let them in.

206
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:38,224
Culprit?

207
00:12:40,124 --> 00:12:43,024
It's you. What do you want?

208
00:12:44,124 --> 00:12:46,124
There's only one thing!

209
00:12:46,124 --> 00:12:48,724
Where is she? Where's Renge?

210
00:12:50,224 --> 00:12:51,624
I...

211
00:12:51,624 --> 00:12:56,424
I was thinking she is at your place.

212
00:12:56,424 --> 00:12:57,924
What?

213
00:12:57,924 --> 00:13:01,124
I don't know where she is since last night.

214
00:13:01,124 --> 00:13:03,324
She said she was going shopping.

215
00:13:05,624 --> 00:13:06,924
What?

216
00:13:06,924 --> 00:13:08,924
Dad, what's going on?

217
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:11,624
You keep out of this!

218
00:13:16,724 --> 00:13:18,324
Conan!

219
00:13:18,324 --> 00:13:20,024
Hey, stop it!

220
00:13:21,224 --> 00:13:23,224
"Ransom money".

221
00:13:23,224 --> 00:13:25,224
"1,500,000 yen"?

222
00:13:25,224 --> 00:13:26,724
Ms. Renge!

223
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:28,624
"Divide the money with Imai Electronics,"

224
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:35,024
"Kato Network and Nakao Media accordingly"

225
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:37,724
"Have the money ready by 2 pm"

226
00:13:37,724 --> 00:13:39,324
"And let a secretary carry it"

227
00:13:39,324 --> 00:13:42,724
"To the parking lot at first block of Yoshioka."

228
00:13:42,724 --> 00:13:44,624
Ransom...

229
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:45,824
Is it...

230
00:13:47,224 --> 00:13:48,424
Kidnapping!

231
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:01,510
Then... It was just an hour ago?

232
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,310
That they sent this blackmail letter was sent?

233
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,510
Yes.

234
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,010
Originator?

235
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,010
This is quite some trouble.

236
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,910
This is used in international crimes

237
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,710
and the method has become a problem all over the world.

238
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,510
Mr. Kataoka.

239
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:22,610
The demand of this division of the ransom...

240
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,710
Ohnuki.

241
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,810
Yes.

242
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:29,910
All the three companies in demand has had recent transaction with us.

243
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,410
But why these three companies?

244
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,810
That is...

245
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,610
It's okay, explain.

246
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,910
Yes.

247
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:43,610
Well, the managers of these three companies have all asked

248
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,810
for a hand in marriage with Ms. Renge.

249
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,510
Well, that's like...

250
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:05,610
That's right! Snow White!

251
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,810
Dad! You mean Princess Kaguya!

252
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,310
Yeah, that's right. Some people call her that, too.

253
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,810
That's the only name people call her.

254
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,310
What is it?

255
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,810
Something is bugging me.

256
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,610
Excuse me.

257
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,210
Tell them to leave!

258
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,810
I don't want to hear any excuses!

259
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,110
What's wrong?

260
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:46,410
As a matter of fact, one of the suitors I mentioned,

261
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:50,510
due to situations at the company can't get the ransom ready.

262
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,010
That's a lie!

263
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,510
They just don't want any trouble and scandal!

264
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,010
How dare, they weigh my daughter, Renge's life,

265
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,310
with that of the company's reputation.

266
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:04,710
-I won't forgive them! -But, what will happen to the ransom money?

267
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,710
I already have it ready.

268
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:09,410
I have their company name on the outside.

269
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,910
But I'm not giving my daughter away to them!

270
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,610
Drop out from the wooing race?

271
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,510
This is becoming more and more...

272
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,310
Please forgive me.

273
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,910
Snow white...

274
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,410
Princess Kaguya!

275
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,910
That's it!

276
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:38,810
Meanwhile, we have received the money from the other two.

277
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:42,210
As soon as it's time, I will carry it to the destination.

278
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,710
We must agree with their terms.

279
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,510
And see what they will do afterwards...

280
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,210
We, the police will go about the investigation

281
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:55,410
with the rescue of your daughter as top priority.

282
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,010
Thank you.

283
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,310
What?

284
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,310
This is...

285
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,910
The image was cut once probably

286
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,310
to make the halation disappear.

287
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:23,710
The kidnapper stopped the camera and closed the window.

288
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,410
No, wait. This is...

289
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,710
There's something there.

290
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,710
Is that spider web?

291
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:36,610
No, then the position isn't right.

292
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,410
This place...

293
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:43,210
This place looks familiar.

294
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,010
-What? -Hey!

295
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,810
How many times do I have to tell you, you brat?

296
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,210
Dad!

297
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,410
I'm sorry.

298
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,310
Darn it, I almost made it.

299
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,710
Kidnapped?

300
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,210
Ms. Renge?

301
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,110
I'll have to be here for awhile.

302
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,710
Ayumi, how is it down there?

303
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,510
Everyone doesn't know what to do.

304
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,910
There's only one hour until the curtain goes up...

305
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,810
What should we do, Conan?

306
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,210
Do something...

307
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,710
Sonoko?

308
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,010
Gosh...

309
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,310
You shouldn't go off on your own here and there.

310
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,610
Get rid of the cobweb yourself!

311
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,410
I'm asking you because I can't do it myself!

312
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,310
I hate spiders!

313
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,610
Myself? I can't do it myself...

314
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,510
That's it, I got it!

315
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,910
False kidnapping?

316
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,010
Renge did it herself?

317
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,610
Why would she want to do that...

318
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:28,010
Maybe she wanted to ruin the talk about marriage?

319
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,310
What's that supposed to mean?

320
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,410
I don't really know

321
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,310
but probably the reason for asking for ransom

322
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:36,110
from the people who proposed to her...

323
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,810
Was her way of wanting to relate how she felt to her father

324
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,610
in accordance to the story of Princess Kaguya?

325
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,610
Right, I think so too!

326
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,810
But that's no excuse for her to do such a thing!

327
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,010
Little one!

328
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,710
Renge is at the warehouse, right?

329
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,510
Yes, probably...

330
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,610
It's probably there!

331
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,310
-What? -Let's go!

332
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,110
-Wait up! -Tamanosuke!

333
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:22,310
This is the storage warehouse for the costumes and props that we rented,

334
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,110
Renge should have the key too.

335
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,410
This place must be it.

336
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,210
Don't you think we should tell dad?

337
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,810
But there's no sign of anyone.

338
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,010
Renge!

339
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,610
Ms. Renge!

340
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,910
I knew it...

341
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,510
This!

342
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,010
Renge!

343
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:13,710
And at this instant, the false kidnap became a real one!

344
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:22,610
Somehow, Ms. Renge really got kidnapped.

345
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,710
The culprit is probably

346
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:29,810
the other person who helped with her false kidnapping!

347
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,510
I'll be going.

348
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,910
What? Where's Ran and the others?

349
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,210
Where did they go?

350
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,610
Inspector, they're going.

351
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:53,810
Okay.

352
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,810
And the case moves on...

353
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:32,010
The curtain for the play has also gone up!

354
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,937
Next Conan's Hint:

355
00:24:33,937 --> 00:24:36,237
"Phone call from the culprit"

356
00:24:36,237 --> 00:24:37,937
In the next story, I am the Princess Kaguya.

357
00:24:37,937 --> 00:24:39,637
-Thank you for your hard work! -Thank you for your hard work!

358
00:24:39,637 --> 00:24:41,037
What?
