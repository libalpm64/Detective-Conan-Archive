1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,840
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,540
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,640
Deductions take all shapes and styles in each and every case to be solved.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,540
Today's episode is at a hospital. Kogoro is surprised

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,240
and Ran is acting strange too.

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,540
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,640
Yeah. I can't come home for a while yet.

10
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,140
Gee, what on earth are you doing?

11
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,240
All the others in class are also worried about you too.

12
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,040
I've got no choice.

13
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,540
"I'm handling a dangerous and difficult case", right?

14
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,440
-Uh, you know what. -Oh, I'm sorry, Shinichi.

15
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,440
I have something to do and got to go.

16
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,840
Bye, then, and take care because it's getting cold.

17
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,540
There's something...

18
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,340
something strange about Ran recently.

19
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,740
She seems to be giving me the cold shoulder when I call her.

20
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,340
She's not raving, "Shinichi, Shinichi"

21
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,040
like she used to before either.

22
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,340
And, the strangest thing is...

23
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,540
Conan.

24
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,440
I'm going out for a while.

25
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,840
I left your dinner on the table,

26
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,040
so warm it up with the micro-wave before you eat it, okay?

27
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,240
Oh, okay.

28
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,440
She recently goes out in the evenings almost everyday.

29
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,340
Although Ran says she's going to karate lessons.

30
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,840
Something bothers me about the way she looks so happy.

31
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,040
"Blind Spot in the Darkness (Part 1)"

32
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,840
One day...

33
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,340
What?

34
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,440
You were going to the hospital?

35
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,640
Yeah. I'm going to get the results of the test now.

36
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,740
Is something wrong with you?

37
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,840
I feel a bit tired recently.

38
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,240
You're probably drinking too much.

39
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,540
Right.

40
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,340
I don't see why you have to take us with you

41
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,540
when we just came back from school.

42
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,740
Why make such a big thing of it?

43
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,040
The doctor told me to bring my family along

44
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,440
when I go to the hospital.

45
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,140
Hey, don't tell me that you...

46
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,340
Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

47
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,340
Mr. Mouri.

48
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,440
Another six months.

49
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,040
I know exactly how you feel but, unfortunately

50
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,440
for the next six months have to...

51
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,040
Hey, you! How cruel can you get?

52
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,440
Suddenly telling me that I only have another six months to live!

53
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,940
If I'm that seriously ill, isn't it only manners

54
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,040
for you as a doctor to give it to me slowly?

55
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,140
Huh?

56
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,840
Seriously ill?

57
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,540
I just wanted to tell you to stay away from alcoholic drinks

58
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,740
for the next six months.

59
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,640
Huh?

60
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,740
Alcohol?

61
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,040
Yes. The results of the tests show that

62
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,440
you have kidney trouble caused by over drinking.

63
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,340
Although the symptoms are still very slight.

64
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,540
Just as I thought.

65
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,940
Dr. Araide, you really scared me.

66
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,340
Telling me to bring my family along with me.

67
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,440
For a person like you who likes alcoholic drinks,

68
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,740
the cooperation of your family is a must.

69
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,140
Please reduce your daily intake of alcoholic beverages.

70
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,140
Yes, I'll make him quit drinking for good.

71
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,340
You have a call from Ms. Sugita.

72
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,940
She's asking you to give her a house call.

73
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,940
Not again.

74
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,640
What a troublesome patient.

75
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,140
All she's got is plain ulcers, but she's such a worrier.

76
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,640
"Yoko Araide (46)" -Patient?

77
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,340
"Yoshiteru's wife" -Good grief. She's his lover.

78
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,440
Oh, it's nothing.

79
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,840
He'll be through in a little while, so please wait here a minute.

80
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,140
Excuse me.

81
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,340
May I use the restroom?

82
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,740
The restroom for patients is broken.

83
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,940
My.

84
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,740
I turned right at the corridor so...

85
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,640
It's this way.

86
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,040
Yes, the examination room is right up ahead.

87
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,640
Gee, what a large house this is.

88
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,540
I'm sorry, I wasn't watching where I was going.

89
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,440
Oh, no, it's my fault for being absent-minded.

90
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,440
Okay, that's all.

91
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,140
Oh, thank you.

92
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,140
Uh, who are you?

93
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,640
I'm Kogoro Mouri's daughter, one of the doctor's patients.

94
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,140
Oh. Mr. Mouri's daughter.

95
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,440
And, I'm the son of that doctor.

96
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,040
I'm Tomoaki and share the work of examining the patients here

97
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,340
together with my father.

98
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,140
But, I'm going to be working at a hospital in Aomori

99
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,140
starting next month.

100
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,940
Hey! Don't tell me it's you again!

101
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,440
How long is it going to take you to get used to this house anyway?

102
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,440
You're the one who wanted to be maid here, right?

103
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,040
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,840
Come now, father,

105
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,940
getting too excited is bad for your heart.

106
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,940
Listen. If you do something like this one more time,

107
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,140
you're fired, understand?

108
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,840
Hopeless scatterbrain, I tell you.

109
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,440
"Hikaru Yasumoto (22), Housemaid"

110
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,840
Thank you very much.

111
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,240
Keep away from drinking and live long.

112
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,240
After all, you have the same name as the famous Kogoro Mouri.

113
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,240
Oh, you've never heard of the renown detective?

114
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,640
Uh, no, so, you see...

115
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,440
What? You're the famous detective!

116
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,740
Yes.

117
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,740
Well, I was wondering from the time I saw your name,

118
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,540
but you're him in person, eh.

119
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,140
I was completely deceived,

120
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,840
because you acted like you knew nothing about medicine.

121
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,240
How about having dinner over at our house tonight?

122
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,040
Let's talk about medicine, the two of us.

123
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,140
Oh, no!

124
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,040
No. I've got homework to do,

125
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,440
and Ran has karate practice too.

126
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,640
Right?

127
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,140
Why not? Let's have dinner here.

128
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:39,240
Resting one lesson couldn't possibly hurt.

129
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,740
Something...

130
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,840
Something's strange, after all.

131
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,240
"Clinic Araide"

132
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,840
You graduated with honors from Tohto University, Tomoaki?

133
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,040
Fantastic.

134
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,940
True, isn't it, Tomoaki?

135
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,540
I was just lucky.

136
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,240
How about thinking of marrying my daughter?

137
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,240
Come on, dad!

138
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,940
My, I think you two make quite a nice pair.

139
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,140
Oh, please knock it off, Mom.

140
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,340
Ouch!

141
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,240
Are you all right? Please be careful since chawanmushi is hot.

142
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,640
I'm sorry.

143
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,740
Is it all right?

144
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,590
Weren't supposed to have a a meeting tonight about your class reunion?

145
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,690
Oh, that's right. I have to call Masae.

146
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,390
Well, if you want to marry her, let me know anytime.

147
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:30,190
If we join hands, we will indeed be like Holmes and Watson.

148
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,590
Every case will be solved in no time.

149
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,090
Give me a break.

150
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,090
Besides, I don't think that a detective and a doctor

151
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,390
make a good pair.

152
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,790
Our mission as doctors is not to perform an autopsy

153
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,690
so that the killer can be arrested,

154
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,690
but rather, to save the victim's life.

155
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,190
Oh, you got me there.

156
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,390
No.

157
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:56,090
It's hard to tell who Holmes is, isn't it, Ran...

158
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,790
Ran.

159
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,790
Dr. Araide sure is late.

160
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,590
He should already be finished working.

161
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,390
He's taking a bath.

162
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:14,290
He has a habit of taking a bath before dinner.

163
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,890
He goes in before everybody else and dirties the water.

164
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,690
Grandma, that's not nice.

165
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,190
He sure is the bread winner of this house

166
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,790
to be the first to take a bath.

167
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,990
Some bread winner!

168
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:31,590
All he did was take after the family, and yet he acts so big.

169
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,890
Grandma!

170
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:36,190
The only person that is related by blood in this house

171
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,190
is you, my grandson.

172
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,190
And to think that you're going to be leaving this house

173
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,390
at the end of this month...

174
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,590
Are you telling me that I should die?

175
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,390
Grandma.

176
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,490
Oh, Mother, what about dinner?

177
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,490
No thanks,

178
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,790
why don't all you strangers enjoy dinner together?

179
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,790
Don't let it bother you.

180
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,590
Grandma is upset because father changed the toilet and bath tub

181
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,690
from Japanese style to Western style.

182
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,290
Western style?

183
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,490
Yes.

184
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,990
She was especially enraged when he changed

185
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,890
the white cedar bath tub to one with a shower curtain.

186
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,190
She shouted saying,

187
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,090
"Are you trying to dirt on the tradition of this house?"

188
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,390
Well, she sure is an energetic elderly woman.

189
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,390
Oh no. A black out?

190
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,090
It seems that the black out is only in this house.

191
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,390
The lights of the house next door are on.

192
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,790
Are you all right?

193
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,290
I'm sure there's a flashlight in that drawer over there.

194
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:36,890
Here it is.

195
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,190
I'll go check the breaker.

196
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,290
Can you handle it?

197
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,490
Yes.

198
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,840
Watch your step, Hikaru.

199
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,240
Okay.

200
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,540
What's up? What happened?

201
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,140
There was a black out.

202
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,840
Oh, no, isn't this the sound of rain?

203
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
Yes.

204
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,840
Bummers.

205
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,240
Oh, the lights are on.

206
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,940
I'm sorry. I thought you were dad.

207
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,140
What on earth is going on?

208
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,440
Oh, mother.

209
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,540
And about the charges...

210
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,290
Well, I think 30,000 yen is a bit too expensive.

211
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,690
Did the lights turn on?

212
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,290
You idiot. Can't you see for yourself?

213
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,590
Maybe you'd better go check on how father is doing?

214
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,790
He's probably angry that the lights went out

215
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,790
and besides, I'm worried about his heart too.

216
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,390
-I guess so. -I'll go check then.

217
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,290
Oh, I'll go too.

218
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,490
Why did it black out?

219
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,990
I wonder.

220
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,890
Probably a short circuit somewhere or the fuse blew out.

221
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,490
What is it?

222
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,190
It's from the bath tub.

223
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,590
Father!

224
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,080
Father!

225
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,480
Don't touch him!

226
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,380
Huh?

227
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,580
If you touch him, you'll be electrocuted too.

228
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,680
Electrocuted?

229
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,580
Hey, come on, don't tell that...

230
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,180
He was killed because of this razor

231
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,180
that is connected to the extension cord.

232
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,180
I'm going to try CPR!

233
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,380
Mother, please prepare an I.V with cardiotonic drug!

234
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,580
Hikaru, call the ambulance!

235
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,080
Hurry!

236
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,180
-Yes! -Oh, and call the police too!

237
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,980
Okay!

238
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,080
There seems to be no doubt that

239
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,580
this extension cord got soaked in the water

240
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,480
and he was electrocuted.

241
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,780
He used the mirror above the bath tub

242
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,380
when he shaved using the razor.

243
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,880
But, why did he shave while bathing?

244
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,280
Wait a minute, don't tell me that this is...

245
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,880
Unfortunately.

246
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,980
Mr. Yoshiteru Araide has passed away.

247
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,780
He did have a weak heart to begin with.

248
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,680
Oh, no...

249
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,780
And?

250
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,280
Under what circumstances was Mr. Yoshiteru Araide found?

251
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,380
Oh, well...

252
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,180
His head was faced this way, and he was slack.

253
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,880
I wonder why he used his electric shaver

254
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,680
while soaking in the tub.

255
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,680
He had a habit of doing so.

256
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,880
He always shaved while making his guest wait.

257
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,780
The mirror has had a special coating put on it to prevent fogging.

258
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,080
What a strange habit,

259
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,980
to take a bath while his guests are waiting.

260
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,580
Father liked to take a bath

261
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,380
and he always took a twice a day,

262
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,080
in the morning and before dinner,

263
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,580
saying that sanitation was a must for doctors.

264
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,080
It serves him right.

265
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,280
The heavens punished him for not taking heed of Chiaki's warning.

266
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,680
This is probably chastisement from Chiaki

267
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,080
who is in the world beyond.

268
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,680
Grandma.

269
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,880
Chiaki...

270
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,880
She's my mother who died in a traffic accident 4 years ago.

271
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,380
Chiaki always warn him about using the electric shaver

272
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,480
when taking a bath saying,

273
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,880
"Don't use it with the cord on because it's dangerous."

274
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,780
And you, Yoko?

275
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,380
I'm his second wife and married him two years ago.

276
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,680
I used to be in the same class as Chiaki in nurse school,

277
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,280
and she used to complain to me a lot.

278
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,580
Inspector, please watch.

279
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,380
He tries to shave using this mirror,

280
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,080
the part where the shaver is plugged into the extension cord

281
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,180
stops on the edge of the tub.

282
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,680
Very dangerous indeed.

283
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,280
Where were you all during a black out?

284
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,880
We were all in the kitchen.

285
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,280
I saw mother go up the stairs by the corridor

286
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,980
opposite the bathroom too.

287
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,980
If so, then the only likely conclusion would be that

288
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,680
Mr. Araide mistakenly pulled the cord of the shaver into the water

289
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,780
while was shaving, and electrocuted.

290
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,480
This is an accidental death.

291
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,980
I guess so.

292
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,080
Hey. Cut out that mischief!

293
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,080
But, my head is messed up and feel like falling down.

294
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,780
Huh? Why?

295
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,380
Well, the man who died was shaving standing up,

296
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,380
and Officer Takagi was copying him, right?

297
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,580
If so, when he got electric shock,

298
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,280
his head is supposed to come this way like Officer Takagi, right?

299
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,580
But, that man's head was faced the other way.

300
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,780
I wonder why?

301
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,180
That's true.

302
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,580
Hey, this may probably be...

303
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,680
No big deal.

304
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,180
While Mr. Araide was shaving,

305
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,280
he realized that the cord was going to fall into the water

306
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,380
and rushed to pick it up,

307
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,080
but he pulled it into the tub instead.

308
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,080
He then touched the railing accidentally

309
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,580
and was electrocuted.

310
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,480
So, you see.

311
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,380
Pretty good, Pops.

312
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,980
No. Don't touch that.

313
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,480
The razor is vital proof, isn't it?

314
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,880
Touch it? I'm just holding it.

315
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,480
How about you, Officer Takagi?

316
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,280
No, I only held it in my hand too.

317
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,180
How about the Investigation Officer?

318
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,980
I just took pictures.

319
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,280
Strange. Then I wonder who played such a bad prank like this.

320
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,380
Just what are you trying to get at?

321
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,580
Because look, the switch of the razor is turned off.

322
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,580
Huh?

323
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,580
What's going on?

324
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,680
It is strange after all.

325
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,080
If he was electrocuted while shaving,

326
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,780
the switch would have to be on.

327
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:09,780
The switch must've moved when you fell.

328
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,080
Like so...

329
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,580
Huh? The plug should've been pulled out to avoid danger.

330
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,680
Yes, I have it right here.

331
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,080
I see. This is the battery charge type.

332
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,680
Then, why was it switched off?

333
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,980
It wasn't moving when the body was found, was it?

334
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,280
No.

335
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,380
I think that's only natural.

336
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,580
Somebody didn't want the noise of the shaver to be heard.

337
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,680
Huh? Who didn't want it to be heard by who?

338
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:46,380
Beats me. I'm just making guesses.

339
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,480
Maybe so that someone could put the cord into the tub

340
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,680
without Mr. Araide noticing?

341
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,180
You idiot!

342
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,180
He'd notice if you did something like that,

343
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,180
even if the shaver wasn't making any noise.

344
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:03,880
Besides, everyone has an alibi when the house blacked out.

345
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,980
When the lights went on,

346
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,980
it turned off once then went on again, right?

347
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,280
Hikaru?

348
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,180
You were the one who went to lift the breaker, weren't you?

349
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,280
Yes.

350
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,780
Did you lift the breaker twice back then?

351
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:26,380
Oh, I'm sorry. I seem to have touched the wrong switch.

352
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,380
The breaker of another place seems to have been lowered,

353
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,280
so I put it back again right away.

354
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,880
I'm really sorry.

355
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,480
Inspector, the second one was the overload current breaker.

356
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,280
Maybe this is...

357
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,080
Yeah.

358
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,180
Maybe a timer was rigged so that there would be a black out,

359
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,780
and if someone went into the bathroom

360
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,680
to sneak the electric cord into the tub,

361
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,780
anyone of those four could've done so.

362
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,980
It's possible.

363
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,480
Uh, what are you whispering about?

364
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,080
Oh, no, it's nothing.

365
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,380
I would like to confirm your alibis before the black out occurred,

366
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,580
just in case.

367
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,280
We just gave you our alibis a while ago.

368
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,580
Huh? Are you saying that the killer is among us?

369
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,980
Like I just said I'm doing so, just in case.

370
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,180
Oh, you were on the phone all through the black out?

371
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,980
Yes. From the time before the black out

372
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,580
till the lights went back on,

373
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:25,580
I was on the phone by the kitchen entrance.

374
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,980
I was talking to my friend, Masae

375
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,580
about arrangements on the reunion.

376
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,380
Oh, I did receive a catch phone, though.

377
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,880
No one answered when I picked it up, and the person hung up right away.

378
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,780
Officer Takagi, will you verify this right away?

379
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,880
Yes, sir.

380
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,580
I was looking for a flashlight when it backed out

381
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,480
and handed it over to Hikaru.

382
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,380
I was here in the kitchen right through.

383
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,480
Can someone verify that for you?

384
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,580
No, not really.

385
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,480
Tomoaki was here all the while.

386
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,580
After Hikaru went to raise the breaker, I was scared,

387
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,580
so I was clinging on to Tomoaki until the lights went on.

388
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,680
Are you sure?

389
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,180
Why?

390
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,580
So like I said, I thought he was my dad.

391
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,180
Next, Mitsu, where were you?

392
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:23,980
I had just finished climbing the stairs when the lights went out.

393
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,380
And, I fingered my way to my room upstairs.

394
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,780
But, I hear that when the lights went back on,

395
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:33,780
you were downstairs near the kitchen.

396
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,980
I felt a presence.

397
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,580
Just as I was about to hit the sack,

398
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,680
I felt a presence outside my room.

399
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,180
Don't tell me that

400
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,180
someone else other than all of you had snuck into the house?

401
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:49,980
I felt that way and followed the sound downstairs.

402
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,980
But, I found out.

403
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,380
What did you find out?

404
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,880
It was the sound of the rain.

405
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,680
Oh.

406
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,680
And, finally you, Hikaru.

407
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,880
Yes.

408
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,780
I went over to the breaker to turn on the lights.

409
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:10,380
I'm still not used to this house, so I got lost a bit, though.

410
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,780
You didn't notice anyone suspicious, did you?

411
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,680
No, nobody.

412
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,180
Just as I thought.

413
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,880
Gosh.

414
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,580
I noticed you were holding your arm.

415
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,980
You're always much too tolerant from before.

416
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,580
A burn?

417
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,980
Excuse me, but I'd like to treat her wound,

418
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,280
so would it be all right to go to the clinic?

419
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,080
Yes, but please have the officer in the corridor accompany you.

420
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,680
We're under surveillance, eh?

421
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,580
Oh, and one more thing.

422
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:49,280
You seem to be the only one who had left the house

423
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,380
between 5:00 and 7:00, where to?

424
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,380
I went as temporary basket ball coach for a high school club.

425
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,080
It's my alma mater,

426
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,780
and since my mentor broke his bone,

427
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,380
I'm substituting for him until he recovers.

428
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,580
You, a doctor, a basketball coach?

429
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,180
You can go ahead and ask Ran about it.

430
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:14,880
I go to coach for Teitan High School, the school that Ran goes to.

431
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:19,180
You know the advisor of the basketball club Mr. Tabuchi, don't you?

432
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,980
Oh, yes.

433
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,580
Hey... don't tell me that

434
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,480
the karate club that Ran was going to daily is...

435
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,080
It can't be?

436
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,780
It can't be?

437
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,480
Just as I thought.

438
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,280
Will you please go check the breaker?

439
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,980
Okay.

440
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,880
I wonder why the lights went out.

441
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,180
Come to think of it, that man

442
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,280
was saying something about experimenting while taking a bath.

443
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,580
Don't tell me that dad...

444
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,980
You're the killer, aren't you?

445
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,880
Next Conan,

446
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,000
"Blind Spot in the Darkness (Part 2)"

447
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,400
Next Conan's Hint:

448
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,000
"Burn injury"

449
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,700
-Next episode... -Ran's heart is changing.

450
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,000
Shinichi's in a fix.
