1
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:06,639
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:08,539
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:10,039
The stage for today's episode is a TV station.

4
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:11,439
The passion for creating a program

5
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:13,639
gets bent out of shape along the way and leads to murder!

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,139
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:16,939
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:19,339
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:00,306 --> 00:02:03,706
And you want me, Kogoro Mouri...

10
00:02:05,006 --> 00:02:07,606
to speak before the scriptwriters?

11
00:02:07,606 --> 00:02:12,006
Yes. I'd really like you to tell them your story, Detective Mouri.

12
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,806
Have you ever seen the show "Detective Fluke"?

13
00:02:14,806 --> 00:02:18,706
Well, since it's a detective story, I've watched it several times.

14
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:20,806
I watch it every week!

15
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:22,506
Thank you.

16
00:02:22,506 --> 00:02:27,706
Three people are taking turns writing the scripts of "Detective Fluke".

17
00:02:27,706 --> 00:02:31,106
However, since we've been doing this for five years now,

18
00:02:31,106 --> 00:02:34,106
we're running out of things and tricks to write about.

19
00:02:34,106 --> 00:02:40,106
So you want to use my experiences as a reference to make your scripts.

20
00:02:40,106 --> 00:02:44,106
It doesn't happen all the time,

21
00:02:44,106 --> 00:02:47,106
but once in several times, there are fantastic ones.

22
00:02:47,106 --> 00:02:48,306
For example,

23
00:02:48,306 --> 00:02:52,806
"52nd Closed Door Murder" had a surprising trick.

24
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:55,606
If so, Fluke, that locked room was...

25
00:02:57,006 --> 00:03:00,206
It was set up afterwards, Inspector.

26
00:03:00,206 --> 00:03:03,506
The entire house was lifted up with a crane.

27
00:03:07,306 --> 00:03:11,006
No one would ever think that such a large scale method would be used.

28
00:03:11,006 --> 00:03:16,006
But you can't fool the eyes of Detective Rintaro Fluke here.

29
00:03:21,306 --> 00:03:24,006
It's amazing how they can think up a trick like that.

30
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:26,806
It makes me so happy.

31
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:32,506
I think that the "52nd Closed Door Murder" is a great mystery story, too.

32
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:35,106
But it was broadcast more than 2 years ago.

33
00:03:35,106 --> 00:03:37,506
How old are you now anyway, Conan?

34
00:03:37,506 --> 00:03:40,006
Well...

35
00:03:40,006 --> 00:03:42,306
I saw it on a video the other day.

36
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,806
Oh, my. Of course.

37
00:03:47,406 --> 00:03:49,106
That was close.

38
00:03:49,106 --> 00:03:50,506
I understand.

39
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:54,506
I'll tell the scriptwriters all the various experiences I've been through.

40
00:03:55,806 --> 00:03:57,606
May I go, too?

41
00:03:57,606 --> 00:04:01,206
I'd like to meet the people who are writing "Detective Fluke"!

42
00:04:04,106 --> 00:04:09,906
"The Mystery of the Complete Half Crime"

43
00:04:17,706 --> 00:04:20,106
Maybe we came here too early.

44
00:04:20,106 --> 00:04:22,406
There's an hour more before the appointed time.

45
00:04:22,406 --> 00:04:25,706
I'm sure there was a coffee shop on the top floor.

46
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:27,506
I'm scriptwriter, Yagami.

47
00:04:27,506 --> 00:04:30,506
I'm going to the producer of "Detective Fluke", Inoue's place.

48
00:04:30,506 --> 00:04:32,606
Yes, sir. One moment, please.

49
00:04:34,006 --> 00:04:38,506
That guy. He's one of the three scriptwriters, isn't he?

50
00:04:38,506 --> 00:04:42,206
He seems somewhat unfriendly and arrogant.

51
00:04:45,006 --> 00:04:48,106
Mr. Yagami, long time no see.

52
00:04:48,106 --> 00:04:52,806
Well, the cab I was riding got caught in traffic.

53
00:04:57,306 --> 00:04:59,006
I think it's been six months already

54
00:04:59,006 --> 00:05:00,706
that we've all gotten together like this.

55
00:05:00,706 --> 00:05:03,606
While we're waiting for Mr. Mouri to arrive a while later,

56
00:05:03,606 --> 00:05:05,706
I would like to conduct a meeting

57
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:08,006
as to the development of this series from now on.

58
00:05:08,006 --> 00:05:10,306
I'd like something to drink.

59
00:05:10,306 --> 00:05:11,406
What about all of you?

60
00:05:11,406 --> 00:05:13,106
No, thank you.

61
00:05:13,106 --> 00:05:15,706
I'll go get it. I'll take your order.

62
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:19,606
Coffee! Hot.

63
00:05:19,606 --> 00:05:22,006
-Same here. -Same here.

64
00:05:22,006 --> 00:05:23,406
Okay, I'll be right back.

65
00:05:28,906 --> 00:05:32,306
I'm sorry. Let me do it.

66
00:05:32,306 --> 00:05:34,806
It's okay, I'm always doing this.

67
00:05:35,806 --> 00:05:37,906
Is he a waiter or what?

68
00:05:37,906 --> 00:05:41,306
I think the meeting is more important.

69
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:44,306
Is he really a scriptwriter, or what?

70
00:05:44,306 --> 00:05:46,906
He writes great stuff.

71
00:05:46,906 --> 00:05:48,606
I'm not talking about what he writes.

72
00:05:48,606 --> 00:05:52,006
I'm talking about the way he usually behaves, Sakuma.

73
00:05:52,006 --> 00:05:54,206
He's still a newcomer, so...

74
00:05:54,206 --> 00:05:56,806
I'm sure he's trying to be as considerate as possible!

75
00:05:56,806 --> 00:05:59,906
I think you should take him off the list after all, Ms. Inoue.

76
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:04,206
Sakuma and I can probably handle "Detective Fluke" ourselves.

77
00:06:04,206 --> 00:06:06,106
-Mr. Yagami... -Mr. Yagami...

78
00:06:07,606 --> 00:06:09,006
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

79
00:06:10,906 --> 00:06:12,906
Thank you.

80
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:16,406
If I remember correctly, you use milk, don't you?

81
00:06:16,406 --> 00:06:19,206
I forgot the milk. I'll be right back.

82
00:06:23,606 --> 00:06:27,406
I tell you, he lacks composure.

83
00:06:29,706 --> 00:06:32,606
He still very young.

84
00:06:51,006 --> 00:06:52,506
-Mr. Yagami! -Mr. Yagami!

85
00:06:58,206 --> 00:07:01,106
Yes, Ms. Inoue.

86
00:07:02,906 --> 00:07:04,606
What did you just say?

87
00:07:09,106 --> 00:07:10,406
Yes!

88
00:07:10,406 --> 00:07:13,206
That's right. The address here is...

89
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:23,006
Mr. Mouri.

90
00:07:23,006 --> 00:07:27,506
The smell of almond, it's poisoning by cyanic acid.

91
00:07:36,606 --> 00:07:40,206
Four people and four drinks.

92
00:07:51,006 --> 00:07:55,006
There was poison in the coffee cup that was on the floor.

93
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:58,806
No poison whatsoever was detected in the other three cups.

94
00:07:58,806 --> 00:08:02,806
In other words, the culprit put poison only in Mr. Yagami's cup.

95
00:08:02,806 --> 00:08:04,106
That's right.

96
00:08:04,106 --> 00:08:07,706
Mr. Koda, you're the one who got the drinks?

97
00:08:07,706 --> 00:08:08,906
Yes, sir.

98
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,606
I took everyone's order.

99
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:14,106
Everyone usually drinks hot coffee while I drink Japanese tea.

100
00:08:15,406 --> 00:08:19,806
But doesn't a staff of the TV station usually the who serves tea?

101
00:08:19,806 --> 00:08:22,406
Yes, but...

102
00:08:22,406 --> 00:08:26,006
I'm still a fledgling scriptwriter,

103
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:29,206
so I try to help out whenever I can.

104
00:08:29,206 --> 00:08:30,706
Is something strange about what I did?

105
00:08:30,706 --> 00:08:33,606
No, not really.

106
00:08:33,606 --> 00:08:34,906
I see!

107
00:08:34,906 --> 00:08:38,506
One of the cups in the hot water room was smeared with poison

108
00:08:38,506 --> 00:08:40,706
and that cup just happened to go to Mr. Yagami.

109
00:08:42,306 --> 00:08:45,906
So, you're saying that someone wanted to commit at random murder?

110
00:08:45,906 --> 00:08:48,206
I can't think of anything else.

111
00:08:51,806 --> 00:08:54,206
So you said that you'd serve the coffee,

112
00:08:54,206 --> 00:08:56,006
but Mr. Koda insisted on doing it himself.

113
00:08:56,006 --> 00:08:58,306
Yes, he said he'd do it himself.

114
00:09:01,406 --> 00:09:03,006
May I have a moment with you, Inspector?

115
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:09,806
Ms. Inoue, will you please come with me?

116
00:09:09,806 --> 00:09:10,806
Yes, sir.

117
00:09:14,206 --> 00:09:15,506
Judging from the circumstances,

118
00:09:15,506 --> 00:09:17,406
the only one who would've been able to mix the poison in the drink

119
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:19,306
is Mr. Koda.

120
00:09:19,306 --> 00:09:24,106
His remark of it being a random killing is shaky justification

121
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,606
and we feel that he's our man.

122
00:09:26,606 --> 00:09:29,006
But what's his motive?

123
00:09:29,006 --> 00:09:31,506
You brat! I told you to stay in your room.

124
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:35,606
He's writing for the same program, isn't he?

125
00:09:35,606 --> 00:09:37,806
Why would he want to poison his colleague?

126
00:09:37,806 --> 00:09:40,106
He may be a colleague, but...

127
00:09:40,106 --> 00:09:42,706
Is something bothering you?

128
00:09:42,706 --> 00:09:44,106
Please tell us about it.

129
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:46,206
This is a homicide case, you know.

130
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,106
The scripts of "Detective Fluke"

131
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:56,506
were originally being written by both Mr. Yagaimi and Mr. Sakuma by turns.

132
00:09:56,506 --> 00:09:59,406
Then, this man who introduced himself as a fervent fan of the program

133
00:09:59,406 --> 00:10:01,506
brings a plot that he had written to me.

134
00:10:01,506 --> 00:10:03,506
He was Mr. Koda.

135
00:10:03,506 --> 00:10:06,106
I read it, and found it to be very interesting.

136
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:09,906
So I decided to have him work for us as our third scriptwriter.

137
00:10:09,906 --> 00:10:12,906
Although Mr. Sakuma evaluated him highly,

138
00:10:12,906 --> 00:10:15,506
Mr. Yagami for some reason didn't like him.

139
00:10:16,806 --> 00:10:22,306
Therefore, Mr. Yagami had repeatedly told me to take him off the program.

140
00:10:22,306 --> 00:10:25,006
Did Mr. Koda know about this?

141
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:27,606
I think he could sense it from the atmosphere.

142
00:10:27,606 --> 00:10:29,806
I'm sure it was a very trying situation for Mr. Koda.

143
00:10:29,806 --> 00:10:31,306
Which means...

144
00:10:32,306 --> 00:10:33,706
Ms. Inoue.

145
00:10:33,706 --> 00:10:37,106
I want to write as many scripts of this popular program as I can,

146
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:40,706
sell my name and make a name for myself as a successful scriptwriter!

147
00:10:42,906 --> 00:10:47,906
Mr. Koda was staking his future on "Detective Fluke".

148
00:10:47,906 --> 00:10:52,606
But Mr. Yagami wanted to get Mr. Koda off the project no matter what.

149
00:10:52,606 --> 00:10:55,406
Inspector, there's no doubt that he...

150
00:10:58,106 --> 00:11:00,606
He does have a motive.

151
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,006
But if he did do it...

152
00:11:21,206 --> 00:11:23,906
Hey, Mr. Mouri. Wait!

153
00:11:23,906 --> 00:11:26,206
We already know who the killer is!

154
00:11:26,206 --> 00:11:29,106
But we don't have any material evidence whatsoever yet.

155
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:31,706
Besides, there are things that are not solved yet.

156
00:11:31,706 --> 00:11:34,106
Shut up! I'll make him spit it out.

157
00:11:34,106 --> 00:11:37,306
I'm the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri!

158
00:11:37,306 --> 00:11:38,706
Are you sure?

159
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:42,406
I killed Mr. Yagami?

160
00:11:42,406 --> 00:11:44,506
You're suspecting that I did it?

161
00:11:44,506 --> 00:11:45,906
No way.

162
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:50,506
Well, it's true that I slightly hated him, but...

163
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:55,006
Mr. Mouri, even if I were to have put poison into the coffee cup,

164
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,606
I wouldn't make Mr. Yagami drink it.

165
00:11:57,606 --> 00:12:00,906
Because out of the three cups, only one would be poisoned.

166
00:12:00,906 --> 00:12:04,806
Moreover, I left to go get milk, so I wasn't there.

167
00:12:05,806 --> 00:12:07,806
In other words, I didn't urge him to drink it,

168
00:12:07,806 --> 00:12:10,106
but Mr. Yagami drank it of his own initiative.

169
00:12:10,106 --> 00:12:12,906
There was no way I could've known

170
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:15,506
that Mr. Yagami would choose the coffee cup he chose.

171
00:12:15,506 --> 00:12:16,706
Am I wrong?

172
00:12:16,706 --> 00:12:18,806
Well...

173
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:20,506
That's it.

174
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,706
If he's the killer,

175
00:12:22,706 --> 00:12:26,406
how did he make Mr. Yagami choose the cup he drank out of?

176
00:12:29,506 --> 00:12:31,106
I see!

177
00:12:32,206 --> 00:12:33,306
Mr. Mouri?

178
00:12:34,406 --> 00:12:36,106
You brought the drinks

179
00:12:36,106 --> 00:12:40,006
and gave the cup without the poison inside to Ms. Inoue,

180
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:42,206
which leaves two cups remaining.

181
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:44,106
Two cups would be the same as I mentioned earlier.

182
00:12:44,106 --> 00:12:46,406
I'd have no idea which one Mr. Yagami would choose.

183
00:12:46,406 --> 00:12:50,406
That's easy. All you have to do is line it up this way.

184
00:12:50,406 --> 00:12:55,506
Mr. Yagami was sitting just about here in the room back then.

185
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:58,006
He would most naturally take the cup that is nearest to him.

186
00:12:58,006 --> 00:13:01,006
Moreover, Mr. Sakuma would never pick up his coffee cup

187
00:13:01,006 --> 00:13:03,206
before Mr. Yagami, his superior.

188
00:13:03,206 --> 00:13:04,906
I see.

189
00:13:04,906 --> 00:13:07,106
I wonder about that.

190
00:13:07,106 --> 00:13:09,506
No, although he is my superior and I came in after him,

191
00:13:09,506 --> 00:13:11,906
we know each other quite well.

192
00:13:11,906 --> 00:13:14,806
So even back then I took the coffee cup before Mr. Yagami

193
00:13:14,806 --> 00:13:17,506
and gave him the remaining cup.

194
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:21,506
If that's the case, doesn't that make me suspicious?

195
00:13:23,506 --> 00:13:27,106
Mr. Mouri, if you want to implicate me so much,

196
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,006
just what kind of trick did I use

197
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:32,806
to make sure Mr. Yagami drank the poison?

198
00:13:32,806 --> 00:13:35,706
Figure that out first.

199
00:13:35,706 --> 00:13:38,306
Those challenging eyes...

200
00:13:38,306 --> 00:13:40,906
He's gotta be the suspect.

201
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:44,506
And he's confident about the trick he used.

202
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:48,306
Two people and two drinks.

203
00:13:48,306 --> 00:13:52,206
The percentage of each choice is 50%.

204
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:56,106
Just what kind of trick he use to get a probability of 100%?

205
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:08,050
Mr. Mouri. To be honest, I have my doubts about suspecting Mr. Koda.

206
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,750
If by chance Mr. Sakuma had chosen the poisoned coffee

207
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,850
instead of Mr. Yagami who it was intended for,

208
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,850
he would've had to stop him from drinking it no matter what.

209
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:21,650
But he left the room saying that he forgot the milk.

210
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,050
If he were the killer, would he leave the scene?

211
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,450
That's true.

212
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,950
Didn't it cross his mind that an accident could occur?

213
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,450
Hey.

214
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,250
Are you listening to me, Mr. Mouri?

215
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,550
I wonder what's going to happen to "Detective Fluke" from now on.

216
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,850
Is it going to end?

217
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,750
I don't know. But with something like this happening...

218
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,850
After all the effort that was put into writing the scripts.

219
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,150
Is that the list for "Detective Fluke"?

220
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,750
May I have a look at it?

221
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,550
Go ahead.

222
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,550
Thank you.

223
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,150
What is it?

224
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,550
That was Mr. Koda's script, wasn't it?

225
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,950
The one entitled "52nd Closed Room Murder".

226
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:19,150
The one you said that you thought was interesting, too.

227
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:24,550
Actually, that was the first plot that Mr. Koda brought here.

228
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:29,250
I was also surprised that a new scriptwriter with such talent existed.

229
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,750
Mr. Koda also wrote the "Supporting Performers Club"?

230
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,850
Yes. Why?

231
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,950
Don't tell me that...

232
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,950
Most of the scripts are written by both Mr. Yagami and Mr. Sakuma.

233
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,350
They're after all the main scriptwriters, so...

234
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,450
In other words, no matter how talented he is,

235
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,650
he doesn't have the chance to display it.

236
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,450
And if that's the motive,

237
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,550
every mystery is solved.

238
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,150
What's the matter, Conan?

239
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,050
Ms. Inoue!

240
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,150
I've finally arrived at the goal.

241
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,350
It seems that he's figured out the trick!

242
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,450
No way.

243
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:11,750
There are two people and two drinks.

244
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:17,050
The way to make the target drink the poison for sure is...

245
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,650
No matter how much I think, there's only one way.

246
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,650
That is...

247
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,950
to believe in luck.

248
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:35,350
Mr. Mouri, is that the conclusion you've reached?

249
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,250
Inspector, this is no joke.

250
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,250
The rate of success is 50%.

251
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,350
You took a sink or swim chance.

252
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,450
Mr. Koda, your desperate feeling

253
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,850
of not wanting to be removed from the script writing of "Detective Fluke"

254
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,650
made you take the dreadful risk of sink or swim.

255
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,050
That's enough, Mr. Mouri.

256
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:58,450
No, Inspector! I'm saying this with conviction.

257
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,450
Mr. Mouri?

258
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,550
Could this be the rumoured...

259
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,950
Sleeping Kogoro?

260
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,450
I took a sink or swim chance?

261
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,750
Are you serious about what you're saying?

262
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,550
At one point I really thought so, but...

263
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,550
Mr. Mouri...

264
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,150
Please hear me out, Inspector.

265
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:29,350
Mr. Koda, you said to solve the mystery of the trick you used

266
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,150
to make Mr. Yagami choose the poisoned coffee

267
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,150
if we're going to suspect you.

268
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,550
But that's impossible.

269
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:40,550
Because you used no trick to begin with.

270
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,150
There's no trick?

271
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,050
No, nothing at all.

272
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:48,450
If so, how did he make Mr. Yagami drink the poisoned coffee?

273
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,650
Before I tell you that,

274
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,950
please let me explain how I came to such a conclusion.

275
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,850
Conan, bring me the stuff.

276
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,050
Okay.

277
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,850
This is the list of the scripts of "Detective Fluke"

278
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,150
that Conan just borrowed.

279
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,650
I was surprised at seeing this.

280
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:15,750
One among several scripts is an extremely well written mystery story.

281
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,850
Ingenious tricks, logical mystery solving,

282
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:22,850
and most of all, a story development that sticks to unbiased standards.

283
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:26,550
For example, "52nd Closed Door Murder" is one of them.

284
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,450
So is "Supporting Performers Club",

285
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,350
"Evil Well Murder",

286
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,750
and "When the Door of Fate Opens."

287
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,550
Those scripts are all...

288
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:39,750
Yes, all those scripts that I thought to be amazing

289
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,250
were those that you have written, Mr. Koda.

290
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,050
When I found out,

291
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,650
that's when I changed my mind.

292
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,750
A person such as you who writes such a perfect mystery story

293
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:00,450
would never take a sink or swim chance when the success rate is 50%.

294
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,450
And I began to question your motive.

295
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:09,050
That is, why did you leave the place back then?

296
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:13,850
You had it in mind beforehand that you would say that you forgot the milk.

297
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,450
You may have wanted to instil the impression on everyone

298
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,850
that you had nothing to do with which cup of coffee

299
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,950
Mr. Yagami and Mr. Sakuma were going to choose.

300
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,950
But that action of yours is suspiciously strange after all.

301
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,650
Because as Inspector Megure had mentioned earlier,

302
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,650
if by chance Mr. Sakuma had chosen the poisoned coffee

303
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,550
instead of Mr. Yagami who it was intended for,

304
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,650
he would've had to stop him from drinking it no matter what.

305
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,750
That's right. No matter how good your plan is,

306
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,150
it can always go wrong.

307
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:48,650
You, who writes flawless mysteries would not overlook that fact.

308
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,450
Nevertheless, you left the meeting room.

309
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:56,450
There is only one possible answer.

310
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,450
You did not only target Mr. Yagami.

311
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,850
Mr. Mouri.

312
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,850
Just what are you trying to get at, Mr. Mouri?

313
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:11,150
It didn't matter whether Mr. Yagami or Mr. Sakuma drank it.

314
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,550
That's why no trick needed to be used.

315
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:20,650
In other words, you're saying that he didn't care which of us he killed?

316
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,750
You mean it was such a flimsy murder plan?

317
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,850
This is no flimsy plan, Inspector.

318
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,550
No matter who dies, the result he wants is achieved.

319
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:33,550
So long as one of the two main scriptwriters disappears,

320
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,050
the chance of the third scriptwriter,

321
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:39,150
Mr. Koda getting to introduce his writings would increase tremendously.

322
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,650
He wanted to write as many scripts of "Detective Fluke" as he could.

323
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:46,150
This is probably the real motive for the murder that was committed.

324
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,550
Is it not, Mr. Koda?

325
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,450
Ms. Inoue.

326
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:56,950
I want to write as many scripts of this popular program as I can,

327
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:02,050
sell my name and make a name for myself as a successful scriptwriter!

328
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,450
Mr. Koda...

329
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:11,950
At first glance, it looked to be a plan with only 50% chance of succeeding.

330
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,650
But if it didn't matter which of the two drank the poisoned coffee,

331
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,550
the rate of success would be 100%.

332
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,850
I see.

333
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,750
I'm already 29, you see.

334
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,550
By age 30, I'll be a writer in great demand.

335
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:38,750
That's my goal as a scriptwriter.

336
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,150
What's this thing about being a writer in demand?

337
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,850
Even if you write only one in ten scripts,

338
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,250
those who read your scripts can all tell how talented you are.

339
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,150
Even Ms. Inoue evaluated your scripts highly.

340
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,150
I remember all your scripts, too.

341
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:03,050
They were all very good.

342
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,550
You're so stupid.

343
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,050
So "Detective Fluke" is going to end after all?

344
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:45,750
"Detective Fluke" ends, and a new series of "Detective Fluke" will begin!

345
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,550
It says that the name of the main character's going to be changed

346
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,550
from "Rintaro Fluke" to "Kogoro Fluke".

347
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,150
Kogoro Fluke.

348
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:56,750
It sounds like Kogoro's a fluke!

349
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,850
