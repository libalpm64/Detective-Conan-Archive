1
00:00:23,267 --> 00:00:24,967
Today, we're all going out to look at the stars.

2
00:00:24,967 --> 00:00:26,467
We go out looking for a comet and discover a skeleton instead.

3
00:00:26,467 --> 00:00:28,167
Solve the mystery of the scattered cigarettes!

4
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:29,667
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:31,267
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:33,067
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,818
Abnormality observation?

8
00:01:59,818 --> 00:02:02,018
No, Genta.

9
00:02:02,018 --> 00:02:05,518
Astronomical observation, astronomical observation.

10
00:02:05,518 --> 00:02:09,418
Dr. Agasa, are we going to go watch stars from now?

11
00:02:09,418 --> 00:02:14,218
Yeah, I found a nice pension in the mountains of Gunma.

12
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,618
But why are you going outside to watch stars

13
00:02:16,618 --> 00:02:18,818
at a cold time like this?

14
00:02:18,818 --> 00:02:21,118
It's good because it's cold.

15
00:02:21,118 --> 00:02:22,918
The colder it is, the cleaner the air,

16
00:02:22,918 --> 00:02:24,718
and the better it is to watch the stars.

17
00:02:24,718 --> 00:02:26,818
Beside, tonight is the new moon.

18
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:28,018
In other words,

19
00:02:28,018 --> 00:02:30,218
it's just the night to carry out an astronomical observation.

20
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:35,518
But, isn't it going to be boring just looking at the stars?

21
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:37,518
Come on, don't say that.

22
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:39,518
You can study the stars,

23
00:02:39,518 --> 00:02:42,718
and we may by chance discover a new stars.

24
00:02:42,718 --> 00:02:45,318
If we do, it may be named after us.

25
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:48,418
-What? Our names! -What? Our names!

26
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,718
A star...

27
00:02:49,718 --> 00:02:51,918
We can name it after ourselves?

28
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:53,118
Yes, right.

29
00:02:54,118 --> 00:02:56,418
Of course that's impossible

30
00:02:56,418 --> 00:02:57,718
when it comes to asteroids in

31
00:02:57,718 --> 00:02:59,518
which the orbit has to be observed repeatedly

32
00:02:59,518 --> 00:03:01,318
and verified though.

33
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:03,118
But there is a possibility

34
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:05,118
if the star is a comet that only requires to be found.

35
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:09,118
How about calling it Beika Youth Detective Squad Comet?

36
00:03:09,118 --> 00:03:10,218
Sounds nice.

37
00:03:10,218 --> 00:03:12,918
-Nice, isn't it? -Nope.

38
00:03:12,918 --> 00:03:16,818
The only star you can give a name of your choice to is to asteroids.

39
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:19,418
Comets are named after the surnames of their discoverers,

40
00:03:19,418 --> 00:03:21,418
and moreover, the surnames of only the three people

41
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:23,518
who submitted their names the earliest can be given to the star.

42
00:03:23,518 --> 00:03:27,518
Right, if a comet is found at the same time all over the world,

43
00:03:27,518 --> 00:03:30,818
it's possible that your name will be mixed with a foreign name.

44
00:03:30,818 --> 00:03:34,818
Three people, me, and...

45
00:03:34,818 --> 00:03:38,818
For example, Kobayashi, Burger, Millon.

46
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,718
So, if we find a comet

47
00:03:40,718 --> 00:03:42,718
and apply for it quickly,

48
00:03:42,718 --> 00:03:47,418
it could be Yoshida Tsuburaya Haibara comet, right?

49
00:03:47,418 --> 00:03:48,818
Yeah, right?

50
00:03:48,818 --> 00:03:50,718
Yes, well...

51
00:03:50,718 --> 00:03:54,818
Yoshida, Tsuburaya, Haibara?

52
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:57,318
How come my name's not there?

53
00:03:57,318 --> 00:03:59,418
Include Conan's name too.

54
00:03:59,418 --> 00:04:03,418
But it's only up to three names.

55
00:04:03,418 --> 00:04:05,418
Conan, don't you?

56
00:04:05,418 --> 00:04:08,018
Just what are you doing, Conan?

57
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:11,018
That man. He's the sports reporter, Masaharu Motoyama,

58
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:13,418
the one that killed the professional baseball player Mr. Nose,

59
00:04:13,418 --> 00:04:16,318
last time in Okinawa, right?

60
00:04:16,318 --> 00:04:19,318
You were there at the time of the incident too, weren't you, Conan?

61
00:04:19,318 --> 00:04:22,218
Yeah. I was bothered about something so...

62
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:23,218
"Sports reporter, Masaharu Motoyama"

63
00:04:23,218 --> 00:04:25,018
Bothered about what?

64
00:04:25,018 --> 00:04:27,618
Well, it's not such a big deal but...

65
00:04:27,618 --> 00:04:30,618
I was just wondering who he would call on his cell phone

66
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:33,818
during an interrogation session.

67
00:04:33,818 --> 00:04:36,018
The police already would've contacted

68
00:04:36,018 --> 00:04:40,318
the late Mr. Nose's parents and family so...

69
00:04:40,318 --> 00:04:43,418
I think it's Mr. Motoyama's personal acquaintance.

70
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:48,118
Darn! I should've directly asked him who he called.

71
00:04:48,118 --> 00:04:50,018
Maybe...

72
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:52,018
it was baseball player Kobayashi?

73
00:04:52,018 --> 00:04:56,318
The one who entered the team at the same time as Mr. Motoyama.

74
00:04:56,318 --> 00:05:00,318
They were on an off-season travel program together, all three of them,

75
00:05:00,318 --> 00:05:02,218
and seemed to get along well together.

76
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:06,118
There's a possibility he informed him of the death of his best friend.

77
00:05:06,118 --> 00:05:09,218
He seems to have succeeded his parents' Japanese inn

78
00:05:09,218 --> 00:05:10,818
after he retired four years ago.

79
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:15,018
If I remember correctly, it was in a place called Kurayoshi in Tottori.

80
00:05:15,018 --> 00:05:17,718
I saw it when it was introduced on TV once,

81
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:20,118
but it looked to be a nice inn.

82
00:05:20,118 --> 00:05:21,618
I see.

83
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:26,518
It seems to have nothing to do with the men in black.

84
00:05:30,218 --> 00:05:32,118
Kurayoshi.

85
00:05:32,118 --> 00:05:34,718
Shinichi, don't tell me that you're...

86
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:47,018
"Stars, a Cigarette and a Code (Part 1)"

87
00:05:47,718 --> 00:05:50,318
Mr. Agasa, right? We've been waiting for you.

88
00:05:50,318 --> 00:05:52,418
Please sign your name on our guest list.

89
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,218
All right.

90
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:56,118
Hiroshi Agasa.

91
00:05:56,118 --> 00:05:57,818
Where is he?

92
00:05:57,818 --> 00:05:58,918
"Etsuko Nonomiya (28), Guest"

93
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:02,218
He told you to come here too, didn't he?

94
00:06:03,218 --> 00:06:05,118
Please tell me.

95
00:06:05,118 --> 00:06:07,118
I want to apologize to him.

96
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:09,218
Where is Asao?

97
00:06:09,218 --> 00:06:10,618
Asao, who is he?

98
00:06:10,618 --> 00:06:11,918
Don't play dumb with me!

99
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:14,018
A man wearing the same ring that's a pair with this one!

100
00:06:14,018 --> 00:06:15,418
Asao Kono!

101
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:18,718
You got an invitation card from him to, didn't you?

102
00:06:18,718 --> 00:06:20,718
Ms. Nonomiya.

103
00:06:20,718 --> 00:06:22,218
Invitation card?

104
00:06:22,218 --> 00:06:27,218
Oh, no, you see, this is our first visit here.

105
00:06:27,218 --> 00:06:29,418
Oh, really?

106
00:06:29,418 --> 00:06:30,818
I'm sorry

107
00:06:32,718 --> 00:06:34,318
Was that a surprise...

108
00:06:34,318 --> 00:06:36,418
I'm so sorry.

109
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:38,018
Who is she?

110
00:06:38,018 --> 00:06:39,918
"Amatsuchi (34), Pension Owner" -Her name is Etsuko Nonomiya

111
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,118
and she's an under classman of the university that I went to.

112
00:06:43,118 --> 00:06:44,418
The man, Kono that she was referring to

113
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:46,318
was also an underclassman of my university.

114
00:06:46,318 --> 00:06:48,318
They were engaged.

115
00:06:48,318 --> 00:06:52,118
They used to come and stay over here a lot together in the past,

116
00:06:52,118 --> 00:06:55,318
but after they had a big fight here a year ago,

117
00:06:55,318 --> 00:06:58,318
he stopped coming all together.

118
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:00,318
Then last week, she seems to have received

119
00:07:00,318 --> 00:07:03,818
an invitation card asking her to come here

120
00:07:03,818 --> 00:07:06,418
and she's been waiting here for the past three days.

121
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:09,018
Since he hasn't shown up at all,

122
00:07:09,018 --> 00:07:11,318
she's been that way drinking from day time.

123
00:07:11,318 --> 00:07:14,718
But, why would she think that I, who she hasn't even met before

124
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:17,318
would also get an invitation card?

125
00:07:17,318 --> 00:07:19,418
It's only natural.

126
00:07:19,418 --> 00:07:22,418
"Mikami, Futagawa" -Because we who don't even know him all that well,

127
00:07:22,418 --> 00:07:26,618
got an invitation card from that guy called Kono.

128
00:07:26,618 --> 00:07:31,718
Well, we met him once over here a year ago that day.

129
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:34,218
Being that the subject in the invitation card was what it is,

130
00:07:34,218 --> 00:07:35,718
we decided to at least come here.

131
00:07:35,718 --> 00:07:39,218
May I see the invitation card?

132
00:07:39,218 --> 00:07:41,218
Yeah, here.

133
00:07:41,218 --> 00:07:42,418
Thank you.

134
00:07:45,618 --> 00:07:47,618
As a result of my one year observation,

135
00:07:47,618 --> 00:07:51,218
I have come up with a discovery that would shake the basis of astronomy.

136
00:07:51,218 --> 00:07:53,418
I would like your opinion on the matter,

137
00:07:53,418 --> 00:07:55,918
so please come to Pension Amatsuchi.

138
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:58,818
Of course I will foot the room charges.

139
00:07:58,818 --> 00:08:00,418
If you can't come, it can't be helped,

140
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:05,018
but please make an effort to be there, Asao Kono.

141
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,618
Well, judging from the fact that he's not here,

142
00:08:07,618 --> 00:08:11,118
despite two days already gone by it seems to have been a prank.

143
00:08:11,118 --> 00:08:14,118
Shall we head back then, editor?

144
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,718
Editor?

145
00:08:15,718 --> 00:08:20,118
Yeah, we're writing an astronomical magazine called "Space Sunday".

146
00:08:20,118 --> 00:08:23,518
And, Mr. Mikami here is the editor.

147
00:08:25,318 --> 00:08:27,418
He's no ordinary editor, either.

148
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:28,618
Oh, come on.

149
00:08:28,618 --> 00:08:30,218
No big deal.

150
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:34,818
What do you mean by his no ordinary editor?

151
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:37,918
Well, he discovered a new comet,

152
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,718
and is a great man who a star is named after.

153
00:08:41,718 --> 00:08:43,018
-You... -You discovered one?

154
00:08:43,018 --> 00:08:44,418
Where did you find it?

155
00:08:44,418 --> 00:08:46,118
Tell us where too.

156
00:08:46,118 --> 00:08:48,618
Well, where that's not an easy question.

157
00:08:48,618 --> 00:08:50,818
Over there? Over here?

158
00:08:52,218 --> 00:08:54,818
Then I suggest you climb up the road in back

159
00:08:54,818 --> 00:08:56,118
of the pension to the hill beyond.

160
00:08:58,018 --> 00:09:00,018
It's a scenic viewpoint,

161
00:09:00,018 --> 00:09:02,418
and just great for viewing stars

162
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:05,618
If you want, I'll lend you a telescope too.

163
00:09:05,618 --> 00:09:07,118
For 5000 yen.

164
00:09:08,118 --> 00:09:10,518
You're charging us for it.

165
00:09:10,518 --> 00:09:13,618
-Be careful. -Okay!

166
00:09:13,618 --> 00:09:17,018
All right. We'll find our star for sure!

167
00:09:17,018 --> 00:09:18,318
Aye!

168
00:09:19,618 --> 00:09:21,118
Hopeless amateurs.

169
00:09:21,118 --> 00:09:24,118
Don't they know it's not that easy to find.

170
00:09:24,118 --> 00:09:25,418
Right, editor?

171
00:09:26,418 --> 00:09:29,218
No, who knows.

172
00:09:29,218 --> 00:09:31,018
No matter how knowledgeable you are,

173
00:09:31,018 --> 00:09:34,218
whether you can find a star or not depends on luck.

174
00:09:34,218 --> 00:09:37,618
If you're lucky, you can find one.

175
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,918
Right, editor?

176
00:09:39,918 --> 00:09:42,318
Won't you find him for me with your luck

177
00:09:42,318 --> 00:09:44,418
of having found a star?

178
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,418
The guy who was obsessed by stars

179
00:09:46,418 --> 00:09:49,118
and disappeared into the darkness of space.

180
00:09:49,118 --> 00:09:52,018
My precious partner.

181
00:09:56,618 --> 00:09:58,818
It sure is kind of far.

182
00:09:58,818 --> 00:10:01,218
Come on, Dr. Agasa. Hang in there.

183
00:10:01,218 --> 00:10:02,718
Hurry, hurry.

184
00:10:07,218 --> 00:10:09,418
Isn't that the hill?

185
00:10:10,718 --> 00:10:13,018
It's more a cliff than a hill.

186
00:10:13,018 --> 00:10:16,218
You mean we're going to climb way up there?

187
00:10:16,218 --> 00:10:18,318
Let's take a break.

188
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:21,218
Hey, let's climb up there before sundown.

189
00:10:21,218 --> 00:10:23,618
Treat the aged with kindness.

190
00:10:23,618 --> 00:10:27,818
You're usually telling me not to treat you like the aged.

191
00:10:27,818 --> 00:10:30,018
Shall we rest about ten minutes then?

192
00:10:30,018 --> 00:10:31,518
Agreed!

193
00:10:31,518 --> 00:10:33,918
Darn, come on, man.

194
00:10:40,918 --> 00:10:42,818
A rock, rock...

195
00:10:42,818 --> 00:10:46,018
But, don't you think that invitation was sort of strange?

196
00:10:47,018 --> 00:10:49,818
Would somebody write something like,

197
00:10:49,818 --> 00:10:51,518
"If you can't come, it can't be helped"?

198
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:53,118
True.

199
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:54,818
There must've been some urgent reason

200
00:10:54,818 --> 00:10:57,718
he wanted everyone to come here.

201
00:10:59,818 --> 00:11:00,818
I found one!

202
00:11:10,418 --> 00:11:11,818
What's up, Ayumi?

203
00:11:11,818 --> 00:11:15,018
A skull?

204
00:11:15,018 --> 00:11:16,718
No joke?

205
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,018
Why is a skull in a place like this?

206
00:11:19,018 --> 00:11:21,618
There are some more scattered here.

207
00:11:21,618 --> 00:11:22,818
What?

208
00:11:22,818 --> 00:11:27,118
The lower jaw, the upper forelimb, and the thighbone.

209
00:11:27,118 --> 00:11:28,818
Where's the body itself?

210
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:29,818
Over there?

211
00:11:31,618 --> 00:11:33,618
What on earth?

212
00:11:35,318 --> 00:11:38,418
The person probably fell from that cliff!

213
00:11:38,418 --> 00:11:40,018
Yes, probably.

214
00:11:40,018 --> 00:11:42,318
These are most likely

215
00:11:42,318 --> 00:11:44,518
the bones of someone who fell quite some time ago.

216
00:11:44,518 --> 00:11:47,618
The bones may have scattered due to animals, rain and the wind.

217
00:11:47,618 --> 00:11:48,718
No.

218
00:11:48,718 --> 00:11:50,818
This is a homicide case,

219
00:11:50,818 --> 00:11:52,518
and an extremely heinous one too.

220
00:11:52,518 --> 00:11:53,818
-What? -What?

221
00:11:53,818 --> 00:11:55,918
Look, lime.

222
00:11:55,918 --> 00:11:59,918
Lime has the quality of giving off heat after sucking up liquid.

223
00:11:59,918 --> 00:12:02,418
When lime is scattered around the corpse and the nearby area,

224
00:12:02,418 --> 00:12:05,818
it has the quality of giving off heat after being wet by rain

225
00:12:05,818 --> 00:12:09,218
and as a result, the pace at which the body rots is quickened.

226
00:12:09,218 --> 00:12:12,718
Therefore, the body skeletonizes in a very short time.

227
00:12:12,718 --> 00:12:15,218
Maybe this skeleton is the Mr. Kono

228
00:12:15,218 --> 00:12:18,318
that everybody was talking about back at the inn?

229
00:12:18,318 --> 00:12:22,918
-No way. -But, he sent everybody the invitation card, didn't he?

230
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:26,318
-It could be the man called Kono. -What?

231
00:12:26,318 --> 00:12:29,918
A ring and a cigarette case is under the rock.

232
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:32,118
The letters carved on the ring are,

233
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,918
ETSUKO to ASAO.

234
00:12:34,918 --> 00:12:37,618
It's most likely that Mr. Kono left these here,

235
00:12:37,618 --> 00:12:41,818
before the killer came back down here, after pushing him off the cliff.

236
00:12:41,818 --> 00:12:44,918
He left these here most probably as evidence that he was killed.

237
00:12:44,918 --> 00:12:48,118
But, maybe the killer left them here deliberately.

238
00:12:48,118 --> 00:12:49,518
If so, I think he'd leave it on Mr. Kono's finger

239
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,818
after stripping him naked.

240
00:12:50,818 --> 00:12:54,418
Why would a killer who attempts to hide the identity of his victim

241
00:12:54,418 --> 00:12:57,418
deliberately hide something like that under a rock.

242
00:12:57,418 --> 00:12:59,018
Will somebody lend me a handkerchief?

243
00:12:59,018 --> 00:13:00,718
Okay.

244
00:13:00,718 --> 00:13:02,418
-Yes. -Thank you.

245
00:13:02,418 --> 00:13:05,518
Then, what's this cigarette box?

246
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,718
If my deduction is correct,

247
00:13:07,718 --> 00:13:09,218
this is probably...

248
00:13:14,018 --> 00:13:16,618
All there is in here are cigarettes.

249
00:13:16,618 --> 00:13:19,018
Just as I thought.

250
00:13:19,018 --> 00:13:21,118
Don't tell me that...

251
00:13:21,118 --> 00:13:24,618
Yeah, this is what Mr. Kono left behind.

252
00:13:24,618 --> 00:13:26,218
It's a dying message.

253
00:13:26,218 --> 00:13:28,918
Dying message?

254
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:36,141
What about this cigarette?

255
00:13:36,141 --> 00:13:39,641
Yeah, It's very likely that the man called Asao Kono left clues

256
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:42,941
about who the killer before he was killed.

257
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:48,241
But, isn't it just that two cigarettes out of six are torn?

258
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:50,641
Watch closely.

259
00:13:50,641 --> 00:13:54,441
The two short cigarettes have filters on them, don't they?

260
00:13:54,441 --> 00:13:56,241
It goes to show that the cigarettes were deliberately torn short

261
00:13:56,241 --> 00:13:58,841
and put into the cigarette box.

262
00:13:58,841 --> 00:13:59,941
And besides, look.

263
00:13:59,941 --> 00:14:04,041
If you take a close look under the rock where the cigarette box was hidden,

264
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,641
it's pretty rotted. But the rest of the cigarettes

265
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:09,341
and the cigarettes that were torn apart then are disposed of, right?

266
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:12,041
In other words, Mr. Kono who left this behind

267
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,641
wants us to look at only the four long cigarettes

268
00:14:14,641 --> 00:14:17,941
and two short cigarettes he put into the cigarette box.

269
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,141
We've got to go back and tell the people at the pension about this...

270
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:23,941
Hold it, Dr. Agasa.

271
00:14:23,941 --> 00:14:26,041
It's not a good idea to tell the people of the pension about this.

272
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,141
Call the police first.

273
00:14:27,141 --> 00:14:28,841
What? Why?

274
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:30,841
-Can't you tell? -What?

275
00:14:30,841 --> 00:14:34,541
The guests at the pension right now are all people who have come

276
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,041
because they received invitation cards from Mr. Kono.

277
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,641
If these bones are really Mr. Kono's,

278
00:14:38,641 --> 00:14:42,941
it's obvious that someone else sent them, right?

279
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:47,241
Moreover one year ago when Mr. Kono disappeared from the pension,

280
00:14:47,241 --> 00:14:50,841
the people gathered now were also here back then.

281
00:14:50,841 --> 00:14:52,641
If the reason these bones are scattered

282
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,641
are not because of rain, wind or animals,

283
00:14:55,641 --> 00:14:58,741
but was scattered here deliberately by someone.

284
00:14:58,741 --> 00:15:00,241
Yeah.

285
00:15:00,241 --> 00:15:02,241
The one who sent out the invitation cards is probably hoping

286
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:05,141
that someone would find Mr. Kono's bones

287
00:15:05,141 --> 00:15:08,941
and planning some evil scheme.

288
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,541
What is that evil scheme?

289
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,941
Beats me.

290
00:15:12,941 --> 00:15:14,541
At any rate, call the police.

291
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,941
Hurry and contact them and have them come here.

292
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:18,141
What's up, Dr. Agasa?

293
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:19,741
Oh, well,

294
00:15:19,741 --> 00:15:21,741
it seems that this area is outside the service area

295
00:15:21,741 --> 00:15:24,341
and I can't call.

296
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,941
We've got no choice then,

297
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:27,241
but to go back to the pension

298
00:15:27,241 --> 00:15:30,741
and call the police secretly.

299
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:32,241
The police?

300
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:33,941
What seems to be the matter?

301
00:15:33,941 --> 00:15:37,341
Mr. Amatsuchi? What brings you here?

302
00:15:38,341 --> 00:15:41,141
I recalled forgetting to put the heavy weight

303
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:42,241
of the telescope in the bag.

304
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:44,641
Oh, no.

305
00:15:44,641 --> 00:15:46,641
-By the way, what seems to be the matter? -Oh, nothing...

306
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:49,741
-What the matter? -Nothing...

307
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,241
Did you find something strange?

308
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:53,641
Bones?

309
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,341
-Wait! -Oh no.

310
00:15:58,341 --> 00:16:02,241
What? You found Asao's bones in the forest?

311
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:05,141
But, all you found were the bones, right?

312
00:16:05,141 --> 00:16:07,641
Who knows if they're really Asao's or not?

313
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:10,641
Well, we found this beside the bones.

314
00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:15,241
The pair ring carved with your initials that you gave him.

315
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:19,541
But it could be that the Asao Kono killed somebody

316
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,341
and deliberately put the ring there.

317
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:24,841
But the ring was found...

318
00:16:24,841 --> 00:16:28,241
Did Mr. Kono have a cavity?

319
00:16:29,241 --> 00:16:33,241
His upper tooth to the right, the 2nd one from the molar.

320
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:35,441
His upper molar?

321
00:16:38,741 --> 00:16:41,541
If so, those bones aren't Asao!

322
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:45,341
He did have a cavity all right,

323
00:16:45,341 --> 00:16:47,641
but it was his front lower tooth.

324
00:16:47,641 --> 00:16:49,641
-No! -Then, it's him after all.

325
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,341
No doubt about it.

326
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:54,241
Hey, what do you mean?

327
00:16:54,241 --> 00:16:57,641
I'm sorry to say that the dental treatment was done

328
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,841
on the lower jaw central incisor

329
00:16:59,841 --> 00:17:01,841
In other words, it's exactly where you say it was.

330
00:17:01,841 --> 00:17:05,241
He's lower front tooth had a cavity.

331
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:07,441
He deliberately said something else

332
00:17:07,441 --> 00:17:12,341
so that you wouldn't just agree to what he said.

333
00:17:12,341 --> 00:17:13,941
I'm sorry.

334
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:16,441
Oh no.

335
00:17:16,441 --> 00:17:20,441
Which means that Asao is, Asao is...

336
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:26,541
At any rate, let's hurry and call the police.

337
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,941
But the phone doesn't seem working right.

338
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:34,741
This phone is only connected to an electric cord

339
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:37,041
and doesn't have a module cable.

340
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:40,441
What?

341
00:17:40,441 --> 00:17:44,541
Strange, I used this phone just a while ago.

342
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,141
Do you have any other phones or a spare cable?

343
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:48,941
This is the only phone

344
00:17:48,941 --> 00:17:51,641
and I haven't bought any spare cables.

345
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:54,341
Then, we can't call the police.

346
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:55,641
You have got to be kidding.

347
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,141
I'm going home by car.

348
00:17:58,141 --> 00:17:59,441
But, editor...

349
00:17:59,441 --> 00:18:04,441
I don't think that's possible either.

350
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:05,441
What?

351
00:18:05,441 --> 00:18:07,441
I just went outside and checked,

352
00:18:07,441 --> 00:18:11,841
but it seems all the cars that are parked here have flat tires.

353
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:15,741
Somebody probably loosened the air valve and deflated the tires.

354
00:18:15,741 --> 00:18:18,141
So that no one could use the cars,

355
00:18:18,141 --> 00:18:20,441
in order to keep everyone confined here.

356
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:22,541
That's absurd.

357
00:18:23,741 --> 00:18:27,641
Hey, don't tell me this has something to do with the guy Kono?

358
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:29,741
-I'm sure it does. -For sure.

359
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,141
Because that was homi...

360
00:18:32,141 --> 00:18:34,441
Come to think of it, when I found the bones,

361
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:36,841
you guys were watching, right?

362
00:18:36,841 --> 00:18:40,041
You saw the four long cigarettes and two short cigarettes

363
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,241
on the handkerchief, didn't you?

364
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:45,441
Hey! Isn't that a dying message?

365
00:18:47,441 --> 00:18:49,141
No, I wouldn't say it was...

366
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:53,541
No. That's no dying message.

367
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,641
I'm sure that...

368
00:18:55,641 --> 00:19:03,541
Asao is just pretending to be dead to trouble me.

369
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,941
-He's so cute. -Anyway, let's all stay in our rooms tonight

370
00:19:05,941 --> 00:19:07,241
and not go out.

371
00:19:07,241 --> 00:19:10,241
I think it's best to wait until daybreak.

372
00:19:10,241 --> 00:19:11,241
Yes.

373
00:19:32,641 --> 00:19:34,841
There are a total of six cigarettes,

374
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,341
four long ones and two short ones.

375
00:19:37,341 --> 00:19:39,441
If the name is Futagawa, there is one extra match

376
00:19:39,441 --> 00:19:42,241
and if the name is Amatsuchi, one more match stick is needed.

377
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:43,841
As for Ms. Nonomiya and Mr. Mikami,

378
00:19:43,841 --> 00:19:46,141
their characters cannot be displayed with six matches.

379
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:48,241
What if you write it in katakana?

380
00:19:48,241 --> 00:19:49,741
That's impossible too.

381
00:19:49,741 --> 00:19:51,941
Futagawa would require 14 match sticks

382
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:56,041
and Amatsuchi 12, eight for Nonomiya

383
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:59,541
and for Mikami, nine matches would be necessary.

384
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,741
What if you try their initials?

385
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:06,241
Like for Haibara Ai, it would be "HA", that's exactly six matches.

386
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:11,341
Then, are you saying that you're the killer?

387
00:20:12,941 --> 00:20:14,941
Like I said, it's just an example.

388
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:17,941
Oh, an example.

389
00:20:17,941 --> 00:20:20,841
Come to think of it Tsuburaya Mitsuhiko, TM

390
00:20:20,841 --> 00:20:23,841
and Yoshida Ayumi, YA are also six matches.

391
00:20:23,841 --> 00:20:25,341
True.

392
00:20:25,341 --> 00:20:28,341
Kojima Genta is...

393
00:20:29,441 --> 00:20:33,341
How romantic to think that only the three of us require six match sticks.

394
00:20:33,341 --> 00:20:37,141
I'm Agasa Hiroshi, AH and can be displayed with six matches too.

395
00:20:37,141 --> 00:20:39,941
Wow, what a coincidence?

396
00:20:39,941 --> 00:20:41,141
Hey.

397
00:20:41,141 --> 00:20:45,141
You just may be right about it being initials.

398
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:49,141
What? The killer is Mr. Futagawa?

399
00:20:49,141 --> 00:20:53,241
Yeah. If those cigarettes really stand for initials...

400
00:20:54,241 --> 00:20:56,541
Mr. Amatsuchi Ryoji is AR,

401
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,041
Nonomiya Etsuko is NE,

402
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,741
Mikami Heihachi is MH.

403
00:21:01,741 --> 00:21:05,741
Only Futagawa Hajime, FH can be created with six matches, right?

404
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:09,141
But, I wonder if it's a good idea to go see Mr. Futagawa in person.

405
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:12,541
Don't worry, I'm just going to throw him a catch question.

406
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,341
Mr. Futagawa's not here

407
00:21:21,341 --> 00:21:24,041
The cigarette filter is still damp.

408
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,341
Not too long has passed yet since he left the room.

409
00:21:27,641 --> 00:21:29,441
Somebody's walking outside.

410
00:21:30,441 --> 00:21:32,641
That's Ms. Nonomiya?

411
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:34,941
Oh no, not only Mr, Futagawa

412
00:21:34,941 --> 00:21:37,841
but Mr. Mikami and Mr. Amatsuchi are nowhere in sight either.

413
00:21:37,841 --> 00:21:40,541
Darn. I told them not to go outside.

414
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:44,041
Mitsuhiko, Ayumi and I will go get Ms. Nonomiya back.

415
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:47,141
Dr. Agasa, Ai and Genta, go and look for the other three.

416
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:49,141
Okay.

417
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,541
Ms. Nonomiya!

418
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,041
Where are you?

419
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,341
Ms. Nonomiya!

420
00:21:54,341 --> 00:21:59,741
That's the road that leads to the place we found the skeleton, right?

421
00:21:59,741 --> 00:22:02,141
Then, maybe she went there to confirm

422
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:04,141
if the bones were really Mr. Kono's.

423
00:22:04,141 --> 00:22:05,541
Oh no.

424
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,241
What was that sound?

425
00:22:09,841 --> 00:22:11,041
Mr. Futagawa?

426
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,641
No good. His neck is broken.

427
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:16,641
-What? -What?

428
00:22:16,641 --> 00:22:17,941
He's not breathing anymore.

429
00:22:18,941 --> 00:22:21,141
He's holding something.

430
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:22,541
A cigarette case?

431
00:22:25,441 --> 00:22:28,141
The same dying message again?

432
00:22:28,141 --> 00:22:30,241
No, this time...

433
00:22:30,241 --> 00:22:32,341
there's one more.

434
00:24:31,968 --> 00:24:34,368
Next Conan's Hint:

435
00:24:34,368 --> 00:24:36,268
"Initial"

436
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:37,468
Next week, the case will be solved.

437
00:24:37,468 --> 00:24:39,468
The highlight is my super acting skills.
