1
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:03,903
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:05,803
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:05,803 --> 00:00:07,503
An eerie villa with a story behind it.

4
00:00:07,503 --> 00:00:10,603
What is the silhouette that appears in the window that is closed off?

5
00:00:10,603 --> 00:00:12,003
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:13,703
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,703 --> 00:00:15,603
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:08,047 --> 00:02:09,347
Sonoko.

9
00:03:02,947 --> 00:03:06,047
Stone-paper-scissors...

10
00:03:08,447 --> 00:03:10,447
Me, again?

11
00:03:10,447 --> 00:03:11,847
Sorry.

12
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:14,547
Be patient for 10 minutes more.

13
00:03:14,547 --> 00:03:16,447
You didn't invite me here

14
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:18,947
knowing I'm not good at playing stone-paper-scissors, did you?

15
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:21,447
To make up for your efforts,

16
00:03:21,447 --> 00:03:25,047
I want you to make yourself at home later at the Suzuki family villa.

17
00:03:26,347 --> 00:03:27,947
Your villa?

18
00:03:27,947 --> 00:03:31,547
Wasn't it a pension owned by your sister's friend?

19
00:03:31,547 --> 00:03:34,947
Huh? Did I say that?

20
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:36,847
Don't tell me that

21
00:03:36,847 --> 00:03:41,547
it's that villa where the murder of the bandaged man occurred?

22
00:03:41,547 --> 00:03:43,447
I still remember that case, too.

23
00:03:45,847 --> 00:03:48,347
No way! I'm going home!

24
00:03:48,347 --> 00:03:49,447
Impossible.

25
00:03:49,447 --> 00:03:51,247
You have no sense of direction, do you?

26
00:03:51,247 --> 00:03:52,347
But...

27
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:56,647
I see why Sonoko sent the car back halfway

28
00:03:56,647 --> 00:03:59,447
and made us all walk the mountain road up to the villa.

29
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:04,447
This way, Ran wouldn't be able to leave after getting scared.

30
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:06,147
Sonoko, that fool.

31
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:11,647
By the way, has the case been solved?

32
00:04:11,647 --> 00:04:15,247
Absolutely solved. Thanks to Deduction Queen Sonoko.

33
00:04:15,247 --> 00:04:17,547
Right, since that case,

34
00:04:17,547 --> 00:04:22,147
you've been solving cases like my dad, as if you were sleeping.

35
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,647
And when I was assaulted by the Bandaged Man,

36
00:04:26,647 --> 00:04:28,847
Conan helped me out.

37
00:04:31,747 --> 00:04:33,947
So he was at the site, too.

38
00:04:33,947 --> 00:04:37,147
Well, I will tell you the details after we arrive at the villa.

39
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,247
I can't believe it!

40
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:43,547
The bridge!

41
00:04:44,947 --> 00:04:48,547
Don't tell me someone is up to no good again.

42
00:04:49,847 --> 00:04:53,547
No, it must have collapsed from the base.

43
00:04:53,547 --> 00:04:55,547
This is simply a cheat in construction work.

44
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:57,247
Is it?

45
00:04:57,247 --> 00:04:59,247
But we're in trouble.

46
00:04:59,247 --> 00:05:01,447
We can't reach the villa.

47
00:05:01,447 --> 00:05:03,247
The car already left.

48
00:05:03,247 --> 00:05:06,347
My sister and the others will be coming, but that's tonight.

49
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,347
Then, let's call them by cell phone.

50
00:05:08,347 --> 00:05:09,847
I'm sure they'll come right away.

51
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:11,447
Sorry,

52
00:05:11,447 --> 00:05:13,147
but this place is outside of the cell phone service range.

53
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:14,947
No way.

54
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,847
Then let's do this.

55
00:05:16,847 --> 00:05:19,947
Let's go to that villa and borrow the phone there.

56
00:05:19,947 --> 00:05:22,447
There may be someone inside.

57
00:05:25,647 --> 00:05:31,347
"Sealed Western-style Window (Part 1)"

58
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:38,347
Looks like no one's home.

59
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,047
Who are you people?

60
00:05:53,347 --> 00:05:56,147
Oh, you mean the bridge leading to that villa?

61
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,947
Come to think of it, it's broken.

62
00:05:57,947 --> 00:06:02,047
Yes. I would like to use your phone and call someone to come pick us up.

63
00:06:02,047 --> 00:06:03,247
"Jun Makino (29)" -No problem.

64
00:06:03,247 --> 00:06:06,547
You can kill time here till they come.

65
00:06:06,547 --> 00:06:08,847
-Thank you very much. -Thank you very much.

66
00:06:08,847 --> 00:06:12,047
This is a very nice villa.

67
00:06:12,047 --> 00:06:16,647
Your remark should go to the rich man who built this.

68
00:06:16,647 --> 00:06:20,347
"Toru Tendou (30)" -We just beat down the price of it and got it.

69
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:23,047
We're just ordinary citizens.

70
00:06:23,047 --> 00:06:24,347
You bought this for a cheap price?

71
00:06:24,347 --> 00:06:27,747
Yes. We're members of a band.

72
00:06:27,747 --> 00:06:29,747
In other words, musicians.

73
00:06:29,747 --> 00:06:34,247
I was looking for a place where I could write music and lyrics in peace.

74
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:37,247
That was when we found this rarity.

75
00:06:38,547 --> 00:06:41,547
But it must've cost a lot, despite it being a good buy.

76
00:06:41,547 --> 00:06:44,047
No, it was really cheap.

77
00:06:44,047 --> 00:06:46,947
"Yoji Kuramoto (28)" -Something about this place having a story behind it.

78
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:49,347
They were planning to demolish it if they couldn't sell it.

79
00:06:50,847 --> 00:06:52,547
-A story behind it? -A story behind it?

80
00:06:52,547 --> 00:06:53,647
Right.

81
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:56,647
Originally, multimillionaire brothers seem to have built this place.

82
00:06:56,647 --> 00:06:58,647
They would bring their wives here around this time

83
00:06:58,647 --> 00:07:00,647
every year to avoid the heat.

84
00:07:03,647 --> 00:07:05,947
But one night, when it was raining heavily,

85
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:08,847
the older brother started saying something strange.

86
00:07:14,347 --> 00:07:17,747
"I saw an unidentifiable devil come in from the window."

87
00:07:17,747 --> 00:07:18,947
A...

88
00:07:18,947 --> 00:07:20,147
Devil?

89
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:32,947
After that, they nailed the window and closed it off immediately.

90
00:07:36,547 --> 00:07:38,747
No good. The devil has already...

91
00:07:41,147 --> 00:07:43,047
possessed this place!

92
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:46,847
The older brother later refurbished this villa.

93
00:07:46,847 --> 00:07:50,147
He changed the floors, the wallpapers and renewed everything.

94
00:07:50,147 --> 00:07:53,247
But one year after the refurbishing the house,

95
00:07:53,247 --> 00:07:56,247
the first incident occurred.

96
00:07:56,247 --> 00:07:58,247
Incident?

97
00:07:58,247 --> 00:08:00,547
It involved the older brother's wife.

98
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:03,247
While she was gardening,

99
00:08:03,247 --> 00:08:05,247
she saw something.

100
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:07,947
From the window that was supposed to be sealed,

101
00:08:07,947 --> 00:08:09,347
something was staring at her.

102
00:08:12,447 --> 00:08:14,047
What was it?

103
00:08:14,047 --> 00:08:15,547
Was it the devil?

104
00:08:15,547 --> 00:08:16,747
Maybe.

105
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:20,547
A few days later,

106
00:08:20,547 --> 00:08:23,447
she was almost possessed by the devil.

107
00:08:23,447 --> 00:08:27,047
She used a rope and killed herself in her room.

108
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:30,647
Even the older brother, as if he were chasing after her,

109
00:08:30,647 --> 00:08:34,147
killed himself by jumping from the window of his room on the third floor.

110
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:40,547
After that, only the younger brother and his wife stayed at this villa.

111
00:08:40,547 --> 00:08:42,747
This is why it was so cheap.

112
00:08:44,447 --> 00:08:45,847
Well?

113
00:08:45,847 --> 00:08:49,447
Don't you think this is a good place to create good music and lyrics?

114
00:08:49,447 --> 00:08:51,147
Yeah.

115
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:54,147
Hey, hey. What kind of music is it?

116
00:08:54,147 --> 00:08:58,047
But does that window really unable to be opened?

117
00:08:58,047 --> 00:09:01,647
Go check it out yourself. Come.

118
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:09,647
I see.

119
00:09:09,647 --> 00:09:11,847
The window has been nailed shut.

120
00:09:14,647 --> 00:09:16,347
It won't budge an inch.

121
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,647
See?

122
00:09:17,647 --> 00:09:20,947
When we bought it, they told us that they would fix the window,

123
00:09:20,947 --> 00:09:24,047
but we left it as it is, because we thought it was a sheer waste.

124
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:25,647
You should have had it fixed.

125
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:27,547
Want to stay overnight?

126
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:30,247
You may be able to see the devil.

127
00:09:30,247 --> 00:09:31,647
No, thank you.

128
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,047
We just want to use your phone.

129
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:37,247
I'm glad you all came back as we were leaving.

130
00:09:37,247 --> 00:09:41,147
What? We went out to buy some food.

131
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:44,147
But one person should have been here. Rinko.

132
00:09:44,147 --> 00:09:45,447
Rinko?

133
00:09:47,847 --> 00:09:49,347
"Rinko Honami (28)" -Hey.

134
00:09:49,347 --> 00:09:53,247
Can't you all be quiet around here?

135
00:09:53,247 --> 00:09:55,847
How can I write songs like this?

136
00:09:57,547 --> 00:09:59,047
That's Rinko.

137
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:00,647
She uses the room next door.

138
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:03,247
Since she came here, she has always been acting like that.

139
00:10:03,247 --> 00:10:04,647
Always irritated.

140
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:08,947
We can't complain, because the life of our band "Dorcus"

141
00:10:08,947 --> 00:10:10,347
depends on the music she makes.

142
00:10:10,347 --> 00:10:12,347
What? Did you say "Dorcus"?

143
00:10:12,347 --> 00:10:13,947
I know you!

144
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,347
You're well known among the Indies, aren't you?

145
00:10:16,347 --> 00:10:18,747
I even have one of your CDs!

146
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:21,247
Oh, thanks a lot.

147
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:22,747
I wonder which way.

148
00:10:24,247 --> 00:10:26,347
Here you are.

149
00:10:26,347 --> 00:10:28,847
I finally talked to my sister.

150
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:31,047
She told me she can get here in two hours or so and pick us up.

151
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,647
Great!

152
00:10:32,647 --> 00:10:35,147
Okay. Then...

153
00:10:35,147 --> 00:10:37,947
Let's go out to the backyard while waiting for her, shall we?

154
00:10:37,947 --> 00:10:40,347
I want to see the window from outside.

155
00:10:40,347 --> 00:10:42,047
The window where the devil supposedly looked in through.

156
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:47,147
The window is the fourth one from the right on the second floor.

157
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,447
That one.

158
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,447
From the outside, it looks like an ordinary window.

159
00:10:51,447 --> 00:10:54,647
It doesn't look all that haunted.

160
00:10:54,647 --> 00:10:57,147
Was the devil really looking through the window?

161
00:10:57,147 --> 00:10:58,447
They say so.

162
00:11:03,447 --> 00:11:06,247
Look. There's a bird's nest up there.

163
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:07,547
I see it, too.

164
00:11:07,547 --> 00:11:09,647
Be careful, Conan.

165
00:11:10,847 --> 00:11:12,847
There's nothing inside.

166
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:15,547
It doesn't look like birds built a nest here either.

167
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:21,047
But there is a white plate in here.

168
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,147
Strange to find a plate in a birdhouse, isn't it?

169
00:11:24,147 --> 00:11:26,847
What? Let me see it.

170
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,547
You'd better not, Eisuke.

171
00:11:31,347 --> 00:11:34,147
It hurts...

172
00:11:34,147 --> 00:11:36,547
You are really a klutz, aren't you?

173
00:11:36,547 --> 00:11:37,847
Are you okay?

174
00:11:39,347 --> 00:11:41,247
I guess I am okay.

175
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:44,447
Now, let's move toward the terrace.

176
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,747
What is it this time?

177
00:11:48,747 --> 00:11:49,847
What's that?

178
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:56,647
Something's up there.

179
00:11:56,647 --> 00:12:00,947
Something was gazing at us from the sealed window!

180
00:12:00,947 --> 00:12:02,247
Come on.

181
00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:05,247
Did you hit your head or something when you fell down a while ago?

182
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,347
No, I'm not lying!

183
00:12:07,347 --> 00:12:08,347
Conan?

184
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:21,247
What's up, kid?

185
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:31,047
It's completely sealed.

186
00:12:31,047 --> 00:12:33,047
There are no traces of nails being removed either.

187
00:12:35,447 --> 00:12:36,947
Rinko.

188
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:38,547
Hey, Rinko.

189
00:12:38,547 --> 00:12:40,247
Hurry and open the door.

190
00:12:40,247 --> 00:12:41,847
Rinko.

191
00:12:41,847 --> 00:12:44,947
What's going on?

192
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:48,147
I bought a CD that Rinko asked me to buy for her,

193
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:50,747
when I went out to buy food a while ago.

194
00:12:50,747 --> 00:12:53,947
I wanted to give it to her, but she's not answering the door.

195
00:12:54,947 --> 00:12:56,847
She looked annoyed just now.

196
00:12:56,847 --> 00:12:59,047
So maybe she sulked out and went to sleep?

197
00:13:09,094 --> 00:13:10,894
Hey!

198
00:13:10,894 --> 00:13:12,994
Rinko!

199
00:13:12,994 --> 00:13:14,494
-Rinko! -Rinko!

200
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:18,094
Hey!

201
00:13:18,094 --> 00:13:19,594
Rinko!

202
00:13:19,594 --> 00:13:21,194
What's the matter, Rinko?

203
00:13:21,194 --> 00:13:24,894
Rinko!

204
00:13:24,894 --> 00:13:27,294
I got the CD you asked for.

205
00:13:27,294 --> 00:13:28,994
Open the door. Hey!

206
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:32,294
Something's wrong.

207
00:13:32,294 --> 00:13:34,394
We're making this much noise.

208
00:13:34,394 --> 00:13:37,094
Knowing Rinko, she would be coming out like a while ago.

209
00:13:37,094 --> 00:13:40,394
How can I write songs like this?

210
00:13:41,894 --> 00:13:43,994
Well, I guess...

211
00:13:43,994 --> 00:13:46,394
Something's wrong after all.

212
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,194
No good. I can't see well.

213
00:13:51,194 --> 00:13:53,694
You try it, will you, kid?

214
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:54,894
Okay.

215
00:13:58,894 --> 00:14:01,794
Do you have a small mirror?

216
00:14:01,794 --> 00:14:03,794
What? Yes.

217
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:15,794
What's this?

218
00:14:19,094 --> 00:14:20,494
What's up, Toru?

219
00:14:20,494 --> 00:14:21,694
What's wrong?

220
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,794
I can see her feet.

221
00:14:23,794 --> 00:14:24,894
They're suspended.

222
00:14:27,094 --> 00:14:29,294
Hey, does that mean...

223
00:14:30,894 --> 00:14:32,594
-One, two, three. -One, two, three.

224
00:14:47,294 --> 00:14:48,394
Rinko!

225
00:14:50,994 --> 00:14:53,594
It can't be! Why, Rinko?

226
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:55,494
First, lie her down.

227
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,694
Ask for an ambulance and police.

228
00:15:03,394 --> 00:15:06,394
The room seems to be locked completely.

229
00:15:06,394 --> 00:15:08,094
And that key

230
00:15:08,094 --> 00:15:10,294
must've come from the key holder on her hip.

231
00:15:13,194 --> 00:15:14,594
Those...

232
00:15:14,594 --> 00:15:17,494
Those are the keys for her car, bicycle and car.

233
00:15:17,494 --> 00:15:21,994
The black cover is probably an electronic key for the house.

234
00:15:21,994 --> 00:15:24,294
Then the key to this room...

235
00:15:24,294 --> 00:15:25,294
Where is it?

236
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:36,394
Here it is!

237
00:15:37,794 --> 00:15:42,994
But the door and the window are all locked.

238
00:15:42,994 --> 00:15:45,894
This room seems to be completely closed off.

239
00:15:45,894 --> 00:15:47,894
Is this really a suicide?

240
00:15:48,994 --> 00:15:50,094
No good.

241
00:15:50,094 --> 00:15:51,694
She is not breathing.

242
00:15:54,594 --> 00:15:56,094
That means the one staring at us

243
00:15:56,094 --> 00:15:59,994
from the sealed window earlier

244
00:15:59,994 --> 00:16:01,794
must be the devil!

245
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,294
What?

246
00:16:03,294 --> 00:16:05,894
Don't tell me you really saw it?

247
00:16:05,894 --> 00:16:06,994
Yes.

248
00:16:06,994 --> 00:16:09,294
Not us. Eisuke's the one who saw it.

249
00:16:09,294 --> 00:16:10,494
I'm sure.

250
00:16:10,494 --> 00:16:12,294
It was a few minutes ago in the backyard.

251
00:16:12,294 --> 00:16:13,894
You!

252
00:16:13,894 --> 00:16:15,694
Are you sure you were not half asleep?

253
00:16:15,694 --> 00:16:17,294
I am telling the truth!

254
00:16:17,294 --> 00:16:19,794
It was dark so I couldn't really see it clearly,

255
00:16:19,794 --> 00:16:22,894
but I'm sure that something was looking out the window.

256
00:16:22,894 --> 00:16:25,894
Are you sure your glasses weren't dirty?

257
00:16:25,894 --> 00:16:27,394
Come on.

258
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:29,694
But, if what he said is true,

259
00:16:29,694 --> 00:16:34,194
maybe something is living here.

260
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,894
Because this room is the one

261
00:16:36,894 --> 00:16:40,194
where the wife of the older brother killed herself.

262
00:16:46,294 --> 00:16:48,994
Anyway, let's carry Rinko to the sofa.

263
00:16:48,994 --> 00:16:51,294
It's too pitiful to let Rinko lying on the cold floor.

264
00:16:52,294 --> 00:16:54,494
Hey, you're stepping on the keys.

265
00:16:55,894 --> 00:16:57,594
Sorry, Rinko.

266
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,394
I see.

267
00:17:10,394 --> 00:17:13,094
Let me sort out the circumstances.

268
00:17:13,094 --> 00:17:18,294
You wanted to give the CD that Rinko asked you to get for her.

269
00:17:18,294 --> 00:17:20,194
You knocked the door, but no one answered.

270
00:17:20,194 --> 00:17:22,294
Everyone sensed that something was wrong.

271
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:23,794
When you looked into through the opening of the door,

272
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:25,794
you saw her feet suspended in the air.

273
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:30,194
You broke through the locked door and went inside.

274
00:17:30,194 --> 00:17:34,394
Then you found Rinko dead in this condition, right?

275
00:17:34,394 --> 00:17:35,994
Yes.

276
00:17:35,994 --> 00:17:38,594
Then who has the key for this room?

277
00:17:38,594 --> 00:17:42,094
The key holder is on her hip.

278
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:45,094
The key was on the keyboard.

279
00:17:49,394 --> 00:17:53,494
This is the key for this room, isn't it?

280
00:17:53,494 --> 00:17:55,894
Don't you have any spare keys?

281
00:17:55,894 --> 00:17:58,094
No, that's all there is.

282
00:17:58,094 --> 00:18:01,194
But someone could've made a spare key secretly.

283
00:18:01,194 --> 00:18:02,794
No way.

284
00:18:02,794 --> 00:18:07,294
When we bought this house, Rinko changed all locks to the rooms.

285
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,394
And...

286
00:18:08,394 --> 00:18:11,694
She handed a key to each of us herself.

287
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:17,694
So after you broke the door and entered,

288
00:18:17,694 --> 00:18:21,094
could someone have locked the window in secret?

289
00:18:21,094 --> 00:18:22,894
No way.

290
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:26,094
The only one who walked around this room

291
00:18:26,094 --> 00:18:28,294
is that boy over there.

292
00:18:28,294 --> 00:18:32,194
All windows were locked.

293
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,294
You didn't mess with the windows, right?

294
00:18:35,294 --> 00:18:38,194
Thus, the door was locked and the window was closed, too.

295
00:18:38,194 --> 00:18:40,794
The room was completely closed.

296
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:44,494
So this is nothing other than suicide.

297
00:18:44,494 --> 00:18:46,494
Excuse me.

298
00:18:46,494 --> 00:18:49,694
Its what you think I might say, but the fact is otherwise.

299
00:18:51,194 --> 00:18:55,194
This is a locked-room murder that was cleverly set up by someone!

300
00:18:57,394 --> 00:19:00,094
And the murderer is among you.

301
00:19:01,494 --> 00:19:03,494
Isn't that right, Mr. Mouri?

302
00:19:05,094 --> 00:19:06,794
Huh?

303
00:19:06,794 --> 00:19:08,094
Where is Mr. Mouri?

304
00:19:08,094 --> 00:19:10,194
He's not here.

305
00:19:11,694 --> 00:19:13,494
Why not?

306
00:19:13,494 --> 00:19:17,294
Even though Ran, Conan and you, with the glasses are all here?

307
00:19:17,294 --> 00:19:19,194
Why isn't he here?

308
00:19:19,194 --> 00:19:21,794
Don't ask me.

309
00:19:25,294 --> 00:19:26,594
Hey.

310
00:19:26,594 --> 00:19:30,494
Why are you sure that this is a locked-room murder, officer?

311
00:19:30,494 --> 00:19:33,894
It would be hard for other people, but for we police officers,

312
00:19:33,894 --> 00:19:36,794
we can tell right away just by looking at this chair.

313
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:40,894
In the case of suicide using a rope,

314
00:19:40,894 --> 00:19:43,394
the person usually kicks the chair down.

315
00:19:43,394 --> 00:19:44,894
But in this case,

316
00:19:44,894 --> 00:19:47,994
the chair is left standing and moreover, it is right under the rope.

317
00:19:47,994 --> 00:19:50,194
In other words, someone strangled Rinko,

318
00:19:50,194 --> 00:19:53,894
killed her and suspended her corpse in the air. This is the evidence.

319
00:19:53,894 --> 00:19:58,394
Sir, the chair was placed there after we broke the door

320
00:19:58,394 --> 00:20:00,394
and entered this room.

321
00:20:00,394 --> 00:20:02,494
Why?

322
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:05,094
To bring down Rinko.

323
00:20:05,094 --> 00:20:07,894
We thought she was still alive.

324
00:20:07,894 --> 00:20:10,194
Besides, when we entered the room,

325
00:20:10,194 --> 00:20:12,794
if I remember correctly, the chair was lying on the floor.

326
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,894
Is that right?

327
00:20:14,894 --> 00:20:16,794
Then, this case is undoubtedly suicide.

328
00:20:18,994 --> 00:20:20,594
It can't be helped, then.

329
00:20:23,094 --> 00:20:25,494
What is this?

330
00:20:25,494 --> 00:20:27,194
This is interesting!

331
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,394
Conan, what are you doing?

332
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:31,794
Stop it!

333
00:20:31,794 --> 00:20:35,494
It has a ruler on it and looks like a tape measure!

334
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,294
Hey, stop that!

335
00:20:39,694 --> 00:20:43,294
This key holder sure stretches pretty far, doesn't it?

336
00:20:46,394 --> 00:20:48,194
Rinko told me it's an interesting gadget

337
00:20:48,194 --> 00:20:51,094
that can also be used as a tape measure.

338
00:20:51,094 --> 00:20:54,094
Something about it stretching about five meters.

339
00:20:55,194 --> 00:20:56,294
Handy, isn't it?

340
00:20:56,294 --> 00:20:59,894
Handy? Is that all?

341
00:20:59,894 --> 00:21:01,594
Hey, Ran.

342
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,494
If you've got a key on the key holder that can be extended that far,

343
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:07,494
you can open the door of this room from far away, too.

344
00:21:08,794 --> 00:21:11,494
You're not so smart, Conan.

345
00:21:11,494 --> 00:21:13,194
You can't open a door that far

346
00:21:13,194 --> 00:21:17,294
unless you can extend your arm that far, don't you think?

347
00:21:17,294 --> 00:21:18,994
No, that's not it.

348
00:21:18,994 --> 00:21:20,194
Wait a minute.

349
00:21:20,194 --> 00:21:23,794
If the key to this room is on that key holder...

350
00:21:23,794 --> 00:21:24,894
That's right.

351
00:21:24,894 --> 00:21:26,794
This room can be closed from outside.

352
00:21:28,694 --> 00:21:32,794
Look at the distance between the place where Rinko was and the door.

353
00:21:32,794 --> 00:21:34,994
If it's this distance,

354
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,894
the key holder on Rinko's hip can be extended

355
00:21:37,894 --> 00:21:39,994
and pulled through the space under the door.

356
00:21:39,994 --> 00:21:41,994
The culprit leaves and locked the room.

357
00:21:45,694 --> 00:21:47,494
When the culprit let go...

358
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:51,194
it automatically springs back

359
00:21:51,194 --> 00:21:54,694
and returns to Rinko's key holder on her hip.

360
00:21:54,694 --> 00:21:58,694
But the key to this room was removed from the key holder.

361
00:22:00,394 --> 00:22:02,194
Before Rinko killed herself,

362
00:22:02,194 --> 00:22:04,494
she might have tried to erase the possibility of a murder

363
00:22:04,494 --> 00:22:06,994
for fear that she might get her friends into trouble.

364
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:08,194
Or...

365
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,894
it may be that someone killed Rinko and made it look like suicide

366
00:22:10,894 --> 00:22:16,794
and then destroyed the evidence pointing to it being a murder?

367
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:18,194
I see.

368
00:22:18,194 --> 00:22:19,794
Wait a minute.

369
00:22:19,794 --> 00:22:22,494
Are you saying that there is a murderer among us?

370
00:22:22,494 --> 00:22:23,694
Cut it out!

371
00:22:23,694 --> 00:22:24,694
You have to be joking!

372
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,460
Next Conan's Hint:

373
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,460
"The order the books are placed"

374
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,120
Next week, I will be solving the case!

375
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,900
I wonder if everything's going to turn out okay?
