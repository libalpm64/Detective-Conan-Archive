1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,080
Alibis, secret codes, tricks and deals.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,180
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,780
Today's stage is a theatre.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,880
A crime show from projector!

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,480
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,480
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,980
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,190
All five members of the Youth Detective Squad

9
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,290
came to watch the movies with the movie tickets

10
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,890
that we received from Dr. Agasa.

11
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,590
After some argument,

12
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,190
we decide to see a three-part "Gomera" movie.

13
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,390
However, we find out that this theatre is to be closed down today.

14
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,090
We turn out to be the last customers.

15
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,590
But while we are enjoying the movie,

16
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,890
a black shadow appears on the screen.

17
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,390
Moreover,

18
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,290
that corpse turns out to be that of Hatta, the real estate agent

19
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,290
who had cornered this theatre into closing down!

20
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,390
After investigations,

21
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,190
just when this case was about to be closed as suicide...

22
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,890
What's wrong, Mitsuhiko?

23
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,090
I... I saw it.

24
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,690
What...

25
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,390
Well...

26
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,090
she was in front of the mirror of the ladies room,

27
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,390
holding her eyes down as if she was crying!

28
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:58,790
"Last Show for Murder (Part 2)"

29
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,590
What?

30
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,190
Hey, when was that?

31
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:09,190
Just before the shadow appeared on the screen during the scene.

32
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,090
Would you like to explain?

33
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,290
Didn't you say you were in that room

34
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,090
right through after you brought the lunch to the projection room?

35
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,290
Well, it's contact lens.

36
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,890
Contact lens?

37
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,090
I went to the restroom while I was boiling the water

38
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,090
because my contact lens slipped out of place.

39
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,990
Since it took me less than a minute,

40
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,590
so I didn't mention it.

41
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,490
Did you know that?

42
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:40,490
No, because I was in the projection room.

43
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,890
But that's nothing to be concerned over

44
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,490
because she was with me the instant the shadow appeared.

45
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,790
Inspector!

46
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,690
The late Mr. Hatta, seemed to have a lot of debts due to gambling.

47
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,190
He couldn't possibly pay them all off

48
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,590
even from the profit he was supposed to get

49
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,090
after selling this theatre.

50
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,690
According to the neighbors,

51
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,390
they say that Mr. Hatta's real estate agency

52
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,590
would've gone bankrupt sooner or later.

53
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,990
I see.

54
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:15,490
So he did have a motive for committing suicide.

55
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,590
He really is a nuisance.

56
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,990
Why doesn't he go commit suicide somewhere else?

57
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,690
Hey, stop it!

58
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,290
Suicide?

59
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:28,490
It's true that he could've used a ladder,

60
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,590
put a rope through it and hung himself.

61
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,790
But he didn't look like one who was considering suicide.

62
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,290
Something sure bothers me.

63
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,790
The temperature of the air conditioner was not set as usual,

64
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,290
and that scene...

65
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,290
And her strange action...

66
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,090
Oh, Dr. Agasa!

67
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,490
What?

68
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,590
It's a wonder you found us.

69
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,590
The Inspector contacted me,

70
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,890
so I rushed over to come pick you up.

71
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:07,190
What? Where are Conan, Ayumi and Ai?

72
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,190
Oh, those three are in the restroom.

73
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,090
The restroom is located

74
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:21,090
beyond the corridor on the left facing the screen.

75
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:24,390
It's straight down a flight of stairs from the projection room, but...

76
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,590
No matter how I think about it, I still don't understand.

77
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,090
Why did that person go out of the way to here?

78
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,090
Why on earth?

79
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,390
Oh, my.

80
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,790
It doesn't bother you, does it?

81
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,390
I get chills running through my spine

82
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,590
every morning I see myself in it.

83
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,790
"Who are you anyway?", I ask.

84
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,990
Hey! I'm this way thanks to the drug you made.

85
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,390
That's true. I really am sorry.

86
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,390
You, who are pursuing the truth

87
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,690
is deceiving everyone.

88
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,490
Even this mirror that reflects everything just like it is,

89
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,290
will not reflect you in your true form.

90
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,590
Thanks, Ai!

91
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,790
What?

92
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,890
What's with Conan?

93
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,990
This is the ladies room!

94
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,390
I see!

95
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,790
I see! That's what it was!

96
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,590
That's why that scene...

97
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,690
If so...

98
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,990
If my deductions is correct,

99
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,090
that thing should be over there.

100
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,390
Hey, kid?

101
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,690
Hey!

102
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:56,990
I got it! The ash from the cigarettes as well as cigarette butts!

103
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,590
And...

104
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,090
the shoes marks on the seat in front!

105
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,790
There's no doubt!

106
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,690
The criminal is that person.

107
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,690
That person killed Mr. Hatta

108
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:13,390
by taking full advantage of the theatre

109
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,390
that is a space of darkness and light.

110
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,190
What? You've figured out who the criminal is?

111
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,490
What...

112
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,790
You say handkerchief?

113
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,690
Are you serious, Shinichi?

114
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,090
Yes.

115
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,790
I also figured out the trick of darkness and light

116
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,790
that the criminal used!

117
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,590
But what do you intend to do?

118
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,790
I just came here,

119
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,190
so I can't play the role of detective, you know?

120
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,590
You'll do fine.

121
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:47,890
All you have to do is tell them you heard about everything from me!

122
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,490
And to start things off, you...

123
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,090
It's not fair!

124
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:59,190
You're the only one who ever figure everything out.

125
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,890
You're running out on us again?

126
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,490
You'll lose friends this way!

127
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,490
Don't be angry.

128
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:10,390
I have something I'd like you all to do something this time!

129
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,990
Really?

130
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,790
Inspector!

131
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:22,190
According to one of the employees at Mr. Hatta's real estate agency,

132
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,390
it seems that he has been quite irritated recently,

133
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:29,990
and got into a fight with the bank that he had transactions with today.

134
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,390
A fight?

135
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,390
Yes!

136
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,790
Something about they wouldn't lend him the money

137
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,290
to buy this theatre, that he was short some 1,000,000 yen.

138
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:41,590
What? Which means that this theatre hasn't been sold yet?

139
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,590
No.

140
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,690
As for the formal agreement and cash transactions,

141
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,490
we were supposed to do it tomorrow.

142
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,590
He was probably trying to complain about this place and pay less for it!

143
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,490
What a dirty rat!

144
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,090
I see.

145
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,990
In addition to management difficulties he was having at his company,

146
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,590
he couldn't come up with the cash for buying this place

147
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,890
and was on the verge of bankruptcy.

148
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,890
He got sick of everything and committed suicide.

149
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:09,390
It's not unthinkable.

150
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,590
Excuse me?

151
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:14,090
May I leave? I have another engagement.

152
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,990
I guess it's okay, since it looks to be suicide.

153
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,290
I guess so. We'll get back to you at a later date...

154
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,690
What is it?

155
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,290
Who is it? Who turned off the lights?

156
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,990
Me, it's me!

157
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,590
Oh, Dr. Agasa?

158
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,490
Hey, what do you think you're doing in the projection room?

159
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,790
What else?

160
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:39,390
I'm going to do replay the trick that the criminal did!

161
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,590
The criminal's...

162
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,890
Trick?

163
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:46,090
Yes. You strangled and killed Mr. Hatta in the darkness of the theatre

164
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,190
that was shoving the movie,

165
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:53,090
then you tried to prove your innocence by using the projector.

166
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:56,290
Mr. Furuhashi! That was your trick!

167
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,580
You tried to prove your innocence by using the projector.

168
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,380
Mr. Furuhashi! That was your trick!

169
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,880
Wait up, mister!

170
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,980
Mr. Furuhashi was with me

171
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,280
in the projection room when that man hung himself!

172
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,680
How would you know anything about what happened

173
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,680
when you weren't even here at that time?

174
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,280
I more or less have an idea of what happened

175
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,080
because I heard about it from this boy.

176
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,680
Right, Conan?

177
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,580
Yes!

178
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,080
That's why I'm telling you when the shadow appeared on the screen,

179
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,680
Mr. Furuhashi was with me in the projection room, understand?

180
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,280
Oh, do you mean like this?

181
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,680
Genta's head is on the screen!

182
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,980
Gosh! Where's the trick behind all this?

183
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,880
A child just hung himself in the midst of the movie being projected!

184
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,580
No!

185
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,680
Genta was hanging there for a while!

186
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,180
Right? -Yes!

187
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,580
Come on, don't lie.

188
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,780
If he was there from before,

189
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,880
we would've seen him when we looked at the window a while ago.

190
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,980
You didn't see him because the window was covered with this book.

191
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,680
And the light of the projection room was cut off.

192
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,380
In this way, it would've be difficult for anyone to see the corpse

193
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,380
even if it were to be hung beforehand, right?

194
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,580
But, Dr. Agasa...

195
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,680
According to everyone's testimony, the corpse was swaying.

196
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,980
A corpse that was hung beforehand couldn't have swung on its own.

197
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:49,380
All right, Genta, Mitsuhiko, Ayumi, you're on!

198
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,880
Okay!

199
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,480
Hey...

200
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,180
The three of them put together is just about the weight of one adult.

201
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,580
Just what are you trying to do?

202
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,580
All right, Ai, now!

203
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,280
Yes... I'll turn it on now.

204
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,680
The air conditioner...

205
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,280
This is...

206
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,980
It is a large vacuum space inside the theatre.

207
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,880
As long as the direction and strength of the wind is adjusted beforehand,

208
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,380
the corpse sway by circulating the air is possible.

209
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,380
The air coming out of the air conditioner

210
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,280
seems to have been stronger than usual today.

211
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,280
Right, owner?

212
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,680
Yes.

213
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,980
Hey, old man.

214
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,380
I understand how the corpse can be hung without anyone noticing

215
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,380
and how it was made to sway,

216
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,280
but don't you think you're forgetting something very important?

217
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,680
The movie was being projected from the window

218
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,580
that the kids are hanging in front of!

219
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,280
If they were hanging there to begin with,

220
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,580
their shadows would've appeared,

221
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,680
and if you were to cover the window with a book,

222
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,280
the movie wouldn't be projected.

223
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,980
How did I project the movie until that time...

224
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,180
You did it like this, right?

225
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,580
See? Like this!

226
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,980
Here you go!

227
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,980
No way.

228
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,280
How on earth?

229
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,680
Go like this and there!

230
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,980
It can't be, sir...

231
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,680
He cut the film into pieces

232
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,480
and used the two projector alternately.

233
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,680
I won't forgive him!

234
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,080
They are precious films that we have to return later, and yet!

235
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,280
Hey, that's enough!

236
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,880
Only the projector in the foreground is moving.

237
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,980
No film is set on this projector.

238
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,980
Then, how on earth was it done?

239
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,380
Go around to the front of the projector and take a good look.

240
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,080
This is...

241
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,780
a mirror!

242
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,980
Right.

243
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,880
This is a piece of the cracked mirror that was found in the room next door.

244
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,380
Twist it like so and the picture is reflected.

245
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,080
By using the reflection of the other piece of cracked mirror

246
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,780
that has been fixed on the window,

247
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,380
you can project the movie from the window

248
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,280
and avoid the corpse showing up.

249
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,080
In this way, you can switch windows

250
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,580
with just one projector without cutting the film into pieces.

251
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,780
Besides, just placed it here,

252
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,780
even if someone were to look through the door,

253
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,580
the mirror would be hidden from view because of the projector!

254
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:42,380
The cigarette butts that the late Mr. Hatta was smoking during the show

255
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,580
are all on the ground by the seat right before the peep hole window

256
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,280
is proof of that.

257
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,680
I've heard that he always sat in front of the window

258
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,180
where the movie was projected so that he could obstruct business.

259
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,080
Is that right, Mr. Furuhashi?

260
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,880
In other words, this is what you did, Mr. Furuhashi.

261
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,580
After asking Yuri to go out shopping for you,

262
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,880
committing the crime was easier for you

263
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,680
because the snack stand was empty.

264
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,880
You went to the air conditioning room as the movie started,

265
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,980
and adjusted the strength of air, as well as change the direction of it.

266
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,680
Of course, the picture was projected from the peep hole window,

267
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,480
by using the reflection of the mirror.

268
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,580
Then you went into the theatre

269
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,280
and strangled Mr. Hatta's neck

270
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,480
with the rope that you had ready beforehand.

271
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,380
All you had to do next was hang him in front of the window

272
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,380
where the movie was to be projected from!

273
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,280
Then you returned to the projection room

274
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,580
and waited for Yuri to come back,

275
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,380
removed the object that was blocking the window

276
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,680
where the movie is to be projected,

277
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,180
and remove the mirror from the lens of the projector.

278
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:56,380
Then, the shadow of the hung corpse would appear on the screen,

279
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,680
and if you see that together with Yuri,

280
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,480
you would have a perfect alibi!

281
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,580
But... but I went shopping

282
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,680
only because I forgot to buy the lunches I was supposed to buy.

283
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,080
Even if you didn't forget the lunches,

284
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:17,280
he was probably going to ask you to buy some tea leaves anyway.

285
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,680
He suggested the owner watch the movie today

286
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,780
because he wanted his testimony of which scene the shadow appeared.

287
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,180
And he probably chose to hang the corpse,

288
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,980
which requires a lot of strength

289
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,380
so that the owner wouldn't be suspected.

290
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:38,880
But... but you're only speculating!

291
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,480
Then please take a look

292
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,680
at the photos taken by Mr. Ide with his digital camera.

293
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,280
What?

294
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,880
Please show them the photo of the scene

295
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,880
when the shadow appears on the screen.

296
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,880
It... it is off focus.

297
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,980
Yes, the weak point of this trick is once the mirror is removed,

298
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,980
the distance from the projector and the screen changes,

299
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,980
and turns out blurred.

300
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,980
The projector now is equipped with lens that are adjusted to this theatre,

301
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,080
so it is correctly focused.

302
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,880
It'll naturally require some time to change the lens,

303
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,880
and while the lens is being changed, the picture will not be clear.

304
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,480
In other words, Mr. Furuhashi couldn't adjust the focus

305
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,580
until the lights went on.

306
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:36,180
But it is difficult to focus on some moving objects, isn't it?

307
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,380
No matter how much the picture is moving,

308
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,680
the frame of the picture wouldn't be unclear.

309
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,680
The seats are focused all right.

310
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,880
Oh, right.

311
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,980
When the shadow appeared and I looked through the window,

312
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,980
I touched the projector.

313
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,980
I'm sure that the projector moved at that time

314
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,380
and the picture blurred.

315
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:00,680
Then, why did you go to the restroom to fix your contact lens?

316
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,980
After taking the lunch to the projection room

317
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,880
and boiling water for tea,

318
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,180
why did you leave the room and go to the restroom?

319
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,180
That's because...

320
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,780
Because there was no mirror in the waiting room, right?

321
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,980
I'm sorry, Yuri.

322
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,280
That I made you worry.

323
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,480
Mr. Furuhashi.

324
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,580
Then, you're the one who did it after all?

325
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:35,180
Yes, I'm sorry to have troubled you.

326
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:41,180
But I didn't think you'll do something like this.

327
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:46,580
I thought you liked this theatre too.

328
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:53,780
Yes, I tried to keep myself from doing this.

329
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,880
But I just couldn't take it anymore.

330
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,180
Well,

331
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:06,980
I like looking outside very much from this peep hole.

332
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,680
I love this special seat where I could watch

333
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,380
every little response of the audience as they watched the movies.

334
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,080
But just because of that guy,

335
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,080
our customers started decreasing one after the other.

336
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,280
And despite yesterday being Sunday,

337
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,480
he was the only customer here.

338
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,480
That's why I hung him up here

339
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,580
and gave him a taste of his own medicine.

340
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:40,280
I wanted him to see this sad sight

341
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,680
and feel this desolate, lonesome feeling.

342
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,780
Well, there's no way he can feel it dead.

343
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,680
We'll hear the rest of the story at the station.

344
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,180
I'm really sorry, owner.

345
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,580
Because of my selfishness,

346
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,280
the last day of the theatre was imperfect.

347
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,980
It may have turned out this way sooner or later anyway.

348
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,180
What?

349
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,480
Even before that guy started coming here,

350
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,780
the number of customers were decreasing anyway.

351
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,480
Theatres like ours who cannot show new popular movies

352
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,880
have no choice but to go bankrupt.

353
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,880
Nowadays, when TVs and videos have become a part of daily life,

354
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,280
it may already be outdated to sell dreams by showing movies.

355
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,680
That's not true!

356
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,880
I love movies!

357
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,580
The screen is way bigger than TV too!

358
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,080
It's a dream space where we can share great emotions

359
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,880
with a large number of people!

360
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,780
Yes... the sound echoes throughout the entire theatre

361
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,680
and it feels like you're in the movie!

362
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,380
It's really exciting!

363
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,380
Yes! -I can watch as long as I like

364
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,380
without being scolded by my mom too!

365
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,080
The realism is different from TV!

366
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,080
Hey, old man.

367
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,380
If you know how to operate the projector,

368
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,580
please show them the show

369
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,380
as an apology for having made them feel bad.

370
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,480
Please show these little customers

371
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,280
the continuation of the show.

372
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,680
So, all five of us had the entire theatre to ourselves

373
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,380
and the showing of Gomera began.

374
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,280
Hey, Gomera! You got eyes or what?

375
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,680
Behind you...

376
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,680
Hurry, run!

377
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,180
There the best customers for the last show.

378
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,080
No.

379
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,880
I'm not going to make this the last.

380
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,680
I'm not selling this place.

381
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,080
I've almost forgotten

382
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,280
the overwhelming feeling I felt when I first saw the movies.

383
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:41,680
The feeling of euphoria that surrounded this space.

384
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,680
If I don't go through with this, I won't be able to die in peace.

385
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,680
I'm going to fill this audience

386
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,480
with children who are smiling like them.

387
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,580
Go for it!

388
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,380
Gomera!

389
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:59,880
But they sure can get worked up.
