1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,560
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,160
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,960
The case is full of mystery and love is a labyrinth.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,460
Officers have it tough, too.

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,160
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,060
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,260
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,370
When the branch manager of the bank that was robbed

9
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,170
comes to the police station for questioning,

10
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,270
his wife is murdered.

11
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,070
The murderer is definitely the branch manager.

12
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,070
But he had a perfect alibi of being at the police station

13
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,270
when the crime was committed!

14
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:03,320
"Detective Love Story (Part 2)"

15
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,170
Assistant Inspector Shiratori!

16
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,670
We checked the victim's room

17
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,470
and found her wallet and jewelry out in the open.

18
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,170
Therefore, the possibility of it having been a robbery is very little.

19
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,970
Just as I thought!

20
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,770
Start questioning the neighborhood

21
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,470
to see if there was anyone asking around

22
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,370
about this residence for the past two or three days.

23
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,470
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

24
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,170
And...

25
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,270
I'd like you to know that

26
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,370
I have become an inspector as of today.

27
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,970
Understand?

28
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,770
Yes, sir. I understand.

29
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,570
There is a large loophole in Inspector Shiratori's deduction.

30
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,170
I've got to let him know somehow.

31
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,870
Inspector Shiratori!

32
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,970
You go on home, sonny.

33
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,270
I'll ask someone to take you home.

34
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,770
Don't you think it's strange?

35
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,870
The killer killed her

36
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,770
because she was on the phone with the police, right?

37
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:05,370
Then, why did the killer have to put the shelves back?

38
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,070
It's obvious that the police will rush over here

39
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,770
after the scream is heard,

40
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,670
so there would be no time to waste.

41
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,470
Well...

42
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,570
That's true.

43
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,270
The bookshelf on the side is full of books

44
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,970
and nobody can hide inside.

45
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,470
Inspector Shiratori!

46
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,170
What is it?

47
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,370
I found a strange album in the victim's room.

48
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,570
Please take a look.

49
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,170
Strange circles are written in here and there on the pictures.

50
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,270
That's just some of my wife's doodlings!

51
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,470
I kept telling her to stop doing it

52
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,270
because it would soil the pictures

53
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:44,870
I see. That's why he killed his wife.

54
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,370
There's no doubt.

55
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,170
He's the killer.

56
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,270
But he has an alibi.

57
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,270
He has a perfect alibi of being at the police station

58
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,170
right before my very eyes.

59
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,870
There's got be something.

60
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,870
A way to kill a person

61
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,470
who is several kilometers away from the police station.

62
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,670
Inspector Shiratori.

63
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,470
It will be better to wait untill the special squad contacts us.

64
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,470
There are too many mysteries involved in this case.

65
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,670
I'd like to ask you then!

66
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,170
Who and where is the killer,

67
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,970
and how did he commit the murder?

68
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,770
It is an obvious fact that the killer snuck in here

69
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,470
and killed the victim.

70
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,070
Judging from the circumstances,

71
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,170
what other possibility can you think of

72
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,270
other than the killer ambushing her and killing her?

73
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,570
A knife couldn't have come flying on its own.

74
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,870
A knife come flying on its own?

75
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,270
Wait a second.

76
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,670
Maybe...

77
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,370
I've found it! This is it!

78
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,070
If so, it should be there.

79
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,670
If that is there...

80
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,270
-Hey! -Get down, sonny!

81
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,970
Huh? It's not here.

82
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,470
Strange... There are slight blood stains

83
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,670
on the bookshelf and the curtains,

84
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,570
and yet why is it not here?

85
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,370
There are splotches of blood?

86
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,270
I see. So, that's what it is.

87
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,170
I've got the entire picture.

88
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,070
I've figured out the trick you used

89
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,770
to kill your wife who was kilometers away from here.

90
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,870
Anyway, judging from the circumstances at the scene,

91
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,070
the fact that the killer snuck into this house

92
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,970
and stabbed the victim in the back with a knife

93
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:56,170
while she was on the phone is more than obvious.

94
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,970
And the killer is probably

95
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,970
one of the robbers who robbed the Tohto Bank the other day.

96
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,170
The motive is that when the victim was taken hostage,

97
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,270
she took note of his characteristic,

98
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,670
and he wanted to shut her up.

99
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,470
Moreover, the victim has told her husband

100
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,170
that the killer is a foreigner.

101
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,770
Well, although there are some unexplainable points,

102
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,070
I think that it'd be wiser for you

103
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,470
to inform the special squad in charge of the robbery about it.

104
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,370
All right. I'll call them, okay?

105
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:34,670
Officer Takagi, take this little one back to Mr. Mouri's house.

106
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,070
What are you doing?

107
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,270
I am folding origami.

108
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,870
Origami?

109
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,970
This is not a play room, sonny.

110
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,870
Do that at home.

111
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,870
I had something I wanted to ask you,

112
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,270
so I asked the investigation officer for paper

113
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,270
to make a knife.

114
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,370
What is it you want to ask, sonny?

115
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,170
When you stab something with a knife,

116
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,470
you hold it this way or this way, right?

117
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,870
That's right.

118
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,670
She was attacked from behind

119
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,870
when she was pedaling the aero-bike

120
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,870
and talking on the phone, right?

121
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,770
Yes, the victim has perspiration on her,

122
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,370
and the place that she is lying

123
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,670
as well as the place of the phone

124
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,070
are all near the aero-bike.

125
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,270
Besides, the victim is bare-footed.

126
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,770
Since there are no perspiration marks made by her feet,

127
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,070
nor signs of her body having moved at all.

128
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,970
So, it's most likely that she was stabbed

129
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,770
and fell here right on the spot.

130
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,070
Then, isn't it strange?

131
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:39,070
So, what's so strange?

132
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,770
The knife that stabbed her back.

133
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,170
See, it's stabbed sideways facing the corpse.

134
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,870
That's right!

135
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,670
If she was attacked from behind,

136
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,970
the knife should be facing vertically.

137
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,270
Right.

138
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,770
It's understandable if she was attacked from the side,

139
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:03,170
but it's strange that she couldn't see the killer coming at her

140
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,270
and didn't flee at all.

141
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,970
That's easy to answer.

142
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,270
The killer probably attacked the victim from behind

143
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,870
and pushed her down on the floor.

144
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,870
He put both his knees on top of the victim's neck and hip,

145
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,670
and killed her while pinning her down.

146
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,370
Just as expected of you, Inspector!

147
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,170
You're so smart!

148
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,770
It's no big deal.

149
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,770
But I think that's wrong.

150
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,770
Huh?

151
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,170
Because if you're pinned down to the floor,

152
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:36,970
you would normally struggle trying to get away, right?

153
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:40,170
But Officer Sato mentioned just a while ago

154
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:43,270
that there were no such perspiration stains on the floor.

155
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,370
Besides, I think that the phone lying on the floor like that

156
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,870
is strange, too.

157
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,270
Right.

158
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,670
After she screamed,

159
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,670
Officer Takagi kept calling her,

160
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,070
so I am sure the killer heard him.

161
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,470
If the killer knew that the one on the phone the police,

162
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:04,170
why didn't he switch the phone off?

163
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,270
With the phone turned on,

164
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,570
he risks a chance of leaving some kind of sound

165
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:11,270
that may lead to his arrest.

166
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,070
Well...

167
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,270
The killer panicked and fled with all his might.

168
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,670
The killer left behind the murder weapon knife,

169
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:24,670
which could after some investigation lead to his arrest, too.

170
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,170
But when we first got here,

171
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,570
the door to the living room was locked.

172
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,170
Why would a killer who is in a rush lock the door?

173
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:40,670
Besides, the window that the killer supposedly snuck in from

174
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,970
was also locked.

175
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,670
See, aren't you starting to feel

176
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,870
that something is not right too, Inspector?

177
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:58,770
It's just as if no one else but the victim was here to begin with.

178
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,170
It's very strange.

179
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,360
You're right, sonny.

180
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,060
We need to check this room a little more carefully.

181
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:19,660
So, are you saying that a knife came flying on its own

182
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,060
towards the victim who was alone in this room?

183
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,360
Besides, if there were to be such an equipment,

184
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,660
you guys who found the corpse would have found it.

185
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,960
Huh?

186
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,760
What's this string?

187
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,960
String?

188
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,960
What are you talking about?

189
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,460
Look.

190
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,860
There's string tangled onto it inside.

191
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,960
Right?

192
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,860
Oh, I see. It's there.

193
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,560
Do you know what that string is there for?

194
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,160
I wonder.

195
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,360
Well, some string for packing or something

196
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,060
must have gotten tangle onto it.

197
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,760
But look at the end of this string.

198
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,260
See, there's a little circle made on it.

199
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,460
Here.

200
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,860
Oh, really.

201
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,460
This sure doesn't look like a string for packing.

202
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,060
Now I remember!

203
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,460
Some children of my friend came to spend the night here

204
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,960
about six months ago.

205
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,860
They seem to have been playing around the aero-bike then,

206
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,660
so they may have done it.

207
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,960
But...

208
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,960
It's a waste of time thinking about it.

209
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,960
Just what can you do with a string like that?

210
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,460
Wait a minute please!

211
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,360
Maybe, maybe...

212
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,760
On the top of the bookshelf behind,

213
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,660
a knife was fixed on using masking tape or something.

214
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,760
Then, if the string is hooked on to the edge of the curtain rail,

215
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,960
the string would wind just by the victim pedaling the aero-bike.

216
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,660
The bookshelf would fall,

217
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:02,160
and the knife would automatically stab the victim in the back!

218
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,860
That's a very interesting deduction,

219
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,060
but can you actually stab someone in that manner?

220
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,560
That plan could easily go wrong.

221
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,960
But the possibility of the knife stabbing the victim is more likely.

222
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,660
Beside that bookshelf

223
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,960
is another bookshelf that is packed with books,

224
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,560
so it'll fall where it's supposed to.

225
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,460
The victim who was the target

226
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,760
would obviously be on the aero-bike.

227
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,060
Moreover, the bookshelf will come falling

228
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,560
from an angle that is a blind spot for the victim.

229
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,260
But if the pedal suddenly gets heavy,

230
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,160
wouldn't the victim realize that something is wrong?

231
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,960
Oh, don't you know?

232
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,360
Aero-bikes are set so that they gradually get heavier.

233
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,660
If this was a routine for the victim,

234
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,260
she probably wouldn't have noticed a thing.

235
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,160
But...

236
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,260
the bookshelf wasn't tipped over

237
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,260
when you found the corpse, was it?

238
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,060
Besides, if the killer were to come in here

239
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,960
and set up such thing,

240
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,460
it'd be much easier for him to just come in here

241
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,860
and kill her.

242
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,460
There is just one person

243
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,260
who can restore the bookshelf to it's original place

244
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,260
and needed to use this trick.

245
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,060
That person is someone who knows the layout of this room

246
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,960
and is aware of the habits of the victim.

247
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,560
He is the one who entered this room before anyone else,

248
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
the husband of the victim.

249
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,560
That person is you, Mr. Keizo Masuo!

250
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,060
What the...

251
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,260
I see.

252
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,760
That's why you made that phone call from the police.

253
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,060
Knowing that your wife exercises using the aero-bike

254
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,660
at 2:00 everyday,

255
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,960
you would more or less have an idea

256
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,160
of when the knife would stab her.

257
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,660
There wouldn't be a better alibi

258
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,460
if your wife were to be stabbed while you are on the phone

259
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,760
talking to her in front of our very eyes.

260
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,360
You gave Officer Takagi the phone

261
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,560
in the the middle of the conversation,

262
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,660
just so that he could confirm that it was your wife.

263
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,860
Besides, when we arrived,

264
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,260
you told us to go look upstairs.

265
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,760
I see.

266
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,960
You picked the bookshelf up

267
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,260
and put it back in place while we were upstairs.

268
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,260
Wait, don't be ridiculous!

269
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,660
If there were many officers then,

270
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:22,360
I'm sure someone came into this room earlier than I did!

271
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:28,960
If so, they would have seen the knife and the bookself.

272
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,760
This is how you probably did it, right?

273
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,860
Huh?

274
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,560
See, if you fill just the very top of the bookshelf

275
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,460
with books and poke the knife into the space here,

276
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,160
you wouldn't need masking tape

277
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,060
to fix the knife in place, would you?

278
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,960
It'll fall easier too if the top is heavy.

279
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,360
I see!

280
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,160
If so, after the knife stabs the victim,

281
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,360
the books would slide down,

282
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,060
and the victim would fall to the floor

283
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,760
with the knife still poked inside her.

284
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,460
All he has to do after that is put the bookshelf back

285
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,260
and pick up the books that are scattered,

286
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,760
so no one realizes that anything had been rigged.

287
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,360
But, sonny,

288
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,760
if there were to be a knife sticking out of the bookshelf,

289
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,760
my wife would have noticed it.

290
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,260
All right, then.

291
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,860
There! What if it's placed like this?

292
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,960
What the...

293
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,360
I see!

294
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,460
That way the knife would be hidden

295
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,160
and it explains why the knife had stabbed the victim from the side.

296
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,060
You're really something, sonny.

297
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,260
Besides, even if the officers were to get here before the killer

298
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,060
and see the tilted bookshelf and scattered books,

299
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,960
it would just look like the victim had struggled with the killer

300
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,260
and it wouldn't even dawn on anyone

301
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,460
that there had ever been something rigged here.

302
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,060
Well, how about it, Mr. Masuo?

303
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,260
The string would still be stuck to the curtain rail,

304
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,760
and it would be so obvious that you've have noticed right away.

305
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,660
And where's the proof that I'm the one who did this?

306
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,460
What's the matter?

307
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,160
It seems you poked your finger with something and got hurt.

308
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,860
Oh, I get it!

309
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,760
When you put your handkerchief back in your pocket a while ago,

310
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,660
you seemed to be in pain, right?

311
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,960
You've got something in your pocket, don't you?

312
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,660
Won't you please show it to us?

313
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,960
The contents in his pocket

314
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,360
is probably a thumbtack or something stuck onto a tape

315
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,660
with the blood stain of the on it.

316
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,060
Oh, how do you know?

317
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,160
Just by looking at the slight snatches of blood stains

318
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,060
that are that are splattered on the bookshelf.

319
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,660
It is obvious that something had been stuck on here.

320
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,060
You adjusted the direction of the thumbtack

321
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,960
and stuck it on to the bookshelf.

322
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,260
Then, you hooked the loop of the string on,

323
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,160
so that when the bookshelf falls, it'll come off easily.

324
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,360
The string that comes off then is wound up

325
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,660
by the inertia of the pedal of the aero-bike spinning.

326
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,960
But how was he going to justify himself

327
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,260
He was probably going to say that his wife

328
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,660
used the thumbtack to hook this on behind,

329
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,260
and that she poked her finger accidentally.

330
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:13,160
Therefore, the blood stain being there is just a coincidence.

331
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,760
Shall we try it out to see if it'll really work?

332
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,560
Let's stick that thing that you have

333
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,260
in your pocket onto the bookshelf.

334
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,060
It will work, so don't bother trying.

335
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,560
Because I tried several hundred times last night

336
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,960
and perfected the angle of the thumbtack.

337
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,960
I just wanted to be safe and peeled it off

338
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,060
when I placed the bookshelf back up.

339
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,060
But to think that in turn worked against me...

340
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,260
Why did you kill your wife?

341
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,460
Insurance money.

342
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,260
My wife was covered by a very expensive life insurance.

343
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,760
That's why I made it look like a killing committed

344
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,360
by the bank robber and killed her.

345
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,660
It's good that you're considerate towards your friend,

346
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,360
but everything will come out in the open in no time.

347
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,060
That is, you made your friends rob your own bank!

348
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,060
Really?

349
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,760
Yes. And he's probably the leader of the band!

350
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,460
The boss is the branch manager of the bank,

351
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,760
so of course the robbery wouldn't face any troubles.

352
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,560
But it was really unfortunate

353
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,960
that your friends mistakenly took your wife

354
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,760
who happened to walk into the bank as hostage.

355
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:35,060
Your wife realized he was your friend based on his voice

356
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,560
and she was getting ready to tell the police about that,

357
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,660
so you killed her to shut her up.

358
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,460
Then, the robber didn't change hostages back then

359
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,060
because she put up too much of fight...

360
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,060
But because she was the boss's wife.

361
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,060
How did you figure all that out?

362
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,960
Remember the album with strange circles around the pictures?

363
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,060
Mrs. Masuo was probably planning to bring that to the police.

364
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:04,160
And inform us that the bank robbers were those people.

365
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,660
And besides, that boy has been standing there

366
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,760
while holding the album open all this time.

367
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,660
Two hours later,

368
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,360
the two robbers who were at their condo counting cash

369
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,960
were arrested.

370
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,660
Thus, two cases were solved at once.

371
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,960
According to Mr. Masuo's testimony,

372
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,160
he says he robbed the bank for his extravagant,

373
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,860
money-spending wife.

374
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,660
How ironic that he would end up killing his wife.

375
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,860
Hey, I heard you seem to have already performed some feat

376
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,260
the minute you were promoted inspector!

377
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,360
Just as expected of you!

378
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,260
It was no big deal, Superintendent Matsumoto.

379
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,460
Such simple case hardly require my attention.

380
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,160
That's right. Because the case was solved...

381
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,460
Thanks to this little one here!

382
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,360
Huh? Aren't you the boy staying at Mr. Mouri's place?

383
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,260
He was really fantastic, finding one hint after another!

384
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,460
It was all coincidence.

385
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,860
I bet like they say,

386
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:53,560
little children can solve puzzle rings faster than adults.

387
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,960
Oh, no.

388
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,660
It's this late already?

389
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,560
No wonder I am so hungry.

390
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,760
Officer Sato.

391
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,260
If it's okay with you, will you join me...

392
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,260
Why don't you join me for dinner?

393
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,760
Why don't we enjoy the night scenery over a drink?

394
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,560
Right, I have a French restaurant in mind.

395
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,760
Oh, how nice.

396
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,560
Just as I thought.

397
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,260
It's just as I thought.

398
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,160
My uncle happens to be a chef at a three star restaurant.

399
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,060
That's amazing!

400
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,760
But no thanks.

401
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,260
I don't really care for French food.

402
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,460
Oh, what a shame.

403
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,660
Then, maybe some other time.

404
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,760
Officer Sato, you don't like French food?

405
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,560
I have no likes or dislikes.

406
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,760
I just don't like expensive restaurants

407
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,860
where I have to get all stiff.

408
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,360
What do you say

409
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,360
about going to a good noodle shop that I found nearby?

410
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,660
Yes! It will be my pleasure!

411
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,560
Officer Sato and Officer Takagi!

412
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,660
How about it?

413
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,960
Would you like to go for a drink to celebrate solving the case?

414
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,860
The others are already gathered at the pub!

415
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:16,660
Yes, sir! Miwako Sato will accept your kindly offer!

416
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,260
Don't tell me that the one Officer Sato likes is...

417
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,960
Come on, Let's go, Officer Takagi!

418
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,960
No, I've still got work left to do.

419
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,860
When are you going to start questioning us?

420
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,660
It's already 8:00 pm.

421
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,260
I'm going to forget everything,

422
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,960
since it so way back in the past!

423
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,860
He is a hopeless case.
