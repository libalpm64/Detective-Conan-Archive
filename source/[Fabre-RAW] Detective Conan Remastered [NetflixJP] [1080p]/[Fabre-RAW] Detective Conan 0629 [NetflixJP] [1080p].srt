1
00:00:07,325 --> 00:00:09,725
The wind feels good.

2
00:00:09,725 --> 00:00:11,425
Really!

3
00:00:11,425 --> 00:00:13,993
There are many super pretty fish near the isolated island

4
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:17,725
that we're headed for now!

5
00:00:17,725 --> 00:00:19,999
I feel really excited.

6
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:22,025
Ai should've come too.

7
00:00:22,025 --> 00:00:24,003
She said she didn't want to get a sun tan.

8
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,525
Conan, a seagull!

9
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:31,325
The seagull's over that side.

10
00:00:31,325 --> 00:00:33,125
More than that,

11
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:36,015
doesn't it look like it's going to rain?

12
00:00:41,525 --> 00:00:43,625
Like the fog clears.

13
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,825
Let's see through love and crime as well.

14
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:47,425
A tragedy occurs on an isolated island.

15
00:00:47,425 --> 00:00:49,425
A fight that breaks out among the video crew.

16
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:51,025
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:00:51,025 --> 00:00:52,825
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:00:52,825 --> 00:00:55,225
His name is Detective Conan.

19
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,141
"Promotion Video Filming (Part 1)"

20
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,679
Mr. Kurahashi, thank you for having us over again.

21
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:58,157
Sonoko, thank you for always

22
00:02:58,157 --> 00:03:00,879
-patronizing our pension. -Thank you.

23
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,479
Okay, let's hurry and put our things in our room

24
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,479
and go snorkelling!

25
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:08,779
"Osamu Kurohashi (43)" -Oh, a storm is coming this way now.

26
00:03:08,779 --> 00:03:11,679
I'm sorry to say this after you've come this far,

27
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:14,479
but please don't go into the water because it's dangerous.

28
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,079
-What? -Are you serious?

29
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:21,079
How disappointing.

30
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:24,579
I wanted to see pretty fish.

31
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:28,187
Well, I thought it was going to turn out this way.

32
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:30,579
"Keiko Kurahashi (38)" -Let me show you

33
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:32,679
to your rooms, everyone!

34
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:39,079
No joke.

35
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:41,479
I was looking forward to it and yet.

36
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:45,579
Come to think of it, it's typhoon season right now.

37
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,979
What's the matter, Conan?

38
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,879
They seem to be filming something over there.

39
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,379
Filming?

40
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:54,213
Hey, Okita,

41
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:56,215
make sure you shine the light on me.

42
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:57,679
Yes, sir.

43
00:03:57,679 --> 00:04:01,479
"Yuya Miyasaka (30)" -Right, right. That's good.

44
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:05,179
Hey, hey! Isn't that Yuya Miyasaka?

45
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:07,579
Who? Is he famous?

46
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:08,979
He's an actor.

47
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:10,579
You see, the one who got drunk

48
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:13,179
and was arrested for assault last year.

49
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:14,879
I remember.

50
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,679
And because of that the drama he was starring in was called off.

51
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:21,979
I also used to like that drama so I remember it too.

52
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:23,979
Ever since then, his popularity went down the drain

53
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:26,679
and he disappeared from TV.

54
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:29,279
But, I wonder what he's filming in a place like this?

55
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,179
It looks sort of interesting.

56
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:33,579
Let's go check it out.

57
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:35,179
-Okay. -Hey, hey.

58
00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:38,879
"Saeko Akimoto (25)"

59
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:45,379
Oh. Actress Saeko Akimoto is there too.

60
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:46,779
Actress?

61
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:49,779
Where?

62
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,579
Cut!

63
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:59,379
All right. Okay.

64
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:03,379
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:04,283
It's okay.

66
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,679
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:10,079
We're staying over at a pension nearby,

68
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,079
and came to see what you were shooting.

69
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,479
"Miki Kitagawa (22)" -Then, I'm sure you're staying

70
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,479
at the same pension we are.

71
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:19,779
What are you shooting now?

72
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:24,303
We're shooting a promotion video of Yuya Miyasaka.

73
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:27,479
What's the content about?

74
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:31,379
Well, the two, Saeko and Mr. Miyasaka drift onto an isolated island,

75
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:33,279
but with his superb survival skills

76
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,879
he protects her from danger.

77
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:38,079
The story goes like so.

78
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:40,319
An uninhabited island.

79
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:46,325
I'm counting on you, then.

80
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:48,327
Yes, sir.

81
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:49,979
Hey, Miki.

82
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:51,479
He's calling me.

83
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:52,679
See you.

84
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:59,879
Who are those guys?

85
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:03,179
People who are staying at the same pension as we are.

86
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,079
Huh?

87
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,879
Oh, that great actress is putting on her own make-up.

88
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:10,679
Um, wasn't that person who was here a while ago

89
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:12,979
the make-up artist?

90
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:18,357
Don't... Saeko is watching.

91
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,079
Who cares?

92
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,879
Let's get on with the shooting.

93
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:29,779
I see, so that's the story.

94
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:31,979
What do you mean?

95
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:37,179
Yuya Miyasaka and Saeko Akimoto were once rumored about.

96
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:40,679
However, another woman showed up.

97
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:46,979
I mean, she can hear.

98
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,679
Next, scene 14!

99
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:55,279
It's the scene where I slide down the cliff

100
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,479
to try and save Saeko who is below the cliff.

101
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:59,279
Hey, Yamamoto!

102
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,579
Are ready over there?

103
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:04,879
"Eiji Yamamoto (21), Assistant Director" -Yes, sir. We're ready.

104
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,779
Hold it.

105
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:09,179
"Mitsuo Okita (23), Camera Assistant" -Mr. Miyasaka, what is this?

106
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,979
I didn't hear anything about me doing stunts!

107
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:14,679
But, you used to be in the exercise club

108
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:16,979
and have good athletic skills, don't you?

109
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,079
If you didn't,

110
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:21,179
I wouldn't have hired you as an assistant cameraman.

111
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:22,979
"Shingo Takayama (28), Cameraman" -Well, you can quit if you want to,

112
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:26,425
but I'm not paying you a cent, get that!

113
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:31,079
Darn, how dare he take unfair advantage of me?

114
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:33,579
You'd better make your mind up and resign yourself.

115
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:35,979
Once Mr. Miyasaka makes up his mind, he won't take no for an answer.

116
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:37,479
I know!

117
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:41,379
It's easy for you to say because it doesn't concern you!

118
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:49,579
Hey, is he really going to slide down from there?

119
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:51,679
No matter how good you are, that's impossible.

120
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,779
How frightening.

121
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:55,079
No matter how athletic.

122
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,379
This is going too far.

123
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,459
Ready,

124
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:02,461
action!

125
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:23,379
Cut!

126
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:26,485
Hey, Okita, are you okay?

127
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,495
I mean somehow the way you fell didn't have much impact.

128
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:38,497
Okita, do it once more!

129
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,779
What's with that look of yours?

130
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:46,979
I think it's better to cut it out already!

131
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:48,507
Exactly, right!

132
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:49,479
What?

133
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:51,679
Weren't you watching, Mr. Miyasaka?

134
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,879
He was one step before getting seriously hurt, you know!

135
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,879
-Right! -That's right!

136
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:59,979
You guys have no business in this!

137
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,527
That hurts!

138
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:11,579
Who threw the coke can over here?

139
00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:13,279
Oh, no.

140
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,279
Not you again, Genta.

141
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:22,079
There's a coke stain on it.

142
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:23,879
Oh, no.

143
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,545
Idiot!

144
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:32,579
Getting precious small props dirty!

145
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:34,579
Oh, come on, cool it.

146
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:37,079
Are you all right, Mr. Yamamoto?

147
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:41,579
You dupes.

148
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:45,479
Shoots. It's started to rain.

149
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:49,579
Mr. Miyasaka. It seems that even the heavens have forsaken you.

150
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:51,879
With all that's happening to you, this is more like a joke.

151
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,079
Shut up!

152
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:56,079
Everybody, we're going back to the pension.

153
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,579
Come, wipe your body with this.

154
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:10,879
The bath's ready too, so whenever you're ready,

155
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,591
please help yourselves.

156
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:14,593
How about it, everyone?

157
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:16,279
While dinner's being prepared,

158
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:20,599
would you like to do some recreation to get to know each other.

159
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:22,979
Okay!

160
00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:24,603
That sounds like fun.

161
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:25,579
Yeah!

162
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:27,179
You gotta be joking.

163
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:30,379
I mean we're not on some school excursion you now.

164
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,879
Give me a break.

165
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:33,479
Most owners of pensions

166
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:37,579
have a tendency to want their guests to get friendly with each other.

167
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:41,179
We've got to do some check on our equipment too.

168
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:42,621
If you will excuse us.

169
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:50,629
I'll go first!

170
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:52,631
The eight of spades.

171
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:54,279
Well...

172
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,079
Eight of diamonds.

173
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,637
I...

174
00:10:58,637 --> 00:11:00,979
Here, six of hearts.

175
00:11:00,979 --> 00:11:04,643
Is Mr. Miyasaka always like that?

176
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:06,379
I heard that he got in trouble

177
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:09,479
in some kind of incident before in the past too.

178
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:14,653
Mr. Miyasaka is trying desperately to regain the popularity he lost

179
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:16,179
due to that incident.

180
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:17,979
He's paying out of his own pocket for this promotion video

181
00:11:17,979 --> 00:11:20,079
that we're shooting now too.

182
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,679
He's staking everything he's got on this piece of work.

183
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:25,079
That's why he's nervous.

184
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:28,667
I'm sorry that we made you feel unpleasant.

185
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,669
It's okay.

186
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:40,379
Who is it?

187
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:42,681
It's me.

188
00:11:44,979 --> 00:11:46,379
Oh, what?

189
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:47,779
You haven't changed clothes yet?

190
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:51,279
Who cares! What do you want?

191
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,479
Won't you drink with me before dinner?

192
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:55,979
With this weather.

193
00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:59,379
I'm sure there'll be no more shooting today, right?

194
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,709
He punched me again.

195
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,079
Darn!

196
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,779
Darn, Miyasaka. How dare he...

197
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:23,079
Hey, Okita!

198
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:24,279
Yes, sir?

199
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,479
What is it, Mr. Takayama?

200
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:30,379
Miyasaka says to bring the camera to his room and roll it

201
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:33,279
because he wants to make a "making of" video.

202
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,735
I'm rolling the camera? Not you, Mr. Takayama?

203
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,479
Yeah. He's asking for you.

204
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:40,739
Maybe he wants to apologize for what

205
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:42,279
he did you to a while ago or something.

206
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,879
Here you go.

207
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:54,753
Pass 2 for me.

208
00:12:54,979 --> 00:12:56,755
Pass 3.

209
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:58,757
I can't make any more passes.

210
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:00,759
Pass 3

211
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:01,879
for me too.

212
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:05,679
Gee, Conan, it's not fair for you to stop everything!

213
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,779
Unfair?

214
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:09,679
I mean that's how this game seven is played, isn't it?

215
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:13,079
Bad news!

216
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:14,773
Mr. Miyasaka is

217
00:13:14,979 --> 00:13:16,775
dead!

218
00:13:27,604 --> 00:13:30,789
What do you mean, Mr. Miyasaka is dead?

219
00:13:31,004 --> 00:13:34,104
I was told to go to Miyasaka's room

220
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,704
because he wanted to shoot a making of film

221
00:13:35,704 --> 00:13:37,404
and wanted me to roll the camera.

222
00:13:37,404 --> 00:13:39,404
Then...

223
00:13:45,104 --> 00:13:47,304
What's wrong?

224
00:13:47,304 --> 00:13:50,504
Oh, Mr. Takayama, Mr. Miyasaka is...

225
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:53,704
Miyasaka!

226
00:13:53,704 --> 00:13:55,304
No joke?

227
00:13:55,304 --> 00:13:57,304
Okita! Call everyone here right away!

228
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:58,817
Yes, sir!

229
00:14:01,404 --> 00:14:02,821
Really?

230
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:04,304
Yes!

231
00:14:04,304 --> 00:14:05,904
No!

232
00:14:05,904 --> 00:14:07,804
Let's hurry over!

233
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:15,304
You people wait outside.

234
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:22,504
Mr. Takayama, is Mr. Miyasaka really...

235
00:14:22,504 --> 00:14:26,504
There's no pulse. It's too late.

236
00:14:26,504 --> 00:14:27,904
Mr. Miyasaka?

237
00:14:27,904 --> 00:14:28,847
No.

238
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:30,604
No!

239
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,904
What's the matter?

240
00:14:33,904 --> 00:14:35,404
What's going on?

241
00:14:36,404 --> 00:14:38,857
Miyasaka...

242
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:42,004
One stab of the knife through his chest.

243
00:14:44,863 --> 00:14:47,304
-Somehting's wrong. -Conan.

244
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,204
Don't go inside.

245
00:14:49,204 --> 00:14:51,904
I'm sorry.

246
00:14:53,404 --> 00:14:54,873
What's this?

247
00:14:56,304 --> 00:14:59,304
That's my liquid foundation.

248
00:14:59,304 --> 00:15:00,879
Why is it in a place like this?

249
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,804
Don't touch it!

250
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:05,704
We've got to keep the site intact.

251
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:08,887
Let's leave this room as is, and seal it off.

252
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:12,204
When the police come, I'll use the master key and open the room.

253
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:13,904
The police.

254
00:15:13,904 --> 00:15:15,604
A person has died.

255
00:15:15,604 --> 00:15:18,104
I've got to call the police, don't I?

256
00:15:18,104 --> 00:15:21,304
That's true, but...

257
00:15:24,204 --> 00:15:27,204
Miki, I think you should go to your room and rest.

258
00:15:27,204 --> 00:15:29,304
True.

259
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:30,604
Yes, thank you.

260
00:15:30,604 --> 00:15:33,204
Excuse me...

261
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:39,904
I called the police

262
00:15:39,904 --> 00:15:41,604
but was told that unless the storm subsides,

263
00:15:41,604 --> 00:15:43,804
they can't send any boats out.

264
00:15:43,804 --> 00:15:46,925
It means that the culprit is among us, doesn't it?

265
00:15:51,304 --> 00:15:53,504
Right?

266
00:15:53,504 --> 00:15:56,935
Because it's storming outside and even the police can't come here.

267
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:58,204
It's hard to think that someone from outside

268
00:15:58,204 --> 00:15:59,904
committed the crime, isn't it?

269
00:15:59,904 --> 00:16:03,804
I don't want to admit it, but I think so too.

270
00:16:03,804 --> 00:16:06,204
Oh, no.

271
00:16:07,404 --> 00:16:10,504
Uh... what shall we do about dinner?

272
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:11,704
I'm sorry to say

273
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,953
that we'll just have to let everyone wait until the police arrive.

274
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:16,404
I don't mind.

275
00:16:16,404 --> 00:16:20,490
Because I don't want to eat dinner together with a murderer.

276
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,904
You sound as if you're not the killer.

277
00:16:23,904 --> 00:16:24,963
What's with you?

278
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:26,504
Are you suspecting me?

279
00:16:26,504 --> 00:16:28,604
Well...

280
00:16:28,604 --> 00:16:32,504
Let's calm down and organize the circumstances together.

281
00:16:35,804 --> 00:16:38,977
Miki, are you alright already?

282
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:40,979
Yes, I am.

283
00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:44,404
I'm sorry to have worried you.

284
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,404
So, everyone's here.

285
00:16:46,404 --> 00:16:50,204
Miki, please come here.

286
00:16:50,204 --> 00:16:51,304
Thank you.

287
00:16:51,304 --> 00:16:54,504
Then first, about time that the murder was committed.

288
00:16:54,504 --> 00:16:57,004
It was probably between the time that Mr. Miyasaka left the lobby to

289
00:16:57,004 --> 00:17:01,804
when he was found dead by Mr. Okita.

290
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:05,904
All during that time we were in the lobby right through.

291
00:17:05,904 --> 00:17:09,604
In other words, me, Ran, Miki, Mr. Kurahashi

292
00:17:09,604 --> 00:17:13,011
and the four kids have an alibi.

293
00:17:13,204 --> 00:17:16,604
I see. The ones with no alibi are...

294
00:17:16,604 --> 00:17:20,104
actress, Saeko. Cameraman, Mr. Takayama,

295
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:23,504
AD, Mr. Yamamoto, his assistant, Mr. Okita,

296
00:17:23,504 --> 00:17:26,604
and my wife.

297
00:17:26,604 --> 00:17:30,004
I was getting dinner ready all the while!

298
00:17:30,004 --> 00:17:33,904
Yeah, there's no way you could be the culprit.

299
00:17:33,904 --> 00:17:36,504
You met Mr. Miyasaka for the first time today.

300
00:17:36,504 --> 00:17:38,604
So you have no motive.

301
00:17:39,704 --> 00:17:44,504
Which means, that one of the four among us is the culprit?

302
00:17:44,504 --> 00:17:48,304
As record of evidence, I'm going to start rolling the camera from here.

303
00:17:48,304 --> 00:17:51,604
So, who wants to start justifying themselves?

304
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,504
Uh, may I ask a question?

305
00:17:55,504 --> 00:17:57,055
Hey, Conan.

306
00:17:57,304 --> 00:17:59,604
All I want to do is ask a question.

307
00:17:59,604 --> 00:18:02,204
I'd like to ask you, Mr. Okita, but...

308
00:18:02,204 --> 00:18:05,063
Mr. Miyasaka's room is auto lock, isn't it?

309
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:07,065
How'd you get into the room?

310
00:18:07,304 --> 00:18:09,067
Was the door open?

311
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:11,604
In other words, when Okita went to the room,

312
00:18:11,604 --> 00:18:13,704
Miyasaka was still alive.

313
00:18:13,704 --> 00:18:15,504
Then after you, you know what, Miyasaka,

314
00:18:15,504 --> 00:18:18,404
you pretended to be the first one to find his body.

315
00:18:18,404 --> 00:18:21,079
You were pissed at Miyasaka about having to do the stunts,

316
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:23,081
so it's a possibility...

317
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:25,904
Hey, hold it.

318
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,904
When I got there...

319
00:18:27,904 --> 00:18:30,204
a bottle of cosmetic was stuck by the door

320
00:18:30,204 --> 00:18:33,091
and there was a space open!

321
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:35,804
It was Saeko's, wasn't it?

322
00:18:35,804 --> 00:18:39,404
Doesn't that mean she went to Miyasaka's room?

323
00:18:39,404 --> 00:18:42,904
Hey! You're suspecting me too?

324
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:46,404
Why would I have to do something like that in the first place?

325
00:18:46,404 --> 00:18:48,604
You've got motive!

326
00:18:49,604 --> 00:18:53,111
Saeko suspected that Miyasaka and I had an affair

327
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:54,704
and was jealous about it.

328
00:18:54,704 --> 00:18:58,304
Love entanglement?

329
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:03,121
If you wanted to go that far, I'll tell you honestly.

330
00:19:04,204 --> 00:19:07,125
It's true that I went to Mr. Miyasaka's room

331
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,004
in order to ask him about his relationship with Miki.

332
00:19:10,004 --> 00:19:12,104
But...

333
00:19:12,104 --> 00:19:16,004
Sorry, I just don't feel up to it now.

334
00:19:17,604 --> 00:19:21,404
He didn't let me into his room and I was shooed away.

335
00:19:21,404 --> 00:19:25,143
But, I didn't take foundation with me.

336
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:28,204
And yet, I myself don't know

337
00:19:28,204 --> 00:19:30,804
why it was at Miyasaka's room.

338
00:19:30,804 --> 00:19:35,153
There's something I'd like to ask you too, Mr. Takayama.

339
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:36,404
What is it?

340
00:19:36,404 --> 00:19:39,804
When I found Mr. Miyasaka's dead body,

341
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:42,204
you arrived there really quickly, didn't you?

342
00:19:42,204 --> 00:19:46,604
Almost as if you were waiting for me to burst out of the room.

343
00:19:46,604 --> 00:19:49,504
It could be that you lied about Mr. Miyasaka calling me,

344
00:19:49,504 --> 00:19:52,004
and you're the real culprit, Mr. Takayama.

345
00:19:52,004 --> 00:19:55,173
Weren't you trying to frame me up as the killer?

346
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:56,204
What?

347
00:19:56,204 --> 00:19:58,204
I know that

348
00:19:58,204 --> 00:20:00,104
Mr. Takayama owed a lot of money to Mr. Miyasaka

349
00:20:00,104 --> 00:20:03,181
from gambling playing mah-jong.

350
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:04,904
You idiot!

351
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,185
I went to check you out

352
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:09,204
because I was worried whether you could shoot the video alright!

353
00:20:09,204 --> 00:20:11,604
My debts had nothing to do with it!

354
00:20:11,604 --> 00:20:13,191
I wonder about that...

355
00:20:13,404 --> 00:20:16,604
How about you, Mr. Yamamoto?

356
00:20:16,604 --> 00:20:18,604
The murder weapon was the knife

357
00:20:18,604 --> 00:20:22,904
that was among your small props, wasn't it?

358
00:20:22,904 --> 00:20:27,504
I'll bet you were outraged at being punched by Miyasaka and did it?

359
00:20:27,504 --> 00:20:30,704
You were being slaved driven all the way up to now too.

360
00:20:30,704 --> 00:20:33,704
So, maybe all that accumulated to hate and...

361
00:20:33,704 --> 00:20:36,504
No, I didn't do it!

362
00:20:36,504 --> 00:20:40,904
I lost that knife when Mr. Miyasaka punched me!

363
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:46,904
I went to look for it right away,

364
00:20:46,904 --> 00:20:48,704
but it suddenly began raining so hard.

365
00:20:49,704 --> 00:20:52,704
I just couldn't find it.

366
00:20:52,704 --> 00:20:54,204
Really?

367
00:20:54,204 --> 00:20:56,104
What was it?

368
00:20:56,104 --> 00:21:00,104
The uncomfortable feeling I felt when I saw Mr. Miyasaka's dead body.

369
00:21:00,104 --> 00:21:01,239
Something...

370
00:21:01,404 --> 00:21:03,904
Something's not right.

371
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:06,704
Mr. Okita,

372
00:21:06,704 --> 00:21:09,804
if I remember correctly, the video camera was rolling

373
00:21:09,804 --> 00:21:11,704
when we went to Mr. Miyasaka's room, wasn't it?

374
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:13,251
Yeah.

375
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:17,255
I kept it rolling from the time we went to Mr. Miyasaka's room.

376
00:21:17,504 --> 00:21:22,004
That means that everything from the time

377
00:21:22,004 --> 00:21:24,404
that Mr. Miyasaka's dead body was found is recorded, right?

378
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:29,804
I just thought that if we watched that, you could come up with some clue.

379
00:21:29,804 --> 00:21:33,271
I'm sorry! I can't take it.

380
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:35,904
Not the video of Mr. Miyasaka's dead body.

381
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:42,704
Conan, Miki is really shocked over Mr. Miyasaka's death,

382
00:21:42,704 --> 00:21:43,704
you know?

383
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:47,004
Yep. I'm sorry.

384
00:21:47,004 --> 00:21:51,904
Who on earth could've killed Mr. Miyasaka?

385
00:21:53,504 --> 00:21:57,304
Mr. Takayama owed a lot of money to Mr. Miyasaka.

386
00:21:57,304 --> 00:21:59,004
It's possible to think that after he killed Mr. Miyasaka,

387
00:21:59,004 --> 00:22:01,299
he made Mr. Okita go to Mr. Miyasaka's room

388
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:04,804
and tried to set him up as the culprit.

389
00:22:04,804 --> 00:22:06,404
Mr. Okita was angry

390
00:22:06,404 --> 00:22:08,704
because he was forced to do many impossible stunts.

391
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:10,404
Did he kill Mr. Miyasaka

392
00:22:10,404 --> 00:22:14,004
and pretend that he was the first one to find the body?

393
00:22:14,004 --> 00:22:18,404
Saeko was jealous of the relationship between Mr. Miyasaka and Miki.

394
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:21,904
Her liquid foundation bottle was found at the scene of the crime.

395
00:22:22,904 --> 00:22:26,204
Mr. Yamamoto had a grudge against Mr. Miyasaka for punching him.

396
00:22:26,204 --> 00:22:30,704
Saying that he lost the knife could be a lie.

397
00:22:30,704 --> 00:22:33,604
At any rate, there's no mistake that the culprit

398
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:37,335
is someone who is inside this pension.

399
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,840
Next Conan's Hint:

400
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,910
"Window"

401
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:08,144
Ran, I've figured out who the culprit is!

402
00:24:08,144 --> 00:24:09,427
Just as expected of you, deduction queen.

403
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:11,100
I haven't fired the needle yet.
