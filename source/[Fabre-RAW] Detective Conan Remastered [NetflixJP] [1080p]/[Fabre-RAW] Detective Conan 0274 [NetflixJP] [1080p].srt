1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,470
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,470
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,170
Ran has been feeling weak.

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,170
The appearance of ghost may explain it.

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,770
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,570
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,770
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,510
"Mouri Detective Agency"

9
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,810
Everyone is worrying about you.

10
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,110
You know what they're saying, "She doesn't have a fever,

11
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,910
but, is just playing hooky."

12
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,210
I catch the common cold too.

13
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,510
Your eyes are teary with fever.

14
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,610
And you sure look sexy, Ran!

15
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,210
I'll bet Shinichi would sure love to see you like this.

16
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,510
Okay, I'm going to get going.

17
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,910
You get some rest, understand?

18
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,010
What? Leaving already?

19
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,910
It's sort of creepy here that I don't really want to be alone.

20
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,210
I kind of feel like someone's watching me.

21
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:35,410
What? You mean like a stalker?

22
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,010
What?

23
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,710
No, that's not it.

24
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,010
Then, what is it?

25
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,510
Don't laugh, okay?

26
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,010
Come on, tell me.

27
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,810
I'm sure that it was...

28
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,810
It was?

29
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,410
It was definitely an imp.

30
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,610
See. That sound just now.

31
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,110
It's there, on the other side of the door.

32
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,410
The imp...

33
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,810
Here behind the door? Me?

34
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,310
Shoots.

35
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,110
Strange. Nobody's here, Ran.

36
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,310
But, I heard the rattling sound too.

37
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,310
What should I do?

38
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,010
It's all right. Don't worry about it.

39
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,410
The imp is nothing but a snot nosed brat.

40
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,510
Nothing to fear at all.

41
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:49,810
"The Truth of the Haunted House (Part 1)"

42
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,710
"Araide Clinic"

43
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,110
An imp, in this day and age?

44
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,510
That stuff don't exist.

45
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,710
But...

46
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,510
By the way, doctor, how is she?

47
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,410
Well, she got over her cold.

48
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,510
In fact, she's in great shape.

49
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,810
Being as healthy as she is,

50
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,110
even the ghost will turn tail and run away from her.

51
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,610
By the way, I've been wondering...

52
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,810
What happened to the Granny and the house helper that was here before?

53
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,810
I had them go to Aomori ahead of me.

54
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,110
I remember. You told me once

55
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,810
that you're going to be transferring to a hospital in Aomori.

56
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,210
So, they're going to go there with you too...

57
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:42,210
Yes. But, since I still have to introduce my patients to other hospitals,

58
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,310
so I'm having the hospital in Aomori wait for me

59
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,510
till I'm done with everything.

60
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,210
And besides, I have to go to court

61
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,110
to testify on the case the happened here,

62
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,810
to support Mr. Mouri's deduction.

63
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,510
Yeah, Dr. Araide seems to have heard me

64
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,710
making my deduction from behind the door

65
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,210
and found out about the truth.

66
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,810
I just can't figure out

67
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,810
how you can manage living in such a huge house like this, all alone.

68
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,310
Aren't you scared?

69
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,710
Me, scared?

70
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,010
Well...

71
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,210
It's so spooky here.

72
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,410
Not again.

73
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,710
In this age and day when science and medicine have greatly advanced,

74
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,310
there are no such things as ghosts.

75
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,410
In fact, there are...

76
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:35,110
But people who are narrow-minded can't see them.

77
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,610
They seem to appear in my apartment too,

78
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,410
"Houichi Otonashi (68), Room 5 resident" -carrying out their evil deeds.

79
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,010
Mr. Otonashi.

80
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,010
You've come again.

81
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,710
I believe I told you not to come here anymore.

82
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,510
No use giving me the cold shoulder.

83
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:55,110
I've made up my mind to have you take care of me for the rest of my life.

84
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,910
Who is this old buddy?

85
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:02,210
He's Mr. Otonashi, a patient that has been under my care.

86
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:05,610
But he refuses to go to the hospital I introduced him to...

87
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,510
By the way, gramps, is what you just said true?

88
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,810
About your apartment being haunted by a ghost.

89
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,410
Hey, Conan.

90
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,010
Yeah, it's true.

91
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,810
You want to come over and see, sonny?

92
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:24,010
The restless soul of a young girl who died holding a grudge

93
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,210
still wandering about unable to find peace.

94
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:33,510
I come here to see what's it's like, but what the heck is this?

95
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:37,010
This is nothing more than a shabby apartment.

96
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:40,910
But, look.

97
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,310
There is a park in front of the building.

98
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,610
It's quite peaceful here.

99
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,810
This is the park where a young girl's body was found.

100
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,910
The burned body of the young girl that was charred black.

101
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,610
Burned body?

102
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,410
By the way, the construction of the building beside my apartment

103
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:07,310
has been left as is since the owner committed suicide

104
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,810
after the burst of the financial bubble.

105
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,910
It originally used to be a small cemetery.

106
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,210
Cemetery.

107
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,310
I'll tell you more about inside.

108
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,510
I see.

109
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,810
A perfect location for ghosts to appear.

110
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,810
Dad, I think it's better that we go home after all.

111
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,010
I promise nothing good will happen even if we stay here.

112
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,310
Shut up.

113
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,510
Why don't you just catch a cab and go on home then?

114
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:45,410
No way. It's more frightening to go and stay home by myself.

115
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,210
Besides, Conan looks so interested in ghosts

116
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,210
that I don't think he'll accompany me home either.

117
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,810
What a surprise.

118
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,010
I thought that the boom of ghosts in this apartment ended long ago.

119
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,310
Actually I didn't expect

120
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,610
that people would still come up to this apartment to take a look.

121
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,310
"Kikuji Bancho (34)" -Tonight is going to be an exciting night

122
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,010
"Room 4 resident" -in a long time.

123
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,910
Exciting?

124
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,310
Like they say,

125
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,610
ghosts like to appear where a lot of people gather together.

126
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,410
Who's that?

127
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,710
Mr. Bancho, who is renting Room 4.

128
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,010
He works for a model kit shop.

129
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:28,310
And he often creates spooky figures in his room...

130
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,410
Let's go home right now, Dad!

131
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,010
What if a ghost really appears?

132
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,010
If so, it'd be great.

133
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,710
That'll be a lot of fun. I missed her

134
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,410
because I haven't got to see her for a while.

135
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,610
"Iwahisa Yotsuya (22), Room 2 resident"

136
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,810
Come out.

137
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,110
Who's that guy?

138
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,310
He's Mr. Yotsuya of Room 2.

139
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,510
He's a SFX movie mania

140
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:59,010
and there are tons of those kinds of video tapes in his room.

141
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,110
I heard that he along with his college friends

142
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,710
are making a horror movie of this apartment building

143
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,810
with a 8mm camera.

144
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,410
Well, he never let me see it though.

145
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,510
The movies are totally worthless to watch.

146
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,210
A horror movie based on such unreal things as ghosts

147
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,010
"Tsuyuhiko Botan (27)" -is one of the silliest things.

148
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,910
"Room 1 resident" -That's hog-wash!

149
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,510
Isn't your room supposed to be Room 1?

150
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,310
The restroom downstairs was occupied,

151
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,710
so I went up to the one on the second floor.

152
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:33,110
Anyway, I understand your excitement over the appearance of ghosts,

153
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,910
but try to keep the noise down.

154
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,310
Because I have a thesis to finish by tomorrow.

155
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,810
And, who's he?

156
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:47,010
He's Mr. Botan, a grad student.

157
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:51,210
He's the only resident here who hasn't seen the ghost, yet.

158
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,410
And even if he did see the ghost...

159
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:58,210
The only ones who are staying in this apartment without running away

160
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,910
are Mr. Bancho and Mr. Yotsuya that you just saw a while ago

161
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:06,610
and me, living in Room No.5 on the second floor, just the three of us.

162
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:16,410
So half of the eight residents moved out because of the ghost scare.

163
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,710
Yeah, exactly.

164
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,910
It began when I saw a death candle floating

165
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:27,310
in that building next door at a midnight.

166
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:32,510
In the beginning, none of the residents in this apartment believed me.

167
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:36,110
But suddenly after the water of the toilet turned bloody red,

168
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:40,710
and, a pale figure of a person was seen through the window,

169
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,110
the residents suddenly began feeling faint

170
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,710
and seeing dreadful hallucinations.

171
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,610
Strange and eerie things happened one after the other.

172
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,010
Oh, media people, TV reporters and magazines journalists used come

173
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,610
-and interview us too. -Yeah.

174
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,010
But, why didn't you move out, gramps?

175
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,510
I'm old and have not much time to live.

176
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,210
So there is nothing for me to be scared of.

177
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:08,010
And also I don't want to move out of my dear old house.

178
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,410
Anyway, you're welcome to stay as long as you like.

179
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,810
I think the ghost doesn't want to come out till after dark.

180
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,210
No, thanks. We're leaving now.

181
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,210
Why?

182
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,510
Don't argue with me.

183
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:23,310
Hey, what's the rush?

184
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,610
And it sounds very interesting too.

185
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,310
Come on.

186
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,910
Okay then. Only until 7 pm.

187
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,610
Go home.

188
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,310
Get out...

189
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,510
immediately!

190
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,860
Dad, Dad...

191
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,560
What's up, Ran?

192
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,160
Did something come out?

193
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,860
A scary woman is appearing on the TV screen.

194
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,760
There's nothing on the screen.

195
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,060
No way.

196
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,460
Maybe you had a nightmare or something?

197
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,860
No. I really saw...

198
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,160
Is this late already.

199
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,060
Gee, how could I have fallen asleep like this?

200
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,760
I'm going to go to the john.

201
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,760
Wake that gramps up and tell him that we're heading on home.

202
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,760
Ghosts, my foot. Talk about ridiculous.

203
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,560
After all, it was nothing but a waste of time.

204
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:09,260
What is this? This toilet is so stink and dark.

205
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,960
This place is full of dead insects!

206
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,660
Heck, I should've left here earlier just as Ran said.

207
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,360
Dad. Come, quick.

208
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,060
I can't wake the old man up.

209
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,560
Just a minute. I'll be right there.

210
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,960
What's up, dad?

211
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,560
Blood...

212
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,560
The toilet water is blood red.

213
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,060
No way!

214
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,660
Hey, what's going on here?

215
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,760
What's all the commotion about?

216
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,460
The...

217
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,860
The toilet water is blood red, my father said.

218
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,460
I knew she'd come here.

219
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,760
Really?

220
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,560
Ridiculous.

221
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,660
This is someone's idea of a sick joke.

222
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,660
He must have put red paint in the tank water.

223
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,960
I guess not...

224
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,060
Could it be that you had blood in your urine?

225
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,060
No darn way!

226
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,160
When I flushed it,

227
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,560
the water turned the color of blood all of a sudden.

228
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,560
A dreadful illusion appearing after feeling faint.

229
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,760
Water suddenly turning red.

230
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,060
Then all that's left to happen

231
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,360
is a spooky figure looking inside through the window.

232
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,960
Here she comes...

233
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,560
What?

234
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,860
She's appeared!

235
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,060
What?

236
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,360
What the heck is that?

237
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,860
Can't you tell what you're looking at?

238
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,960
The ghost has come...

239
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,360
The ghost of the girl that was killed in the park nearby.

240
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,860
Her spirit has come.

241
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,060
It... It disappeared...

242
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,060
Of course, because it's a real ghost.

243
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:22,860
She may already be in this apartment.

244
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,660
What? Ghosts my foot!

245
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,560
Someone must have crawled up the wall to the second floor

246
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,560
and stuck his head out of the window to frighten us.

247
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,260
Get out of the way! I'll go check it out!

248
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,460
Okay, but here is...

249
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,760
No one can crawl up to and stand here

250
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,160
because there is no veranda or anything like that on this window.

251
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,460
Yeah, I guess so.

252
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,860
And it didn't look like a human figure.

253
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,760
The outline of it wiggled like jelly

254
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,160
and the shadow already started losing shape before the window opened.

255
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,360
-It's like... -It's like a demon burning to ashes

256
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,960
when the morning sun, touches it, right?

257
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,860
Grandpa.

258
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,260
I've also seen her in the window before.

259
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,960
It was too painful to look at her.

260
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,760
Well, it stands to reason that she disappeared like ashes.

261
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:29,560
Because that ghost is supposed to be the restless soul of Ms. Rui Tabuchi

262
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,460
who was burned to death in the park four years ago.

263
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,060
Ms. Rui Tabuchi?

264
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,760
Yeah, her driver's license narrowly escaped burning up.

265
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,260
The police said that her teeth matched.

266
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:46,860
So long as the two guys who killed her don't get arrested,

267
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,860
her soul will never rest in peace and go to heaven.

268
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,760
The two guys?

269
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,760
Weren't there any witnesses?

270
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:00,360
Yes. A person who happened to be passing by the park after midnight,

271
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,360
saw two men nearby staring at the burning body.

272
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,560
There, as you can also see on the poster that is posted

273
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,860
onto the street lamp that you can see from the window.

274
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:15,260
It's a portrait of one of the two murderers.

275
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,460
An evil looking guy with a scar across his cheek.

276
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,860
Another guy was with him in the park,

277
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,160
but his face couldn't be seen because it was dark.

278
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,260
Anyway, the old man that was here a while ago

279
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,760
is the only one who had been living here

280
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,360
from before the incident happened.

281
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,360
Oh, yeah.

282
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,660
Hey! Did she appear again?

283
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,860
Bugs...

284
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,160
A moth is on your arm, Dad!

285
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,560
Moths are very common around here.

286
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,260
It probably came in through the window.

287
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,760
I hear that lots of moths are living in the park

288
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,660
where the incident happened.

289
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,260
They often fly over here because this apartment

290
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,360
is right in front of the park.

291
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,460
Give me a break.

292
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,560
It's just a moth. Cut out the noise!

293
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,260
She completely screwed up this ghostly mood, for god's sake!

294
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,860
I think her screaming was just great.

295
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,260
Whatever. Anyway stop all this racket, please!

296
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,460
The strange shadow that we just saw,

297
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,760
was probably only a reflection of one of us on the window.

298
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,860
You idiot.

299
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,260
That's for real.

300
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,960
Sure, sure.

301
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,060
I told you, didn't I?

302
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,160
If we stay here, nothing good will happen to us.

303
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,760
So, Dad, let's hurry on home.

304
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,260
Hey, Conan! Hurry it up.

305
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,760
Come on, Conan. What're you doing?

306
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,560
Hey, Pops!

307
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,460
Are you sure that the water in the toilet became bright red with blood?

308
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,760
Yeah.

309
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,560
I'm not sure whether it was blood or not,

310
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,660
but I'm sure that the water became bright red.

311
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,160
Now that I think of it,

312
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,960
it could have been red water caused by a rusty water pipe.

313
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,560
It's strange.

314
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,560
I'm sure there was a sharp acidy smell just a while ago. But now...

315
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,760
I guess it was aired out

316
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,960
because the door has been left open.

317
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,560
It may be so.

318
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,260
It smells of alcohol.

319
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,660
Hey. That's enough.

320
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,360
I just want to look more closely

321
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,660
and share it with my classmates at school.

322
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,660
That the ghost scared the great detective,

323
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,960
Kogoro Mouri out of his wits!

324
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,160
Insolent.

325
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,760
Hey, Ran!

326
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,260
We're not leaving yet.

327
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,660
What? How come?

328
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,560
Because ghosts don't exist.

329
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,260
It's all illusions.

330
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,660
A strange figure in the window

331
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,960
was just a reflection of someone among us.

332
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,960
Bloody toilet water was actually rusty water.

333
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,560
This ominous, gloomy atmosphere just lulled me to develop delusions.

334
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,560
So then, what about the woman I saw?

335
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,960
I really saw her on the TV screen.

336
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,960
A woman suffering serious burns,

337
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,960
said, "Go home. Go home."

338
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,160
That was just an illusion too!

339
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,360
There were no ghost programs listed on the TV column

340
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,960
of the newspaper either.

341
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,460
But...

342
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,060
Well, another likely explanation is...

343
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,460
That the resident of this room showed us a spooky video

344
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,760
in order to make us believe that this place is haunted.

345
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,460
Are you talking about me?

346
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,560
That's not possible.

347
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,060
I checked it out right away back then,

348
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,660
but there was no tape in this VCR then.

349
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,160
Whatever. Instead, what I can't understand

350
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,560
is why we all fell asleep together back then.

351
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,760
Isn't that because of the curse?

352
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,260
Nonsense! Impossible!

353
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:16,260
If someone step onto this window rail, it seems it would collapse easily.

354
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,860
The apartment building is enclosed with high walls.

355
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,860
And when I look out this window,

356
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,560
I see the building under construction before my eyes.

357
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,960
Conan.

358
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,560
What're you doing with the window open?

359
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,560
The bugs will fly in again.

360
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,760
Well, I was just wondering

361
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,860
about where of that building gramps saw the death candle.

362
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:41,660
It was in the darkness around the center of that building.

363
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:46,160
A red light was looming and moving about in the sadly in the air.

364
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,560
At times it turned a bluish white light too, I think.

365
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,660
What does this mean anyhow?

366
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,960
We suddenly go faint,

367
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,460
then the apparition appears on TV.

368
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,760
The toilet water suddenly turns red.

369
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,360
Both can be explained scientifically,

370
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,960
but I just can't understand

371
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,760
the other two the death candle and the figure by the window.

372
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,560
How did the culprit do it?

373
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,760
In the first place, is there really a culprit at all?

374
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,060
If so, who is it,

375
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,360
and for what reason is this being done?

376
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,520
Next Conan's Hint:

377
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,760
"Beaker"
