1
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,690
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,400
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,190
Today's trick is the bungee jump.

4
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,070
The case is solved with the courage to jump forward.

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,780
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,870
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,160
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:42,220
"The Amusement Park Bungee Jump"

9
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:46,100
"Nichiuri Amusement Park"

10
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,980
What's with this place, anyway?

11
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,640
You're the one who kept on saying

12
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,770
you wanted to come to an amusement park.

13
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,060
Yes, that's true.

14
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,940
This is an amusement park, Nichiuri Amusement Park.

15
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,860
Goodness. What I meant is an amusement spot like this.

16
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,660
Tropical Iand!

17
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,660
So, why do we end up here in Nichiuri Amusement Park?

18
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,950
What's the difference?

19
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,040
There are a lot of rides, too.

20
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,460
The contents is totally different.

21
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,460
Shut up, brat!

22
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,760
They have no attractions!

23
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,470
They do. That looks interesting.

24
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,050
Yaiba!

25
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,140
Yaiba Fight!

26
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,270
I'd like to watch a more sophisticated show!

27
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,270
A show is a show, what's the difference?

28
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,150
Anyway, you two go on. I'll be right back.

29
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,860
Huh?

30
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,240
How come you have a boat racing newspaper on you, Pops?

31
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,080
I wonder why that was in my pocket?

32
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,670
Dad.

33
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,340
Yaiba Kick!

34
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,140
Darn it! I'll get you for this, Yaiba!

35
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,350
Black!

36
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,440
Yaiba!

37
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,070
If it was me 10 years ago, I'd had really enjoyed it.

38
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,660
How lousy.

39
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,160
Hey, Conan.

40
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,380
Where's Pops?

41
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,250
See, over there.

42
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,260
Surprised? It's called Bungee Jump.

43
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,980
Gosh, that was startling.

44
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,360
It was super fantastic!

45
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,270
Conan, look over there.

46
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,950
Remember...

47
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,570
You better keep your word.

48
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,660
-What? -I told him...

49
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,540
that I'd go to the boat races with him if he bungee jumps.

50
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,250
I am scared.

51
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,380
But I'll do it!

52
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,960
Hey, mister, will you hurry up?

53
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,050
You're backing up traffic.

54
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,970
Hey, look out!

55
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,350
Are you going to be all right?

56
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,150
Maybe you'd better not try it.

57
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,360
No, I've got to do it.

58
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,570
I've got my reasons.

59
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,150
I thought Pops didn't like high places.

60
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,780
Is that so?

61
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,870
Just what do you think you're doing?

62
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,740
You've got your reasons, right?

63
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,950
There.

64
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,170
Will you please jump?

65
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,340
Shut up! It's up to me when I jump.

66
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,470
Masked Yaiba fled because he was afraid of me!

67
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,140
Now the world is ours, the Blackians!

68
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,650
Nevermind and just get out of the way, will you?

69
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,860
I don't know what, but what a life saver.

70
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,660
Let's give them a great performance like always.

71
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,540
Yaiba are not going to come no matter how much you wait!

72
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,250
He fled leaving you behind!

73
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,250
There's no way!

74
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,050
Yaiba will surely come.

75
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,550
Help, Yaiba!

76
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,760
Yaiba...

77
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,050
Shut up!

78
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,060
Yaiba won't come no matter how much you call him!

79
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,640
Yaiba is here!

80
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,060
What?

81
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,440
Yaiba?

82
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,770
Yaiba!

83
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,360
When the doll on the roller coaster disappears like always,

84
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,660
you're on!

85
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,580
Sorry to keep you waiting, Blackian.

86
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,750
I'm not letting you do as you please!

87
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,540
This is quite a performance.

88
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,880
Yes.

89
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,670
I am sorry!

90
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,460
Please don't worry, Princess.

91
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,170
I'll rescue you right away!

92
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,560
Here goes, Yaiba.

93
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:51,570
Yaiba Jump...

94
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,660
I wonder if that was part of the performance.

95
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,250
-No, I don't think so. -Huh?

96
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,960
Because the audience can't see him diving into the water.

97
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,760
Hey, Hosono!

98
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,180
Are you all right, Hosono?

99
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,680
Oh, no! Get the rescue squad!

100
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,350
Hosono fell!

101
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,560
What? He fell?

102
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,770
It's already 20 minutes since he fell.

103
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,740
What's that?

104
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,880
The cut rubber is burnt.

105
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,880
Which means that this is not an accident.

106
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,680
She's the one I bumped into.

107
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,050
Maybe...

108
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,970
Excuse me.

109
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,850
Hey, we found him!

110
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,570
Poor thing.

111
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,450
I think you should contact Inspector Megure.

112
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,950
Because maybe...

113
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,080
Is anything the matter, Conan?

114
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,170
Look at that.

115
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:35,170
That rubber looks like it's burnt from the inside.

116
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:38,670
If it was broken normally, it won't have burnt mark like that.

117
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,850
I see.

118
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,980
It didn't break naturally.

119
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,650
Is this homicide after all, Inspector Megure?

120
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,440
You're the one who said so, didn't you?

121
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,860
I guess so.

122
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,780
Officer Takagi, please get all those involved together.

123
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,870
Yes, sir!

124
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,460
So, that's where the corpse was pulled up from.

125
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,480
This water...

126
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,150
It's wet all the way from there.

127
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,240
He's the boy that looked bored watching the Yaiba Show.

128
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,660
Maybe...

129
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,370
Hey, you!

130
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,880
How was it, sir?

131
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,880
Yes. I just went and looked,

132
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,260
and I found just one that was drenched, like you said.

133
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,260
Just as I thought.

134
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,680
But why are you asking me something like that, sonny?

135
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,680
Okay. Let's go, Tomohiro.

136
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,270
Hey, go where?

137
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,980
We're going to nab the bad guys!

138
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,480
For Yaiba!

139
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,780
The victim is Yuta Hosono, age 28,

140
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,660
a member of HO Theater.

141
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,950
The rubber used when bungee jumping

142
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,250
during his performance as Yaiba

143
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,160
in the Masked Yaiba Show seems to have severed,

144
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,250
which lead him to drowned to death.

145
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,170
You're the one who set the rubber on the victim's feet?

146
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,260
"Akiyoshi Ishijima (25)" -Yes, I always do so.

147
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,470
Did you notice anything wrong with the rubber then?

148
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,760
If so, I wouldn't have made him jump.

149
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,550
Well, I guess so.

150
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,560
And you guys belong to the same acting team as Mr. Hosono, right?

151
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,480
"Shinpei Okubo (28)" -Yes, My name is Okubo.

152
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,570
I usually do onstage plays,

153
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,860
but that's not enough to make a living.

154
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,570
I see, that's why you're acting in the Yaiba Show.

155
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,660
So, Mr. Okubo is the bad guy.

156
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,070
And you are...

157
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,580
I am Kanako Harukawa acting as the Princess.

158
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,870
I'm Wataru Otake.

159
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,250
I do everything behind the scenes from sets

160
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,380
and special effects.

161
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,550
Special effects?

162
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,970
Special effects like exploding dynamite on stage and such.

163
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,680
And you?

164
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,760
"Seizou Fujita (40)" -I am Fujita,

165
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,180
the person in charge of the events

166
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,470
that are held at Nichiuri Land.

167
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,680
Huh?

168
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,980
Where is the person who was in the Yaiba costume

169
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,560
riding the roller coaster?

170
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,570
That's a doll.

171
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,280
We would actually like to hire and actor to do the part,

172
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,070
but we're short of hands now.

173
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,780
Why have we all been called here?

174
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,080
Hosono died of an accident, didn't he?

175
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,370
Well, as the investigation progressed,

176
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,870
it's starting to turn out that an accident is not the only possibility.

177
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,580
Yes.

178
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,750
This is apparently homicide!

179
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,670
And the killer is someone here!

180
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,260
There's got to be someone here

181
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,760
that has a grudge against Mr. Hosono.

182
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,850
Isn't that right, Mr. Ishijima?

183
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:22,060
Okubo argued with Hosono about the management of the the theater.

184
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,150
You're the one who borrowed money

185
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,360
from Hosono and were having problems!

186
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,480
Never mind about me!

187
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,150
Kanako was also upset

188
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:32,360
because Hosono kept asking her to go with him.

189
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,660
It just troubled me a bit!

190
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,580
Otake, you were pissed at Hosono, too.

191
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,250
Because he makes you run errands for him, weren't you?

192
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,870
Doesn't that go for all of you?

193
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:46,090
There was no trouble between Hosono and I.

194
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,880
Which means all of you

195
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,180
except Mr. Fujita have a motive to kill Mr. Hosono.

196
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:02,350
You're the one who killed Masked Yaiba, that is, Mr. Hosono!

197
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,480
You've got to be kidding!

198
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,570
Just because I operate the bungee jump,

199
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,440
is it my fault?

200
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,580
This rubber was severed because of the explosion.

201
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:21,750
You're the only one who can set an explosive onto his feet.

202
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,250
We can tell by looking at this.

203
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,250
What?

204
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,080
I borrowed this video tape

205
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,460
from someone who shot the scene of Yaiba diving.

206
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,380
I see. It could turn out to be evidence.

207
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,550
Let's take a look at it, Mouri.

208
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,470
Yes, I guess so.

209
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,980
I am sorry.

210
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,360
Stop!

211
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,030
This smoke is when the dynamite exploded.

212
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,030
It is most likely that

213
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,620
when the rubber was strapped to his feet

214
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,130
an explosive was rigged to his feet.

215
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,420
And after Yaiba jumped,

216
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,630
he pushed the switch of the explosive when the time came.

217
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,800
Why don't you admit it, Mr. Ishijima?

218
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,930
How can I admit something I didn't do?

219
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,810
What's the use resisting at this point?

220
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,020
Take a look at this.

221
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,310
See, right here

222
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,610
Doesn't it look like Yaiba is touching the rubber?

223
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,820
It does look that way.

224
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,610
How is it, Mouri? You were close by, aren't you?

225
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,200
Come to think of it,

226
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:46,000
Masked Yaiba did put his finger into the rubber.

227
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,500
Take a look at this, too.

228
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,340
Don't you notice something strange?

229
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,920
You're the one that's strange.

230
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,710
Although the fingers of his left hand are extended out,

231
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,300
the fingers of his right are grabbed into a fist?

232
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,010
Bull's eye!

233
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,430
Isn't that the way Yaiba poses?

234
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,930
No, this is the first time I've seen him posing like this.

235
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,810
Could it be that he was holding something in his right hand?

236
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:11,730
Something like a switch to set off explosives.

237
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,110
What?

238
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,230
That's suicide!

239
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,320
That's right, it is a suicide!

240
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,200
That's what Hosono did. Right?

241
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,410
That too, is a possible deduction.

242
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:28,410
Well, if you say so, Inspector.

243
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,210
No.

244
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,010
This is homicide.

245
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,930
Then, are you saying that the killer is Mr. Ishijima?

246
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,600
I am telling you I didn't do it!

247
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
Before we accuse anyone as being the killer,

248
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,930
let's check everybody's alibi.

249
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,600
First, Mr. Okubo.

250
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,230
I was acting as the Blackian on stage.

251
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:58,030
I was likewise on stage, acting as princess.

252
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,820
I was backstage and in charge of the fireworks.

253
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,910
Mr. Ishijima was on the gondola.

254
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,200
-Right. -What about you, Mr. Fujita?

255
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,830
I was here, putting my papers in order.

256
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,630
Can anyone testify that for you?

257
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:17,000
No, because I was alone.

258
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,130
I didn't mention it a while ago,

259
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,300
but you had trouble with Hosono too, didn't you?

260
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,510
What are you talking about?

261
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,720
In return for letting Hosono's acting team perform here,

262
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,430
you were getting commission, weren't you?

263
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:32,020
But Hosono didn't pay you the money, right?

264
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,100
Shut up!

265
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,610
Well, let's hear all of what Mouri has to say first.

266
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,740
As you already saw in the video,

267
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,910
there is a possibility that Masked Yaiba

268
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,120
set the explosive off himself.

269
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,530
Like I said, it's suicide.

270
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:51,410
No, even so, there still is a possibility of homicide.

271
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,710
If the person who was acting as Masked Yaiba

272
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,830
was not Mr. Hosono.

273
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,710
The killer probably waited until Mr. Hosono

274
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,510
was alone to attacked him,

275
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,010
and knocked him unconscious.

276
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:10,310
And while still wearing his costume,

277
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,520
the killer carried him to the river

278
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
and drowned him.

279
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,820
After that, the killer went over to the waiting room

280
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,400
and put on the extra Masked Yaiba outfit.

281
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,030
Then, he went on stage and acted as if he were Masked Yaiba himself.

282
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,620
The killer pretended to confirm the rubber strap

283
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,910
while on the gondola,

284
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,830
and after he stuck the explosive on,

285
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,210
he jumped!

286
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,130
He set the explosive off with the remote control switch

287
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,710
he was holding in his right hand.

288
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,300
The killer dove into the water

289
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,430
and swam to the back of the pump room,

290
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:52,100
changed costumes and went back to where everyone was.

291
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,940
But it's about 100 meters

292
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,520
from the position of the crane to the pump room.

293
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,610
A compact regulator was used.

294
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:05,110
That way, he can stay underwater for about 10 minutes.

295
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,410
Well? Can you point out any mistakes?

296
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,410
The one who killed Mr. Hosono

297
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,330
is you, Mr. Wataru Otake!

298
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,420
Ridiculous!

299
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,800
I was in charge of the explosives during the show, you know!

300
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:28,720
Did anyone see Mr. Otake around during the show?

301
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,720
-No, I didn't. -Neither did I.

302
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,100
Then, who took care of the explosives

303
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,600
that were used during the show?

304
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,810
The person that will answer that question

305
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,730
is a boy who is a fan of Masked Yaiba,

306
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,810
Tomohiro Takada.

307
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,110
Tell them, Tomohiro.

308
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,400
Okay.

309
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,200
I could tell right away

310
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,530
that the person who was wearing the Yaiba outfit

311
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,620
was not the usual person!

312
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,120
His movements were bad,

313
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,200
and his kick missed its target, too.

314
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,920
And besides, Yaiba always poses before an explosion.

315
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,000
He goes like this and like this!

316
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,920
That's his usual pose before the explosion.

317
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,510
Yes, but today it was different.

318
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,140
How?

319
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,430
The minute he placed his hand on his hip, it exploded.

320
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:16,310
He usually shouts Yaiba before the explosion.

321
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:19,100
Come to think of it, it was faster than usual.

322
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,310
I missed the timing a bit.

323
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,730
Besides...

324
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,820
Yaiba's pose was different from always.

325
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,200
Yaiba usually poses...

326
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,410
not by extending all the finger of his left hand straight,

327
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,700
but he points and the sky with his index finger!

328
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,830
It's different from the one on TV,

329
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:43,000
but he always poses that way at the show here.

330
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,130
When Yaiba came to our town,

331
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,300
it rained and the Yaiba Show was canceled.

332
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,510
So, he promised us this pose as a token of his apology.

333
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,720
In other words,

334
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,220
you remote controlled the explosion of the show

335
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,520
using the switch you had on your hips.

336
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,610
That's no proof!

337
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:08,820
The proof is on your body!

338
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,030
On your feet!

339
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,200
The burn marks from the explosives!

340
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,910
After all, you exploded something strong enough

341
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:23,500
to sever the super strong rubber used for bungee jumping.

342
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,000
-Excuse me. -No!

343
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,710
Wataru.

344
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,430
Let's go get some ice cream, Tomohiro.

345
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,100
That guy...

346
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,810
Hosono insisted that I could never handle the role of Masked Yaiba.

347
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,820
I can handle the movements of Masked Yaiba

348
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,530
just as good or better than you can, Hosono!

349
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:53,200
Don't think you can be Masked Yaiba just by looks.

350
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,030
You need certain qualifications to be a hero.

351
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,910
He had the nerve to squawk to me

352
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,710
about qualifications and what not's.

353
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,830
All it was is that he was jealous of me

354
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,420
and wanted to get rid of me!

355
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:13,430
He was probably referring to

356
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,510
is the qualifications of the "heart".

357
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,510
What?

358
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,810
It is impossible for a person with a heart like you,

359
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,100
who can't take the remarks of another

360
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,600
as meaning only evil to act out a hero.

361
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:31,030
Mr. Hosono's finger of his left hand which pointed at the sky

362
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:35,410
was a sign of friendship between Mr. Hosono and the children.

363
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,510
So, we didn't get to go after all.

364
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,010
I am going to go to Tropical Land next time with my boyfriend.

365
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,810
Boyfriend?

366
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,020
Don't tell me it's that detective brat?

367
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,940
Of course, it's not with Shinichi!

368
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,310
Then, who is it?

369
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,030
He's my boyfriend!

370
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,120
Well... well, I guess so.
