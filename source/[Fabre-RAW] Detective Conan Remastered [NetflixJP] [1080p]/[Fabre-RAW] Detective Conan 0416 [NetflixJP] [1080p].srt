1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,860
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,560
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,260
The mystery deepens with the second incident.

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,860
It is the existence of something that's not supposed to.

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,760
This gives the evil spirit racket a boost!

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,260
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,160
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,360
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,220
We were invited to a wealthy person's residence in Shizuoka prefecture.

10
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,920
But the request of the client was a difficult one,

11
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,220
asking to scientifically explain the curse of an evil spirit.

12
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,820
At the house,

13
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,120
for the past few years,

14
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,820
they say on Butsumetsu the 4th, something bad always occurs.

15
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,420
And on Butsumetsu of October 4th,

16
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,120
the misfortune befalls the first victim.

17
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,220
The victim is Mr. Toshimichi Sekiguchi, age 43.

18
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,120
Well, we can't tell whether it's suicide or homicide yet, but...

19
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,020
This card that reads, "I atone my sins of 13 years ago"

20
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,220
is sure to be the key to solving the case.

21
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,420
It was just about 13 years ago.

22
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:48,120
The master's cruiser had a marine accident.

23
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,020
Is there anybody here that is the bereaved family of a victim

24
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,920
of that accident and working here?

25
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,020
Yes.

26
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:03,520
"The Evil Spirit that Appears on Butsumetsu (Suspicion)"

27
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,020
Will each of you introduce yourselves

28
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,320
and tell me of the person that died in the accident 13 years ago?

29
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,020
Let's see...

30
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,620
Then, why don't we start with Shigeko?

31
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,820
Yes.

32
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,620
I'm Shigeko Senzaki, the housekeeper.

33
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,620
I lost my husband who used to work here as a chef in the accident.

34
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,820
He was in charge of preparing the meals during the cruise.

35
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:34,320
My daughter and I were also scheduled to go on the cruise,

36
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,720
but we were both in bed with a cold.

37
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,020
After father died, I succeeded him and work here as a chef.

38
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,620
I also have succeeded my father and work here as a chauffeur.

39
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,420
I'm Masashi Watabiki.

40
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,420
I lost my father and younger brother in the accident.

41
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,220
You lost both members of your family?

42
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,220
Yes, sir.

43
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,220
My father was in charge of sailing the ship, so he had no choice.

44
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,420
But my younger brother just happened to go along.

45
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,820
It's truly regrettable.

46
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:10,920
The last victim was my wife who used to work as a housekeeper here.

47
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,620
She was a great wife who used to help me out with my job as a steward, too.

48
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,720
Who would've thought that she would end up like that?

49
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,420
Akatsuka...

50
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,520
Hey! Just what do you think you're doing?

51
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,420
Forcing us to tell you what we don't want to recall!

52
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:33,420
Well, you see, I figured that maybe the one who killed Mr. Sekiguchi

53
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,820
could be among you guys.

54
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,320
After all, it's strange.

55
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,420
Even after seeing the card, "I am the fifth soul",

56
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,020
none of you mentioned anything about the marine accident 13 years ago.

57
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,320
Could it be that you already know who the killer is,

58
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,320
but not telling us and protecting the killer?

59
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,020
No way!

60
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,820
After all, four people died in the accident, you know!

61
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,220
There aren't five souls!

62
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,220
One, two, three, four...

63
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,220
That's true.

64
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,620
In the first place, the accident occurred on September 29th

65
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,720
on Taian (lucky day) 13 years ago.

66
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,320
It wasn't on the 4th, nor was it on Butsumetsu!

67
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,220
Oh, I see.

68
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:22,320
Besides, I don't think the chef and housekeeper could've done it.

69
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,420
Because... Look!

70
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,720
Mr. Sekiguchi was found hanging on the veranda.

71
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,820
I see!

72
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,220
Namika who has aerophobia can't go near it.

73
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,620
That's true, but what about Shigeko?

74
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,320
The killer hung Mr. Sekiguchi to make it look like suicide, right?

75
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,020
If so, the killer would look below before doing so, right?

76
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,320
In order to make sure that nobody is watching.

77
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,020
If you look below from where Mr. Sekiguchi was hung,

78
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,220
the pointed bars of the steel fence comes into view

79
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,320
and it's kind of scary.

80
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,620
I see!

81
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,820
Shigeko who has beloniphobia would probably avoid this place

82
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,220
and hang the victim more to the side.

83
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,120
Conan, way to go!

84
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,020
The chauffeur Mr. Watabiki was driving the car

85
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,020
together with Mr. and Mr. Kunitomo at the time of the murder.

86
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,020
So he couldn't have committed the murder.

87
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,420
Which means you're the only one left, Mr. Akatsuka.

88
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,020
No.

89
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,020
I don't think the steward did it either!

90
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,920
Look at the two cards carefully.

91
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,720
The writing is slanted and slightly out of place, right?

92
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,820
Come to think of it...

93
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,620
In other words, Mr. Akatsuka who is a meticulous perfectionist

94
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,320
would never write such a card.

95
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,920
But the killer could've pretended

96
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,620
to have such a habit or phobia to throw people off.

97
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,520
Conan...

98
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,720
Just as Conan has mentioned,

99
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,020
all of the habits and phobia can deliberately be acted out.

100
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,120
At any rate,

101
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,220
I would like you all to come down once

102
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,620
so that I can interrogate you individually.

103
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,520
I would like to also take your fingerprints.

104
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,020
Of all things,

105
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,820
why do we have to get our fingerprints taken, too?

106
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,220
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,420
I need it to make out which fingerprint is the killer's.

108
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,420
And? What about the alibis of the rest of the suspects?

109
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:31,120
The alibis of everyone except Mr. Watabiki are quite ambiguous.

110
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,920
So everyone's fingerprints were taken except for Mr. Kunitomo's,

111
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,420
but only Mr. Sekiguchi's fingerprints were found on the rope so far.

112
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,320
Why didn't you take the fingerprints of Mr. Kunitomo?

113
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,020
Well...

114
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,720
He said he won't see anybody until October 4th is over

115
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,420
and locked himself in the room on the third floor.

116
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,620
Hey, dear. Will you cut it out?

117
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,720
-Dear? -Well, hold your horses.

118
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,720
If something comes up, we can discuss it later, you and me.

119
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,120
I'll see you later.

120
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,120
Dear?

121
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,320
This is absurd!

122
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,420
Dear?

123
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:17,120
Don't tell me that there's somebody in there with Mr. Kunitomo?

124
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,020
-Huh? -It can't be!

125
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,820
He said that he didn't want to see anybody, didn't he?

126
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,320
Mrs. Kunitomo.

127
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,120
Where is this interphone connected to?

128
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,620
Our bedroom.

129
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,320
In other words, it's the room where Mr. Sekiguchi was hanging,

130
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,920
the room right above ours!

131
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,420
Conan!

132
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,820
Rope?

133
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,820
Hey, Conan.

134
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,620
The pill has been crushed.

135
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,920
There was somebody here after all.

136
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,120
But there are no traces of the window being forced opened.

137
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,520
He couldn't have forgotten to lock them under these circumstances.

138
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,520
How in the world

139
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,620
did the killer get inside?

140
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,020
We've got to call an ambulance right away.

141
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,520
Although under these circumstances, it may already be too late.

142
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,820
The thing that bothers me is that rope.

143
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,620
If my deduction is correct...

144
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,820
The culprit is still...

145
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,620
What?

146
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,620
The boy with the glasses got into the room on the third floor?

147
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,420
There was a rope tied to the veranda where Mr. Sekiguchi was found hanging

148
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,020
so he climbed up that rope to the third floor.

149
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,820
Hey, kid!

150
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,920
-Open up! -Hey.

151
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,320
Hurry up and open the door!

152
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:15,120
Intruder...

153
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,220
-A bell? -Intruder.

154
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:22,320
Intruder...

155
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,720
What in the world is happening?

156
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,620
What's with this alarm?

157
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,820
Did you do something?

158
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,120
Conan?

159
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,420
Sorry.

160
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,120
Dad tried to force his way in

161
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,620
and touched the fingerprint recognition device

162
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,520
despite that only the people who live here are allowed to touch it.

163
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,120
At any rate, stop the alarm and open the door.

164
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,220
Do you know where the button is?

165
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,820
I'll open the door now.

166
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,820
But other than Pops and Officer Yokomizo, please don't come inside.

167
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,220
But they're already...

168
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,120
Master!

169
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,620
Hey, hey, everybody's inside.

170
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,120
His pulse is gone and he's not breathing.

171
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,320
Dear? Why?

172
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,120
I'll call an ambulance!

173
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,620
I'll go inform the officer who is below about this.

174
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,920
Wait!

175
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,120
I already called the ambulance.

176
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,020
Everyone, please don't move from here.

177
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,670
Ran?

178
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,670
Are you still outside the door?

179
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,670
I'm here.

180
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:43,470
Then look out for any strange person that comes out, okay?

181
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,070
Inspector Yokomizo and Pops,

182
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,970
will you both check to see if there are traces of the windows

183
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,270
of the other rooms on the third floor having been forced opened?

184
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,470
Why?

185
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,970
Look at this.

186
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:01,170
This is a trace of pills being stepped on, right?

187
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,470
It means somebody was here, right?

188
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,270
Right.

189
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,670
Whoever it was probably surprised Mr. Kunitomo,

190
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:13,470
causing him to get an attack and kept him from having his medicine.

191
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,170
And this rope...

192
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,670
Is probably what the killer used to get away.

193
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,970
It wasn't swaying!

194
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,370
-What? -Huh?

195
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:26,870
I heard Mr. Kunitomo's loud voice from the interphone on the third floor,

196
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,870
so I went to the room downstairs and found the rope.

197
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,370
It didn't even take me a minute.

198
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,370
Hey. Don't tell me...

199
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:38,470
Right. Maybe the killer saw me climbing the rope

200
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,270
and decided not to run away, but came back to this room instead?

201
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,170
Could be.

202
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,670
If the killer surprised Mr. Kunitomo to induce a heart attack,

203
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:51,670
took the medicine bottle away, stepped on the pill and crush it

204
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,770
and fled after making sure that Mr. Kunitomo was dead,

205
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,870
it would take at least a minute.

206
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,470
The rope should still be swaying.

207
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,570
Which means that

208
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,570
it is very likely that the killer is still here on the third floor.

209
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,170
Why don't we split up and look for the killer?

210
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,470
Good idea!

211
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,770
That's too dangerous.

212
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,270
What if you run into the killer?

213
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,870
But if we dilly-dally, the killer will get away!

214
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,770
Wouldn't it be faster if we all go look for the killer together?

215
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,170
Okay, let's do this then.

216
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,270
We search one room at a time.

217
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,370
First, I'll go in an check the windows.

218
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,970
You all come into the room after me.

219
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,570
Mr. Mouri, please go out into the corridor

220
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,670
and stay on the look out for any suspicious person.

221
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,970
Okay!

222
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,970
Nothing abnormal!

223
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,170
Please come in.

224
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,670
Nobody's here.

225
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,070
No one here either.

226
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,970
Let's go on to the next room then.

227
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,970
We searched all the rooms, but there was no suspicious person anywhere.

228
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,970
Moreover, all the windows on the third floor were locked from the inside

229
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,670
and there were no traces of the windows being forced opened either.

230
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,270
Hey, Ran! Can you hear me?

231
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,270
Have you seen anyone leave from that door?

232
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,770
Three paramedics carrying a stretcher went in and out though.

233
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,070
Nobody besides them passed.

234
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,770
Which means that...

235
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:38,070
This kid is making up stories.

236
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,670
What's with you, man?

237
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,170
No, there is still another possibility.

238
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,170
Huh?

239
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,370
When Conan opened the door with the fingerprint recognition device

240
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,070
and we went inside,

241
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,170
the killer who was hiding on the third floor

242
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,370
could've joined in among us.

243
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,970
No way.

244
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,470
Wait a sec!

245
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,070
Are you saying that the killer is among us?

246
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,670
Well, not really.

247
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,470
We all ran here after hearing the alarm, you know!

248
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:08,470
Didn't you see us come in from behind you?

249
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:14,470
Well, I do remember that Mrs. Kunitomo was with us right through, but...

250
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,770
Mr. Mouri, do you remember?

251
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,170
Not at all.

252
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,470
Didn't I tell you not to let anybody else inside?

253
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:25,970
We'll appoint an officer to stand guard in front of the security door

254
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,270
and close off the third floor.

255
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:32,170
As for all of you, please let me question you once again,

256
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,370
understood?

257
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:39,770
In other words, when Mr. Kunitomo was heard shouting over the interphone

258
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,970
of the third floor with the fingerprint recognition device,

259
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,070
aside from Mrs. Kunitomo who was with us,

260
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,770
the alibis of the four of you are ambiguous.

261
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,670
Ambiguous?

262
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:54,670
We were staying still in our rooms just as the police told us to.

263
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,170
We all have our own rooms.

264
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,570
Why didn't you appoint an officer

265
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:01,670
to stand guard in front of our rooms then?

266
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,670
Oh, well...

267
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,370
The point is,

268
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,270
regardless of Mr. Kunitomo saying that

269
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,970
he would not see anyone until October 4th is over,

270
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,870
how did the killer enter the room?

271
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,270
Come to think of it, back then

272
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:19,570
along with my husband's voice through the interphone...

273
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,570
I'll see you later.

274
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,570
I think I heard what sounded like a knock.

275
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:32,170
My husband didn't seem to be surprised by that sound.

276
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,870
A knock.

277
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:39,770
And right after that, he suddenly shouted and started suffering?

278
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,370
Yes.

279
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:45,370
Don't tell me that he invited someone in on his own?

280
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,270
That can't be.

281
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,670
Mr. Kunitomo sent the officers who were investigating the third floor

282
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,970
on Mr. Sekiguchi's case out

283
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,170
and confined himself to his room on the third floor, you know?

284
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,770
Why would he invite someone in?

285
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,070
Even if he were to have done so,

286
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:02,770
the distance between the interphone beside the bed and the door of the room

287
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,570
is pretty far.

288
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,070
It's unthinkable that he'd have an attack

289
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:09,070
just because the killer opened the door.

290
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,670
Even if the killer were to have some kind of weapon on him,

291
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,570
if his hands were on the interphone,

292
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,470
he would probably have put his finger in the fingerprint recognition device

293
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,570
and opened the door.

294
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,370
What frightened him to the point of not even being able to do so?

295
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,270
What on earth could it be?

296
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:27,370
Let's go over all the incidents that happened so far.

297
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:31,170
Please start by telling me about the ship accident

298
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,270
that occurred 13 years ago off shore Suruga Bay.

299
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,070
Did anything out of the ordinary happen before it set sail?

300
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,370
I went to see everyone off at the harbour,

301
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,170
but nothing other than Mrs. Kunitomo's friend,

302
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:46,970
Mr. Sekiguchi suddenly participating happened.

303
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,570
Why did Mr. Sekiguchi suddenly decide to participate?

304
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:54,170
He had been wanting to go cruising with us from some time ago

305
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:57,070
and it just so happened that Namika and Shigeko came down with a cold

306
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,570
and the number of people boarding decreased.

307
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,070
If I were to mention something I thought was strange...

308
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:07,070
Mr. Sekiguchi was carrying a large bag.

309
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,670
And the contents?

310
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:14,370
I'm sure he said it was scuba diving equipment.

311
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,970
I see.

312
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,670
And the people that died back then were,

313
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:24,070
first of all, is the chef that used to work here, and Shieko's husband,

314
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,070
as well as Namika's father.

315
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:31,870
The second is Mr. Watabiki's father who worked here as a chauffeur.

316
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,870
The third is Mr. Watabiki's younger brother who happened to participate

317
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,970
and go on board.

318
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:42,770
And the fourth was your wife who worked here as a housekeeper, right?

319
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,170
Yes.

320
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:47,370
You said that Mr. and Mrs. Kunitomo and Mr. Sekiguchi

321
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:52,470
were the only ones who survived, but were there other boats on board?

322
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,370
There were, but we were so desperate to save ourselves

323
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,970
that I have no idea whether the others got on or not.

324
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,970
I'm not even sure whether an SOS was sent out either.

325
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,670
And after that,

326
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:08,170
your husband start having nightmares, almost got into a car accident,

327
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,370
this strange card was delivered,

328
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,770
the dish cabinet falls over in the middle of the night,

329
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,870
and you heard strange sounds in the house.

330
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:19,070
Did anyone here realize that these things were all happening

331
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,970
on the 4th of Butsumetsu?

332
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:25,970
Well, I did realize that it was always the 4th, but...

333
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:30,270
Maybe the master was aware.

334
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,270
He used to be hooked on the 6-day calendar, and he used to choose

335
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,170
lucky days marked on the calendar whenever going cruising.

336
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,870
And on the day before something was bound to happen,

337
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:41,070
he used to always invite Mr. Sekiguchi over.

338
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,870
Then was Mr. Sekiguchi at the house

339
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,270
when Mr. and Mrs. Kunitomo heard strange noises

340
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,470
in the house where no one else was supposed to be?

341
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,070
Yes.

342
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,870
Mrs. Kunimoto.

343
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,370
What kind of sound was it?

344
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,870
Let's see...

345
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,370
It sounded like something being hit against the wall,

346
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,470
like "thud", "thud".

347
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,270
And "slash", like leather being hit.

348
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,870
It's as if a ball is being hit against the wall

349
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,570
and being caught with a glove.

350
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,070
Is there anyone who plays baseball in this house?

351
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,470
I don't.

352
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,670
But my younger brother who died did.

353
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,870
Hey, hold it.

354
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:23,370
Don't tell me that it's a ghost after all.

355
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,070
What?

356
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,770
His nightmare is about the housekeeper that makes the bed.

357
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,470
The car accident is the chauffeur.

358
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,570
The dish cabinet is the chef.

359
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:37,270
And if the strange sound is baseball,

360
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:41,570
it all has to do with people who died 13 years ago.

361
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:46,370
Then don't tell me that the words that are written on the card,

362
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:50,070
"Atone your sins before I shall awaken. I am the fifth soul."

363
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,870
means the spirits of the dead are going to resurrect one after the other?

364
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,770
No!

365
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,470
Mrs. Kunitomo! Are you all right, Mrs. Kunitomo?

366
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,670
It's a curse after all.

367
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,470
This house is possessed by evil spirits.

368
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,070
Don't be ridiculous.

369
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,770
There are no such things as evil spirits in this world!

370
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,370
But a spirit could easily

371
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:16,370
go through the door with the fingerprint recognition device, couldn't it?

372
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:20,070
Right! I'm sure Mr. Kunitomo also saw that ghost!

373
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,970
No way!

374
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,170
Right, Inspector Yokomizo?

375
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,770
Well...

376
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:34,770
It's just that my cell phone rang at such good timing.

377
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,370
Yes. This is Yokomizo!

378
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,770
Gosh!

379
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,370
Oh, forensics?

380
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:43,770
What? Fingerprints were detected from the rope and medicine bottle?

381
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,370
Yes.

382
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,770
Yes. Then there's no mistake that the prints

383
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:52,770
are those of the person who last touched the bottle?

384
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,970
So it's the same as having already nabbed the killer!

385
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:59,570
Because all your fingerprints have already been taken.

386
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,870
And? Whose fingerprints did it match?

387
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:05,870
Well...

388
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,370
It doesn't match anyone who works in this house.

389
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,370
It's an unknown fingerprint.

390
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,470
What?

391
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,570
No way!

392
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:19,970
Then how did the killer get through that door?

393
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,570
I wonder?

394
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,170
Evil spirits.

395
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,270
It's the evil spirits after all.

396
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,170
Isn't it getting very interesting?

397
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,820
Next Conan's Hint:

398
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,340
"Siblings"

399
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,820
The next episode is finally the solution!

400
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,160
Or maybe it is the work of evil spirits after all.

401
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,600
-Hey! -I'm sorry.
