1
00:00:01,529 --> 00:00:04,829
"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:04,829 --> 00:00:07,429
What a slow day.

3
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:10,529
I wish an incident or something would occur

4
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:12,029
even from now.

5
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:14,829
Dad, what a thing to say, it's not nice.

6
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:17,729
Maybe I'll go get myself a drink.

7
00:00:17,729 --> 00:00:20,629
But, it doesn't look like it's going to stop raining.

8
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:26,529
It's Officer Chiba.

9
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:28,029
It's come!

10
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:29,529
A case.

11
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:32,929
Mr. Mouri, please take over.

12
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:34,329
Welcome.

13
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:36,429
Please find her right away.

14
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:40,129
We've got to hurry or her life may be in danger!

15
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:02,729
If all cases were men,

16
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,529
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

17
00:01:04,529 --> 00:01:06,329
There is a request from Officer Chiba to Pops.

18
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:08,429
A strange occurrence on a certain rainy night.

19
00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:10,029
He sees through the one and only truth.

20
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:11,929
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

21
00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:14,029
His name is Detective Conan!

22
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,840
"Rainy Night Blackmailer"

23
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,540
The fact is,

24
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,540
I have a woman that I see a lot at the coffee shop I frequent.

25
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,740
I got a call from her just a while ago asking for advice.

26
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,640
She says she feels that her life is in danger.

27
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,240
"I'll go see you after I get out of prison".

28
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,040
She says she receiving these types of letter several times a year.

29
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,240
Yes.

30
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,640
I'm so scared.

31
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,040
I changed my job and moved house too.

32
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,640
"Mio Ashida (23)" -But, recently I've been having this feeling

33
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,340
of being watched by someone.

34
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,040
I may just be imagining things but...

35
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,840
For the moment,

36
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,740
I told her to let me know immediately

37
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,340
if she sees the person or come up with any details.

38
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,440
But...

39
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:35,140
She left while I stood up to go the restroom.

40
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:41,040
She suddenly paid for the tab and left.

41
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,540
As if she were afraid of something.

42
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,540
Oh, no.

43
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,240
This is her umbrella.

44
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,040
She mistook hers for mine.

45
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,940
It felt more like intent to kill more than ill-doing.

46
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,640
Maybe the driver mistook me for her.

47
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,440
How careless of me.

48
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,240
I haven't asked her for her address yet.

49
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,740
I was thinking of talking this over with the Inspector too,

50
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,840
but I've got no concrete proof.

51
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,740
So I came here.

52
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,540
I don't really know if you can call this a case.

53
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,740
Besides, if you don't even know who she is,

54
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,640
how do you expect me to find her?

55
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,040
But, if you started seeing her a lot recently,

56
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,240
doesn't that mean she moved to somewhere near that coffee shop?

57
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,440
I see!

58
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,340
Then maybe it may be good to start looking for her,

59
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,540
expanding the range by first searching from where the coffee shop is.

60
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,040
I guess so.

61
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,240
Hey, hey. I don't have any intention of taking on this request...

62
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,640
Okay, I'll go, I'll go.

63
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,040
This criminal kind of pisses me off.

64
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,240
-Student who failed entrance exam... -Darn, the noise...

65
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,040
"Takuya Murakami" -The guys upstairs.

66
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,440
Don't! Somebody help me!

67
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,040
I was wondering if any incident happened?

68
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,140
What?

69
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,040
What seems to be the matter, Officer Chiba?

70
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,240
Yes, yes, I understand.

71
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,840
It seems that a young woman

72
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,140
became involved in a murder case in an apartment near here.

73
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,840
That car's from before.

74
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
What?

75
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,440
Too late?

76
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,440
Hey, wait, Chiba!

77
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,540
Move it!

78
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,340
-Chiba. -I thought it was your day off today.

79
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,840
She was killed, wasn't she?

80
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,940
Who is this man?

81
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,340
That cap and sunglasses.

82
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,340
From that time.

83
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,740
Mio?

84
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,540
She's not the victim?

85
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,140
She's the assaulter.

86
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,940
Inspector.

87
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,740
Mr. Mouri, what brings you here?

88
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,440
About that...

89
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,040
I see.

90
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,040
That's why you were looking for her?

91
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,040
Yes.

92
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,340
The car in the vacant lot was a stolen car after all.

93
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,440
I see.

94
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,840
What on earth happened?

95
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,840
Officer Takagi, explain the outline of the case for me, will you?

96
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,040
Yes, sir.

97
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,740
The incident occurred 40 minutes ago, at 9:30 pm.

98
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,540
Mr. Takuya Murakami, a student living right below the room,

99
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,440
hears a noise and scream and comes to check out his room,

100
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,740
where he finds the dead body and Mio Ashida standing next to it.

101
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,740
He then contacts the police using his cell phone.

102
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,740
At the time of discovery,

103
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,640
it seems that the entrance door was not locked.

104
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,840
The victim is Mr. Yoshizumi Karashima, age 28.

105
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,440
I confirmed that he got out of the prison for traffic offenders.

106
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,240
Prison for traffic offenders?

107
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,740
Was he imprisoned for a traffic accident?

108
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,740
That's right.

109
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,540
A year ago, a car went out of control

110
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,040
because the driver drove under the influence of alcohol.

111
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,340
The car crashes right through the guardrail and fell into the lake.

112
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,440
Out of the two who were thrown out of the window,

113
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,140
one died and one suffered only slight injury.

114
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,140
The driver who was charged for negligent driving

115
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,640
resulting in injury and death

116
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,440
was not indicted on terms of death of suspect.

117
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,040
The person that was riding in the same vehicle was charged

118
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,940
under the road traffic law for aiding and abetting drunk driving,

119
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,440
and served a 1 year sentence in prison.

120
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,840
That happened to be the victim of this incident, Mr. Karashima.

121
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,040
That's a lie!

122
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,440
My big brother, after being arrested for drunk driving in the past,

123
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,540
promised never to drive again.

124
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,940
Big brother?

125
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,440
Karashima was the one who was driving.

126
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,440
Mio.

127
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,540
The person who was driving and died

128
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,740
happened to be her older brother,

129
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,440
Mr. Toshiaki Ashida, age 28 back then.

130
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,540
I submitted a formal objection to Karashima's testimony

131
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,340
that my older brother was at the wheels at that time,

132
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,140
not being able to believe him.

133
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,040
But it was dismissed. And, yet...

134
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,240
A year in prison?

135
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,040
You must be joking.

136
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,140
It's because you guys submitted a objection!

137
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,840
You'll pay for this!

138
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,540
I won't let you get away with this!

139
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,740
It's a total spiteful counterattack!

140
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,740
Because he was sure he'd be getting a suspended sentence.

141
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,640
Mio, please give me your letters.

142
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,340
Yes, sir.

143
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,340
Are those letters that he wrote while he was in prison?

144
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,040
Each and every one of them mention

145
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,340
that he'll come to see her when he gets out.

146
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,140
Although it's not written all that clearly,

147
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,640
this is obviously blackmail.

148
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,440
It seems to be so.

149
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,440
It's true that it looks to be so, but...

150
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,940
"I'd like you to not forget me and wait for me..."

151
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,240
What could this mean?

152
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,840
Why is the date on this almost 6 months apart?

153
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,740
Maybe the rage that he once felt subsided for a while,

154
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,240
but with the coming of the end of his sentence,

155
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,440
his rage must've built up again?

156
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,140
Hey, keep out of this kid!

157
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,240
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,840
Mio, afraid that Karashima was soon coming out,

159
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,440
you changed jobs and moved to this apartment, right?

160
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,540
Yes.

161
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,740
I see.

162
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,740
You just moved, that's why you furniture

163
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,240
and electrical appliances are still new?

164
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,640
There are ones that you haven't used at all yet.

165
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,740
Come to think of it, that's true.

166
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,340
There are price tags on them too.

167
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,140
That's because all I did was come home and sleep.

168
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,940
At any rate, I was scared.

169
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,240
I would think so. I understand.

170
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,740
But, it doesn't look as if she's lived here at all.

171
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,940
The TV was being watched

172
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,040
although the remote controller didn't look to have been used.

173
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,140
I don't know how or where he found out,

174
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:24,940
but when you got home the lock was forced open.

175
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,240
When I came home,

176
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,040
the room light was on,

177
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,140
and they door was unlocked.

178
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,640
But, I didn't think I was being ambushed,

179
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,540
and when I opened the door, I was suddenly...

180
00:10:42,373 --> 00:10:45,473
Ashida fought back with the umbrella she had.

181
00:10:45,473 --> 00:10:48,073
They struggled and moved on to the living room.

182
00:10:55,373 --> 00:10:58,273
The fatal wound was the blow to his head.

183
00:11:01,673 --> 00:11:04,373
He also has a wound on his nose.

184
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:07,673
Maybe he hit it while struggling with her.

185
00:11:07,673 --> 00:11:08,673
See.

186
00:11:08,673 --> 00:11:11,473
The corner of the TV stand.

187
00:11:11,473 --> 00:11:14,473
It seems definite that he bumped into this.

188
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:15,773
But...

189
00:11:15,773 --> 00:11:19,273
It is very likely that this case is manslaughter in self-defense.

190
00:11:20,773 --> 00:11:23,273
Not knowing that she had mistakenly taken my umbrella,

191
00:11:23,273 --> 00:11:26,373
he could've also tried to hit-and-run me.

192
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:31,473
This is...

193
00:11:33,873 --> 00:11:36,173
The victim's shoes.

194
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:39,673
Ran, what time did it start raining from?

195
00:11:39,673 --> 00:11:40,673
I wonder...

196
00:11:40,673 --> 00:11:44,073
It started at night, so maybe it was around 7:00 pm?

197
00:11:44,073 --> 00:11:45,673
Which means...

198
00:11:50,373 --> 00:11:52,573
Then, I guess we'll be on our way.

199
00:11:52,573 --> 00:11:55,273
I'll get the details from you at the station.

200
00:11:55,273 --> 00:11:56,573
Yes, sir.

201
00:11:56,573 --> 00:11:57,873
Don't worry.

202
00:11:57,873 --> 00:11:59,673
I'll back you up.

203
00:11:59,673 --> 00:12:01,573
No need to worry.

204
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:04,173
Thank you very much.

205
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:06,473
Like I've been saying...

206
00:12:06,473 --> 00:12:08,573
And like I told the detective too,

207
00:12:08,573 --> 00:12:11,473
the sound of the TV was on all the while.

208
00:12:11,473 --> 00:12:13,573
And, by the way, who are you?

209
00:12:13,573 --> 00:12:16,873
I was asked by the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri,

210
00:12:16,873 --> 00:12:18,273
who's upstairs now.

211
00:12:18,273 --> 00:12:22,073
And, since when did you hear the sound of the TV from?

212
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:24,173
From around 6:00 pm.

213
00:12:24,173 --> 00:12:27,773
But, it switched off about 9:30 pm, and that's when I heard the scream.

214
00:12:27,773 --> 00:12:29,873
Although this place looks pretty fancy on first glance,

215
00:12:29,873 --> 00:12:31,673
but it's a cheap apartment,

216
00:12:31,673 --> 00:12:33,673
so sound proofing is the pits.

217
00:12:33,673 --> 00:12:36,373
Did you hear any other sound beside that of the TV?

218
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:39,073
Come to think of it...

219
00:12:39,073 --> 00:12:40,773
Darn, the noise...

220
00:12:40,773 --> 00:12:42,173
The guy upstairs.

221
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,273
Don't!

222
00:12:46,273 --> 00:12:47,773
I see.

223
00:12:48,873 --> 00:12:50,173
Which means...

224
00:12:58,373 --> 00:13:00,573
Just as I thought.

225
00:13:00,573 --> 00:13:04,273
Then, the truth of this case is...

226
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:13,169
Go ahead.

227
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:17,269
Okay, I guess I'll go home and drink some beer...

228
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:18,669
What's that?

229
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,269
It... it's come again, Mr. Mouri.

230
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:25,569
Dad?

231
00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:28,469
Mr. Mouri, don't tell me that...

232
00:13:28,469 --> 00:13:29,869
Officer Takagi,

233
00:13:29,869 --> 00:13:32,069
I want you to check on something immediately.

234
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:33,469
Yes.

235
00:13:33,469 --> 00:13:34,869
Inspector.

236
00:13:34,869 --> 00:13:36,969
We have reached a conclusion yet.

237
00:13:41,369 --> 00:13:43,669
Yes. Yes.

238
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:46,069
About when was this?

239
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:48,269
What do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

240
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:52,769
Inspector, this is not manslaughter in self defense

241
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:55,269
but undoubtedly a schemed homicide.

242
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:56,869
Schemed homicide?

243
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,469
Oh, no. That's ridiculous.

244
00:13:59,469 --> 00:14:01,669
Let me explain.

245
00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:04,069
Please look at the umbrella stand at the front entrance.

246
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:06,169
There should be rain water inside it.

247
00:14:07,469 --> 00:14:08,969
True.

248
00:14:08,969 --> 00:14:10,969
The umbrellas that we brought,

249
00:14:10,969 --> 00:14:14,469
are left outside in order to preserve the site.

250
00:14:14,469 --> 00:14:18,269
If so, there should only be one umbrella in this room.

251
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:20,269
Yes, the umbrella that she had brought home

252
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:22,369
from the coffee shop by mistake.

253
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:24,369
Officer Chiba's umbrella.

254
00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:27,269
It's true but if so then what?

255
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:29,569
That means, the umbrella in the umbrella stand

256
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,169
should also be that umbrella.

257
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:32,669
If so,

258
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:35,269
her testimony that she was suddenly attacked

259
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:37,169
by the victim who forced opened the door

260
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:39,669
and broke into her room is inconsistent.

261
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:41,169
True.

262
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:42,369
She wouldn't have had the time

263
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:44,669
to put her umbrella into the umbrella stand.

264
00:14:44,669 --> 00:14:47,269
There is still another inconsistency.

265
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:49,069
Despite the victim parking his car in the vacant lot

266
00:14:49,069 --> 00:14:51,269
and coming over here,

267
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:53,869
his clothes are not wet at all.

268
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:55,969
It was because he used an umbrella.

269
00:14:55,969 --> 00:14:58,669
But just a while ago, you said there were no other umbrellas.

270
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:00,769
In other words,

271
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:03,069
the victim came into this room

272
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:06,569
before it began to rain, which was about 7:00 pm.

273
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:07,869
Ridiculous.

274
00:15:07,869 --> 00:15:11,469
I was almost hit-and-run only about 1 hour ago.

275
00:15:11,469 --> 00:15:13,769
Right. The shoes.

276
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:16,469
Weren't the victim's shoes wet?

277
00:15:16,469 --> 00:15:18,769
It's true that his shoes are wet.

278
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:20,269
However,

279
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:24,569
why aren't the socks and pants of the victim wet?

280
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:26,369
Well...

281
00:15:26,369 --> 00:15:29,169
However, inside the possessions of the victim,

282
00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:32,669
the cap and the sunglasses that the driver of the car was wearing were.

283
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:36,669
How can you conclusively say that they were the belongings of the victim?

284
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:40,269
There is another inconsistency.

285
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:43,569
The position of the seat of that car.

286
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:46,269
I had Conan confirm just a while ago,

287
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:48,069
that the position of the seat was a bit too close

288
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:49,669
to the steering wheel

289
00:15:49,669 --> 00:15:52,569
for a big guy like the victim to be driving it.

290
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:55,769
Although everything till now is circumstantial evidence,

291
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:59,569
there is only one conclusion that we will arrive to...

292
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:01,969
That this case is not a case of self-defense,

293
00:16:01,969 --> 00:16:05,369
but schemed homicide committed by Mio.

294
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,169
Mio.

295
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:15,369
Everything was schemed by Mio to begin with.

296
00:16:15,369 --> 00:16:17,069
Let me explain it to you in order.

297
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:22,769
After placing a trace of the door having been picked,

298
00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:25,269
Mio called Mr. Karashima by phone.

299
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:29,369
She tells him to wait for her inside because the door is unlocked.

300
00:16:29,369 --> 00:16:31,069
Next she shows Officer Chiba

301
00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:33,569
the letters she had received from Mr. Karashima.

302
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:35,169
And, shows him that she is afraid

303
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:37,269
because she is being threatened.

304
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:40,769
Then she deliberately takes Officer Chiba's umbrella and leaves the shop.

305
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:44,069
When Officer Chiba goes after her, she attacks him using her car,

306
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,669
in an attempt to leave an impression on him

307
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:47,969
that someone is coming after her life.

308
00:16:48,969 --> 00:16:49,969
In the meantime,

309
00:16:49,969 --> 00:16:53,069
Mr. Karashima who gets to her room before it begins to rain,

310
00:16:53,069 --> 00:16:56,869
and waits for her return watches TV.

311
00:16:56,869 --> 00:16:58,569
And since he couldn't use the remote controller,

312
00:16:58,569 --> 00:17:00,569
he manually turned the TV on.

313
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:03,969
Mio returns home at 9:30 pm.

314
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:06,869
Mr. Karashima turns off the TV he had been watching.

315
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:09,969
He kneels down and manually turns off the TV.

316
00:17:09,969 --> 00:17:13,069
He is attacked from behind with a vase,

317
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:16,169
lurches forward and hits his nose on the TV stand

318
00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:22,169
Mr. Murakami who lives on the first floor heard this noise.

319
00:17:23,469 --> 00:17:24,969
After that Mio,

320
00:17:24,969 --> 00:17:27,469
made Mr. Karashima's hand grab the knife,

321
00:17:27,469 --> 00:17:31,669
then left the cap and sunglasses she used when she attacked Officer Chiba,

322
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:33,769
back in the room.

323
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:36,269
What about the scream that Mr. Murakami heard?

324
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:39,569
Of course Mio acted it out on her own.

325
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:41,569
This terrible sound proofing

326
00:17:41,569 --> 00:17:44,569
is probably the very reason why she moved into this apartment.

327
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:46,369
However, all the other sounds

328
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:48,469
while the murder was being committed were heard too.

329
00:17:48,469 --> 00:17:52,069
All of what you're saying is based on assumption, Mr. Mouri.

330
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:55,569
But, it is a fact that the victim was threatening Mio.

331
00:17:55,569 --> 00:17:58,169
The vicious remarks in court and letters are proof of this.

332
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:00,069
Is it really so?

333
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:04,169
It's true what happened in court.

334
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:06,369
But, how about the letters?

335
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:08,869
In the letters that stopped coming for a while

336
00:18:08,869 --> 00:18:11,369
and then started to come again, especially, his remark,

337
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:14,869
"I'll go see you after I get out of prison", and...

338
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:18,869
"I want to tell you the truth, so I'd like to see you,"

339
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:21,269
keeps coming out repeatedly.

340
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:24,169
Maybe he was planning to confess

341
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,769
that during the accident that happened a year ago,

342
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:29,769
"I was the one who was actually driving".

343
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:31,569
It... it can't be.

344
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,869
It's not easy to believe.

345
00:18:33,869 --> 00:18:38,869
Then, why didn't he confess that it was so to the police or in court?

346
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:41,969
Maybe he thought he didn't have time?

347
00:18:41,969 --> 00:18:44,369
Officer Takagi, where were you?

348
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:47,469
I had him go to the traffic violations prison to check out

349
00:18:47,469 --> 00:18:50,769
why his letters stopped coming for a while because that bothered me.

350
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:53,269
A while before his letters stopped,

351
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:56,069
Mr. Karashima was found to have a serious disease

352
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:58,969
after undergoing a medical examination within prison.

353
00:18:58,969 --> 00:19:01,869
He was given six more months to live.

354
00:19:01,869 --> 00:19:03,069
What?

355
00:19:03,069 --> 00:19:05,069
However, he didn't show up at the hospital

356
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:09,769
he was told to go to after getting out either.

357
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:13,569
I think that he was probably looking for you

358
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,369
who quit your job and moved, Mio.

359
00:19:16,369 --> 00:19:19,469
Which means he really meant to confess what he did?

360
00:19:19,469 --> 00:19:21,369
That's a lie! I can't believe that!

361
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:24,369
Even if it were to be so, I would never forgive him.

362
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:27,769
No matter who forgives him, I would never!

363
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:29,169
Mio.

364
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,169
My big brother died in that manner

365
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:33,669
and my engagement was cancelled.

366
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:36,269
My father had no choice but to quit his job,

367
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:38,869
got depressed, fell ill and died.

368
00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:42,469
My mother died soon after as if to go after him.

369
00:19:42,469 --> 00:19:45,269
Nobody helped us.

370
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:48,269
Nobody believed my big brother's innocence.

371
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:49,669
That's why...

372
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:51,869
You took revenge, didn't you?

373
00:19:51,869 --> 00:19:54,169
Yes, exactly.

374
00:19:54,169 --> 00:19:56,869
Don't tell me that you're going to admit to your crime.

375
00:19:56,869 --> 00:20:00,169
Yes. I hate to go over your head, Mr. famous detective,

376
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:02,469
who could only gather circumstantial evidence till now,

377
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:05,669
but I have no regrets.

378
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:08,069
No regrets what so ever!

379
00:20:08,069 --> 00:20:09,469
Mio.

380
00:20:10,469 --> 00:20:12,269
Then, I shall tell you not the circumstantial evidence

381
00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:15,869
but the truth that I have come to...

382
00:20:17,569 --> 00:20:19,569
If you learn of this truth,

383
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:23,169
you will realize that you have done is totally meaningless.

384
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:25,669
Rather, although there is no murder

385
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:27,869
that has any meaning in this world.

386
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:29,569
Just what do you mean?

387
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:32,769
Instead of me explaining it, let me re-enact it. Conan!

388
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:34,069
Yes.

389
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:36,669
You act as Mr. Karashima,

390
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,369
and you act out her, Officer Chiba.

391
00:20:39,369 --> 00:20:41,769
Inspector Megure, will you turn on the TV?

392
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,669
Well Pitcher Maeda was fantastic today, wasn't he?

393
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:46,869
Then, Officer Chiba,

394
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:49,269
please fling up the murder weapon.

395
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:50,369
Like this?

396
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:54,069
Mio, please stay as you are, and turn off the TV.

397
00:20:57,569 --> 00:21:00,069
This is...

398
00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:02,869
Mr. Karashima saw you,

399
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:05,269
but he didn't try to avoid you.

400
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:14,669
The only possible deduction

401
00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:17,369
is that he knowingly fell into your vicious plans to kill him.

402
00:21:18,469 --> 00:21:19,469
Right.

403
00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:21,569
He was actually full of regret

404
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:23,669
from the bottom of his heart.

405
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:25,469
Even after hearing this,

406
00:21:25,469 --> 00:21:28,269
do you still really not have any regrets?

407
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:51,769
There's no doubt that through this incident,

408
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:56,469
there will be a reconsideration of the accident that occur a year ago.

409
00:22:56,469 --> 00:22:59,769
However, the life that was taken will not come back,

410
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:02,369
nor will the crime that was committed be erased.

411
00:23:05,369 --> 00:23:08,869
I couldn't do anything after all.

412
00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:10,269
I'm sorry.

413
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:12,269
Don't get conceited.

414
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:15,969
I just took advantage of you

415
00:23:15,969 --> 00:23:18,669
because the police doing nothing for me a year ago.

416
00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:24,269
But, if I found you earlier and changed the umbrella,

417
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,669
it's highly likely

418
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:28,569
that you wouldn't have committed the crime at least tonight.

419
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:34,269
Either way, I don't deserve protection under your umbrella.

420
00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:35,269
Mio.

421
00:23:36,969 --> 00:23:38,269
I'm sorry.

422
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:40,969
Thank you.

423
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:47,169
This time it's her turn to compensate.

424
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:50,669
But, I'm sure that Officer Chiba's feelings got through to her.

425
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:55,269
Yeah, I'm sure.
