1
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:05,331
Officer Takagi went off

2
00:00:05,331 --> 00:00:08,331
"Meet with parents" -without telling anyone where he was going.

3
00:00:08,331 --> 00:00:11,731
Do you know Officer Wataru Takagi, children?

4
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:13,993
Yes, we do. But why?

5
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:15,995
I couldn't have asked for better.

6
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:20,931
He asked me to hand this over to his detective girlfriend.

7
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:24,003
Could you do so for me?

8
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:25,231
He said that it's perishable,

9
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:27,331
so open it as soon as you can.

10
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:29,231
He also said that it will be no good

11
00:00:29,231 --> 00:00:32,011
by tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

12
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:34,013
We opened the package

13
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:37,031
and found a tablet computer inside it.

14
00:00:37,031 --> 00:00:39,731
When we switched it on, the screen displayed...

15
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:44,023
Officer Takagi?

16
00:00:46,331 --> 00:00:48,331
While continuing investigations

17
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:50,831
to identify the location where Officer Takagi is,

18
00:00:50,831 --> 00:00:53,531
three people who are likely connected emerged.

19
00:00:53,531 --> 00:00:56,631
The person thought to be the culprit was identified,

20
00:00:56,631 --> 00:00:59,131
and the police headed over to where he might be hiding.

21
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:02,031
Finally.

22
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:05,431
You've finally found me.

23
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:07,731
While waiting for you, I was about to doze off

24
00:01:07,731 --> 00:01:11,031
and accidentally push the switch of the bomb.

25
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:14,331
Okay, now talk.

26
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:16,055
Tell us where Officer Takagi is.

27
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:17,431
I see.

28
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:21,531
Just like he said, you're quite a beauty.

29
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:26,065
But it doesn't mean he's right for dumping Natalie...

30
00:01:28,431 --> 00:01:32,071
Now, listen well before I knock you over!

31
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:34,631
The man you kidnapped is Wataru Takagi,

32
00:01:34,631 --> 00:01:37,031
and Natalie's boyfriend was Wataru Date!

33
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:39,431
Besides, she wasn't dumped!

34
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:42,081
But in a mail that she sent out, she said

35
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:43,831
that Wataru wouldn't come anymore!

36
00:01:43,831 --> 00:01:45,531
Of course, he wouldn't!

37
00:01:45,531 --> 00:01:47,431
It was because he was run over by a car

38
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:48,831
and passed away that day!

39
00:01:48,831 --> 00:01:51,031
That... That can't be!

40
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:54,531
So, hurry up and tell us where Officer Takagi is.

41
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:00,531
Don't tell me...

42
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:02,631
Don't tell me that there was poison in the wine?

43
00:02:02,631 --> 00:02:03,831
Hang on!

44
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:05,331
He is...

45
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:07,131
Where? Where is he?

46
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:09,531
-Hurry up and tell me! -He...

47
00:02:13,731 --> 00:02:15,631
Where is he?

48
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:18,117
In the meantime, Officer Takagi finally succeeded

49
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:20,631
in cutting the rope tied onto his feet,

50
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:23,131
and dropped the sheet that was near his feet

51
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:24,431
and finds...

52
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:27,031
That's...

53
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:29,731
Wait a second! What's that?

54
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:33,931
-A bomb? -What?

55
00:02:39,131 --> 00:02:40,831
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

56
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:42,731
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

57
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:44,143
Officer Takagi's in a pinch!

58
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,145
His energy is running out, and so is time limit for the bomb!

59
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:48,147
He sees through the one and only truth.

60
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:49,931
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

61
00:02:49,931 --> 00:02:52,731
His name is Detective Conan!

62
00:04:34,724 --> 00:04:39,924
"A Life Risking Love Broadcast (Raid)"

63
00:04:44,424 --> 00:04:46,624
Something that looks like a timer is in view.

64
00:04:46,624 --> 00:04:48,724
A time bomb?

65
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:51,024
Hey, Shiratori.

66
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,273
Do you know the time when Ms. Natalie committed suicide?

67
00:04:54,524 --> 00:04:56,824
If I remember correctly, the estimated time of death

68
00:04:56,824 --> 00:04:58,824
was around 10.00 am.

69
00:04:58,824 --> 00:05:03,224
Hey, tomorrow will be the same day she died a year ago.

70
00:05:03,224 --> 00:05:07,624
If the timer is set to explode at that time...

71
00:05:07,624 --> 00:05:11,424
So no matter what we do, Takagi will be blown up

72
00:05:11,424 --> 00:05:13,824
in less than 18 hours from now?

73
00:05:13,824 --> 00:05:16,724
-Oh, no... -Hey, wait!

74
00:05:16,724 --> 00:05:19,924
The masking tape securing the bomb is about to peel off,

75
00:05:19,924 --> 00:05:21,224
and it looks like it's about to fall off any minute now!

76
00:05:27,024 --> 00:05:28,307
Darn it.

77
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:29,924
Officer Takagi!

78
00:05:29,924 --> 00:05:31,124
Don't worry.

79
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:32,311
Officer Takagi has realized it,

80
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:34,024
and he's trying to drop it with his feet.

81
00:05:34,024 --> 00:05:36,315
-Go for it, Takagi! -Just a bit more!

82
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:37,924
Drop it!

83
00:05:42,524 --> 00:05:44,624
He put it on the board.

84
00:05:44,624 --> 00:05:46,624
What are you doing, Takagi?

85
00:05:46,624 --> 00:05:48,924
-Somebody's there. -Huh?

86
00:05:48,924 --> 00:05:51,324
Officer Takagi heard somebody's voice from below,

87
00:05:51,324 --> 00:05:53,524
so he didn't drop it.

88
00:05:53,524 --> 00:05:56,335
The audio from the tablet has been disabled, hasn't it?

89
00:05:56,524 --> 00:06:00,324
In spite of that, Officer Takagi's mouth is sealed with masking tape.

90
00:06:00,324 --> 00:06:01,924
This means that he's in a place

91
00:06:01,924 --> 00:06:05,224
where his voice could be heard by passersby.

92
00:06:05,224 --> 00:06:11,624
So, Officer Takagi did what he did to protect the people there.

93
00:06:11,624 --> 00:06:13,324
Takagi...

94
00:06:13,324 --> 00:06:16,024
I wonder who will be number one tomorrow?

95
00:06:16,024 --> 00:06:18,357
Of course, it's dad!

96
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:21,124
Because he's the strongest!

97
00:06:23,524 --> 00:06:26,124
The strongest...

98
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:28,924
Officer Date, you are definitely strong to be able

99
00:06:28,924 --> 00:06:32,371
to take such a huge suspect into custody just like that.

100
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:36,024
I heard that you were the top in the police school too, right?

101
00:06:36,024 --> 00:06:39,524
Oh, come on. That rumor is rubbish.

102
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,624
I always placed second.

103
00:06:41,624 --> 00:06:43,224
I could never outdo him,

104
00:06:43,224 --> 00:06:46,724
be it physically or mentally.

105
00:06:46,724 --> 00:06:47,824
"Him"?

106
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,024
He was a kind and lanky guy like you.

107
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:54,024
I wonder where he is and what he's doing now.

108
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:56,395
Maybe he's dropped dead somewhere

109
00:06:56,395 --> 00:07:00,399
because he was overconfident about himself.

110
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,124
You'd better be careful, too.

111
00:07:02,124 --> 00:07:05,424
Although we're officers, we've only got one life.

112
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:08,824
Don't risk your life on something unworthy.

113
00:07:10,624 --> 00:07:11,924
Officer Date.

114
00:07:15,124 --> 00:07:17,324
We should narrow down the place

115
00:07:17,324 --> 00:07:20,419
where Officer Takagi is to Hokkaido?

116
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:22,124
Why is that, Conan?

117
00:07:22,124 --> 00:07:24,824
Because the crow in the image with Officer Takagi

118
00:07:24,824 --> 00:07:27,324
is probably a Western jackdaw.

119
00:07:27,324 --> 00:07:31,124
Western jackdaws are usually found in Europe,

120
00:07:31,124 --> 00:07:34,224
but they were found twice in Japan in the past.

121
00:07:34,224 --> 00:07:37,424
And both times, they were found in Hokkaido!

122
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:41,224
But that's not enough to conclude that his location is in Hokkaido.

123
00:07:41,224 --> 00:07:42,441
-Hey. -What?

124
00:07:42,624 --> 00:07:44,024
What is that light?

125
00:07:44,024 --> 00:07:46,224
I wonder, too.

126
00:07:46,224 --> 00:07:47,624
What is it?

127
00:07:47,624 --> 00:07:49,024
Over here.

128
00:07:49,024 --> 00:07:50,924
There is a thin pillar of light

129
00:07:50,924 --> 00:07:53,724
in the sky behind Officer Takagi.

130
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,824
The sun pillar phenomenon.

131
00:07:55,824 --> 00:07:57,624
At dawn and sundown,

132
00:07:57,624 --> 00:08:02,224
if sunlight is reflected in the diamond dust in the air,

133
00:08:02,224 --> 00:08:05,224
it will look like a shining pillar.

134
00:08:05,224 --> 00:08:08,467
It is written on the internet that it is only seen

135
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:09,924
in cold places like Hokkaido.

136
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:13,724
Hey, do you mean Takagi is in such a cold place?

137
00:08:13,724 --> 00:08:16,224
We've got to rescue him quickly, then!

138
00:08:16,224 --> 00:08:18,477
He'll freeze to death!

139
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:21,824
Hey. Do you know what temperature

140
00:08:21,824 --> 00:08:23,024
causes the diamond dust to form?

141
00:08:23,024 --> 00:08:24,483
If I remember correctly,

142
00:08:24,724 --> 00:08:27,024
it's 20 degrees Celcius below the freezing point.

143
00:08:27,024 --> 00:08:29,524
Minus 20 degrees Celcius?

144
00:08:29,524 --> 00:08:31,624
It looks to be a quite a distance away,

145
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:33,524
so there's no guarantee that Officer Takagi

146
00:08:33,524 --> 00:08:35,124
is right where it happened.

147
00:08:35,124 --> 00:08:37,924
It's certain that he's somewhere nearby though.

148
00:08:37,924 --> 00:08:40,499
Superintendent...

149
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:43,524
It's Hokkaido!

150
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:48,024
I've confirmed that Hokkaido is where Takagi is being confined!

151
00:08:48,024 --> 00:08:50,924
Ask for help from the Hokkaido police

152
00:08:50,924 --> 00:08:52,824
and contact all the construction companies

153
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,424
as well as the demolishers!

154
00:08:55,424 --> 00:08:57,624
Ask them to re-investigate!

155
00:08:57,624 --> 00:08:59,024
Yes, sir...

156
00:08:59,024 --> 00:09:00,519
Let's go.

157
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:04,124
Megure! You shall fly to Hokkaido with Sato!

158
00:09:04,124 --> 00:09:07,124
Judging from the word "friend" that was written in the mail,

159
00:09:07,124 --> 00:09:10,324
an accomplice of the suspect may be at the site.

160
00:09:10,324 --> 00:09:12,224
Don't forget to bring your gun and cell phone!

161
00:09:12,224 --> 00:09:13,524
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

162
00:09:14,524 --> 00:09:16,535
Hold on, Takagi.

163
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:19,324
Just hang on a little while more.

164
00:09:27,924 --> 00:09:29,724
Thank you.

165
00:09:43,224 --> 00:09:44,924
But something's strange.

166
00:09:44,924 --> 00:09:47,224
They said they were checking all buildings

167
00:09:47,224 --> 00:09:49,224
that have over four stories in Hokkaido,

168
00:09:49,224 --> 00:09:51,724
so why haven't they found it yet?

169
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,524
If the culprit had a lot of friends,

170
00:09:53,524 --> 00:09:55,124
and they set the place up on their own,

171
00:09:55,124 --> 00:09:56,924
then it would be a different story.

172
00:09:56,924 --> 00:09:58,577
If they asked a construction company to do it,

173
00:09:58,577 --> 00:09:59,924
a building with four or more stories

174
00:09:59,924 --> 00:10:02,581
shouldn't be that difficult to find.

175
00:10:04,124 --> 00:10:05,824
Besides, it also bothers me

176
00:10:05,824 --> 00:10:08,124
that Officer Takagi dropped the sheet below.

177
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:10,589
It's true that someone who passed by the site

178
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:14,324
could've heard the sound of the sheet that fell.

179
00:10:14,324 --> 00:10:17,124
But if the police memo book that he dropped the night before

180
00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:20,024
is covered by the sheet, everything would go to waste.

181
00:10:20,824 --> 00:10:22,924
Maybe...

182
00:10:22,924 --> 00:10:25,424
he had another reason for doing so.

183
00:10:27,224 --> 00:10:29,224
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

184
00:10:29,224 --> 00:10:31,224
You were recording Officer Takagi's image

185
00:10:31,224 --> 00:10:33,424
with your cell phone, weren't you?

186
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,724
Yes, I did.

187
00:10:35,724 --> 00:10:37,424
Show it to me!

188
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:43,324
Don't tell me that the place where Officer Takagi is being confined...

189
00:10:45,524 --> 00:10:47,024
Don't tell me that...

190
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:59,392
Hey, Megure. Haven't you found Takagi yet?

191
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,639
No, sir.

192
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,092
The prefectural headquarter choppers are helping us search for him, too.

193
00:11:04,092 --> 00:11:06,392
But we've got to narrow down the location a bit more,

194
00:11:06,392 --> 00:11:07,692
or it'll be difficult...

195
00:11:07,692 --> 00:11:10,649
Have you received any report on your side?

196
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:11,792
No.

197
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:14,653
We had them re-investigate after dawn,

198
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:18,992
but no four-storey building as the one seen on the tablet

199
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:21,392
where Takagi could be has been found yet.

200
00:11:21,392 --> 00:11:23,892
Is... Is Takagi all right?

201
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,092
Yeah.

202
00:11:25,092 --> 00:11:28,092
It looks as if he's about to die any minute though.

203
00:11:28,092 --> 00:11:33,192
Maybe we should consider places other than Hokkaido at this point.

204
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,673
What is it? What happened?

205
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:37,692
Snow... It just started to snow!

206
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:40,192
Superintendent! How is it over there?

207
00:11:40,192 --> 00:11:41,892
Is there any snow on Officer Takagi's image?

208
00:11:41,892 --> 00:11:44,292
There's snow here, too!

209
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:46,685
Confirm with the meteorological agency! Hurry!

210
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:47,992
Yes, sir!

211
00:11:47,992 --> 00:11:49,692
Superintendent!

212
00:11:49,692 --> 00:11:51,792
We've only got less than an hour

213
00:11:51,792 --> 00:11:53,692
until the expected time of explosion of the place of confinement!

214
00:11:53,692 --> 00:11:55,692
I know that!

215
00:11:55,692 --> 00:11:58,697
Superintendent! It's only snowing in Hokkaido!

216
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:02,292
They said it started to snow in most areas in Hokkaido.

217
00:12:02,292 --> 00:12:05,692
So, Takagi's being confined somewhere in Hokkaido after all.

218
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:07,192
But how?

219
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:09,292
We already checked all buildings which are four stories or taller

220
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:11,492
in the entire prefecture, and yet...

221
00:12:11,492 --> 00:12:12,711
why can't we find him?

222
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:15,092
That's because it's less than four stories tall.

223
00:12:15,092 --> 00:12:16,192
What?

224
00:12:16,192 --> 00:12:18,492
The culprit used a trick

225
00:12:18,492 --> 00:12:21,592
to make the site of confinement appear to be more than four stories tall.

226
00:12:21,592 --> 00:12:24,392
I came here because Conan said that he realized something

227
00:12:24,392 --> 00:12:27,192
after looking at the image of Takagi yesterday.

228
00:12:28,892 --> 00:12:32,731
I stayed up all night analyzing that image,

229
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:35,492
and finally found the evidence.

230
00:12:35,492 --> 00:12:38,737
But we also watched that image

231
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:40,392
until there was nothing else to check,

232
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:41,492
and couldn't find anything.

233
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:44,743
I wonder if the shaky image was checked?

234
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:45,992
The image that was shaking?

235
00:12:45,992 --> 00:12:48,392
The one where the crow perched on the stick

236
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,492
or whatever the camera was attached to.

237
00:12:50,492 --> 00:12:52,292
This is the image.

238
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:54,753
Since the camera swayed and moved a bit out of place,

239
00:12:54,992 --> 00:12:56,755
we fast forwarded it and checked.

240
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:59,992
See. Take a good look at this image.

241
00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:02,761
Near Officer Takagi's left shoulder.

242
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:04,763
Something's here, right?

243
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:06,765
Something that looks like a hook.

244
00:13:08,092 --> 00:13:10,292
That... That's true.

245
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:11,892
But what on earth is it?

246
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:15,692
A hook that is on the tip of the string of the police memo book.

247
00:13:15,692 --> 00:13:19,292
So, this is the police memo book that Takagi dropped.

248
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:21,792
But isn't it in a weird position?

249
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:25,192
Yeah. It looks as if it's floating in the air or something.

250
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:28,792
It's not afloat. It's sitting on something.

251
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:31,492
It's on a mirror.

252
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:34,092
A mirror?

253
00:13:34,092 --> 00:13:37,992
That's why Officer Takagi dropped the police memo book.

254
00:13:37,992 --> 00:13:40,799
He wanted us to see through this mirror trick.

255
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,792
Unfortunately, it got hidden under the board.

256
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:47,892
He dropped the sheet that was covering the board

257
00:13:47,892 --> 00:13:49,792
for the same reason.

258
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:50,809
In other words,

259
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:54,192
the bottom part of the front view of the image was a mirrored image.

260
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:57,292
Which means the place is only about two stories high.

261
00:13:57,292 --> 00:14:00,392
Yeah. The fact that Officer Takagi is still alive

262
00:14:00,392 --> 00:14:01,892
proves that, too.

263
00:14:01,892 --> 00:14:04,292
The fact that he's alive is the proof?

264
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:05,692
Don't you get it?

265
00:14:05,692 --> 00:14:07,092
The sun pillar phenomenon only occurs

266
00:14:07,092 --> 00:14:10,192
at a temperature of 20 degrees Celcius below freezing point.

267
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:12,831
If a person wearing only a suit top is left in a place

268
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:16,092
where such a phenomenon can be seen,

269
00:14:16,092 --> 00:14:19,092
it won't take him even a day to freeze to death.

270
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:22,292
Then, why is Officer Takagi still...

271
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:25,492
An electrically heated wire is placed behind the mirror.

272
00:14:25,492 --> 00:14:29,392
It's to melt the snow so that it doesn't accumulate.

273
00:14:29,392 --> 00:14:30,849
Right, Doc?

274
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:32,192
Yeah.

275
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:33,392
If the snow accumulates,

276
00:14:33,392 --> 00:14:35,992
it'll give away the fact that there's a mirror.

277
00:14:35,992 --> 00:14:38,857
Well, thanks to the heat, the temperature rose slightly,

278
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:41,892
and it was a blessing for Officer Takagi.

279
00:14:41,892 --> 00:14:43,192
Okay!

280
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:46,492
Change the investigation area to two-storey buildings!

281
00:14:46,492 --> 00:14:47,592
If it's two stories,

282
00:14:47,592 --> 00:14:50,092
it's highly probable that it could be a house, too!

283
00:14:50,092 --> 00:14:52,871
Notify the Prefectural police headquarters

284
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:54,873
to check on renovators, too!

285
00:14:54,873 --> 00:14:55,792
Yes, sir...

286
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:59,692
Megure, the site is probably a house where the roof's been blown off!

287
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:01,892
It'll be easier to find from the sky!

288
00:15:01,892 --> 00:15:04,492
There's probably only 40 minutes left before the explosion.

289
00:15:04,492 --> 00:15:07,992
Find Takagi at all costs before that!

290
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:09,692
Copy, sir!

291
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:13,292
Where... Where are you, Officer Takagi?

292
00:15:18,592 --> 00:15:19,592
Superintendent!

293
00:15:19,592 --> 00:15:22,592
Officer Takagi is sticking the edge of the masking tape on his mouth

294
00:15:22,592 --> 00:15:24,692
onto the steel pole beside him.

295
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:26,592
Did he peel it off?

296
00:15:27,992 --> 00:15:30,909
-Well done. -He can call for help now!

297
00:15:35,192 --> 00:15:36,915
Hey, what's the matter, Takagi?

298
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:38,592
Why isn't he calling out?

299
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:41,292
He probably can't call out.

300
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:44,092
He's so weak that he has lost his voice.

301
00:15:44,092 --> 00:15:46,392
He hasn't had anything to drink for more than two days,

302
00:15:46,392 --> 00:15:48,292
so his throat is probably parched.

303
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:50,092
Oh, no.

304
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:52,592
Takagi.

305
00:15:52,592 --> 00:15:54,933
Wait a second!

306
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:58,937
Aren't those kites flying behind Officer Takagi?

307
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:02,092
But it's not only one or two!

308
00:16:02,092 --> 00:16:04,092
It... It's a kite-flying contest!

309
00:16:04,092 --> 00:16:06,392
Shiratori, can you identify the place?

310
00:16:06,392 --> 00:16:07,592
Yes, sir.

311
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:12,951
Kite-flying contests are being held at three places today in Hokkaido.

312
00:16:13,192 --> 00:16:17,792
Ikeguchi Town, Komamae Town and Hibai City.

313
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:20,592
Inform the Hokkaido Police HQ of this immediately!

314
00:16:20,592 --> 00:16:22,192
Yes, sir!

315
00:16:22,192 --> 00:16:24,963
But isn't there any way we can narrow it down to one place?

316
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:26,692
There's only less than five minutes until the bomb explodes!

317
00:16:26,692 --> 00:16:28,292
Superintendent!

318
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:30,092
He's... His mouth...

319
00:16:30,092 --> 00:16:31,792
Officer Takagi is moving his mouth

320
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:33,592
and trying to say something.

321
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,975
-What? -But the image isn't straight on.

322
00:16:37,192 --> 00:16:38,992
And with snow blocking the view,

323
00:16:38,992 --> 00:16:41,392
it's hard to read his lips.

324
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:46,985
It's Komamae.

325
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:49,492
The only three consonants you can't pronounce unless you close your lips

326
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:51,892
are "m", "b", and "p"!

327
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:53,792
If he was trying to tell us where he is,

328
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:54,792
it would have to be the three places mentioned earlier.

329
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:56,092
And the only place he would need to close his lips twice to pronounce

330
00:16:56,092 --> 00:16:57,392
would be "Komamae"!

331
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,592
Megure! Go to Komamae Town!

332
00:16:59,592 --> 00:17:03,001
Go there on the double! Takagi's there!

333
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:07,392
We're flying right over Komamae Town now!

334
00:17:08,992 --> 00:17:10,192
There he is!

335
00:17:10,192 --> 00:17:13,011
To the right of the chopper! Right below!

336
00:17:13,192 --> 00:17:15,013
Officer Takagi...

337
00:17:15,192 --> 00:17:16,592
We've found Takagi!

338
00:17:16,592 --> 00:17:19,292
He's in the vicinity of Komamae 3rd Street!

339
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:21,019
There doesn't seem to be any accomplices!

340
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,592
Hurry! There's only less than two minutes left!

341
00:17:27,592 --> 00:17:30,292
Not good! If we go any closer,

342
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:33,031
Takagi's body will fall from the impact of the wind!

343
00:17:37,392 --> 00:17:39,037
Inspector! Please use the loudspeaker

344
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:41,492
and ask the passersby and town people to evacuate!

345
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:43,492
Hey, Sato?

346
00:17:43,492 --> 00:17:45,392
Sato! Just what are you...

347
00:17:45,392 --> 00:17:46,792
Sato!

348
00:17:48,592 --> 00:17:50,392
Officer Sato...

349
00:17:54,192 --> 00:17:59,792
I felt like Officer Sato came flying down from the sky just now

350
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:01,892
with her panty and everything showing.

351
00:18:04,392 --> 00:18:08,792
I think I'm done for. I don't think I'll make it.

352
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:11,069
Takagi!

353
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:15,492
Move your head to the left, then stay still!

354
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:35,392
Sato!

355
00:18:35,392 --> 00:18:37,592
Takagi!

356
00:18:44,392 --> 00:18:45,992
Are you alive, Wataru?

357
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,792
Oh, yes... Somehow...

358
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:50,892
I'm so glad!

359
00:18:50,892 --> 00:18:53,111
We'd better get out of here quickly!

360
00:18:56,892 --> 00:18:59,117
What... What happened to Takagi?

361
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:00,892
The image went static.

362
00:19:00,892 --> 00:19:03,792
-Don't die! -Takagi!

363
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:13,992
Off... Officer Sato! We're on duty, you know?

364
00:19:13,992 --> 00:19:17,792
Who cares? Nobody's watching anyway.

365
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:23,141
He seems okay.

366
00:19:23,392 --> 00:19:25,592
Takagi...

367
00:19:25,592 --> 00:19:29,147
You should've just died.

368
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:33,151
According to the information we just got from the Hokkaido Police HQ,

369
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:35,892
the suspect, Fuemoto was suffering from terminal cancer,

370
00:19:35,892 --> 00:19:37,492
and the house where he confined Takagi in

371
00:19:37,492 --> 00:19:39,792
was bought under a fake company name.

372
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:41,159
It seems that he placed an order with the renovators

373
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:45,163
saying that he wanted to put a skylight above the entrance,

374
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:48,192
but he asked them to stop the construction

375
00:19:48,192 --> 00:19:49,792
for three days.

376
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:53,692
Nobody's listening.

377
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:57,175
Shiratori, I'll leave the rest to you.

378
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:58,792
-Yes, sir. -Megure.

379
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:00,192
The two of them are fine.

380
00:20:00,192 --> 00:20:03,692
You go on and join the Hokkaido Police HQ right away.

381
00:20:06,592 --> 00:20:08,492
It ran out of battery.

382
00:21:40,492 --> 00:21:44,892
We're a month late to visit Officer Date's grave.

383
00:21:44,892 --> 00:21:46,792
Well, Officer Takagi...

384
00:21:46,792 --> 00:21:49,592
You had to go through a lot, like frostbite and such.

385
00:21:49,592 --> 00:21:51,289
It can't be helped.

386
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:53,291
If only I had relayed to her

387
00:21:53,492 --> 00:21:56,992
that Officer Date had died of a traffic accident that day,

388
00:21:56,992 --> 00:21:58,292
this wouldn't have happened.

389
00:21:58,292 --> 00:21:59,692
Don't be silly.

390
00:21:59,692 --> 00:22:01,299
Ms. Natalie knew about it.

391
00:22:01,492 --> 00:22:04,392
She knew that Officer Date had passed away.

392
00:22:04,392 --> 00:22:08,092
Officer Date's parents remembered her.

393
00:22:08,092 --> 00:22:11,092
When they went to the hospital to confirm his body,

394
00:22:11,092 --> 00:22:12,592
they saw a Japanese-American girl

395
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:16,792
standing outside the room with tears in her eyes.

396
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:21,319
It seems that Officer Date had planned to see

397
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:24,292
and talk to her parents that night.

398
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:26,792
It also seems he wanted to bring his parents along

399
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:29,592
and introduce her to them.

400
00:22:29,592 --> 00:22:31,092
Is that so?

401
00:22:31,092 --> 00:22:34,492
That's why it wasn't your fault, Officer Takagi.

402
00:22:36,492 --> 00:22:38,892
"Date"

403
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,292
But...

404
00:22:42,292 --> 00:22:47,092
I wanted to give her this after all.

405
00:22:47,092 --> 00:22:49,347
This ring.

406
00:22:49,347 --> 00:22:52,192
Because the last words of Officer Date

407
00:22:52,192 --> 00:22:54,692
probably meant this.

408
00:22:56,392 --> 00:22:58,492
I'm leaving this...

409
00:22:59,592 --> 00:23:02,192
to you...

410
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:16,392
A toothpick.

411
00:23:18,392 --> 00:23:20,592
Why is it in a place like this?

412
00:23:20,592 --> 00:23:22,292
Come to think of it, Officer Date

413
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:24,792
used to always hold a toothpick in his mouth.

414
00:23:24,792 --> 00:23:25,892
Yes.

415
00:23:25,892 --> 00:23:28,892
Somebody who came to pay a visit here before us

416
00:23:28,892 --> 00:23:30,992
probably left it here as an offering.

417
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,392
I wonder who it was though.

418
00:23:33,392 --> 00:23:35,393
"What have you been up to? Call me every now and again! Date."

419
00:23:40,092 --> 00:23:43,401
"Delete, Cancel"

420
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:45,403
May you rest in peace...

421
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,192
my friend.

422
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

423
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,423
"Beer, coffee and cigarettes"

424
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,425
You did it, Officer Takagi!

425
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:09,220
-A live broadcast about your love. -What?

426
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,288
-We were all watching it. -What?
