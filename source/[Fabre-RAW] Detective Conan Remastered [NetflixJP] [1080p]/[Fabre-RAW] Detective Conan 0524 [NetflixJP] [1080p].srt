1
00:00:04,346 --> 00:00:06,446
Let's go to the hospital!

2
00:00:06,446 --> 00:00:07,746
Ran?

3
00:00:07,746 --> 00:00:09,146
Let's go to the hospital

4
00:00:09,146 --> 00:00:11,991
and after you're well,

5
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:13,993
you're going to have to tell me

6
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:16,446
the answer to the deduction you made, Shinichi!

7
00:00:17,446 --> 00:00:19,046
Ran.

8
00:00:19,046 --> 00:00:23,046
I feel too, that your deduction

9
00:00:23,046 --> 00:00:26,005
may be right.

10
00:00:26,246 --> 00:00:28,007
That's why...

11
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:30,346
That's why until you go to the hospital,

12
00:00:30,346 --> 00:00:33,746
I'm never going to let go. Never let go!

13
00:00:36,946 --> 00:00:38,346
Shinichi.

14
00:00:41,146 --> 00:00:43,246
A catch-22 crisis is gracefully revived,

15
00:00:43,246 --> 00:00:45,346
the table is turned and the mystery solved!

16
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:47,046
The condition set for the engagement was to stop smoking.

17
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,346
But an unexplainable explosion occurs.

18
00:00:49,346 --> 00:00:50,846
He sees through the one and only truth.

19
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:52,846
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:00:52,846 --> 00:00:54,846
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

21
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:35,003
"Blue Sparks of Hate (Part 1)".

22
00:02:39,403 --> 00:02:42,803
Ran, wake up! Ran!

23
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:48,403
Conan?

24
00:02:48,403 --> 00:02:50,149
Why?

25
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:52,903
-Is your cold okay? -Yes.

26
00:02:52,903 --> 00:02:56,155
Heiji and the others left for the airport

27
00:02:56,155 --> 00:02:59,003
to go back to Osaka on Mr. Mouri's car.

28
00:02:59,003 --> 00:03:00,159
I see.

29
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,703
By the way, Ran.

30
00:03:03,703 --> 00:03:05,903
Won't you please let go of my hand already?

31
00:03:08,403 --> 00:03:10,503
I'm sorry, did it hurt?

32
00:03:10,503 --> 00:03:11,703
Not at all!

33
00:03:11,703 --> 00:03:14,173
But that's strange.

34
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:17,903
I was holding on to Shinichi's hand,

35
00:03:17,903 --> 00:03:20,179
but I suddenly felt faint and...

36
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:23,703
That's because I shot you with this spare tranquilizer gun.

37
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,703
It's probably because you were really tired,

38
00:03:26,703 --> 00:03:29,603
but you kept holding his hand all the way.

39
00:03:29,603 --> 00:03:34,193
Even after Shinichi carried you into this car.

40
00:03:34,193 --> 00:03:37,903
Where's Shinichi? Is he also in Dad's car?

41
00:03:37,903 --> 00:03:41,003
No, after riding with us for a while,

42
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:43,403
he got better

43
00:03:43,403 --> 00:03:47,103
and left to finish a case that he was working on.

44
00:03:47,103 --> 00:03:50,209
Which means he brushed my hand away and left?

45
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:52,503
That deduction freak prince.

46
00:03:52,503 --> 00:03:54,213
Freak prince...

47
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:55,903
But how vexing,

48
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:59,903
after I swore that I would never let go...

49
00:04:01,403 --> 00:04:04,803
How stupid. Take a good look

50
00:04:04,803 --> 00:04:07,503
at the left side of Shinichi's sweater.

51
00:04:07,503 --> 00:04:09,803
It's cut from the top of the sleeve to the bottom

52
00:04:09,803 --> 00:04:12,231
and fastened together with a safety pin.

53
00:04:12,403 --> 00:04:16,903
That's proof that he wore his sweater with his left hand blocked.

54
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:20,903
So, you have no reason to feel vexed.

55
00:04:24,903 --> 00:04:26,703
Oh, no. A cold again?

56
00:04:26,703 --> 00:04:29,403
Nope! I'm fine! Just fine.

57
00:04:36,503 --> 00:04:39,103
Thanks to the little lady putting the lady of the detective agency

58
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:41,903
to sleep with the tranquilizer gun.

59
00:04:41,903 --> 00:04:44,263
You succeeded in keeping your secret despite holding her hands

60
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:48,003
as well as shrinking again in the car.

61
00:04:48,003 --> 00:04:49,603
Holding hands?

62
00:04:49,603 --> 00:04:51,403
Who did you hear about it from?

63
00:04:51,403 --> 00:04:55,003
I heard about it from an old man called Agasa on the phone.

64
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,277
Doc, you didn't have to tell him.

65
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:01,403
And? Did you get that drug?

66
00:05:01,403 --> 00:05:04,283
The one that would make your body normal again.

67
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:08,303
It's better to have that drug on you just in case, right?

68
00:05:08,303 --> 00:05:10,803
Yeah, I think so too.

69
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:15,903
Hey, you guys! Didn't I tell you not to look?

70
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,703
Hey, Kudo.

71
00:05:17,703 --> 00:05:19,703
Never mind. Ignore that.

72
00:05:19,703 --> 00:05:22,301
We're all on the way to go camping.

73
00:05:24,703 --> 00:05:27,803
And? And then what happened?

74
00:05:29,803 --> 00:05:33,803
I told Ai to give me 100 tablets of the drug for now.

75
00:05:33,803 --> 00:05:35,603
Hundred?

76
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:36,903
Yeah.

77
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:40,003
I thought it wouldn't be enough unless I had that many but...

78
00:05:40,003 --> 00:05:41,903
I already warned you

79
00:05:41,903 --> 00:05:43,503
that each time you drink that drug,

80
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:46,103
the more your body will build up resistance to it,

81
00:05:46,103 --> 00:05:48,327
and it will become more and more ineffective.

82
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:50,903
Don't blame me if you eventually really won't be able

83
00:05:50,903 --> 00:05:53,003
to get back your adult body.

84
00:05:53,003 --> 00:05:56,335
Well, but for you who wants to look good

85
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:58,803
in front of that girl at the detective agency,

86
00:05:58,803 --> 00:06:02,603
even a 100 tablets isn't going to last you a week.

87
00:06:02,603 --> 00:06:04,803
How dare she talk like that?

88
00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:06,345
Hey, Kudo.

89
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:09,203
The little lady said that it's not good,

90
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,003
but isn't it better for you

91
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:14,353
to tell the detective agency lady the whole truth?

92
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:16,803
You probably want to tell her how you really feel too, don't you?

93
00:06:16,803 --> 00:06:20,359
Idiot! It's nothing like that,

94
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:22,361
and I can't let things go that way!

95
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:25,003
What can't you let go?

96
00:06:25,003 --> 00:06:27,803
Aren't you going camping?

97
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:30,369
Oh, no. Well...

98
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:32,903
Idiot! I'm going camping in the mountains,

99
00:06:32,903 --> 00:06:35,203
there's no way there'll be a squid there.

100
00:06:37,603 --> 00:06:40,379
You're talking about something like that on the phone?

101
00:06:40,603 --> 00:06:44,003
No, I'm finished talking on the phone.

102
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:45,503
Hey! Hold it.

103
00:06:48,003 --> 00:06:50,389
He hung up.

104
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:52,003
Geez.

105
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:56,803
I'm so excited about the camping grounds we're headed for!

106
00:06:56,803 --> 00:07:01,003
Yes! It seems like a place with nice scenery.

107
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:04,403
By the way, what would you like for dinner tonight?

108
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:06,703
I bought a lot of foodstuffs along!

109
00:07:06,703 --> 00:07:08,407
Okay, I want a barbecue then!

110
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:11,403
That's what you always want, Genta!

111
00:07:11,403 --> 00:07:13,503
Conan, what about you?

112
00:07:13,503 --> 00:07:15,603
I guess the usual, curry over rice.

113
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:16,903
What about you, Ai?

114
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,203
I don't really care.

115
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:20,803
Anything that's edible is fine with me.

116
00:07:22,203 --> 00:07:24,003
Oh, no sweat!

117
00:07:24,003 --> 00:07:27,203
It seems she's been this way all the way from this morning.

118
00:07:27,203 --> 00:07:30,429
I'm sure she's upset over something that's not worth worrying over again.

119
00:07:41,803 --> 00:07:44,443
Don't tell me you ran out of gas again?

120
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:48,003
Didn't you have your car checked before you left?

121
00:07:48,003 --> 00:07:52,451
Yeah, so the engine's working just great,

122
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:55,303
but I guess I ran out of gas.

123
00:07:57,203 --> 00:07:59,603
Well, it's almost sundown,

124
00:07:59,603 --> 00:08:02,803
so let's hurry and call somebody to bring gasoline here to us.

125
00:08:02,803 --> 00:08:06,465
Yeah. I thought so too, and was just about to call him.

126
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:07,603
Him?

127
00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:10,469
Remember, the man who lives next door to me

128
00:08:10,703 --> 00:08:15,603
since the fire incident the other day, Subaru Okiya.

129
00:08:15,603 --> 00:08:17,103
He told me that he was going to be home all day today

130
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:18,803
without anything to do.

131
00:08:18,803 --> 00:08:22,103
I'm sure he can get here in less than two hours.

132
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:24,483
This place is out of service range of the cell phone!

133
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:28,487
What're we supposed to do out in the mountains like this?

134
00:08:28,703 --> 00:08:30,203
There's still some distance to go

135
00:08:30,203 --> 00:08:33,203
before the camping grounds, is there?

136
00:08:33,203 --> 00:08:36,803
Well, we've got three choices.

137
00:08:36,803 --> 00:08:38,497
We can walk back to the service station

138
00:08:38,497 --> 00:08:41,603
that we passed by 30 minutes ago,

139
00:08:41,603 --> 00:08:44,303
buy gasoline and come back.

140
00:08:44,303 --> 00:08:47,803
We can wait here till a car comes by

141
00:08:47,803 --> 00:08:51,603
and have that car take us to a service station

142
00:08:51,603 --> 00:08:53,203
or...

143
00:08:53,203 --> 00:08:56,103
we could go up to that villa on top of the mountain

144
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:58,903
and borrow the phone.

145
00:08:58,903 --> 00:09:01,403
Well, to go back to the service station,

146
00:09:01,403 --> 00:09:04,103
it would take more than two hours.

147
00:09:04,103 --> 00:09:07,203
It would be pretty tough waiting here for a car to pass by

148
00:09:07,203 --> 00:09:10,303
because we virtually saw no oncoming cars on our way here.

149
00:09:10,303 --> 00:09:13,703
So, I think it's best we go up to that villa

150
00:09:13,703 --> 00:09:16,103
where the light is on.

151
00:09:16,103 --> 00:09:17,803
It's a nice house!

152
00:09:17,803 --> 00:09:19,903
A place where a princess would be living!

153
00:09:19,903 --> 00:09:23,003
I wonder if they'll serve us gorgeous food when we get there?

154
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:25,403
Like a full course French dinner?

155
00:09:25,403 --> 00:09:27,603
I prefer Italian!

156
00:09:27,603 --> 00:09:30,303
I thought we came to go camping, you guys.

157
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:41,903
Stop! Stop! Stop!

158
00:09:46,103 --> 00:09:48,003
Is anything wrong?

159
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:49,503
I'm very sorry,

160
00:09:49,503 --> 00:09:53,203
but could you give me a ride to the nearest service station?

161
00:09:53,203 --> 00:09:55,903
"Goki Sudo (34), IT Company President" -Yes, I don't mind,

162
00:09:55,903 --> 00:09:57,803
but will you give me a bit more detailed information?

163
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:02,603
Well, we're on our way to the camping ground

164
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:05,203
but ran out of gasoline.

165
00:10:05,203 --> 00:10:07,703
This place is also out of service range of the cell phone,

166
00:10:07,703 --> 00:10:09,803
so we were at a loss what to do.

167
00:10:09,803 --> 00:10:12,303
I see, so that's the story.

168
00:10:12,303 --> 00:10:14,103
Then,

169
00:10:14,103 --> 00:10:16,303
why don't you stay here forever?

170
00:10:16,303 --> 00:10:17,703
Old fart!

171
00:10:25,903 --> 00:10:27,603
What's with that guy?

172
00:10:27,603 --> 00:10:29,003
What a snob!

173
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,609
He's the pits!

174
00:10:30,803 --> 00:10:33,003
Well, we may have to ask that snob

175
00:10:33,003 --> 00:10:36,103
to do us a favor again, though.

176
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:39,003
What? Why?

177
00:10:39,003 --> 00:10:40,403
That car just now

178
00:10:40,403 --> 00:10:42,003
is a classic car that's preferred by the rich

179
00:10:42,003 --> 00:10:44,623
and requires ridiculously high maintenance cost.

180
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:47,403
A guy driving around in that kind of car

181
00:10:47,403 --> 00:10:51,203
may just be the same guy that built an extravagant villa like that

182
00:10:51,203 --> 00:10:53,803
out in the mountains, so...

183
00:10:53,803 --> 00:10:55,103
No way!

184
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:58,003
Let's not ask a guy like him!

185
00:10:58,003 --> 00:10:59,303
Yeah.

186
00:10:59,303 --> 00:11:00,903
I would rather

187
00:11:00,903 --> 00:11:03,903
just wait here for another car to come by than ask someone like him.

188
00:11:03,903 --> 00:11:07,003
Well, there's a possibility that the man we just saw

189
00:11:07,003 --> 00:11:10,649
was heading for a totally different place and not that villa.

190
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:13,503
I don't think it'll hurt to at least give it a try?

191
00:11:13,503 --> 00:11:15,203
That's right.

192
00:11:15,203 --> 00:11:18,403
Let's leave our luggage in the car and go there.

193
00:11:18,403 --> 00:11:21,103
Right, maybe if we all ask together...

194
00:11:21,103 --> 00:11:25,303
We should at least take a flashlight along with us too, then.

195
00:11:25,303 --> 00:11:27,403
It's getting dark.

196
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:30,003
There's one in the pocket behind the driver's seat,

197
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:31,003
so will you get it for me?

198
00:11:31,003 --> 00:11:32,671
Okay, sure!

199
00:11:35,503 --> 00:11:37,303
What's with you?

200
00:11:37,303 --> 00:11:39,003
Acting like a queen and all.

201
00:11:39,003 --> 00:11:41,603
Is that what it looks like to you?

202
00:11:41,603 --> 00:11:43,703
I don't know what's got into you,

203
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,303
but we're out camping, you know.

204
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:50,403
An explosion?

205
00:11:56,103 --> 00:11:58,103
That... that is...

206
00:11:58,103 --> 00:12:00,699
the emblem that was on the car we just saw!

207
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:06,203
Conan?

208
00:12:06,203 --> 00:12:07,903
If it was the car we just saw,

209
00:12:07,903 --> 00:12:09,803
why'd it explode?

210
00:12:09,803 --> 00:12:12,503
Was it loaded with explosives to begin with?

211
00:12:12,503 --> 00:12:15,203
Then, is it that he didn't let us on,

212
00:12:15,203 --> 00:12:18,003
because he didn't want us to get mixed up in the explosion?

213
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:21,103
That can't be. He didn't look that way at all.

214
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:29,203
Goki!

215
00:12:29,203 --> 00:12:31,303
No, Ena! It's dangerous!

216
00:12:31,303 --> 00:12:32,731
But...

217
00:12:32,903 --> 00:12:35,403
The fire station and ambulance have already been contacted!

218
00:12:35,403 --> 00:12:36,735
No!

219
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,103
Ena!

220
00:12:38,103 --> 00:12:41,103
Is that Goki that you're calling...

221
00:12:41,103 --> 00:12:42,741
The one with brown hair, has a beard on his chin,

222
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:46,745
was wearing a white wool sweater and a black fleece jacket?

223
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:48,747
Who are you?

224
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:51,203
I happened to pass a person driving a classic car

225
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:54,403
that looked just like him a while ago.

226
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,399
The victim is Mr. Goki Sudo, age 34.

227
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:09,999
I hear he's the president of an IT business,

228
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:14,399
that brought him a lot of cash which after he built this villa.

229
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,899
The cause of the fire

230
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:17,399
was a cigarette that he was holding in his mouth.

231
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,777
A cigarette he was holding in his mouth?

232
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:21,999
Yeah, a poly tank in the garage

233
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:24,099
just happened to be knocked over

234
00:13:24,099 --> 00:13:26,199
and the gasoline that had vaporized was all over the garage

235
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:28,299
when Mr. Sudo came along in his car.

236
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:30,499
He opened the door of the garage

237
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:33,199
and parked his car inside

238
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:36,399
with a lighted cigarette in his mouth.

239
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,499
The minute he got off the car, he caught fire.

240
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:42,801
The fire enveloped his car too and boom!

241
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:46,399
A burnt black cigarette butt was found too.

242
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,999
That can't be!

243
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:51,399
"Ena Ginbayashi (31), Sudo's fiance" -Goki said that he quit smoking!

244
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:53,899
For me, because I don't like cigarettes.

245
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,999
And who are you?

246
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:59,199
She's Ena Ginbayashi, Sudo's fiance.

247
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:01,899
Every weekend,

248
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:05,399
we all gather here to have a party,

249
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,399
but tonight, Sudo said that he would be announcing something.

250
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,699
It's about our wedding.

251
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:13,599
He was scheduled to announce the date of our wedding

252
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:16,835
because it's been set!

253
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:20,839
And yet... And yet what a terrible thing to have happened.

254
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:25,699
The burnt remains of a marriage registration were found.

255
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:28,299
So I guess that's true.

256
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:32,851
But I think he lied to you about quitting smoking.

257
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:37,299
There were a lot of cigarette butts in the ashtray of his car

258
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:40,859
and near his body, there was a cigarette butt that was burnt black too.

259
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:42,599
There was a bag on the ground

260
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:47,799
and inside it there were an unopened box of cigarettes and a lighter.

261
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,599
No... no way.

262
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,871
I just told him a while ago, to please not smoke too.

263
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:53,999
A while ago?

264
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:56,099
Just about an hour ago,

265
00:14:56,099 --> 00:15:00,899
I got a call from Goki saying that he was headed this way.

266
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,499
That's when Ena told him,

267
00:15:03,499 --> 00:15:04,883
"If you don't quit smoking,

268
00:15:05,099 --> 00:15:07,399
I'm calling off the engagement."

269
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:10,399
Was that call really from Mr. Sudo?

270
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,891
Yes, I'm the one who answered the phone,

271
00:15:13,099 --> 00:15:15,599
and I got on the line again before hanging up too.

272
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:17,999
Which means on top of not quitting smoking,

273
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:22,199
he used poly tanks that are not recommended for storing gasoline.

274
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,499
In other words, he brought it upon himself.

275
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:26,899
This case is definitely an accident.

276
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:29,199
No, you can't really say that.

277
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,199
What?

278
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:34,499
Because if Mr. Sudo got off the car with a lighted cigarette in his mouth,

279
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:38,699
he would've had to light his cigarette a while before he got off, right?

280
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:44,199
But the unsealed box of cigarette hasn't been found anywhere.

281
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:48,927
That's right, isn't it, forensic officer?

282
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:50,399
Is... is that true?

283
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,599
Yes, nothing's been found anywhere,

284
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:54,499
neither in the car nor in the garage.

285
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:57,399
But why isn't it around?

286
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:58,937
It could be because that cigarette butt

287
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:03,499
was on the ground of the garage before Mr. Sudo came.

288
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:07,399
Hey, Conan!

289
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,947
Just what do you mean?

290
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,949
Please explain!

291
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:12,951
This is not a plain accident,

292
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:15,299
but rather an accident that's been set up.

293
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:17,699
This could be a case of homicide.

294
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:19,699
Are you serious, Conan?

295
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:20,959
Yeah.

296
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,199
The poly tank that was in the garage

297
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:26,199
happened to be knocked over.

298
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:29,999
The gasoline vaporizes and fills the entire garage.

299
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:34,099
Then Goki comes along in his car and goes into the garage.

300
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:35,799
He stops his car

301
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:36,975
and holds a lighted cigarette in his mouth.

302
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:38,977
He catches fire as soon as he gets out of the car

303
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:40,979
and it explodes.

304
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:45,699
The cigarette butt that was the cause of the fire

305
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:48,599
was found in the garage.

306
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:49,899
At first glance,

307
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:52,299
it looks to be nothing but an accident,

308
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:54,599
but if the unsealed cigarette box

309
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:58,599
that he took the cigarette out of isn't anywhere in sight,

310
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:00,199
the cigarette butt

311
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:02,499
must've been here in the garage

312
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:05,003
even before Mr. Sudo got to the garage.

313
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:08,099
It could be mistaken evidence

314
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,299
that the culprit deliberately left behind,

315
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:12,599
to make this look like an accident.

316
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,599
Wow, Conan!

317
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,299
Just as expected of you!

318
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:19,017
But sonny,

319
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:21,899
we've been investigating inside the garage for a while now

320
00:17:21,899 --> 00:17:25,499
but nothing like an igniting device was found.

321
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:30,699
But Mr. Sudo didn't have a cigarette case on him either, did he?

322
00:17:30,699 --> 00:17:31,799
No.

323
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,899
If so, something's just not right.

324
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:36,299
If you check closer, I'm sure something would come up.

325
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,499
It was his last cigarette.

326
00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:43,041
Maybe he threw the empty box of cigarettes

327
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,699
out the window of the car before coming into the garage

328
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:48,599
because that was going to be his last cigarette?

329
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:55,053
Goki used to always crumple up empty cigarette boxes and do so.

330
00:17:56,499 --> 00:17:59,057
So, if we look around the area of this villa,

331
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:01,059
we'd be able to find empty cigarette boxes?

332
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:03,061
I guess so.

333
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:05,063
But I think it's been a while

334
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:07,499
since he threw away empty boxes of cigarettes.

335
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:11,069
If Goki lied about not smoking anymore,

336
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:15,073
don't you think he would avoid disposing the butts around the villa?

337
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:18,199
If that's the case, we'll have to investigate a wide area,

338
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:20,199
and that'll be a hell of tough work.

339
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:23,699
There was a deep valley alongside the road too.

340
00:18:23,699 --> 00:18:25,799
But that's all I can come up with.

341
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:27,499
Hey, Miss.

342
00:18:27,499 --> 00:18:31,499
Do you really believe that Mr. Sudo quit smoking?

343
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:36,899
If you knew that Mr. Sudo was smoking in secret,

344
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:37,899
all you had to do

345
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:40,399
was knock down the poly tank in the garage with the gasoline inside.

346
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:41,799
What do you think you're saying?

347
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:45,599
Nobody noticed Mr. Sudo smoking in secret!

348
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:46,799
Yes!

349
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,399
After he said he was going to quit smoking,

350
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:50,399
he didn't smoke at all!

351
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:53,999
But that's only in front of you people, right?

352
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:57,499
We met Mr. Sudo a little before the incident

353
00:18:57,499 --> 00:18:59,799
but since he would easily lie about anything,

354
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:01,799
I thought that you as his fiance

355
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:05,123
would've known about it.

356
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:06,899
Easily lie?

357
00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:10,099
Yes, on our way to the camping grounds by car,

358
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:12,099
we happened to run out of gas,

359
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:15,899
so we stopped Mr. Sudo's car that happened to pass by.

360
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:19,899
I asked him if he would drive me to the service station but...

361
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:21,599
He was a real snob!

362
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:23,141
When doc went over to the driver's seat

363
00:19:23,141 --> 00:19:24,699
and explained the situation to him...

364
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:27,899
At first, he said he give us a lift and yet!

365
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:30,099
He gave a super snide remark and drove off.

366
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:34,299
Why don't you stay here forever? Old fart!

367
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,155
Hey, hey, that's terrible!

368
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:39,799
I hate to talk about people who are no longer here,

369
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:42,499
but he really didn't look to be someone who'd be keeping his promise

370
00:19:42,499 --> 00:19:44,799
about not smoking.

371
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,599
It's true that it's something that Sudo would say, but...

372
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:49,999
I thought that he kept to his promise of not smoking.

373
00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:53,699
Yes, because Sudo was head over heels over Ena.

374
00:19:53,699 --> 00:19:57,175
And besides, if he were... That is if...

375
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:59,599
he were to be secretly smoking behind my back

376
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,799
and I found out about it,

377
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:05,183
I did tell him on the phone in front of everyone, before he came here

378
00:20:05,399 --> 00:20:10,599
that if he didn't quit smoking, I would nullify our engagement!

379
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:12,499
It's unthinkable that after hearing what I said,

380
00:20:12,499 --> 00:20:15,999
he would get off his car holding a lighted cigarette in his mouth.

381
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,899
Do you think I could've foreseen that he would do something like that?

382
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:21,199
It's just as she says.

383
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:25,199
So long as she told him not to smoke in front of everyone,

384
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:28,599
it's difficult to prove that this is a case of homicide.

385
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:30,999
No, the cause of the fire is not the cigarette.

386
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:35,499
I don't know if he really quit smoking or not,

387
00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:40,199
but I don't think he was smoking in his car today.

388
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:42,699
When Doc stopped his car,

389
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,223
I also went up to the driver's seat,

390
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:47,599
but he didn't smell of cigarette.

391
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,599
Then, why did the fire start in the garage?

392
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:53,699
Beats me, I don't know for sure yet,

393
00:20:53,699 --> 00:20:57,235
but I'm pretty sure that Ena is the one who set it up.

394
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:03,241
Remember?

395
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:08,399
Ena at first cried and bit back at Inspector Yuminaga

396
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:10,399
who said that the cause of the fire was a lit cigarette.

397
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:14,299
Goki said that he quit smoking!

398
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:17,799
But even before you had time to take that in,

399
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:18,799
in answer to my remark

400
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,699
that it's strange that no unsealed box of cigarettes is around...

401
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,799
Maybe he threw the empty box of cigarettes

402
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,899
out the window of the car before coming into the garage.

403
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:31,899
If she really believed that he had quit smoking,

404
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:34,899
she would've agreed with my remark, right?

405
00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:38,699
And said something like, "See, so he quit smoking after all!"

406
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:40,199
True.

407
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:43,899
However, if her contradictory remark

408
00:21:43,899 --> 00:21:46,799
was that of the culprit, it makes sense.

409
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,999
She bit back at Inspector Yuminaga

410
00:21:48,999 --> 00:21:51,289
because she wanted to appeal the fact that

411
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:53,899
she didn't know Goki was smoking behind her back.

412
00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:56,399
And she argued back at me saying that the cause of the fire

413
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:58,499
was unmistakably from a lighted cigarette,

414
00:21:58,499 --> 00:22:01,699
because that what she wanted to get through.

415
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:04,299
It seems that Ena wants to make it look like

416
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:07,299
"an accidental fire that was caused by a lighted cigarette" no matter what.

417
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:09,899
What? So, it's not an accident after all?

418
00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:12,399
Are you saying that the fire ignited by itself?

419
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:13,999
But there's a saying that goes,

420
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,299
"No smoke rises, where there is no fire", isn't there?

421
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:19,599
That's why I'm thinking that over now.

422
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,319
There's got to be something!

423
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:25,323
A trick that can be used

424
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:28,099
to set the garage on fire without using an igniting device.

425
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,411
Next Conan's Hint:

426
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,413
"Wool sweater".

427
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,415
There's a fuzzball on your sweater.

428
00:23:57,415 --> 00:23:58,614
That because it's wool.

429
00:23:58,614 --> 00:23:59,866
There's a price tag on your sweater.

430
00:23:59,866 --> 00:24:01,060
That's because it's a bargain sale.
