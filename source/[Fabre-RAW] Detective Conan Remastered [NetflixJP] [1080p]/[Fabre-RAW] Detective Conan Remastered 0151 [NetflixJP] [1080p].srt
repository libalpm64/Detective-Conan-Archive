1
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,710
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,410
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,210
Today's episode has the smallest cast ever.

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,210
Stay right there for a sudden reversal of circumstances.

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,910
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,810
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,210
His name is Detective Conan.

8
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,220
A car that is rigged with an explosive explodes at the parental home

9
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:45,820
of Megumi Sakihara, a person who Pops used to tutor in his school days.

10
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,320
The victim who passes away in the incident turns out to be Megumi's younger sister, Hiromi,

11
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,620
who was reversing the car out of the garage for Megumi

12
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,320
because she was supposedly not good at it.

13
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,820
The suspect turns up to be a man named Hiromasa Takahashi.

14
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,320
He agrees to carry out an exchange murder

15
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,420
with Megumi's husband, Kazuo Sakihara.

16
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,620
However, he inadvertently kills Hiromi instead of Megumi.

17
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,620
Both men confess to their crime,

18
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,120
and it looks at first glance that the case had been solved.

19
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,620
She reversed out of such a narrow parking space.

20
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,220
This case has not yet ended.

21
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,820
"The Car Explosion Case (Part 2)"

22
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,620
Conan, what's up?

23
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,120
Hey, is anything wrong?

24
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,820
No, it's nothing.

25
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,720
I think Megumi came here to buy us some cake or something.

26
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,920
Let's hurry and go to Megumi's house.

27
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,720
Seriously.

28
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,920
What's with that kid anyway?

29
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,820
It's too early to tell Pops about this.

30
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,220
I've got to get more corroborative proof.

31
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,120
I just don't know what to say.

32
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,820
Thank you very much.

33
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,220
I am fine, so please don't worry yourself over me.

34
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,520
Please have some tea before it gets cold.

35
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,520
Thank you.

36
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,720
I'll have some, too.

37
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,020
How about some cake, Conan?

38
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,720
Okay.

39
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,520
May I go to the restroom first?

40
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,020
Over there.

41
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:15,220
Sakihara had a phone exclusively for himself in his study upstairs

42
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,620
and took all his calls with that phone.

43
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,620
What's that?

44
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,220
That's the remains of masking tape being peeled off.

45
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,220
Just as I thought.

46
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,020
So, "it" was set up there, after all.

47
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,220
I'll bet you're relieved that Megumi looked way better

48
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,420
than you thought she would, right, Dad?

49
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,920
Yeah. I'll guess she'll do okay.

50
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,820
I've got some place to stop by when we get to Beika Station,

51
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,520
so you can both leave me and go home.

52
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,820
All right, but remember, don't be too late.

53
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,720
There's a window.

54
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,420
I see. If it's from that window...

55
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,920
Just as I thought.

56
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,820
Okay. I've got the overall picture.

57
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,420
Now, all I need is proof.

58
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,620
"Mouri Detective Agency"

59
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,420
I am back!

60
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,320
Pops.

61
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,020
Something bothers me about the case.

62
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,120
What?

63
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,120
Well, do you remember Megumi reversed her car

64
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,020
out of the narrow parking space of the supermarket today, right?

65
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,820
Then why did she have her younger sister back her car out for her

66
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,820
when the incident happened?

67
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,720
Besides, on the wall near the telephone

68
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,820
of the upstairs study of Megumi's house,

69
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,920
it looked like masking tape was peeled off.

70
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,420
That means that something was stuck on there, right?

71
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,020
Masking tape?

72
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,720
Did you know that there was a window way inside the garage

73
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,120
where the incident occurred, Pops?

74
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,420
It seems that the window cracked from the impact of the explosion

75
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,620
and a wooden board was placed over it.

76
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,120
But, with a window like that over there,

77
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,920
it's good because you can get a good view of the car

78
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,920
from inside the house.

79
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,320
What are you trying to get at?

80
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,420
Are you insinuating that Megumi has something to do with this case?

81
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,720
I don't know.

82
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,420
But...

83
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,620
Don't be ridiculous.

84
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:21,420
I know her best because she used to be my student.

85
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,820
You knew her as a high school student, right, Pops?

86
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:33,020
Megumi could've changed after growing up.

87
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,320
Don't you dare get cheeky with me!

88
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,720
She hasn't changed a bit!

89
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,420
She's the way she always used to be!

90
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,120
You want to believe so, don't you, Pops?

91
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
What?

92
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,420
But, actually she's already...

93
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,620
Shut up and go on upstairs!

94
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,220
I'm going to go take a bath.

95
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:05,820
Seriously. How dare that brat to talk to me like that.

96
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,120
A secret window?

97
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,520
"16 years old Megumi" -Yes, Hiromi and I call it that.

98
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,020
It seems that Dad actually wanted to use this as a door, though.

99
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,020
When I was little and getting into things in the garage,

100
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,220
I would always be scolded from here.

101
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,820
"Police Station" -The record of the testimonies of Sakihara and Takahashi?

102
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,120
Yes. I'd like to take a quick look and review the results.

103
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,620
Did anything new come up in later investigations?

104
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,970
According to one of Hiromi's friends,

105
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,870
the late Hiromi seems to have

106
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,270
taken two boyfriends away from Megumi, in her younger days.

107
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,570
Well, I guess you could say that she was very carefree.

108
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,970
It seems that Hiromi was only fooling around for the fun of it.

109
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:15,070
But, it seems that when Megumi decided to marry Sakihara,

110
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,770
although jokingly, she warned Hiromi saying that if she did it again,

111
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,270
she would make her pay for it.

112
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,670
Pops'll probably come up with some sort of

113
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,870
circumstantial evidence in his investigation.

114
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:36,370
But, when it comes to concrete evidence...

115
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,370
I see. Maybe...

116
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,670
Inspector, about what I asked you over the phone a while ago...

117
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,370
Yes. I confirmed with Takahashi,

118
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:04,370
but the only time he saw her face was at that supermarket.

119
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,870
That's the first and last time he ever appeared before Megumi.

120
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,870
And, how was Takahashi dressed at that time?

121
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,670
He was wearing a jacket and sunglasses.

122
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,870
Just as I thought.

123
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,470
Mouri, what are you up to anyway?

124
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,270
Thank you very much, inspector. Goodbye.

125
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,170
Hey, Mouri?

126
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,570
Okay. So, now I've got proof.

127
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,460
What? What do you mean?

128
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,060
Hey, Dad?

129
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,060
He hung up.

130
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,960
What's the matter, Ran?

131
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,760
Dad's in Akihabara now and says he's going to Megumi's house from now.

132
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,860
He said that he is the only one who can persuade her.

133
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,160
I wonder what he means?

134
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,660
Ran, let's go to Megumi's house, too!

135
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,660
Seriously.

136
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,360
Why'd you guys have to come, too?

137
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,460
I'm sorry, but I was really concerned over your call.

138
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,160
Sorry to keep you waiting.

139
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,860
Thank you very much.

140
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,260
And, what is it you wanted to talk to me about?

141
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,560
Megumi, I came here today to advise you to turn yourself in.

142
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,060
Hey, Dad.

143
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,660
After finding out that your husband and your younger sister

144
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,760
were having an affair,

145
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:27,260
as an exchange murder was being planned between your husband and Takahashi,

146
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,360
you decided to use all this

147
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,860
to kill your younger sister that you have always hated

148
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,860
and send your husband to jail on charges of murder, isn't that right?

149
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,960
Dad. What a thing to say.

150
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,260
Two months ago, you bought a wire-tap

151
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,460
and automatic recorder at a shop in Akihabara.

152
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,160
You asked the salesperson to give you

153
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,660
the details on how to use the machines.

154
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,660
These are the same modular-type wiretap

155
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,460
and automatic recorder that you bought.

156
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,860
I didn't want to do it,

157
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,160
but when I went to the restroom a while ago,

158
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,660
I checked out the upstairs study.

159
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,560
You rigged a wire-tap to your husband's study

160
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,860
and bugged his conversations with Takahashi.

161
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,460
The remains of masking tape being peeled off from the wall is proof.

162
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,460
You were probably planning to listen to the conversation

163
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,360
between your husband and your younger sister at first, weren't you?

164
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,160
But, along the way, you find out something awesomely terrible.

165
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,960
That is, your husband had agreed

166
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,560
to an exchange murder with a complete stranger

167
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,460
and that he had already killed the wife of that man.

168
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:47,360
The time came when it was your turn to be killed by that man Takahashi.

169
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,260
You found out that he is planning to rig your car with an explosive,

170
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,260
but is undecided, because if he does so in front of your house,

171
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,360
your husband Kazuo, may turn up as a suspect, too.

172
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,460
Therefore, you deliberately tell your husband

173
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,460
that you are driving over to Hiromi's,

174
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,860
because her car just happens

175
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,860
to be at the service station for a safety check,

176
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,160
and the garage is open.

177
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,660
Your husband then goes out to a payphone

178
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,660
and tells Takahashi all that you told him.

179
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,160
Although you didn't listen to their phone conversation,

180
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,560
almost positive that Takahashi was going to carry out his murder plan,

181
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,760
you went over to Hiromi's.

182
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,960
And, after telling Hiromi that you were not good at reversing,

183
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,060
you made her back the car out of the garage for you.

184
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,460
Just as you had expected, your younger sister died.

185
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:46,560
But, at that time, just one thing that you didn't expect happened.

186
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,260
I happened to come and see you.

187
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,660
You were surprised and...

188
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,160
Wait, Mr. Mouri!

189
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,360
Okay!

190
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,860
You wanted her to back out right away

191
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:04,560
because you didn't want me to see through your plan.

192
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,460
I did buy the wiretap as you say.

193
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,960
I set it up behind the desk after suspecting

194
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,560
my husband of having an affair with someone.

195
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,360
But, I thought it over right away and immediately disposed of it.

196
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,160
Therefore, I didn't actually use it!

197
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,260
Did you know that the person he was having an affair with

198
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,160
was your younger sister?

199
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,060
I didn't know at all.

200
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,760
Let's presume... This is just a presumption now,

201
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,160
that I did act as you had deduced,

202
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,160
what charges am I guilty for?

203
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,960
Takashi is the one who rigged the explosive onto the car,

204
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,660
and the person who made him do it is my husband.

205
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:04,360
All I did, if anything is make my younger sister get into a car

206
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,660
that was maybe rigged with an explosive.

207
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,960
I'm not an accomplice in a crime,

208
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,260
nor did urge anyone to commit murder for me.

209
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,760
Isn't that right, Mr. Mouri?

210
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,060
Just as expected of a student in the law department,

211
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,960
and a daughter of a lawyer.

212
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,560
Just as you say,

213
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,860
if all you did was get your younger sister to ride the car,

214
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,760
you wouldn't be found guilty of anything.

215
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,360
-Why then... -However,

216
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,160
in the case that you made your sister get in the car

217
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,860
despite knowing that an explosive was rigged to the car,

218
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,760
or if the possibility that you knew was very high.

219
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,160
You will be charged with homicide!

220
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,360
You mentioned back then

221
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,860
that you had to look for something and went into the closet alone.

222
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,460
Then, you were watching the garage from the window.

223
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,760
And, just as expected, Takahashi came into the garage

224
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,860
to set the explosive onto the car.

225
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,060
After you confirmed all that,

226
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,960
you asked your sister to back the car out.

227
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,960
In other words, there was a very high possibility

228
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
that the explosive was being rigged to the car,

229
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,360
and you still made your sister ride it.

230
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,060
Do you have any proof

231
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,060
that I was watching the garage through the closet?

232
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,260
If you do, please show it to me right now!

233
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,460
Right this minute!

234
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,260
You've got proof, Pops.

235
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,160
Remember? The sketch of the man that Megumi said she saw,

236
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,060
that was drawn by police officer Honjo.

237
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,760
Megumi, where did you say you saw his face?

238
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,160
At the supermarket near my house.

239
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,360
Strange. The officer mentioned

240
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,660
that Takahashi was wearing a jacket and sunglasses back then.

241
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,260
But, why is the man in the sketch not wearing sunglasses?

242
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,560
Megumi, isn't it true that you didn't even notice

243
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,260
Takahashi was watching you at the supermarket?

244
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,160
You found out only after you listened to the conversation

245
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,260
between Kazuo and Takahashi that you tapped, right?

246
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,260
Then where did she see his face?

247
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,860
From the closet!

248
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,260
She saw him from the secret window of the closet!

249
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,960
Megumi, you were watching Takahashi's face

250
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,460
from the closet of your parental home.

251
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,360
The face of Takahashi who was setting up the explosive.

252
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,960
How... how can you be so sure?

253
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,860
That day, Takahashi who didn't want anybody to notice him,

254
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,160
was wearing sunglasses until he entered the garage.

255
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,260
Of course, he was his sunglasses when coming out, too.

256
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:15,460
However, there was just one time he had to take off his sunglasses.

257
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,160
It was when he was setting the explosive onto the car.

258
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,960
Because nobody would even dream of doing a dangerous job

259
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,960
like setting up an explosive onto a car while wearing sunglasses.

260
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,260
In other words, this sketch of Takahashi without his sunglasses

261
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,860
is proof that you witnessed Takahashi

262
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,760
rigging the explosive to the car in the garage.

263
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,460
Just as you say, I happened to hear them.

264
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,260
He was planning to kill me

265
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,760
and use the insurance money that I was covered with

266
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,860
together with the inheritance money my parents left for me

267
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,860
to open a new boutique that Hiromi was to own.

268
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,260
I remember the good old days.

269
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,760
I was really happy in those days.

270
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,160
I kept hoping that I could go back to those good old days all this time.

271
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,160
But...

272
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,460
15 years ago.

273
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,160
There was something very important

274
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,660
that I was supposed to have taught you.

275
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,160
Something more important than studying.

276
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,760
But, maybe I can't really teach you much

277
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,560
since I'm separated with my wife and all now.

278
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,960
True.

279
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,060
But, it's never too late.

280
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,360
Repent for the crime that you have committed

281
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,760
and study all over again.

282
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,960
This time, the study of life!

283
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,060
Will you watch over me then again?

284
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,560
Sure. By all means.

285
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,560
"Mouri Detective Agency"

286
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,560
It's a good thing that the case was solved, but...

287
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:15,860
This case must've really come as a shock to Pops.

288
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,460
Yes, the Mouri Detective Agency.

289
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,760
What? Yoko?

290
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,160
A concert? Of course, I'll go.

291
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,260
If for you, I'll go and cheer for you or tutor.

292
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,160
I'll do anything you wish! Yes!

293
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,760
I guess we've got nothing to worry about...

294
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,260
Really. It takes Pops no time at all to get back on his feet.

295
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,160
"Next episode" -It bothers me.

296
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,560
I met him somewhere, but I can't remember where.

297
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,860
A MO disc?

298
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,560
What's this?

299
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,760
I don't remember buying this.

300
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,260
The old man who disappeared.

301
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,760
The man wearing sunglasses.

302
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,560
Something... something smells fishy!

303
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,060
Next Conan,

304
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,880
"The Old Man Disappears"

305
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:20,070
Next Conan's Hint:

306
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,770
"Window Glass"

307
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,970
The next episode has to do with a mysterious old man.

308
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,870
Gosh, the young people nowadays...

309
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,970
That's what they all say when they get old.
