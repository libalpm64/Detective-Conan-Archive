1
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,430
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,330
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,930
Today's episode is a unique type of mystery story.

4
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,130
Flourishing business is the entrance to a criminal case.

5
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,630
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,530
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,730
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:04,160
"The Secret To A Successful Business"

9
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,860
"Teitan Elementary School"

10
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,760
A suspicious man?

11
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,960
Your family has a diner's business, right?

12
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,860
I know. Manpuku Diner's.

13
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,760
The shop is dark, dirty

14
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,460
and because everything tastes lousy, it's always empty.

15
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,960
Oh, I'm sorry.

16
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,360
And, in what way is that man suspicious?

17
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,860
He suddenly came around 2 months ago.

18
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,060
My name is Yuji Kamekura.

19
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,960
I owe the shop owner who passed away my gratitude.

20
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,060
To my deceased husband?

21
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,760
What kind of gratitude?

22
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,760
It's something so great that I could never express it in words.

23
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,060
So, in order to pay the master back,

24
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,660
I'm wondering if you'd let me stay here

25
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,160
and work for you as a token of my gratitude, yes.

26
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,460
You mean you want us to let you live here?

27
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,360
We can't afford hiring anyone.

28
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
I'm not asking to be paid.

29
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,560
I just want to pay him back for what he did for me.

30
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,260
Please let me.

31
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,660
Okay, I've got to get to work.

32
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,860
So saying, he forced his way into our house.

33
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,960
But, something is definitely strange.

34
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,160
Because grandpa who passed away, was stingy

35
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,360
and had a bad personality.

36
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,760
He would never do a favor for anybody.

37
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,760
I'm sure that man is up to something.

38
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,760
That's why

39
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,560
I want the Youth Detective Squad to find out what it is.

40
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,960
Shoots. I thought it was going to be an interesting case,

41
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,460
but it's nothing but a liar trying to freeload.

42
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,760
I smell something super fishy that made lead to a crime.

43
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,260
-Same here. -I do too.

44
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,960
Yes, it smells, really smells super fishy.

45
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,860
Haibara?

46
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,460
All right. It's show time for the Youth Detective Squad!

47
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,660
Give it all you've got, Edogawa,

48
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,360
because I unfortunately have other commitments.

49
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,960
Bye-bye.

50
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,960
Hey, don't walk away like that, no fair, Haibara.

51
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,960
What? You mean, this is Manpuku Diners?

52
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,760
-So, what? -The shop's so pretty now.

53
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,260
Look at all those customers.

54
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,860
It's because of that man.

55
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,560
We got no customers at all again today.

56
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,160
As usual...

57
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,860
After all, there are loads of delicious and nice diners so...

58
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
We can't go on like this.

59
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,660
Okay. I have experience as a cook

60
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,960
so I'll give you special training in cooking.

61
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,560
And, let's renovate the shop

62
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,960
to make it brighter and more cheerful.

63
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,360
Renovate the shop?

64
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,460
I'll dish out all the cash.

65
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,360
Please don't be hesitant because all I want to do is

66
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,060
repay the favor that was done for me.

67
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,760
And the shop started doing unbelievably good.

68
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,460
What's so suspicious about all that?

69
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,360
He dished out his own money to renovate the shop

70
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,760
as a token of his gratitude, right?

71
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,760
He's a nice man.

72
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,760
I got it.

73
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,260
He's going to make good business

74
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,960
and split after taking all the money.

75
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,260
Is that what the man's thinking?

76
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,260
If he wants to split with the cash,

77
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,260
why should he help the shop make money, then steal it?

78
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,660
Wouldn't it be faster for him to pick

79
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,160
a flourishing shop to begin with?

80
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,260
Oh, yeah.

81
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,260
Smell of a crime, my foot.

82
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,560
-Just what does that mean? -What?

83
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,560
Researching new menu, absolutely off-limits, Kamekura.

84
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,660
The man's in the room from morning to night

85
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,860
thinking up new menus.

86
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,060
He won't even let us in, saying that it is a secret

87
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,260
until he completes the menu.

88
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,060
Rintaro!

89
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,360
We're busy, so if you're home, you've gotta help.

90
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,060
Come on, say bye-bye to your friends.

91
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,760
I see.

92
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,460
If the shop gets busy, the members of the family

93
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,260
will have to stay at the shop all day.

94
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,960
In the meantime, the one who proposed all this

95
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,260
stays secretly confined to his room.

96
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,360
This sure sounds like the pattern of The Red-Headed League?

97
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,260
It can't be.

98
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,460
I've got it.

99
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,560
I'm sure that this is the pattern of the Red-Headed League.

100
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,460
Oh, The Red-Headed League.

101
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,960
What's that?

102
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,860
The Red-Headed League is one of the most famous

103
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,660
among the 600 stories of Sherlock Holmes.

104
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,960
A man who sneaks into a shop as an employee,

105
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,560
gets the shop owner to step out of the shop

106
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,760
by telling a clever lie.

107
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,260
In the meantime, he digs a tunnel underground towards the bank

108
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,960
in an attempt to rob it.

109
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,560
It is a masterpiece that describes

110
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,960
a very bold and bizarre crime.

111
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,560
Thanks for the explanation.

112
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,660
But, I'd like to add that it was written

113
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,460
more than a hundred years ago.

114
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,760
I wonder where in the world today

115
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,960
you can find a criminal so patient

116
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,060
who'd dig a tunnel in order to steal valuables.

117
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,860
What are you guys doing?

118
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,860
If he's digging a tunnel, we should be able to hear something.

119
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,760
Stop acting silly.

120
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,460
I'll go check it out for you!

121
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,160
Check it out?

122
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,160
-Is he the one? -Yes.

123
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,560
What is it, Rintaro?

124
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,960
Well...

125
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,860
We're sorry to bother you when you're busy.

126
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,860
You must be the God of Fortune because the minute you came,

127
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,360
the shop is so busy.

128
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,160
I came wanting to see what the palm of the God of Fortune looks like.

129
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,760
The palm of my hand?

130
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,560
Oh. Sure.

131
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,360
Go ahead and take a look at it.

132
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,960
This is...

133
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,960
This can't be... hey.

134
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,660
Hey, it was, wasn't it? The hand of a criminal?

135
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,360
That's not what I checked for.

136
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,760
He had a lot of blisters and callus on his hand.

137
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,060
It's the hand of one who uses a shovel.

138
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,560
It's hard to believe

139
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,060
but I'm sure he's digging a hole under the house.

140
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,860
I told you so.

141
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,960
You're fantastic, Mitsuhiko.

142
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,260
Too bad Mitsuhiko got the credit this time.

143
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,760
But can something like this really be happening?

144
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,060
The thing is,

145
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,860
where is the tunnel that he's digging headed towards?

146
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,260
Conan?

147
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,360
I see.

148
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,060
The closest bank from Manpuku Diners is here.

149
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,160
But, it's closed.

150
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,760
This bank's been closed down since a week ago.

151
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,660
So, it can't be here.

152
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,260
Wrong again. You seem to have swung at air again, Conan.

153
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,260
Another place near here that could be a target would be...

154
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,160
There's a jewelry shop.

155
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,460
It's impossible for any thief

156
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,460
to steal anything from our shop.

157
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,160
Because this place is protected by a fail-proof security system,

158
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,060
thanks to a bitter experience in the past.

159
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,460
A bitter experience in the past?

160
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,360
We've been robbed before

161
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,360
of 3 billion yen worth of jewelry

162
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,360
and the robber hasn't been arrested yet.

163
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,760
A jewel thief and the thief hasn't been arrested yet?

164
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,760
Maybe this could be...

165
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,360
When were you robbed?

166
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,460
Next month makes it exactly 5 years ago.

167
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,860
I guess not, then.

168
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,960
A jewel thief

169
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,660
and a suspicious man who is secretly digging a hole underground.

170
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,060
This could be...

171
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,960
Mitsuhiko?

172
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,460
Hey, Mitsuhiko,

173
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,060
don't tell me that you're thinking that.

174
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,760
Mitsuhiko!

175
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,160
Well, I've got to go because I'm busy.

176
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,960
Thank you.

177
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,560
What were you asking her, Mitsuhiko?

178
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,860
I've solved the mystery.

179
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:42,560
That man called Mr. Kamekura is the one

180
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,460
who stole the jewelry from that jewelry shop

181
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,860
we just went to 5 years ago.

182
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,560
-He's the jewel thief? -Really?

183
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,760
I'm sure my deduction is correct.

184
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,460
I thought so.

185
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,860
But, that deduction's a bit too farfetched.

186
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,560
However, the thief is no dunce.

187
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,260
If he sells the loot immediately, he'll be caught,

188
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,660
and it would also be too risky to keep the loot

189
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,060
with him right through.

190
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,160
Therefore, he buried the loot somewhere

191
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,560
right after he stole it, for the time being.

192
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,660
He happened to bury the loot right

193
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,760
under Rintaro's house that was being re-built back then.

194
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,760
The house was being re-built?

195
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,660
Oh, so that's what you were asking the lady a while ago.

196
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,560
Right. So, Kamekura forced his way into the house

197
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,860
as a live-in employee, in order to gradually dig out the loot.

198
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,960
Mitsuhiko, you're awesome.

199
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,060
What a perfect deduction.

200
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,760
I mean, it's not that much of a big deal.

201
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,660
No need to be shy, renown detective.

202
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,260
Why would he want to dig it out now,

203
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,660
after leaving it buried for 5 years?

204
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,960
Don't you get it, Conan?

205
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,160
He was waiting for the statute to expire.

206
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,460
The period of prescription expires in 5 years.

207
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,560
Which means he can soon hold his head up high

208
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,360
and sell the loot off.

209
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,360
That only goes for criminal cases.

210
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,460
The period of expiration for civil affairs is 20 years.

211
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,060
Which means even if he digs it out now,

212
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,860
he won't be able to own the jewelry.

213
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,860
We don't know of such complicated rules.

214
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,360
If we don't know about it,

215
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,760
I'm sure the thief doesn't either.

216
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,560
Hey.

217
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,960
You're just argumentative by nature, aren't you, Conan?

218
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,960
Mom always tells me that

219
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,560
it's important for people to accept things without argument.

220
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,060
That's not the point.

221
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:43,960
Let's go tell the police that he's actually a jewelry thief.

222
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,960
Don't! There's no evidence!

223
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,760
You'll just end up embarrassing yourselves!

224
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,760
Shoots, okay.

225
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,660
All we've got to do is catch him in the act, right?

226
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,360
Just what do you intend to do?

227
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,160
I'm going to set up a trap.

228
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,960
A trap. Hey.

229
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,270
"Manpuku Diner"

230
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,470
Oh, it's you.

231
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,170
You want to see my palm again?

232
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,570
We know about everything.

233
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,570
What?

234
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,570
You can deceive the eyes of we the Youth Detective Squad.

235
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,070
Good-bye.

236
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,770
Good-bye.

237
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:40,570
So, now all we do is wait for him to fall for it.

238
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,270
What kind of trap is that supposed to be?

239
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,370
He'll panic, get flustered

240
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,270
and commit himself right away, for sure.

241
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,770
Sure.

242
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,270
It's perfect.

243
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,070
Where in the world would there be an adult who'd panic

244
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,370
just because some grade schooler takes a jab at him?

245
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,170
"The Next Morning"

246
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,570
What? Your whole family

247
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,370
is going on a 2 days 1 night hot spring trip?

248
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,470
Yeah, Mr. Kamekura suddenly recommended

249
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,670
father and the others to take a trip.

250
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,270
He said that we should go on a trip and relax

251
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,770
since we haven't had a day of rest

252
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:13,470
after the shop started getting busy.

253
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,870
And of course Mr. Kamekura's not going, right?

254
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,770
Right, he says just our family should go and enjoy ourselves.

255
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,870
He's making the entire family leave the house

256
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,670
and then is planning to dig it out all at once.

257
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,670
I'm sure that's it.

258
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,470
Like I told you, Conan, he fell right for the trap

259
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,870
and started making his move.

260
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,170
It can't be.

261
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,270
Can this really be happening?

262
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:45,870
I don't have the slightest idea what's going on.

263
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,070
You seem to be completely lost.

264
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,770
Well, where in the world are there criminals

265
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,070
that will make moves just because they're pushed from behind

266
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,470
by a bunch of grade school kids?

267
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,570
And, there are other things that I don't get either, like...

268
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,170
Kudo, maybe the man you're dealing with

269
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:07,670
is very different from the criminals that you've handled so far.

270
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,870
In what way?

271
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,870
He's an unsophisticated person.

272
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,970
It's even harder to understand!

273
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:21,770
Conan seems to have lost a lot of confidence.

274
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,970
Yeah, he's so off this time.

275
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,770
I hope he doesn't get sulky and become a juvenile delinquent.

276
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,270
It's possible.

277
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:33,470
That doesn't sound good at all.

278
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,770
"Temporarily Closed"

279
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,670
Are you sure you don't want to come along?

280
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,470
No, because a friend of mine

281
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,670
has been bugging me to spend the night at his place.

282
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,570
Have a nice trip.

283
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,870
In the past, going on a trip to a hot spring was unthinkable,

284
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,070
even for a day.

285
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,570
This is all thanks to business flourishing.

286
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,370
Rather, to Mr. Kamekura.

287
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,570
I'm really glad that such a good man has come.

288
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:04,770
Okay, everyone's left.

289
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:08,070
Now, all we have to do is wait for Mr. Kamekura to come home.

290
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,070
Are you going to wait one whole night if he doesn't come back?

291
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,770
What are you going to tell your parents?

292
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,070
He's back.

293
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,970
So, we go in there when the time is right

294
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,170
and use this key that I borrowed from Rintaro to go inside,

295
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,970
and catch Kamekura in the act.

296
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,370
I see.

297
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,070
Conan, you're not your spirited self.

298
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,970
I've been digging day after day,

299
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,270
but I haven't seen a glimpse of anything.

300
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:53,070
I shouldn't have buried it so deep.

301
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,170
There it is.

302
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,070
I did it.

303
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,870
I did it, the loot, the loot.

304
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,370
That's it, mister.

305
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:19,570
We have clearly confirmed the jewelry that have been buried.

306
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,170
I'm sorry.

307
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,570
Oh, well, we're not the police.

308
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,370
Come on, Conan.

309
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,970
Huh? Come on, what?

310
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,270
Aren't you going to thrust your deduction at the criminal?

311
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,370
We'll let you have the best part.

312
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,570
Because you had no room for highlight this time.

313
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,070
I've got nothing to thrust at him.

314
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,670
Come, get on with it.

315
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,670
Give it your best shot, Conan.

316
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:56,770
Mr. Kamekura, 5 years ago, you broke into a jewelry shop

317
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:00,170
and stole 3 billion yen worth of jewelry.

318
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,070
Exactly.

319
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,470
See, he admits it.

320
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,070
But, I'm no dunce.

321
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:10,770
I knew that if I sold them off right away, I would be caught, so...

322
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,770
I had my eyes fixed on

323
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,070
the re-building construction that was underway.

324
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,270
I buried the jewelry under the floor and fled.

325
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:25,470
Then, I worked day after day so the police wouldn't suspect me.

326
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:29,570
I endured everything, being shouted at, being hit and all.

327
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,870
All my friends couldn't bear the apprenticeship

328
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,470
and quit one after the other.

329
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,470
But I stuck it out.

330
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,770
Thinking, 5 years. After 5 years,

331
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:41,070
the 3 billion yen worth of jewelry will be mine.

332
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,870
This was what had kept me

333
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:47,470
going through all the tough times.

334
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,770
And, finally the 5 years that I've waited for all this time had come.

335
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,570
I just couldn't wait till the time expired,

336
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:56,170
I just had to dig it up as soon as possible.

337
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,770
You figured that if you worked here as a live-in employee,

338
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,970
you'd have the chance to dig it out.

339
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,870
But, it didn't go that easily.

340
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,270
Since there were no customers, the shop was always slow

341
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,970
and the members of the family

342
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,970
were always rolling around on the floor.

343
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:15,770
If this keeps up, you'll never get around to digging up the loot.

344
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,870
Having no other choice, you renovated the shop

345
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,870
with the money you had saved working,

346
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:24,470
taught them the cooking that you had learned under apprenticeship,

347
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,670
and by making business flourish,

348
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:32,470
you succeeded in chasing the entire family out of the living room.

349
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,870
You were finally able to work on digging up

350
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,370
the jewelry that you buried.

351
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:42,470
Isn't that right, Mr. Yuji Kamekura?

352
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,470
It's exactly as you say.

353
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,970
-And I thought so. -Our deduction was right on the ball.

354
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,970
I just can't figure it out, please tell me.

355
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,170
Why did you rush to dig it up,

356
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:56,570
just because a bunch of grade school kids pushed you from behind?

357
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,870
I'm really chicken.

358
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,870
Even if you're only in grade school,

359
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,070
the minute I heard that you guys were the detective squad,

360
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,870
I got scared.

361
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,370
I see.

362
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,570
What's there to be afraid of?

363
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,170
An adult being afraid of a detective squad

364
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,270
made up of a bunch of pip-squeak kids!

365
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,370
If you had thought up sending them off to a hot spring trip,

366
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,370
why didn't you carry it out in the first place?

367
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,170
It would've been faster, cheaper and easier

368
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,770
if you just gave them a voucher for a trip

369
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,070
and send the whole family off, than to go out of your way,

370
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,670
dish cash out of your own pocket, renovate the shop,

371
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,970
and help it flourish!

372
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,370
Oh, that's true.

373
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,970
That's right.

374
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,470
I guess so, now that you mentioned it.

375
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,070
You guess so?

376
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,070
It never even dawned on me.

377
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,570
What?

378
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,670
I guess the case is closed.

379
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,470
Haibara?

380
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,070
Convinced?

381
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,870
Haibara.

382
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,470
Didn't I tell you that

383
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:58,470
the person you're dealing with this time is unsophisticated?

384
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,770
They've come. I called them.

385
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,170
I wonder if they'll award us with

386
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,870
the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Commissioner Award?

387
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,670
It would be nice if they did.

388
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,070
Sure would.

389
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,770
I'm pretty sure they will.

390
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,970
After all, you've carried out a fantastic good deed.

391
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,270
Really?

392
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,370
I suppose we did.

393
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,470
I hate this.

394
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:29,370
I don't feel a least bit good even after the case is solved.

395
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:33,970
I hate it!

396
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,770
We received a letter of thanks award from the police

397
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:06,170
for cooperating in the arrest of a jewelry thief

398
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:09,570
just before his duration of prescription was about to expire.

399
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,970
We did it, didn't we?

400
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:16,170
Yep. It was really easy this time.

401
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:20,270
I've got something I'd like to tell you guys.

402
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,970
Not all the criminals are going to be a fool like this one.

403
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,170
It's dangerous just barging in, just us kids.

404
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,970
Be more careful next time, understand?

405
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:33,770
Huh? You sure don't sound like your usual self, Conan.

406
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:38,470
Conan, so you're that vexed that we got the upper hand this time?

407
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:43,770
Genta. Don't talk like that because Conan is hurt.

408
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,170
Conan, cheer up.

409
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:50,870
I'm so sorry, Conan. That's a good boy.

410
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:55,670
You idiot. I'm a specialist of decent crimes

411
00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:00,670
where brains clash against brains and emit sparks!

412
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,380
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,460
"Game characters"

414
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,420
Sonoko will appear in the next episode after a long absence.

415
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,800
Hi, long time no see. I'm Sonoko.

416
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:42,390
Who are you?
