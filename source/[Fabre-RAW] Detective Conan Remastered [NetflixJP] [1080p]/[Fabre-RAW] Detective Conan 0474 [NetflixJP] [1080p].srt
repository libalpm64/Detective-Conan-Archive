1
00:00:03,601 --> 00:00:05,501
Anniversary.

2
00:00:05,501 --> 00:00:07,501
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:09,001
This never happened before.

4
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:12,401
Ran explodes at her mother who takes off her wedding ring.

5
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:13,801
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:15,301
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:17,501
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:36,667
Ms. Kuriyama, please answer the door.

9
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,067
Ms. Kuriyama.

10
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:51,067
Ms. Kuriyama...

11
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:52,367
That's right.

12
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:55,067
She's out doing an errand for me.

13
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:04,867
Yes!

14
00:03:04,867 --> 00:03:08,067
But who could it be, so early in the morning?

15
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:15,867
Huh?

16
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:18,867
Congratulations! Mother!

17
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:20,267
Ran?

18
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,367
And Conan, you too?

19
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:28,267
Well? Congratulations for what?

20
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:30,667
Don't tell me you forgot?

21
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:32,567
It's your anniversary.

22
00:03:32,567 --> 00:03:34,667
Anniversary?

23
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:36,767
It's not my birthday.

24
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:38,067
Not that.

25
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:40,167
Today is your... Remember, remember...

26
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:42,967
Today is the day you and dad dated for the first time.

27
00:03:42,967 --> 00:03:45,267
It's the anniversary of your first date!

28
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:50,567
What's with the excitement?

29
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:52,667
I was cleaning up the bookshelf last night

30
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:55,167
and found an old album.

31
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:56,467
Other than the pictures,

32
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:59,267
I found a lot of things handwritten by you, mom.

33
00:03:59,267 --> 00:04:01,867
First hand-made dish anniversary.

34
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,367
First argument anniversary.

35
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:07,267
Dad's first successful job anniversary.

36
00:04:07,267 --> 00:04:09,267
Right, Conan?

37
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:11,267
Oh, yeah.

38
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:14,767
I guess you could call it the indiscretions of youth.

39
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:17,167
So as your daughter,

40
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:19,767
I thought I should congratulate you on this anniversary.

41
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:21,867
Sorry.

42
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:25,267
I'm afraid I just don't happen to be in the mood

43
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:27,767
to linger on the memory of such an old mildewed story of the past.

44
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:36,667
"Attorney Eri Kisaki Falls in Love"

45
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:42,067
And next time,

46
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:45,067
please don't bring me flowers again.

47
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:47,567
Because he'll eat them.

48
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:51,867
There seems to be flowers that are poisonous to cats.

49
00:04:51,867 --> 00:04:53,767
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:56,867
Then I guess I'll decorate them in the bathroom here.

51
00:04:57,767 --> 00:04:59,367
Let's see...

52
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:03,067
A flower vase...

53
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:07,767
Will you get that vase for me, Conan?

54
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:10,967
Okay.

55
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:14,367
Here goes.

56
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:17,667
No, not this.

57
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:21,667
Can you use the flower vase that's on the shelf?

58
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:24,567
Okay.

59
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:25,567
Hey...

60
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:28,567
Are you angry about something?

61
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:29,867
Huh?

62
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:31,867
No, I'm not.

63
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:34,867
But you seem a bit annoyed since we came here.

64
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:45,667
Hello.

65
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:47,567
This is the Kisaki Law Office.

66
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:51,567
What? Right now?

67
00:05:53,467 --> 00:05:55,267
Yes, I don't mind.

68
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:57,367
Thank you very much!

69
00:05:57,367 --> 00:05:59,067
I'll be right over then.

70
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,867
Yes. Yes.

71
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:04,067
I'm sorry, Ran.

72
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:06,067
I'm going out for a while.

73
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:14,867
Please take care of Goro for me, okay?

74
00:06:14,867 --> 00:06:16,867
It's just about time for him to use the litterbox.

75
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:23,467
I'm sure Ms. Kuriyama will be back soon, too.

76
00:06:29,467 --> 00:06:30,867
I wonder who it was?

77
00:06:30,867 --> 00:06:32,567
The person who called her on the phone.

78
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:34,767
I don't know.

79
00:06:34,767 --> 00:06:38,067
Maybe it's some lawyer that she owes something to?

80
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:45,567
Oh, hey! Don't go in there!

81
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,767
Don't go in there, kitty.

82
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:54,767
Huh? A picture?

83
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:57,067
It must've been inside this vase.

84
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:04,467
I wonder who's the man in the picture with mom.

85
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:09,967
He must be the one who just called her a while ago.

86
00:07:09,967 --> 00:07:12,467
Huh? Why do you say that?

87
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:15,467
There's a phone number written in back of the picture, right?

88
00:07:17,867 --> 00:07:22,667
It's the same phone number in the calls history list.

89
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:27,667
But this man sure doesn't look like a lawyer

90
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:31,567
that she owes something to, does he?

91
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:34,667
I guess not.

92
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:39,667
It couldn't be that mother was hiding this picture,

93
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,567
that's why she didn't want me to use this vase, could it?

94
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:45,467
I think your imagination is getting the better of you.

95
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:48,167
But there's only trash inside!

96
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,667
I'm sure she set it up, so if I looked in here,

97
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:52,467
she could claim it was a waste paper basket.

98
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:57,567
Her wedding ring.

99
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:01,867
Come to think of it, she wasn't wearing her ring.

100
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:08,767
Which means that maybe...

101
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:11,567
She's having an affair?

102
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:14,467
Let's go after her, Conan!

103
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:18,067
I think we can still make it if we go now!

104
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:19,567
Huh?

105
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:25,367
I'm back.

106
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:28,167
Huh?

107
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:31,067
Ms. Kisaki? Ms. Kisaki?

108
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:34,967
The vase is on the floor

109
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:37,367
and trash is scattered,

110
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:40,467
and a mysterious bouquet of flowers.

111
00:08:41,867 --> 00:08:44,067
I smell a case.

112
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,367
I guess not.

113
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:00,467
All right.

114
00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:01,467
Conan!

115
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:03,967
Yeah. I'll be right there!

116
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:11,767
There she is!

117
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:13,367
There's no doubt about it.

118
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:16,067
It's that guy...

119
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:17,367
Ran.

120
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:23,067
Welcome. A table for two?

121
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:24,667
Oh, yes.

122
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:31,967
But why?

123
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:33,667
Why would mother...

124
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:37,967
There's no use thinking.

125
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:40,167
I'll go ask her directly.

126
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:42,967
Why don't you wait and see?

127
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:46,867
We don't know if he's a bad guy or not.

128
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:48,767
Well, that's true...

129
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:55,167
Meg.

130
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:57,367
You're as beautiful as ever, sweechi.

131
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:00,367
Thank you!

132
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,067
Sweechi?

133
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:04,967
What's with the baby talk?

134
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:08,467
But he doesn't look like her love mate.

135
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:11,767
I don't think he is Ms. Kisaki's type.

136
00:10:11,767 --> 00:10:14,867
But Dad also does that when he gets drunk.

137
00:10:14,867 --> 00:10:19,667
"Ran, sweechi. Could you get me another drinky?"

138
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:21,967
I mean, he baby talks a lot.

139
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:25,467
And everyone knows that dad likes women.

140
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:29,267
So although very unlikely, he could be mom's type.

141
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:34,367
Look, Conan!

142
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:37,967
Look at the guy's arm.

143
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:39,867
It's full of scratches.

144
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:43,767
I guess he's not that much of a good person after all.

145
00:10:44,867 --> 00:10:45,867
Oh, hey.

146
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:51,567
Mom.

147
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,567
She's shaking?

148
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,467
The shaking...

149
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:57,967
No matter what I do,

150
00:10:57,967 --> 00:10:59,467
the shaking won't stop.

151
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:03,567
She's crying.

152
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:08,067
Mom rarely ever sheds tears.

153
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:13,267
Why would she...

154
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:15,567
cry over a womanizer, baby talker like him?

155
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:17,667
Why him?

156
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:20,667
Wait a second.

157
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:24,567
The picture, trash and ring that were hidden in the vase,

158
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:27,567
the impulsive baby talk,

159
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:30,167
the many scratches on his arm,

160
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:33,667
and the words that came out with tears,

161
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:35,167
"The shaking won't stop."

162
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:39,967
How can I...

163
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,467
Don't worry.

164
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,767
I'm sure it's just a dream.

165
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,967
It's all just a dream.

166
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:48,767
Huh?

167
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:52,967
So after seducing mom and making her cry,

168
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:55,267
he's convincing her that it was just a dream and dumping her!

169
00:11:56,267 --> 00:11:58,167
I won't forgive him.

170
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:03,167
I'll never forgive that guy!

171
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:14,656
I see. So that's what it was.

172
00:12:14,656 --> 00:12:18,456
If my deduction is correct, that guy is...

173
00:12:18,456 --> 00:12:20,456
From the way he baby talks,

174
00:12:20,456 --> 00:12:23,956
the many scratches on his arms

175
00:12:23,956 --> 00:12:26,956
and the fact that she's meeting him at a place like this.

176
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:32,756
Her shedding tears in front of him saying, "The shaking won't stop."

177
00:12:32,756 --> 00:12:35,456
And the reply he gave her.

178
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:39,456
Don't worry. I'm sure it's just a dream.

179
00:12:39,456 --> 00:12:41,656
It's all just a dream.

180
00:12:41,656 --> 00:12:45,456
Everything falls into place.

181
00:12:45,456 --> 00:12:49,156
The reason the wedding ring along with the crumpled papers

182
00:12:49,156 --> 00:12:53,656
was found inside the flower vase was probably...

183
00:12:55,456 --> 00:12:57,756
Ran, it's a mistake.

184
00:12:57,756 --> 00:13:00,556
That guy is not having an affair with your mother.

185
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,656
I won't forgive him.

186
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:07,856
That guy, never...

187
00:13:22,456 --> 00:13:24,056
Shoots!

188
00:13:24,056 --> 00:13:25,956
-Huh? -Huh?

189
00:13:25,956 --> 00:13:27,656
You've got it all wrong!

190
00:13:27,656 --> 00:13:28,656
Ran?

191
00:13:31,856 --> 00:13:32,956
That guy is...

192
00:13:34,156 --> 00:13:35,756
He's just a vet!

193
00:13:38,456 --> 00:13:39,756
A vet?

194
00:13:41,356 --> 00:13:45,256
This baby talk womanizer?

195
00:13:45,256 --> 00:13:48,356
I don't think he's a womanizer.

196
00:13:48,356 --> 00:13:52,756
But he was making passes to the woman just a while ago!

197
00:13:52,756 --> 00:13:55,856
Meg. You're as beautiful as ever, sweechi.

198
00:13:55,856 --> 00:13:56,956
Right?

199
00:13:56,956 --> 00:13:59,356
He wasn't saying that to the lady,

200
00:13:59,356 --> 00:14:03,556
but to the dog she was carrying.

201
00:14:03,556 --> 00:14:10,056
They say there are many vets who baby talk when examining animals.

202
00:14:10,056 --> 00:14:12,456
I think he just talked that way impulsively?

203
00:14:12,456 --> 00:14:14,856
Isn't that right, sir?

204
00:14:14,856 --> 00:14:16,156
Yeah.

205
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:20,756
By the way, the scratches on his arms were made by animals.

206
00:14:20,756 --> 00:14:24,356
Not all animals are quiet when they're being examined.

207
00:14:25,556 --> 00:14:29,256
Besides, he was also flipping over the dog's ear.

208
00:14:29,256 --> 00:14:30,756
Ear?

209
00:14:30,756 --> 00:14:32,156
Yeah.

210
00:14:32,156 --> 00:14:34,356
He was checking the inside of the ear

211
00:14:34,356 --> 00:14:38,356
and smelling it to see if the dog was sick or not.

212
00:14:38,356 --> 00:14:40,356
That's how I figured it out.

213
00:14:40,356 --> 00:14:43,156
Only a vet does something like that.

214
00:14:46,556 --> 00:14:50,256
I heard them saying that on a special program of vets on TV.

215
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,956
But you were crying, mom.

216
00:14:53,956 --> 00:14:55,956
You said you couldn't stop shaking.

217
00:14:55,956 --> 00:14:58,356
You were also shedding tears.

218
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:01,756
And he answered that it was a dream or something to that effect.

219
00:15:01,756 --> 00:15:04,256
How silly.

220
00:15:04,256 --> 00:15:08,956
I was talking about Goro, not me.

221
00:15:08,956 --> 00:15:10,456
Goro?

222
00:15:10,456 --> 00:15:16,056
Goro suddenly began twitching in his sleep.

223
00:15:16,056 --> 00:15:17,956
The twitching wouldn't stop for some time.

224
00:15:18,956 --> 00:15:22,356
The cats I had before have never acted like that.

225
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:26,756
I was worried sick that it might be some kind of illness.

226
00:15:26,756 --> 00:15:30,356
That's why I came to talk it over with Dr. Tobe.

227
00:15:30,356 --> 00:15:31,956
I was so busy with work

228
00:15:31,956 --> 00:15:35,056
and couldn't make it while his clinic was open,

229
00:15:35,056 --> 00:15:40,356
so I called to ask him if he could somehow make time for me somewhere.

230
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,756
And today he returned my call.

231
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:46,256
He told me there's a dog cafe that he visits every morning.

232
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:49,356
He would like to hear my concern out here.

233
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:53,356
You mean that was the call you got when we were at your office?

234
00:15:53,356 --> 00:15:55,156
Yes.

235
00:15:55,156 --> 00:15:57,256
I wanted to bring Goro here with me

236
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,156
and have Dr. Tobe examine him directly.

237
00:16:00,156 --> 00:16:03,256
But since this is a dog cafe...

238
00:16:03,256 --> 00:16:06,156
Then the dream was...

239
00:16:06,156 --> 00:16:08,956
It is the cause of the shaking.

240
00:16:08,956 --> 00:16:10,956
It happens sometimes.

241
00:16:10,956 --> 00:16:12,956
Some cats dream that they are playing in their sleep

242
00:16:12,956 --> 00:16:16,956
and twitch because their nerves react.

243
00:16:16,956 --> 00:16:21,256
Remember? Pops usually flings his arms up in joy when sleeping.

244
00:16:21,256 --> 00:16:22,556
It's the same thing.

245
00:16:22,556 --> 00:16:24,756
There it comes! It's a dark horse!

246
00:16:25,856 --> 00:16:27,856
Cats do stuff like that, too?

247
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:32,156
Yeah, cats and humans are alike in that aspect.

248
00:16:32,156 --> 00:16:33,656
They talk in their sleep, too.

249
00:16:35,556 --> 00:16:39,256
So, I don't think there's anything to worry about, Mrs. Mouri.

250
00:16:39,256 --> 00:16:42,156
I see. I'm glad.

251
00:16:42,156 --> 00:16:43,556
Really.

252
00:16:43,556 --> 00:16:46,156
But, mom, how terrible!

253
00:16:46,156 --> 00:16:49,756
How could you throw your wedding ring in the trash?

254
00:16:49,756 --> 00:16:51,256
Trash?

255
00:16:51,256 --> 00:16:54,056
The vase that I tried to put the flowers in this morning

256
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:56,656
and you told me not to.

257
00:16:56,656 --> 00:17:01,756
I found it thrown away along with crumpled paper after you left.

258
00:17:01,756 --> 00:17:05,256
I thought I lost it somewhere,

259
00:17:05,256 --> 00:17:08,656
but that's where it was.

260
00:17:08,656 --> 00:17:11,156
You mean you didn't put it in there?

261
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:13,756
That's Goro's toy box.

262
00:17:13,756 --> 00:17:16,856
Those crumpled piece of papers are Goro's toy.

263
00:17:16,856 --> 00:17:19,456
He plays soccer with them.

264
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,356
He's such a good boy

265
00:17:21,356 --> 00:17:25,056
that he puts everything inside that vase after he finishes playing.

266
00:17:25,056 --> 00:17:28,056
I did see him playing with that ring once.

267
00:17:28,056 --> 00:17:30,556
He must've found it on the desk or something

268
00:17:30,556 --> 00:17:32,756
and put it away together with the other things.

269
00:17:32,756 --> 00:17:36,356
He put Dr. Tobe's picture in there, too.

270
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:40,556
So you weren't the one who hid it there.

271
00:17:42,156 --> 00:17:43,456
I see.

272
00:17:43,456 --> 00:17:44,756
You thought that I hid the ring

273
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:48,556
and was seeing a man you didn't know.

274
00:17:49,556 --> 00:17:52,356
You thought I was having an affair?

275
00:17:55,056 --> 00:17:56,356
Yeah.

276
00:17:56,356 --> 00:18:00,456
Well, you looked sort of annoyed before you left.

277
00:18:00,456 --> 00:18:03,656
But after the phone call, you went out looking happy.

278
00:18:03,656 --> 00:18:05,556
I couldn't help it.

279
00:18:05,556 --> 00:18:08,156
I was worried about Goro

280
00:18:08,156 --> 00:18:12,456
and I didn't want to tell you because I didn't want to make you worry.

281
00:18:14,556 --> 00:18:18,156
Now that you know what's going on, go home!

282
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:22,556
You're going to the karate club camp this afternoon, right?

283
00:18:22,556 --> 00:18:24,156
Oh, right.

284
00:18:26,056 --> 00:18:27,056
She's scary.

285
00:18:32,556 --> 00:18:34,956
Nice meeting you. Goodbye!

286
00:18:34,956 --> 00:18:36,956
Conan!

287
00:18:36,956 --> 00:18:38,056
Let's go!

288
00:18:40,356 --> 00:18:41,956
Thank you.

289
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,056
Goodness.

290
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:47,056
But too bad.

291
00:18:48,856 --> 00:18:53,356
I was kind of expecting a kind of...

292
00:18:53,356 --> 00:18:56,456
love affair, you know?

293
00:18:56,456 --> 00:18:57,856
Huh?

294
00:19:02,856 --> 00:19:04,056
What's the matter?

295
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:08,856
Something about how mom's acting today bothers me.

296
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:12,456
She doesn't seem to be her usual self.

297
00:19:12,456 --> 00:19:15,756
Like she said, that's because she was worried about Goro.

298
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:18,356
No, that's not it.

299
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:20,456
She just didn't seem to be herself.

300
00:19:25,856 --> 00:19:27,156
So...

301
00:19:27,156 --> 00:19:30,656
That outfit you're wearing with the chest part being open like that.

302
00:19:30,656 --> 00:19:34,356
You usually don't dress like that.

303
00:19:34,356 --> 00:19:37,256
I thought that maybe you were using your cat

304
00:19:37,256 --> 00:19:40,556
as an excuse to come to see me.

305
00:19:42,656 --> 00:19:46,956
You know that I'm hurt over having separated from my wife last year.

306
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:50,156
Am I wrong?

307
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:51,956
Oh, well...

308
00:19:51,956 --> 00:19:54,756
That's not really...

309
00:19:54,756 --> 00:19:56,956
That's right! It's what she was wearing!

310
00:19:56,956 --> 00:20:00,956
She usually doesn't wear something provocative like that.

311
00:20:02,656 --> 00:20:06,456
I'm sure that mom did have some feelings for him after all.

312
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:07,956
Oh, wait.

313
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,356
I'm going back to that cafe again!

314
00:20:10,356 --> 00:20:11,656
Ran!

315
00:20:13,756 --> 00:20:14,756
Why did we go there?

316
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,556
Huh?

317
00:20:16,556 --> 00:20:18,656
Why did we go there?

318
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:24,456
Look. Why did we go to your mother's office?

319
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:25,756
Did you forget?

320
00:20:25,756 --> 00:20:27,856
We were cleaning the bookshelf

321
00:20:27,856 --> 00:20:30,456
and found an old album.

322
00:20:30,456 --> 00:20:33,756
Inside the album, there was a picture of mom and dad

323
00:20:33,756 --> 00:20:35,456
on their first date.

324
00:20:38,556 --> 00:20:40,456
The picture...

325
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:42,256
First date anniversary?

326
00:20:44,456 --> 00:20:46,356
You're wearing the same outfit you wore then?

327
00:20:46,356 --> 00:20:48,856
Yes. I'm a bit too old for this already, but...

328
00:20:50,556 --> 00:20:56,856
Today after work and after I had you examine Goro,

329
00:20:56,856 --> 00:21:00,956
I was planning to go to dinner with him.

330
00:21:00,956 --> 00:21:06,756
I figured if I met him wearing this outfit, we could laugh and make up.

331
00:21:06,756 --> 00:21:11,456
Then, why don't you two hurry and get back together again?

332
00:21:11,456 --> 00:21:14,156
It's not all that simple.

333
00:21:14,156 --> 00:21:18,056
Besides, my daughter found out that today was the day,

334
00:21:18,056 --> 00:21:21,656
so I pretended not to care.

335
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:24,756
I guess I'm going to call off my plan.

336
00:21:27,356 --> 00:21:29,956
What a lucky guy your husband is.

337
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:33,756
Having you think of him that much.

338
00:21:33,756 --> 00:21:36,056
Thank you.

339
00:21:36,056 --> 00:21:40,056
But I'm sure he's already forgotten.

340
00:21:41,356 --> 00:21:45,156
That nice day is an old memory after all.

341
00:23:11,956 --> 00:23:14,356
Hey, Kogoro!

342
00:23:19,756 --> 00:23:23,456
No good, he's totally wasted.

343
00:23:23,456 --> 00:23:24,656
Strange.

344
00:23:24,656 --> 00:23:29,756
Just until a few minutes ago, he was grumbling and glaring at his phone.

345
00:23:29,756 --> 00:23:33,256
I wonder why he's dressed up like this though.

346
00:23:33,256 --> 00:23:36,156
It's as if he's ready to go on a date or something.

347
00:23:37,256 --> 00:23:40,656
Look at him, all sprawled out.

348
00:23:40,656 --> 00:23:43,156
Gosh. I wonder who he took after.

349
00:23:45,556 --> 00:23:46,956
Really?

350
00:23:46,956 --> 00:23:49,056
I wonder who he took after.

351
00:23:55,256 --> 00:23:58,256
How can I focus on camp now?

352
00:24:46,756 --> 00:24:48,856
Next Conan's Hint:

353
00:24:48,856 --> 00:24:50,956
"Luck of a bad person"

354
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:52,456
Detective Conan is not going to be aired again next week.

355
00:24:52,456 --> 00:24:53,756
I wonder if I'm a jinx.

356
00:24:53,756 --> 00:24:55,556
After this break, there will be no break for a consecutive 10 weeks!
