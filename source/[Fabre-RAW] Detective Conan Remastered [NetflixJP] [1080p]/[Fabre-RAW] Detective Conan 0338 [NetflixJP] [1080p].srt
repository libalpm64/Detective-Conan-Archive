1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,540
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,740
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,440
Four Porsches just like the ones those guys have.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,540
The case far surpasses all expectations!

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,140
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,260
"Four Porsches (Part 1)"

9
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,360
Since she came back home, she's running a fever.

10
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,460
Hey, are you all right?

11
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,460
It's just a cold.

12
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,760
It's not something you have to go out of your way to come see me for.

13
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,760
So much has been going on recently

14
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,860
that she probably just psychologically tired.

15
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,860
By the way, are you okay?

16
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,360
What?

17
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,760
Remember the guys the other day that were tailing us?

18
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,860
If they tail you back here and find this house,

19
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,560
we'll get Dr. Agasa into trouble, too.

20
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,160
Don't worry. I wasn't tailed by anyone.

21
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,360
And nobody's watching over this house either.

22
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,460
She should go see a doctor, but...

23
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,360
Today is Sunday.

24
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,960
And the hospitals around here are all closed.

25
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,660
Right. We could ask Dr. Araide, what do you say?

26
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,560
Yes. I called him a while ago, but he wasn't in.

27
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,860
He's probably busy because the trial for that case is coming up.

28
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,760
Come to think of it, there's a hospital

29
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,160
inside the Tohto Department Store in Haidocho.

30
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,560
So maybe we should take her there.

31
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,760
If I remember correctly, their day off is Thursday.

32
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,160
You don't have to go out of your way to take me to the hospital.

33
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,360
Well, there's nothing better than

34
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,660
getting rid of your cold as soon as possible.

35
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,860
Like they say, colds may lead to all kinds of diseases.

36
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,560
What?

37
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,360
You mean we can't see her right away?

38
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,360
No. We have a lot of patients today.

39
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,960
You'll have to wait about two hours if you come now.

40
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,460
Well, it can't be helped.

41
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,060
Let's put in an appointment anyway, Dr. Agasa.

42
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,760
Excuse me. We'd like to make an appointment.

43
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,660
Yes.

44
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,460
I guess we can kill time in the department store then.

45
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,760
Yes. Thank you.

46
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,760
I guess so.

47
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,260
I'm getting kind of hungry, too.

48
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,960
There's the shop that is famous

49
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,160
for serving great egg porridge in the restaurant arcade here.

50
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,560
I'm sure that eating it will make Ai feel a little better

51
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,460
and start recovering.

52
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,660
Okay, Doc.

53
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,260
All right...

54
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,060
All right...

55
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,060
Stop.

56
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,860
Okay. We're here, Ai.

57
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,360
Here. Hang on to me.

58
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,760
You're still feeling unsteady, aren't you?

59
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,560
Hey. I'm not that hopeless, okay?

60
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,560
Never mind. Will you just move out of my way?

61
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,260
Yes.

62
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,960
I can manage to get off the car...

63
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,260
There you go again.

64
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,860
By myself.

65
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,160
Porsche.

66
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,860
356 A.

67
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,160
Gin's car.

68
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,860
Hey, Ai.

69
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,260
Hey, Ai.

70
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,160
Ai.

71
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,560
That is undoubtedly the same model as that of Gin's.

72
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,660
But his is black and this is green.

73
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,260
The color is different.

74
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,660
And besides,

75
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,860
since all three Porsches are parked so close together...

76
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,360
I'm sure that a bunch of Porsche lovers got together

77
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,460
to eat at the department store.

78
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,960
Another Porsche.

79
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,060
It's a 911.

80
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,660
Okay, we're here.

81
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,560
"Yoshihito Kureko (45)" -We're here, Mr. Banba.

82
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,960
Mr. Banba.

83
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,060
Darn. Another O.B.

84
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,060
"Yukiya Banba (41)" -Hopeless.

85
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,160
It's hopeless.

86
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,760
Well, it's not something unexpected though.

87
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,460
Okay then, why don't we do some shopping or something like always

88
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,060
until Banba's booze wears off?

89
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,560
Hold it.

90
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,460
Let me go back to the car and get my wallet.

91
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,560
Yes.

92
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,760
I guess I'll go, too.

93
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,760
Excuse me, mister.

94
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:01,360
Are the four Porsches parked here all yours?

95
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,860
Yes.

96
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,260
That green, old one is Mr. Hotei's.

97
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,960
"Eiji Hotei (39)" -Porsche 356 A.

98
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,460
The new car to the right edge

99
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,860
is Ms. Taiyama's Porsche Boxter.

100
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,660
"Kaoru Taiyama (34)"

101
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,160
And this is my dear car.

102
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,760
Porsche 911.

103
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,660
And this red one

104
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,260
is Porsche 928 that belongs to Mr. Banba

105
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,860
who is asleep in my car.

106
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,460
But why were all four men riding in your car?

107
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,960
Well, that's because...

108
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,760
We're all Porsche lovers

109
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
as well as friends who play golf together.

110
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,060
When all four of us go golfing, we gather here,

111
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,860
then take Kureko's car and head off together in one car.

112
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,160
The more the merrier

113
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,860
and the highway fee is cheaper that way, too.

114
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,060
Even the parking fee here is free

115
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,160
if we shop in this department store, too.

116
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,960
Besides, after we make half a round,

117
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,160
there's someone here who gulps down more beer.

118
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,160
By the time we're done, someone is completely drunk.

119
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,460
We have no other choice but go shopping or something

120
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,160
until he sleeps it off.

121
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,560
Well, this parking lot is crowded on Sunday

122
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,260
and it's difficult to find an open stall.

123
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,760
So it's like we're saving a stall for ourselves.

124
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,960
Hey, it's time we get going.

125
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
Yes.

126
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
See you.

127
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,860
Saving a stall?

128
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,960
I guess he means that nobody has guts enough

129
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,860
to park their car between two Porsches.

130
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,960
I see.

131
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,760
Okay, Ai. Shall we start off, too?

132
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,760
Ai?

133
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,460
Count me out.

134
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,860
What?

135
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,060
I don't feel too well.

136
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,360
So I guess I'll wait here in the car

137
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,060
until the time for my appointment with the doctor.

138
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,960
Hey, Ai.

139
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,260
It can't be helped.

140
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,260
She was tailed by people she doesn't know the identity of.

141
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,660
It's no wonder she's all worked up.

142
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,660
Which means that...

143
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,760
the ones who were tailing us were the Men in Black.

144
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,460
Could be, although I'm not all that sure myself yet.

145
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,760
I've got to at least find out

146
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,260
whether it's me or Ai that they're after.

147
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,860
Otherwise, I can't make any moves.

148
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,860
There was robbery in the Tokyo metropolitan area last night before dawn.

149
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,560
The killer is still on the run.

150
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,460
The police are collecting the information from an eyewitness.

151
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,360
Me or Ai?

152
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:02,990
I think it was the 10th floor.

153
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,990
I wonder if it's okay, though.

154
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,490
We left Ai back there alone.

155
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,190
We had no other choice, did we?

156
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,890
Kyoto type ramen.

157
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,690
They serve western style food here.

158
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,290
Italian food.

159
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,890
Chinese food.

160
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,190
There sure is a lot of variety, isn't there?

161
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:46,790
What is it?

162
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,390
Boy, what a long line.

163
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,790
Tarugatei.

164
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,090
Here it is.

165
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,690
Hey, hey. You got to be kidding.

166
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,590
Look at this line, Dr. Agasa.

167
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,190
Just as would be expected of a shop famous for egg porridge.

168
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,890
We can kill time just standing in line.

169
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,390
Huh?

170
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:22,490
Oh, no. I left my cell phone in the car.

171
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,190
I'll go get it.

172
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,690
You guys go on inside.

173
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,190
I'll be right back.

174
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,890
They're the people we just saw a while ago in the parking lot.

175
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,390
Hey!

176
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,590
Cool kid.

177
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,590
Long time no see.

178
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,990
Jo...

179
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,090
Jodie?

180
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,990
Ran and Sonoko, too.

181
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,290
-Hello. -Hello.

182
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,090
What's up?

183
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,790
What brings you here?

184
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,990
We came to eat the egg porridge of Tarugatei.

185
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,390
Bug you?

186
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,190
No, not at all.

187
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,190
I wasn't referring to you, Sonoko.

188
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,890
We told Jodie that it's really delicious.

189
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,290
Then she said she wanted to come and eat it.

190
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:14,290
Yes. Japanese food is healthy and very good.

191
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,790
I see.

192
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,990
And why are you both here, Conan?

193
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,990
You were saying that you were going to visit Ai

194
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,590
who is in bed with a cold.

195
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,690
Well...

196
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,190
Ai?

197
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,890
Yes. Actually, Ai was...

198
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:38,090
Going here with us to eat the egg porridge.

199
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,890
But her cold is so bad and she didn't look like she could make it.

200
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,490
So we left her behind.

201
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,390
Right, Dr. Agasa?

202
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,690
That's the story.

203
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,690
For those watching "Wild Sunday" at home,

204
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,190
please look at this.

205
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,490
Look at that long line of people.

206
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,590
This is the restaurant arcade inside the Tohto Department Store.

207
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,390
-The line you see... -See.

208
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,090
-is in front of Tarugatei. -It's even popular on TV.

209
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,290
So we had an urge to come eat here.

210
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,390
She's Tomomi Kato of the Gourmet Corner.

211
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,090
You're right.

212
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,990
Hey, hey. Listen to me, will you?

213
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,990
Okay, I'll start my interview right away.

214
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,990
The serial arsonist hasn't been arrested yet.

215
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,890
The Metropolitan Police Department is asking the people

216
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,390
in the vicinity to be very careful.

217
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,190
What I'm saying is that everyone was dumb.

218
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,790
Thank you very much.

219
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,190
So here is Yuka Mitsueda

220
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,490
with "The Place I Promised to Meet You".

221
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,990
And so let me go

222
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,890
and interview someone else now.

223
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,590
Boy, could I talk to you for a minute?

224
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,390
Did you come to here to Tohto Department Store to eat egg porridge, too?

225
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,790
Yes. But since there are so many people in line,

226
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,290
I guess I'm not.

227
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,090
Really? Is that right?

228
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:29,890
Did you come to eat egg porridge here at Tarugatei, too?

229
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,390
Yes.

230
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,490
That's it. We're leaving.

231
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,890
Come on, Dr. Agasa.

232
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,490
Let's go. Quick!

233
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,090
Hey!

234
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,490
Wait!

235
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,390
Hey.

236
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,690
Conan!

237
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,690
People go in and out of this shop quite quickly,

238
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,890
so you'll be able to eat soon.

239
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,890
Let them be, Ran.

240
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,190
Yes, but...

241
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,990
Kids wouldn't really know the difference in taste anyway.

242
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,790
Hey.

243
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,890
What's up?

244
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,290
All of a sudden.

245
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,890
Hey, Shinichi! Shinichi.

246
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,590
The person I saw a while ago.

247
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,790
He came back.

248
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,290
Dr. Agasa and Shinichi.

249
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,290
What's up?

250
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,490
Why does he look...

251
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,190
so dreadfully serious?

252
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:23,990
Shinichi!

253
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,390
Mr. Banba!

254
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,990
What is this?

255
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,890
What's the matter?

256
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,090
Shinichi.

257
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,590
No good.

258
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,290
He's been strangled.

259
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,590
Hello. Is this police?

260
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,690
I'm calling from the basement parking lot of the Tohto Department Store

261
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,690
from my cell phone.

262
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,790
-I'll stay back here. -Yes.

263
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,690
So take Ai and and get away from here, Dr. Agasa.

264
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,290
Why?

265
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,990
My face was taken by the TV cameras a while ago.

266
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:29,690
If the guys who were tailing us the other day were the Men in Black,

267
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,590
we can't be too sure that they won't come here after seeing me, right?

268
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,390
Don't worry.

269
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,190
The TV program just a while ago is the afternoon wide show.

270
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,690
The viewer rating is only about 10 percent.

271
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,990
It's not a live broadcast that's aired during golden time.

272
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,190
It's most probable that they're not watching.

273
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,390
Fool!

274
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,690
The number of TV viewers in the Kanto District

275
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,490
is approximately four million people.

276
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,090
Even if the viewer rating were to be one percent,

277
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,090
the number of people watching would be about 400,000.

278
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,090
10 percent makes it 4 million people.

279
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,490
There's no guarantee that they wouldn't be watching.

280
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,890
True.

281
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:10,390
So now that you understand, hurry and get Ai out of here.

282
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,790
If you look around Tokyo,

283
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,890
I'm sure you'll be able to find a hospital that is open even on Sunday.

284
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,390
I feel sorry for Ai.

285
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,490
But she'll just have to hold up till then.

286
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:35,090
"Tarugatei"

287
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,890
It sure rains a lot, doesn't it?

288
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,190
Hey, look.

289
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,290
There are police cars parked in front of this department store.

290
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,290
I wonder if something happened.

291
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:01,090
Don't tell me that the glasses kid

292
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,790
is messed up in some case again.

293
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,790
No way.

294
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:10,390
Seeing is believing.

295
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,890
Which means seeing is believing.

296
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,390
Shall we go check?

297
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:16,990
What?

298
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:22,490
Hey, how come you're not letting us out?

299
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,090
Well, we were contacted by the police a while ago.

300
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,390
There's been a grave incident inside this parking lot

301
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,890
that I can't let anyone out of here.

302
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,790
So now you know,

303
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:40,890
we can't get out of here until the killer is caught, Shinichi.

304
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,290
It can't be helped.

305
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:45,490
Find an empty lot and wait there.

306
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:48,890
But what if they come?

307
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,890
Don't worry. I'll solve the case right away.

308
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,890
Don't move till then.

309
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,390
Hey, Shinichi.

310
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,590
Shinichi.

311
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,790
Don't worry.

312
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:25,290
I'll solve the case right away.

313
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,900
Next Conan's Hint:

314
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,900
"Power Window"

315
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,160
Repeat after me.

316
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,460
Power window.

317
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,120
-Power window... -Yes.
