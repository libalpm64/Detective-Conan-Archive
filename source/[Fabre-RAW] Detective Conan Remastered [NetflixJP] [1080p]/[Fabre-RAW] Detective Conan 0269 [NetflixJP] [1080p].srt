1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,120
What lies in one's heart is a mystery to us all.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,120
Star and snow glitter on the two.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,820
Youth Detective Squad is looking for a lost wristwatch.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,020
We encountered a big case.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,720
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,520
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,020
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,480
It's so cute!

9
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,680
This is me.

10
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,980
All of them look just like us!

11
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,680
Are you sure it's okay for us to take these chocolates?

12
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,180
Yes! I made it with all my skills

13
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,480
at the lodge just for all of you!

14
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,380
When did you make this, though?

15
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,080
I didn't see it on the desk of the lodge.

16
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,680
I made it as I try-out at first

17
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,580
and kept it in the refrigerator!

18
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,380
I'll go make you some tea, so wait here, okay?

19
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,480
Okay...

20
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,180
Judging from the way she's acting,

21
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,480
it seems you somehow succeeded in getting the chocolate

22
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,980
from Ran who was in tears.

23
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,680
How'd you know she was in tears?

24
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,480
A creation reflects the heart of its creator.

25
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,480
Just take a look at this chocolate!

26
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,180
It's laughing but it has a sad face.

27
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,980
Now that you mentioned it...

28
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,880
Gosh, a face so sad that it seems as if

29
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,680
it's going to break out in tears any minute.

30
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,480
She's trying so hard.

31
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,980
You sometimes talk like a girl, don't you?

32
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,180
What? Do I look like a boy?

33
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,280
"Forgotten Keepsake of a Crime (Part 1)"

34
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,380
This is good!

35
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,880
You're right.

36
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,180
It's like chocolate that're sold in stores!

37
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,480
Would you mind holding the noise down a bit more?

38
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,480
I can't concentrate on my work.

39
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,080
Sorry...

40
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,580
We'll leave as soon as we drink our tea.

41
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,380
Are you really working?

42
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,780
I heard that you're always sleeping.

43
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,080
You idiot!

44
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,480
Can't you see that I'm listening to the tape of my client even now?

45
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,980
All the horses have started off at once...

46
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,980
What's that?

47
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,980
Horse racing, right?

48
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,280
Well, you see, this is...

49
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,880
Yes, one moment please.

50
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,280
See? The client's come just as expected!

51
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,380
What makes you think that a man like me who is bombarded

52
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,380
with job requests for investigations all over Japan

53
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,680
has spare time at all?

54
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,080
So, I wonder what kind of difficult case I'm dealing with today.

55
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,680
Welcome.

56
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,880
Well...

57
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,180
"Hideo Morita (49), Client" -I request a search for a lost wristwatch.

58
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,580
I see.

59
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,280
So the wristwatch you're looking for is your late wife's.

60
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,680
Yes.

61
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,680
It's an old hand-wind type wristwatch

62
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,580
that I sent my wife some time ago.

63
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,180
Why do you need the wristwatch now?

64
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,980
Your wife died, didn't she?

65
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,280
I get it! You want to take it to the pawn shop?

66
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,680
No.

67
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,480
My wife comes to my bed side night after night

68
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,280
and asks me, "What time is it now, dear?"

69
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,280
I... I'm sure you're just tired.

70
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,180
I think so too.

71
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,780
And? Did you lose it when you went out somewhere?

72
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,580
Or was it a thief or something?

73
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,780
Well, I think it's somewhere in the house.

74
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,980
What?

75
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,980
My wife was quite careless,

76
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,180
there were times when she was looking for her lipstick

77
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,780
that she left under some magazines for a whole day.

78
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,380
Therefore, I think that if I find the wristwatch,

79
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,380
she'll be able to rest in peace.

80
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,580
You must be kidding!

81
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,780
If it's in the house, go and look for it yourself!

82
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:37,280
But I'm just as careless as my wife.

83
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,480
I'm the renowned detective Kogoro Mouri, you know?

84
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,680
I can't be bothered with trivial stuff like that!

85
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,680
What? Mouri? You mean that famous "Sleeping Kogoro"?

86
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,580
He's planning to slack off!

87
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,880
He's like those snobbish shops that pick their customers.

88
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,180
There shouldn't be a case that's too big or too small to take on.

89
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,480
But if you insist you want to look for the wristwatch, then...

90
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,280
No, I'll look for someone else to do it for me.

91
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,580
I just happened to come across your sign outside and went in.

92
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,080
What?

93
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,880
Where'd the client and everybody go?

94
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,880
They've all disappeared somewhere.

95
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,780
Hey!

96
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,380
Shall we help you look for the wristwatch you lost?

97
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,180
Of course, we won't charge you for it.

98
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,480
Hello...

99
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,180
What beautiful flowers!

100
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,380
But some of them are bent.

101
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:04,380
Yes. These are flowers that my wife arranged before she died.

102
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,780
Even if I change the water every day,

103
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,680
the more days pass, the more they bend.

104
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,980
That means that it hasn't been that long since your wife passed away.

105
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,680
No, she passed away just three weeks ago

106
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,480
in a traffic accident.

107
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,080
What's with this room?

108
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,480
That's...

109
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,280
This is amazing!

110
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,680
It's full of audio equipment!

111
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,980
What a big television!

112
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,080
It's like a small little movie theatre, isn't it?

113
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,480
Hey, this is the English version of "Gomera", isn't it?

114
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,480
Yes! I went all the way to the States to buy it.

115
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,780
Videos, LDs, DVDs,

116
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,380
AV amp, as selector and TV monitor...

117
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,780
So many remote controls on the desk.

118
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,780
The floor is full of stacks of pamphlets.

119
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,080
It comes as no surprise that things might get lost here.

120
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,080
Well, the only messy room is this one.

121
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,980
What? It seems you have a guest.

122
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,680
Yes, it seems so.

123
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,480
Give it.

124
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,680
Do you have it?

125
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,280
Yes, five billion yen for now.

126
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,180
"Eiko Idezuki (46), Resident" -Five billion yen?

127
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,080
You're missing 15 billion yen?

128
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,180
I was thinking of selling this room to get the remainder ready.

129
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,280
Is that right?

130
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,980
I'm sorry that it sure looks like I'm evicting you or something.

131
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,280
And, just as a token of my appreciation to you

132
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,480
for having waited for me to return the money to you,

133
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,680
I found the video tape "Sakura Sanjuro"

134
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,480
that you've been looking for.

135
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,480
Really?

136
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,180
Then I hope you don't mind me viewing it right now

137
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,080
on this big screen here.

138
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,080
No, please do.

139
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,480
Oh, my. Who are these children?

140
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,480
Well...

141
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,780
Come now, all of you!

142
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,380
Never mind this room for now. Please search another room.

143
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,380
After you finish watching it, can you please return it

144
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,180
to the manager of the video tape shop in front of the station?

145
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,980
It seems to be a valuable video tape

146
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,980
that they don't even have at the shop.

147
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,780
Sure. Okay.

148
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,880
I was just going to go out anyway.

149
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,080
Then, please enjoy yourself.

150
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,180
Okay. I'll watch this enjoy myself

151
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,180
thinking it to be the interest for the money I lent you.

152
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,380
Which room shall we search next?

153
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,380
How about the living room then?

154
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,480
Secret technique of the sword, Sakura Fubuki!

155
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,980
The cherry blossoms are suddenly.

156
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,780
That lady is sure blasting the volume while watching.

157
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,580
It sure sounds like an interesting movie, though!

158
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,080
Hey... start looking for it, or the sun will start setting.

159
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,580
Okay.

160
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,280
But Haibara,

161
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,080
we've already searched all the room, yet nothing.

162
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,480
I'm so hungry I can't move.

163
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,180
Shall I make you some sandwiches then?

164
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,280
What?

165
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,680
I run a coffee shop in the next town,

166
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,280
so I've got the ingredients.

167
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,080
As a token of my appreciation to you for looking for the wristwatch,

168
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,780
let me make it for you!

169
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,080
-All right! -Thank you!

170
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,380
Shall I help you?

171
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,480
No, thanks.

172
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,780
I can handle it alone.

173
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,080
Okay, I guess we'll give it one last search

174
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,180
until the sandwiches are made.

175
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,680
Okay...

176
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,080
Here you go, eat to your heart's content.

177
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,080
It looks super delicious.

178
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,480
Clubhouse sandwiches!

179
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,880
Just as would be expected of a professional!

180
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,980
I wonder if anyone of you can take some sandwiches

181
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,780
over to Ms. Idezuki who is watching the movie?

182
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,780
I'll take it to her!

183
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,580
I'll go too, then!

184
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,380
Thank you.

185
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,680
I see. The Musashi of the Showa era.

186
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,880
You're cute.

187
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,080
But your sword is clouded with greed and ambition.

188
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,380
We brought you your tea and sandwich.

189
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,480
You can never slash Musashi.

190
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,680
This is the best part!

191
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,780
Just leave it on the desk.

192
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,780
Sakura Sanjuro comes. -Okay.

193
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,680
Did Ms. Idezuki say it tastes good?

194
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,680
No, she's watching the best part, so she'll eat it later.

195
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,680
Well, she's a movie-lover, so I guess it can't be helped.

196
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,780
What're those clothes in the plastic bag?

197
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:52,780
The laundry. I'm going to the coin laundry to wash them.

198
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,280
But there was a washing machine in the bathroom!

199
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,280
I don't know how to operate that washing machine without my wife

200
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,580
because it's sort of difficult to use.

201
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:05,180
Did your wife wear the wristwatch you're looking for all the time?

202
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,180
Yes, she liked it so much

203
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,480
that she had it on until the day

204
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,480
before she got into the accident.

205
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,080
She virtually never took it off.

206
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,680
But, she'd take it off when taking a bath, right?

207
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,480
Conan!

208
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,880
Here's the wristwatch!

209
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,380
It's moving just fine too!

210
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,980
What?

211
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,080
See!

212
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,880
Thank you!

213
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,880
This is my wife's wristwatch!

214
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,880
I see.

215
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,180
She probably took it off before taking a bath

216
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,280
and threw it inside the washing machine together with her clothes.

217
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,080
No, it was not.

218
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,580
That wristwatch wasn't lost to begin with!

219
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,680
Then, what is it?

220
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,680
Why is he making up a lie like this?

221
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,080
What is it? That's the sound of something cracking.

222
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,980
And the sound of somebody running.

223
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,680
Don't tell me that...

224
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,680
Hey, what was that sound?

225
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,680
Next, it's the sound of the front door closing.

226
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,480
The flower vase is gone?

227
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,480
What... what happened?

228
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,480
Hey, Conan?

229
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,980
Ms... Ms. Idezuki?

230
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,280
The murder weapon is the vase that had water and flowers in it.

231
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,380
The killer probably took the vase and snuck up from behind,

232
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,080
then attacked the victim with the vase.

233
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,780
One hit on the back of the head.

234
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,980
Beaten to death.

235
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,180
It seems that the victim Ms. Eiko Idezuki, 46 years old,

236
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,780
is a resident of this condo.

237
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,780
So the owner of this room, Mr. Hideo Morita.

238
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,980
What is the relationship between you and Ms. Idezuki?

239
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,780
She lent me money.

240
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,780
She came here today to get some of it back.

241
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,980
When I gave her the money

242
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,480
together with the video tape she had been looking for,

243
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,380
she said she wanted to watch it right away

244
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,480
and that's why she was in this audio room.

245
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,880
And you came to this room after you heard the vase crack,

246
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,480
then found Ms. Idezuki lying here bleeding from her head?

247
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,580
Yes.

248
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,780
The movie Ms. Idezuki was watching

249
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,780
is this video tape she was holding in her left hand.

250
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,080
The video deck she was using...

251
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,780
judging from the remote control she was holding in her right hand,

252
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,380
it is this deck.

253
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,680
"Sakura Sanjuro"

254
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,780
It's "Sakura Sanjuro"!

255
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,280
How nostalgic.

256
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,780
Inspector Megure, you know this story?

257
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,780
Yes, if I remember correctly, it started off something like

258
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,680
"The path you are to walk along is as beautiful as a flower."

259
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,880
"And you are to live..."

260
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,680
"As strong as the trunk of a tree!"

261
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,980
Right?

262
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,780
We heard the movie!

263
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,880
Because the lady was watching the movie full blast!

264
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,880
Why... why are you all here?

265
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,580
We came to help to search for something that was lost!

266
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:26,780
A hand-winding wristwatch that Mr. Morita's wife had misplaced

267
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,980
the day before she passed away!

268
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,080
Well, although Conan already found it in the bathroom.

269
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,080
Why did you ask the kids to help you look for something like that, though?

270
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,580
I asked Detective Mouri to help me search for it at first,

271
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,480
but was refused.

272
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,280
So, I had the children and Dr. Agasa who at the office to help me search.

273
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,080
I see. So Mr. Mouri's not here, then.

274
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,980
What? Did you want anything with him?

275
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,180
Nothing.

276
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,780
I just had something I wanted to confirm with Mr. Mouri.

277
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,280
"Sakura Sanjuro"

278
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,180
The tape has been rewound to the beginning.

279
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,080
It seems that she finished watching the movie

280
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,780
and when she took the tape out of the deck,

281
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,980
she was attacked from behind.

282
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,380
I don't mean to be rude, but where were you at that time?

283
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,680
I think I was in the bathroom.

284
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,680
He's telling the truth!

285
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,880
We heard vase crack right when Conan found the wristwatch

286
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,080
and Mr. Morita was with us in the bathroom!

287
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,880
After that, we heard the sound of someone running

288
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,980
and the front door is closing too.

289
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,880
The killer must've come from outside!

290
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,880
Which means that Mr. Morita was with you and the children right through?

291
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,880
No, he went into the kitchen to make some sandwiches part way.

292
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,280
The kitchen? Where's that?

293
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,680
It's way inside beyond this living room.

294
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,680
Over here.

295
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,380
Where were you then, Dr. Agasa?

296
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,080
I was in the living room here with the children.

297
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,780
If you open the door on the corridor side of this kitchen,

298
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,780
it is one straight line to the audio room where the corpse was found.

299
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,080
Yes.

300
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,380
Besides, it's a blind spot from the door of the living room.

301
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,080
It's possible to sneak out for a while in this situation.

302
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,880
What do you mean, Mr. Inspector?

303
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,280
In other words, the sound of the of the flower vase cracking,

304
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,280
the sound of footsteps and the sound of the front door closing...

305
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,080
If these were all sounds recorded beforehand by you,

306
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,480
you could've sneaked out of the kitchen

307
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,080
while pretending to make sandwiches,

308
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,080
and played the pre-recorded sounds

309
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,980
after beating Ms. Idezuki to death!

310
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,180
It's not strange that nobody heard her being beaten to death

311
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,680
if she was listening to the movie

312
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,880
with the volume turned up high.

313
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,280
No way.

314
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,780
But, that's not possible!

315
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:08,780
Well, you saw the tea and sandwich in the audio room, didn't you?

316
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:14,280
Ayumi and I brought those to Ms. Idezuki.

317
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,880
At that time, she was still watching the video.

318
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,080
And when we heard the flower vase crack

319
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,180
and found the corpse,

320
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,980
Mr. Morita was with us right through until then.

321
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,780
I see.

322
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,780
Inspector Megure!

323
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,380
I've finished asking around the people of the condo just now!

324
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,080
It seems that Ms. Idezuki

325
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,880
had been lending money to some other residents of this condo,

326
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,380
and if they couldn't pay her back on time,

327
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,080
she would take the valuables

328
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,380
that those people owned as interest!

329
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,680
Which means she didn't have that great of a reputation.

330
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,980
Besides, it seems that the people of the condo

331
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,780
knew that she was going to come here today!

332
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,080
What?

333
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,880
The sound of the movie.

334
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,880
It seems that she used to watch movies in this audio room

335
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,980
with the volume turned up full blast.

336
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,380
If they knew that she was going to be here,

337
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,480
it could be that the killer came from outside.

338
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,980
Okay, check everybody who had borrowed from Ms. Idezuki!

339
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,180
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

340
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,780
If it's a killer from outside,

341
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,780
I guess there won't be anything for you to do this time.

342
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,180
No, I think that the killer is Mr. Morita.

343
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,680
What? But you just mentioned a while ago

344
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,680
that it was impossible for him to commit the crime.

345
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,280
Don't you think something's fishy?

346
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,780
A hand-winding type wristwatch that was lost three weeks ago

347
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,680
was still moving accurately when we found it.

348
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,980
The longest a hand wound watch can keep on operating continuously

349
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,980
is at most 50 hours.

350
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,080
It could never go on ticking for three weeks if left as is!

351
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,380
Then don't tell me that the wristwatch is...

352
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,380
Yes. An excuse to get us to come here...

353
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,780
probably to set up an alibi.

354
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,380
But, it's for sure

355
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:15,480
that Mr. Morita didn't enters the audio room during the time of the crime.

356
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,980
I looked in on the kitchen in question every two to three minutes

357
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,680
but he was where he was supposed to be.

358
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,280
He hasn't made any suspicious moves

359
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,380
even after the corpse was found.

360
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,080
He could never had committed a crime like that.

361
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,580
By the way, Mr. Morita,

362
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,980
when you went to Mr. Mouri's office,

363
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,580
did you run into anyone suspicious in the vicinity?

364
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,380
No, not that I recall.

365
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,380
I see. Thank you.

366
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,580
Officer Takagi, what was that about?

367
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,780
Nothing.

368
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,980
Inspector and I are still considering

369
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,780
whether we should tell him in person.

370
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,780
It seems that

371
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:06,180
someone is secretly checking up on Mr. Mouri.

372
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,380
We found that the investigation records

373
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:14,480
that Mr. Mouri handled up within town were all disappeared

374
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,480
from the police department.

375
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:21,380
Since Officer Matsumoto had copies of the investigation records stored,

376
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,580
so it didn't cause any problems arose during the trial,

377
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,180
but surprisingly, all the investigation records

378
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,080
were sent back to the police department last night.

379
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,980
They were all in a sealed envelope with no return address on it.

380
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,980
And, when did the papers disappear?

381
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,880
I think it was...

382
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,480
the day when you and the others got messed up in a bus-jack.

383
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,480
We're investigating the case

384
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,180
as it may be a crime committed by a relative of the suspect

385
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,280
who is after Mr. Mouri's life out of hate for him.

386
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,280
But, we haven't been able to come up with anyone for a while,

387
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,580
so we're thinking if we should protect Mr. Mouri with bodyguards.

388
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,680
But then it could be a simple prank too.

389
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,480
At any rate, if you see anybody suspicious around Mr. Mouri,

390
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,780
make sure you call the police right away!

391
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,980
Okay, I got it!

392
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,980
No, the one they're after is not Pops,

393
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,480
but maybe...

394
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:29,280
And maybe they are...

395
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,820
Next Conan's hint:

396
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,360
"Sandwich"

397
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,380
-Next episode... -I got it!

398
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,720
Did pops get the right guy, or...

399
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,640
He got it.
