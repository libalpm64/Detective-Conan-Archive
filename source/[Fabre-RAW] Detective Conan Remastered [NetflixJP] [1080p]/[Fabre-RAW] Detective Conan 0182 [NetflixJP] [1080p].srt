1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,140
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,940
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,840
Deductions take all shapes and styles in each and every case to be solved.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,340
Today's stage is an ordinary condo.

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,140
The Youth Detective Squad solves the case with their wits!

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,040
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:03,190
"The Great Search-Nine Door"

10
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,090
I wish I could find something interesting to do.

11
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,190
The world is full of cases to be solved and yet...

12
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:14,590
It's strange that nothing's happening only around us, yeah.

13
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,490
Nothing's strange about it.

14
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,890
That's the way it should be.

15
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,090
What's that?

16
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,490
It's a ring.

17
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,590
I wonder where it came flying from.

18
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,290
There was nobody on this side.

19
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,590
I think somebody threw it from the window of this condo.

20
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,490
Huh?

21
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,390
All the windows are closed.

22
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,290
A prank?

23
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,490
Hey, watch it!

24
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,590
But,

25
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,290
I wonder why it's on something like this.

26
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,190
It's a 'S' shaped hook.

27
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,390
There's one here too.

28
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,490
Maybe that hook was also attached to the ring

29
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,190
but came off when it fell to the ground.

30
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,190
Huh?

31
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,590
Wait a minute.

32
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,890
What's up?

33
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,290
Hey, hey, don't tell me...

34
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,690
Look.

35
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,590
Doesn't this look like a word?

36
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,590
SOS?

37
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,590
Yes. This ring and 'S' shaped hooks

38
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,790
are an SOS sign that somebody is sending us.

39
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,690
I expected them to say that.

40
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,090
If so, it must be a woman.

41
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,090
Huh?

42
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,490
There is lipstick on the hook.

43
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,490
She's right. There's lipstick on it.

44
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,690
Hey, hey, you're getting carried away.

45
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,390
Mitsuhiko, will you show me the ring?

46
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,490
This is a wedding ring.

47
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,490
See, M to A.

48
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,690
1999 March 21 is carved on it.

49
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,490
This means that the ring was sent from somebody

50
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,690
with the initial M to someone with the initial A.

51
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,990
And that they were married on March 21, 1999.

52
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,190
Wow, it's amazing that you can tell, Ayumi.

53
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,290
My parents' ring has the same thing carved on it.

54
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,990
So this ring is one that the woman was wearing.

55
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:19,590
Her husband's initial is M and her initial is A.

56
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,990
Will you lend it to me?

57
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,390
The size of this ring is about 11.

58
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,190
Women regularly take sizes 7 to 9,

59
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,990
so this woman must have pretty fat fingers.

60
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,590
Listen, you guys.

61
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,090
There's no mistake about it.

62
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,890
The one who sent out an SOS...

63
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,490
is somewhere on the 1st to the 9th floor of this condo,

64
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,090
and is for some reason is rendered immobile.

65
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,890
Could it be an accident or...

66
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,590
Maybe she's locked up.

67
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,690
All the windows are closed.

68
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,990
Which means that

69
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,490
either she closed them right after she dropped the ring

70
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,790
because she sensed danger,

71
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,890
or the one confining her closed them, right?

72
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,090
We'll have to find that room in a hurry

73
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,490
because she may be in danger.

74
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,390
All right. The Youth Detective Squad to the scene on the double.

75
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,990
Let's go!

76
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,790
Hey.

77
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:23,090
Don't tell me you seriously think it's a kidnap case?

78
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,290
I wonder,

79
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,290
but it's a good way to pass the time, isn't it?

80
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,390
What's the matter?

81
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:42,690
The door is an auto lock door and it won't open.

82
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,290
Behind you.

83
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,490
Have a nice day.

84
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,990
So, we got in, but what now?

85
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,890
Let's check the initials of the couples

86
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,490
who live in the rooms facing the little window

87
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,790
that we just saw,

88
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,690
and the room numbers from the 1st to 9th floors.

89
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,790
But, how?

90
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,290
There doesn't seem to be a manager's room here either.

91
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:08,090
The road we came from is exactly west of this condo.

92
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,290
All we have to do is find a room in this condo

93
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,290
that faces exactly west.

94
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,690
This way.

95
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,290
He's pretty good, isn't he?

96
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,590
That's nothing to be amazed of.

97
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,790
The initial of his first name is 'T' for Tsutomu.

98
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,690
It's not this room.

99
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,090
All the rooms above this one should have a number 5 on them.

100
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,290
Let's split up and check the name plates.

101
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:47,390
Haibara and Ayumi, go check the odd number floors.

102
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,090
We'll go check the even number floors.

103
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,590
You can count on us.

104
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,190
Goju Kaze?

105
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,290
Unusual name.

106
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:05,290
It's not read like that. It read Igarashi.

107
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,490
Oh?

108
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,290
Shima.

109
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,890
We have no way of knowing with just the last name.

110
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,890
The initial of his first name is 'S'.

111
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,290
It's not this room.

112
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,390
No.

113
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:27,590
We did it. The names of the entire family are written.

114
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,490
Too bad, no good again.

115
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,490
Their initials are 'K' for Kosaku and 'N' for Natsue.

116
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,490
And all their initials were displayed.

117
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,790
'A' and 'M'.

118
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,490
We did it. Isn't this it?

119
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:54,290
Genta, we're looking for a husband with the initial 'M'

120
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,790
and a wife with the initial 'A'.

121
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,790
-This is the opposite. -I see.

122
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,890
Look, look.

123
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,890
The initial of the first name is 'M'.

124
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,690
We can't tell what the name of his wife is.

125
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,890
He may be living alone.

126
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,490
I suppose.

127
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,290
Five rooms may be a possibility.

128
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:24,190
Out of the five, four only had their last names listed outside.

129
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,790
Maybe their names may be written on the post box outside.

130
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,190
Oh, that's right.

131
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,790
Let's go check.

132
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,090
Good thinking, Ayumi.

133
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,990
Wait. Please stay here, Genta.

134
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,090
If we all go out, we won't be able to get back in.

135
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,790
Shucks, no fun.

136
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,190
Rooms 205 and 305

137
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,590
have only the last name listed, after all.

138
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,790
But, look. 805 and 905.

139
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,190
'Y' and 'E' so they aren't the ones.

140
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,390
So, we've only got three more to go.

141
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,390
Room 205 and 305.

142
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,790
I wonder if there's any way we can check the names?

143
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,090
There is a way.

144
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,890
Where are you going?

145
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,490
Hey, just where are you guys going?

146
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,390
Hey, don't leave me here alone!

147
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,390
Here it is. 4-11-10 Beika-cho.

148
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,990
It's the address of this condo.

149
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,290
The name is...

150
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,590
The initial's 'T', so he isn't the one.

151
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,490
Here it is.

152
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,290
The initial of his first name is 'M'.

153
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,590
All right.

154
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,290
So, the possibilities now

155
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,390
are Mr. Masakazu Shima of room 305

156
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:50,190
and Mr. Michihiro Ishida of room 705.

157
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,490
But, this is as far as we can check.

158
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,390
How about if we check the bicycles?

159
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,490
Oh, that's a good idea, Mitsuhiko.

160
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,290
Oh, shoots. What're they doing?

161
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,790
Hey.

162
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,890
Oh no, don't close.

163
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,690
What's up?

164
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,490
It seems that you've gotten interested.

165
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,190
They're so serious about it, so...

166
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:22,890
I found it!

167
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,390
Mr. Shima's bicycle.

168
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,590
See.

169
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,990
Asuka?

170
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,190
Initial is 'A'.

171
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,790
Then, the husband's initial is 'M'

172
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,790
and the wife's initial is 'A'?

173
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,790
Bingo. We've finally found them.

174
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:41,390
But, there's still Mr. Michihiro Ishida left.

175
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,490
If it's just one family, I guess we could ask the neighbors.

176
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,690
"Ishida"

177
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,490
I guess nobody's home.

178
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,390
If the neighbor's not in, let's go right down below.

179
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,490
All right.

180
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,290
This is the room where the initials 'A' and 'M'

181
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,290
belonged to the wrong person.

182
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,290
I made a mistake.

183
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,490
Hello.

184
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,290
What is it?

185
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,290
We're doing research on the

186
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,590
life of the Japanese people for our class.

187
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,090
What? I can't hear you very well!

188
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,990
And, we're checking on Japanese names in particular.

189
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,490
Do you happen to know the name of Mr. Ishida's wife,

190
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,490
who lives above you?

191
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,490
How would I know the name of the person who lives above me?

192
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,390
What a lady.

193
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,590
If right below is no good then...

194
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,690
Let's go right above, right?

195
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,990
Mr. Ishida's wife's name?

196
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,790
I'm sure it was Fumiko.

197
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,890
F-U-M-I-K-O.

198
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,290
Once before a postal delivery for her

199
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,390
was mistakenly delivered here.

200
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,990
Fumiko, which means...

201
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,890
The initial of her name is 'F'.

202
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:02,590
Her child is called Yuta and he's a smart kid.

203
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,490
He got locked up in the closet once before

204
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,390
and couldn't come out.

205
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,690
Huh? A closet, you mean the room to the extreme west?

206
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,990
Right.

207
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,690
What do you think he did back then?

208
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,990
He dropped and hung toilet paper out of the window of the restroom,

209
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,690
and let the people who were walking below know.

210
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,290
Miss.

211
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:26,490
Do all the people who live in this condo know that story?

212
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,890
Yes, I'm sure they do.

213
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,390
It's a well known story within this condo so...

214
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,690
Oh my God. It's been done before.

215
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,690
Conan.

216
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,690
What on earth is the matter?

217
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,390
We're going to the 3rd floor.

218
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,290
Because the only ones with the initials 'M' and 'A'

219
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,790
are Masakazu Shima and his wife Asuka of room 305.

220
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:53,690
What's going on? You're suddenly so interested.

221
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,890
He starting to think that there something going on

222
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,290
after talking to the lady.

223
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,470
What?

224
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,770
Hide.

225
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,670
They're thieves.

226
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,370
They're wearing gloves.

227
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,370
Sunglasses too.

228
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,770
You don't even finish the job right.

229
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,770
Why'd you kill for?

230
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,170
Shut up.

231
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,770
Kill?

232
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,470
Darn, we're too late.

233
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,770
What shall we do, Conan?

234
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,570
Let's call the police.

235
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,070
Hurry!

236
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:19,170
We've got to get outside before they get on the elevator!

237
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,670
That was a close one.

238
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,370
Police officers.

239
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,770
Let's tell them!

240
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:46,570
Big trouble! It's armed robbery and murder!

241
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,370
In that condo over there!

242
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,170
You'd better hurry or the criminals'll get away!

243
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,270
Please hurry!

244
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,870
Hold it! You're not getting away!

245
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,970
What is it?

246
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,870
It's them.

247
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,370
They killed a woman.

248
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,470
They may be armed with a gun.

249
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,570
What?

250
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,070
What's with you guys?

251
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,770
What on earth is this about?

252
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,070
Freeze.

253
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,170
You kids go outside.

254
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,470
Please check inside room 305.

255
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,970
The dead body of Asuka Shima should be there.

256
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,270
Dead body?

257
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,770
What are you talking about? There's no such dead body!

258
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,170
Don't lie.

259
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,970
Then why did you say, "Why did you kill?" Just a while ago?

260
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,970
We all heard you, right?

261
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,170
Yep.

262
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,170
Come on.

263
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,370
That's about an insect.

264
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,670
An insect?

265
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:47,070
I was angry because he carelessly killed my insect.

266
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,370
And, besides, I'm Asuka Shima.

267
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:55,870
See, my driver's license.

268
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,270
Ghads, talk about being a nuisance.

269
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,070
There was no dead body anywhere.

270
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,870
Besides, we checked with the neighbors

271
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,770
and they verified that those two were Mr. and Mrs. Shima too.

272
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,370
All of you, apologize to them.

273
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,770
Yes, sir.

274
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,770
We're really very sorry.

275
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,970
No problem.

276
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:24,770
We confused you with the subject we were talking about too.

277
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:29,170
But, officer, it's true that someone is being locked up.

278
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,070
No, that's enough.

279
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,470
Don't you ever do something like this again.

280
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,070
Yes, sir.

281
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:43,970
They were married.

282
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,670
We completely mistook them to be armed robbers and murderers.

283
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,370
There is no other room

284
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,770
where the occupants initials are 'M' or 'A', is there...

285
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:55,570
Maybe these aren't initials.

286
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,170
Something bothers me.

287
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,570
I wonder what it is.

288
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:03,870
Maybe the person's name in room 705 is read Ayako

289
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,570
and not Fumiko?

290
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,770
Right. If it's read 'Ayako', the initial would be 'A'.

291
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,470
We're lucky to buy the meat so cheap,

292
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,070
weren't we, Fumiko?

293
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,470
We sure were, mother.

294
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,870
So, it's read Fumiko, after all.

295
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,770
So, they're safe.

296
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,870
Hurry up, Yuta.

297
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:36,070
He's the Toilet Paper boy, isn't he?

298
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,170
Hurry up, Yuta.

299
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,670
What a skinny mother.

300
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,870
My mom is so over-weight

301
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,670
that she's wearing dad's tee-shirts.

302
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,670
Over-weight?

303
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,970
Ayumi, let me see the ring.

304
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,070
Here you go.

305
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,570
Conan?

306
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,170
What's with him?

307
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:13,470
Hey, Conan? What's up?

308
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,270
Open up! What're you saying, Conan?

309
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,770
He's gone.

310
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,770
"Akihiko Uehara, Misato Uehara"

311
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,670
You again? What now?

312
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,770
Hey. What's with you, anyway?

313
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,270
This is what was bothering me after all.

314
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,970
Hey, get out of here, will you?

315
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,370
Are you Mr. Akihiko Uehara's wife?

316
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,970
Is your name Misato?

317
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,270
Huh? Yes.

318
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,670
This is yours then, isn't it?

319
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,170
I picked it up in front of the door a while ago.

320
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:04,370
The initials 'A' for Akihiko and 'M',

321
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,670
for the initial of your fist name is carved on it.

322
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,970
Try it on.

323
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:20,270
Take a good look at the ring, lady.

324
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:23,570
The initials 'M' to 'A' are carved on it.

325
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:29,270
From 'M' to 'A'. From Misato to Akihiko.

326
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:33,870
Yeah, that's actually Akihiko's ring.

327
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,370
But, Misato was wearing it.

328
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:39,070
That's why it was hard to tell.

329
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,870
According to the neighbors they say that

330
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:44,470
Misato has recently gained weight.

331
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,070
Not being able to wear her own ring,

332
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,970
she probably wore Akihiko's ring instead.

333
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,270
Because many Japanese men don't wear rings

334
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,270
even after getting married.

335
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,870
And besides, I think that Akihiko

336
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:59,170
has slender fingers for a man.

337
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,270
What are you getting at?

338
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:09,270
Aren't those shoes a little too small for you to wear?

339
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,370
Is that all you wanted to say?

340
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,470
What I want to say is that

341
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,370
you're not Misato, an impostor.

342
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,270
Huh?

343
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,270
So...

344
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,270
What if I am?

345
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,870
That was real close.

346
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,970
Mrs. Misato Uehara?

347
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,870
Yes, who are you, sonny?

348
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:02,570
Me? I'm Conan Edogawa, a detective.

349
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,070
The criminal Ikuyo Hasegawa

350
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:38,270
used to be Misato Uehara's husband's ex-colleague

351
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,870
and, since Akihiko had found that

352
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,570
she had embezzled money from the company,

353
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,670
she was fired from the company.

354
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,870
She had committed the crime out of hatred for him.

355
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:49,370
Ikuyo had visited the condo in order to kill Akihiko.

356
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:52,070
When Misato answers the door, Ikuyo put her to sleep using a drug,

357
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,870
and locked her up in the closet.

358
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,870
Misato, who came to a while later

359
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,370
connects the ring to the 'S' hook

360
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,970
and throws it out of the window in hopes of getting help.

361
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:06,570
But, right after that,

362
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,770
Ikuyo who comes to check on her closes the window,

363
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:13,370
and was put to sleep again with the drug.

364
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,770
Wow, you really did a good job, sonny.

365
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,970
Take care on your way home.

366
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,170
Yes, sir.

367
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,970
No fair, Conan.

368
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,770
Really, taking all the good part for yourself.

369
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,870
Yeah, you get me so mad.

370
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,870
You hold all this as punishment.

371
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,770
What? Am I supposed to hold all this?

372
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,070
Of course.

373
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,270
Hey, wait.

374
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,270
Thanks for holding mine too.

375
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:50,470
Hey, hey, not you too.

376
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:00,670
It's my turn to send out an SOS signal.

377
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,340
Next Conan's Hint:

378
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,140
"Shiritori"

379
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,440
The Youth Detective Squad does a good job in the next episode too.

380
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,400
We'll take on any case.

381
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:11,460
Why am I always left out?
We'll take on any case.

382
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,640
Why am I always left out?
