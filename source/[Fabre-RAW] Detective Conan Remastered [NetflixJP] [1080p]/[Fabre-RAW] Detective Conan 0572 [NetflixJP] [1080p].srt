1
00:00:02,517 --> 00:00:04,117
The haunted storeroom.

2
00:00:04,117 --> 00:00:07,617
We, the detective squad set off to check on a rumour

3
00:00:07,617 --> 00:00:11,817
saying that everything that is placed storeroom disappears in an instant.

4
00:00:11,817 --> 00:00:15,517
Why are Genta and the others so excited about this case?

5
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:18,617
After checking the inside of the storeroom,

6
00:00:18,617 --> 00:00:21,217
we find traces of footprints left here and there on the floor.

7
00:00:21,217 --> 00:00:24,617
We also find a large abacus embedded in the wall beyond,

8
00:00:24,617 --> 00:00:27,717
but there is nothing else there. The storeroom is completely empty.

9
00:00:29,417 --> 00:00:33,217
But, when you look in through the window,

10
00:00:33,217 --> 00:00:36,617
there is a heap of treasure that covers the entire floor.

11
00:00:36,617 --> 00:00:40,817
It can't be! It was empty just a while ago!

12
00:00:40,817 --> 00:00:43,717
However, when the door is opened again,

13
00:00:43,717 --> 00:00:46,317
the treasure that was there is gone,

14
00:00:46,317 --> 00:00:48,917
and the storeroom is empty as before.

15
00:00:48,917 --> 00:00:51,417
I figured that either the ceiling or floor moved,

16
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:54,117
thereby making the treasure appear and disappear.

17
00:00:54,117 --> 00:00:55,917
But that possibility was denied after looking at the pictures

18
00:00:55,917 --> 00:00:57,817
taken by Mitsuhiko and the others

19
00:00:57,817 --> 00:01:00,717
and the mark that was put on the floor.

20
00:01:00,717 --> 00:01:03,617
Regardless, I'm sure there's something.

21
00:01:03,617 --> 00:01:05,817
Something like magic,

22
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:08,517
in which the treasure can be put in and out.

23
00:01:11,317 --> 00:01:13,217
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

24
00:01:13,217 --> 00:01:15,417
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

25
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:17,217
The Detective Squad is really on their toes.

26
00:01:17,217 --> 00:01:19,417
They solve the mystery of the rigged mansion.

27
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:21,217
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:21,217 --> 00:01:23,217
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:25,317
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

30
00:03:06,321 --> 00:03:12,021
"Treasure Battle in the Haunted Storeroom (Part 2)"

31
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:15,321
First, the thing that stands out is,

32
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:18,021
that queer Shinto altar that is set up

33
00:03:18,021 --> 00:03:20,221
right above the entrance of the door.

34
00:03:20,221 --> 00:03:22,821
Setting something right above a inward opening door

35
00:03:22,821 --> 00:03:24,221
is dangerous, isn't it?

36
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:25,821
If someone happens to come in

37
00:03:25,821 --> 00:03:27,821
when you're making an offering to the altar.

38
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:29,721
That's true.

39
00:03:29,721 --> 00:03:32,321
And the thing that bothers me

40
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:34,421
even more than that altar is...

41
00:03:35,421 --> 00:03:37,721
that abacus that's embedded in the wall

42
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:39,121
right opposite the Shinto altar.

43
00:03:39,121 --> 00:03:42,421
I wonder what it is?

44
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:45,621
Maybe it's there to count the number of treasure that is brought here.

45
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:48,421
If so, it should be lying sideways.

46
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:50,621
If placing it vertically, no matter how much you calculate

47
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:52,321
and move the balls on the abacus,

48
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:53,921
they'll just all come falling down.

49
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:57,521
No, there's a stick sticking out from behind the balls

50
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:00,121
and it's set into the space behind.

51
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:02,621
Genta, lend me your back!

52
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:04,021
Okay!

53
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:09,221
It's most likely that if you move one of the balls...

54
00:04:12,421 --> 00:04:15,821
Did you hear that sound?

55
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:19,221
Conan, try moving more!

56
00:04:19,221 --> 00:04:21,421
Yeah.

57
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:25,321
I'll move the ball that is right below the one I just moved, up.

58
00:04:26,821 --> 00:04:28,821
It fell down.

59
00:04:28,821 --> 00:04:32,821
It seems that the abacus is working as a switch for something,

60
00:04:32,821 --> 00:04:35,921
and if the wrong ball is moved, it resets.

61
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:41,921
Judging from the amount of dust that is accumulated on the ball,

62
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:44,321
only the balls of the upper second level to the extreme right edge

63
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:47,221
seem to have been moved,

64
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:48,721
As for the five rows below,

65
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,121
only the balls of the 3rd row from the right

66
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:52,121
and the balls in the 6th row

67
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:55,021
and the 4th row with no balls

68
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:58,121
and the 8th row where the balls are all clumped together

69
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:00,021
show traces of having been moved.

70
00:05:00,021 --> 00:05:04,021
The 3rd row from the right...

71
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:05,321
And what row was it?

72
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:08,121
4th, 6th and 8th rows!

73
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:11,021
Huh? Are you keying in mail?

74
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:14,721
I'm taking notes, so I don't forget.

75
00:05:14,721 --> 00:05:18,221
Okay, I'll go look through that window once more,

76
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:19,721
so wait for me inside!

77
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:21,121
Okay.

78
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:25,921
Hey, you haven't finished checking the storeroom yet?

79
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:27,821
No.

80
00:05:29,221 --> 00:05:31,821
There's a strange slit in the door.

81
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:34,221
Besides, theses stairs...

82
00:05:34,221 --> 00:05:37,121
Hey, hurry up and go look!

83
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:40,421
"Investigations should be done speedily" is basic!

84
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:41,921
Okay.

85
00:05:43,221 --> 00:05:46,121
Darn! Is it Ms. Kobayashi...

86
00:05:47,121 --> 00:05:50,321
the one who is giving them ideas?

87
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:53,721
Huh? You said I call the children?

88
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:55,521
I don't have such time.

89
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,721
I'm in the middle of a teacher's meeting, you know.

90
00:05:57,721 --> 00:06:00,321
Rather, you're at the storeroom in question, aren't you?

91
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:03,921
Tell me where it is? I'll go on over later!

92
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:05,721
So, she isn't the one.

93
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:08,321
Which means...

94
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:11,421
Yeah, I did get a phone call from Ai.

95
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,021
Hey, quit playing dumb with me!

96
00:06:13,021 --> 00:06:15,221
You called Mitsuhiko and the others, didn't you?

97
00:06:15,221 --> 00:06:19,221
No, I didn't! Since Ai said she's going to be late today,

98
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:23,021
I'm making beef stew that takes time to make, you see!

99
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:27,021
Beef stew? I didn't know you could cook something like that, Doc.

100
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:29,421
The onions are starting to look good, Doc!

101
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:31,121
Oh, I see!

102
00:06:31,121 --> 00:06:34,121
Hey, is Subaru there, too?

103
00:06:34,121 --> 00:06:38,221
Yeah, I had him come over to make it while Ai's away!

104
00:06:38,221 --> 00:06:42,121
He's a pretty good cook, you see!

105
00:06:42,121 --> 00:06:46,221
Subaru's not text mailing while pan frying the onions, is he?

106
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:47,721
Of course not!

107
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:50,621
We can't take our eyes off the pan, because it'll get burnt if we do.

108
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:55,321
Then, who in the world is it that's giving them clues?

109
00:06:56,321 --> 00:06:58,021
Oh, my God.

110
00:06:58,021 --> 00:07:00,921
Is Conan Edogawa on the phone?

111
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,921
Yeah, it seems that he's gone with the children

112
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:07,021
to check up on a haunted storeroom.

113
00:07:07,021 --> 00:07:08,621
A haunted storeroom?

114
00:07:08,621 --> 00:07:11,521
According to the call I received from Ai a while ago,

115
00:07:11,521 --> 00:07:14,921
it's a strange storeroom in which the things that are put inside it

116
00:07:14,921 --> 00:07:17,921
disappear in no time at all.

117
00:07:17,921 --> 00:07:20,921
That sure sounds interesting.

118
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:25,121
Conan!

119
00:07:27,821 --> 00:07:31,521
How are things inside the storeroom as compared to a while ago?

120
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:33,921
Not any different.

121
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:37,821
The only difference is whether the treasure is there or not.

122
00:07:40,021 --> 00:07:43,321
It seems that the floor is a bit farther than before.

123
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:45,321
Far?

124
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:49,621
It can't be, because the storeroom couldn't possibly be growing.

125
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:53,921
Maybe it ate up the treasure that Conan saw a while ago,

126
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:56,221
so the storeroom got big.

127
00:07:56,221 --> 00:07:57,221
That can't be.

128
00:07:57,221 --> 00:07:59,121
But...

129
00:08:00,421 --> 00:08:01,721
Something fell!

130
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:04,821
It seems to have been by the wall.

131
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:09,221
The detective squad badge!

132
00:08:10,421 --> 00:08:12,621
It's Mitsuhiko's badge!

133
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:16,021
Where in the world did it come from?

134
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:20,221
It's here after all. Something's here after all!

135
00:08:20,221 --> 00:08:22,621
There's a monster in the ceiling!

136
00:08:22,621 --> 00:08:27,521
It picked up Mitsuhiko's badge, and threw it just now!

137
00:08:27,521 --> 00:08:29,121
No way!

138
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:32,921
A monster in the ceiling? That can't be.

139
00:08:38,021 --> 00:08:39,721
Could... could it be...

140
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:45,921
Uh, let's get out of this storeroom already.

141
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:48,621
Yeah, it's creepy.

142
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:50,521
But...

143
00:08:52,721 --> 00:08:54,221
Telephone.

144
00:08:54,221 --> 00:08:55,621
Maybe...

145
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:56,721
"I figured it out!"

146
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:01,721
Hey, it's about time you come out of the storeroom

147
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:03,121
or the sun will set soon!

148
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:05,221
Mister.

149
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:07,621
You said that this storeroom was built

150
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:09,721
around the end of the Tokugawa shogunate regimne, right?

151
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:11,421
Yeah.

152
00:09:11,421 --> 00:09:13,721
Could the person who built it

153
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:16,121
have been Kichiemon Samizu, a puppeteer?

154
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:17,821
That's right.

155
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:20,621
Then, I think you should make a call.

156
00:09:23,621 --> 00:09:27,521
Call the police officer from Investigations 3rd division.

157
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:35,821
Oh, it's you people who called us, the police.

158
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:38,221
We haven't seen you since the Girl's Day Festival doll case,

159
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:39,521
have we, Inspector Momose?

160
00:09:39,521 --> 00:09:41,721
And, is it true that

161
00:09:41,721 --> 00:09:45,221
you maybe have found the culprit who's on the run?

162
00:09:45,221 --> 00:09:46,621
Yep, the fact is...

163
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:48,521
A thief!

164
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,921
The culprit who's been going around

165
00:09:50,921 --> 00:09:54,221
breaking in to the jewelry and antique shops in this vicinity!

166
00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:57,521
That guy is here. Inside this storeroom!

167
00:09:57,521 --> 00:10:01,221
He's accumulated a lot of treasure here!

168
00:10:03,021 --> 00:10:05,421
Inside this storeroom...

169
00:10:05,421 --> 00:10:07,521
But, there's not one person here,

170
00:10:07,521 --> 00:10:10,121
much less no sign of treasure at all.

171
00:10:10,121 --> 00:10:11,821
This storeroom is rigged,

172
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:13,821
rigged to hide the treasure!

173
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:14,921
Rigged?

174
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:16,721
First, take note of this stairs

175
00:10:16,721 --> 00:10:19,421
by the entrance!

176
00:10:19,421 --> 00:10:21,321
It has four steps, correct?

177
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:22,321
Yeah...

178
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:27,621
But the stairs inside has five steps.

179
00:10:27,621 --> 00:10:29,221
True...

180
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:32,921
Besides, don't you think that

181
00:10:32,921 --> 00:10:34,821
every step on this side

182
00:10:34,821 --> 00:10:37,921
is much higher than those at the entrance?

183
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:40,621
Now that you mentioned it.

184
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:44,921
I see. That's why when you first came inside this storeroom...

185
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:48,921
Be careful! Watch your step because it's dark.

186
00:10:50,421 --> 00:10:52,321
You tripped.

187
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:55,121
Yeah, because I thought there were four steps

188
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,921
like the one at the entrance.

189
00:10:56,921 --> 00:10:59,921
But, so what?

190
00:10:59,921 --> 00:11:01,721
Can't you tell?

191
00:11:01,721 --> 00:11:03,621
Compared to the stairs outside,

192
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,321
there are more number of steps

193
00:11:05,321 --> 00:11:08,021
and moreover, if the steps are higher,

194
00:11:08,021 --> 00:11:11,421
it means, the inside is much deeper than is the ground.

195
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,621
It's only deeper.

196
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:14,821
There's no place a person can hide

197
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:17,221
or any place treasure can be hidden, is there?

198
00:11:17,221 --> 00:11:21,521
Don't tell me that the floor opens up or something.

199
00:11:21,521 --> 00:11:23,221
What's this?

200
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:28,121
It's the badge that we marked when we first came in here.

201
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:31,121
Back then, the storeroom was empty

202
00:11:31,121 --> 00:11:35,521
but we left once and Conan looked inside again

203
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:38,821
there was a lot of treasure inside!

204
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:43,821
But, that window is about 2 meters from the ceiling.

205
00:11:43,821 --> 00:11:46,021
The window that I looked at from outside a while ago,

206
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:48,321
is about 2 meters from the roof.

207
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:50,921
There seems to be nothing by the ceiling either.

208
00:11:50,921 --> 00:11:54,921
Your badges don't seem to have moved either,

209
00:11:54,921 --> 00:11:56,721
which means, there are no tricks on the floor.

210
00:11:56,721 --> 00:12:00,021
To make it look that way, is where the trick of this storeroom is!

211
00:12:00,021 --> 00:12:01,221
Trick?

212
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,221
Genta, are you ready?

213
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:05,721
Okay, I'll open it now!

214
00:12:06,921 --> 00:12:09,821
What?

215
00:12:17,254 --> 00:12:20,454
There's... there's a window on top of a window?

216
00:12:20,454 --> 00:12:24,454
Hey! Are you really opening the window that's on the outside?

217
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:27,154
Yeah! I climbed the tree and opened it!

218
00:12:27,154 --> 00:12:29,054
But, isn't it strange?

219
00:12:29,054 --> 00:12:30,254
Just a while ago

220
00:12:30,254 --> 00:12:32,854
the light seeped in from the space between the window below.

221
00:12:32,854 --> 00:12:36,454
Huh? No light is seeping in now.

222
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:37,854
That's probably because

223
00:12:37,854 --> 00:12:40,954
the a portion of the wooden board under the window is cut

224
00:12:40,954 --> 00:12:43,754
in order to let light into the storeroom.

225
00:12:43,754 --> 00:12:47,154
Then, a window matching the cut wood is also attached on the inside

226
00:12:47,154 --> 00:12:50,254
made to look like a real window.

227
00:12:50,254 --> 00:12:52,654
No light is seeping in right now because

228
00:12:52,654 --> 00:12:54,054
when the window was opened,

229
00:12:54,054 --> 00:12:57,054
something inside the wall like the wooden board slid

230
00:12:57,054 --> 00:13:00,854
and it's rigged so that the space in the wall is blocked!

231
00:13:00,854 --> 00:13:05,554
But if just like now, light is shone on it and the window is opened,

232
00:13:05,554 --> 00:13:07,354
anybody could see through the trick.

233
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:11,654
It's true that if this storeroom was built in modern times,

234
00:13:11,654 --> 00:13:13,854
it's an old-fashioned trick.

235
00:13:13,854 --> 00:13:16,354
But it was built at the end of the Tokugawa shogunate regime

236
00:13:16,354 --> 00:13:18,754
when there was no flashlight

237
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:21,654
that could conveniently shine light at a distance,

238
00:13:21,654 --> 00:13:24,354
don't you think this is a quite high leveled trick?

239
00:13:24,354 --> 00:13:27,954
Above the entrance where the ceiling is,

240
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:29,854
it is hidden out of view.

241
00:13:29,854 --> 00:13:31,254
Hidden out of view?

242
00:13:31,254 --> 00:13:32,954
That Shinto altar!

243
00:13:32,954 --> 00:13:34,754
It's attached right above the entrance

244
00:13:34,754 --> 00:13:37,654
so that you can't look up at the ceiling.

245
00:13:37,654 --> 00:13:40,054
If before entering, the person realizes

246
00:13:40,054 --> 00:13:42,954
that compared to the height of the roof,

247
00:13:42,954 --> 00:13:45,954
the ceiling after entering is obviously lower,

248
00:13:45,954 --> 00:13:48,654
the trick would lose it's meaning.

249
00:13:48,654 --> 00:13:52,154
Which means that the floor is constructed deeper than the ground,

250
00:13:52,154 --> 00:13:55,054
to give off the illusion that the ceiling is not low.

251
00:13:55,054 --> 00:13:57,254
Right! In other words,

252
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:59,754
this storeroom looks completely empty

253
00:13:59,754 --> 00:14:02,854
but in fact, a mysterious space

254
00:14:02,854 --> 00:14:05,654
exists in the ceiling!

255
00:14:05,654 --> 00:14:08,854
True, it would turn out that way but...

256
00:14:08,854 --> 00:14:11,554
How do you get up to the attic?

257
00:14:11,554 --> 00:14:14,254
You don't climb up!

258
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:17,154
We mentioned that when we first came here,

259
00:14:17,154 --> 00:14:20,054
we placed marked badges on the floor, didn't we?

260
00:14:20,054 --> 00:14:21,954
When we came in here,

261
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:25,654
Ayumi and Genta's badges were not moved

262
00:14:25,654 --> 00:14:29,554
but my badge alone that I left standing against the wall was gone.

263
00:14:29,554 --> 00:14:30,854
Gone?

264
00:14:30,854 --> 00:14:34,454
Yep! A little while later it came falling from above!

265
00:14:34,454 --> 00:14:36,954
It's most likely that right above the badge that I left standing

266
00:14:36,954 --> 00:14:39,654
poked into the wooden board of the ceiling,

267
00:14:39,654 --> 00:14:41,854
hung suspended in the air for a while,

268
00:14:41,854 --> 00:14:44,254
then naturally fell off.

269
00:14:45,354 --> 00:14:48,654
If the badge poked into the wooden board of the ceiling...

270
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:49,754
Don't tell me that...

271
00:14:49,754 --> 00:14:53,654
Yes, when Conan looked through the window,

272
00:14:53,654 --> 00:14:57,354
and we consider the fact that then...

273
00:14:58,454 --> 00:15:00,554
the floor was filled with treasure.

274
00:15:00,554 --> 00:15:02,854
There's no doubt that the ceiling moves up and down!

275
00:15:02,854 --> 00:15:04,054
I see.

276
00:15:04,054 --> 00:15:06,454
If the storeroom was rigged to move during an age

277
00:15:06,454 --> 00:15:09,754
when remote controllers didn't exist to move things from a distance,

278
00:15:09,754 --> 00:15:11,854
someone had to be here!

279
00:15:11,854 --> 00:15:14,454
However, if there is no sight of such a person around,

280
00:15:14,454 --> 00:15:16,554
nor any trace of anyone having left the storeroom,

281
00:15:16,554 --> 00:15:17,654
then the only conclusion is

282
00:15:17,654 --> 00:15:20,454
that the person must still be in the attic.

283
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:23,154
Yeah! And that guy's somebody who has to hide

284
00:15:23,154 --> 00:15:25,154
in the attic of a place like this.

285
00:15:25,154 --> 00:15:27,154
And he's surrounded by treasure...

286
00:15:27,154 --> 00:15:29,254
It's very likely that he's the thief

287
00:15:29,254 --> 00:15:32,854
who's been breaking into places recently!

288
00:15:33,954 --> 00:15:36,554
What do you think? Are we correct, Conan?

289
00:15:36,554 --> 00:15:41,254
Yeah, exactly! You guys are super.

290
00:15:41,254 --> 00:15:43,254
We did it...

291
00:15:43,254 --> 00:15:47,254
Then, have you figured out how to move the ceiling, too?

292
00:15:47,254 --> 00:15:50,154
That's probably done moving the balls on that abacus.

293
00:15:50,154 --> 00:15:52,054
Move the balls, how?

294
00:15:52,054 --> 00:15:56,154
Well, that's...

295
00:15:57,454 --> 00:16:00,754
I've got to look at it with my own eyes to figure it out.

296
00:16:00,754 --> 00:16:02,454
What?

297
00:16:06,154 --> 00:16:09,654
I see... You have to look at it with your own eyes to figure it out.

298
00:16:09,654 --> 00:16:11,754
Oh, well...

299
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:15,054
Inspector, the police officer you brought along is here, isn't he?

300
00:16:16,054 --> 00:16:17,154
Yes.

301
00:16:17,154 --> 00:16:20,754
Then, can you make him outside the storeroom.

302
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:23,054
Genta, keep your head inside the window!

303
00:16:23,054 --> 00:16:24,754
Okay.

304
00:16:24,754 --> 00:16:27,854
Ayumi, Mitsuhiko and Ai go out the storeroom

305
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:31,154
and hide behind the police officer that will be coming!

306
00:16:31,154 --> 00:16:33,354
Okay.

307
00:16:33,354 --> 00:16:36,554
I called two officers.

308
00:16:36,554 --> 00:16:39,754
Then, all that needs to be done now is to lower the ceiling

309
00:16:39,754 --> 00:16:42,254
by moving the balls of this abacus.

310
00:16:42,254 --> 00:16:44,954
But, which balls and how do you move them.

311
00:16:44,954 --> 00:16:46,654
The place that draws attention most

312
00:16:46,654 --> 00:16:49,554
is the row right in the middle where the balls are clumped together.

313
00:16:49,554 --> 00:16:52,354
Although they look as if they can't moved, they aren't movable,

314
00:16:52,354 --> 00:16:53,854
we need to divide it right in the middle

315
00:16:53,854 --> 00:16:57,554
and indicate something to the right and left, right?

316
00:16:57,554 --> 00:16:59,154
Something like what?

317
00:16:59,154 --> 00:17:02,254
Something like hiragana, katakana.

318
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:05,054
Or kanji characters.

319
00:17:05,054 --> 00:17:06,854
Kanji characters?

320
00:17:06,854 --> 00:17:08,254
You can figure out the character

321
00:17:08,254 --> 00:17:10,254
to the left side of the abacus, can't you?

322
00:17:10,254 --> 00:17:13,854
Raise the ball that is at the very bottom from the first seven row

323
00:17:13,854 --> 00:17:16,754
from left just one space up.

324
00:17:23,354 --> 00:17:24,754
That's right.

325
00:17:24,754 --> 00:17:28,054
Then move the ball in the 3rd, 4th and 5th rows

326
00:17:28,054 --> 00:17:32,054
that is 3rd from the bottom up.

327
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:40,254
The place with no balls look to be the kanji character "3".

328
00:17:40,254 --> 00:17:42,054
Then, the right side.

329
00:17:42,054 --> 00:17:45,254
Since there is a row with no balls whatsoever,

330
00:17:45,254 --> 00:17:48,354
it stands for a kanji character with a vertical line in the middle.

331
00:17:48,354 --> 00:17:50,054
Taking that into consideration

332
00:17:50,054 --> 00:17:53,554
and move each ball one up.

333
00:17:53,554 --> 00:17:57,454
The 2nd ball from the row to the extreme right

334
00:17:57,454 --> 00:18:01,154
and 3rd ball from the bottom of the 2nd row,

335
00:18:01,154 --> 00:18:05,154
Move the ball at the very bottom in the 5th row from the right.

336
00:18:05,154 --> 00:18:08,854
Then move the ball 2nd from the bottom in the 7th row from the right.

337
00:18:10,154 --> 00:18:14,654
This is the character to the right is...

338
00:18:14,654 --> 00:18:16,854
water (Mizu)?

339
00:18:18,154 --> 00:18:20,454
Three (san) and water (mizu).

340
00:18:20,454 --> 00:18:22,854
It's Kichiemon Samizu!

341
00:18:26,454 --> 00:18:28,754
Kichiemon Samizu?

342
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:32,454
The puppeteer who was famous in the last days of the Tokugawa regime.

343
00:18:32,454 --> 00:18:35,654
But, nothing moved!

344
00:18:35,654 --> 00:18:38,954
Because the character hasn't been completed yet.

345
00:18:38,954 --> 00:18:42,554
Try raising the ball in the top row at the right edge up!

346
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,654
Because the only ball that show traces of having been moved

347
00:18:44,654 --> 00:18:46,754
in the top row is that.

348
00:18:47,754 --> 00:18:51,254
Now the character has been completed,

349
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:01,854
The... the ceiling

350
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:03,854
is gradually closing in.

351
00:19:10,754 --> 00:19:12,654
What's going on?

352
00:19:12,654 --> 00:19:14,654
Conan.

353
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,554
Don't worry! It's built so that a space is made

354
00:19:18,554 --> 00:19:21,554
in keeping with the angle of the roof.

355
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:27,754
Then, would you like to see the heap of treasure?

356
00:19:34,754 --> 00:19:36,354
These are...

357
00:19:36,354 --> 00:19:40,554
They're all items that were reported stolen!

358
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,954
Just as would be expected of the great Kichiemon Samizu,

359
00:19:42,954 --> 00:19:46,754
a great trick indeed.

360
00:19:46,754 --> 00:19:49,454
They are items I've never seen before too.

361
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:52,254
Maybe they're things that were in this storeroom to begin with?

362
00:19:52,254 --> 00:19:53,954
I think they are valuables

363
00:19:53,954 --> 00:19:56,554
that the owner who had asked Samizu

364
00:19:56,554 --> 00:19:59,754
to make this storeroom hid here.

365
00:19:59,754 --> 00:20:02,754
And the one who took advantage of this rigged storeroom

366
00:20:02,754 --> 00:20:06,954
and hid the things that he stole inside and accumulated them is...

367
00:20:08,654 --> 00:20:11,354
this thief over here.

368
00:20:11,354 --> 00:20:12,854
I see.

369
00:20:12,854 --> 00:20:14,954
After the children left this storeroom,

370
00:20:14,954 --> 00:20:17,654
he tried to lower the ceiling and get out of here

371
00:20:17,654 --> 00:20:20,054
but since you looked inside from the window,

372
00:20:20,054 --> 00:20:22,554
he hastily moved the ceiling again

373
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,754
and returned it to the original position.

374
00:20:27,154 --> 00:20:31,254
Seriously, this sure is some illusionary trick device.

375
00:20:31,254 --> 00:20:35,554
Hey, sonny, be careful. He may have accomplices here with him.

376
00:20:35,554 --> 00:20:40,454
There aren't any. Because there was only one type of footprints.

377
00:20:40,454 --> 00:20:43,954
But, how do you plan to get out of here?

378
00:20:43,954 --> 00:20:48,354
Because the ceiling was lowered, the door is half blocked.

379
00:20:48,354 --> 00:20:51,654
See, between the floor that came down

380
00:20:51,654 --> 00:20:55,054
and the door there is a stream of light, isn't there?

381
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:59,054
If you touch a place on the door...

382
00:21:02,654 --> 00:21:03,954
Conan!

383
00:21:04,954 --> 00:21:07,654
You're the gardener that was hired to work here before!

384
00:21:07,654 --> 00:21:11,254
So, that's when you found out about the secret of this storeroom!

385
00:21:11,254 --> 00:21:14,654
I'm sorry!

386
00:22:38,538 --> 00:22:40,538
And? How was it?

387
00:22:40,538 --> 00:22:42,238
Our deduction!

388
00:22:42,238 --> 00:22:44,438
Did we knock you out?

389
00:22:44,438 --> 00:22:47,738
Great job.

390
00:22:47,738 --> 00:22:50,438
Considering it was Heiji.

391
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:53,938
Sorry, sorry.

392
00:22:53,938 --> 00:22:58,538
I went to the detective agency to do some business.

393
00:22:58,538 --> 00:22:59,838
And heard these kids saying

394
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:03,838
that they wanted to surprise the hell out of you.

395
00:23:03,838 --> 00:23:06,338
So, I dropped them a few hints.

396
00:23:07,438 --> 00:23:10,938
No, Conan, you shouldn't call your teacher by his first name.

397
00:23:10,938 --> 00:23:12,838
Huh? Teacher?

398
00:23:12,838 --> 00:23:17,438
Right, Mr. Hattori is your teacher, isn't he, Conan?

399
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,138
Just what do you mean?

400
00:23:19,138 --> 00:23:21,038
I showed them this picture.

401
00:23:22,338 --> 00:23:25,838
So, I'm your teacher at being a detective.

402
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:31,138
Hey, isn't this the picture you took for fun some time ago.

403
00:23:31,138 --> 00:23:34,338
Hey, Kudo! Something's on the ground.

404
00:23:35,838 --> 00:23:38,638
Hattori, how dare you.

405
00:23:38,638 --> 00:23:42,738
But, we didn't get to see Conan surprised out of his wits.

406
00:23:42,738 --> 00:23:44,138
You can say that again.

407
00:23:44,138 --> 00:23:45,838
It's too bad.

408
00:23:45,838 --> 00:23:48,338
You shouldn't rely on someone else.

409
00:23:48,338 --> 00:23:50,338
Right...

410
00:23:50,338 --> 00:23:53,538
If you want to realize your dreams,

411
00:23:53,538 --> 00:23:57,038
you've got to exert effort on your own!

412
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:00,138
That's not for you to say, Hattori.

413
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,880
Next Conan's Hint:

414
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,760
"Cracker"

415
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,020
The next episode centers around a racket involving a lucky charm.

416
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,740
The two great friends from Osaka are also making an appearance.
