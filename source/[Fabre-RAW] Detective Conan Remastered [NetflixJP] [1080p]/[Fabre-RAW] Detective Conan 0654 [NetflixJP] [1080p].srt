1
00:00:02,329 --> 00:00:04,929
Soon after the killing of Design Company President

2
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:08,629
Kohei Wakamatsu in his villa in Karuizawa,

3
00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:11,991
his son Ikuro was poisoned to death in his house in Tokyo.

4
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:14,329
For some strange reason,

5
00:00:14,329 --> 00:00:16,929
the pieces other than those that Ikuro ate

6
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:19,999
didn't have poison on them.

7
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:24,003
How on earth did the culprit poison Ikuro to death?

8
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:29,029
Inspector Kansuke Yamato of the Nagano Prefectural Police realized that

9
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,229
the bath room that President Wakamatsu was killed in

10
00:00:31,229 --> 00:00:34,029
was made with tiles that cause an illusion

11
00:00:34,029 --> 00:00:37,029
called "Crazy Diamond".

12
00:00:37,029 --> 00:00:40,019
Although President Wakamatsu's dying message

13
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:42,829
that had vanished was revived...

14
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:48,027
Three letters of the alphabet were written, "S-O-N"!

15
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:49,729
Son.

16
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:51,029
His son?

17
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,629
If all cases were men,

18
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:13,629
all hidden mysteries are women.

19
00:01:13,629 --> 00:01:16,829
Crazy Diamond is newly discovered. The mystery of poison.

20
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:18,529
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:18,529 --> 00:01:20,429
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:22,829
His name is Detective Conan!

23
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,250
"Design of Poison and Illusion (Poison)"

24
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,155
Hey! Are you serious?

25
00:02:56,155 --> 00:02:58,157
You mean the one who was killed in Tokyo tonight

26
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,280
is the son of the president who was killed in the villa

27
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,480
in Karuizawa a month ago?

28
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,165
Yeah, no doubt about it!

29
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:09,880
Maybe the culprit deliberately left those letters behind

30
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,171
to set the son up as the killer.

31
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:14,780
If so, I'm sure the culprit

32
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,480
would've left the body easier to discover.

33
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,580
The culprit wouldn't have gone through the trouble

34
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:23,280
of using the crazy diamond illusion to hide the message.

35
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,780
If so, it's highly probable

36
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,180
that somebody held a grudge of some sort.

37
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,780
Yes. The culprit who knew that the son had killed the president,

38
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,191
avenged the president's death.

39
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:35,680
I guess this deduction is appropriate.

40
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,197
Well, there's also a probability

41
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:39,780
that an accomplice tried to shut him up.

42
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,980
"SON" is the only message left.

43
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,280
It's only natural to believe that

44
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,680
-this is the doing of one culprit then? -So, that's the story!

45
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,780
I gave you all this information already,

46
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,209
so don't you dare come up with any other victims, get that!

47
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:52,211
Yeah.

48
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:54,880
So the person who deliberately called us over

49
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,780
to the president's residence in Osaka

50
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,280
and showed us the trick of the vanishing letters is...

51
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,780
Could most probably be the culprit who killed his son, Ikuro this time.

52
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,180
Yeah.

53
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,380
It seems as if the culprit wanted to tell us to hurry

54
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,980
and realize the illusionary trick of the crazy diamond.

55
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,380
It's hard to think that the culprit Ikuro

56
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,980
would ever give out such a clue besides.

57
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,580
The question is

58
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,237
why the President's wife hid the fact about the tiles of this bath room

59
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:22,241
being the same as those of the villa in Karuizawa.

60
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:26,680
If the culprit wanted us to realize the crazy diamond effect,

61
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,580
it could be that the wife was getting in the way.

62
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,251
You know, sonny?

63
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:33,780
You seem to be talking differently

64
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,180
from the way you were a while ago.

65
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,080
Because when you were with everyone,

66
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,480
you were talking like an ordinary child would.

67
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,280
But, now you're talking just like a detective would.

68
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,980
You see, well...

69
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,680
We're just playing detective!

70
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,280
I'm keeping this brat company playing detective!

71
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,273
Sonny, make sure you don't get in the way of investigation!

72
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:58,880
Because he's a really sharp high school detective, you see!

73
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,980
Okay.

74
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,980
By the way, did the president talk of me that way to everybody?

75
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,580
Yes, with every chance he had.

76
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,380
He used to say, he wish that he had a successor like Heiji, and yet...

77
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,380
grieved that his son was no good.

78
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,680
His son was no good?

79
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,080
Did he have a daughter or something?

80
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,080
No. I just think he meant compared to you, Heiji.

81
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,480
I would like to confirm once more.

82
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,080
Is the position that you're standing in right now

83
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,480
is the same as the time when Ikuro ate the poisoned baumkuchen and fell?

84
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,880
-Yes. -Yes.

85
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,280
Ms. Yonehara!

86
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,080
Where were you back then?

87
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,325
Oh, yes.

88
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,980
I was at that position you're in right now, Inspector,

89
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,280
holding the tray with the baumkuchen on it.

90
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,180
What?

91
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,680
Not so loud!

92
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,337
You mean the one who killed the president was his son, Ikuro?

93
00:05:58,337 --> 00:06:00,680
-It's a secret, okay? -What?

94
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,980
Everybody thinks that the incident of the president

95
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,880
and Ikuro being killed

96
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,080
was committed by somebody who had a grudge against both of them

97
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,380
and is one and the same culprit, right?

98
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,351
If so, maybe it'd be better to keep it a secret, no?

99
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:15,980
Right. The motive of the culprit this time

100
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,280
is probably different from the motive of having killed the president.

101
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,359
It could be a grudge against the president

102
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,880
having been killed, you see.

103
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,980
So, Officer Takagi, won't you ask everybody secretly?

104
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,369
Especially find out if there was anyone who specially cared for him.

105
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:33,080
A secret from the Inspector?

106
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,373
If you want to deceive the enemy,

107
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:36,380
you have to first deceive the people on your side.

108
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,980
Heiji, I wonder what Officer Takagi and he are talking about in secret?

109
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,180
Beats me.

110
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,280
Talking about talking, what was that thing a while ago about?

111
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,580
You said that you had something you had to talk to me about.

112
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,080
It's not something that I should be talking about

113
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,680
at a time like this though.

114
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,680
The thing is...

115
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,395
What?

116
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:58,680
Shinichi did?

117
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:04,980
-What? -Don't worry about it.

118
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,180
Ghads.

119
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,380
Hey, hey.

120
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,880
What a thing to talk about at a murder site?

121
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,180
And? No one else

122
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,180
but Ms. Satake and Ms. Yonehara touched the baumkuchen?

123
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,419
You mean Shinichi really confessed to you?

124
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:21,680
Yeah.

125
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,780
I took a trip to London the other day, you see.

126
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,480
And Shinichi coincidentally happened to be there, too.

127
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,880
All of a sudden in front of Big Ben...

128
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,433
How lucky, Ran! How I envy you!

129
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:36,435
Really romantic.

130
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:39,280
And then? What happened after that?

131
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,080
Nothing really...

132
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,280
You met him and called him too, didn't you?

133
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,180
Nothing in particular.

134
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,980
Then, you should've called him!

135
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,580
But it's like I forced him to confess.

136
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,380
And besides, I wanted to keep prolonging

137
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,880
this sense of happiness for a little longer, you see...

138
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,463
I sort of felt like if I called him from my side,

139
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:08,467
this dreamy incident would somehow shatter to pieces.

140
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,980
You're being sort of lukewarm, Ran.

141
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,473
Your partner's already cornered

142
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:16,475
and raising a white flag, you know.

143
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:19,680
Why didn't you push him a little farther and soak yourself in victory?

144
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,180
Victory...

145
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,980
Then, I'll tell you what we'll do!

146
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,880
I'll conjure up courage and confess to Heiji, too!

147
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
What?

148
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,780
After that, you should conjure up courage too

149
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,280
and confirm with Shinichi whether it was a dream or not too!

150
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,980
-What do you think? -What?

151
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,080
Hey, you guys.

152
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,580
What are you guys fussing over from a while ago?

153
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,480
We're in the midst of on-the-site-inspection, you know?

154
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,080
We're in the midst of an inspection conference!

155
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,507
So, keep out of it, thank you.

156
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:49,880
What?

157
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,180
How lucky, Ran! Promise, okay?

158
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,519
Okay. I'll show Ran what I can do for her sake, too.

159
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,780
Heiji, get ready for this, I'm coming for you!

160
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,080
How frightening!

161
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,529
I wonder what the heck she's glaring at me for.

162
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:12,180
Inspector.

163
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,280
I think it's meaningless to go any further, don't you?

164
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,180
Right. The question is,

165
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,539
not where everyone was standing at the time of the incident,

166
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:23,280
but how the culprit made that stupid son pick up

167
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,280
the poisoned baumkuchen out of the two that were left, isn't it?

168
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,547
Unless that mystery is solved,

169
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:31,580
no matter how much on-site investigation there is...

170
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,180
No. This is not an official on site investigation,

171
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,580
but rather, an informal on site investigation performed voluntarily.

172
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,557
What?

173
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,280
If it's an official on site investigation,

174
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,080
you need a warrant issued from court on hand

175
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,563
before starting the investigation

176
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:46,080
and be able to show it at the scene.

177
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,680
They would have to make us understand

178
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,980
the contents of the warrant, too.

179
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,580
Have it on hand before starting?

180
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,880
Need them to understand the contents?

181
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,180
That's right!

182
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,577
That method still existed!

183
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:00,180
Inspector!

184
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,581
I'm going to borrow the housekeeper again for a while!

185
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,780
Huh?

186
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,585
And, we'll borrow the forensic officer who is outside too!

187
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:07,980
Huh?

188
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,580
Sorry, but will you conjure some story up for us in the meantime!

189
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,380
Ghads, going off on their own like that...

190
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,980
-So, there it is? -Yeah.

191
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,580
It seems that powdered poison's been sprinkled on the door knob.

192
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,603
There's no mistake about this being Ikuro's room, is there?

193
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,605
No.

194
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:29,780
But why would there be poison in a place like this?

195
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,180
Ikuro didn't coincidentally pick up

196
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,380
the poisoned baumkuchen out of the two that were left.

197
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,617
He had poison on his hand even before he picked it up!

198
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:40,619
Poison was already on his hand when he left this room,

199
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:43,980
grabbed the door knob and closed the door!

200
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,980
So, if it were Ikuro who always ate cake with his hands,

201
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,080
no matter which baumkuchen he picked up,

202
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,380
he would've swallowed the poison along with it!

203
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,635
I see!

204
00:10:56,635 --> 00:11:00,380
The problem is, who put the poison on the doorknob.

205
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,180
Is there poison on the floor too?

206
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,980
Yeah. On the floor.

207
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:13,080
Maybe that poison powder was cut off about 10 centimeters?

208
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,480
Yeah.

209
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,480
There was about that much open space on the floor.

210
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,880
But, how did you know about it?

211
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,380
I see.

212
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,880
If so, it's not difficult to figure out who put poison on the doorknob.

213
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,667
If only we can find it!

214
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,080
What?

215
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,671
Let you check the slippers?

216
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,180
What the heck is going on from a while ago?

217
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,280
We're in the midst of interrogation!

218
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,280
Come on, loosen up!

219
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,280
It's important!

220
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,683
Of course we need your slippers too, Inspector!

221
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:47,980
It goes for all of you waiting outside the room too, you know!

222
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,380
Put the slippers you're wearing right now

223
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,080
into the bag with your name on it!

224
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,580
Then, you don't really have any idea of anyone

225
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,680
who may have had a grudge against the president or Ikuro?

226
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,705
No. I don't know about the son,

227
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:09,480
but I think the president was liked by everybody, wasn't he?

228
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,280
The president was a workaholic

229
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,180
and left his family to fend for themselves, so...

230
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,715
It seems that he's been divorced twice, though.

231
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:18,180
Divorced twice...

232
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,180
Then, on the contrary,

233
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,721
was there anyone who cared for the president?

234
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:23,880
Huh?

235
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,080
Aren't you talking about people who had a grudge against him?

236
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,480
Yes, just for your reference.

237
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,280
I guess that would be Managing Director Shiina.

238
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,080
It seems that they used to go around together

239
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,180
since the establishment of the company.

240
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,180
Yes. I was classmates with the president at the university

241
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,480
and have been acquainted with him for quite some time.

242
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,745
Several years ago, I received a bronze fountain pen from him

243
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:50,749
in celebration of my 30th anniversary working for him too.

244
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:51,980
That's...

245
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,080
the fountain pen that you lend Mrs. Wakamatsu a while ago?

246
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,280
Yes. It seems he gave the other employees

247
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,780
bronze wristwatches, though.

248
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,480
By the way, is there anyone

249
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,680
who cared for the president more than you?

250
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,280
Secretary Satake, I guess.

251
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,380
She took care of the president to the point

252
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,080
where his previous wife used to get jealous, you see.

253
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,280
It's only natural that a secretary

254
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,480
takes care of the president, isn't it?

255
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,680
But, what does this have to do with anything?

256
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,680
Just to be sure, I just wanted to know

257
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,180
how much the president was loved.

258
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,580
If so, I don't think anyone cared more for him

259
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,180
than the housekeeper Ms. Yonehara.

260
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,080
Because her mother, who was a single parent

261
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,795
also worked as a housekeeper for this family

262
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,080
and when she died of an illness,

263
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,080
he took Sakurako in

264
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,980
and raised her like she were his real daughter,

265
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,380
then eventually hired her as a housekeeper here.

266
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,809
Yes.

267
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,080
I have no words that can express

268
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,813
the gratitude I feel for the president.

269
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:57,380
He also paid for my school tuition.

270
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:01,580
But I think Mr. Fujinami the chief designer, liked him even more.

271
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,680
Due to his foul mouth,

272
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,825
he was fired from various companies,

273
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:08,580
but he said that the president saw through his skills

274
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,280
and picked him up.

275
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,480
Even at the president's funeral,

276
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,880
he was the one who was crying most too.

277
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,680
I see, I see.

278
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,980
Hey, Mrs. Wakamatsu.

279
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,480
You're there, aren't you?

280
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,580
All we need now are your slippers, you know!

281
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,380
We found no poison detected

282
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,180
on the slippers of the others, you see.

283
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,480
The poison powder got on the slippers because

284
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,825
when poison was sprinkled onto the doorknob of Ikuro's room,

285
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:40,024
Mrs. Wakamatsu...
when poison was sprinkled onto the doorknob of Ikuro's room,

286
00:14:40,024 --> 00:14:42,861
Mrs. Wakamatsu...

287
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:44,037
Oh, no!

288
00:14:44,037 --> 00:14:47,332
The cause of death hydrogen cyanide again.

289
00:14:47,332 --> 00:14:49,209
Looks to be so.

290
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:52,871
But, isn't this suicide?

291
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:55,215
When we left this study,

292
00:14:55,215 --> 00:14:58,302
the last one who closed the door was that Inspector, wasn't it?

293
00:14:59,303 --> 00:15:02,514
But, back then, the vice-president was still alive.

294
00:15:02,514 --> 00:15:04,433
If the detective boy from Osaka and his friend were the first ones

295
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:06,101
to open the door of this room and find the corpse,

296
00:15:06,101 --> 00:15:08,103
of the vice-president who was in the study,

297
00:15:08,103 --> 00:15:11,398
where the police officer was on guard,

298
00:15:11,398 --> 00:15:14,234
what else can it be but suicide!

299
00:15:14,234 --> 00:15:17,237
True. If this is to be considered a homicide,

300
00:15:17,237 --> 00:15:18,897
it's a locked room murder.

301
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:21,200
In other words, an impossible crime.

302
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,901
True.

303
00:15:23,118 --> 00:15:25,913
It's not impossible to commit, though.

304
00:15:25,913 --> 00:15:29,500
Because there are many suspicious looking things on the table!

305
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:35,631
The black tea that housekeeper Yonehara served us

306
00:15:35,631 --> 00:15:37,424
is still only half drunk.

307
00:15:37,424 --> 00:15:38,634
The cap of the fountain pen

308
00:15:38,634 --> 00:15:40,919
that Managing Director, Shiina lent Mrs. Wakamatsu,

309
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:42,638
is on the end tip of the top of the pen,

310
00:15:42,638 --> 00:15:44,723
with the lid sticking out.

311
00:15:44,723 --> 00:15:46,433
The contract that the secretary Ms. Satake

312
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:50,103
had asked Mrs. Wakamatsu to sign and stamp is only half done.

313
00:15:50,103 --> 00:15:52,931
And the eye drops that

314
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:54,608
she received from Mr. Fujinami the chief designer

315
00:15:54,608 --> 00:15:58,320
seems to have been used just a little!

316
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,531
They're all suspicious, don't you think?

317
00:16:00,531 --> 00:16:02,032
In other words...

318
00:16:02,032 --> 00:16:04,943
If you use the things on this desk right,

319
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:06,945
you don't have to be in this study

320
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:11,208
to poison Mrs. Wakamatsu to death!

321
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:14,336
The thick dictionary that was on the ground near her,

322
00:16:14,336 --> 00:16:17,714
and the case that it was inside is super suspicious, too.

323
00:16:17,714 --> 00:16:21,510
It seems that the "wa" part was opened.

324
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,220
Judging from the circumstances,

325
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,722
it is highly likely that she tried to look for something

326
00:16:25,722 --> 00:16:28,967
using that dictionary, and touched the poison.

327
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:31,520
For example, maybe she wanted to look up

328
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,022
a Kanji character that she couldn't read.

329
00:16:34,022 --> 00:16:40,112
If so, the contract that Mrs. Wakamatsu was asked to sign and stamp

330
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:43,824
or the instructions sheet of the eye drops are fishy.

331
00:16:43,824 --> 00:16:46,201
Yes. The culprit who knew that

332
00:16:46,201 --> 00:16:47,703
there were some difficult kanji characters

333
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:50,539
or sentences in the contract probably made it

334
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:55,419
so that she would pick up the dictionary that had poison on it.

335
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:57,004
Hey, hold it!

336
00:16:57,004 --> 00:16:58,630
I don't think there're any words

337
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,132
that the vice-president couldn't read.

338
00:17:00,132 --> 00:17:03,001
She held the top grade kanji evaluation degree.

339
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:06,305
Besides, if you're going to suspect us,

340
00:17:06,305 --> 00:17:08,724
please do so after you read the letter in the envelope

341
00:17:08,724 --> 00:17:10,309
that she gave to me.

342
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:11,935
Letter in an envelope?

343
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,604
The vice-president had asked me

344
00:17:14,604 --> 00:17:17,024
to submit that enveloped letter to the police

345
00:17:17,024 --> 00:17:20,736
if in case something should ever happen to her.

346
00:17:20,736 --> 00:17:25,023
That enveloped letter was kept in the safe of this house.

347
00:17:25,198 --> 00:17:28,535
The content was Mrs. Wakamatsu's letter of confession.

348
00:17:28,535 --> 00:17:31,621
When we rushed to the bath room

349
00:17:31,621 --> 00:17:34,124
after hearing that the president was stabbed to death in Karuizawa.

350
00:17:34,124 --> 00:17:36,626
The fact was, his son was standing hiding behind the door

351
00:17:36,626 --> 00:17:39,421
holding a knife and smeared with blood.

352
00:17:39,421 --> 00:17:41,423
She had written a confession in her own handwriting

353
00:17:41,423 --> 00:17:44,301
that she, without thinking decided to protect her son.

354
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:47,512
She protected him because the president's son knew that

355
00:17:47,512 --> 00:17:51,049
she was the one who had been embezzling money from the company.

356
00:17:51,224 --> 00:17:53,051
That's why she made the son cling to his father's corpse

357
00:17:53,226 --> 00:17:54,603
to cover up the blood that had splattered on him

358
00:17:54,603 --> 00:17:56,521
when he stabbed his father.

359
00:17:56,521 --> 00:17:57,731
Before the police arrived,

360
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:59,816
she left traces of an outsider having committed the crime,

361
00:17:59,816 --> 00:18:01,401
hid the murder weapon

362
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:03,904
and on a later date got rid of it.

363
00:18:03,904 --> 00:18:06,323
She also confessed that she hid the dying message

364
00:18:06,323 --> 00:18:08,408
written by the president by using illusion,

365
00:18:08,408 --> 00:18:11,620
but it dawned on her that maybe she may be killed by the son one day

366
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:15,707
to shut her up because she knew of the crime he committed.

367
00:18:15,707 --> 00:18:19,077
So, she had written that she would like that dying message

368
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:21,838
submitted to the police as evidence if ever such a day should come.

369
00:18:21,838 --> 00:18:25,083
This is how the letter of confession ended.

370
00:18:26,301 --> 00:18:28,720
Were you the only one as her secretary

371
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,515
who knew of the existence of this enveloped letter?

372
00:18:31,515 --> 00:18:33,091
Yes, most probably.

373
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:37,095
The vice-president seemed to have been opening

374
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:38,230
and checking the safe every night

375
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,399
to see if the envelope had been opened or not.

376
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:43,902
So, maybe there were others who were suspicious of her.

377
00:18:43,902 --> 00:18:47,697
I thought that Mrs. Wakamatsu was hiding something, too.

378
00:18:48,532 --> 00:18:50,700
When I came inside to clean this room,

379
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,111
I saw her in front of the safe.

380
00:18:53,328 --> 00:18:56,498
"Knock before you come into the room!"

381
00:18:56,498 --> 00:18:59,501
So saying, she scolded me severely.

382
00:18:59,501 --> 00:19:00,710
But, as far as this is concerned,

383
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:04,297
I think the others were also aware of it.

384
00:19:04,297 --> 00:19:06,133
Because Mrs. Wakamatsu used to invite

385
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:09,803
a lot of company people over to discuss things.

386
00:19:09,803 --> 00:19:13,432
Which means, that although not clearly,

387
00:19:13,432 --> 00:19:15,725
all of you knew of the existence of this enveloped letter.

388
00:19:15,725 --> 00:19:16,935
Inspector!

389
00:19:16,935 --> 00:19:20,105
Poison was detected on Mrs. Wakamatsu's slippers!

390
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:21,139
What?

391
00:19:21,314 --> 00:19:24,401
It seems that she's the one who sprinkled poison powder

392
00:19:24,401 --> 00:19:27,904
onto the door knob of Ikuro's room!

393
00:19:27,904 --> 00:19:29,147
There was a residue of poison detected

394
00:19:29,322 --> 00:19:31,825
in between the space of the wooden floor right below the door knob.

395
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,618
Moreover, the space taken up by the slippers

396
00:19:33,618 --> 00:19:36,538
matched the space where no poison powder was spilled o the floor.

397
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:38,498
I see.

398
00:19:38,498 --> 00:19:42,627
Because she feared that she may be killed one day,

399
00:19:42,627 --> 00:19:45,422
Mrs. Wakamatsu took measures beforehand.

400
00:19:45,422 --> 00:19:47,165
Oh, no.

401
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:50,010
It could be so.

402
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:54,598
Because it would presumably be very difficult to change her slippers,

403
00:19:54,598 --> 00:19:57,175
and make her wear slippers with poison on them instead.

404
00:19:57,175 --> 00:20:00,020
And poison was also detected from the Japanese dictionary

405
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,181
that was found on the floor near Mrs. Wakamatsu's corpse.

406
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:04,816
Poison was found only on the bottom

407
00:20:04,816 --> 00:20:08,236
left of the side that the book is opened from.

408
00:20:08,236 --> 00:20:10,739
But inside the case that the dictionary was put inside,

409
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:13,533
was a bag with poison pasted on

410
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:16,119
and it was slightly torn.

411
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:18,705
It could've been that someone hid the poison there,

412
00:20:18,705 --> 00:20:21,208
where the bag ripped accidentally

413
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,918
and so the poison spilled onto the part of the dictionary

414
00:20:22,918 --> 00:20:25,203
where poison was detected.

415
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:29,925
If so, it could've been Mrs. Wakamatsu who hid it there.

416
00:20:29,925 --> 00:20:31,718
It could be.

417
00:20:31,718 --> 00:20:33,929
After poisoning the son to death,

418
00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:36,723
she hid the bag of poison there.

419
00:20:36,723 --> 00:20:38,600
It is also thinkable that be it he was the president's son,

420
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,435
a son is still a son.

421
00:20:40,435 --> 00:20:42,020
After having killed him,

422
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,397
she was probably overwhelmed by feelings of regret.

423
00:20:44,397 --> 00:20:46,399
So, she put the poison that spilled out of the bag

424
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:50,111
into her mouth and killed herself.

425
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:53,231
Maybe she didn't participate in the informal voluntary

426
00:20:53,406 --> 00:20:54,908
on site investigation because...

427
00:20:54,908 --> 00:20:57,235
She was already planning to kill herself

428
00:20:57,235 --> 00:20:59,237
as soon as she got to be alone.

429
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:04,000
Didn't you find anything on top of the desk in the study?

430
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,245
No. No poison was detected.

431
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,131
There seems to have been no difficult words on the contract

432
00:21:10,131 --> 00:21:13,251
or the instruction sheet of the eye drops either.

433
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:15,253
Then who was it that called me over

434
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:17,013
to the president's house in Osaka

435
00:21:17,013 --> 00:21:21,601
so that I would see through the crazy diamond illusion?

436
00:21:21,601 --> 00:21:26,731
Maybe she used you to try it out.

437
00:21:26,731 --> 00:21:30,610
Since her husband kept telling her that you were a great detective,

438
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,529
she probably figured that if you couldn't solve the illusionary trick,

439
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:34,114
no one else would!

440
00:21:34,114 --> 00:21:36,700
She didn't dream at all that you would be bringing along

441
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,036
a genuine famed detective with you.

442
00:21:40,036 --> 00:21:42,831
Then, are you saying that she deliberately committed a murder

443
00:21:42,831 --> 00:21:45,283
right in front of that great detective?

444
00:21:45,283 --> 00:21:46,918
How should I know?

445
00:21:46,918 --> 00:21:51,006
Maybe she couldn't stop because she already laced the poison!

446
00:21:51,006 --> 00:21:53,291
I mean, I hate to say this but...

447
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,635
If the vice-president is the killer,

448
00:21:55,635 --> 00:21:57,295
can we go home already?

449
00:21:57,295 --> 00:21:59,806
It's almost time for the last train, too.

450
00:21:59,806 --> 00:22:03,810
I've got to go home and discuss tonight's matters with my wife.

451
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:06,521
I'll stick around as long as you need me, though.

452
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:09,307
Well, I'd like to ask you

453
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:11,309
how Mrs. Wakamatsu was acting before she died, too.

454
00:22:11,526 --> 00:22:15,113
Please cooperate with our investigation a little while longer.

455
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,916
Next Conan's Hint:

456
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:06,030
"Wristwatch"

457
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,425
Today is Children's Day.

458
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:09,427
Conan, how old are you now after yesterday?

459
00:24:09,604 --> 00:24:10,640
A secret.
