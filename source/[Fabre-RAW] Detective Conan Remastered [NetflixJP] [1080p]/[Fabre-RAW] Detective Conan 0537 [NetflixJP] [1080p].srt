1
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:04,338
Calling all officers!

2
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:06,438
Head for the Nabei residence on the double!

3
00:00:06,438 --> 00:00:07,987
There's a possibility that the suspect

4
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:09,989
has possession of Takagi's gun!

5
00:00:10,238 --> 00:00:13,738
Be on full guard when coming in contact with him!

6
00:00:13,738 --> 00:00:17,338
Listen! Life is lost in a split second!

7
00:00:22,938 --> 00:00:26,638
Darn, you asked for it.

8
00:00:26,638 --> 00:00:28,838
Darn! Dogs.

9
00:00:28,838 --> 00:00:30,538
They've figured it out!

10
00:00:30,538 --> 00:00:33,038
No, Officer Sato?

11
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:41,138
Officer... Sato...

12
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:45,238
Officer Takagi was shot?

13
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:47,538
Why does Officer Takagi have to die just because

14
00:00:47,538 --> 00:00:50,338
we promised to go to the hot spring together?

15
00:00:50,338 --> 00:00:53,538
-Hot spring? -Officer Takagi!

16
00:00:53,538 --> 00:00:54,938
Oh, no, I mean...

17
00:00:54,938 --> 00:00:56,338
You know, the usual?

18
00:00:56,338 --> 00:00:58,438
The evidence that he coincidentally put inside his pocket

19
00:00:58,438 --> 00:01:00,039
during the investigation

20
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:03,138
saved his life from the culprit's bullet.

21
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:06,438
Then, how is Officer Takagi?

22
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:10,538
He's gone through treatment and is sleeping in his room now.

23
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:12,051
He's fast asleep.

24
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:16,055
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

25
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:18,638
Saturday nights are for mystery.

26
00:01:18,638 --> 00:01:20,638
A forewarning letter of crime arrives from Thief Kid.

27
00:01:20,638 --> 00:01:23,338
His next target is an innovative formidable safe.

28
00:01:23,338 --> 00:01:24,738
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:24,738 --> 00:01:26,638
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:26,638 --> 00:01:28,838
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

31
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:14,932
"Thief Kid vs. The Formidable Safe (Part 1)"

32
00:03:16,532 --> 00:03:18,532
An almost suicidal attempt to arrest the culprit!

33
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,179
It was announced later,

34
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:22,632
that a police officer, while being shot by the culprit's bullet,

35
00:03:22,632 --> 00:03:25,932
pinned the culprit down, and this eventually lead to the arrest!

36
00:03:25,932 --> 00:03:29,632
So, this is the article about you, Officer Takagi, isn't it?

37
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:33,132
Yes, well... it turned out that way to begin with

38
00:03:33,132 --> 00:03:35,632
because my gun was stolen by the culprit, you see.

39
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,532
You'd better be grateful,

40
00:03:37,532 --> 00:03:39,232
because thanks to my genius deduction,

41
00:03:39,232 --> 00:03:41,332
we found out that

42
00:03:41,332 --> 00:03:45,032
there was a scar on the back of the serial killer.

43
00:03:45,032 --> 00:03:47,932
Although like always, I don't remember a thing.

44
00:03:47,932 --> 00:03:50,532
But, I'm sure glad the case was solved!

45
00:03:50,532 --> 00:03:53,532
Yeah, me too!

46
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:55,032
Including a lot of other things...

47
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:01,632
Officer Takagi.

48
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:03,632
Officer Takagi?

49
00:04:03,632 --> 00:04:06,232
Your face is red.

50
00:04:07,832 --> 00:04:10,229
Did something good happen?

51
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:11,432
Oh, no...

52
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:14,232
Nothing in particular.

53
00:04:14,232 --> 00:04:17,432
I know! Because I saw!

54
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:21,332
What? What did you see?

55
00:04:21,332 --> 00:04:24,532
Well, he was with Officer Sato in the hospital room and...

56
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:25,932
Conan, hold it.

57
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,632
Just because they're always on the winning end.

58
00:04:30,232 --> 00:04:32,532
They think they can keep pushing their weight around.

59
00:04:32,532 --> 00:04:34,832
Inspector Nakamori?

60
00:04:34,832 --> 00:04:36,255
As for me, I repeatedly, almost,

61
00:04:36,255 --> 00:04:39,232
but never, get to nab that snobbish thief

62
00:04:39,232 --> 00:04:43,732
So, I've been disappointed and burned, God knows how many times.

63
00:04:43,732 --> 00:04:46,032
Hot!

64
00:04:46,032 --> 00:04:47,332
Oh, I'm sorry!

65
00:04:48,732 --> 00:04:49,932
Was it too hot?

66
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:51,832
No, it's okay.

67
00:04:53,632 --> 00:04:55,532
My heart is chilled,

68
00:04:55,532 --> 00:04:58,277
so something this hot is just right for me!

69
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:00,532
Your heart is chilled?

70
00:05:00,532 --> 00:05:04,283
Well, Thief Kid's been quite quiet recently

71
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:06,285
so in other words, I kind of have nothing to live for.

72
00:05:06,532 --> 00:05:10,289
Haven't you read the papers?

73
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:11,132
The papers?

74
00:05:11,132 --> 00:05:13,732
There's a really big article on the front pages!

75
00:05:16,032 --> 00:05:17,232
It says that Thief Kid

76
00:05:17,232 --> 00:05:21,732
sent a challenging letter to Jirokichi Suzuki, his arch rival.

77
00:05:27,832 --> 00:05:29,432
Advisor Suzuki!

78
00:05:29,432 --> 00:05:31,232
Just what is the meaning of this?

79
00:05:31,232 --> 00:05:34,332
Please tell us in more detail!

80
00:05:34,332 --> 00:05:37,332
What on earth is Kid going to come and steal?

81
00:05:39,032 --> 00:05:40,319
Beats me...

82
00:05:41,432 --> 00:05:42,932
What does that mean?

83
00:05:44,032 --> 00:05:47,732
On the letter of warning, this is what was written.

84
00:05:47,732 --> 00:05:51,032
"I'd advise you to resign yourself, Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki."

85
00:05:51,032 --> 00:05:55,332
"Let's not fight a futile battle and surrender solemnly,"

86
00:05:55,332 --> 00:05:58,132
"when the moon is swallowed by the darkness."

87
00:05:58,132 --> 00:06:00,339
"And I, in front of your surprised eyes of wonder, break into"

88
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:02,932
"the great safe that has been handed down to you for generations,"

89
00:06:02,932 --> 00:06:06,032
"Thief Kid."

90
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,732
The great safe,

91
00:06:07,732 --> 00:06:09,232
don't tell me...

92
00:06:09,232 --> 00:06:10,349
Right.

93
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:14,132
The masterpiece of a lifetime that the great puppeteer,

94
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:18,132
Kichiemon Samizu is said to have made just before his death.

95
00:06:18,132 --> 00:06:21,132
The impregnable great safe,

96
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:23,132
Iron Badger!

97
00:06:24,532 --> 00:06:27,232
This is that letter of challenge!

98
00:06:29,132 --> 00:06:32,032
Well, it seems that he's more interested in the safe itself

99
00:06:32,032 --> 00:06:34,373
than the contents of the safe, but,

100
00:06:34,532 --> 00:06:36,375
I sure am interested to see

101
00:06:36,532 --> 00:06:40,132
whether he can break through the door of Iron Badger

102
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:42,132
that up to this time,

103
00:06:42,132 --> 00:06:45,332
counter-attacked even the greatest known thieves of all times

104
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:47,632
that attempted to break into our house.

105
00:06:47,632 --> 00:06:49,932
Very interesting, my foot!

106
00:06:49,932 --> 00:06:51,432
Despite this letter of challenge being sent here,

107
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:54,032
it's very upsetting for we the police

108
00:06:54,032 --> 00:06:57,132
to think that the press got this information before we did!

109
00:06:57,132 --> 00:06:59,032
It's Inspector Nakamori from the Metropolitan Police Station!

110
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:02,032
Just what do you propose to do this time to cope with Kid?

111
00:07:02,032 --> 00:07:03,932
Inspector Nakamori, any comments?

112
00:07:03,932 --> 00:07:05,632
Inspector!

113
00:07:05,632 --> 00:07:08,732
How should I know? I just found out a while ago myself.

114
00:07:08,732 --> 00:07:13,532
Well, take a good look at the picture on the letter of challenge!

115
00:07:17,032 --> 00:07:20,132
It's different from the usual illustration!

116
00:07:20,132 --> 00:07:23,932
That's why I didn't report it to the police

117
00:07:23,932 --> 00:07:26,425
because there's a possibility that it's an imposter.

118
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:29,432
Then, why didn't you say so to the press too?

119
00:07:29,432 --> 00:07:33,732
If I win this match that everybody thinks is genuine,

120
00:07:33,732 --> 00:07:37,632
I can add this to my tale of heroic exploits, can't I?

121
00:07:37,632 --> 00:07:40,832
This old man's... still at it...

122
00:07:40,832 --> 00:07:44,432
At any rate, the police is to stay out of this,

123
00:07:44,432 --> 00:07:46,932
because it isn't Thief Kid.

124
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:55,232
"Three Days Later" -What? It could be an imposter?

125
00:07:55,232 --> 00:07:58,457
The Thief Kid that sent the letter of challenge this time?

126
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:01,932
Yes, that's what Uncle Jirokichi said!

127
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:03,532
I sent you a picture

128
00:08:03,532 --> 00:08:05,432
of the letter of challenge by cell phone, didn't I?

129
00:08:05,432 --> 00:08:06,832
Wasn't there something strange about it?

130
00:08:06,832 --> 00:08:08,032
Yes.

131
00:08:08,032 --> 00:08:12,471
It's true that it wasn't the usual illustration.

132
00:08:12,632 --> 00:08:18,477
Besides, his letters of challenge are always written horizontally.

133
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:22,932
The phrasing in the letter's also old fashioned and quite weird.

134
00:08:22,932 --> 00:08:25,932
Then, why'd you call us over here?

135
00:08:25,932 --> 00:08:27,532
It's a woman's intuition!

136
00:08:27,532 --> 00:08:31,332
I can't help feeling that Kid's going to show up!

137
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:35,832
Well, although it seems like I'm not the only one who feels this way.

138
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:38,497
Don't be off your guard thinking

139
00:08:38,497 --> 00:08:40,132
that this guy's not the real Kid, understand?

140
00:08:40,132 --> 00:08:41,732
Tonight's the night of the new moon,

141
00:08:41,732 --> 00:08:43,032
in other words, the time when the moon will be swallowed by the darkness,

142
00:08:43,032 --> 00:08:44,832
as was written in the letter of challenge!

143
00:08:44,832 --> 00:08:48,032
Make sure you tightly secure the area around the room where the safe is!

144
00:08:48,032 --> 00:08:49,432
Yes, sir!

145
00:08:49,432 --> 00:08:53,132
Inspector Nakamori... he's here.

146
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,832
But, why guard the area around the room?

147
00:08:55,832 --> 00:08:57,532
I think it'd be better if they keep guard

148
00:08:57,532 --> 00:09:00,232
inside the room in front of the safe.

149
00:09:00,232 --> 00:09:03,132
It's because that's not necessary, Detective Mouri.

150
00:09:04,732 --> 00:09:09,532
Would you like to see my pride and joy, Iron Badger?

151
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:12,232
A safe made by Kichiemon Samizu.

152
00:09:12,232 --> 00:09:13,732
Come to think of it, some time ago,

153
00:09:13,732 --> 00:09:17,732
we went through hell at a house of tricks that Kichiemon built.

154
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:31,132
So, is that the impregnable safe?

155
00:09:31,132 --> 00:09:35,132
Just by the looks of it, it looks pretty tough to open.

156
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:45,632
There's nothing in this room, not even furniture.

157
00:09:45,632 --> 00:09:47,532
But, it's embedded in the wall,

158
00:09:47,532 --> 00:09:49,832
and looks more like a room with a safe than a safe.

159
00:09:49,832 --> 00:09:51,732
That's right.

160
00:09:51,732 --> 00:09:54,573
The depth of the room is a little less than 4m,

161
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:56,332
and the size is approximately six mats.

162
00:09:56,332 --> 00:09:59,132
It's surrounded by an iron plate 50cm thick.

163
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,232
In other words, it's a little steel room!

164
00:10:01,232 --> 00:10:06,585
During the war, I took shelter here with my parents

165
00:10:06,832 --> 00:10:09,632
and made it alive through the air raids!

166
00:10:09,632 --> 00:10:12,332
Which means that there are air holes?

167
00:10:12,332 --> 00:10:15,332
Yeah. There's small window for ventilation,

168
00:10:15,332 --> 00:10:18,597
and see, under the door!

169
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:21,932
Do you see that space about 3cm?

170
00:10:21,932 --> 00:10:24,032
But, did you have someone open it for you

171
00:10:24,032 --> 00:10:25,632
when you went outside?

172
00:10:25,632 --> 00:10:29,132
It opens easily from the inside.

173
00:10:29,132 --> 00:10:34,613
I'm the only one who knows how to open it from outside now, though.

174
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:37,132
Okay, then, would you let us take a look at it at closer range?

175
00:10:37,132 --> 00:10:38,332
Hold it!

176
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:43,432
If I remember correctly, you smoke, do you not, Detective Mouri?

177
00:10:43,432 --> 00:10:44,932
Yes.

178
00:10:44,932 --> 00:10:47,332
Would you give me one, please?

179
00:10:47,332 --> 00:10:49,432
Yes, of course.

180
00:10:56,432 --> 00:10:59,732
He's a bodyguard that I hired the other day.

181
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:02,641
He's reticent, but very dependable!

182
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:05,132
Yes, I can tell.

183
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:09,732
If you will excuse me, then.

184
00:11:17,932 --> 00:11:20,132
What's going on? What's that sound?

185
00:11:20,132 --> 00:11:22,132
Well, just watch!

186
00:11:28,432 --> 00:11:31,632
Bars surrounded the room in an instant.

187
00:11:31,632 --> 00:11:35,032
It's a weight sensor that I installed!

188
00:11:35,032 --> 00:11:38,232
It even reacts to the weight of one cigarette!

189
00:11:38,232 --> 00:11:41,232
That's why there's no furniture here.

190
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:43,132
Now do you understand?

191
00:11:43,132 --> 00:11:47,432
He can't even come near this safe!

192
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:53,432
This old man really likes to surround things.

193
00:11:56,432 --> 00:11:59,432
Akitsu, pick up the cigarette that's on the floor inside

194
00:11:59,432 --> 00:12:01,132
and get rid of it!

195
00:12:01,132 --> 00:12:02,701
But...

196
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:06,705
If I go inside, won't the bars come down on me like just now?

197
00:12:06,932 --> 00:12:08,032
You fool!

198
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:09,632
It's switched off!

199
00:12:09,632 --> 00:12:11,832
Just hurry and clean it up now, will you?

200
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,332
Oh, yes, sir!

201
00:12:14,232 --> 00:12:15,632
Gosh.

202
00:12:15,632 --> 00:12:18,432
I tell you, he's a new one I just hired the other day, but...

203
00:12:18,432 --> 00:12:20,432
he sure is useless.

204
00:12:22,732 --> 00:12:25,132
This cigarette...

205
00:12:25,132 --> 00:12:27,132
Should I give it back to Mr. Mouri?

206
00:12:27,132 --> 00:12:28,432
You idiot!

207
00:12:28,432 --> 00:12:30,732
You're going to make him smoke a cigarette that was on the floor?

208
00:12:30,732 --> 00:12:33,032
Hurry up and throw it away in the wastebasket or something!

209
00:12:33,032 --> 00:12:34,532
Yes, sir!

210
00:12:37,432 --> 00:12:39,532
Once you're finished with your business, would you please

211
00:12:39,532 --> 00:12:41,532
stay away from that door?

212
00:12:41,532 --> 00:12:43,732
You're in the way of security.

213
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,732
I'm telling you that it's useless,

214
00:12:47,732 --> 00:12:49,632
because this guy's an imposter!

215
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:57,232
Detective Mouri and everyone else, go on home!

216
00:12:57,232 --> 00:12:59,132
Nothing's going to happen tonight.

217
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:04,532
That goes for you too, little one, arch rival of Kid.

218
00:13:04,532 --> 00:13:06,432
Yep.

219
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:08,032
Okay, shall we head on home then?

220
00:13:08,032 --> 00:13:10,032
What? Are you leaving?

221
00:13:10,032 --> 00:13:12,771
Well, it doesn't seem like Thief Kid will be coming.

222
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:14,232
Right!

223
00:13:14,232 --> 00:13:17,132
Won't you wait just a while longer?

224
00:13:17,832 --> 00:13:19,832
Ouch.

225
00:13:21,832 --> 00:13:24,232
I'm sorry, sonny, are you okay?

226
00:13:24,232 --> 00:13:25,432
Yep.

227
00:13:25,432 --> 00:13:26,785
I was looking for the doggie

228
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:30,432
and on all fours looking for it, so I wasn't looking ahead.

229
00:13:30,432 --> 00:13:33,532
Oh, you mean Uncle's doggie?

230
00:13:33,532 --> 00:13:34,793
Oh, yes.

231
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:38,797
If it's Uncle's doggie Lupin, I heard from Uncle

232
00:13:39,032 --> 00:13:42,801
that he got sick and was hospitalized a while ago.

233
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:45,332
I mean, you're his maid and you didn't know?

234
00:13:45,332 --> 00:13:46,805
Oh, no.

235
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:49,432
I just started working here from today, you see.

236
00:13:49,432 --> 00:13:51,232
But, how disappointing,

237
00:13:51,232 --> 00:13:55,132
because I was looking forward to seeing the cute doggie.

238
00:13:55,132 --> 00:13:58,832
The doggie that I had died last month, so the more...

239
00:13:58,832 --> 00:14:01,132
I see.

240
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,932
Well, I had it from when I was little,

241
00:14:03,932 --> 00:14:06,232
so it was already pretty old.

242
00:14:06,232 --> 00:14:07,632
Oh, no!

243
00:14:07,632 --> 00:14:09,332
I shouldn't be talking to you, I'm still working!

244
00:14:09,332 --> 00:14:11,932
I'm sorry! Excuse me!

245
00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:13,232
Inspector!

246
00:14:14,832 --> 00:14:17,232
Superintendent Chaki's orders are to withdraw from here!

247
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:18,632
What?

248
00:14:18,632 --> 00:14:22,332
It seems that there was pressure from Advisor Suzuki to do so.

249
00:14:22,332 --> 00:14:25,932
Come to think of it, they were talking away with each other

250
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:29,532
about being alma maters of the same university.

251
00:14:31,832 --> 00:14:35,732
Well, there seems to be a super security device here after all.

252
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:40,532
Yeah, I guess they'll be fine without us.

253
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,632
Hey, gramps!

254
00:14:45,632 --> 00:14:48,032
Switch off all the security devices right now!

255
00:14:48,032 --> 00:14:50,432
It's on the floor!

256
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:52,632
The card that wasn't there before!

257
00:14:55,532 --> 00:14:57,432
This is...

258
00:14:57,432 --> 00:14:58,432
"Just as promised,"

259
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:00,432
"I guess I shall come to get the precious treasure"

260
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,232
"that is inside the tummy of the badger,"

261
00:15:02,232 --> 00:15:05,432
"before the moon shows its face out of the darkness."

262
00:15:05,432 --> 00:15:07,932
"Thief Kid!"

263
00:15:07,932 --> 00:15:10,032
This is genuine!

264
00:15:10,032 --> 00:15:13,332
But, how did he put this card in this room?

265
00:15:13,332 --> 00:15:16,895
Why didn't the weight sensor go off?

266
00:15:19,632 --> 00:15:22,332
I guess, all's fine.

267
00:15:36,047 --> 00:15:37,647
Please take a look!

268
00:15:37,647 --> 00:15:40,047
This security group that envelopes the Suzuki residence!

269
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:42,347
It's become more real that Thief Kid will be coming.

270
00:15:42,347 --> 00:15:43,847
More and more members of security squad

271
00:15:43,847 --> 00:15:45,347
are gathering at the residence!

272
00:15:45,347 --> 00:15:48,447
Will Thief Kid really appear as promised

273
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,929
amidst all this tight security?

274
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:52,547
He'll come!

275
00:15:52,547 --> 00:15:55,747
He'll come without fail!

276
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:59,847
Wearing that hateful dauntless grin on his face.

277
00:15:59,847 --> 00:16:01,447
Listen, all of you!

278
00:16:01,447 --> 00:16:02,941
Let's catch the thief today

279
00:16:03,147 --> 00:16:06,747
and turn his snobbish face into one of dupe!

280
00:16:10,547 --> 00:16:13,747
Making a big fuss over an imposter.

281
00:16:13,747 --> 00:16:15,647
He's the real one!

282
00:16:15,647 --> 00:16:21,447
It's true that his first letter smelled fishy,

283
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,647
but it was all just

284
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:25,547
some fancy joke of his to make fun of we, the police.

285
00:16:25,547 --> 00:16:30,969
But this letter of challenge that was found inside the safe

286
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:33,247
is undoubtedly what he put there!

287
00:16:33,247 --> 00:16:36,975
So, now, you calling him the imposter is the queer!

288
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:39,447
Well, even if it were to be so...

289
00:16:39,447 --> 00:16:42,981
I don't see the need for all this tight security.

290
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:44,047
Have you forgotten?

291
00:16:44,047 --> 00:16:47,547
What he's after is the great impregnable safe made by

292
00:16:47,547 --> 00:16:52,991
the legendary genius of tricky gadgets, Kichiemon Samizu!

293
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:56,995
His ultimate goal is to open the door of Iron Badger!

294
00:16:56,995 --> 00:17:00,999
It's loaded with gadgets to get rid of impudent ones

295
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:03,347
who dare try breaking into it.

296
00:17:03,347 --> 00:17:05,003
It's so well made, that even I,

297
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:07,647
the only one who knows how to open it,

298
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:10,547
at times, make mistakes and almost lose my life.

299
00:17:10,547 --> 00:17:13,011
There's no one that could possibly open it!

300
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:15,013
But, you're coping with the magician under the moon,

301
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:16,647
Thief Kid, you know!

302
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:18,047
No matter what kind of safe it may be,

303
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:19,947
if it falls into his hands, he'll open it in the wink of an eye.

304
00:17:19,947 --> 00:17:22,347
Even if he did have such a talent,

305
00:17:22,347 --> 00:17:24,447
he would never be able to get close to it!

306
00:17:24,447 --> 00:17:28,247
I showed you the security device in this room, didn't I?

307
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:31,647
Once he sets foot into this room, that's it.

308
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:34,747
The weight sensor that's embedded in the floor will go off

309
00:17:34,747 --> 00:17:37,347
and he'll be surrounded by iron bars in an instant

310
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,647
and nothing more than rat in a trap!

311
00:17:40,647 --> 00:17:42,047
But,

312
00:17:42,047 --> 00:17:47,047
Thief Kid actually put the letter of challenge in this room, didn't he?

313
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:51,847
He already had something worked out to bypass the device here!

314
00:17:51,847 --> 00:17:56,847
Which means, when Thief Kid put that letter of challenge there,

315
00:17:56,847 --> 00:18:00,247
he was near us, right?

316
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:03,647
Because when the door of this room was opened the first time,

317
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,447
nothing was here,

318
00:18:05,447 --> 00:18:08,847
but it was there the next time the door was opened, right?

319
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:13,071
All during that time, we were near this room.

320
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:15,547
If something is placed on the floor

321
00:18:15,547 --> 00:18:18,247
when the switch of the weight sensor is turned off,

322
00:18:18,247 --> 00:18:20,747
it doesn't respond even after the sensor is later turned on?

323
00:18:20,747 --> 00:18:25,083
Right, because it only responds to weight that is detected

324
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,347
after the device is switched on.

325
00:18:27,347 --> 00:18:31,089
Which means it was placed there after the switch was turned off.

326
00:18:31,247 --> 00:18:32,347
Come to think of it,

327
00:18:32,347 --> 00:18:34,747
Uncle, you turned the switch off back then, didn't you?

328
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:38,847
Yes, when you showed us how the weight sensor worked,

329
00:18:38,847 --> 00:18:41,947
by throwing a cigarette inside the room...

330
00:18:43,447 --> 00:18:45,547
What's this sound?

331
00:18:45,547 --> 00:18:47,547
Well, just wait and see!

332
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:58,447
In order to retrieve the cigarette, you turned off the switch.

333
00:18:58,447 --> 00:18:59,547
Akitsu!

334
00:18:59,547 --> 00:19:03,147
Pick up the cigarette that's on the floor and get rid of it!

335
00:19:03,147 --> 00:19:04,747
But...

336
00:19:04,747 --> 00:19:09,127
If I go inside, won't the bars come down on me like just now?

337
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:11,647
You fool! It's switched off!

338
00:19:11,647 --> 00:19:13,947
Just hurry and clean it up now, will you?

339
00:19:13,947 --> 00:19:15,147
Oh, yes, sir!

340
00:19:16,147 --> 00:19:17,647
Gosh.

341
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:20,347
I tell you, he's a new one I just hired the other day, but...

342
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:22,347
he sure is useless.

343
00:19:28,747 --> 00:19:30,947
That man called Akitsu went inside the room

344
00:19:30,947 --> 00:19:32,147
and picked the cigarette up!

345
00:19:32,147 --> 00:19:34,547
So, that guy was the Kid!

346
00:19:34,547 --> 00:19:36,147
He pretended to pick up the cigarette

347
00:19:36,147 --> 00:19:39,157
and audaciously placed the letter of challenge inside!

348
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:40,347
But, I don't think that

349
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:43,161
Mr. Akitsu's the only one who could've put it there.

350
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:45,447
The bodyguard who was constantly standing next to

351
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:46,847
old man Jirokichi could too.

352
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:48,447
He could've put it in the room,

353
00:19:48,447 --> 00:19:50,147
just as old man Jirokichi was about to close the door.

354
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:53,171
And, the maid who said that she just came here today,

355
00:19:53,347 --> 00:19:54,947
could've done it too.

356
00:19:54,947 --> 00:19:59,177
She did say that she was on all fours looking around for the dog.

357
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:01,647
But, she wasn't near the door

358
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:04,247
when the switch was turned off, was she?

359
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:05,747
Nope!

360
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:09,947
She wasn't by the door that we were shown the security device!

361
00:20:09,947 --> 00:20:12,647
But, in this room where the safe is...

362
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:17,747
See, there's another door!

363
00:20:17,747 --> 00:20:19,947
If the maid were the Kid,

364
00:20:19,947 --> 00:20:22,047
she could pretend to be looking for the dog

365
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:24,347
and slide the letter under the door

366
00:20:24,347 --> 00:20:27,205
when the guards were off their guard.

367
00:20:27,447 --> 00:20:29,207
Right.

368
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:32,347
Back then, Uncle was giving orders in a loud voice so...

369
00:20:32,347 --> 00:20:34,847
She could've heard him.

370
00:20:34,847 --> 00:20:36,047
I see.

371
00:20:36,047 --> 00:20:38,447
Which means she could've known that the switch was turned off

372
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:40,947
even if she were over there.

373
00:20:40,947 --> 00:20:42,347
Besides, all three of them

374
00:20:42,347 --> 00:20:45,223
seems to have been hired only recently too.

375
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:48,447
In other words, it's very likely that

376
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:51,229
Kid snuck into this house in disguise.

377
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:55,947
Okay! Bring that guy called Akitsu and the maid over here!

378
00:20:55,947 --> 00:20:58,847
I'll pull on their faces with all my might

379
00:20:58,847 --> 00:21:02,547
and confirm whether it's a disguise or not!

380
00:21:02,547 --> 00:21:04,847
Okay, first for...

381
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,245
Mr. Bodyguard, you.

382
00:21:07,447 --> 00:21:08,847
No!

383
00:21:09,947 --> 00:21:11,547
All the people that I hire,

384
00:21:11,547 --> 00:21:14,647
are from that point on, a member of my family!

385
00:21:14,647 --> 00:21:15,847
Be it the police or not,

386
00:21:15,847 --> 00:21:17,947
I will not have you pushing your weight around!

387
00:21:17,947 --> 00:21:20,047
Oh, no. But...

388
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:25,547
If you insist, show me proof that he's Thief Kid!

389
00:21:25,547 --> 00:21:28,647
At any rate, I'm going to have a meal in my study!

390
00:21:28,647 --> 00:21:30,947
Don't you dare make too much of a fuss!

391
00:21:33,947 --> 00:21:35,047
Darn it!

392
00:21:35,047 --> 00:21:37,847
Everything could be made clear only if I get to pull at their faces.

393
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:41,047
Uncle is sort of acting strange.

394
00:21:41,047 --> 00:21:43,281
Because he would usually be all out to get, saying,

395
00:21:43,281 --> 00:21:48,547
"I'll teach that sneaky thief a lesson!"

396
00:21:48,547 --> 00:21:50,147
But, today, he's saying things like,

397
00:21:50,147 --> 00:21:51,847
"Let him be because he's an imposter",

398
00:21:51,847 --> 00:21:54,547
"Don't investigate because there's no proof".

399
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:58,847
Maybe Uncle is dear Thief Kid!

400
00:21:58,847 --> 00:22:00,747
No way.

401
00:22:00,747 --> 00:22:03,747
It sure is strange.

402
00:22:03,747 --> 00:22:05,947
After all, he did receive a letter of challenge from Kid

403
00:22:05,947 --> 00:22:09,307
saying that he may be coming.

404
00:22:09,547 --> 00:22:10,947
And yet, he hired new people to work for him.

405
00:22:10,947 --> 00:22:13,311
And, three all together too, at a time like this?

406
00:22:13,547 --> 00:22:16,247
Thief Kid's action of sending out that letter of challenge

407
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:18,547
is incomprehensible to begin with too.

408
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:21,319
Even if the first old-fashioned letter that arrived was,

409
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:24,847
something to make fun of the police.

410
00:22:24,847 --> 00:22:26,847
Why would he send a new letter of challenge,

411
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:28,447
in the form he usually does,

412
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:31,329
on the very day that he's coming to do his thing?

413
00:22:31,329 --> 00:22:32,747
Something's fishy.

414
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:39,337
There's definitely something behind this case.

415
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,420
Next Conan's Hint:

416
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,802
"Jirokichi Suzuki"

417
00:24:05,802 --> 00:24:07,694
My dear Thief Kid.

418
00:24:07,694 --> 00:24:09,434
That man is the hint.

419
00:24:09,434 --> 00:24:10,780
Dear Thief Kid.
