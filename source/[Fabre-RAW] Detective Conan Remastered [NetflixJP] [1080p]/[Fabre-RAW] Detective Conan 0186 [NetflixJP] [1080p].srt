1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,840
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,540
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,240
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,140
The case where a detective is the victim.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,240
Shinichi solves the case sharply.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,640
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,890
We come to this villa on an overnight trip

10
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,090
and meet Kazuyoshi Sunaoka

11
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,790
who plays a famous detective

12
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,490
in the popular TV series "Urban Hunter"

13
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,290
and other staff members working on the series.

14
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,790
But behind the scenes of the show,

15
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,290
relations between these people are very hostile.

16
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,790
The window in Kazu's room...

17
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,990
And then with a single gunshot,

18
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,190
Mr. Sunaoka is killed by an unknown assailant!

19
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,890
After firing from the rocks across the valley,

20
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,890
the killer climbed down the rope

21
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,490
and used a boat to escape,

22
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,590
that's what was believed.

23
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,190
It takes 30 minutes to get to the other side,

24
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,490
so no one from the villa

25
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,090
could have possibly committed the crime.

26
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:50,290
But the killer is one of those three.

27
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,290
I know I'm right.

28
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:04,690
"Murder of the Famous Detective (Part 2)"

29
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,890
Yes, Mr. Sunaoka's killer...

30
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,990
I believe he went down to the stream and escaped.

31
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,390
I've just issued an all points bulletin and we are searching,

32
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,090
but I must ask all of you once more

33
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,490
to go over the details of what happened.

34
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,490
In the morning,

35
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:29,090
I was in Mr. Tahara's room going over the scenarios.

36
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,390
Then in the afternoon,

37
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,190
I went to the hunting in the woods with Mr. Sunaoka.

38
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,490
We got back at about 6:30 pm,

39
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,890
then joined everyone for dinner right after that.

40
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,490
After talking with Mr. Nagatsuka,

41
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,890
I stayed in my room until the evening writing.

42
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,890
Mr. Sunaoka called me to his room in the morning

43
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,790
and he told me about switching agencies,

44
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,690
we had a little argument.

45
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,990
I see. An argument, you say?

46
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,790
Yes.

47
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,090
I was on the archery grounds in the afternoon.

48
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,490
I ran into Mr. Mouri and his family there.

49
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,390
I got back here after 6 pm

50
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,790
then joined the others.

51
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,990
Me? I was busy working, of course.

52
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,690
I'm alone today so I was very busy,

53
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,190
I don't remember all the details though.

54
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,690
Come on. It's your bedtime, Conan.

55
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,290
But I want to listen a little more.

56
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,990
No! Dad will scold you again.

57
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,390
I know, but it's too early for bed.

58
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,190
I'm sure dad will be at it all night.

59
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,090
You'd better not get in his way so just go to sleep.

60
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,390
All right. I'll go to sleep so you can go now.

61
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,990
No way. I'm staying right here until you're asleep.

62
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,490
All right then, now for after dinner.

63
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,490
It was about 7:50 pm when Mr. Sunaoka

64
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,190
left the restaurant with Ms. Tanigawa.

65
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,590
Right after that,

66
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,590
Mr. Tahara went to the kitchen to get more drinks.

67
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,190
At 8 pm sharp, Mr. Nagatsuka got a call from the station

68
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,790
and went to the front desk.

69
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,990
And right after that, I got a call from Mr. Sunaoka.

70
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,190
He abruptly ended conversation

71
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,190
and that's when we heard the gunshot.

72
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,890
Ms. Tanigawa, who had been taking a shower came out to the veranda

73
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:21,690
and discovered the bullet hole in Mr. Sunaoka's window.

74
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,790
We went to get Mr. Akashi at the front desk

75
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,490
and got the master key to unlock the door.

76
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,490
At 8:05 pm, we discovered the body.

77
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:38,090
Which means Mr. Sunaoka was killed between 8 pm to 8:05 pm.

78
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,990
Conan?

79
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,690
He fell asleep unusually fast tonight.

80
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,590
Goodnight.

81
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,490
I thought she'd never leave.

82
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,190
I'd like to go over in more detail

83
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,890
what you were all doing before and after the murder.

84
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,190
Why bother? You know it was somebody from the outside, don't you?

85
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:27,690
Well, we still must clarify what the victim was doing.

86
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,190
Mr. Sunaoka was alone in his room locked from the inside.

87
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,690
How would we know what he was doing?

88
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,890
Yes. Well, that's true.

89
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,390
We don't even have time to mourn him!

90
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,290
Give us a break!

91
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,290
Excuse me for saying this,

92
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,690
but it seems you three had some bad feelings toward Mr. Sunaoka.

93
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,390
-What? -What was that?

94
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,990
Are you implying one of us killed him?

95
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,590
Not really. This is all part of the investigation.

96
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,090
Mr. Sunaoka seemed very picky about the scenarios.

97
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,390
Isn't that right, Mr. Tahara?

98
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,490
Lately, it seems the viewers solve the crime before I do.

99
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,390
That just won't do.

100
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,490
Mr. Sunaoka, put yourself in my shoes.

101
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,890
I have to write scenarios to fit your personality.

102
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,190
I was only being honest.

103
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,890
And as for you, Mr. Nagatsuka, the producer.

104
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,790
I know all about it.

105
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,590
I hear you're pocketing some of the production fees.

106
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,790
How dare you! That's a lie!

107
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,090
It... it really was a lie.

108
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,690
Well, an investigation will clear that up.

109
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,890
Of course, do what you wish.

110
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,890
Now for Ms. Tanigawa,

111
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,690
Mr. Sunaoka talked about switching agencies, didn't he?

112
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,590
I'm the biggest star your agency's got.

113
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,490
If you lose me, you probably won't be able to stay in the business.

114
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,090
Well, Mr. Detective, I'll catch you again later.

115
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,990
On top of that, you're the only one

116
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,290
without a witness to verify your alibi.

117
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,390
How can you say that?

118
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,690
You all saw me in my room

119
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,190
from the garden restaurant, didn't you?

120
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:12,290
Yes, but it was after the gunshot.

121
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,690
Another thing, the rest of you

122
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:19,390
also had an opportunity to contact the shooter.

123
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,190
This is crazy!

124
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,690
But then you can never tell about Ms. Tanigawa.

125
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,190
What do you mean by that?

126
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,890
Didn't lover boy dump you?

127
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,890
Mr. Nagatsuka! Don't be ridiculous!

128
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,790
Now now, everybody, just calm down!

129
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,890
Detective Yokomizo!

130
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,990
The findings regarding the rifle are back.

131
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,490
The rifle was

132
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,390
one of those kept in the hunting management office.

133
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,290
The rope also came from there.

134
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:54,490
The markings on the bullet taken from the victim and the ones from the rifle were a perfect match.

135
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,890
What is this?

136
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,090
A hole was opened in bottom of the bullet and the tip's been sharpened.

137
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,490
What was the purpose for this?

138
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,690
It certainly doesn't make sense, does it?

139
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,290
There's spiral grooves inside the hole.

140
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,590
It's like a screw.

141
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,790
Conan!

142
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,390
Hey, you! You're supposed to be sleeping!

143
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:23,090
I got up because I was so thirsty.

144
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,090
All right already. Go get some water and then go back to bed.

145
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,790
Okay.

146
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,990
I almost forgot.

147
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,790
-Hey, Pops. -What? What is it now?

148
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,090
What did Mr. Sunaoka say on the telephone?

149
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,990
That is none of your business

150
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,790
But those were the last words

151
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,790
of Mr. Sunaoka, the big star, weren't they?

152
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:47,590
Oh, so you're one of those low brows?

153
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:52,190
He asked me to come to his room to talk detective talk.

154
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,690
But then he said, "Hey, what's that?"

155
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,590
and seemed surprised and hung up.

156
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,490
I knew it.

157
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:04,890
Since the rifle markings match,

158
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,190
then what I found mixed in with the pieces of glass...

159
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,490
Where'd they come from?

160
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,690
Which one?

161
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,290
It's so heavy!

162
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,190
I knew it! Just as I thought!

163
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,990
Now I know how the trick was worked.

164
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,890
What's this mark on the floor?

165
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,090
I concentrated so hard on the pieces of glass,

166
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,890
I didn't notice it before.

167
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,490
Could it be...

168
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,690
I knew it.

169
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:52,690
Which means the real weapon should be behind this door.

170
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:56,690
And the person staying in that room...

171
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,290
is also the killer.

172
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,870
The rifle markings matched.

173
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,770
You don't need us here anymore, do you?

174
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,070
Excuse me, officer.

175
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,970
What is it, kid?

176
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,170
I have something to tell you.

177
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,270
Huh? Room 304?

178
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,370
Detective Yokomizo said to do a secret search.

179
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,470
Here's the master key.

180
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,070
-Hurry, okay? -Sure.

181
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,470
Then, we'll be going back to our rooms now.

182
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,670
All right.

183
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,470
Shall we continue this at 8 tomorrow morning then?

184
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,970
What? That's so early!

185
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,470
But I guess it's okay.

186
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,070
Thank you for your time.

187
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,470
Mr. Mouri, why don't you get some rest?

188
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,470
We're going to go join the search downstream, excuse us.

189
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,270
Good luck.

190
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,570
Wait a minute!

191
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,270
You three over there.

192
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,670
Detective Yokomizo, hear me out first.

193
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,370
That's the pose! So it's hit you, didn't it?

194
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,570
Yes, it finally hit me.

195
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:29,070
But it doesn't seem like a job for Sleeping Kogoro this time.

196
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,170
You're wrong about that.

197
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:36,070
After all, the killer is one of those three.

198
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,470
What?

199
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,770
What is that mean?

200
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,670
I understand, Mr. Mouri.

201
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,970
All right, you three.

202
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,170
Why don't you have a seat on the sofa once more?

203
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:51,470
At the first, it appeared to be an obvious case

204
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,270
where the murderer was someone from the outside.

205
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:59,270
But why did the murderer leave the rifle behind?

206
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,270
The murderer could have tossed it into the stream

207
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:04,170
or hidden it in the woods.

208
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,470
Another thing, both the rifle and the rope

209
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,870
the murderer used to get down to the stream,

210
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,770
why were these things wet by the rain?

211
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:17,070
Right! It rained in the evening!

212
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:21,170
If the rifle was left about 8 pm, it is strange that it would be wet.

213
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,370
The reason for that is, both the rifle and rope

214
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:29,470
were planted there before the rain.

215
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:34,670
In fact, it was dry under some parts of the rifle.

216
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,070
That proves the rifle was left there

217
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,870
before it rained in the evening.

218
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:46,070
Which means the rifle was what actually the murder weapon.

219
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,470
But the markings matched, didn't they?

220
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,770
Before I explain that,

221
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:55,870
why do you suppose the murderer went through all that trouble?

222
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:01,370
Making it appear like he was shot from across valley.

223
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,270
Even if the murderer was an outsider,

224
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,370
all the murderer had to do was

225
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,870
prove he or she never came close to the villa.

226
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:15,570
There was absolutely no reason to plant fake evidence.

227
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:20,470
The murderer is someone who needed an alibi.

228
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,470
That's why the scene had to be across the valley.

229
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,470
That's right, the murderer is one of you three.

230
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,470
What?

231
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,770
Hold on a minute.

232
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,870
We're not magicians,

233
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,770
how did we shoot him without using the rifle?

234
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:42,870
That's right! You haven't been making any sense at all!

235
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,870
And now, I'll go into the details

236
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,770
of how Mr. Sunaoka was actually killed.

237
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,870
This is ridiculous.

238
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,170
First, the killer takes the master key

239
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,170
from the front desk when no one is around

240
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:59,170
and sneaks into Mr. Sunaoka's room on the 3rd floor.

241
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,070
Then props up the mattress against the window.

242
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,570
Mattress?

243
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,470
What's a mattress got to do with anything?

244
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,770
The killer then went to the hunting ground management office

245
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:13,270
and stole the rifle and rope.

246
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,970
Then, the killer went to the rocky area across the valley

247
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,970
and shot at the window in Mr. Sunaoka's room.

248
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,970
The killer then left the rifle there

249
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,370
and tied the rope to the tree

250
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,770
and made it look like the escape was by water.

251
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,770
The killer then snuck back into Mr. Sunaoka's room

252
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:37,270
and removed the bullet shot into the mattress.

253
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,770
After replacing the mattress,

254
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,170
the killer removed all the broken pieces of glass

255
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,870
and hid the hole by drawing the curtains.

256
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,470
Detective Yokomizo.

257
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,470
The bullet removed from the body

258
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:52,070
had some work done to it, didn't it?

259
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,170
Yes.

260
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,370
The killer went back to his or her own room

261
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,170
and dug a hole into the end of the bullet

262
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,670
which the killer took out of the mattress.

263
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,370
Tools were used to drill the screw threads

264
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:05,170
and the tip was sharpened with a file.

265
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,270
Then something the killer had prepared earlier

266
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,270
was screwed into the bullet.

267
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,270
And now we have a new deadly weapon

268
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,670
with the same markings as the rifle.

269
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,770
After the preparations had been made,

270
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,370
the killer went to the garden restaurant for dinner.

271
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,570
When Mr. Sunaoka went back to his room,

272
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:30,870
the killer made up some sort of excuse and got into his room.

273
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,170
And pierced Mr. Sunaoka...

274
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,270
in the forehead, from the front.

275
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,670
Pierced?

276
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:41,570
Are you saying the weapon was a knife or arrow?

277
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,870
An arrow?

278
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,270
After killing Mr. Sunaoka,

279
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,370
the killer moved the body

280
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,370
to make it look like the shot came from the window

281
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,770
and opened the curtains.

282
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,670
Then rescattered the pieces of glass around

283
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:59,170
and removed the tip of the arrow from Mr. Sunaoka's forehead.

284
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,770
Then left without a shag.

285
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,770
Nice, Mr. Mouri.

286
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:13,570
You should become a scenario writer.

287
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,670
That was a brilliant story.

288
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:19,670
No, I don't have the talent to become a writer.

289
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,370
All the evidence the killer left behind

290
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,270
showed me the truth.

291
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,370
I'm just the messenger.

292
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,570
For instance, along with the pieces of glass from the window,

293
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,270
I found some coconut fibers.

294
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,270
They were from the mattress.

295
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,770
It probably fell out when the bullet was dug out.

296
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,270
The killer didn't notice them

297
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:45,270
and gathered them up along with the glass.

298
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,870
I see.

299
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:50,470
After that, the killer hid the real weapon

300
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,170
and then went to another location so as not to under suspicion

301
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:56,970
and called me on my cellular.

302
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,270
The killer probably saw the number

303
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,870
on the business card I handed out during dinner.

304
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:07,570
Mr. Mouri, you yourself said the caller was Mr. Sunaoka.

305
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,670
On the phone, Mr. Sunaoka said,

306
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,770
"How about it? Why don't you come up to my room

307
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,870
and we'll talk detective?"

308
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,370
Then, "Huh? Hold on for a second. What is that?"

309
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,970
Well, people...

310
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,170
Does that sound familiar to anyone?

311
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:27,370
That's the dialogue he said on tonight's show!

312
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,670
-Are you sure? -Yes, I'm positive!

313
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,570
I taped it. Why don't you see for yourself?

314
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,770
Yes, I'll do that.

315
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:41,770
It was the opening scene, but please fast forward it.

316
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,770
That's it!

317
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,070
How about it? Why don't you come up to my room

318
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,070
and we'll talk detective?

319
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,670
Huh? Hold on for a second. What is that?

320
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:58,470
I see. The killer recorded this line previously

321
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,570
and played it back to Mr. Mouri on the phone, right?

322
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:05,170
Then Mr. Sunaoka was already dead when the call was made?

323
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,870
Yes, he was already killed.

324
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,970
The only one without an alibi for that time is...

325
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,970
Detective Yokomizo!

326
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,770
As you ordered, I searched room 304

327
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,070
and look at what I found!

328
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,870
That's a bowgun.

329
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,070
And I found an arrow with blood on it.

330
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,570
So this is the murder weapon!

331
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,570
And there are screw threads on the arrow head.

332
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:30,570
Mr. Mouri! It's exactly like you said!

333
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,470
I'm sure the killer intended to take them home and destroy them.

334
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:39,170
Officer, did you just say room #304?

335
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,170
You mean...

336
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:45,670
That's right. The killer was staying in room 304,

337
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,570
Toshiaki Tahara, it's you!

338
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,370
-What? -I don't believe it!

339
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:56,870
Mr. Tahara, a little past 7:50 pm,

340
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,970
you left the restaurant saying you were going to get more drinks

341
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:03,070
but you went to Mr. Sunaoka's room and killed him.

342
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:07,270
About 8 pm, you came back looking as if nothing happened.

343
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,370
You deliberately sat far away

344
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,270
so you call me without being seen

345
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,570
then you threw something, possibly a firecracker into the valley

346
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:17,570
to make us think a shot was fired.

347
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,870
Some detective you are!

348
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,670
Just because the murder weapon was in my room

349
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:30,070
doesn't mean it belongs to me.

350
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:33,570
I'm being set up by the real killer!

351
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:37,870
Unfortunately for you, I have more proof.

352
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,070
What was that?

353
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,270
It's your shoes.

354
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:46,070
At the crime scene, there was a mark...

355
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,570
left by your shoes.

356
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:52,370
Excuse me, would you mind taking your shoes off?

357
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:55,870
There's pieces of glass stuck in the sole.

358
00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:00,670
Could they be from the pieces scattered around the body?

359
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:05,270
I'm sure no one else besides us went near the body.

360
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:10,870
So how could be these pieces of glass get under your shoes?

361
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,170
You were so preoccupied with what you had to do,

362
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,970
you didn't realize you had stepped on them.

363
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,470
You were too caught up.

364
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,270
You win.

365
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,770
Mr. Tahara! Why did you do such a thing?

366
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:29,970
He was also criticizing and making fun of the scenarios I wrote.

367
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,570
If the ratings were bad, he blamed me.

368
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:36,170
I couldn't forgive that Sunaoka for that!

369
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,870
I wanted to show everyone, the producers,

370
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,570
the actors and the police...

371
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,670
Yes, and I even the most famous detective

372
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:47,670
that I could commit the perfect crime.

373
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:51,870
And the victim, of course Bannai Kujirao Sunaoka

374
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,870
was the only choice.

375
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,370
How about the lead in our next series?

376
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,470
The title is "Kogoro, the Famous Detective"!

377
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,570
Will you do it?

378
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,170
The ratings are guaranteed to be high,

379
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,770
you'll be a famous star in no time!

380
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:39,470
That does sound good.

381
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,970
-Let's get going! -What?

382
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,770
Mr. Mouri!

383
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,470
Ran, we'll want you too!

384
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:55,870
Mr. Mouri!

385
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:58,570
I want a chance to be a star!

386
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,380
Next Conan's Hint:

387
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,440
"Black tea"
