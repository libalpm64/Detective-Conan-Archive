1
00:00:22,163 --> 00:00:23,963
Today's date turns into an investigation.

2
00:00:23,963 --> 00:00:25,863
Search for the culprit for each of their own reasons.

3
00:00:25,863 --> 00:00:27,963
Will the case as well as the feelings of the two be settled?

4
00:00:27,963 --> 00:00:29,563
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:31,263
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,263 --> 00:00:33,363
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:57,275 --> 00:01:59,475
Officer Takagi and Officer Sato

8
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:01,575
came to Tropical Marine Land on a secret date

9
00:02:01,575 --> 00:02:03,375
without telling their colleagues at the station.

10
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:07,175
However, not only did they end up being watched

11
00:02:07,175 --> 00:02:08,975
by Inspector Shiratori and the other officers,

12
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:13,175
we were sent to interrupt their date.

13
00:02:15,075 --> 00:02:17,075
Then, instead of a ring

14
00:02:17,075 --> 00:02:18,475
that he was planning to give as a present,

15
00:02:18,475 --> 00:02:21,875
a paper bag of heroin was found in Officer Takagi's bag.

16
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:25,275
Here.

17
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:26,475
That's right.

18
00:02:26,475 --> 00:02:29,875
When I rode the "50,000 Miles Under The Sea" attraction,

19
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,075
I'm sure someone made a mistake back then

20
00:02:32,075 --> 00:02:33,775
and took my bag.

21
00:02:33,775 --> 00:02:36,175
You've got a clue!

22
00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:38,475
Look at the shoulder belt of that bag.

23
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:41,875
Only the hole on the left side is spread out wide.

24
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:45,075
A right-handed person would normally carry it on the right shoulder,

25
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:48,875
but the owner of that bag always carried it on his left shoulder.

26
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,775
Which means

27
00:02:50,775 --> 00:02:53,275
the possibility of him being left-handed is very high.

28
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:55,775
"Genta Kojima"

29
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:56,775
Here it is.

30
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,975
This person is left-handed!

31
00:02:59,975 --> 00:03:01,875
How do you know?

32
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:02,875
The characters written using the ballpoint pen

33
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,475
smeared to the right.

34
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,275
This is proof that the person is left-handed.

35
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,875
Please announce his name that's on the survey sheet

36
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,775
and have him come here immediately!

37
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:13,075
He's a major witness for an investigation!

38
00:03:16,675 --> 00:03:22,375
"Love Story at Police Headquarters #5 (Part 2)"

39
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,075
"300 fireworks show at 7 pm!"

40
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,375
"Tropical Marine Land, Gate C"

41
00:03:36,975 --> 00:03:39,875
Mr. Noboru Takagi, please come immediately to the front

42
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,775
of the entrance of the attraction "50,000 Miles Under The Sea".

43
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,175
Takagi?

44
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:49,975
I see, Takagi has already gathered all his relatives here.

45
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:52,775
Inspector, the two are probably going to

46
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:54,275
have their reception wedding here today.

47
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,475
It'll be okay.

48
00:03:55,475 --> 00:03:57,875
Without a ring, they cannot proceed with the ceremony.

49
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:01,275
But if you find anyone with a similar kind of bag,

50
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:03,375
question them at all cost

51
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,475
and check inside their bag.

52
00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:07,275
Show it to me.

53
00:04:07,275 --> 00:04:08,975
Hurry.

54
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:10,975
Attention, all customers.

55
00:04:10,975 --> 00:04:13,775
Mr. Noboru Takagi from Chiba Prefecture...

56
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:18,375
please come immediately to the front entrance

57
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,675
of our "50,000 Miles Under the Sea" attraction.

58
00:04:21,675 --> 00:04:23,975
It's him! He's the one!

59
00:04:23,975 --> 00:04:26,475
The man that was doing the golf swing!

60
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,175
Are you Mr. Noboru Takagi?

61
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:32,875
The police?

62
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,575
Yes, I am Takagi.

63
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:36,975
What do you want from me?

64
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:39,775
You're left-handed, aren't you?

65
00:04:39,775 --> 00:04:41,075
Yes.

66
00:04:41,075 --> 00:04:42,075
I'd hate to trouble you,

67
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:43,975
but will you show me your bag?

68
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:47,775
My... my bag? But this is all I have.

69
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,475
Oh, no.

70
00:04:50,475 --> 00:04:52,875
It's totally different from Officer Takagi's bag.

71
00:04:54,075 --> 00:04:57,675
Hey, daddy. I'm hungry!

72
00:04:57,675 --> 00:05:00,175
-Come on! -Okay, okay.

73
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,275
What? He is...

74
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:04,575
the child that's in the picture.

75
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,375
Geez, you called me out here,

76
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,875
and this is what you had to say?

77
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,575
I... I'm so sorry!

78
00:05:10,575 --> 00:05:12,875
Thank you for your cooperation!

79
00:05:16,675 --> 00:05:20,275
There's just no way a mule would bring a child.

80
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:23,475
But it's one down, so just three more to go.

81
00:05:23,475 --> 00:05:25,475
If we check the survey sheets,

82
00:05:25,475 --> 00:05:26,775
we can get their names and addresses.

83
00:05:26,775 --> 00:05:28,375
That won't work.

84
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,575
The survey sheets taken after that man's

85
00:05:30,575 --> 00:05:33,575
are those of three students on a school trip.

86
00:05:33,575 --> 00:05:36,275
In other words, the three people in between

87
00:05:36,275 --> 00:05:38,575
didn't answer the survey sheets.

88
00:05:38,575 --> 00:05:40,075
Oh, no.

89
00:05:40,075 --> 00:05:42,775
If only we could at least find those students,

90
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:45,175
we could ask them what kind of bag

91
00:05:45,175 --> 00:05:46,775
the three suspects were holding.

92
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:49,375
The male students on a school trip

93
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,375
were around there some place a while ago.

94
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,275
See, over there!

95
00:05:59,575 --> 00:06:04,175
They're the DC Academy's famous trio!

96
00:06:04,175 --> 00:06:05,375
Treerrios?

97
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:08,775
Not Treerrios, but trio.

98
00:06:08,775 --> 00:06:12,275
All three of them are famous for being sportsmen.

99
00:06:13,475 --> 00:06:17,975
Hey, there was a soiled handkerchief in the bag, wasn't there?

100
00:06:17,975 --> 00:06:18,975
Oh, yes.

101
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:21,575
Do you mean this?

102
00:06:22,575 --> 00:06:24,375
The color and smell of this stain...

103
00:06:25,675 --> 00:06:27,275
Just as I thought.

104
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:30,675
Okay, I'll go ask the three then!

105
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:32,575
No, you don't have to.

106
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:34,875
There's something I just remembered.

107
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:38,875
A taboo that a sportsman should never do.

108
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:42,075
A taboo that a sportsman should never do?

109
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:45,375
Is that going to specify the owner of this bag?

110
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,375
What's a taboo?

111
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:52,175
That's something that you're not supposed to do.

112
00:06:53,675 --> 00:06:56,775
See, just watch those three very carefully.

113
00:06:57,675 --> 00:07:01,175
All three of them are famous high school sportsmen.

114
00:07:01,175 --> 00:07:03,075
On the right end is Yosuke Goto,

115
00:07:03,075 --> 00:07:04,775
a high school baseball player who has won his way up to rank 4

116
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:06,575
as the best left-handed player.

117
00:07:06,575 --> 00:07:09,775
In the middle is Keita Nakajima, the backstroker

118
00:07:09,775 --> 00:07:11,375
who broke the inter-high record.

119
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,675
And at the very left is Kazuhiko Maeda,

120
00:07:14,675 --> 00:07:16,175
a soccer player under seventeen.

121
00:07:17,275 --> 00:07:18,875
Don't you notice something?

122
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,175
The owner of the bag is a left-hander

123
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:26,275
who always carries his bag over his left shoulder.

124
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:28,575
Who among the baseball player, soccer player, and swimmer

125
00:07:28,575 --> 00:07:30,775
is the person we're looking for?

126
00:07:30,775 --> 00:07:32,575
It's the one who plays soccer then,

127
00:07:32,575 --> 00:07:35,475
because he's carrying his bag on his left shoulder.

128
00:07:35,475 --> 00:07:38,875
That's because he happens to be left-handed.

129
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,575
How is that so?

130
00:07:40,575 --> 00:07:43,375
What about the swimmer?

131
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:46,275
We've got to ask whether she's right-handed or not

132
00:07:46,275 --> 00:07:48,575
or we'll never know.

133
00:07:48,575 --> 00:07:50,875
I get it. Maybe it's the baseball player?

134
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,675
A left-handed player means he's left-handed, doesn't it?

135
00:07:53,675 --> 00:07:55,575
Then, it's the baseball player.

136
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,375
That's only a coincidence, I think.

137
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:00,675
But something seems strange.

138
00:08:00,675 --> 00:08:02,875
Look, the baseball player

139
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,875
is carrying the bag on his right shoulder.

140
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,575
True. Why? Why?

141
00:08:07,575 --> 00:08:09,675
Maybe he used to throw with his right arm

142
00:08:09,675 --> 00:08:11,475
before he switched to using his left arm.

143
00:08:11,475 --> 00:08:14,275
That's why he's probably actually right-handed.

144
00:08:14,275 --> 00:08:16,675
No, you're wrong.

145
00:08:16,675 --> 00:08:18,875
That is not the reason why he's not carrying the bag

146
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,575
on his right shoulder.

147
00:08:20,575 --> 00:08:22,975
He's not supposed to carry it over his left shoulder.

148
00:08:22,975 --> 00:08:26,475
That's one of the taboos a sportsman is not supposed to do.

149
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:35,175
That is, he has to protect his precious left shoulder.

150
00:08:35,175 --> 00:08:37,675
Now that you mentioned it, I've heard something like that before.

151
00:08:37,675 --> 00:08:40,275
Pitchers try not to burden their shoulders.

152
00:08:40,275 --> 00:08:41,675
So when they carry heavy loads with their shoulder,

153
00:08:41,675 --> 00:08:44,275
they carry it on the shoulder opposite the hand they throw with.

154
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:47,175
Genta, the guy you saw was right-handed, wasn't he?

155
00:08:47,175 --> 00:08:50,875
Yeah, he was throwing in air like this.

156
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,275
I see.

157
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:53,775
If that person is a right-handed pitcher

158
00:08:53,775 --> 00:08:56,675
and is still playing baseball somewhere,

159
00:08:56,675 --> 00:08:57,975
it is very likely that he was carrying the bag

160
00:08:57,975 --> 00:09:00,975
on his left shoulder to protect his right shoulder.

161
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:04,175
As if he were left-handed.

162
00:09:04,175 --> 00:09:07,575
But I wonder if it's safe to base our conclusion on just that.

163
00:09:07,575 --> 00:09:10,975
There are left-handed soccer players and swimmers too.

164
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:12,675
That's not all.

165
00:09:12,675 --> 00:09:14,775
This handkerchief that was in the bag.

166
00:09:14,775 --> 00:09:16,375
Try smelling it.

167
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,675
This is...

168
00:09:23,675 --> 00:09:27,675
Yeah. Mr. Mouri was polishing his glove with it this morning.

169
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:34,775
It's the smell of glove oil.

170
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:37,775
Then the owner of this bag...

171
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:39,675
In other words, the mule is...

172
00:09:39,675 --> 00:09:42,575
The man that wears a cap and plays baseball.

173
00:09:42,575 --> 00:09:44,275
I'm pretty sure.

174
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:48,675
But how do we look for him?

175
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:51,475
It seems like the number of customers has increased too.

176
00:09:58,075 --> 00:10:01,275
I bought it at a nearby shop, but it's not working well.

177
00:10:01,275 --> 00:10:04,275
It's difficult to see too far with opera glasses.

178
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,475
This is Sogawa.

179
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,975
Takagi and Sato are beginning to really move about.

180
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:14,975
They seem to be looking desperately for the bag with the ring inside.

181
00:10:14,975 --> 00:10:16,075
Roger.

182
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:19,075
Let's make sure that we get to it before they do, no matter what.

183
00:10:19,075 --> 00:10:22,475
All officers, please continue questioning.

184
00:10:22,475 --> 00:10:24,575
And please do not lose track

185
00:10:24,575 --> 00:10:26,475
of both Officer Takagi and Officer Sato. Thank you.

186
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:40,175
If he's walking out here somewhere,

187
00:10:40,175 --> 00:10:42,275
we still have a chance of finding him.

188
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:45,275
But if he's inside a pavilion of an attraction or something,

189
00:10:45,275 --> 00:10:47,075
there's no way we can find him.

190
00:10:48,775 --> 00:10:50,075
Don't worry.

191
00:10:50,075 --> 00:10:52,775
Marine Land is only open till 8.00 pm.

192
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:55,775
It's already 5.30 pm. If any deal is going to be carried out,

193
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:57,275
there are only two and a half hours left.

194
00:10:57,275 --> 00:11:00,475
I'm sure he'll avoid an attraction in which he has to wait in line.

195
00:11:00,475 --> 00:11:01,875
Moreover, if he's a mule,

196
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,375
chances are he's here alone.

197
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,075
I'm sure he's having problems trying to kill time.

198
00:11:08,275 --> 00:11:09,875
I can't be all that sure,

199
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,075
but if the mule were to appear,

200
00:11:12,075 --> 00:11:13,275
it would most likely be...

201
00:11:16,975 --> 00:11:19,775
"Retro-Game Pavilion"

202
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,475
He's nowhere in sight.

203
00:11:43,475 --> 00:11:47,175
I did say that I can't be all that sure, you know.

204
00:11:47,175 --> 00:11:50,175
I have to go take a leak.

205
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:51,975
I'm going to the restroom.

206
00:11:51,975 --> 00:11:53,275
Me too!

207
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:56,175
Maybe it's this way.

208
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:57,575
It's the john!

209
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:03,275
Oh. Are you okay?

210
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:09,575
You're the two kids that were at "50,000 Miles Under the Sea".

211
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:10,875
Nice to see you.

212
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:13,175
See you guys then.

213
00:12:13,175 --> 00:12:14,975
Hey, Mitsuhiko...

214
00:12:16,275 --> 00:12:19,475
-He's here! -He sure was, Genta!

215
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:24,375
Hurry...

216
00:12:25,175 --> 00:12:26,675
Here I am again.

217
00:12:26,675 --> 00:12:29,875
This is the best place to kill time after all.

218
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:33,275
He's carrying a bag that looked really similar on his left shoulder.

219
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:35,875
It seems quite certain that he's the mule.

220
00:12:41,175 --> 00:12:42,475
Bull's eye!

221
00:12:48,575 --> 00:12:50,875
What's the matter, Ms. Sato?

222
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,475
-Hurry, get the bag. -Wait.

223
00:12:53,475 --> 00:12:55,975
Let him be until he goes off to make the deal.

224
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,875
We'll nab him just when he makes contact with the dealer.

225
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,575
But my bag...

226
00:13:01,575 --> 00:13:05,475
Did you have something very important inside it, after all?

227
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:09,575
Yes. It's what I was planning to give you, Ms. Sato.

228
00:13:09,575 --> 00:13:10,575
A...

229
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,175
Finger... ("Yubi" means "finger" in Japanese)

230
00:13:14,175 --> 00:13:16,175
What? Finger?

231
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:20,475
A ri... A...

232
00:13:20,475 --> 00:13:21,975
A ring... ("Yubiwa" means "ring" in Japanese)

233
00:13:21,975 --> 00:13:23,075
A mail? ("Ring" sounds similar to "mail" in Japanese)

234
00:13:23,075 --> 00:13:25,475
Do you mean a letter?

235
00:13:25,475 --> 00:13:28,075
Gosh, if you have something you want to say to me,

236
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:30,175
why don't you tell me directly as a man should?

237
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:32,875
You're right.

238
00:13:36,175 --> 00:13:38,175
Okay, we're going to approach the man,

239
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,275
so all of you stay close to me, all right?

240
00:13:43,275 --> 00:13:44,675
It's a ring.

241
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:53,419
Inspector Shiratori, we found the man

242
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:55,719
that seems to have the bag in question.

243
00:13:55,719 --> 00:14:00,019
All right. Please check the contents then.

244
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:04,519
But Ms. Sato and the others are near that man too.

245
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:08,419
Does that mean that the ring inside the bag has already been...

246
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:11,319
No, it doesn't seem so.

247
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:14,619
Rather, it seems as if they're keeping watch over the man.

248
00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:17,319
Please tell me where you currently are.

249
00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:18,919
Let's get together there.

250
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,819
All officers gather at the Retro-Game Pavilion.

251
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:23,019
-Gather there? -He said that?

252
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:24,019
Roger.

253
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:26,419
Roger.

254
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:32,819
It's almost time.

255
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:34,119
I guess it's time I get going.

256
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,719
Let's go there next.

257
00:14:53,219 --> 00:14:55,219
What is this? Oh, my.

258
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:14,419
Where did he go?

259
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:17,219
It's okay. He's over there.

260
00:15:17,219 --> 00:15:19,219
Really!

261
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:20,319
He sat down.

262
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,119
Now, we're about to start

263
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:24,519
the greatest event of this tropical night,

264
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:27,719
the vivid bursting fireworks in the night sky.

265
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,819
It's show time!

266
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:38,519
I don't believe that they're going to go through a drug deal

267
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,119
in a bustling place like this.

268
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:43,519
Maybe it's a good place because it's so unlikely?

269
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:00,919
That's...

270
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,919
the drug dealer, Asakichi Yakura!

271
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,819
Okay, I don't know what this is about

272
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:09,019
but take it with you right away and give me the cash.

273
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:12,419
Hold it. The deal starts after the fireworks are displayed in the sky.

274
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:15,619
When all people are looking up at the fireworks.

275
00:16:15,619 --> 00:16:18,019
Oh, talk about being careful.

276
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,719
It must be something super illegal.

277
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:24,319
It's better for you to not think about unnecessary things.

278
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:28,219
You're a mule, and that's all that matters.

279
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:31,219
So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so very much for waiting.

280
00:16:31,219 --> 00:16:38,319
The great 300 shots fireworks show is about to begin!

281
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:41,019
Officer Takagi, take care of the children.

282
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:42,319
Ms. Sato!

283
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:44,119
Inspector, there is a male among the audience

284
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:46,219
that resembles a suspect on the wanted list.

285
00:16:46,219 --> 00:16:47,219
What?

286
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:51,419
Okay, now is the time.

287
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:53,519
Put the stuff on my lap.

288
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:55,919
What?

289
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:04,219
Police!

290
00:17:04,219 --> 00:17:05,819
Freeze, both of you.

291
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:09,919
No way.

292
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,219
Didn't you hear another sound other than the fireworks just now?

293
00:17:27,219 --> 00:17:29,119
Yeah, I heard it. It's a loud bang!

294
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:36,419
Yakura!

295
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:37,419
Ms. Sato!

296
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:39,219
What the hell are you doing? Let's go after him!

297
00:17:39,219 --> 00:17:40,219
All right!

298
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:53,519
Inspector, the two are going after Yakura.

299
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,419
Moreover, he's armed with a gun.

300
00:17:55,419 --> 00:17:57,719
Roger. All officers on site,

301
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:59,319
keep in mind the safety of all the people here

302
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,719
while supporting Officer Sato and Officer Takagi!

303
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:06,619
Hey! Freeze!

304
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:10,419
Freeze, my foot. There's no way, man.

305
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:17,119
Up ahead is where the pleasure cruiser is.

306
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:39,519
Ms. Sato?

307
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:45,819
Oh, no. He's probably planning on hijacking the boat using his gun

308
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:47,319
and flee to the other side.

309
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:56,519
No, you don't!

310
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,619
The ring!

311
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:22,719
Darn it!

312
00:19:41,219 --> 00:19:44,119
My ring!

313
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:02,019
Well, good work, Officer Takagi.

314
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:04,019
Inspector Shiratori?

315
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:05,519
What brings you here?

316
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,419
Well, we got a tip about a drug deal

317
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:11,319
that was to be held here and were staking out.

318
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:14,319
By the way, where is your bag

319
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:16,019
that the mule mistakenly took?

320
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:17,619
Huh? Well...

321
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:22,019
It went down into the sea when I caught the suspect.

322
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:27,319
Well, there wasn't much in it, so it doesn't matter.

323
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:30,919
Not much, he said.

324
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:32,919
I'm glad then.

325
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:35,819
Okay, case closed. Case closed.

326
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,819
Shall we go have a shot tonight?

327
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,819
Sounds good.

328
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:42,319
You can come too, can't you?

329
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:45,419
Yes, after I take the children home.

330
00:20:47,219 --> 00:20:48,919
Ms. Sato!

331
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:51,619
Ms. Sato, we got the suspect!

332
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:54,719
Ms. Sato.

333
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,319
What's the matter?

334
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:59,219
Are you crying?

335
00:20:59,219 --> 00:21:01,819
It's probably because of that incident.

336
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:05,419
It can't be...

337
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:20,719
She seemed to have a flashback on the memory

338
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:24,119
of Officer Matsuda who died on duty on the Ferris Wheel.

339
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,919
You idiot!

340
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,919
Why did you choose a place like this for a date?

341
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:12,219
The pits.

342
00:23:12,219 --> 00:23:14,819
What a dork!

343
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:17,119
I... I'm sorry.

344
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:19,719
It didn't dawn on me.

345
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,819
Hey, will you promise me?

346
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:29,019
That you will always be with me...

347
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,519
and you will never disappear before me.

348
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:38,519
Give me your word!

349
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:48,219
Although Officer Takagi lost his important bag...

350
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:53,019
but he got a hold of something more important.

351
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:33,846
Next Conan's Hint:

352
00:24:33,846 --> 00:24:36,246
"Cell phone strap"

353
00:24:36,246 --> 00:24:38,646
A date without a ring and a car without an air conditioner.

354
00:24:38,646 --> 00:24:41,092
-How sad... -Did you just see a penguin?
