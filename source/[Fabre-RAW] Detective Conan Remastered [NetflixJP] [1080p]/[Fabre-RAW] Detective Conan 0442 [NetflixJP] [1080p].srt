1
00:00:03,298 --> 00:00:04,698
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:04,698 --> 00:00:06,598
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:06,598 --> 00:00:07,898
A falling object changes a person's life.

4
00:00:07,898 --> 00:00:09,298
Differences in thought causes an incident,

5
00:00:09,298 --> 00:00:10,998
the Youth Detective Squad, put a stop to it!

6
00:00:10,998 --> 00:00:12,298
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,298 --> 00:00:13,898
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,898 --> 00:00:15,998
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:58,439
"Beika Station"

10
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:07,339
What a huge eel over rice.

11
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:11,839
Genta, you're not getting anywhere staring at it like that forever.

12
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:14,239
I'd sure like to taste it.

13
00:02:15,339 --> 00:02:16,639
Look out!

14
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:22,839
Are you all right?

15
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,239
Did he get hit?

16
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,739
I'm sure he dodged it in time.

17
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:30,139
I think he just passed out.

18
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:32,739
-Mitsuhiko! -Yes, an ambulance, right?

19
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:35,439
"Watanabe Central Hospital"

20
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:39,639
How was it, Officer Takagi?

21
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,839
It seems to have simple mistake in operating the crane.

22
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:45,139
Which means that it was an accident and not a case?

23
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:48,639
Yes. Besides, I just asked the nurse station

24
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,539
and was told that although he broke a foot from the fall,

25
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:54,139
there were no abnormalities found in his head or brain.

26
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:55,839
Only, since he's still passed out,

27
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:59,539
they cannot identify who or where he's from.

28
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:00,639
Oh, I just remembered!

29
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,839
This is his belongings!

30
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:06,339
Something that may help identify him may be in his belongings.

31
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,639
What's this rope for?

32
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,139
This is...

33
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,839
A rope.

34
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:22,339
Working gloves.

35
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,039
A wallet.

36
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,239
An envelope?

37
00:03:29,339 --> 00:03:32,039
"I'm tired of going on living, already."

38
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,739
-Could this be... -A will.

39
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:34,839
Then, that man...

40
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:38,239
Tried to commit suicide using a rope.

41
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,439
Daijirou Manaka, 27 years old.

42
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,939
He's only in his 20's, but he says that he's tired of living,

43
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:46,939
like he's an aged person already!

44
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:48,539
True.

45
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:49,539
Besides...

46
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:52,439
What on earth is this?

47
00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:00,539
"Man Hindered by a Steel-Frame"

48
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:07,139
You've finally awaken, Mr. Manaka.

49
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:08,239
I'm from the police.

50
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,939
What on earth is this?

51
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,439
Please explain what's going on.

52
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,739
Mr. Manaka!

53
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:23,139
Manaka? Is that my name?

54
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:24,439
Yes?

55
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:30,639
No good, I don't remember anything!

56
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:38,439
Poor thing, not even knowing who he actually is.

57
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:41,039
Okay, I'll try shock treatment on him!

58
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:42,739
No, Genta!

59
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:44,239
Why're you stopping me?

60
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:46,839
He's forgotten everything for now, but what if his memory returns

61
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:49,739
and he decides to commit suicide again?

62
00:04:49,739 --> 00:04:52,439
Oh, I see.

63
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:55,739
In other words, I've got to keep my eyes on him

64
00:04:55,739 --> 00:04:58,439
to keep him from danger

65
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:01,739
because there's no way of knowing when his memory will return.

66
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:03,439
We want to help him get back his memory,

67
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,539
but how we do if he may commit suicide?

68
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,139
What can we do?

69
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:10,739
Let's solve the problem with our own hands

70
00:05:10,739 --> 00:05:12,539
before his memory comes back!

71
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,339
What's the problem?

72
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:18,039
He must've had a problem that made him want to commit suicide.

73
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:20,239
So, all we have to do is solve that for him.

74
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:22,239
Then he won't think of committing suicide again!

75
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:25,239
Okay, off goes the Youth Detective Squad!

76
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:26,439
Yeah!

77
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,339
That man...

78
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:30,539
What's up, Conan?

79
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,139
I wonder if he's really got amnesia.

80
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:34,639
Are you saying that he's lying?

81
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,039
He's lying?

82
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:39,939
When a person lies, it inadvertently shows on the person's face.

83
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,839
They blink a lot, or their eye wander.

84
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:46,739
That man's eyes were wandering.

85
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:48,439
That's because of his anxiety.

86
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:50,739
I mean after all, he couldn't remember his own name.

87
00:05:50,739 --> 00:05:55,139
Why would he have to fake having amnesia in the first place?

88
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:56,839
Beats me.

89
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:59,339
I don't think it's good to suspect him for something you have no idea of.

90
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:02,839
But, something bothers me about him.

91
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:05,539
Come to think of it, even about that matter.

92
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:06,739
What matter?

93
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:10,439
Back then, he was heading South on Beika-cho, right?

94
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,739
The only thing that's there is a residential district.

95
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,039
If he were contemplating suicide, wouldn't he go the other way,

96
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,439
towards the mountains or some place where there are not too many people?

97
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:21,439
There are places with no people in residential areas too.

98
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:23,439
Could be but...

99
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,439
That's fine!

100
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:26,839
It seems like Conan doesn't want to cooperate,

101
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:27,939
so let's do it on our own.

102
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:31,539
First, let's find out what kind of problem Mr. Manaka had.

103
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:32,539
-Okay! -Yeah!

104
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:34,939
We've got to stop him committing suicide, no matter what.

105
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:37,039
Yeah, prevent his suicide! Prevent his suicide!

106
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,739
Hey, I'm going too!

107
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:42,639
Is Mr. Manaka an artist?

108
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,139
He's not famous at all though.

109
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,539
But, it's a pretty drawing.

110
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:51,439
They're all simple and nice drawings.

111
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:53,039
He's a very serious person,

112
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,939
who takes about six months to finish one drawing.

113
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:59,039
That's why he ends up not being able to pay his rent.

114
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,939
Did he have problems with money?

115
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:03,439
Mr. Daijirou Manaka.

116
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,539
Give us back what you owe us today!

117
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:08,039
Interest and all, the total is 2 million yen!

118
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:09,939
Mr. Manaka's not in.

119
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:13,339
Shoots! We're coming back again later.

120
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:15,439
If Mr. Manaka were to have any problems,

121
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:17,339
debts are all I can think of.

122
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:20,739
After all, those two come everyday and bug him to pay them back.

123
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:23,039
If money is what his problem is,

124
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,239
the Youth Detective Squad can't do anything about it.

125
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:28,739
But, we can't give up just like that!

126
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:33,039
Isn't there anyone who'll lend Mr. Manaka money?

127
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,639
He has no family, he does have an uncle.

128
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,939
But no matter how many times he went and asked for help,

129
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:40,439
it seems his uncle didn't lend him even a cent.

130
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:42,839
Is his uncle also poor?

131
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,639
His uncle is filthy rich!

132
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,539
He's called Mr. Ginbayashi, and owns a big mansion in Beika South.

133
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,539
Beika South?

134
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:52,039
Oh yeah, there's a really big mansion

135
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,639
with the name plate Ginbayashi on it!

136
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,439
He's a lone man with no family too,

137
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:03,339
so I don't see why he isn't a bit nicer to his only blood-related nephew?

138
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:06,339
Only blood related nephew.

139
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:08,139
I see, so that's the story!

140
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:10,439
What's up, Mitsuhiko?

141
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,439
I got it!

142
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,739
Have you figured out a way to solve Mr. Manaka's money problem?

143
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:25,139
-Not yet. -Then what did you figure out?

144
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:29,039
The reason Mr. Manaka was walking where he was.

145
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,739
You figured it out, Mitsuhiko?

146
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:36,139
Mr. Manaka was on his way to his uncle's house in Beika South!

147
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:37,739
That's most likely.

148
00:08:37,739 --> 00:08:41,739
His purpose was to commit suicide at his uncle's house

149
00:08:41,739 --> 00:08:43,439
to get back at him...

150
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,939
"Ginbayashi"

151
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:53,039
for not lending him money no matter how many times he asked.

152
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,539
I see!

153
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,839
Unfortunately, Mitsuhiko, that doesn't explain anything.

154
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,339
The truth is probably...

155
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:04,639
What's up, Conan?

156
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,339
Not again! Hey!

157
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:13,939
I thought you all went home.

158
00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:16,039
No, this bugged me after all.

159
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:20,839
Does your foot hurt?

160
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,839
The anesthesia's wearing off, so yeah...

161
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,039
But, I'm glad, that all you broke is the bone of your leg.

162
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,339
If it were your hands, you wouldn't be able to draw.

163
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:31,739
True.

164
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:34,739
He knows that he's an artist.

165
00:09:34,739 --> 00:09:36,839
He's lying about having lost his memory after all.

166
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,139
He didn't want to give himself away being questioned by Officer Takagi

167
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:43,439
so he decided on the spot to feign having lost his memory.

168
00:09:46,739 --> 00:09:50,839
About him heading over to his uncle's place back then

169
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:53,939
is probably just as Mitsuhiko deduced.

170
00:09:53,939 --> 00:09:56,539
But, it wasn't to commit suicide.

171
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:59,939
But rather, to make it look like suicide and kill Ginbayashi.

172
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:03,839
Those gloves were to not leave his fingerprints behind.

173
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,339
The contents of the will make sense, if this was the case.

174
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:09,839
"I'm tired of going on living, already."

175
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,739
That's what an aged person would say!

176
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:15,739
If Mr. Ginbayashi dies, the entire estate

177
00:10:15,739 --> 00:10:18,439
will fall into the hands of his only blood-related nephew, Mr. Manaka.

178
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:20,439
That was probably what he was after.

179
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:24,339
The problem is, how can I prove this attempted scheme?

180
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:25,739
What can I do?

181
00:10:25,739 --> 00:10:27,439
Conan!

182
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:30,739
We were looking for you because you suddenly disappeared.

183
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:32,839
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

184
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:33,839
Yes?

185
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,939
Let's say there's a murder scheme here.

186
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:39,939
It's a crime that involves a person's life.

187
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:43,839
But, nothing's happened yet, it's going to happen in the future,

188
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,439
so there's no proof yet.

189
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:48,639
How would you corner such a culprit?

190
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:51,639
There's no need to corner the culprit!

191
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:58,239
If it hasn't happened yet, then you prevent it from happening!

192
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:01,739
Exactly.

193
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:04,039
There you are, Conan!

194
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,739
We looked all over for you!

195
00:11:05,739 --> 00:11:10,139
Let's go to his uncle Mr. Ginbayashi's place and ask him to help out.

196
00:11:10,739 --> 00:11:13,339
If he helps out with the debts,

197
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,539
Mr. Manaka won't have to think of doing something

198
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:17,639
as stupid as he did anymore, would he?

199
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:20,239
You mean when you said involving someone's life,

200
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:22,439
you were referring to suicide?

201
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:24,139
Just what are you talking about?

202
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:30,339
All I'm saying is let's stop a crime before it even happens!

203
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:40,567
Daijirou tried to commit suicide?

204
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,467
He happens to have amnesia right now.

205
00:11:44,467 --> 00:11:46,867
But, if his memory comes back, he may again think of...

206
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:48,667
His problem involves debts.

207
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,167
So long as you dish the cash out for him...

208
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,967
-I have no intention of helping him out. -President.

209
00:11:53,967 --> 00:11:56,267
You can still save him now.

210
00:11:56,267 --> 00:11:58,467
I don't know if I should be telling you children this,

211
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:02,367
but after graduating from university, Daijirou worked for a bank.

212
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:04,367
I was happy.

213
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:06,367
Especially because I was thinking of having him succeed my company

214
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:08,367
when the time came.

215
00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:11,067
But, he quit the bank in six months.

216
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:14,067
Just to follow an old dream to become an artist.

217
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,767
He's a selfish guy who trampled all over me.

218
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,167
Why do I have to go out of my way to help a guy like that?

219
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:19,767
But...

220
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:22,767
The last he came here was last month.

221
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:25,067
He asked me to lend him money.

222
00:12:25,067 --> 00:12:26,967
A grown man begging on his hands a knees?

223
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:28,867
How wretched can you get?

224
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:34,267
Swear that you'll quit being an artist.

225
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:37,567
I'll lend you as much as you want if you do.

226
00:12:39,767 --> 00:12:40,767
Never mind already!

227
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:43,367
I'm not asking a snob like you for anything anymore!

228
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:47,167
Well said. Don't you ever show your face again!

229
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:51,167
I told him that I'd help him but he refused, that idiot.

230
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:57,367
Money may not be his only purpose.

231
00:12:57,367 --> 00:12:59,967
Maybe Mr. Manaka thought of killing him

232
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:02,667
because of a grudge against him for not understanding his feelings.

233
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:04,967
It's time for me to go to work.

234
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:06,667
Get ready, will you, Hinuma?

235
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:07,867
But, president...

236
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:10,067
He clung to his dream.

237
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:12,967
If so, he can starve to death or commit suicide.

238
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:15,067
He's free to do what he pleases!

239
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:18,867
Mr. Ginbayashi!

240
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:21,067
His eyes were wandering too.

241
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:28,167
What a cruel uncle.

242
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:29,367
-Conan! -Conan!

243
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:31,167
No use, there's nothing more we can do!

244
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:34,367
I can't let anything like this happen!

245
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:35,667
"Ginbayashi Corporation"

246
00:13:46,967 --> 00:13:50,067
Are you sure you don't have to go see Daijirou at the hospital?

247
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:52,867
Just let that guy be!

248
00:13:52,867 --> 00:13:55,367
I know that's not how you truly feel.

249
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,067
He wasn't being truthful after all.

250
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:58,267
You couldn't let him be,

251
00:13:58,267 --> 00:14:01,567
that's why each time there's an exhibition...

252
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:11,467
You secretly send me there to buy his drawings.

253
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:13,867
Shut up!

254
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,667
Stop pestering me. I'm not dishing out any cash!

255
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:26,367
You were secretly buying his drawings for him up to now too, weren't you?

256
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:27,567
You eavesdropped?

257
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,067
But, if you do it in secret,

258
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:33,667
Mr. Manaka won't know that you are rooting for him, right?

259
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,667
And because he doesn't know,

260
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:39,567
so I think that Mr. Manaka hates you a whole lot.

261
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:41,967
I think so too.

262
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:43,967
It's about time you tell Daijirou how you really feel.

263
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,967
Don't get me wrong, Hinuma!

264
00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:49,267
I didn't ask you to go buy his drawings because I support his activity.

265
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:50,967
I did so to burn his drawings!

266
00:14:51,967 --> 00:14:54,167
Where are the drawings I asked you to go buy, then?

267
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:56,267
There are none of them here or at the mansion.

268
00:14:56,267 --> 00:14:57,767
Of course there aren't.

269
00:14:57,767 --> 00:15:02,167
I burnt them to ashes to spite him for trampling all over me.

270
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,767
No way.

271
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:06,667
It's because you're blood related to him after all, right?

272
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:07,967
Just what do you mean?

273
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:10,967
You're both so much alike.

274
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:13,767
Your eyes, both yours and Mr. Manaka's wander when you lie.

275
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:16,167
You brat. I'm kicking you out of here!

276
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:17,567
Give me a hand, Hinuma!

277
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:21,167
No, because I want to know why you're lying too, president!

278
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:22,367
What lie are you talking about?

279
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,767
Hold it, you cheeky brat!

280
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:27,267
You brat! Just what do you think you're doing?

281
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:28,767
I'm sorry!

282
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:37,967
Even if you lie, there's bound to be some kind of evidence.

283
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:40,867
I've found the evidence!

284
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:42,067
No way.

285
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:45,067
Hey, sir, please go see Mr. Manaka,

286
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:48,967
and tell him that you've been backing him up all this time!

287
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:50,567
If you don't,

288
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:53,067
this case will never come to an end!

289
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:55,167
"Watanabe Central Hospital"

290
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:11,067
It seems that they think for now that I was trying to commit suicide,

291
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:13,067
but I'm sure they'll eventually find out the truth.

292
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:15,767
No use feigning that you have amnesia any longer.

293
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:20,167
You were scheming to kill your uncle Mr. Daizo Ginbayashi.

294
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:21,367
You're under arrest!

295
00:16:22,267 --> 00:16:23,867
This is the end for you!

296
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:28,367
I can't leave things as is!

297
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:40,067
I see, you tried to solve the problem for him.

298
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:43,167
But, it turned out that there was nothing we could do.

299
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:45,867
Okay. Now, it's my turn.

300
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:47,867
I'll convince him after he gets his memory back.

301
00:16:47,867 --> 00:16:49,767
"No matter how bad of a financial problem you have,"

302
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:52,567
"you can't ever think of suicide," I'll say.

303
00:16:56,467 --> 00:16:58,967
They're the collectors!

304
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:02,267
He's lying about having lost his memory.

305
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:03,767
Don't think you can get away with something like this?

306
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:04,967
Stop!

307
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:08,567
Officer Takagi!

308
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:11,767
He heard us and fled!

309
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:12,967
Don't let him get away!

310
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:19,767
He's gone.

311
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:22,267
From here?

312
00:17:22,267 --> 00:17:25,467
He couldn't have! He's got a broken leg, you know!

313
00:17:25,467 --> 00:17:27,367
But where else did he...

314
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:30,767
He has amnesia, but he recognized the debt collector's voice?

315
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,167
It's reverse! He heard the voice of the collectors, he was shocked

316
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:35,667
and his memory returned!

317
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:37,667
So, shock treatment did it after all!

318
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:40,367
His memory returned, which means...

319
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:42,167
He may be thinking of committing suicide?

320
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:05,367
Mr. Manaka disappeared?

321
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:07,767
We're looking for him but...

322
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:10,467
Nobody on that side saw him!

323
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:11,567
Same here.

324
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:14,667
Which means he could still be in the hospital?

325
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:16,967
Anyway, Conan, come over here too!

326
00:18:16,967 --> 00:18:17,967
Okay.

327
00:18:18,767 --> 00:18:20,567
He regained his memory

328
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:25,067
so unless we hurry, maybe this time for sure he'll commit suicide.

329
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:28,367
To be honest, you're worried about him, aren't you, Mr. Ginbayashi?

330
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:31,667
Hinuma, get the car!

331
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:36,167
He's not here.

332
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:37,167
There he is!

333
00:18:45,267 --> 00:18:46,367
He stopped.

334
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:48,367
Don't tell me he's going to jump in?

335
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:49,767
We've gotta hurry!

336
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:52,367
I can't walk any farther

337
00:18:52,367 --> 00:18:56,467
because I haven't eaten anything from yesterday so I'm starved.

338
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:59,667
I was striving to be an artist too.

339
00:19:00,467 --> 00:19:04,267
But, I couldn't make a living so I got rid of that dream.

340
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:06,167
So, that's the story.

341
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:08,367
Then, you more than anyone else should be able to understand

342
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:10,267
the difficulty that Daijirou is going through.

343
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:13,167
I'd figure you'd help him from your side.

344
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:14,467
Just the opposite.

345
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:16,867
Yeah, because he understands,

346
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:20,967
he more so deliberately gave Mr. Manaka the cold shoulder.

347
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:22,967
Don't die, Daijirou.

348
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:25,567
Don't take rash action!

349
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,967
Don't die!

350
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:28,767
Don't ever think of committing suicide!

351
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,567
Your memory returned, right?

352
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:32,967
I'll hear you out, tell me about it!

353
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:35,267
If you hear me out, I'll give myself away.

354
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:38,867
Don't come! I'm going to jump if you do!

355
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:42,467
We've finally found you!

356
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:43,767
Return our 2 million yen!

357
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,667
Stay away! All of you stay away!

358
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:48,067
If you come, I'll jump, I mean it!

359
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:50,867
I'll kill myself! I'll really kill myself!

360
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:57,867
Shouting repeatedly that you'll kill yourself. How wretched can you get?

361
00:19:57,867 --> 00:19:59,167
What brings you here?

362
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:01,667
When you came to tell me you wanted to become an artist,

363
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,667
I was against it!

364
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:05,867
I told you that you can't make a living as an artist.

365
00:20:05,867 --> 00:20:09,867
But you wouldn't listen to me. You decided to pursue your dream.

366
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:11,167
You idiot!

367
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:14,867
A snob like you would never understand how I feel!

368
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:18,267
Just as I thought, you came to me for help.

369
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:20,267
But, Daijirou,

370
00:20:20,267 --> 00:20:22,367
asking for help as soon as you fall into a rut

371
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:23,967
with such a dependent attitude,

372
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:26,367
you would never be able to realize your dream!

373
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:30,867
That's why I went out of my way not to pamper you.

374
00:20:30,867 --> 00:20:34,167
I refused to help you no matter how much you asked for help.

375
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:36,067
Stop talking to suit yourself!

376
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:38,967
But, you couldn't help not helping him,

377
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:41,267
so you were backing him up secretly, right?

378
00:20:42,267 --> 00:20:45,467
He was buying your paintings.

379
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:46,567
My paintings?

380
00:20:46,567 --> 00:20:49,167
He was buying your paintings and sending them to elementary schools.

381
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:50,267
See.

382
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:57,467
That's the elementary school I graduated from.

383
00:20:57,467 --> 00:21:00,467
This seems to be a thank you letter from the students there.

384
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,667
"Thank you for all the beautiful paintings!"

385
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:07,167
Beautiful drawings will always make the hearts of children richer.

386
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:09,767
I believed so, and kept on sending the drawings to them.

387
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:12,267
You bought my pictures.

388
00:21:12,267 --> 00:21:15,367
You were constantly helping me behind the scenes.

389
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:17,567
Why didn't you tell me?

390
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,167
I didn't help you!

391
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:20,967
I bought them because they were good drawings.

392
00:21:20,967 --> 00:21:24,067
They just so happened to be what you drew!

393
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:26,767
He's going out of his way to look like a snob.

394
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:29,167
He turned out to be a nice man that is really thinking about his nephew.

395
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:30,167
Yeah!

396
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:32,567
His eyes are wandering again.

397
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:35,967
2 million yen, was it?

398
00:21:35,967 --> 00:21:38,267
Thanks.

399
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:40,167
I'm not helping him!

400
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:42,067
I'm paying in advance

401
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:45,267
for the next drawing that the children are looking forward to!

402
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:46,867
Uncle.

403
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:49,167
I'm sorry. I was actually...

404
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:51,467
You need not say anything anymore.

405
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:54,267
Just don't ever think of committing suicide ever again!

406
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:00,967
I'm sorry.

407
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:02,667
I'm sorry, uncle!

408
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:07,667
It seems he didn't commit a crime

409
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:10,467
that involved someone's life.

410
00:22:10,467 --> 00:22:11,767
I guess so.

411
00:23:39,867 --> 00:23:42,067
I really want to taste this.

412
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:43,767
He's looking at it again.

413
00:23:43,767 --> 00:23:46,967
It's going to come falling again, the steel-frames!

414
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,167
Look out!

415
00:23:49,367 --> 00:23:53,167
Oh, that was close. I almost drooled on my shirt.

416
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:54,167
Conan?

417
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:56,267
What are you doing?

418
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:58,767
I wonder.

419
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,180
Next Conan's Hint:

420
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,300
"Pair look parkas"

421
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,660
I hope a bowl of eel over rice comes falling.

422
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,760
 It falling!

423
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,820
It could never happen.
