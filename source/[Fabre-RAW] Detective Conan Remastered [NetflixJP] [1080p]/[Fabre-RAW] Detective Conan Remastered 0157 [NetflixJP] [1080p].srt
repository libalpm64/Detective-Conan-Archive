1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,510
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,210
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,210
In today's episode, Doctor Agasa causes a ruckus.

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,310
A bomb is involved in the mystery.

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,810
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:13,710
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,010
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,150
We snuck into an abandoned building

9
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,150
to practice for our school play.

10
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,850
An escaped prisoner,

11
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,850
being chased by Officer Sato and Officer Takagi bursts in.

12
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,250
He makes it to the next building from the rooftop.

13
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,150
Officer Sato captures the suspect in the toilet...

14
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,650
but due to a slight mistake,

15
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,350
the two are stuck and unable to get free.

16
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:05,050
The suspect, Mr. Higashida pleads his innocence.

17
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,150
He says he tried to escape so he could go to Chicago

18
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,750
to attend his daughter's wedding.

19
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,950
That's how Officer Takagi and the Youth Detective Squad

20
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,550
are sent out to find the real killer.

21
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:25,850
"Metropolitan Police Officer Love Story 2 (Part 2)"

22
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,250
There are four things out of place.

23
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,850
The first thing is the color of the mattress,

24
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,550
sheets, pillow and the curtain beside the bed.

25
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,050
Everything from the kitchenware,

26
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,650
to the dishes down to the interior is in beige.

27
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,850
Why then is only the bed and curtain in gray?

28
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,150
I suppose it's just coincidence.

29
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,750
But there were beige sheets and curtains in the closet.

30
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,950
The second thing is, why was this calendar

31
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,550
taken off the wall next to the bed.

32
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,350
See, this is this year's Tokyo Spirits calendar,

33
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,750
it was in the closet.

34
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,250
It matches the spot on the wall perfectly.

35
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,950
She probably took it down

36
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,750
because the team's not doing so good lately.

37
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,750
But look.

38
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,550
Her whole schedule until December is written in.

39
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,650
You're right.

40
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,850
The third thing is,

41
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,550
there're slight traces the furniture's been moved.

42
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,750
The men from the crime lab mentioned that too,

43
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,850
they said she'd probably rearranged the room.

44
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,950
But don't you think it's strange

45
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:31,050
she wouldn't notice she'd crushed something this valuable

46
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,150
when she moved the chest?

47
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,650
It's just a box of matches.

48
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,750
Open it up.

49
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,050
There's a piece of paper inside.

50
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,650
Why this is?

51
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,050
It's her marriage registration.

52
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,150
She was getting married.

53
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,550
But the groom's name hasn't been filled in.

54
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,050
His seal is on it though.

55
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,950
The fourth thing is the cactus.

56
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,150
On the day of the murder,

57
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,050
it had been raining heavily since morning.

58
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,850
Would a cactus lover such as her leave the pots outside?

59
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,450
Which means someone besides the victim

60
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:08,050
moved things around for some unknown reason.

61
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,150
Yes, here it is.

62
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,750
This is the gold dolphin cactus the pub owner gave her

63
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,050
on the day she was killed.

64
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,650
But the thorns are bent, poor thing.

65
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,350
It can't be...

66
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,850
You don't mean, this room?

67
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,550
Shall we go check it out then?

68
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,050
His apartment is in this condominium building too, isn't it?

69
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,550
Yes, let's go.

70
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,050
What's this?

71
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,350
Hey, you kids. You will catch cold if you sleep here.

72
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,450
Land lord.

73
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,150
I'm very surprised.

74
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,050
Tear you up all night investigating?

75
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,150
Yes.

76
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,650
But fortunately, we were able to solve the crime...

77
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,550
completely.

78
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,950
Your cooperation was greatly appreciated.

79
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,350
Don't mention it.

80
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,350
I'm glad I was able to help.

81
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,750
Now how do we get the killer to confess?

82
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,950
Hey!

83
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,450
Is anybody in there?

84
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,650
Hey!

85
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,850
Good grief, this is the fifth time

86
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,650
the cops asked us to search the place.

87
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,450
The place was locked up, no one could've gotten in.

88
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,950
Hey!

89
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,650
The lock's been broken.

90
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,850
Are you serious?

91
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:34,250
That weird guy playing cops and robbers with those kids probably did this.

92
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,450
That a bother.

93
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,850
The place is going to be blown up

94
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,250
but I will put a new lock on anyway.

95
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,750
By the way, what was the name of that bomb again?

96
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,350
Boy, did you forget already?

97
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,450
It's the Tropical Rainbow.

98
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,350
What? Takagi was seen in Haido?

99
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,450
Are you sure?

100
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:03,850
Yes. A young couple sat a man that looked just like Officer Takagi.

101
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,750
And? What about Sato? There they together?

102
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:11,150
Well, it seems he wasn't with Officer Sato,

103
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,950
he was with or 5 little kids...

104
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,350
You idiot!

105
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,650
What kind of police officer plays with little kids

106
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,850
while he's in the middle of a case?

107
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,850
It's the wrong guy, keep looking!

108
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,150
Incompetents, the whole lot of then.

109
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,850
Excuse me, Inspector Megure.

110
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,850
Yes, Shiratori, what is it?

111
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,850
I realize it's a long shot but,

112
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,650
the kids couldn't be those pint sized detectives

113
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,850
from Mouri's office, could it...

114
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,850
It can't be.

115
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:39,250
But it could explain why Officer Sato hasn't called in.

116
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,650
Do you mean she's...

117
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,550
She's probably being kept hostage by the killer.

118
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,950
Oh God, so it's true.

119
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,250
Listen, kids.

120
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,450
If you're sleepy, why don't you go on home?

121
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,750
No way.

122
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,350
Don't be mean, we want to help too.

123
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,350
Not listen.

124
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,550
Please let us help you.

125
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,450
I bet you want to catch the killer by yourself

126
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,050
so you can take all the credit and look good.

127
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,450
Well... That's what we police are supposed to do, it's our job.

128
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:19,350
The time... we don't have much time left.

129
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,450
Come on, let's get going

130
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,850
to the real killer's home.

131
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,350
Five minutes until the time limit.

132
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,950
It looks like they couldn't do it.

133
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,350
Don't cry.

134
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,750
We weren't able to get you to your daughter's wedding

135
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,150
but I promise we'll get the real killer

136
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,850
and prove your innocence.

137
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,250
You know, it's strange...

138
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,850
The custodians should have arrived already to clean the toilets.

139
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,050
Maybe they're closed today?

140
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,950
That's impossible, today's Sunday.

141
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,650
And listen, you can hear all the people's voices.

142
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,650
They're probably lined up outside waiting for it to open.

143
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,650
"Farewell to the Haido City Art Museum"

144
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,250
"Bombing even countdown, 34 Minutes 04 Seconds"

145
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,850
"Kitagawa"

146
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,550
Why? You're that police officer I met last night.

147
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,150
Hello again.

148
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,450
Didn't you hear me?

149
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,250
I said I already talked to the police.

150
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,650
I know but I'd like to know

151
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,150
about when you discovered the more body.

152
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,750
I already told you,

153
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,950
both Higashida and Ms. Muranishi didn't report to work

154
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,950
and they didn't answer their phone so I went to the apartment.

155
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,150
I rang the buzzer but there was no answer

156
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,450
so I asked the landlord to use the master key

157
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,150
and open to check there was no landlord to use the door,

158
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,450
Ms. Muranishi's place was first.

159
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,950
The door chain was on and for some reason,

160
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:52,550
Higashida was asleep on her bed I shouted from outside the door

161
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,450
and got him to wake up and unhook the chain,

162
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,450
then the landlord and I went in

163
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,350
and found Ms. Muranishi dead on the bathroom floor.

164
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,750
And that's it, end of story.

165
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,450
Mr. Kitagawa.

166
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,850
That's all I have to say, now please leave.

167
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,650
Please let me ask you some questions.

168
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:17,550
What is it? Don't tell me you suspect me?

169
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,550
No, nothing like that.

170
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,450
Of course we do!

171
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,450
You're the killer, aren't you?

172
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,450
Don't try to lie to us!

173
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,150
You can't get away with committing a murder!

174
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:34,050
Kids, quiet. Behave.

175
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,150
Stop that... there's a way to do these things.

176
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,450
Who the heck are these kids?

177
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,150
-We're the Youth Detective Squad. -We're the Youth Detective Squad.

178
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,950
There's no case we can't solve.

179
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,650
This is...

180
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,650
Good grief, I don't know what this is all about

181
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,650
but give me a break.

182
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:54,350
Under those circumstances I couldn't possibly be the killer.

183
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:58,450
Then why change the color of the sheets and the curtain?

184
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,250
You did it, didn't you?

185
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,750
You changed the color of the sheets and curtains

186
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,150
from beige to gray.

187
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,650
Hey!

188
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,750
I've had just about enough.

189
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,450
Take these kids and get out here right now

190
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,550
or I'll sue you for defamation of character.

191
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,950
We were just at the department store near here

192
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,850
and got all the proof we need.

193
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,250
What?

194
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,950
You bought gray blanket covers,

195
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,450
sheets and curtains,

196
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,950
we have the salesclerk's testimony.

197
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,650
So what?

198
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:36,150
I bought them to replace the ones in my place which were old.

199
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,150
But I didn't like then so I threw then away.

200
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,850
You also took Ms. Muranishi's calendar off

201
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,850
and put her cactus pots out on the veranda, didn't you?

202
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,150
But then you had no choice.

203
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,750
Higashida is anti-Spirits,

204
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,050
if he saw that calendar

205
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,250
and the cactus he'd never bought in his supposed room,

206
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,350
although he was drunk,

207
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,650
you couldn't risk the chance he'd notice.

208
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:03,650
That's right, you removed everything

209
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,550
that would identify it as her room,

210
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,250
then you changed the curtains and bedding,

211
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,550
rearranged the furniture

212
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,050
to make it look like his room

213
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,650
then after you killed Ms. Muranishi

214
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,150
and brought Higashida to her room,

215
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,350
having gotten him drunk earlier that evening at the pub,

216
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,650
you created an illusion...

217
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,750
and made him believe he was in his own place.

218
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,450
He was drunk,

219
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,150
you had him put the door chain on himself.

220
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,250
After you made sure it was done,

221
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,650
all you had to do was have him lock the door.

222
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,850
He was so drunk, he went straight to bed.

223
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,850
The next morning, he would be found in a locked apartment

224
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,950
along with her body.

225
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,050
That's how it happened.

226
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,650
What about the video cord?

227
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:55,950
That about the cord they found wrapped around her neck?

228
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,350
His fingerprints were on it.

229
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,250
Haibara, did you find it?

230
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,750
Just as I'd imagined.

231
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,750
One video cord is missing from his unit.

232
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,350
Higashida was an expert with video equipment.

233
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,150
You probably asked him to hook up your video,

234
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:18,050
then used the cord as the weapon, didn't you?

235
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,050
On top of that,

236
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,650
you took off from work the day of the murder that afternoon,

237
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:25,450
you climbed the emergency stairs to get to her apartment.

238
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,950
You used the spare key she gave you to get in,

239
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,550
fixed the apartment up, then waited for her to get back from work

240
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,850
and when she did, you strangled her, there's our evidence.

241
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,450
What evidence? That's ridiculous!

242
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,950
Show me the evidence then!

243
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:43,150
Show me the evidence that proves I killed her.

244
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,150
There is no such thing.

245
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:49,850
I did take that day off but I did not see her.

246
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:56,150
Sir, what happened to you?

247
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,950
How'd you hurt that finger...

248
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,750
I wonder what the music's for?

249
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,750
Oh well, it's nice to have music to wait by.

250
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,950
"Farewell to the Haido City Art Museum"

251
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,150
"Bombing even countdown, 10 Minutes"

252
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,550
Well, ladies and gentlemen.

253
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,050
In another 10 minutes,

254
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,450
we will be biding farewell to the Haido City Art Museum

255
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,850
which has served us for 40 years.

256
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,650
Thank you for your service.

257
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,850
Did he say biding farewell?

258
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,250
And now I would like to call up the city's genius, Doctor Agasa

259
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,650
to say a few words,

260
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:44,150
he has given us full cooperation in celebrating this event.

261
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:55,050
I am Doctor Agasa, as just introduced.

262
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:58,750
The Tropical Rainbow bomb that I invented

263
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,750
will provide a beautiful and colorful end

264
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,350
befitting our art museum.

265
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,150
-What? -What?

266
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,150
What did he say?

267
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,250
I'm sure he said bomb.

268
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,250
Oh no...

269
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,950
This can't be happening!

270
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,340
Come on. That about your thumb you have a bandage on it

271
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,040
so it must be hurt.

272
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,140
So what if I did hurt it?

273
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,240
Take these kids and get out of here.

274
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,740
Please pardon me.

275
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,840
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

276
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,540
I knew it.

277
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,540
Explain this. How did you hurt your thumb?

278
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,140
Well...

279
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,640
We will know right away when've get that finger

280
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,540
and the damaged cactus analyzed back at headquarters.

281
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,640
Ms. Muranishi brought that cactus home that day.

282
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,740
After you killed her,

283
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,440
you rushed to put the cactus on the veranda, we're going to prove this.

284
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,340
So now, answer my question.

285
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,540
You said you didn't see her the day she was killed

286
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,140
but if that's so,

287
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,740
why was your blood on the cactus thorn when

288
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,640
Ms. Muranishi just got it from the pub owner that evening?

289
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,340
What?

290
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,140
Takagi was at the crime scene?

291
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,040
Yes, he searched the place

292
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,440
and then it seems he headed for the home of Mr. Kitagawa,

293
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,340
the man who discovered the body.

294
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,740
Alright.

295
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,940
The fool, what's he up to?

296
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,740
He supposed to be looking for the prisoner.

297
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,340
At any rate, let's go there.

298
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,340
Three minutes to ignition.

299
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,640
To do the honors will be our own Doctor Agasa.

300
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,240
Hello...

301
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,940
I don't believe it. The battery's dead.

302
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,940
What about your gun? We could shoot the chain...

303
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,940
I shot two into the drain pipe, once at the lock,

304
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,440
fired two warning shots,

305
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,640
I used up all five bullets.

306
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,440
Why didn't you save one bullet for later?

307
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,740
Because you kept running!

308
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,440
Oh brother! Takagi, where are you?

309
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,740
I can't get through.

310
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,740
I wonder what's going on with Officer Sato.

311
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,440
It's already past 10 am.

312
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,940
I bet someone from the art museum found then.

313
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,340
Yeah, sure, but let's hurry back anyway.

314
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,240
Takagi! What do you think you're doing?

315
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,040
Inspector Megure.

316
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,040
I've captured the real murderer.

317
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,440
Never mind that...

318
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,940
Real murderer?

319
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,040
Yes.

320
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,540
Ms. Muranishi was persistently pursuing Mr. Kitagawa here

321
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,640
to marry her so he killed her.

322
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,640
He tried to frame his co-worker, Mr. Higashida with the crime.

323
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,640
He's confessed to everything.

324
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,640
Inspector! Hurry, contact the chief of the Haido Police Station

325
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,640
and have him start the paperwork to get Mr. Higashida released.

326
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,840
Sure.

327
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,940
So, where is Officer Sato?

328
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,940
She is with Mr. Higashida at the Haido Art Museum.

329
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,940
Stop kidding around.

330
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,640
After all right about now, that place's...

331
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,540
Well, it's time. Friends!

332
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,240
Gather around me and I will countdown together!

333
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,440
What? There's people still inside the museum?

334
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,540
That's impossible.

335
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,140
Hello, you still there?

336
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,340
What's going on? Answer me!

337
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,140
Darn, there's no time left. Hurry.

338
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:36,040
Hurry...

339
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,940
Let's start.

340
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,740
10, 9, 8, 7,

341
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,440
6, 5, 4, 3,

342
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,140
2, 1!

343
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,640
Doctor Agasa?

344
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,540
Just in the nick of time.

345
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,640
There! At least you can move around now.

346
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,940
Where's Takagi?

347
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,440
Oh, him...

348
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,740
Officer Sato!

349
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,540
Takagi!

350
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,240
Officer Sato!

351
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,740
Takagi!

352
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,640
Officer Sato. I did it!

353
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,040
I did it! Officer Sato!

354
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,940
The toilet... Where is it?

355
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,640
I've been holding it in since yesterday.

356
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,040
There plumbing's off in the building

357
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,540
and you so late,

358
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,240
so come on and tell me quick.

359
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,340
I think there's one in the game center around the corner.

360
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,840
Officer Sato...

361
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,440
Officer Takagi.

362
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,440
Yes?

363
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,240
Officer Sato was crying wasn't she?

364
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,340
Takagi.

365
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,740
Yes.

366
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,940
You scum. What'd you do to Miwa?

367
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,040
Nothing, I don't know what you mean.

368
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,140
Officer Sato!

369
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,940
I see a marriage registration in the box of matches.

370
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,740
It was hidden under the matches.

371
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,440
The two had the keys to each other's room.

372
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,740
I think she left those matches in her place to surprise him

373
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,140
when he used then to light his cigarettes.

374
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,840
Right, Conan?

375
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,140
That Takagi surprised me.

376
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,840
He turned the whole case upside down in one night.

377
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,440
It couldn't be helped.

378
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,040
When the body was discovered,

379
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,540
the police had Mr. Higashida the most likely suspect

380
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,340
handed to them on a silver platter.

381
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,040
We had many reasons for doubting Mr. Higashida's guilt

382
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,840
and we started our investigation objectively,

383
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,740
not like the other detectives.

384
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,140
That's what Officer Takagi said.

385
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,440
What a guy.

386
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,040
He's a smart aleck.

387
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,540
"Narita Airport"

388
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,140
What a relief. He made it for the flight.

389
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,640
Yes.

390
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,840
On the other hand,

391
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,640
Inspector Megure gave an earful.

392
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,140
That was he said, "Don't you trust us?"

393
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,440
May I ask you one question?

394
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,240
Officer Sato, what do you think of Inspector Megure...

395
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,040
do you like him?

396
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,840
Oh my, how did you know?

397
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,940
The truth is I do.

398
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,140
I see.

399
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,440
After all, he's like a father to me.

400
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,340
Like a father?

401
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,940
Yes, a father.

402
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,640
My father was a police officer too.

403
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,440
He was killed on the job when I was in grade school,

404
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,940
that's why I can't help seeing my father in him.

405
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,840
In that broad build of Inspector Megure...

406
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,240
What? You look like you think I have a father-complex.

407
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,840
No.

408
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,340
Well, I guess I will go to dad...

409
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,340
I mean the Inspector and get yelled at.

410
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,940
The blowing up of the art museum which had been postponed

411
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,940
was carried out the next day with no problem.

412
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,640
Tropical Rainbow's a huge success.

413
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,240
By the way, our school play was changed

414
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,740
from Masked Yaiba to Detective Story.

415
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,540
Dad.

416
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,640
That a horrible case.

417
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,140
This tragedy was brought about because this father and daughter

418
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,440
didn't understand one another.

419
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,340
Father!

420
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,040
Ran and I are always misunderstanding each other and what was the case of death?
