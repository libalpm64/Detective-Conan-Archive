1
00:00:07,536 --> 00:00:08,936
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:08,936 --> 00:00:10,836
Turns out to a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:10,836 --> 00:00:12,236
Here comes the one hour summer special!

4
00:00:12,236 --> 00:00:13,536
A serial killer tries to murder a bride and groom

5
00:00:13,536 --> 00:00:15,336
at a wedding party full of cops.

6
00:00:15,336 --> 00:00:16,836
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:16,836 --> 00:00:18,636
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:18,636 --> 00:00:20,636
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:19,236
You did it.

10
00:02:21,736 --> 00:02:24,736
Finally! Finally the day has come!

11
00:02:24,736 --> 00:02:27,236
Defeating all my rivals,

12
00:02:27,236 --> 00:02:30,436
I am now going to have eternal love with her!

13
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:49,336
Ms. Sato!

14
00:02:59,836 --> 00:03:02,036
Takagi!

15
00:03:02,036 --> 00:03:04,236
Yumi? Is that Yumi?

16
00:03:05,236 --> 00:03:07,836
Takagi!

17
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:11,436
No, it is not Yumi that I'm going to marry.

18
00:03:11,436 --> 00:03:12,936
Not you, Yumi!

19
00:03:12,936 --> 00:03:14,436
Congratulations, Yumi!

20
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:15,636
I'm happy for you, Yumi!

21
00:03:16,736 --> 00:03:17,836
Wait a second!

22
00:03:19,436 --> 00:03:20,736
I can't talk?

23
00:03:20,736 --> 00:03:22,636
I can't move my body either.

24
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:23,836
Please help, Chiba!

25
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:26,036
Congratulations.

26
00:03:26,036 --> 00:03:30,236
Hey! Chiba, how can you eat a hamburger now?

27
00:03:30,236 --> 00:03:31,436
Inspector Megure?

28
00:03:31,436 --> 00:03:34,736
-Right, left. Right... -It's no good.

29
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:36,036
Takagi...

30
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,336
Congratulations, Takagi.

31
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:45,236
No. This is not what you think, Mr. Shiratori.

32
00:03:45,236 --> 00:03:46,736
Gosh, what should I do?

33
00:03:46,736 --> 00:03:47,836
This is bad.

34
00:03:50,136 --> 00:03:51,536
Ms. Sato!

35
00:03:51,536 --> 00:03:53,036
Congratulations...

36
00:03:53,036 --> 00:03:54,236
Takagi!

37
00:03:59,736 --> 00:04:01,836
Ouch.

38
00:04:01,836 --> 00:04:03,036
That hurts...

39
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:06,336
It was a dream. That hurts, but I'm glad it was only a dream.

40
00:04:11,636 --> 00:04:17,436
"Love Story of Metropolitan Detectives: Fake Wedding"

41
00:04:33,736 --> 00:04:35,336
This is yours.

42
00:04:35,336 --> 00:04:36,336
-Thanks. -No problem.

43
00:04:38,036 --> 00:04:40,736
Well, that was a nice wedding.

44
00:04:40,736 --> 00:04:41,836
It was.

45
00:04:41,836 --> 00:04:44,836
But it would've been nicer if I caught that bouquet.

46
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:48,336
Oh, please. You're too young for that.

47
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:52,636
Or do you have someone that proposed to you already?

48
00:04:52,636 --> 00:04:54,436
Well, not really.

49
00:04:54,436 --> 00:04:57,036
I just want to wear a wedding dress.

50
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:06,236
Then I'll get you a cheap rental one.

51
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:07,736
You can wear it and take a picture of yourself.

52
00:05:07,736 --> 00:05:08,736
Nevermind.

53
00:05:08,736 --> 00:05:10,836
It'll still be expensive though.

54
00:05:10,836 --> 00:05:12,036
No, please don't!

55
00:05:13,336 --> 00:05:15,336
-Come on! It's just for a little while. -The voice sounds familiar.

56
00:05:15,336 --> 00:05:16,336
Come on!

57
00:05:17,736 --> 00:05:18,936
What are you...

58
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:22,836
Officer Takagi?

59
00:05:22,836 --> 00:05:25,336
-You're going to get married? -Congratulations!

60
00:05:25,336 --> 00:05:27,436
Well, no...

61
00:05:27,436 --> 00:05:30,936
Why do I have to see them at a time like this?

62
00:05:30,936 --> 00:05:32,136
So who's the bride?

63
00:05:32,136 --> 00:05:35,736
Don't be foolish, Dad. It must be Officer Sato.

64
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:38,036
Wrong answer!

65
00:05:38,036 --> 00:05:41,536
The bride is me!

66
00:05:41,536 --> 00:05:43,536
Yumi...

67
00:05:43,536 --> 00:05:46,136
-You are Yumi Miyamoto? -What? I thought you liked...

68
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:47,936
I thought you liked Officer Sato, didn't you?

69
00:05:49,336 --> 00:05:51,536
Well, it's a long story.

70
00:05:51,536 --> 00:05:52,736
Well, well.

71
00:05:52,736 --> 00:05:54,736
You guys look awesome together.

72
00:05:54,736 --> 00:05:56,036
Inspector Shiratori.

73
00:05:56,036 --> 00:05:59,936
Why don't you get married with her right now?

74
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:02,636
Yeah, that's a good idea, darling!

75
00:06:02,636 --> 00:06:04,436
Hey, Yumi.

76
00:06:04,436 --> 00:06:05,436
Miwako.

77
00:06:05,436 --> 00:06:07,036
You know what's going on, right?

78
00:06:07,036 --> 00:06:09,336
You guys are the target today.

79
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,836
Yes, I know that all too well!

80
00:06:11,836 --> 00:06:14,636
And you're also going too far!

81
00:06:14,636 --> 00:06:16,236
Yes. I know.

82
00:06:17,436 --> 00:06:20,036
-Hey... -What in the world is happening here right now?

83
00:06:20,036 --> 00:06:21,636
Well, actually...

84
00:06:21,636 --> 00:06:22,636
Inspector Megure!

85
00:06:23,536 --> 00:06:27,236
What? Someone is trying to kill them?

86
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:28,936
Why Takagi and Yumi though?

87
00:06:28,936 --> 00:06:31,436
Actually, they are the fake target.

88
00:06:31,436 --> 00:06:38,636
The true target is the bride and the groom who called us for help.

89
00:06:38,636 --> 00:06:43,836
Six months ago, a masked robber broke into the bride's house.

90
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:47,736
She was lucky because the groom happened to be there and chased him out.

91
00:06:47,736 --> 00:06:49,936
But the robber said this before running away...

92
00:06:49,936 --> 00:06:51,136
You...

93
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:54,036
I will never forgive you.

94
00:06:54,036 --> 00:06:57,536
But that's what typical bad guys usually say, isn't it?

95
00:06:57,536 --> 00:07:00,336
Why do they have to pretend to be the target?

96
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:03,136
It wouldn't be like this if it were a plain robbery.

97
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:07,136
We found fingerprints on a cooking knife

98
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:09,636
that happened to match the fingerprints of a man,

99
00:07:09,636 --> 00:07:11,836
who is the suspect of four robbery cases.

100
00:07:11,836 --> 00:07:15,436
The robber took six lives during that time.

101
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:21,836
Firstly, he broke into the house silently, so nobody noticed him.

102
00:07:21,836 --> 00:07:25,436
Then he killed the victim by stabbing the throat with a knife.

103
00:07:25,436 --> 00:07:28,836
After he took all the valuables

104
00:07:28,836 --> 00:07:31,936
and set the house on fire, he immediately ran away.

105
00:07:31,936 --> 00:07:33,836
And the night before yesterday,

106
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:37,336
a piece of paper was found in the bride's mailbox.

107
00:07:37,336 --> 00:07:43,236
It said, "Happy marriage. My present should be coming to you soon."

108
00:07:43,236 --> 00:07:44,336
I see.

109
00:07:44,336 --> 00:07:48,136
Now I understand why you guys are disguised as the bride and groom.

110
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:51,736
But why does it have to be Officer Takagi and Officer Yumi?

111
00:07:51,736 --> 00:07:52,936
What?

112
00:07:52,936 --> 00:07:55,836
Are you saying that I'm not good enough for him?

113
00:07:55,836 --> 00:07:57,336
Well, no...

114
00:07:57,336 --> 00:07:58,936
What else could we do?

115
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:05,336
The bride, Rei Masudo, and the groom, Masateru Taira look like this.

116
00:08:05,336 --> 00:08:07,136
Here.

117
00:08:07,136 --> 00:08:08,136
I see.

118
00:08:08,136 --> 00:08:11,736
They look just like Takagi and the girl on the police car.

119
00:08:11,736 --> 00:08:13,036
Really?

120
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:17,136
Then, does the real wedding has been cancelled?

121
00:08:17,136 --> 00:08:21,436
No. The real wedding will be held, as the bride really wanted to.

122
00:08:21,436 --> 00:08:24,436
Well, police officers will be standing at the building entrance

123
00:08:24,436 --> 00:08:27,136
so people with no invitation cannot come in.

124
00:08:27,136 --> 00:08:29,036
So I suppose the only chance the killer can attack them

125
00:08:29,036 --> 00:08:32,536
is when the bride and groom come out of the church after the ceremony.

126
00:08:32,536 --> 00:08:35,836
That's when Takagi and Yumi will come to play.

127
00:08:35,836 --> 00:08:38,436
Of course, they'll be wearing protective vests.

128
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:43,136
Plus, all the wedding attendants will be undercover officers.

129
00:08:43,136 --> 00:08:44,936
Is it really going to be okay though?

130
00:08:44,936 --> 00:08:47,836
You never know how the killer is going to attack you, you know.

131
00:08:47,836 --> 00:08:49,336
Don't worry about that.

132
00:08:49,336 --> 00:08:53,836
If anything happens, Miwako is going to come and save us.

133
00:08:53,836 --> 00:08:55,336
-Right? -Yeah.

134
00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:57,236
I will save Takagi first though.

135
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:01,236
Gosh! You choose affection over friendship?

136
00:09:01,236 --> 00:09:03,036
I can't believe it!

137
00:09:03,036 --> 00:09:04,836
What can I say?

138
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,336
It is more likely that the groom is going to be attacked

139
00:09:07,336 --> 00:09:10,136
because he is the one who chased the killer out.

140
00:09:10,136 --> 00:09:12,136
Besides, you are too close to him.

141
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:13,236
Miwako.

142
00:09:15,036 --> 00:09:18,836
I'm sorry. You look just like my friend.

143
00:09:18,836 --> 00:09:20,336
Sorry if I'm wrong,

144
00:09:20,336 --> 00:09:23,536
but you came to the wedding ceremony of Mr. Taira and Ms. Masudo?

145
00:09:23,536 --> 00:09:24,536
Yes.

146
00:09:24,536 --> 00:09:26,136
Then, all of you as well?

147
00:09:26,136 --> 00:09:27,936
Yeah.

148
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:31,536
It's going to be at the third ceremony hall at 5 o'clock, right?

149
00:09:31,536 --> 00:09:33,636
All right, see you at the hall then.

150
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:37,136
Hey.

151
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:40,736
Good luck, Rei.

152
00:09:40,736 --> 00:09:44,036
Let's see, the third ceremony hall is that way, I think.

153
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:45,936
Hi, Ms. Masudo.

154
00:09:45,936 --> 00:09:47,136
I'm Karube.

155
00:09:47,136 --> 00:09:49,136
Thank you for the invitation.

156
00:09:49,136 --> 00:09:51,136
This is the first time we see each other in person, right?

157
00:09:51,136 --> 00:09:52,336
Yeah.

158
00:09:52,336 --> 00:09:55,236
All right, looking forward to see you at the ceremony hall.

159
00:09:55,236 --> 00:09:58,936
They completely believe that you're Ms. Masudo.

160
00:09:58,936 --> 00:10:00,736
Does she look that much like her?

161
00:10:00,736 --> 00:10:04,336
Maybe it's a sign that you guys are a perfect match.

162
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:06,036
Inspector Shiratori...

163
00:10:06,036 --> 00:10:08,536
Maybe that's why I had that dream this morning.

164
00:10:08,536 --> 00:10:11,836
All right, I don't want you to get into unnecessary trouble.

165
00:10:11,836 --> 00:10:15,236
You guys wait in your room until the ceremony.

166
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:16,236
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

167
00:10:16,236 --> 00:10:19,036
Actually, people are coming in and out of this hall,

168
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:21,136
so why don't you wait in the other room?

169
00:10:21,136 --> 00:10:22,436
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

170
00:10:22,436 --> 00:10:27,736
Now, we should talk to the bride and groom about the situation.

171
00:10:27,736 --> 00:10:28,936
-Yeah, we should. -Yes!

172
00:10:28,936 --> 00:10:30,836
See you later then, Mouri!

173
00:10:30,836 --> 00:10:33,636
Yes, sir! Please be careful!

174
00:10:33,636 --> 00:10:35,836
Hey, why don't you go with them?

175
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:36,936
What?

176
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,536
You're that famous Detective Mouri.

177
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:42,036
You should go and help them.

178
00:10:42,036 --> 00:10:43,536
You're right.

179
00:10:43,536 --> 00:10:46,036
-Hey! Wait, Inspector! -Dad!

180
00:10:46,036 --> 00:10:48,236
-I'm coming, too! -Hey, Conan!

181
00:10:50,436 --> 00:10:52,736
-Excuse me. -Do I know you?

182
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:55,836
I'm sorry. You look just like my friend.

183
00:10:59,236 --> 00:11:00,436
Hey, hey.

184
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:02,736
What are you talking about, Rei?

185
00:11:02,736 --> 00:11:05,436
Today is an important day that we've been working on together.

186
00:11:05,436 --> 00:11:08,136
Please don't say that we should cancel it now.

187
00:11:08,136 --> 00:11:11,736
But, Masateru, somebody is trying to kill us.

188
00:11:11,736 --> 00:11:15,536
What if something happens to the guests we invited here today?

189
00:11:15,536 --> 00:11:18,536
Don't worry. He isn't going to come.

190
00:11:18,536 --> 00:11:20,436
Trust me.

191
00:11:20,436 --> 00:11:21,436
But...

192
00:11:22,836 --> 00:11:24,036
Sorry to intrude.

193
00:11:24,036 --> 00:11:25,336
Inspector.

194
00:11:25,336 --> 00:11:27,436
How is it? Any news?

195
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,736
So far, nothing.

196
00:11:30,736 --> 00:11:35,536
We put our officers on the inside and outside of this hall.

197
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:38,036
Plus, we're going to be with you guys when you move around.

198
00:11:38,036 --> 00:11:39,436
So there's nothing to worry about.

199
00:11:39,436 --> 00:11:41,536
See? You don't need to worry about anything.

200
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:44,436
By the way, who is the gentleman behind you?

201
00:11:45,936 --> 00:11:48,536
He is Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

202
00:11:48,536 --> 00:11:50,136
He just happened to be here today.

203
00:11:50,136 --> 00:11:51,836
Hello.

204
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,336
That famous detective?

205
00:11:53,336 --> 00:11:55,636
So you're the Sleeping Kogoro?

206
00:11:55,636 --> 00:11:57,736
I'll be helping you guys. I'll try my best.

207
00:11:57,736 --> 00:11:59,836
Now, I need you to tell me about the incident

208
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:04,336
that happened six months ago in detail.

209
00:12:04,336 --> 00:12:05,336
All right.

210
00:12:05,336 --> 00:12:07,436
It was a snowy night,

211
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,836
actually midnight, past 12 o'clock.

212
00:12:12,436 --> 00:12:14,436
I woke up as I heard a weird noise.

213
00:12:14,436 --> 00:12:17,636
I tried to turn on the light, but it didn't turn on somehow.

214
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,236
It was weird.

215
00:12:19,236 --> 00:12:21,136
So I went to where the noise was coming from.

216
00:12:25,836 --> 00:12:29,136
The man saw me and tried to attack me with the knife that he had.

217
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:34,936
I ran away desperately in the darkness.

218
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:38,336
But he caught me at the front door.

219
00:12:38,336 --> 00:12:41,236
Seriously, I thought I was going to die.

220
00:12:41,236 --> 00:12:44,236
But my husband came from the front door and saved me.

221
00:12:46,236 --> 00:12:48,336
Actaually, I had a bad feeling that night,

222
00:12:48,336 --> 00:12:50,836
because she told me that her parents were out on a trip,

223
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:55,536
and there were only two elderly servants in her house.

224
00:12:55,536 --> 00:12:59,136
Then, he and the robber started fighting.

225
00:12:59,136 --> 00:13:00,636
Hurry and call the police!

226
00:13:00,636 --> 00:13:03,636
So I went back to my room and called the police.

227
00:13:03,636 --> 00:13:07,936
When I came back, the man was telling Masateru something,

228
00:13:07,936 --> 00:13:09,236
and he ran away.

229
00:13:12,836 --> 00:13:15,836
So that's when he said, "I will never forgive you"?

230
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:19,136
-Yeah. -So, were you both okay?

231
00:13:20,236 --> 00:13:22,936
I didn't have any injury at all,

232
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,636
but he was injured on his left hand.

233
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:26,436
I landed on my left wrist at a bad angle

234
00:13:26,436 --> 00:13:28,636
while struggling with the robber

235
00:13:28,636 --> 00:13:31,736
and I broke my left wrist and thumb.

236
00:13:31,736 --> 00:13:34,536
I actually had a cast on my left arm until last week.

237
00:13:34,536 --> 00:13:38,536
But we should've gone to that place

238
00:13:38,536 --> 00:13:40,536
if we knew that things were going to be like this.

239
00:13:40,536 --> 00:13:42,036
Where is that place?

240
00:13:42,036 --> 00:13:44,536
Her father told her that we should leave Japan for a while

241
00:13:44,536 --> 00:13:47,736
because such a dangerous man was trying to hurt her.

242
00:13:47,736 --> 00:13:51,736
So he bought us a cottage in Hawaii.

243
00:13:53,036 --> 00:13:54,636
That sounds good!

244
00:13:54,636 --> 00:13:57,736
There, we don't need to worry about a robbery like the other one

245
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:01,436
because we got all the security systems in the house.

246
00:14:01,436 --> 00:14:03,336
What do you mean "the other one"?

247
00:14:03,336 --> 00:14:05,336
There was a robbery in your house as well?

248
00:14:05,336 --> 00:14:08,536
Yeah. It was in his house.

249
00:14:08,536 --> 00:14:11,736
It happened while she and I were out.

250
00:14:11,736 --> 00:14:13,836
Anything stolen?

251
00:14:13,836 --> 00:14:15,236
Nothing.

252
00:14:15,236 --> 00:14:17,836
Just that my computer was on after the robbery.

253
00:14:20,136 --> 00:14:21,536
Excuse me.

254
00:14:23,436 --> 00:14:24,936
This is Megure.

255
00:14:24,936 --> 00:14:27,636
Hey, Chiba.

256
00:14:27,636 --> 00:14:30,636
What? There's a burned dead body with the throat slashed?

257
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:31,836
Yes.

258
00:14:31,836 --> 00:14:34,036
It was found in an empty warehouse by Teimuzu River.

259
00:14:34,036 --> 00:14:37,236
It was a man between the age of 30 to 40 years old,

260
00:14:37,236 --> 00:14:39,936
wearing a dark blue suit with a white tie.

261
00:14:39,936 --> 00:14:43,336
I also got important information from the forensic officer just now.

262
00:14:43,336 --> 00:14:45,836
Under his left fingernails...

263
00:14:45,836 --> 00:14:49,336
You found fingerprints from the burglar and serial killer?

264
00:14:50,836 --> 00:14:54,036
A white tie, so it was formal attire.

265
00:14:54,036 --> 00:14:58,936
Hey, did your computer have the guest list for the wedding in it?

266
00:14:58,936 --> 00:15:02,236
Yeah. We made that in his room together.

267
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:05,936
That means the burned dead body could be one of guests on the list.

268
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:08,936
The killer murdered him in order to get the invitation.

269
00:15:08,936 --> 00:15:13,536
So it is possible that the killer is already in this wedding hall.

270
00:15:19,651 --> 00:15:21,651
We have to cancel the wedding.

271
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:24,551
Stop all the weddings in this wedding hall

272
00:15:24,551 --> 00:15:28,651
and get all the people out of here!

273
00:15:28,651 --> 00:15:33,051
I don't want so many people here with a killer on loose.

274
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:36,051
It's best to get everyone out now.

275
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:37,351
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

276
00:15:37,351 --> 00:15:40,351
Hold on a minute, Inspector.

277
00:15:40,351 --> 00:15:42,751
It's a wedding.

278
00:15:42,751 --> 00:15:44,551
You can't just cancel and ruin our important day

279
00:15:44,551 --> 00:15:48,851
without concrete evidence that the killer is here.

280
00:15:48,851 --> 00:15:50,451
But, Mr. Taira,

281
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:52,751
it is likely that you're going to be attacked,

282
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:58,651
because you fought the robber that broke into Ms. Masudo's house.

283
00:15:58,651 --> 00:16:03,951
Also, a blackmail was sent to Ms. Masudo's mailbox two days ago.

284
00:16:03,951 --> 00:16:07,951
And now, we found a burned dead body

285
00:16:07,951 --> 00:16:10,151
with his throat slashed in the warehouse.

286
00:16:10,151 --> 00:16:12,551
Not only the method of homicide was the same,

287
00:16:12,551 --> 00:16:16,951
even the serial killer's fingerprints were also found on the victim's nail.

288
00:16:16,951 --> 00:16:19,851
Not to mention that the victim was dressed in formal wear,

289
00:16:19,851 --> 00:16:22,251
and after someone broke into your apartment,

290
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:26,751
your computer that was off was turned on when you came back.

291
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:31,051
It is reasonable to think that the robber was the serial killer.

292
00:16:31,051 --> 00:16:33,951
He stole the guest list for this wedding from your computer,

293
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,251
called someone on the list

294
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:39,151
and murdered him in order to get the invitation.

295
00:16:39,151 --> 00:16:42,751
And with that invitation, the killer may be here

296
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,951
in this wedding hall right now.

297
00:16:44,951 --> 00:16:49,451
That's right. He's trying to take revenge on you at your ceremony.

298
00:16:49,451 --> 00:16:53,351
But we don't even know if the dead body was one of our guests or not.

299
00:16:56,651 --> 00:17:00,951
Inspector Megure, we got something for the bride and groom.

300
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:03,551
It needs to be opened right now.

301
00:17:05,251 --> 00:17:06,751
What is that?

302
00:17:06,751 --> 00:17:09,051
Who gave you that?

303
00:17:09,051 --> 00:17:12,051
Well, the hall staff gave me this,

304
00:17:12,051 --> 00:17:13,351
so I don't know where this came from.

305
00:17:13,351 --> 00:17:14,651
Hey, hey!

306
00:17:14,651 --> 00:17:17,851
How could you bring such an unidentified thing here in this situation?

307
00:17:17,851 --> 00:17:20,251
Well, but...

308
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,751
Actually, I've checked it already.

309
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:26,751
All right, I see.

310
00:17:26,751 --> 00:17:29,051
Oh, it's from Ms. Shimizu.

311
00:17:29,051 --> 00:17:30,651
You know, our chat friend.

312
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:33,051
Then this must be that video.

313
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:34,651
"Chat friend"?

314
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:39,451
We are into this internet website of hot springs right now.

315
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:42,051
And we're planning to have a party after the ceremony

316
00:17:42,051 --> 00:17:45,351
with the people on the website.

317
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:48,551
And this is the video we are planning to play during the party.

318
00:17:48,551 --> 00:17:51,851
We asked Ms. Shimizu to check it before the party.

319
00:17:51,851 --> 00:17:54,151
I guess she finally finished editing it.

320
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:55,451
Let me take a look.

321
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:59,351
A day with Mr. Taira and Rei.

322
00:17:59,351 --> 00:18:01,751
Last month, Mr. Taira chased a robber out.

323
00:18:01,751 --> 00:18:03,251
Their relationship has become closer and tighter

324
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:04,951
and they have finally got engaged.

325
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:07,451
Now, what does their lovely life look like? Let's take a look.

326
00:18:09,051 --> 00:18:11,651
-What? You came already? -Yes.

327
00:18:11,651 --> 00:18:12,651
Where is this?

328
00:18:12,651 --> 00:18:14,651
-The front door of my apartment. -Wait a second.

329
00:18:14,651 --> 00:18:15,851
I'll get ready real quick, okay?

330
00:18:15,851 --> 00:18:17,251
All right.

331
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:19,251
Is Ms. Shimizu the one shooting this?

332
00:18:19,251 --> 00:18:21,951
Yes. We found out that we live close to each other.

333
00:18:21,951 --> 00:18:23,951
So we became close friends in the real world as well.

334
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,151
Sorry to keep you waiting.

335
00:18:27,551 --> 00:18:30,551
-We're heading to Tropical Land, right? -Yes.

336
00:18:30,551 --> 00:18:32,851
You put your key on the light.

337
00:18:32,851 --> 00:18:34,451
Do you always put it there?

338
00:18:34,451 --> 00:18:36,351
Yes, it's my habit.

339
00:18:36,351 --> 00:18:39,251
That means Ms. Shimizu could pick up the key

340
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,751
and break into your house any time.

341
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:44,151
She's not that kind of person!

342
00:18:44,151 --> 00:18:47,051
She was the one who suggested

343
00:18:47,051 --> 00:18:49,151
that we should report the robbery to the police.

344
00:18:49,151 --> 00:18:53,551
She suggested it? You didn't tell the police about the robbery?

345
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:57,151
Yeah, because nothing was stolen.

346
00:18:58,751 --> 00:18:59,951
But just in case,

347
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:02,951
the date of the wedding was postponed to the next day

348
00:19:02,951 --> 00:19:04,651
than what was written on the list.

349
00:19:04,651 --> 00:19:06,851
Even if the robber broke into my house and saw the list,

350
00:19:06,851 --> 00:19:09,051
he can't come here.

351
00:19:09,051 --> 00:19:14,451
But still, the killer could've called someone from the guest list,

352
00:19:14,451 --> 00:19:16,551
pretending to be your friend

353
00:19:16,551 --> 00:19:19,051
and confirm when the wedding was going to be

354
00:19:19,051 --> 00:19:23,051
or even tell him to come see him, right?

355
00:19:23,051 --> 00:19:29,651
Then, why don't the bride and groom go and see their guests in person?

356
00:19:29,651 --> 00:19:34,651
The bad man may be there pretending to be your friend, right?

357
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:36,351
Right.

358
00:19:36,351 --> 00:19:37,951
Seeing the guests in person?

359
00:19:37,951 --> 00:19:39,751
What if the killer attacks them?

360
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:41,951
Well, seeing them in person maybe impossible,

361
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:46,551
but we can hide in the next room and check them out.

362
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:50,351
That sounds reasonable under this situation.

363
00:19:50,351 --> 00:19:52,351
It's worth trying.

364
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:54,151
We don't want to trigger the killer's criminal act

365
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,951
by cancelling the ceremony all of a sudden.

366
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:57,151
That's true.

367
00:19:57,151 --> 00:19:59,951
Will you please confirm the guests?

368
00:19:59,951 --> 00:20:01,551
Okay.

369
00:20:01,551 --> 00:20:02,951
Sure.

370
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:06,351
Sato, tell Takagi and Yumi

371
00:20:06,351 --> 00:20:10,351
that the killer may already be in this building

372
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:16,151
and that there's a possibility that they are going to be attacked.

373
00:20:16,151 --> 00:20:17,751
Understood.

374
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:19,551
And one more thing, Sato.

375
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,851
You need to stay here to protect the real bride and groom.

376
00:20:22,851 --> 00:20:23,851
Yes, sir!

377
00:20:24,651 --> 00:20:27,351
Masateru, I'm so scared.

378
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,351
Don't worry. I'm with you.

379
00:20:33,751 --> 00:20:36,651
Hey, guys! Look at me!

380
00:20:36,651 --> 00:20:38,651
Tell me, how do I look?

381
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:39,751
Do I look good?

382
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:42,451
Really? Yumi, are you going to get married?

383
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:43,551
Are you kidding me?

384
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:44,751
I'm not going to get married.

385
00:20:44,751 --> 00:20:47,351
It's part of my job!

386
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:49,151
Hey, Yumi.

387
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:51,951
I don't think you should be talking about this mission to outsiders.

388
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:54,151
Yeah, I know that, idiot!

389
00:20:54,151 --> 00:20:56,751
Don't you interrupt my phone conversation, okay?

390
00:20:56,751 --> 00:20:57,851
I'm sorry.

391
00:20:57,851 --> 00:20:59,651
What? That man's voice?

392
00:20:59,651 --> 00:21:01,551
No, it's from the television.

393
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,851
Gosh. She is totally opposite from a while ago.

394
00:21:04,851 --> 00:21:07,851
Girls are so unpredictable.

395
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:11,051
The bride is me!

396
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:14,151
Anyway, why was I having that dream this morning?

397
00:21:14,151 --> 00:21:16,451
I know we are the scapegoat of the bride and groom

398
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:17,851
but we don't have to have a wedding ceremony.

399
00:21:17,851 --> 00:21:19,251
That must be a prophetic dream.

400
00:21:20,251 --> 00:21:21,951
There's a subconscious desire deep inside your head

401
00:21:21,951 --> 00:21:23,551
that you want to marry Kitada.

402
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:26,051
You're just not aware of it yet.

403
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,051
What? That can't be true.

404
00:21:28,051 --> 00:21:29,851
Kitada? Why that nerd?

405
00:21:29,851 --> 00:21:32,951
But people say, "Truth often comes out from lies."

406
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:36,151
I think it's fate that you and Kitada will be together!

407
00:21:37,551 --> 00:21:40,451
Prophetic dream? Subconscious desire?

408
00:21:40,451 --> 00:21:41,851
No way!

409
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:44,751
Ms. Sato.

410
00:21:44,751 --> 00:21:46,751
That's nonsense.

411
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:50,051
There's no such thing as prophetic dreams or subconscious desires.

412
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:51,751
There's no truth behind them.

413
00:21:51,751 --> 00:21:54,051
What are you talking about, Officer Takagi?

414
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:55,451
What are you doing here anyway?

415
00:21:55,451 --> 00:21:57,651
You should be waiting in that room. Inspector told you so, right?

416
00:21:57,651 --> 00:21:59,451
Yeah.

417
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,651
What do you mean by that?

418
00:22:01,651 --> 00:22:03,551
You shouldn't be listening to our conversation!

419
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:04,851
That's right.

420
00:22:04,851 --> 00:22:06,551
Okay. Let's go, Ms. Sato!

421
00:22:06,551 --> 00:22:08,751
Please, stay still.

422
00:22:08,751 --> 00:22:12,651
Why did you have to break your arm just before our wedding?

423
00:22:12,651 --> 00:22:13,851
Ms. Sato.

424
00:22:15,651 --> 00:22:19,551
What is wrong with that couple?

425
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:20,651
Ms. Sato?

426
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,100
How is it?

427
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,800
Well...

428
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,700
Is there anybody that you do not know?

429
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,600
Is there?

430
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,900
Yes.

431
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,650
I have never seen that person.

432
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:05,250
The man with tanned skin, brown hair and sunglasses.

433
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:11,650
And also that skinny man with bobbed hair.

434
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:16,050
And the man with the beard and glasses.

435
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:18,450
That's all.

436
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:22,050
I think the last guy is the most suspicious one.

437
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,950
Huh? Why do you say so, Ran?

438
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,350
Because he was taking pictures of a lot of people

439
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,950
saying that they looked like his friend or something like that.

440
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:36,350
Then he could be my uncle, Uncle Gunji, because he's a photographer.

441
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,350
But you don't know what he looks like, right?

442
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,650
No.

443
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,950
He used to play with me when I was little.

444
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:51,650
Back then, he was much skinnier and had no beard.

445
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,850
But since he started working internationally as a photographer,

446
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,050
I haven't seen him at all.

447
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,550
Then what about the other two?

448
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:02,450
Especially that guy who doesn't take off his sunglasses

449
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,450
even inside the building.

450
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:08,750
Maybe he is my instructor, Mr. Shimabukuro,

451
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,150
who gave me snowboarding lessons before.

452
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,450
I met Masateru at his snowboarding lesson.

453
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,650
That's why we invited him.

454
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:18,850
I see.

455
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:22,950
I quit snowboarding already though.

456
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,150
I think I couldn't recognize him

457
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:27,750
is because his face was always covered with goggles and a hat.

458
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,950
I understand.

459
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,650
Then what about the man with bobbed hair?

460
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,350
All I can think of right now

461
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,950
is that he is the administrator of the hot spring website.

462
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,550
His name is Mr. Karube, I think.

463
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,550
A hot spring website?

464
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,650
Administrator?

465
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:50,950
Inspector, internet sites have administrators.

466
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,750
Of course I know that!

467
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,250
He is very shy that he didn't want to come to a party we had before.

468
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:01,250
We talked to him and finally convinced him to attend our wedding,

469
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,450
so this is the first time we actually got to see him.

470
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:07,250
But that person seemed to know who you were.

471
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,450
He talked to Officer Yumi who was pretending to be you.

472
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:14,150
A few days ago, I sent him a summer gift with my picture in it,

473
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,250
so he should know how I look like.

474
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,050
Inspector.

475
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:22,450
I think we have to call them out, get their fingerprints

476
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:25,350
and see if it matches the serial killer's fingerprint.

477
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,050
No.

478
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:29,650
They came here for our wedding. We can't do that!

479
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:34,050
But there's no other way to find the killer.

480
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:38,650
Hey, how did you figure out that it was the bad man's fingerprints?

481
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:43,350
The criminal is a suspect of four different homicide cases

482
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:47,550
and his fingerprints were found from one of the murder scenes.

483
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:51,850
We found it on the earring the victim was wearing.

484
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,350
There was a piece of gloves on the victim's teeth.

485
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,850
Which tells us that the killer put his left hand on the victim's mouth

486
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:01,350
and stabbed the throat but the victim struggled and bit off the gloves.

487
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,750
The killer then tried to silence the victim with his bare left hand

488
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,450
and that was when he touched her earring.

489
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:09,650
We found the same fingerprints on the cooking knife

490
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,650
that the killer left at Ms. Rei's house.

491
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,250
Not only we got the fingerprints,

492
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,250
but we also got the pattern of his left palm on the knife.

493
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,650
That's how we found

494
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:20,450
the fingerprints on the earring was from the killer's left ring finger.

495
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,750
Inspector, then the killer wasn't wearing gloves

496
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,750
when he broke into Ms. Masudo's house?

497
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,350
No, I heard he was wearing gloves.

498
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:30,550
Maybe he grabbed the cooking knife with his bare hand before he broke in.

499
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,250
The killer didn't leave any of his murder weapons behind

500
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,150
in the first four cases.

501
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:38,650
I guess he didn't think that he would be chased off by Mr. Taira.

502
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,650
So he panicked and forgot to wipe off his fingerprints.

503
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:44,950
Yeah, since no fingerprints were found other than on the cooking knife.

504
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:47,950
Let me ask you, Mr. Taira.

505
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:50,550
Was the front door locked when you came to save Ms. Masudo?

506
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,350
No. It was not locked.

507
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,250
That's because

508
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,650
the house was totally dark,

509
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,750
so I was groping around searching for the front door.

510
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,250
Then I found the door and opened it.

511
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,250
Is there anything wrong?

512
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,450
No. Actually, I think I saw something.

513
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:09,850
What was it? Tell me.

514
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,550
Please remember.

515
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,150
Excuse me, this is not a place for interrogation.

516
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,150
Huh?

517
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,450
What is it, Ran?

518
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,850
Look at those three men.

519
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:25,550
The bobbed hair guy has a bandage on his left pinky and ring finger.

520
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:30,750
The bearded guy with glasses has a Band-Aid on his ring finger.

521
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,850
And the one with sunglasses is keeping his left hand

522
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:35,350
in his pocket all the time.

523
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:40,050
They may be trying to avoid leaving their fingerprints anywhere.

524
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,750
All right then.

525
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,950
Why don't you call them and get their fingerprints or whatever?

526
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:49,650
It will prove whether the killer is here or not.

527
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:53,050
I don't think any of our guests is a criminal though!

528
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:58,450
But Conan is already out there asking around right now.

529
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:03,450
What? Why is that brat always like that?

530
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,250
Mouri.

531
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,450
Now what?

532
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,350
So what happened to their left hand?

533
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,350
The man who had a bandage on said

534
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,250
he sprained his ring finger when he was playing baseball.

535
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:19,550
The one with Band-Aid slammed his hand with the door of his house.

536
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:22,750
The guy with his hand in his pocket said it's just his habit.

537
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:28,650
That's right, he's wearing sunglasses indoors to hide a stye on his eye.

538
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,650
Oh, I remember it now!

539
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,250
I saw it.

540
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,850
I saw it when Masateru came to save me.

541
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,250
It was...

542
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,550
It was a stye that I saw on his right eye!

543
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,150
What?

544
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,650
A stye?

545
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,450
Then the man with sunglasses is the serial killer?

546
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:56,050
But stye usually disappears within a week.

547
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,750
A stye.

548
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:15,550
Now I know who the serial killer is.

549
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,670
What?

550
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:27,670
You're telling me maybe the serial killer is here already?

551
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,070
In this wedding ceremony hall?

552
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,170
Yes.

553
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:34,270
He killed one of the guests in order to get the invitation,

554
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,370
so he can get in here.

555
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:41,670
You guys are the scapegoat for the bride and groom,

556
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,370
you have to be careful.

557
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,670
In fact, I have some other ideas about the suspect as well.

558
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,170
What? Other ideas?

559
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:49,270
-What is it? Is there someone else you can think of? -Hey, Yumi.

560
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,770
I need you to do me a favour.

561
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,570
What is it?

562
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:55,970
Sorry. Takagi, could you leave us for a moment?

563
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,870
It's girl's talk, you know.

564
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,270
Oh, okay!

565
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:05,170
I'll go to the washroom. No, I just went to washroom a while ago.

566
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,570
Anyway, I'm going again.

567
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,470
Of course.

568
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:21,570
I knew it was going to be like this.

569
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,470
So I brought this.

570
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,270
See?

571
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,870
Thanks, Yumi.

572
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:40,170
We can't just judge who the killer is by his face.

573
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:43,570
Well, Ms. Masudo is not sure who those three guys are,

574
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,970
so we should take their fingerprints

575
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:49,770
and see if it matches the killer's before the wedding starts.

576
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,970
Please, you cannot do that.

577
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,170
What if nothing's found?

578
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,670
What if they're all innocent?

579
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,070
I understand,

580
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,370
but the only information we have about the criminal

581
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:02,670
is the fact that he had a stye on his right eye.

582
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,470
But that information can't prove anything

583
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,570
because his stye must have healed since it was six months ago.

584
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:10,570
Don't you remember his voice?

585
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:14,470
You heard him saying "I will never forgive you", right?

586
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:18,470
Yeah. But he was wearing a mask so his voice wasn't that clear.

587
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,470
If the voice left an impression,

588
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:23,470
we would've told you six months ago.

589
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,570
Inspector Megure.

590
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:27,970
The hall staff is saying that we should start the ceremony soon.

591
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,970
I understand. Let's start then.

592
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:32,570
-Hey, hey! -We'll be there soon!

593
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:33,670
Wait!

594
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,070
Hey, you...

595
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,070
Let's go.

596
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,970
Mr. Taira.

597
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:44,970
Mr. Taira!

598
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,170
Regardless, the wedding is still going on no matter what happens.

599
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:51,370
If you guys are still worried, why don't you guys attend our ceremony

600
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,870
and check what's going on?

601
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,170
I really don't expect the killer to show anyway.

602
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,570
Hey, Mr. Taira!

603
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,870
Just leave him now.

604
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:05,570
Let him do whatever he wants to do.

605
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,770
You know we cannot do that.

606
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:09,570
Now, I'll tell you what I think about this case,

607
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,170
but it is up to you whether you believe it or not.

608
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,470
Okay, Inspector Megure?

609
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,970
It is up to you.

610
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,970
Huh? How come nobody is around?

611
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,570
It's Takagi! I'm coming in!

612
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,970
I'm coming in.

613
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,370
What? No way!

614
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,270
No one's here.

615
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,270
What is this?

616
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,670
There you are, Takagi.

617
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:54,470
I just got a call from Inspector Megure.

618
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:58,170
He said you should stay in this room until he tells you what to do.

619
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,670
He really said that? What about Yumi?

620
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:04,470
Oh, Inspector gave her instructions and she left.

621
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,070
Okay.

622
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,170
But where is she going?

623
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:13,270
Now here comes the bride, being escorted by her father.

624
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,770
Please welcome with applause.

625
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:30,970
Wait a minute.

626
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,570
It's been half a year, hasn't it?

627
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,670
My two friends!

628
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,770
That's him!

629
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,770
-Arrest him! -Yes, sir...

630
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,770
Hey! Don't you even think about it!

631
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:47,770
You think I didn't know cops are among those attendants?

632
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:49,070
Don't worry.

633
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:52,070
I'll disappear after cutting these two people into pieces.

634
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,470
Please, no more stupid acting.

635
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,470
Officer?

636
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,470
What are you talking about?

637
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:03,570
I'm the one who broke into that girl's house six months ago!

638
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,170
Are you joking?

639
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,970
You gotta stop this. You look pathetic.

640
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:12,070
There's no way that you are the killer.

641
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,270
How?

642
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:19,070
How do you know that he isn't the killer?

643
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:21,570
What do you mean?

644
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,670
Six months ago,

645
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,670
when you went to Ms. Rei's house and chased the robber off,

646
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,870
the inside of the house was totally dark.

647
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:29,570
That means it was impossible to recognize him by his appearance.

648
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,770
You obviously couldn't know by just looking at him, right?

649
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,270
It's the voice.

650
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,670
Really?

651
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:39,970
I thought you said the killer's voice wasn't distinct enough to identify.

652
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,570
I just saw him a while ago.

653
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:45,070
The police officer who has the same voice as this masked man.

654
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,870
Really? Where did you see him?

655
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:48,870
I don't know.

656
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:51,370
I think it was inside the building.

657
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:53,070
I have to be right.

658
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,370
No one would play such a joke here.

659
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,770
We don't have any friend who would do things like this.

660
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:01,170
You're right. This guy is my subordinate.

661
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,470
But it's weird.

662
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,570
He was by the Teimuzu River

663
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:09,770
and he got here just a minute ago.

664
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,570
It's Officer Chiba.

665
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:13,870
What?

666
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,270
Now, let me ask you again.

667
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:20,370
Why did you think that he was not the serial killer?

668
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,870
Well, that's...

669
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:27,570
Also, tell us why you opened the package you received earlier,

670
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:31,170
without even knowing who it was from.

671
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:36,270
Normally, people wouldn't open it without checking what's inside

672
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:38,170
because there might be some dangerous things in it.

673
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,570
What was your confidence based on?

674
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:43,270
Yes. The confidence that made you think

675
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:46,170
that no dangerous objects would be delivered to you,

676
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:49,270
or no such person as "serial killer" would be coming.

677
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:52,270
I know why you were so confident.

678
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,170
Because you already

679
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:56,370
murdered that serial killer...

680
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:00,270
at the empty warehouse by Teimuzu River.

681
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:05,270
You murdered the serial killer!

682
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,160
Come on! You have to explain it to me!

683
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,760
How come only I have to stay in this dressing room?

684
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,460
Well, they are busy right now.

685
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,760
Then tell me where Yumi and Ms. Sato went.

686
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,960
Just tell me anything.

687
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,460
Sato should be with you right now to protect you.

688
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,460
Well, she's not here.

689
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,360
What? Why not?

690
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,860
That's why I'm asking because I don't see them here.

691
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,460
Hey, we're on a mission right now.

692
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,560
You got to be more serious, Ms. Sato.

693
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,660
What? I murdered the serial killer?

694
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,460
All I said was the serial killer wouldn't come to this wedding

695
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,060
where all the cops are waiting for him.

696
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,660
What does it have to do with murdering him?

697
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,760
You know what?

698
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,160
Before asking me such dumb questions,

699
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,360
you should investigate who those three guys are

700
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,460
because they are people my wife doesn't know.

701
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,160
No. They are clean.

702
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,160
Because all those guys talked to Yumi

703
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,960
whom they thought was Ms. Rei.

704
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,360
I'm sorry. You look just like my friend.

705
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,760
Hi, Ms. Masudo.

706
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,760
Hey.

707
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,560
If one of them murdered and was disguised as the serial killer,

708
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,360
he would have avoided contact with the bride until he takes action.

709
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,360
That's right.

710
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,560
It is too risky to talk to her

711
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,860
because you don't know what the killer said to the bride.

712
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,560
And the bride heard their voice.

713
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,360
They wouldn't know whether she remembers what kind of voice they had.

714
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,160
So if the killer did come here,

715
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,960
he wouldn't want to talk with her too early.

716
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:49,560
Well, we didn't notice it until Mr. Mouri pointed it out.

717
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,860
Then, what about their left ring finger?

718
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,260
They were all hiding it, remember?

719
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,560
It was just a coincidence.

720
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,460
But let's just that say one of them robbed Ms. Masudo's house.

721
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,860
We found the fingerprint on the cooking knife,

722
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,560
but the robber was wearing gloves.

723
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,460
Which means, he touched the knife with his bare hands beforehand.

724
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:10,560
If so, then it is less likely

725
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,360
that they remember which hand touched the cooking knife.

726
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,360
Therefore, they would be hiding both of their hands.

727
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,660
Except you, though.

728
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:20,760
You knew that the police was going to ask you about the fingerprint.

729
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,560
So you lied that you broke your left thumb and wrist

730
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,060
while struggling with the robber,

731
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,360
to hide your left arm with a cast.

732
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,060
That way, you can avoid leaving your fingerprints behind

733
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,860
so the police won't suspect you.

734
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:34,360
You did it because the fingerprint left on that cooking knife was yours.

735
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:39,760
You touched the knife while struggling with the robber.

736
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,960
Also, we found only your left hand fingerprint

737
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,060
because your right hand was holding something.

738
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,160
Do you remember what Ms. Rei said?

739
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,460
She groped her way through the dark house and ran.

740
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,760
But she was caught by the robber at the door.

741
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,760
Then you came to save her

742
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,560
and she saw that the robber had a stye on his right eye.

743
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,860
If she could see a stye on his eye when you came to save her,

744
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:07,360
indicates that you were holding a flashlight at the time.

745
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,260
-That tells me... -That tells me...

746
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,960
that he knew that the electric wiring in her house had been cut

747
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,560
way before he came to save Ms. Masudo.

748
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,760
In conclusion, he was also the robber.

749
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:26,360
Well, luckily, you were fighting the robber on a rug.

750
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,560
Thus, you left only your fingerprint on the cooking knife.

751
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:34,360
Otherwise, your fingerprints may have been on the floor.

752
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,260
The reason why you saved Ms. Rei

753
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:43,260
was because you felt sorry for her while robbing her house, right?

754
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,860
Being betrayed by him,

755
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:49,360
the robber was waiting for the opportunity for his revenge.

756
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,460
But what you did was you let him break into your house,

757
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:56,360
display the old data about the wedding on your computer

758
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,660
and make him believe that the wedding was yesterday.

759
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:02,860
Then you found him wandering around this building yesterday,

760
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,160
trying to take revenge on you.

761
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,360
Saying that you want to apologize,

762
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,860
you took him to the warehouse by Teimuzu River and killed him.

763
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,760
Well, am I wrong?

764
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,360
Yeah, that's almost right.

765
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,860
But the reason I saved this girl

766
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:20,460
was because I could get more money that way than killing her.

767
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,960
You! How could you say that?

768
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,960
I tried to explain it to that fool.

769
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,560
He didn't get it, so I killed him.

770
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,960
All he could do was to open safes. He was a useless man after all.

771
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,860
Yes, that's right.

772
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,560
Just like the police!

773
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,860
Showing a knife in front of a serial killer?

774
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,560
You police are helpless!

775
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,760
Darn it!

776
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,860
Hey, Conan!

777
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,960
Don't even think about it!

778
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,360
Only police officers are here other than the bride's father!

779
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,560
You cannot run away!

780
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,060
Run away?

781
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:04,360
My life's over once my fingerprints are checked.

782
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,360
If so...

783
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,060
I may as well kill as many people as I can with me

784
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,260
to the other side.

785
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,460
Yumi?

786
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,760
Yumi!

787
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,960
Yumi!

788
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,560
Yumi?

789
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,960
Sorry!

790
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,660
I am not Miwako.

791
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,660
But that's Ms. Sato's clothes, right?

792
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,760
Right! We changed!

793
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,360
People didn't notice because I fixed my hair in Japanese style.

794
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,460
You changed your hairstyle?

795
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,260
The reason why I was clinging to you

796
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:44,560
was to make Miwako wants to wear a wedding dress.

797
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,060
She was trying hard to become your bride.

798
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,360
Because she has muscles on her back,

799
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,360
the protective vest could not fit in.

800
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,760
So where's Ms. Sato?

801
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,460
I took her to the ceremony hall as Inspector told me to

802
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,860
but I don't know what happened later.

803
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:01,860
Yumi!

804
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,360
One down.

805
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,360
No way!

806
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,860
Did you know?

807
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:29,060
Corset wires are pretty hard.

808
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,360
Miwako?

809
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,360
Sato?

810
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,660
Get out of my way!

811
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,660
Hey!

812
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,560
I can't use my martial art skills in a wedding dress.

813
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,360
Good!

814
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,260
I forgot.

815
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,060
-Get out of my way, kid! -Conan!

816
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,360
Ran, you gotta stop him!

817
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,260
I had to do that, right?

818
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,160
-I guess so. -Ms. Sato!

819
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,060
Wait!

820
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,260
Ms. Sato.

821
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,760
It's over!

822
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,760
Ms. Sato!

823
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,060
Takagi?

824
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,960
Yeah! I got it!

825
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:44,060
Takagi, why?

826
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,260
Please, don't ask me.

827
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,160
What were you doing, Takagi?

828
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:08,660
Gotta be careful around those ladies. Seriously.

829
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,760
Really? You already realized that the groom was suspicious, Officer Sato?

830
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:44,160
Yeah. It wasn't hard to piece everything together.

831
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,060
I noticed the second I saw the video.

832
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:51,460
Even with his wrist and thumb broken, he was able to change fast.

833
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:56,160
That's why I thought he had a cast on just to hide his fingerprints.

834
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,060
Besides, he hid the fact that his house was broken into.

835
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,560
I see. If he called the police,

836
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:05,360
they will find out that he's the serial killer by his fingerprints.

837
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:09,860
I figured that the bride shouldn't be beside such a dangerous man.

838
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,860
So I became the fake bride instead of Yumi.

839
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:18,860
But you seemed glad to be wearing a wedding dress.

840
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,160
Not really.

841
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,360
I don't look good in that kind of stuff.

842
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,460
Do you think so?

843
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,260
But it was surprising, wasn't it?

844
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:29,460
Who would have thought the beard man was a famous photographer

845
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,560
who made the poster for the wedding hall?

846
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,360
Hey, just hurry past it!

847
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,460
It's so embarrassing. Walk faster, guys!

848
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:41,760
Hurry, hurry!

849
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,060
Go on, Yumi. Go, Takagi.

850
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,960
Come on, everyone.

851
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,460
It was a prophetic dream, but it's over now.

852
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:51,660
Izawa, Yamamoto and Murakoshi...

853
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,660
Okay. Three more people to go.

854
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,560
It's vandalism if you tear it down.

855
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,160
I know that.

856
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,160
What were you thinking, Chiba?

857
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,400
Next Conan's Hint:

858
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,600
"Stage Light"

859
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,100
Which type of wedding ceremony is it?

860
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,640
-Is it a trick or magic? -Are you joking?
