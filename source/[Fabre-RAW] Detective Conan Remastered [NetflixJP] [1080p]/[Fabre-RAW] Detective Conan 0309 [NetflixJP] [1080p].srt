1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,640
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,540
Black entanglement also unravels.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,440
The secret of the men in black is finally at hand.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,740
I will figure out the diary together with Dr. Agasa.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,340
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,760
I have it. It's right here.

9
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:15,160
In my pocket, the clue to those men in the Black Organization.

10
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,060
Now all I have to do is go over to Doc's house

11
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,860
and check this disk thoroughly.

12
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,460
Conan?

13
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,960
I wonder if people change.

14
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,960
If they're apart, will their feelings change?

15
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,060
It's kind of tough

16
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,260
to just keep on waiting.

17
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,960
You don't have to worry about Shinichi.

18
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,060
I think he's just the way you picture him to be, Ran.

19
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,660
So, I don't think you have to worry about him at all.

20
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,760
It would be nice if you were Shinichi, Conan.

21
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,960
How stupid of me, what on earth am I talking about?

22
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,360
Ran, that's not it.

23
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,760
I...

24
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,360
Actually, I am...

25
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,660
No. I can't tell her.

26
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,160
Not until I disclose their identity.

27
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,660
Until I crush them.

28
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,860
I can't tell anybody about me.

29
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,260
You're...

30
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,360
"Contact with the Black Organization (Negotiation Edition)"

31
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,560
So, you're crying again.

32
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,960
Again?

33
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,660
You're always crying.

34
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,960
Always?

35
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,160
Does it bother you?

36
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,160
It's just that you sort of reminded me...

37
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,060
of a girl who resembled you.

38
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,260
A stupid girl who pretended to be composed

39
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,760
but used to cry in private.

40
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,960
Stupid girl?

41
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,960
Hey, Ran.

42
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,960
Do you know that man?

43
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,360
Yes.

44
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,260
I met him when I went to New York with Shinichi.

45
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,360
I was waiting for Shinichi in front of a dilapidated building

46
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,260
when he came walking along

47
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,360
and asked me if I saw a Japanese with long silver dyed hair

48
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,760
and an unshaven face.

49
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,060
Inside that building where the street slasher was hiding?

50
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,460
But, I don't think he's anyone suspicious.

51
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,360
Why?

52
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,760
Because he was together with a person

53
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,060
wearing a jacket with the characters FBI on it.

54
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,560
FBI?

55
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,760
It can't be...

56
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,660
What would the FBI be doing here in Japan?

57
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,560
He's gone.

58
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,060
He's disappeared.

59
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,060
Come on, let's go home, Conan.

60
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,860
Okay.

61
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,860
But, I wonder if he

62
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,860
really belongs to the FBI?

63
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,460
Somebody killed that street slasher

64
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,860
making it look as if he killed himself.

65
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,560
If the FBI had that area covered,

66
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,160
they would never goof like that.

67
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,160
And besides,

68
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,660
during the James kidnap case,

69
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,260
Ai reacted at sensing his presence.

70
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,460
Is it possible he was the one who killed the street slasher?

71
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,460
If he was deeply involved with Ai...

72
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,460
Shuichi Akai.

73
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,260
Don't tell me that his true identity is...

74
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,660
Hey, Conan.

75
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,560
What would you like to eat for dinner?

76
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,860
Sashimi?

77
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,560
Tenshin rice?

78
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,060
Or beef stew?

79
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,860
But, choose only one of the dishes...

80
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,860
Huh?

81
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,860
Conan?

82
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,760
"I promised Dr. Agasa that I would play a game with him,

83
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,660
so I'm going to sleep over at his place tonight."

84
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,560
Playing games again?

85
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,760
I tell you, he's so childish.

86
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,560
More important than Shuichi Akai now

87
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,760
is the diary that's inside this disc.

88
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,460
The diary of Mr. Itakura, who met Tequila,

89
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,560
one of the members of the men in black, 2 years ago.

90
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,760
I'm going to check it thoroughly

91
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,160
and figure out their purpose,

92
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,260
as well as their identity.

93
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,660
Shinichi, great timing.

94
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,160
It's been a while, but I've invented something new again.

95
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,560
While I was at it, I also made you another pair of pursuit glasses,

96
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,360
so you won't have to worry about running out of batteries.

97
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,260
By the way, where's Ai?

98
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,960
Ai's taking a bath right now.

99
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,060
That's just great.

100
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,360
Hey, Shinichi. What do you mean that's just great?

101
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,560
Don't tell me that you're going to take a peek?

102
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,760
Oh, come on.

103
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,660
What? You got hold of clues to those guys?

104
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,360
Shinichi, you're not pulling my leg, are you?

105
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,660
No.

106
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,060
If Ai finds out, it may cause her needless worry,

107
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,860
so I've got to check things out while she's not around.

108
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,460
Let me see, two years ago.

109
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,360
Two years ago...

110
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,260
There. This is it.

111
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,760
"March 7th, a man with a Kansai dialect suddenly came to see me.

112
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,160
It seems that he was after a system software

113
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,260
which was under development,

114
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,760
but as soon as he found out that my vision had gone bad

115
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,560
and I gave up the development, he left.

116
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,260
This man was dressed in black from head to toe.

117
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,060
I never want to see him again."

118
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,060
Hey, is this it?

119
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,060
There seems to be nothing more written about the big man

120
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,060
in the diary in the days following either.

121
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,860
Seriously. And I went through all the trouble to get a hold of this diary.

122
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,260
The only thing I found out

123
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,760
was that Mr. Itakura was developing some kind of software,

124
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,760
and that they wanted it.

125
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,960
This Itakura guy sure must've been some unreliable character.

126
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,560
Look, the space between the written and unwritten pages of the book

127
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,160
is disorganized.

128
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,460
If it were me,

129
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,960
I wouldn't be able to stand not placing everything in order.

130
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,560
Come to think of it, he said back then,

131
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,360
that Mr. Itakura would get upset

132
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,960
even if his papers were moved 10 centimeters out of place.

133
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,360
Wrong, Dr. Agasa.

134
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,460
The space between the pages is not disorganized.

135
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,560
Watch, okay?

136
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,160
You place the cursor on the open space like this

137
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,360
and drag the mouse along, then, highlight it.

138
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,360
This is...

139
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,560
I'm pooped.

140
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,460
If this keeps up, I'll probably be killed one day.

141
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,860
"Invisible writing".

142
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,260
It's a method that's frequently used

143
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,960
when people want to hide

144
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,160
what is written on things like the internet website.

145
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,760
But, why would Mr. Itakura do something like this to his own diary?

146
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,560
Probably as camouflage just in case

147
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,260
somebody snuck a look at his diary.

148
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,260
Shinichi, don't tell me that the person is...

149
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,560
Yes, I'm sure he didn't want them to see it.

150
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,580
Dr. Agasa.

151
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,980
I finished taking a bath.

152
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,980
Dr. Agasa?

153
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,080
It seems that he's started using invisible writing

154
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,280
10 days after the big man came.

155
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,780
It goes on to say,

156
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,180
"March 16th.

157
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,180
The pen of my desk has been moved another 5 centimeters.

158
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,280
It seems that someone's been sneaking into my office after all.

159
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,480
April 15th. Somebody has snuck into my house this time.

160
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,480
The police won't take it seriously.

161
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,080
I guess it couldn't be helped

162
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,980
because there were no traces of a break-in or anything being taken.

163
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,780
June 11th.

164
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,680
I changed the locks and set up hidden surveillance cameras,

165
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,880
but to no avail.

166
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,380
July 6th. Who is it? Show yourself.

167
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,880
November 19th. I'm pooped.

168
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,980
If this keeps up, I'll probably be killed one day.

169
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,180
January 6th. In order to free me from this terror,

170
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,680
I inserted a message addressed to the intruder in the desk.

171
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,080
I wrote that I would go along with their demand.

172
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,580
January 8th. I got an answer earlier than expected.

173
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,780
In place of the message I inserted,

174
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,480
there was a memo from the intruder.

175
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,180
"OK" was written in red.

176
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,480
Along with a mysterious phone number was written.

177
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,680
The red words were probably written with blood.

178
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,480
It probably means, "Tell no one or you're dead".

179
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,780
January 23rd.

180
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,080
Although I was deliberating on what to do for a while,

181
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,480
I decided not to notify the police and call them instead.

182
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,780
To my surprise, a woman answered the phone.

183
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,580
A stuck up woman who talked as if she were a queen.

184
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,580
Her request was that she wanted to buy the software

185
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,280
that I was developing at a high price

186
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,580
if I could finish making it in a year.

187
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,980
I guess she's a member of the same group

188
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,480
as the big man that previously came to see me.

189
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,780
February 13th.

190
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,880
Their way of contacting me changed to e-mail.

191
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,880
I decided to accept the offer under the condition

192
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,480
that they deposit the payment into my account in advance

193
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,980
and that they stop snooping around me anymore.

194
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,380
December 22nd.

195
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,180
No good.

196
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,680
I can't do it after all.

197
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,380
I abandoned making that software

198
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,380
not only because my vision started weakening,

199
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,880
but for the sake of mankind."

200
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,280
For the sake of mankind?

201
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,880
"February 9th.

202
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,980
The deadline is drawing near.

203
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,080
I have decided to hide the unfinished software

204
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,880
and the check of the payment they made to me

205
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,180
near the computer of my villa

206
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,780
and escape abroad.

207
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,980
The e-mail with instructions

208
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,480
as to the time and place of where the software

209
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
will be handed over to them

210
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,280
should be arriving 5 days later at midnight.

211
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,180
I'll try to somehow make it abroad by then."

212
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,680
The date on this diary is four days ago,

213
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,380
which means the e-mail should be arriving 3 hours from now at 9 pm.

214
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,480
I guess Mr. Itakura was planning to escape abroad

215
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,080
before seeing that e-mail.

216
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,780
There seems to be invisible writing even after the last day.

217
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,880
"February 10th.

218
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,880
I wonder what they're going to do with that software?

219
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,580
The queer words of that woman who first answered the phone

220
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,880
won't leave my ears.

221
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,580
Yes. I couldn't stand the overbearing tone of voice of the woman

222
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,580
so I taunted her saying, "Just who the hell do you think you are?"

223
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,280
She laughed and replied,

224
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,180
"We can be both of God and the Devil,

225
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,580
since we're trying to raise the dead

226
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,780
against the stream of time."

227
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,180
What?

228
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,580
We can be both of God and the Devil,

229
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,080
since we're...

230
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,880
We're trying to raise the dead against the stream of time.

231
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,780
-Ai? -Ai?

232
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,580
What is that?

233
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,680
Are you reading some kind of fantasy story

234
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,580
where a witch or something appears?

235
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,880
Yes, exactly.

236
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,980
I'm hooked on this internet series of western novels, you see.

237
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,980
And you? What are you doing here, Shinichi?

238
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,280
Oh, me?

239
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,780
I was...

240
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,680
He came to try out my new invention.

241
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,080
Right?

242
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,180
Yes.

243
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,980
This is called "Fire a ball anywhere belt".

244
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,080
It looks like any ordinary belt at first glance.

245
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,580
No, it doesn't.

246
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,080
But when you adjust the dial and push the button.

247
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,480
There. One soccer ball to go.

248
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,380
That's amazing!

249
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,480
I'd be able to catch a load of culprits with this.

250
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,980
No, maybe just one or two.

251
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,380
Because of the nature of rubber,

252
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,480
once it leaves the belt,

253
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,780
it can only maintain its form for 10 seconds.

254
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,380
I see.

255
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,880
However, it is very elastic.

256
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,580
Depending on the amount of gas that's put in,

257
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,880
it can become as large as an advertisement balloon.

258
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,680
Oh, that's some value.

259
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,580
Sounds silly.

260
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,380
I'm going to go to bed.

261
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,880
So, what now?

262
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,080
What else?

263
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,880
We're going to Mr. Itakura's villa right now

264
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,080
and get a hold of that system software in question.

265
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,880
Then, we're going to receive the e-mail

266
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,680
that they're going to be sending at midnight.

267
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,080
It's amazing how you found out

268
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,180
that Mr. Itakura's villa is in Gunma.

269
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,080
Pops asked the man from the game company

270
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,280
that came to ask him to look for Mr. Itakura.

271
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,280
He was asking the man for places

272
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,880
that Mr. Itakura could be hiding like his house,

273
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,380
villa, the addresses of his acquaintances and so forth.

274
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,480
Will it be okay though?

275
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,680
What if they're waiting in ambush or something?

276
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,380
We'll be fine.

277
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,080
Mr. Itakura made them promise

278
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,180
not to snoop around him anymore.

279
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,680
They would never break a promise with a character

280
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,380
who is so jittery that he was bothered

281
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,180
that the pen on his desk had been moved 5 centimeters.

282
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,080
I think you have a point.

283
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,180
If they upset him before the software is completed,

284
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,880
they'll be throwing everything down the drain.

285
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,980
The problem is, whether the news about Mr. Itakura being killed

286
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,380
has already been aired on TV or radio.

287
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,880
Even so, it'll be okay.

288
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,180
I've been listening to the radio all this time,

289
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,980
but all they're broadcasting

290
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,380
is about the jewelry robber who is on the run.

291
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,580
The thing that bothers me though, are the last words in the diary.

292
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,680
Yes.

293
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,580
"We can be both of God and the Devil,

294
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:26,180
since we are trying to raise the dead against the stream of time."

295
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,180
What does it mean anyway?

296
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,580
Hey, Dr. Agasa.

297
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,080
Don't tell me that the drug Ai was trying to make was...

298
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,680
No way. Making zombies. That's ridiculous.

299
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,880
Don't rush things.

300
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,980
People cannot go against the stream of time.

301
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,780
If people try to bend things out of line by force,

302
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,180
they will be punished.

303
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,880
What is it?

304
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,880
What is the punishment?

305
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,480
We've finally arrived.

306
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,480
Now, how do we make it inside?

307
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,080
Well...

308
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,580
Where did you get that key?

309
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,580
It was hidden behind those stairs.

310
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,580
Remember it was written in the diary?

311
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:25,380
"A friend that I haven't seen in 5 years called me from my villa."

312
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,580
Which means that the key was hidden somewhere

313
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,880
so that his friends could come in whenever they wanted to.

314
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,880
I see.

315
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,580
But, how dangerous.

316
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,180
He left it here just for that very reason.

317
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,580
Because they wouldn't think that the software that they wanted

318
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,880
would be left so carelessly in a place like this.

319
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,580
And as for the e-mail that they are about to send here,

320
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,180
if no one receives their mail here,

321
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,480
they'll eventually come here to look for Mr. Itakura,

322
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,280
and find the software and the check,

323
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,380
so he gets to sever all ties with them without having to see them.

324
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,580
Shinichi, it's almost time.

325
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,580
Yes.

326
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:12,180
Come on, you guys in black.

327
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,680
Show your dirty rat selves.

328
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,780
Here it is. The mail.

329
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,080
Okay, if I open this...

330
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,480
Password?

331
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,580
Hey, it's counting down really fast.

332
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,180
Darn.

333
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,680
The mail disappeared.

334
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,280
Darn. It was set so that if it wasn't opened immediately,

335
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,480
it would disappear.

336
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,680
So, don't tell me that they found out the mail wasn't opened?

337
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,780
Yes. Not only that, maybe they even found out

338
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,580
that the mail failed to be opened using this computer.

339
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,880
What now?

340
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,980
They may think that something happened to Mr. Itakura

341
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,780
and come here.

342
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,380
Shinichi?

343
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,980
Shinichi?

344
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,880
I can't come to the phone right now.

345
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:22,380
Please record your message after the tone.

346
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,580
Hey, what's going on?

347
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,480
Vodka?

348
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,280
You're there, aren't you?

349
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,980
They've found out.

350
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,380
They've found out that we failed to open the e-mail.

351
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,380
Yes. Or maybe they were watching this villa...

352
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,980
without Mr. Itakura being aware that they were.

353
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,280
What?

354
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,480
I'm counting on them not thinking

355
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,080
that Mr. Itakura would receive their mail

356
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,380
in an unsafe place like this, though.

357
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,380
Hey. If so, how are we going to escape?

358
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,380
We're trapped.

359
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,580
Hey, answer me.

360
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,780
I know you're at that villa.

361
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,280
Shinichi?

362
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,580
Hurry up and answer me,

363
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,180
Mr. Itakura.

364
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,580
Hey. What's going on?

365
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,580
Can't you hear me?

366
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,680
Hey!

367
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,040
Next Conan's Hint:

368
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,040
"System Software"
