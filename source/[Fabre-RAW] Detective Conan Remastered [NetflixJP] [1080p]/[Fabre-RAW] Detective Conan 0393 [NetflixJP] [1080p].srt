1
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,122
Abduction and ransom.

2
00:00:24,122 --> 00:00:25,622
Money is usually the objective,

3
00:00:25,622 --> 00:00:27,822
but something is strange about today's incident.

4
00:00:27,822 --> 00:00:29,322
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,322 --> 00:00:31,122
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,122 --> 00:00:33,722
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:15,118
2:30 is the time that I get sleepy.

8
00:02:22,718 --> 00:02:24,418
What happened?

9
00:02:25,518 --> 00:02:28,818
-Call the police! -Ambulance! Call an ambulance.

10
00:02:33,118 --> 00:02:35,618
There's no need to call an ambulance.

11
00:02:35,618 --> 00:02:36,918
He died on the spot.

12
00:02:36,918 --> 00:02:38,618
He was going at tremendous speed.

13
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:41,118
He couldn't possibly have controlled the wheels at the speed he was going.

14
00:02:49,118 --> 00:02:50,918
What's with this load of cash?

15
00:02:50,918 --> 00:02:52,018
Unreal.

16
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:54,518
Huh? There seems to be a letter inside.

17
00:02:54,518 --> 00:02:55,918
Give it to me!

18
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:00,418
"Here is 30,000,000 yen. I haven't contact the police.

19
00:03:00,418 --> 00:03:03,918
Please return my father right away. Domoto."

20
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:06,318
Which means that this money is...

21
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,318
Ransom that was prepared to get back a hostage.

22
00:03:11,518 --> 00:03:17,218
"A Mock Kidnap... Case"

23
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:29,718
The name of the man who died is Takeshi Hirano.

24
00:03:29,718 --> 00:03:32,318
He has a record of being arrested for threatening and taking cash.

25
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:34,718
He's on the kidnappers side for sure.

26
00:03:34,718 --> 00:03:38,118
I wonder if he was on his way back after taking the ransom money?

27
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:41,118
If Hirano alone committed this crime,

28
00:03:41,118 --> 00:03:42,518
we've got trouble.

29
00:03:42,518 --> 00:03:46,718
Nobody knows where the kidnapped person is being confined.

30
00:03:46,718 --> 00:03:48,618
On top of that, we don't have time.

31
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:52,718
"My father has kidney ailment.

32
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:55,118
He needs medication every six hours.

33
00:03:55,118 --> 00:03:59,118
I've enclose it, so please administer it to him."

34
00:04:00,818 --> 00:04:04,118
It means that the hostage will not get this medication.

35
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:06,218
Unless we hurry and find the hostage.

36
00:04:06,218 --> 00:04:09,118
But where is he being confined?

37
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:13,318
First, we've got to find out who the hostage is.

38
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:16,618
We know his last name is Domoto but Domoto of where?

39
00:04:16,618 --> 00:04:18,718
Maybe he was visiting a hospital

40
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:19,918
to get his medicine.

41
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:29,818
This is Beika Electric Company.

42
00:04:29,818 --> 00:04:31,718
We've come to deliver the TV set you ordered.

43
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:34,118
I haven't ordered it.

44
00:04:34,118 --> 00:04:35,918
Maybe it's some mistake?

45
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:38,918
No. It's no mistake.

46
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:41,418
Please verify the order form.

47
00:04:43,218 --> 00:04:45,418
We did not order any TV set.

48
00:04:50,718 --> 00:04:52,718
We're the police.

49
00:04:52,718 --> 00:04:54,318
Dear.

50
00:04:54,318 --> 00:04:55,718
The police?

51
00:04:55,718 --> 00:04:57,518
Hey, long time no see!

52
00:04:57,518 --> 00:04:59,018
Remember I was an upperclassman at the same university?

53
00:04:59,018 --> 00:05:00,418
It's me, me.

54
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:02,018
And I'm his son!

55
00:05:02,018 --> 00:05:04,018
How do you do?

56
00:05:04,018 --> 00:05:06,718
How come you're here, too?

57
00:05:06,718 --> 00:05:08,918
You'll look less suspicious with a child, right?

58
00:05:11,318 --> 00:05:12,618
This is a kidnap case, isn't it?

59
00:05:12,618 --> 00:05:14,018
Yes.

60
00:05:15,718 --> 00:05:17,418
Our father...

61
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:19,918
We matched the "Domotos"

62
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,518
that live within Tokyo and visit the hospital for kidney ailment,

63
00:05:23,518 --> 00:05:26,718
and came up with your father.

64
00:05:26,718 --> 00:05:30,218
Mr. Shozo Domoto, who goes to the Beika Central Hospital.

65
00:05:30,218 --> 00:05:31,518
But why?

66
00:05:31,518 --> 00:05:33,618
We were told that if we report this to the police, father would be killed.

67
00:05:35,618 --> 00:05:37,718
The situation has changed.

68
00:05:37,718 --> 00:05:39,618
Why does the police have this?

69
00:05:39,618 --> 00:05:42,318
We left it where we were told to leave it.

70
00:05:42,318 --> 00:05:46,918
That culprit passed away of a traffic accident while on his motorbike.

71
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:49,018
The culprit?

72
00:05:49,018 --> 00:05:51,318
Please don't give up.

73
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:54,018
We are tracing the friends of this man.

74
00:05:54,018 --> 00:05:55,418
We're hoping to find the place

75
00:05:55,418 --> 00:05:57,418
where your father is being confined from the hints we may get from them.

76
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:00,718
To think that this did not reach father.

77
00:06:00,718 --> 00:06:03,118
It says every six hours,

78
00:06:03,118 --> 00:06:05,818
but when is the last time your father was injected?

79
00:06:05,818 --> 00:06:07,318
At 9:00 this morning.

80
00:06:07,318 --> 00:06:09,318
Which means the next shot...

81
00:06:10,618 --> 00:06:12,018
has to be given to him at 3:00 in the afternoon.

82
00:06:12,018 --> 00:06:13,818
It's way past time!

83
00:06:16,018 --> 00:06:17,018
Inspector.

84
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:22,518
It's not that he's going to fall into serious condition right away,

85
00:06:22,518 --> 00:06:25,618
but if there is a time span of more than eight hours...

86
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:28,318
The limit is eight hours, which means...

87
00:06:28,318 --> 00:06:30,318
The time limit is 5:00 in the afternoon.

88
00:06:30,318 --> 00:06:32,118
There's only an hour and a half left.

89
00:06:34,218 --> 00:06:37,518
Please tell us when and in what way your father was kidnapped,

90
00:06:37,518 --> 00:06:39,418
as well as how you coped with the situation.

91
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:41,918
The more in detail the better.

92
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:44,318
There are four of us living here.

93
00:06:44,318 --> 00:06:47,618
Shosaburo Domoto, my father who runs a metal processing company,

94
00:06:47,618 --> 00:06:49,918
his only daughter, me,

95
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:51,818
my husband Akinori

96
00:06:51,818 --> 00:06:55,418
and our housekeeper, Masayo.

97
00:06:55,418 --> 00:06:58,518
Today is the company's establishment day, so it was closed.

98
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,018
That's why everyone was at home from morning.

99
00:07:01,018 --> 00:07:04,218
I'm also working at father's company.

100
00:07:04,218 --> 00:07:06,918
You have married into your wife's family.

101
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:08,618
And will eventually become the heir.

102
00:07:13,218 --> 00:07:15,918
I injected father at 9:00 in the morning,

103
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:18,318
and went to visit a friend of mine.

104
00:07:22,218 --> 00:07:26,118
I had promised to go see her from sometime before.

105
00:07:27,218 --> 00:07:29,518
After that, father went out for a walk.

106
00:07:29,518 --> 00:07:31,818
He always does on his days off.

107
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:35,118
And at about 10:00, I went into my study

108
00:07:35,118 --> 00:07:37,318
because I had some documents I had to get together.

109
00:07:40,818 --> 00:07:44,718
At about 11:00, when I was cleaning the bath tub, the phone rang.

110
00:07:44,718 --> 00:07:46,618
It was the voice of a young man.

111
00:07:46,618 --> 00:07:48,318
Get one of the family members on the phone.

112
00:07:50,418 --> 00:07:52,718
This is Domoto speaking.

113
00:07:52,718 --> 00:07:54,618
What? Kidnap?

114
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:58,418
In other words, Mr. Shosaburo Domoto was kidnapped

115
00:07:58,418 --> 00:08:03,718
while taking a walk between the hours of 09:00 to 11:00.

116
00:08:08,518 --> 00:08:11,418
When he takes a walk, does he always walk the same course?

117
00:08:11,418 --> 00:08:13,218
Yes, it's almost always the same.

118
00:08:13,218 --> 00:08:15,118
Can you tell me about where it is?

119
00:08:15,118 --> 00:08:18,118
There could be a hint leading to the place of confinement.

120
00:08:20,318 --> 00:08:21,518
I'll go look.

121
00:08:24,818 --> 00:08:27,818
I called and told her to come home right away.

122
00:08:29,518 --> 00:08:31,818
I'll do everything I can to get together the ransom of 30,000,000 yen

123
00:08:31,818 --> 00:08:35,218
that is being demanded, so don't worry.

124
00:08:35,218 --> 00:08:38,518
As long as we give them the money, father will be all right.

125
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,918
Leave it to me.

126
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:43,318
I'm counting on you, Akinari!

127
00:08:54,018 --> 00:08:56,218
Now, everything will be okay.

128
00:08:56,218 --> 00:08:58,418
Thank you, Akinari.

129
00:09:03,218 --> 00:09:05,518
Hello.

130
00:09:05,518 --> 00:09:07,618
Yes, the ransom...

131
00:09:20,618 --> 00:09:24,418
"I'll return the hostage as soon as I confirm the cash, so wait at home."

132
00:09:24,418 --> 00:09:27,018
I believed what he told me.

133
00:09:27,018 --> 00:09:30,918
I even enclosed the medicine just in case, too.

134
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:34,618
5:00. Only one more hour to go before the time limit.

135
00:09:34,618 --> 00:09:37,818
Don't cry. I know father's going to come back safely.

136
00:09:37,818 --> 00:09:40,618
Yes, we'd like to pray that he's okay,

137
00:09:40,618 --> 00:09:42,418
regardless of how we usually feel about him.

138
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:54,118
Uncle Kogoro told me to ask you.

139
00:09:54,118 --> 00:09:55,118
What did you mean when you said,

140
00:09:55,118 --> 00:09:57,118
"regardless of how we usually feel about him" a while ago?

141
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:59,218
Well...

142
00:09:59,218 --> 00:10:04,518
Akinari always had it tough with Mr. Domoto.

143
00:10:04,518 --> 00:10:06,318
Had it tough?

144
00:10:07,618 --> 00:10:08,918
Of all things,

145
00:10:08,918 --> 00:10:12,318
I feel no ambition or spirit from you at all.

146
00:10:12,318 --> 00:10:16,318
I'm trying the best I can for the company, too.

147
00:10:17,318 --> 00:10:20,518
You're just not cut out to take after me.

148
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:22,618
Just looking at you makes me lose my appetite.

149
00:10:23,818 --> 00:10:24,918
Father!

150
00:10:26,118 --> 00:10:28,118
Mr. Domoto is strict to the point

151
00:10:28,118 --> 00:10:31,018
that it makes you wonder why he's so hard on Akinari.

152
00:10:31,018 --> 00:10:34,118
But his wife protects him at times like these, right?

153
00:10:34,118 --> 00:10:39,518
When they first got married, they really got along well.

154
00:10:39,518 --> 00:10:41,918
But recently, even Mrs. Domoto...

155
00:10:43,318 --> 00:10:45,318
Aren't you vexed?

156
00:10:45,318 --> 00:10:49,318
Making him talk that way about you. Be a man!

157
00:10:49,318 --> 00:10:52,418
Mitsuko, why are you acting like this?

158
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:56,218
I wonder if it's her father's influence?

159
00:10:56,218 --> 00:10:59,618
But him being kidnapped is another story.

160
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:03,918
Even Akinari will worry about him and hope that he is safe.

161
00:11:03,918 --> 00:11:07,818
That's why he gathered the ransom with all his might.

162
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:13,318
I guess so.

163
00:11:13,318 --> 00:11:15,518
This has nothing to do with the kidnapping.

164
00:11:19,118 --> 00:11:20,718
It's me.

165
00:11:20,718 --> 00:11:22,818
According to a friend who goes around with Takeshi Hirano,

166
00:11:22,818 --> 00:11:26,418
he says that Hirano seemed to have a lot of money on him since a week ago.

167
00:11:26,418 --> 00:11:30,218
Which means that Hirano was hired and paid by someone.

168
00:11:32,418 --> 00:11:33,518
Probably.

169
00:11:33,518 --> 00:11:36,418
But I haven't got info on who hired him yet.

170
00:11:36,418 --> 00:11:38,518
So, you don't know who it is yet.

171
00:11:38,518 --> 00:11:41,118
Continue asking around his friends and acquaintances.

172
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,818
If only we can find who it is,

173
00:11:42,818 --> 00:11:44,918
we may get a hint on where Mr. Domoto is being confined.

174
00:11:44,918 --> 00:11:47,718
There's another mastermind behind this.

175
00:11:47,718 --> 00:11:49,818
But if so, something is odd.

176
00:11:49,818 --> 00:11:51,118
Something's strange, isn't it, Inspector?

177
00:11:51,118 --> 00:11:52,218
What is?

178
00:11:52,218 --> 00:11:53,518
The mastermind.

179
00:11:53,518 --> 00:11:57,518
The guy who went to get the ransom hasn't come back for a while.

180
00:11:57,518 --> 00:11:59,118
Therefore, wouldn't he normally call to demand

181
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,818
what happened to the money, saying,

182
00:12:00,818 --> 00:12:04,218
"What happened to the money? Are going to leave the hostage to die?"

183
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:06,218
I see. Now that you mentioned it.

184
00:12:06,218 --> 00:12:07,718
Exactly.

185
00:12:07,718 --> 00:12:10,018
Why does the mastermind seem quite indifferent to the money

186
00:12:10,018 --> 00:12:12,518
after having demanded it?

187
00:12:16,218 --> 00:12:17,418
Father!

188
00:12:17,418 --> 00:12:18,418
Mitsuko.

189
00:12:18,418 --> 00:12:21,618
Maybe the real purpose of this kidnapping is...

190
00:12:27,118 --> 00:12:28,918
I see.

191
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:30,718
If so...

192
00:12:30,718 --> 00:12:33,418
Oh, my. What is it now, kid?

193
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:37,718
Mr. Akinari Domoto was in his study all morning today, right?

194
00:12:37,718 --> 00:12:39,418
Yes, he had work to do.

195
00:12:39,418 --> 00:12:42,018
Did he say something to you back then?

196
00:12:42,018 --> 00:12:43,418
Something?

197
00:12:43,418 --> 00:12:45,318
Well...

198
00:12:45,318 --> 00:12:48,618
Masayo, I'm going to concentrate on work for a while.

199
00:12:48,618 --> 00:12:51,018
So you don't have to bring me tea or anything.

200
00:12:51,018 --> 00:12:52,818
Just as I thought.

201
00:12:52,818 --> 00:12:53,918
If so...

202
00:13:10,418 --> 00:13:11,518
Machine oil.

203
00:13:22,118 --> 00:13:23,518
No doubt about it.

204
00:13:23,518 --> 00:13:26,218
I figured out who the real culprit of this kidnapping case is.

205
00:13:26,218 --> 00:13:27,218
But I know that the person will play dumb

206
00:13:27,218 --> 00:13:29,018
even if I try to pressure him for a confession.

207
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:30,818
And the time limit will eventually come.

208
00:13:32,218 --> 00:13:37,018
That's the real purpose behind all this, not the ransom.

209
00:13:37,018 --> 00:13:39,518
It's 4:30, only 30 minutes more to go.

210
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:42,318
Where is the place the hostage is confined?

211
00:13:48,216 --> 00:13:51,116
Hey, kid. What're you doing staring at a map?

212
00:13:52,116 --> 00:13:55,516
I was just wondering where the motorbike was headed for.

213
00:13:55,516 --> 00:13:58,916
Where? The hideout where the hostage is confined.

214
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:02,616
That's why from the place he picked up the ransom in Beika Park,

215
00:14:02,616 --> 00:14:04,616
to the scene of the accident, over here.

216
00:14:04,616 --> 00:14:05,816
If you draw a line beyond it is...

217
00:14:06,816 --> 00:14:08,216
Most likely.

218
00:14:08,216 --> 00:14:09,916
But Conan...

219
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:14,616
But you can't tell if it's 10 or 100 kilometres away.

220
00:14:14,616 --> 00:14:17,416
Huh? There's a place with the same name as this house.

221
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,816
Huh?

222
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,516
Domoto Metal Processing?

223
00:14:21,616 --> 00:14:24,116
That's our factory.

224
00:14:24,116 --> 00:14:27,916
But since we moved and built a new one in East Beika six months ago,

225
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,716
it's closed down now.

226
00:14:29,716 --> 00:14:31,616
Which means it's not in use anymore.

227
00:14:31,616 --> 00:14:35,516
So nobody is there or will come there anymore.

228
00:14:35,516 --> 00:14:37,916
Inspector, it's the ideal place for confining someone.

229
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,116
Very probable.

230
00:14:40,116 --> 00:14:41,216
Conan, give me the map.

231
00:14:41,216 --> 00:14:42,816
Yes, sir!

232
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:45,216
Then, father is in that factory?

233
00:14:45,216 --> 00:14:48,016
There's a possibility he is.

234
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:50,816
There's only 15 more minutes left.

235
00:14:50,816 --> 00:14:54,816
Mrs. Domoto, please don't give up until the end.

236
00:14:54,816 --> 00:14:56,316
Pops, great phrase.

237
00:14:57,316 --> 00:15:00,116
Please hold up for another 15 minutes.

238
00:15:08,216 --> 00:15:10,916
Stop. Time, please stop.

239
00:15:12,016 --> 00:15:13,216
Father.

240
00:15:24,616 --> 00:15:26,116
Give it to me, I'll open it.

241
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,316
Father!

242
00:15:32,316 --> 00:15:33,816
-Mr. Domoto! -Mr. Domoto!

243
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:41,916
Father!

244
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:42,916
Father.

245
00:15:51,516 --> 00:15:56,316
Father!

246
00:15:56,316 --> 00:15:57,516
He's still breathing!

247
00:15:58,616 --> 00:16:00,116
This is Takagi.

248
00:16:00,116 --> 00:16:01,316
Please send an ambulance over.

249
00:16:01,316 --> 00:16:02,516
The location is...

250
00:16:10,716 --> 00:16:13,016
Mr. Domoto, get a hold of yourself!

251
00:16:19,616 --> 00:16:22,416
Your wife will head for the hospital.

252
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,316
You go, too.

253
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,616
Yes, sir.

254
00:16:28,816 --> 00:16:30,916
Please wait, Mr. Domoto.

255
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,116
Why?

256
00:16:34,116 --> 00:16:35,816
He's transformed into the Sleeping Koori!

257
00:16:35,816 --> 00:16:37,216
Mr. Mouri?

258
00:16:40,116 --> 00:16:43,116
I believe that Mr. Domoto will be all right,

259
00:16:43,116 --> 00:16:47,916
regardless of whether you hope otherwise, Akinari.

260
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:52,316
Hope otherwise?

261
00:16:52,316 --> 00:16:54,016
Just what do you mean?

262
00:16:54,016 --> 00:16:55,416
The minute I found out

263
00:16:55,416 --> 00:17:00,216
that this kidnapping was not after ransom, I realized something.

264
00:17:00,216 --> 00:17:04,516
According to what Conan heard from Masayo, the housekeeper,

265
00:17:04,516 --> 00:17:08,216
you and Mitsuko really got along, and got married loving each other.

266
00:17:08,216 --> 00:17:12,216
But after you entered the Domoto family as her wedded husband...

267
00:17:14,716 --> 00:17:17,716
tough days of being criticized by Mr. Domoto for not being ambitious

268
00:17:17,716 --> 00:17:21,416
or not being fit for being an heir continued everyday.

269
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:25,116
You most naturally hated Mr. Domoto

270
00:17:25,116 --> 00:17:27,716
and thought you'd like to erase him from this world.

271
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,616
Don't tell me...

272
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,716
But you didn't have the courage to do so.

273
00:17:33,716 --> 00:17:36,916
Therefore, you thought up this scheme.

274
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,416
Scheme?

275
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,316
Don't be ridiculous. Just what're you talking about?

276
00:17:40,316 --> 00:17:41,516
I know nothing of it.

277
00:17:41,516 --> 00:17:45,216
No! The culprit is Akinari, Inspector Megure.

278
00:17:45,216 --> 00:17:46,216
What?

279
00:17:46,216 --> 00:17:48,316
It can't be.

280
00:17:48,316 --> 00:17:51,716
Mr. Domoto was kidnapped while taking a walk.

281
00:17:51,716 --> 00:17:53,816
At that time Akinari was...

282
00:17:53,816 --> 00:17:56,216
I was doing my work in the study!

283
00:17:56,216 --> 00:17:58,516
I wonder if that's true?

284
00:17:58,516 --> 00:18:00,916
When going into the study, you...

285
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:04,416
Masayo, I'm going to concentrate on work for a while.

286
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,216
So you don't have to bring me tea or anything.

287
00:18:08,616 --> 00:18:12,516
And after saying so to Masayo,

288
00:18:12,516 --> 00:18:14,416
you wore the shoes that you prepared beforehand.

289
00:18:20,716 --> 00:18:23,216
You caught up with Mr. Domoto who was taking a walk

290
00:18:23,216 --> 00:18:24,616
and got him to get in the car.

291
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:28,716
What on earth do you want to talk to me about

292
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:31,116
after bringing me to a place like this?

293
00:18:31,116 --> 00:18:33,316
I tell you, what kind of man are you.

294
00:18:33,316 --> 00:18:35,516
If you have something you want to say, just get to the point.

295
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:38,016
Oh, no.

296
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,916
Akinari, take me home quickly.

297
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,716
I don't have my medicine with me.

298
00:19:00,216 --> 00:19:02,116
Akinari, there's a phone call for you.

299
00:19:07,516 --> 00:19:09,916
What? Kidnap?

300
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:14,316
And you acted out the role of the victim.

301
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,916
Of course there is evidence, too.

302
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,116
The same kind of machine oil

303
00:19:20,116 --> 00:19:21,916
that is smeared over the floor of this factory,

304
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:25,816
should be found on the frame of the window frame of your study,

305
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:28,916
showing that you went out and came back in from the window.

306
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,516
I'm sure that the tissue paper that you used to wipe it off

307
00:19:31,516 --> 00:19:33,816
can also be found somewhere in the room.

308
00:19:33,816 --> 00:19:35,216
And above all,

309
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,816
your footprints when you went in and out of your study.

310
00:19:40,016 --> 00:19:43,816
From the Domoto residence to here, it takes an hour to go and come back.

311
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,616
It was possible for you to commit the crime

312
00:19:45,616 --> 00:19:51,116
between 10:00 to 11:00, the time you were confined to your study.

313
00:19:51,116 --> 00:19:52,716
It is possible,

314
00:19:52,716 --> 00:19:55,116
but he didn't have to do it himself.

315
00:19:55,116 --> 00:19:59,016
He could've made the guy Hirano that he hired do it, couldn't he?

316
00:19:59,016 --> 00:20:00,916
That man was probably not told

317
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:04,916
that he was lending a hand to kidnapping.

318
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,416
He lent a hand without knowing?

319
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,716
Akinari asked Hirano to do just two things.

320
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:13,216
Call me at 11:00 in the morning and 2:00 in the afternoon,

321
00:20:13,216 --> 00:20:16,816
then pick up a trunk at Beika Park.

322
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:20,616
It's for your benefit not to know what's inside the trunk or who I am.

323
00:20:20,616 --> 00:20:24,616
Because if he tells of his scheme, Hirano would hold his weak point.

324
00:20:24,616 --> 00:20:27,916
And aware that his wife was going out,

325
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:30,116
he decided to carry out his scheme today.

326
00:20:30,116 --> 00:20:32,016
What? Kidnapped father?

327
00:20:33,016 --> 00:20:34,816
Ransom...

328
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,016
Beika Park...

329
00:20:36,016 --> 00:20:38,716
In other words, he was acting the conversation out alone.

330
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,916
Yes. Only if Hirano didn't get into an accident,

331
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,016
The money could be retrieved later,

332
00:20:55,016 --> 00:20:58,416
and the scheme would've worked out fine,

333
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:01,916
with neither the police nor the detective showing up.

334
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:07,316
All he had to do was pretend to be worried about Shosaburo and wait.

335
00:21:09,116 --> 00:21:10,616
Exactly.

336
00:21:10,616 --> 00:21:13,716
But the motive is not correct, Mr. Mouri.

337
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:18,316
It's true that I hated him.

338
00:21:18,316 --> 00:21:20,716
I did want him to disappear.

339
00:21:20,716 --> 00:21:22,016
But that's not all.

340
00:21:23,016 --> 00:21:25,616
I wanted to show my wife

341
00:21:25,616 --> 00:21:28,016
how hard I tried to get the money together.

342
00:21:28,016 --> 00:21:29,616
I thought that if she saw that,

343
00:21:29,616 --> 00:21:33,616
her love for me would return once again.

344
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,616
It's me, Mitsuko!

345
00:23:06,616 --> 00:23:10,116
I'm glad. Father's life has been saved.

346
00:23:10,116 --> 00:23:12,416
When he regains consciousness, I'll tell him

347
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:15,616
how desperately you went around to gather money for him,

348
00:23:15,616 --> 00:23:17,616
as well as how worried you were.

349
00:23:17,616 --> 00:23:19,016
I'm sure that father

350
00:23:19,016 --> 00:23:23,016
will stop deliberately taking his anger out on you from now on.

351
00:23:23,016 --> 00:23:24,816
Deliberately?

352
00:23:24,816 --> 00:23:28,616
In order to make you a fine heir,

353
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:31,116
father deliberately took on the hated role and acted it out.

354
00:23:31,116 --> 00:23:34,416
Because father actually likes you.
