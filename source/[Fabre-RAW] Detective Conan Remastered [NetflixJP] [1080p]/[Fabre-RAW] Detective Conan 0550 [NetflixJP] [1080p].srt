1
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:06,329
We all went to eat sushi on Dr. Agasa's treat.

2
00:00:06,329 --> 00:00:09,989
And we landed up in a rotating sushi shop.

3
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:12,629
Although Genta and the others didn't look all that satisfied,

4
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:15,029
they were soon all taken in by the attractiveness of rotating sushi

5
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:17,129
and started eating their favorite dish.

6
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:22,929
But a customer named Mr. Agatsuma sitting next to us

7
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:24,329
started saying next nasty things to us

8
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:25,529
as well as the customers who were there,

9
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:28,007
and ended up picking on the shop manager, too.

10
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,229
Upset over what had happened, just as we were about to leave,

11
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:36,429
Mr. Agatsuma suddenly started to suffer and collapsed.

12
00:00:38,029 --> 00:00:40,629
There was a slight smell of almond from his mouth.

13
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:43,229
This is poisoning.

14
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:45,029
The three people who were on bad terms

15
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:47,429
with Mr. Agatsuma are the suspects.

16
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:51,729
Mr. Aizono, who in the past got into trouble with Mr. Agatsuma.

17
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:54,629
Ms. Sakiko Takemura, whose shop was driven to bankruptcy

18
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:57,629
because of food writer Mr. Agatsuma's article.

19
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:02,329
And Mr. Danji Namiki, a former sushi-maker who hurt his arm

20
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:06,045
after getting involved in a fight caused by Mr. Agatsuma.

21
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:08,829
However, as a result of their body check,

22
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:12,051
none of them had any poison on them.

23
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:14,429
Where on earth did the poison disappear to?

24
00:01:14,429 --> 00:01:18,057
And, how did the killer target only Mr. Agatsuma

25
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:20,829
and make him pick up the poisoned plate?

26
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:26,065
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

"Rotating Sushi Mystery (Part 2)"

34
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,719
But I wonder. Is there a way

35
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:31,719
to make only Mr. Agatsuma pick up the poisoned plate?

36
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,319
That's right, he ordered it!

37
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,919
If he placed the order for the sushi,

38
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,919
he would pick it up for sure!

39
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,319
-Place an order? -Yes.

40
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,319
If you place an order using this touch panel,

41
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,719
the sushi comes in a bowl with the sign "ordered" on it,

42
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,209
and when it comes in front of you, there is beeping sound.

43
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:52,519
I see!

44
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:54,219
So, Ms. Takemura who was seated to the right of the victim

45
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:56,215
could've done it!

46
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:58,019
No way.

47
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:01,119
Even if an ordered plate were to come around,

48
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:03,119
I couldn't have smeared poison on it!

49
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:06,519
Because beyond him, there was a man who was wearing a cap,

50
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:08,919
I had no way of knowing which one of them had placed the order!

51
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:13,619
Besides, I can't even see the touch panel from my seat,

52
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:17,119
so I wasn't able to tell what he ordered.

53
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:19,919
The only one who could see it

54
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,819
was Mr. Aizono who was sitting next to him.

55
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:25,319
Hey, hold it, will you?

56
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,019
I mentioned it a while ago too,

57
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:29,419
but I was sitting to the left of Mr. Agatsuma,

58
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:32,819
and the sushi was rotating from right to left!

59
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:34,253
Even if I were to be able to see

60
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:37,519
what Mr. Agatsuma ordered using the touch panel,

61
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,519
the plate would be picked up by him before it reaches me!

62
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,119
True.

63
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:47,619
Besides, I'm not the only one who can see the touch panel.

64
00:04:47,619 --> 00:04:50,269
The manager can too!

65
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:51,619
Because after arguing with Mr. Agatsuma

66
00:04:51,619 --> 00:04:53,519
and up to the time Mr. Agatsuma collapsed,

67
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,819
he was standing behind him!

68
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:58,019
Is that true?

69
00:04:58,019 --> 00:04:59,419
Yes.

70
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:02,281
Since Mr. Agatsuma was making such a racket,

71
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:05,319
I told him, "You don't have to pay, so please leave."

72
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:08,287
Then he said, "If it's free, I'll eat and leave."

73
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:10,289
So, I stood behind him

74
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:12,291
to watch that he wouldn't make further trouble.

75
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,295
Well, but as far as I saw,

76
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:19,119
he didn't seem to have been ordering anything.

77
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:23,319
We can tell for sure if I check the computer though.

78
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,819
-Check it. -Yes, sir.

79
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:30,309
Officer.

80
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:32,719
Haven't you forgotten?

81
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:35,319
You did a body check on us a while ago,

82
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,719
but no container with poison inside,

83
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:40,319
nor any handkerchief soaked with poison was found!

84
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,323
Despite of this, I question why you keep on suspecting us.

85
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:45,719
I'm sure that the killer

86
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:48,327
was among the customers that already left the shop.

87
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:51,719
Maybe that's why the container with poison inside wasn't found.

88
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:55,319
Which means unless we capture that killer,

89
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:00,119
we'll never find out how just Mr. Agatsuma was targeted.

90
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:03,219
Back off.

91
00:06:03,219 --> 00:06:04,343
Inspector!

92
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:06,345
I checked the computer of the shop,

93
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:08,919
there was no order by Mr. Agatsuma.

94
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:14,719
Left.

95
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:15,919
Left?

96
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,419
I think that the man who died was left handed!

97
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:22,919
Because it was on the fingertip of the man's left hand!

98
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:25,519
The place where 2 or 3 rice grains were stuck on!

99
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,519
Come to think of it, I saw the man eating with his left hand!

100
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,119
Yes, yes, he picked up the sushi with his left hand!

101
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:33,719
I saw him, too!

102
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:37,519
I see. If he was left handed...

103
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,319
If most of the poison is smeared on to the left side facing the plate,

104
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:44,819
it seems possible to make only him touch the poison.

105
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,819
Yes.

106
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:51,519
Okay. Check all the plates on the conveyer belt

107
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:54,419
to see if there are any other plates with poison on them!

108
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:55,419
Yes, sir!

109
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:57,219
We're counting on you, forensics!

110
00:06:57,219 --> 00:06:58,719
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

111
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:06,919
But I wonder if we're really right about it?

112
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:08,119
If it were really true,

113
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:09,919
the killer would've had to smear the poison on after verifying that

114
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,413
Mr. Agatsuma is the only left-handed customer in this lane.

115
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:18,219
But if after that, a left-handed customer suddenly comes in, then what?

116
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:23,019
Besides, if it were to be a child instead of a left-handed customer.

117
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:24,419
Moreover, it's likely that the plate

118
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,425
would be picked up with both hands, too.

119
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:30,019
Where on earth did the poison disappear to in the first place?

120
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,819
This crime isn't possible unless a container with poison

121
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:37,119
or a cloth-like thing soaked with poison is found.

122
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:40,719
There's something by the tea cup of the seat

123
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:42,919
where Mr. Agatsuma was seated.

124
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:45,519
A piece of a vinyl wrapper.

125
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:48,447
Huh? If I'm not mistaken, this is...

126
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:54,019
Huh?

127
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:56,219
-Nothing was found? -Yeah.

128
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:59,019
Although there were many plates going around at the same time

129
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:02,819
that Mr. Agatsuma picked up the poisoned plate...

130
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:05,719
Weren't there any other plates with poison on them?

131
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,419
Not even one.

132
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:10,019
If so, the victim would've had to pick up

133
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:12,471
the only poisoned plate there was

134
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:16,475
as if he were under hypnosis or something.

135
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:20,479
Maybe there was a message or something on the plate?

136
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,719
Like, this is a present for you or something.

137
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:26,919
I would never pick up such a plate

138
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:28,487
because it's kind of creepy.

139
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:30,489
Well, a card's not thinkable.

140
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,119
Oh?

141
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:33,619
Because if it were so,

142
00:08:33,619 --> 00:08:36,495
the man would've had a card on him.

143
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:38,497
I could care less, though.

144
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,501
I'm hungry!

145
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:45,519
You just ate a while ago!

146
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,319
That sushi...

147
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:49,519
Can't I eat it?

148
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,511
Of course not!

149
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:55,719
But you're going to throw it away anyway, right?

150
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:57,219
Don't you think it's a waste?

151
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:02,019
Yeah! That's it!

152
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:05,519
Ai, will you lend me your handkerchief?

153
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,419
I want to wipe my glasses.

154
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:11,119
Then, use the disposal hand wipes of this shop!

155
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:13,819
There were some by the entrance.

156
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,535
Wait a sec. That's...

157
00:09:20,219 --> 00:09:21,819
I see.

158
00:09:21,819 --> 00:09:25,119
It had to be sushi to carry this trick out!

159
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:28,119
Which means that the killer is that person.

160
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:30,219
The killer poisoned only Mr. Agatsuma

161
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:33,619
and set up a trick to get rid of the evidence

162
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:37,719
using this special system of rotating sushi.

163
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:40,019
A very clever trick!

164
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:45,119
Officer.

165
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:47,819
Are you still suspecting us?

166
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:53,419
I can understand you wanting to suspect us,

167
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:55,619
who had reasons for hating him.

168
00:09:55,619 --> 00:09:57,519
But if the only plate that had poison on it

169
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,579
was the one that Mr. Agatsuma picked up,

170
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:03,919
I think it would've been impossible to target just him.

171
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:06,119
But it's true that you all

172
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:09,119
had a chance to smear poison on the plate, too.

173
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:11,919
Explain it to us, then!

174
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,319
How would you make that man

175
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:17,319
pick up the only poisoned plate there is?

176
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:21,619
Or? Are you saying that we look like some super ruthless killer

177
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:25,619
that would randomly kill anybody?

178
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:28,319
No, that's not it.

179
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:30,019
And even if we wanted to smear the plate with poison,

180
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:34,019
we didn't have any container with poison in it on us.

181
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,219
If we are the killer, we should have it on us, right?

182
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,617
From the time that man collapsed

183
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:41,519
to the time the police came and body checked us,

184
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,623
we didn't move from here at all!

185
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:46,625
Like I said a while ago,

186
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:51,019
I think the killer is one of the customers who already left the shop.

187
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:57,419
If so, it's understandable why no container with poison was found.

188
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:01,219
It seems that someone who just randomly wanted to kill,

189
00:11:01,219 --> 00:11:03,419
left the poisoned plate behind

190
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:06,919
and Mr. Agatsuma unluckily happened to pick it up.

191
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:10,649
-That's... -He seems to have indeed been unlucky.

192
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:14,319
Using my voice without permission again.

193
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:18,657
But that's not about Mr. Agatsuma who was killed.

194
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:20,659
I'm talking about the killer that's in front of me

195
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:23,219
snickering that everything seems to have turned out well!

196
00:11:23,219 --> 00:11:26,665
And I will show you how the killer put poison on Mr. Agatsuma's plate

197
00:11:26,665 --> 00:11:32,671
as well as how the container with the poison disappeared.

198
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:35,119
I will disclose all this by a simple deduction

199
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:37,419
made by me, who just happened to be here.

200
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:41,019
So, the killer is among the people here after all?

201
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:44,683
Yes! Just as you, the police pointed out,

202
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:46,685
the killer is among the three here

203
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:49,319
who have a grudge against Mr. Agatsuma!

204
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,386
Hey, what's with you, anyway?

205
00:12:03,386 --> 00:12:05,186
Suddenly butting in and blabbering!

206
00:12:05,186 --> 00:12:07,686
Just because you're a bit stout,

207
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,986
acting like a big shot, like some detective or something!

208
00:12:09,986 --> 00:12:11,886
Oh, well...

209
00:12:11,886 --> 00:12:14,286
Size doesn't matter, anyway.

210
00:12:14,286 --> 00:12:16,086
Did you see us do it or what?

211
00:12:16,086 --> 00:12:19,486
Us smearing poison on that man's plate!

212
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:21,386
No, I didn't.

213
00:12:21,386 --> 00:12:22,721
Then...

214
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:25,086
Well, of course I didn't

215
00:12:25,086 --> 00:12:26,986
because the one who smeared poison on his plate

216
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:29,186
was Mr. Agatsuma himself.

217
00:12:29,186 --> 00:12:30,729
What?

218
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:33,486
Doc, talk with confidence like a detective would.

219
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,486
But, Mr. Agasa.

220
00:12:35,486 --> 00:12:37,086
If the one who smeared poison on the plate

221
00:12:37,086 --> 00:12:39,286
was the one who was killed by the poison,

222
00:12:39,286 --> 00:12:41,086
wouldn't that be suicide?

223
00:12:41,086 --> 00:12:45,086
No. What I'm saying is the poison was not on the plate

224
00:12:45,086 --> 00:12:49,186
but on something else that he touched before touching the plate!

225
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:53,386
That's why the poison was only on Mr. Agatsuma's plate!

226
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:56,755
But, just what is that something else?

227
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:57,986
What is it?

228
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,186
Hey, you guys!

229
00:13:00,186 --> 00:13:04,186
Before the plate with what you want to eat comes around in front of you,

230
00:13:04,186 --> 00:13:07,286
what do you touch before you pick up the plate?

231
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,767
Well...

232
00:13:08,986 --> 00:13:10,769
First, I guess I'd take a pair of chopsticks.

233
00:13:10,986 --> 00:13:13,086
Drink tea from the tea cup.

234
00:13:13,086 --> 00:13:15,586
And pour soy sauce into my dish.

235
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,777
No, not what you touch before picking up the first plate,

236
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:21,886
but what you touch after eating several plates!

237
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:23,886
I'm pretty sure you touched it, Genta.

238
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,286
Huh? Me?

239
00:13:25,286 --> 00:13:26,785
Conan.

240
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:30,086
We checked everything by Mr. Agatsuma's seat,

241
00:13:30,086 --> 00:13:32,791
but there was no poison smeared anywhere.

242
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,586
So, even if Mr. Agatsuma were to have touched

243
00:13:35,586 --> 00:13:36,795
before picked up his plate...

244
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:40,386
Then, what is there at Mitsuhiko's seat but not at Genta's?

245
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,186
He's not listening to me.

246
00:13:42,186 --> 00:13:43,886
Uh...

247
00:13:43,886 --> 00:13:45,186
Oh, chopsticks!

248
00:13:45,186 --> 00:13:47,886
There are no chopsticks at Genta's seat!

249
00:13:47,886 --> 00:13:51,286
Genta was eating picking up the sushi with his hands, that's why.

250
00:13:51,286 --> 00:13:53,086
Dad used to tell me

251
00:13:53,086 --> 00:13:54,586
people who's originally from the downtown district of Tokyo

252
00:13:54,586 --> 00:13:56,486
should eat sushi with their hands!

253
00:13:56,486 --> 00:13:59,086
If you were eating using your hands,

254
00:13:59,086 --> 00:14:00,819
isn't there something that you'd want to touch?

255
00:14:00,986 --> 00:14:03,086
Something I want to touch?

256
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:04,823
I licked my fingers.

257
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:07,186
Then, what did you do after licking your fingers?

258
00:14:07,186 --> 00:14:09,986
After that, I...

259
00:14:09,986 --> 00:14:12,831
I see. Hand wipes!

260
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:16,286
Because after touching the sushi and fish directly with the hands,

261
00:14:16,286 --> 00:14:21,586
you would want to wipe of the oil of the fish, the water

262
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:24,843
and sticky vinegar rice from the hands.

263
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:28,386
Are you saying that the poison was on the hand wipe?

264
00:14:28,386 --> 00:14:30,486
Right, Doc?

265
00:14:30,486 --> 00:14:31,586
Yeah.

266
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:35,486
But there were no hand wipes at Mr. Agatsuma's seat.

267
00:14:35,486 --> 00:14:38,857
But there are traces that there was, wasn't there?

268
00:14:41,886 --> 00:14:42,861
This!

269
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:47,386
Right. Anybody can freely take it at the entrance of the shop.

270
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:51,786
It's the torn off piece of vinyl that the disposable was in!

271
00:14:51,786 --> 00:14:53,186
This is it.

272
00:14:53,186 --> 00:14:55,386
It's likely that the killer put poison

273
00:14:55,386 --> 00:15:00,286
inside the vinyl package of the hand wipe

274
00:15:00,286 --> 00:15:02,386
using a syringe or something.

275
00:15:02,386 --> 00:15:03,986
I get it!

276
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,386
After he touched the poisoned hand wipe, he took the plate,

277
00:15:07,386 --> 00:15:11,386
he picked up the sushi with his fingers, ate it and died.

278
00:15:11,386 --> 00:15:14,893
That's why poison was found only on that plate!

279
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:17,186
Yeah, exactly!

280
00:15:17,186 --> 00:15:22,901
But Mr. Agatsuma's been quite a lot before he was poisoned to death!

281
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:24,186
It's difficult to understand

282
00:15:24,186 --> 00:15:27,386
why he didn't touch the poisoned hand wipe at all until then.

283
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:30,186
No, it was switched part way.

284
00:15:30,186 --> 00:15:33,986
Most probably when the store manager was arguing with Mr. Agatsuma!

285
00:15:33,986 --> 00:15:37,886
But, if somebody else were to stretch their hand over

286
00:15:37,886 --> 00:15:39,186
and touch the hand wipe,

287
00:15:39,186 --> 00:15:41,986
I'm sure that he would've noticed,

288
00:15:41,986 --> 00:15:44,386
and say, "Just what do you think you're doing?"

289
00:15:44,386 --> 00:15:46,386
What if the killer knew that

290
00:15:46,386 --> 00:15:50,686
Mr. Agatsuma would put the hand wipe near him?

291
00:15:50,686 --> 00:15:52,931
But where a person places the hand wipe depends on each and every person,

292
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:54,286
in other words, it could be anywhere.

293
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,935
No, Mr. Agatsuma is left-handed.

294
00:15:56,935 --> 00:16:00,686
If he'd been using the hand wipe each time he ate sushi,

295
00:16:00,686 --> 00:16:03,886
it's only natural that he would put it on his left side, right?

296
00:16:03,886 --> 00:16:08,086
Yes, it's the seat to the left of Mr. Agatsuma where you were seated...

297
00:16:08,086 --> 00:16:09,786
Mr. Aizono!

298
00:16:09,786 --> 00:16:12,386
He would put the hand wipe where you were seated!

299
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:16,955
If you put the hand wipe that you pretended

300
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:20,959
to be using right next to Mr. Agatsuma's,

301
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,886
it would be a cinch to switch it!

302
00:16:23,886 --> 00:16:26,286
Just what do you think you're saying?

303
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:28,967
If so, where did it disappear to?

304
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:31,386
The hand wipe with the poison on it!

305
00:16:31,386 --> 00:16:34,286
Did I have something like that on me, officer?

306
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:37,486
No. Although I did do a body check,

307
00:16:37,486 --> 00:16:38,977
no such thing was found.

308
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:40,486
See!

309
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:42,986
If you're going to insist that I'm the killer,

310
00:16:42,986 --> 00:16:46,586
first prove how the poisoned hand wipe disappeared.

311
00:16:46,586 --> 00:16:50,686
It didn't disappear! It was naturally gotten rid of

312
00:16:50,686 --> 00:16:54,086
by this rotating sushi system that gets rid of everything

313
00:16:54,086 --> 00:16:56,995
when the time comes!

314
00:16:56,995 --> 00:16:59,286
I get it! When the time comes at this rotating sushi shop,

315
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:00,686
the sushi that has been going around for some time

316
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,001
is automatically disposed of!

317
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:05,003
This system was taken advantage of!

318
00:17:05,186 --> 00:17:08,186
Right! He probably did what he did

319
00:17:08,186 --> 00:17:13,986
when Mr. Agatsuma collapsed and everybody's attention was on him.

320
00:17:13,986 --> 00:17:17,015
If the killer put the hand wipe that Mr. Agatsuma was originally using

321
00:17:17,186 --> 00:17:20,286
inside the vinyl bag that had the poisoned hand wipe inside it,

322
00:17:20,286 --> 00:17:21,786
wrapped it up and put it on the plate,

323
00:17:21,786 --> 00:17:24,586
it would be difficult to make out from a distance

324
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:27,025
whether it is sushi on the plate or the hand wipe because both are white.

325
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:30,586
It's true that if you put the plate back on the belt conveyer,

326
00:17:30,586 --> 00:17:33,031
it would automatically be disposed of,

327
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:35,033
but if you do something that is ill mannered

328
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:37,035
such as to return the plate that you once took,

329
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:39,586
someone is bound to have noticed and remembered.

330
00:17:39,586 --> 00:17:43,386
Remember, no joke! Everybody was doing so!

331
00:17:43,386 --> 00:17:44,486
Everybody?

332
00:17:44,486 --> 00:17:46,386
Saying things like, "food poisoning"!

333
00:17:46,386 --> 00:17:48,186
"Don't eat it."

334
00:17:48,186 --> 00:17:50,486
"Put the plate back!"

335
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,786
Everybody was putting the plates back,

336
00:17:51,786 --> 00:17:53,486
so no one said anything about it!

337
00:17:53,486 --> 00:17:56,286
But the conveyer belt of this lane

338
00:17:56,286 --> 00:18:00,086
-was stopped immediately, wasn't it? -Yes.

339
00:18:00,086 --> 00:18:03,061
2 or 3 minutes after Mr. Agatsuma collapsed.

340
00:18:03,286 --> 00:18:06,586
It's unnatural that the sushi would so conveniently be disposed of

341
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,386
in such a short time, right?

342
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:11,069
It's true that if the plate were just picked up some time

343
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:14,086
would've had to pass before the plate would be disposed of,

344
00:18:14,086 --> 00:18:16,286
but if the plate were switched with the first plate

345
00:18:16,286 --> 00:18:18,286
that was taken after coming to the shop...

346
00:18:20,486 --> 00:18:23,086
The device that read this mark

347
00:18:23,086 --> 00:18:27,085
would mistakenly determine that the plate has been around for some time

348
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:29,486
and dispose of it right away, wouldn't it?

349
00:18:32,886 --> 00:18:35,093
Where do the disposed sushi go?

350
00:18:35,286 --> 00:18:37,486
Yes, sir. It goes to the garbage disposal.

351
00:18:37,486 --> 00:18:40,486
Okay, check that garbage disposal!

352
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:43,586
The poisoned hand wipe and vinyl should be there!

353
00:18:43,586 --> 00:18:45,103
Yes, sir!

354
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:50,286
Mr. Aizono. If your prints are found on that vinyl bag,

355
00:18:50,286 --> 00:18:52,886
it would serve as conclusive evidence.

356
00:18:55,386 --> 00:18:58,186
If you turn out to be the killer,

357
00:18:58,186 --> 00:18:59,686
your motive is probably

358
00:18:59,686 --> 00:19:04,386
the argument you had with Mr. Agatsuma before at this shop?

359
00:19:04,386 --> 00:19:07,125
Yes.

360
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,086
If I remember correctly, he pointed out

361
00:19:10,086 --> 00:19:13,686
you mistaking sea bass for flatfish in front of your wife.

362
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:17,135
Yes. Well, I happened to have a cold that day,

363
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:18,586
and couldn't really taste the fish.

364
00:19:18,586 --> 00:19:22,186
It's only naturally that I made a mistake too

365
00:19:22,186 --> 00:19:25,143
because just before that sea bass came to my seat,

366
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:28,486
it was switched and placed on a plate that had expensive flatfish on it.

367
00:19:28,486 --> 00:19:31,149
Huh? It was switched?

368
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:33,586
That Agatsuma...

369
00:19:33,586 --> 00:19:36,686
He got nasty with me who was explaining to my wife

370
00:19:36,686 --> 00:19:38,886
and deliberately took the plate with the sea bass

371
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,886
and flatfish on it and switched them.

372
00:19:43,986 --> 00:19:45,163
Even after that incident,

373
00:19:45,386 --> 00:19:50,686
he wrote in nasty comments on my "gourmet walk" blog.

374
00:19:50,686 --> 00:19:53,171
My wife used to tell me not to let him bother me,

375
00:19:53,386 --> 00:19:55,173
but I couldn't forgive him!

376
00:19:55,386 --> 00:19:57,175
I couldn't bear the fact that a rotten guy like him

377
00:19:57,386 --> 00:20:00,086
was making a living as a food writer writing about food!

378
00:20:00,086 --> 00:20:02,986
That's why you poisoned him to death?

379
00:20:02,986 --> 00:20:08,286
Yes. Since then, I could never enjoy anything I ate.

380
00:20:08,286 --> 00:20:11,786
I eventually divorced my wife, too.

381
00:20:11,786 --> 00:20:15,486
All I liked to do was eat.

382
00:20:15,486 --> 00:20:19,186
I was just happy watching my wife

383
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:22,586
enjoy eating at the shop that I recommended.

384
00:20:22,586 --> 00:20:25,486
But that guy spoiled it all!

385
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:33,211
But, sir, do you know?

386
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:38,386
That you yourself, tarnished what you liked to do best.

387
00:20:40,386 --> 00:20:42,786
With a deadly poison called murder

388
00:20:42,786 --> 00:20:45,586
that cannot be wiped off no matter how hard you try.

389
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:53,886
After this, the vinyl bag in question

390
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:56,886
was found from the garbage disposal,

391
00:20:56,886 --> 00:20:59,237
and the case was solved.

392
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:02,986
The sushi that stopped rotating would probably start rotating again.

393
00:21:02,986 --> 00:21:05,786
But no more for a while.

394
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:09,786
I can't stand rotating sushi that reminds me of this sick incident.

395
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:33,331
Well, I really felt that

396
00:22:33,331 --> 00:22:36,086
I wouldn't care for rotating sushi for a while, but...

397
00:22:36,086 --> 00:22:37,986
It's delicious!

398
00:22:37,986 --> 00:22:40,886
-This place is pretty good too, isn't it? -Yes!

399
00:22:40,886 --> 00:22:42,486
We're addicted already!

400
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,386
Two eel plates for me!

401
00:22:44,386 --> 00:22:45,886
Sushi is a cultural cuisine that Japan created

402
00:22:45,886 --> 00:22:47,986
that can be boasted of worldwide!

403
00:22:47,986 --> 00:22:51,349
Being Japanese, I can't help but wanting to eat it.

404
00:22:53,586 --> 00:22:56,686
It seems that a rotating sushi shop is also going to open soon

405
00:22:56,686 --> 00:22:57,886
in front of the station.

406
00:22:57,886 --> 00:22:59,886
What? Really?

407
00:22:59,886 --> 00:23:03,086
Let's have Doc take us there again too, then!

408
00:23:03,086 --> 00:23:05,363
All right, sounds good!

409
00:23:05,363 --> 00:23:06,586
Let's go! Let's go!

410
00:23:12,086 --> 00:23:14,286
It'll be 12,500 yen.

411
00:23:14,286 --> 00:23:15,373
Huh?

412
00:23:15,373 --> 00:23:18,586
You sure it's not a mistake?

413
00:23:18,586 --> 00:23:21,686
That fruit parfait was good!

414
00:23:21,686 --> 00:23:23,786
My pudding a-la-mode was good, too.

415
00:23:23,786 --> 00:23:27,385
I ate all the dessert there were, but they were all good!

416
00:23:27,586 --> 00:23:29,886
You parfaits and pudding too?

417
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:33,786
Yes, although they're a bit more expensive than the sushi.

418
00:23:33,786 --> 00:23:37,086
Oh, right! I thought of something good!

419
00:23:37,086 --> 00:23:41,399
Why don't we make Saturday sushi day?

420
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:44,486
-Sounds good! -I agree!

421
00:23:45,886 --> 00:23:48,386
Okay, the Youth Detective Squad

422
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:50,886
will go around on Saturdays to sushi shops!

423
00:23:50,886 --> 00:23:52,486
-Yeah! -Yeah!

424
00:23:52,486 --> 00:23:54,686
Hey...

425
00:23:54,686 --> 00:23:57,415
My head's spinning round!

426
00:23:57,415 --> 00:23:59,686
It's because you got stingy to start with.

427
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:03,748
Next Conan's Hint:

428
00:24:03,748 --> 00:24:05,423
"Mr. Kojima"

429
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,116
Genta's father makes an appearance in the next episode!

430
00:24:08,116 --> 00:24:10,540
-Dad's not the culprit... -Let's find out next week about that.
