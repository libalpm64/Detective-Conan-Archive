1
00:00:02,792 --> 00:00:04,494
Just as flowing water has no form

2
00:00:04,494 --> 00:00:06,196
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:06,196 --> 00:00:08,198
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:08,198 --> 00:00:09,899
Happy New Year, everyone!

5
00:00:09,899 --> 00:00:12,302
And to kick off the new millennium, a two-hour special!

6
00:00:12,302 --> 00:00:13,803
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,803 --> 00:00:15,705
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,705 --> 00:00:18,608
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:52,102 --> 00:01:53,803
It's the bottom of the ninth, the score's 3-2

10
00:01:53,803 --> 00:01:55,305
with Chunichi leading by a point.

11
00:01:55,305 --> 00:01:56,906
Ace relief pitcher, Komatsu,

12
00:01:56,906 --> 00:01:59,909
is on the mound with two outs and runner, on second base...

13
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,123
Hey! Did you kill him?

14
00:02:13,123 --> 00:02:14,324
Yes!

15
00:02:14,324 --> 00:02:16,326
I shot him four times.

16
00:02:16,326 --> 00:02:19,329
I'm sure he's dead.

17
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,932
So Saizo Kano, the Mastermind in the shadows,

18
00:02:22,932 --> 00:02:24,334
is now drifting like seaweed in the sea.

19
00:02:24,334 --> 00:02:28,938
Probably, the current in this area is strong.

20
00:02:28,938 --> 00:02:32,342
Before the body floats up, it'll be food for the fishes.

21
00:02:32,342 --> 00:02:34,044
But...

22
00:02:34,044 --> 00:02:37,247
but why'd we have to kill him?

23
00:02:37,247 --> 00:02:39,949
You fool! Do you think we could let that coward go?

24
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:43,653
He said we should turn ourselves in because we killed one lousy bank clerk.

25
00:02:43,653 --> 00:02:46,856
Besides, the police had him identified.

26
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:48,058
Never mind him, now what're we going to do?

27
00:02:48,058 --> 00:02:49,859
That money is hot.

28
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:51,361
Yes, he is right.

29
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:52,462
Out of the 400 million yen,

30
00:02:52,462 --> 00:02:55,065
the cops have the serial numbers for 300 million, right?

31
00:02:55,065 --> 00:02:56,866
Don't worry.

32
00:02:56,866 --> 00:03:00,570
We already pulled off the big job.

33
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:04,374
All we have to do now is wait until the right time.

34
00:03:06,276 --> 00:03:08,278
Here!

35
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:13,283
This is our farewell gift to you.

36
00:03:14,584 --> 00:03:16,886
No grudges, okay?

37
00:03:18,488 --> 00:03:20,090
Boss.

38
00:03:24,994 --> 00:03:30,700
"Murder on The S.S. Symphony, 20 Years Vendetta"

39
00:03:31,701 --> 00:03:34,104
Record...

40
00:03:34,104 --> 00:03:38,008
-What? -The answer has got to be a record!

41
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:40,210
What are you talking about anyway?

42
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,512
This, here!

43
00:03:42,512 --> 00:03:43,613
See!

44
00:03:45,315 --> 00:03:47,617
Read this.

45
00:03:47,617 --> 00:03:50,120
"Special Announcement" -Special announcement.

46
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,421
What?

47
00:03:51,421 --> 00:03:57,427
Something important most people in Japan had during the Showa era.

48
00:03:57,427 --> 00:03:59,629
Do you still have it?

49
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:03,833
Bring this valuable but increasingly obsolete item

50
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,835
-to join... -The next part...

51
00:04:05,835 --> 00:04:07,137
Read the next part!

52
00:04:07,137 --> 00:04:09,139
Don't bother me.

53
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:11,141
The first ten people who bring the correct item

54
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:14,544
will win an all-expense paid trip to the Ogasawara Dolphin Tour.

55
00:04:14,544 --> 00:04:17,447
Let's give a try, come on.

56
00:04:17,447 --> 00:04:19,749
There's still time, let's take a record down there!

57
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:23,153
Come on! Conan, you want to see the dolphins too, don't you?

58
00:04:23,153 --> 00:04:26,956
Don't you, Conan?

59
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:29,259
Come on, you don't mind, do you?

60
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:31,761
We don't have anything to do this long weekend anyway.

61
00:04:31,761 --> 00:04:35,965
Gosh. Forget it, the tour sounds boring.

62
00:04:35,965 --> 00:04:39,969
Besides, your answer's wrong!

63
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:44,174
If it was records, they wouldn't have written "people in Japan".

64
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:46,076
All right. What's the right answer?

65
00:04:46,076 --> 00:04:48,878
You stupid! That's what modern Japanese people have lost!

66
00:04:48,878 --> 00:04:51,081
"Samurai spirit", no doubt about it!

67
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:54,084
How are you going to take bring something like that down there?

68
00:04:54,084 --> 00:04:58,988
Besides, I've never had samurai spirit, and I doubt I ever will!

69
00:04:58,988 --> 00:05:02,192
All right. Maybe it's a yoyo or bell bottom pants.

70
00:05:02,192 --> 00:05:05,495
-How about that mushroom tea? -Designer brands or family computers?

71
00:05:05,495 --> 00:05:06,796
Yes, I know what it is.

72
00:05:06,796 --> 00:05:09,899
How about that frilled lizard?

73
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:11,901
It was pretty popular back then!

74
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:12,902
What is it anyway?

75
00:05:12,902 --> 00:05:14,804
Excuse me.

76
00:05:14,804 --> 00:05:18,108
I think the answer is...

77
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,413
You're right!

78
00:05:23,413 --> 00:05:25,115
Right this way to the cruiser.

79
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:26,516
All right!

80
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:29,819
We did it! You were right, Conan.

81
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:32,122
I was just lucky!

82
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:33,723
Next contestant, step this way!

83
00:05:33,723 --> 00:05:37,727
We sure were lucky we still one of the old bills!

84
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:41,131
Put that away right now, the others in the back will see it.

85
00:05:41,131 --> 00:05:43,233
You're so stingy, Pops.

86
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:47,237
Don't worry. It's not something they pull out of their pockets so readily.

87
00:05:47,237 --> 00:05:50,840
No way! It's not this? Unbelievable!

88
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,842
It's not the answer.

89
00:05:52,842 --> 00:05:54,244
He was right.

90
00:05:55,245 --> 00:05:57,547
Next contestant.

91
00:05:57,547 --> 00:05:59,249
Wait!

92
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:02,652
This is real fancy!

93
00:06:02,652 --> 00:06:05,155
I'm so excited!

94
00:06:05,155 --> 00:06:09,859
Congratulations! This is a pamphlet for today's tour.

95
00:06:09,859 --> 00:06:11,361
Thank you.

96
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:14,664
What number are we?

97
00:06:14,664 --> 00:06:17,967
There's three in your party, but not counting the boy,

98
00:06:17,967 --> 00:06:20,270
there's one more opening on the tour.

99
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,272
We just made it!

100
00:06:22,272 --> 00:06:23,573
How lucky!

101
00:06:23,573 --> 00:06:26,976
That's right. The maximum number for the tour was ten.

102
00:06:26,976 --> 00:06:29,579
But this sure is a huge ship for such a small group.

103
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:31,781
Conan, we're going!

104
00:06:31,781 --> 00:06:33,283
Okay, coming!

105
00:06:35,785 --> 00:06:37,287
It's like a hotel!

106
00:06:37,287 --> 00:06:41,591
Going to Ogasawara on this won't be bad!

107
00:06:41,591 --> 00:06:42,592
Congratulations!

108
00:06:42,592 --> 00:06:44,394
Thank you.

109
00:06:44,394 --> 00:06:47,897
Party of three, are you one family?

110
00:06:47,897 --> 00:06:48,998
Yes, sort of.

111
00:06:48,998 --> 00:06:51,901
So I'll put you in a twin room. The room number is 101.

112
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:54,004
May I ask you a question?

113
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:57,307
Mr. Masaru Furukawa, the man who planned this tour,

114
00:06:57,307 --> 00:06:58,608
is he on board this ship?

115
00:06:58,608 --> 00:06:59,609
Excuse me?

116
00:06:59,609 --> 00:07:01,911
I wanted to thank him for giving me the opportunity

117
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:04,114
to sail on this fantastic ship!

118
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:07,617
The thing is, none of us crew members have met him either.

119
00:07:07,617 --> 00:07:08,918
You haven't met him?

120
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:11,521
No! The reservation for the cruise

121
00:07:11,521 --> 00:07:14,424
as well as the method for selecting the passengers,

122
00:07:14,424 --> 00:07:16,826
everything was done by phone.

123
00:07:16,826 --> 00:07:20,530
The charter fee was also directly transferred through the bank.

124
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:24,334
I'm sure he'll be waiting for the ship at Ogasawara, though.

125
00:07:24,334 --> 00:07:27,937
-I see. -By the way, sir,

126
00:07:27,937 --> 00:07:30,340
may I please have your name?

127
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,342
Of course.

128
00:07:32,342 --> 00:07:36,046
Actually, my name is Kogoro Mouri!

129
00:07:36,046 --> 00:07:38,648
A former detective with the Metropolitan Police Department,

130
00:07:38,648 --> 00:07:43,053
now an awe-inspiring well known private detective!

131
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:44,454
Isn't that right?

132
00:07:44,454 --> 00:07:47,957
Oh... Police Superintendent Samezaki!

133
00:07:47,957 --> 00:07:51,261
Hey, I'm not a Police Superintendent anymore!

134
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:53,663
"Toji Samezaki (62)" -I retired two years ago,

135
00:07:53,663 --> 00:07:57,267
"Former Superintendent, Homicide Department" -I'm just an old fogey now.

136
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:58,968
It's been ages!

137
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:03,173
Is that you, Ran? You sure have grown up to be quite a beauty!

138
00:08:03,173 --> 00:08:05,375
But what brings you here?

139
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:09,279
I just got a hankering to see the ocean.

140
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,982
Remember? Today's a special day!

141
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:16,186
A special day?

142
00:08:16,186 --> 00:08:18,288
I don't blame you for forgetting,

143
00:08:18,288 --> 00:08:22,692
after all you left the force 10 years ago.

144
00:08:22,692 --> 00:08:26,496
By the way, how's that gorgeous wife of yours?

145
00:08:26,496 --> 00:08:29,399
Don't tell me you two are still separated.

146
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,701
As a matter of fact, we are.

147
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:33,903
Never mind that, don't mention that woman.

148
00:08:33,903 --> 00:08:35,405
Dad!

149
00:08:35,405 --> 00:08:37,907
Well, excuse me.

150
00:08:37,907 --> 00:08:39,009
What is it?

151
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:42,912
"Teruyoshi Kameda (45), Passenger" -Nothing, never mind.

152
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:50,420
A seal?

153
00:08:52,222 --> 00:08:54,524
You dropped this.

154
00:08:54,524 --> 00:08:56,726
Excuse me?

155
00:08:56,726 --> 00:08:58,428
Thank you very much!

156
00:08:58,428 --> 00:09:03,433
What? Thank you.

157
00:09:03,433 --> 00:09:06,436
You picked up his seal, so why'd you thank him?

158
00:09:06,436 --> 00:09:08,838
Never mind...

159
00:09:08,838 --> 00:09:11,141
Hey!

160
00:09:11,141 --> 00:09:12,742
What is it?

161
00:09:12,742 --> 00:09:14,444
Are you talking to me?

162
00:09:15,645 --> 00:09:18,648
"Korehisa Kanie (46), Passenger" -I've been waiting for you.

163
00:09:19,849 --> 00:09:21,251
How about it?

164
00:09:21,251 --> 00:09:22,852
Let's go have a drink over there.

165
00:09:22,852 --> 00:09:25,355
Sir! Allow me to carry those!

166
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:27,457
No, thanks!

167
00:09:29,859 --> 00:09:32,362
Party of one, sir?

168
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:33,363
Yes.

169
00:09:33,363 --> 00:09:36,366
Excluding that boy, this man's number 10,

170
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:37,367
he's the last one.

171
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:40,170
All right, we can set out then, can't we?

172
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,372
We're already behind schedule.

173
00:09:42,372 --> 00:09:46,376
Not yet! There's that old man who came at the beginning.

174
00:09:46,376 --> 00:09:48,178
He left to go get something he forgot,

175
00:09:48,178 --> 00:09:49,779
but hasn't come back yet.

176
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:52,982
What? That old man...

177
00:09:52,982 --> 00:09:56,786
he was just here and said he wanted to take a short nap before dinner

178
00:09:56,786 --> 00:09:59,789
so he didn't want to be disturbed.

179
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:02,292
What? When'd he gets back anyway?

180
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:05,395
Well, at any rate, we have the ten passengers.

181
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:07,897
I'm sorry, please send the rest of the contestants home.

182
00:10:07,897 --> 00:10:09,899
All right! I'll go!

183
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:13,103
Now then, sir, you'll be in room 107.

184
00:10:13,103 --> 00:10:14,504
Thanks!

185
00:10:16,106 --> 00:10:17,507
Wait a minute!

186
00:10:17,507 --> 00:10:21,111
Excuse me, but haven't we met somewhere before?

187
00:10:21,111 --> 00:10:22,112
No.

188
00:10:22,112 --> 00:10:24,414
"Minoru Ebina (42), Passenger" -You must be mistaken.

189
00:10:24,414 --> 00:10:27,817
I've never seen you before today.

190
00:10:31,821 --> 00:10:36,126
Did you find someone on the police wanted list, Superintendent Samezaki?

191
00:10:36,126 --> 00:10:40,430
Thanks to you people, I'm certain we'll have a safe journey, Mr. Mouri.

192
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,032
What?

193
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:43,833
After all, he is a former police officer

194
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:44,834
and you are a private investigator.

195
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:47,837
There're three of you on board!

196
00:10:47,837 --> 00:10:49,639
Three of us?

197
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:52,342
There's someone else besides us?

198
00:10:52,342 --> 00:10:55,245
Yes! Another private investigator,

199
00:10:55,245 --> 00:10:58,248
although he doesn't look it.

200
00:10:58,248 --> 00:11:02,652
Thank you all for joining us today on the S.S. Symphony,

201
00:11:02,652 --> 00:11:04,654
we will now leave the dock.

202
00:11:04,654 --> 00:11:08,158
We are scheduled to arrive in Ogasawara tomorrow morning,

203
00:11:08,158 --> 00:11:10,560
relax and have a pleasant journey!

204
00:11:38,188 --> 00:11:43,793
I'm the king of the world!

205
00:11:44,894 --> 00:11:47,297
She said she wanted to that once in her lifetime.

206
00:11:47,297 --> 00:11:49,299
She's been watching too many movies.

207
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:52,102
What is she going to do if we really sink? What a bad omen!

208
00:11:54,304 --> 00:11:55,905
Well...

209
00:11:55,905 --> 00:11:58,808
"Sadao Kujirai (50), Passenger" -The mighty ocean glowing in the sunset.

210
00:11:58,808 --> 00:12:00,610
With the fantastic view right in front of us,

211
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,613
I don't blame her for wanting to shout like that.

212
00:12:05,615 --> 00:12:07,417
That felt good!

213
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:09,419
The sea certainly is wonderful.

214
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:12,422
It is! It makes you forget all the unpleasant things!

215
00:12:12,422 --> 00:12:13,823
You're right.

216
00:12:13,823 --> 00:12:16,826
The sea does do that.

217
00:12:16,826 --> 00:12:19,529
It hides everything.

218
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:21,331
"Nagisa Isogai (27), Passenger" -Painful memories,

219
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:23,833
the uncertain future,

220
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,836
and even corpses.

221
00:12:26,836 --> 00:12:28,738
What?

222
00:12:28,738 --> 00:12:30,240
Did you say corpses?

223
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,943
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said such a horrible thing.

224
00:12:33,943 --> 00:12:39,249
My father drowned awhile back. I can't help thinking of it.

225
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:40,850
I'm sorry to hear that.

226
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:46,256
We've all got to be grateful to Mr. Furukawa got sponsoring this tour.

227
00:12:46,256 --> 00:12:49,159
I know who he is!

228
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:51,561
Remember that seal I picked up?

229
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:53,563
That's when I saw it.

230
00:12:53,563 --> 00:12:55,565
The name Furukawa was on it.

231
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:57,267
Conan, you saw it too, didn't you?

232
00:12:57,267 --> 00:12:58,568
Yes.

233
00:12:58,568 --> 00:13:01,571
So that's why you thanked him back then.

234
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:02,972
That's right!

235
00:13:02,972 --> 00:13:04,974
You see!

236
00:13:04,974 --> 00:13:09,479
That man with the seal is Mr. Furukawa!

237
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:12,282
I'm sure he intends to reveal his identity during dinner

238
00:13:12,282 --> 00:13:14,584
and surprise everyone.

239
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:16,486
That's strange.

240
00:13:16,486 --> 00:13:18,488
I asked him his name

241
00:13:18,488 --> 00:13:20,990
and I'm positive he said it was Kameda.

242
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,493
You're kidding!

243
00:13:23,493 --> 00:13:25,995
Hey, Mouri! They're announcing dinner!

244
00:13:25,995 --> 00:13:27,797
All right, thank you!

245
00:13:31,401 --> 00:13:35,705
So you're the famous Sleeping Kogoro.

246
00:13:35,705 --> 00:13:37,007
That's right.

247
00:13:37,007 --> 00:13:39,709
What an honour.

248
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,813
I'm going back to my room and rest for a bit.

249
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:47,517
You still get seasick, I see.

250
00:13:47,517 --> 00:13:49,519
May I pour you more wine?

251
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,021
Yes, thank you!

252
00:13:51,021 --> 00:13:55,225
This ship is so huge and there are so few passengers on board,

253
00:13:55,225 --> 00:13:57,427
it seems like such a waste.

254
00:13:57,427 --> 00:13:59,129
I agree with you!

255
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:02,132
Counting the two passengers resting in their rooms,

256
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,833
there's only eleven of you on board.

257
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,635
That's if you include me!

258
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:07,137
The two passengers you're talking about

259
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:10,040
is that the other private investigator and the old man?

260
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,944
-Yes! -I passed that old man in the corridor.

261
00:14:14,944 --> 00:14:18,348
He seems to be the quiet type. What does he do?

262
00:14:18,348 --> 00:14:23,053
Well, it seems he's a marine researcher

263
00:14:23,053 --> 00:14:27,957
and his name is Saizo Kano.

264
00:14:27,957 --> 00:14:30,660
Kano Saizo?

265
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,178
Where is his room?

266
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,980
His room number is 101.

267
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,384
Saizo Kano? I've heard that name somewhere before.

268
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,986
You idiot! How could you forget?

269
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:50,090
Many years ago, you and I both were after him,

270
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,093
he was the mastermind behind the 400 million yen heist.

271
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:56,796
"Saizo Kano" -He is Saizo Kano, the Mastermind in the shadows!

272
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,019
You have the master key, don't you?

273
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,020
Yes!

274
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:28,128
Listen, if it's him, he may have a gun.

275
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,031
As soon as you open the door, get out of the way!

276
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,432
Yes, sir!

277
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:36,136
Don't worry! Please calm down.

278
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:43,843
I've unlocked it.

279
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:45,345
Let's go!

280
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,054
What is this?

281
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:57,857
Strange, it looks like no one's been inside.

282
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,361
Are you sure this is the room?

283
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:03,663
Yes! There's no mistake!

284
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,165
Darn it!

285
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,666
I'll look on the lower deck!

286
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,569
Mouri, you check the upper!

287
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:10,770
Yes, sir!

288
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,073
"Engine Room"

289
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,478
Hey!

290
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,180
Where are you?

291
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,182
I know you're in here!

292
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:24,484
I read the letter!

293
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,189
Hey!

294
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:39,199
If he's not in the room, then he could be on the deck.

295
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,401
Who is in the room next door, 102?

296
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,803
It's the other private investigator's room.

297
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:48,508
He hasn't been out of his room since he boarded the ship.

298
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,211
That sounds pretty suspicious.

299
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:54,914
Excuse me, sir, may I come in?

300
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:55,915
Sir.

301
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,218
Here, let me do it.

302
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:03,223
Hey, you! I know you're in there!

303
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:06,326
Answer me! Hey!

304
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:07,827
Guess we have no other choice.

305
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,529
Will you unlock this door too?

306
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,930
Be quiet!

307
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,533
What's the entire racket about?

308
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:17,537
What? Mr. Mouri?

309
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,939
What are all of you doing here?

310
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:23,243
That's what I'd like to ask you.

311
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,845
Mastermind in the shadows?

312
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:29,249
Now that you mention it, my dad told me about it

313
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:31,851
when I was a kid.

314
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:34,854
His real name's Saizo Kano.

315
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:42,062
He was the mastermind behind the 400 million yen heist 20 years ago.

316
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,664
The plan was perfectly calculated, nothing went wrong.

317
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,866
The job went off without a hitch

318
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,568
and they escaped the police so smoothly.

319
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:51,871
He was called "Mastermind in the shadows".

320
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,275
He was a loner. He changed partners with every job.

321
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:59,579
His trademark was he never hurt anyone during the crime.

322
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,982
But then during the robbery 20 years ago,

323
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:05,285
he killed his first victim.

324
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:08,988
And since that incident, he was never heard of again.

325
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:12,292
You mean that fellow was sleeping in the room next to mine?

326
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:14,794
Yes, but when we got there, he was long gone.

327
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:17,797
Mr. Samezaki is looking for him now.

328
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:22,102
That's real strange, I'm sure he was dead.

329
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,503
They found his clothes washed up on some beach,

330
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:26,206
there were bullet holes in them and bloodstains too.

331
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,907
My father told me that.

332
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:30,610
He's not dead!

333
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,314
That coat was planted to fool the police.

334
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:40,120
He wasn't the kind of guy who'd die that easily, kid.

335
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,122
I thought that he and his partners

336
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,924
were out there counting their money somewhere.

337
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,526
Who would have thought...

338
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:49,129
he'd be on the same ship?

339
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:52,632
But the statute of limitations on that case ran out 5 years ago.

340
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,334
Even if you caught up with them, you can't do a thing.

341
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,836
Idiot! Did you forget?

342
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,339
The statute of limitation for murder is 15 years.

343
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:02,942
But in a civil case, the statute of limitations is 20 years!

344
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,645
If you're ordered to return the money, you have to!

345
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,247
That's right. Unfortunately,

346
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:10,550
the statute of limitations has run out for Kano's arrest,

347
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,753
but his three partners can still be arrested.

348
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:17,957
If we can find Kano and make him tell us where the others are,

349
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:21,361
we can get the money back somehow.

350
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:25,965
There's a possibility his partners are on this ship too, isn't there?

351
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:28,468
Then when we get to Ogasawara,

352
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:31,171
let's notify the police and get them to help us search the ship.

353
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,173
After all, we're out at sea,

354
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,675
they can't get away so easily.

355
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,978
You fool! There's no time!

356
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:42,682
Like I said, today's a special day.

357
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:46,586
Tomorrow is the 20th anniversary of that robbery!

358
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:48,388
At exactly midnight tonight,

359
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:50,590
the statute of limitations will run out and they'll be free men.

360
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,592
Nobody can touch them after that!

361
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:55,795
You mean, in just two hours...

362
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:58,598
The statute limitations on the crime will run out completely?

363
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:01,701
What? Is that you, Hattori?

364
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,104
Hi, Ran, long time no see.

365
00:20:04,104 --> 00:20:05,705
What's going on?

366
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,008
I didn't know you were on this ship too.

367
00:20:08,008 --> 00:20:10,010
Yes, I was sleeping peacefully in my cabin

368
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,412
when this old guy came banging on my door.

369
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:14,814
Is Kazuha with you too?

370
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:18,818
Why bring her name up? She's not my girlfriend or anything!

371
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:21,821
We're not as close as you two!

372
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:23,723
What? Who are you talking about?

373
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:28,528
Well, I mean you and your dad, you're so close.

374
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:30,930
Don't get personal!

375
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,233
Did you find him, Mr. Samezaki?

376
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,435
That shadow man you were talking about.

377
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:39,039
No, your father and I were just leaving to continue the search!

378
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,741
All right. We'll be in the restaurant downstairs!

379
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:45,945
Hey, wait a minute! We've got to help them.

380
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:49,749
What did you say? Are you telling me to wait all by myself

381
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,651
when there's a dangerous man lurking somewhere on board?

382
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:53,753
Well... no.

383
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,755
All right, Dad. I'll just wait for you.

384
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,857
Okay!

385
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:00,360
I'll be waiting!

386
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:05,465
I'll be waiting, Dad!

387
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:06,966
Darn it!

388
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:10,470
Is something wrong, sir?

389
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,473
No, it's nothing!

390
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:17,477
All right, let's start from the top deck and work our way down.

391
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:18,678
Sure.

392
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,080
I would never have thought

393
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,980
that you were interested in dolphins!

394
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,590
Dolphins?

395
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:36,290
Didn't you come here after reading the advertisement in the newspaper?

396
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:40,700
No, I'm here because I got a strange letter!

397
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,200
A strange letter?

398
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Yes, about a week ago,

399
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,210
I received a letter telling me to come to Ogasawara for a case.

400
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:53,610
They enclosed 100,000 yen as an advance.

401
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,810
100,000 yen?

402
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,810
That's right, but it was pretty weird,

403
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,020
all the bills were the old design

404
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,120
and there was no return address.

405
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,820
What about a name?

406
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,920
Masaru Furukawa was written.

407
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,120
-Furukawa? -Furukawa?

408
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,220
You know who he is?

409
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,830
What are you talking about?

410
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,430
Furukawa is the name of the man who planned this whole tour!

411
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,130
Is that so?

412
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,830
I had no idea.

413
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,230
The letter told me I'd be able to get aboard

414
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,840
if I showed the bill at the gate. That's all.

415
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,540
So you were invited on board to work as a private investigator.

416
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,740
I've never taken a job where I got paid first,

417
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,450
so I intended to return the money personally.

418
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,250
That's why I got on board.

419
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,650
Besides, I was pretty interested in what kind of case it was.

420
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,550
But what a coincidence!

421
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:39,050
Here we are, all on the same ship!

422
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,860
Actually, I called you when I got to Haneda Airport.

423
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,860
I thought I'd ask Kudo...

424
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,460
I mean, Mr. Mouri to come with me.

425
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,160
But no one answered the phone.

426
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,870
We must have just left.

427
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,870
But here we are anyway.

428
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,170
That's why they say monkeys will attract monkeys

429
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:59,270
and private investigators will attract their lot too!

430
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,980
Right, kid?

431
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,980
So you're the other private investigator?

432
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,780
You're awfully young.

433
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,780
Well, yes!

434
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,990
So, have you found that so called Saizo Kano fellow?

435
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,790
No, I think they're still looking for him.

436
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,390
Hey!

437
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,700
You want to use this?

438
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,000
Thanks, I appreciate it.

439
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,700
No problem.

440
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,800
Hey, why don't we all play some poker?

441
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,510
We can go to the lounge over there.

442
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,810
Good idea, but what about cards?

443
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:36,210
Don't worry, I brought a deck with me.

444
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,710
How about you fellows?

445
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,020
You look like you need some entertainment.

446
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,720
-Find him? -No, he isn't anywhere.

447
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,120
Where'd this jerk disappears to?

448
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,730
Darn, we have less than an hour.

449
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,530
-Mouri. -Yes!

450
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:58,530
I'm not giving up.

451
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:02,540
Not on this case, not until the very last second.

452
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,540
I swear!

453
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,850
Superintendent Samezaki! Let's search one more time!

454
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,450
Yes, you're right.

455
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,250
Let's go over the ship one more time, Mouri!

456
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,250
Yes, sir!

457
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,450
Full house!

458
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,460
Gosh, you won again.

459
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,560
All right...

460
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,060
After the next game, whoever has the lowest score

461
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,060
will change places with Mr. Kujirai.

462
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,070
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?

463
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,970
Yes, it's 11:55 pm.

464
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:38,670
You've been asking the time so many times,

465
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,180
are you expecting something?

466
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,280
It's just that tomorrow is a very special day.

467
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,180
There, two pairs aces and nines.

468
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,980
Wait...

469
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,990
I'm the loser.

470
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,090
All right, Mr. Kujira's turn.

471
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:56,990
All right, miss, be gentle with me.

472
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,900
Hey, when you said tomorrow's a special day,

473
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,900
did you mean the anniversary of your girlfriend's death?

474
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,900
What?

475
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,210
Your cocktail.

476
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,910
It's a Bloody Mary, isn't it?

477
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:18,310
Don't tell me it's the day a Princess you adored passed away.

478
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:21,320
No, nothing like that!

479
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,120
Dad! Did you find him?

480
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,530
He's nowhere to be found.

481
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,530
Where's the former Superintendent of Police?

482
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:36,530
He says he'll search until times up.

483
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,630
Would you like something to drink?

484
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,240
Water.

485
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,540
Yes, sir.

486
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,240
I guess I'll be calling it quits soon.

487
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,640
That's it for me too.

488
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,940
Yes, me too.

489
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,550
All right, after we're done,

490
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,350
I'll fix the cards and bring them to your room later.

491
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,950
I'd appreciate that.

492
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,650
How much is my bar tab?

493
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,360
-Let's see. You had two martinis. -I'll pay my bill too.

494
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,160
What? My wallet's...

495
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,460
Could this be yours?

496
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,960
Yes, it is. That's mine.

497
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,370
It was on the floor in the corridor, so I picked it up!

498
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:13,770
Come on! I haven't taken anything!

499
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:17,370
Sorry, but I just want to be sure.

500
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,680
Are you quitting too, Mr. Kujirai?

501
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,580
No, I'm just going to the toilet.

502
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,980
Let's take a break, I'll be back soon.

503
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:56,310
Time's run out.

504
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:59,410
We can't touch that case now.

505
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:03,020
But since I retired two years ago,

506
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,720
I have no authority anyway.

507
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,020
Sir.

508
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,330
Can I still get a drink?

509
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,030
Sure, no problem.

510
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,530
Give me a beer.

511
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:16,730
Yes, sir!

512
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,940
You did your best, sir.

513
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,740
Mouri!

514
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,950
Come on!

515
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,150
Mouri, let's drink up!

516
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,850
All right! I'm with you all the way!

517
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,450
The drinks are on me!

518
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:39,450
-Gosh, that's generous of you. -I realise it was his case

519
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,460
but isn't he taking it a little too personal?

520
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,860
But just like always...

521
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,770
What was that?

522
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,370
It came from outside. The upper deck!

523
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,570
A gunshot?

524
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,670
Mouri! What time is it?

525
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,970
12:08 am!

526
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,680
The flag!

527
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,790
The flag's burning!

528
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,390
Hey, what was that?

529
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,490
It sounded like fireworks.

530
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,890
Hey, Kudo.

531
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,590
Do you think this just some prank?

532
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,200
No. Look at that, Hattori.

533
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,100
What?

534
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,800
What is this?

535
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,000
Something's written on it!

536
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,010
Don't touch the knife!

537
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:33,410
Who are you talking to? I'm no amateur!

538
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,910
Excuse me, go and get me a plastic bag.

539
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,010
Yes, sir!

540
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,820
Do you always carry those things around?

541
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,220
Old habits are hard to break!

542
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,320
What's written on it?

543
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,730
"Poseidon, the God of the Sea gave me life,"

544
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,730
"thus my shadow is resurrected."

545
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:59,030
-Mr. Kujirai? -He... he's alive.

546
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,040
I knew it. That guy is...

547
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,740
That guy is...

548
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,040
alive!

549
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,750
-What is that? -What is that?

550
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,150
What's happened?

551
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,150
Captain! Explosion on the stern!

552
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,150
Stop all engines! Extinguish the flames!

553
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,850
Stop all engines!

554
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,660
What happened?

555
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,060
There was an explosion at the stern this time!

556
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,060
-What? -What's on fire?

557
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,460
This is the box the emergency escape ladder is kept it.

558
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,470
But why would anyone do this?

559
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,370
A body!

560
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:38,070
Somebody's being burned!

561
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:50,670
Darn, it's burnt to a crisp.

562
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:55,570
It's so bad we determine the time of death or identify the victim.

563
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:59,570
It's possible the victim is Saizo Kano,

564
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:02,470
the man who disappeared from the ship.

565
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,570
We can't say for sure until we do a thorough investigation.

566
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,270
I think it could be Mr. Kanie.

567
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:13,370
Look at the wristwatch he's wearing.

568
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,970
When I asked him for the time,

569
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:19,270
I'm pretty sure that was the watch he had on.

570
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,370
Now that you mention it.

571
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:25,970
Although it's badly burned, that looks like the sweater he was wearing.

572
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:29,670
Those slacks look like the ones he was wearing.

573
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:33,970
How awful. Why would anyone kill Mr. Kanie?

574
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,870
It's pretty funny though.

575
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,570
Funny?

576
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:42,070
Just look at him, looks how he's posed.

577
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,670
His upper body and his arm is raised,

578
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:47,670
it looks like he's deliberately trying to show us his watch.

579
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:51,170
-Let me explain... -It's heat stiffening!

580
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:53,270
When a body is burning,

581
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:57,270
the heat causes the skeletal muscles to coagulate and shrink.

582
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,170
"Heat Stiffening" -The result is heat stiffening!

583
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:01,670
There are more muscles to bend the arms and legs

584
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,470
rather than stretch them.

585
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:06,670
And the joints begin to bend halfway

586
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:11,270
and the result is the body looks like it's in a boxer's fighting position.

587
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:15,870
So you see, the body gets into that position quite naturally!

588
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:18,670
Is that so?

589
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:21,670
But the important question is his watchband.

590
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:24,970
Watchband? What about it?

591
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,570
Take a good look, it's unbuckled, isn't it?

592
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:32,970
That doesn't mean anything. See the can near the victim's feet?

593
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:38,570
That explosion was probably set off with the gasoline in this can.

594
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:40,770
The explosion was powerful enough to destroy the can,

595
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:43,170
it probably blew the watch loose.

596
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,470
You're probably right.

597
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:48,370
It was must've also blown the plastic sheet off.

598
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,470
Plastic sheet?

599
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:54,770
Well, when we came here looking for Kano,

600
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,470
it was on the box.

601
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,670
Just like that one.

602
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:03,270
And then? You did look inside the box, didn't you?

603
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:07,270
No, as you can see, the box is tied securely from the outside,

604
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:10,270
I didn't think anyone could hide inside.

605
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:14,870
Besides, no one was inside the box.

606
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:19,770
When I got back to the lounge, Mr. Kanie was still there.

607
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,870
Hey, Mouri.

608
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,470
Who is that smart aleck kid?

609
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,970
His name is Heiji Hattori.

610
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,670
His father is the Chief of Police of the Osaka Metropolitan Police.

611
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:32,070
You mean, he's Heizo's kid?

612
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,670
No wonder he knows so much.

613
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:37,170
So you know the Chief of Police?

614
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:41,470
Yes, we sparred with each other quite often during kendo practice.

615
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:44,670
But I was no match for him.

616
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,670
Hey, Hattori!

617
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:50,370
Look at that strange thing on his face.

618
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:52,970
What?

619
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:57,070
It... It's silicone!

620
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:01,570
Yes, the material is polygemethylcyclosun,

621
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,670
commonly known as silicone!

622
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:06,670
The fire warped it but these things are widely used in plastic surgery

623
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:08,970
to heighten the bridge of the nose.

624
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:12,570
So that means this fellow had changed his looks.

625
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:15,570
Yes, I'm sure about it!

626
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:18,270
Excuse me.

627
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:20,470
We'll cover him with this.

628
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,670
Why would he have plastic surgery?

629
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,970
Well, maybe he is one of the four

630
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:30,770
who pulled off the 400 million yen robbery.

631
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:33,670
He could've been part of the gang.

632
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,470
If the victim really is Mr. Kanie,

633
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,670
then there's a strong possibility Mr. Kameda is also part of the gang.

634
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:41,970
They seemed to get along so well.

635
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,670
It seemed like a get-together between friends who'd had plastic surgery

636
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:47,170
and hadn't seen each other since then.

637
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,570
Which means the other partner is...

638
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,570
it could be Kujirai, he seemed so interested in the case

639
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:53,570
and he looks very nervous.

640
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:56,570
He seems a likely candidate.

641
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,570
You may be right.

642
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:02,970
He acted a little strange when Mr. Kanie gave him his lighter.

643
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:05,670
And another thing bothers me,

644
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:09,170
it's what he shouted on the upper deck.

645
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:11,970
He is alive.

646
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:16,370
That guy is alive!

647
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:21,870
It was so obvious, he panicked when he saw the knife through the bill!

648
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,970
The writing on the bill said,

649
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:27,170
"Poseidon, the God of the Sea gave me life,"

650
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:30,170
"thus my shadow is resurrected."

651
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,970
The "shadow" is referring to Saizo Kano,

652
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,170
the Mastermind in the shadows

653
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:39,770
and "resurrected", means he was once killed somewhere!

654
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:45,170
He was probably killed by his three partners in that robbery

655
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:50,170
and then he took on the identity of the mysterious old man.

656
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,670
But I don't understand,

657
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,470
not just about the identity of the old man

658
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:57,070
who disappeared from the ship,

659
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,270
but why do all three of the men involved in the robbery

660
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:02,070
have to be on the same ship on the day the statute of limitations runs out?

661
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:04,670
And putting out that strange advertisement to boot?

662
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,970
And I'm curious about that fellow,

663
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:09,970
Masaru Furukawa who put out that advertisement.

664
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:13,970
Is that the real name of one of the robbers? Or is it...

665
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:17,670
Anyway, that old man holds the key to the mystery.

666
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:20,670
I'll bet we'll find a lot of skeletons when we rattle the closet.

667
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,670
Yes.

668
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,970
What? You don't remember?

669
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:27,570
I hear you very clearly on the upper deck!

670
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,770
You said "I knew it, that guy is alive!"

671
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:32,170
Did I say that?

672
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,870
Don't play games with me!

673
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:37,970
Come on, tell the truth, you'll feel better.

674
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:41,970
You meant Saizo Kano, didn't you?

675
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,270
I... I don't know.

676
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,770
I don't know anything!

677
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,370
I really don't!

678
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,770
We're not getting anywhere!

679
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,670
Sir!

680
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,670
I've talked to the crew members!

681
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:58,070
And, how did it go?

682
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:00,870
All their alibis are perfect.

683
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:04,170
At the time of the explosion,

684
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,770
excluding us passengers, all the crew members,

685
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:09,270
including the Captain were always working in a group.

686
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,970
And since the explosion took place

687
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,270
after we heard what sounded like a gunshot

688
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,770
and ran up to the upper deck,

689
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:18,970
it means the only person capable of starting the fire

690
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,970
is someone who wasn't with us on the deck.

691
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,170
So it must be Saizo Kano,

692
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:26,270
he's the only one we can't account for.

693
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:28,870
No, there's one other person, isn't there?

694
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:32,170
Well, Mr. Kameda, he went back to his cabin

695
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:33,870
because he wasn't feeling well.

696
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:36,670
No one's seen him since then.

697
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,470
Now that you mentioned it...

698
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:42,170
Hurry down to his cabin right now and bring him here!

699
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,870
Yes, sir!

700
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,770
Okay! I'm going with him!

701
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,270
-Me too! -Wait...

702
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,970
Wait for me! I'm going with you!

703
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,650
Yes, I understand.

704
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,650
I'll see you there then.

705
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,050
Yes, sir!

706
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,150
Continue on to Ogasawara!

707
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,150
Aren't we turning back, Captain?

708
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:10,150
No, they're sending a helicopter out first thing in the morning.

709
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:14,550
Our ship is loaded with cargo, they need on the island.

710
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,050
And as soon as they're ready,

711
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:18,050
the Coast Guard will also send their boat out.

712
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:22,250
So those detectives will have to do their best until help arrives.

713
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:25,450
Start engines! Raise speed up to 20 knots!

714
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:28,450
-Start engines! -Start engines!

715
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,950
Mr. Kameda.

716
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,750
Mr. Kameda.

717
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:39,050
Seems like he's not in. Hey! Go and borrow the master key again.

718
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,650
What? It's not locked.

719
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,450
Mr. Kameda, I'm coming in.

720
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,350
What's this?

721
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,920
It looks like no one's in.

722
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:56,550
If so, we'd better hurry and report this to Mr. Samezaki.

723
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,550
Isn't that right, Heiji?

724
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:04,050
Hey, where are you?

725
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:07,050
Hattori? Conan?

726
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,950
How'd it go? You find anything?

727
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:54,050
Yes, in the engine room below.

728
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:56,150
There was a little blood on the floor

729
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:58,150
and I found empty shell casings

730
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:01,150
and this strange letter.

731
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,650
I found a suspicious piece of paper too.

732
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:06,250
It was crushed up and thrown away though.

733
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,250
Where'd you find it?

734
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,450
You know the toilet at the entrance to the restaurant,

735
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:11,450
it was in the trash can inside.

736
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,550
Inside the toilet's trash can?

737
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:17,750
And then? What does the letter say?

738
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:21,650
"Waiting in the engine room. Masaru Furukawa."

739
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,750
Masaru Furukawa again.

740
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,950
Blood stains and an empty shell casing?

741
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:34,050
There it is! One shot to the temple!

742
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:36,950
There's no doubt about it, it's a gunshot wound!

743
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:42,050
The victim came to the engine room because of this letter.

744
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:45,750
And he was shot in the head, then put inside the box.

745
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,150
Yes, I think that's reasonably correct.

746
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,950
What about that piece of paper you found?

747
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:56,150
It was probably written on the same word processor as yours.

748
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:01,750
"Meet me at the stern, Masaru Furukawa."

749
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:06,350
This is proof that someone lured that fellow Mr. Kujirai out!

750
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:09,250
How do you know it was Mr. Kujirai?

751
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:12,050
Two of the crew members saw him.

752
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:14,650
It was past midnight, that guy looked scared

753
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:18,150
and they heard he was yelling, "Hey, I'm here!".

754
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:22,350
And when the crew called out to him, the fellow got shook up.

755
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:25,350
Please don't tell anyone you saw me here.

756
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,450
That's what he said.

757
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:30,650
Then it seems he went back to the lounge where we all were.

758
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:35,050
Those crew thought someone might show up there,

759
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:36,750
so they kept watch but no one came.

760
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:39,050
And just when they were about to return to their posts,

761
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:42,650
they said they heard gunshots from the upper deck.

762
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,850
And was that box burning?

763
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,050
Of course not!

764
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:50,950
And there didn't seem to be any timing device either.

765
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:54,650
What this means is, the killer fired a shot on the upper deck,

766
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,450
then set the flag on fire

767
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:58,150
and when he saw everyone was on the upper deck,

768
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:01,450
he snuck down here and set the box on fire.

769
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:06,750
If that's true, then Mr. Kujirai's fear is understandable.

770
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,850
Yes. After all, if he was unlucky,

771
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:12,150
he'd have been killed and set on fire here too.

772
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,050
One problem remains,

773
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:18,050
is it possible for the killer to fire the shot on the upper deck,

774
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:22,250
then come here without being seen by anyone?

775
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,750
Well, I have an idea who the killer is,

776
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:28,250
and in time, I'll be able to prove it.

777
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,550
You've figured it out too?

778
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:33,750
You mean you have too?

779
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:36,650
Then shall we compare notes?

780
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:46,150
First, the mysterious old man calling himself Saizo Kano.

781
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:50,550
Like you said, he left the ship

782
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,750
and no one noticed that he returned,

783
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:56,450
but somehow he was on board, then.

784
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,450
That's a trick set up by the killer.

785
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:59,450
-A fake! -A fake!

786
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,650
"Fake: To make it seem like. To pretend."

787
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:06,150
There are only two people who could've done it.

788
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,150
That's right!

789
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,250
What we have to look at very carefully here is

790
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:13,850
the heat stiffened body's elbows were in front of his face

791
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:16,650
and the fact that his knees were completely bent!

792
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:19,950
It proves both arms were raised

793
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:23,550
when the body was put in the box and shifted!

794
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:26,750
Only one person had a reason for doing that!

795
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,050
But that too was a ruse!

796
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,650
The real killer faked his death

797
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:34,150
and is still hiding somewhere on this ship.

798
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:37,150
What? What are you talking about?

799
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:39,650
Look at this! This watch is the proof.

800
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:41,350
What are you talking about?

801
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,650
That's the killer's trump card.

802
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,150
This is very interesting.

803
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:52,450
How unusual. Our deductions aren't the same.

804
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:56,950
Yes, this has only happened once when we first met.

805
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:01,650
All right.

806
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:04,550
Let's see whose deduction is correct.

807
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:06,150
Shall we make a contest of this?

808
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,550
-Hey! Wait up! -Oh, yeah!

809
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:09,950
Fix that watch, will you?

810
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:11,150
What?

811
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:14,450
Are you telling me to get this burnt up watch moving again?

812
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:18,650
Of course not! I mean put it back where it came from.

813
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,650
I see.

814
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:25,750
What? Kameda wasn't in his cabin?

815
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:29,150
Yes, we looked for him for a while.

816
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:32,850
You fool! I don't know so many people can just disappear!

817
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:35,650
Out of my way! I'll look for him!

818
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:43,350
I'm off to search for him too,

819
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:45,150
so I'd like all of you to wait here for just a little longer...

820
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:48,150
I refuse. You're a private detective

821
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:51,550
and the other man is a former police officer, isn't that right?

822
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:55,950
I don't think either of you have any right to keep us here.

823
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:58,150
But...

824
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:02,350
Sorry, but I'm going back to my room and rest.

825
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:03,850
I'm going too.

826
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,050
-Me too. -Wait!

827
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:09,150
You could put yourselves danger if you act rashly!

828
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:11,350
No need to worry.

829
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:15,050
We can take care of ourselves.

830
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:16,450
Right?

831
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:27,150
It has to be here!

832
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:29,950
If my deduction is right,

833
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:34,650
there has to be a place someone can hide without being discovered.

834
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:40,650
It can't be.

835
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,450
A good hiding place?

836
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:44,550
You have an idea don't you?

837
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:47,450
Some place that you usually can't get into.

838
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:50,450
Some place that's off limits!

839
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:53,550
You little troublemaker. There's a a killer on board

840
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:55,750
and you go gallivanting!

841
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,850
It was strange.

842
00:44:57,850 --> 00:45:00,150
Where's Hattori?

843
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:01,450
You didn't run into him?

844
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,050
It's wrong!

845
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:12,450
Kudo and I were both wrong!

846
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:15,750
Captain!

847
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:18,650
The ship's route is clear for the next 30 kilometers!

848
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:22,650
Okay! Raise speed up to 293 points, 30 knots!

849
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:25,050
Speed to 30 knots!

850
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:32,750
Who is it?

851
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:35,050
Who is the real killer?

852
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:53,050
Hey, didn't you hear a strange water noise?

853
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,050
Strange water noise?

854
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:58,150
A bonito probably jumped.

855
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:20,050
I know I heard it!

856
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:21,650
It sounded like something fell into the ocean,

857
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,650
it's very suspicious!

858
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:27,850
Like I told you, it was probably the sound of fish jumping!

859
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:32,550
I hear there are a lot of bonito and flying fish in this area.

860
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:37,450
Excuse me! Did you see that boy who speaks with a Kansai accent?

861
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:39,050
Kansai accent?

862
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:42,850
He came here to borrow a flashlight.

863
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:44,750
Flashlight?

864
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:48,050
That means there's a good chance

865
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:51,450
he went out on the deck to look for something!

866
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:52,850
Then...

867
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:55,650
That sound... No way!

868
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,450
It can't be!

869
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:59,250
Wait!

870
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:03,150
It's impossible! He'd never let that happen!

871
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:07,350
Hattori!

872
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:11,250
Hattori!

873
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,250
Where are you?

874
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:16,250
Answer me!

875
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:20,750
Hattori.

876
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:28,850
It can't be true! It can't!

877
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:30,850
Hattori!

878
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:35,550
Hattori!

879
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:44,450
Hattori!

880
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:46,450
Hey, kid!

881
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:48,650
You've got to be careful!

882
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:49,850
You could've fallen over.

883
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:52,850
-But... -He's right, kid!

884
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:58,250
The ocean is extremely vast.

885
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:03,650
If a person were to fall in, a mere human being

886
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:06,150
would be helpless death is a certainty.

887
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:08,550
Conan!

888
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:11,550
What in the world are you doing?

889
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:14,550
But Heiji is...

890
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:16,550
That boy again.

891
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:20,150
He's probably off somewhere looking for clues!

892
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:21,150
Dad's right!

893
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:25,150
Don't worry, he'll pop up soon.

894
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:29,450
Yoshimi.

895
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:34,050
Well...

896
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:38,050
Your voice sounded just like someone I knew.

897
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:41,350
Never mind that, what's going on here?

898
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:44,050
What are you three doing here?

899
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:48,250
She asked us to help her look for something.

900
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,450
You were looking for something?

901
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:52,050
My pendant.

902
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:53,850
I noticed it was gone just when I was going to bed,

903
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:57,250
I was looking all over for it, then I ran into these fellows.

904
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,250
They didn't look like they had anything to do,

905
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:00,050
so I asked them to help me.

906
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:01,250
There's a better chance of finding it with three

907
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:04,050
rather than one person searching.

908
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:08,050
Well, are you talking about this locket with the photo in it?

909
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:09,450
What?

910
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:11,050
The clasp was unhooked,

911
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:14,850
I found it on the bow.

912
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:17,450
Yes, this is it, thank you.

913
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:21,150
I must have dropped it this evening when I was up there.

914
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:24,550
Then is the little girl in the picture, you, Nagisa?

915
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:28,150
Is that your father carrying you?

916
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:29,150
Yes.

917
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:32,450
For goodness sakes, why didn't you return it to her earlier?

918
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:36,450
But there was a hole in her father's face

919
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:39,150
and I didn't know who it belonged to!

920
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:44,450
After all, it could have been someone else carrying their daughter.

921
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:49,150
I intended to ask who it belonged to during dinner but I forgot!

922
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:51,850
I'm sorry, I didn't realise there was a hole in it.

923
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:53,150
It's all right.

924
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:56,550
It's an old photo taken over 20 years ago.

925
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:59,450
This is the only thing I have left

926
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:02,050
to remind me of my late father.

927
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:06,650
Are you all out of your minds?

928
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:10,450
A killer is on board and you're all wandering around!

929
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:11,650
"Toji Samezaki (62)" -Mouri!

930
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:13,650
Why did you let them out of the restaurant?

931
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:15,750
Well...

932
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:18,550
They said they wanted to go back to their cabins and rest.

933
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:19,550
That's right!

934
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:22,850
You have no right to give us orders!

935
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:25,750
Besides, I didn't want to stay here anymore!

936
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:28,350
"Nagisa Isogai (27)" -Especially not with a hysterical old man!

937
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:30,350
What did you say?

938
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:33,250
If you say being alone is dangerous,

939
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:36,050
it'll be better to lock myself in my room

940
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:39,350
and spend the night playing cards with these kids.

941
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:40,350
Isn't that right?

942
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:42,050
Well...

943
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:44,250
"Sadao Kujirai (50)" -I don't think

944
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,250
"Minoru Ebina (42)" -it's a good idea to split up.

945
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:50,550
I think it's safer if we all stay together in one place.

946
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:55,550
By the way, have you found Mr. Kameda you were looking for?

947
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:58,150
No, he seems to have disappeared!

948
00:50:58,150 --> 00:51:00,350
Along with Mr. Kano!

949
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:02,350
Have you seen Heiji Hattori?

950
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:06,550
No way! Are you telling me Heizo's son is also missing?

951
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:10,250
Darn, what's happening on this ship?

952
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:14,650
All right then! I don't anyone of you to go anywhere alone!

953
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:17,250
The killer could be someone outside this group

954
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:21,250
or it could be one of us.

955
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:24,350
The killer could be lying in wait for us to be alone!

956
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:26,350
He may be right.

957
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:28,050
When we heard the first gunshot,

958
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:30,850
Mr. Samezaki was with us in the lounge

959
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:33,550
and Mr. Kujirai had just returned from the restaurant.

960
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:36,950
And right after we all ran to the upper deck,

961
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:38,750
there was an explosion at the stern

962
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:41,750
and the box with the body inside was set on fire.

963
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:45,050
We all ran up to the deck together

964
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:49,350
and even Mr. Ebina and Ms. Isogai who joined us later

965
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:51,750
wouldn't have been able to start the fire.

966
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,050
Which means that

967
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:57,150
since we can't at present identify the fire victim,

968
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:59,550
the only ones capable of setting the fire

969
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:01,350
were the men not on the deck with us,

970
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:05,150
Mr. Kameda, Mr. Kanie

971
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:09,750
and the old man calling himself Saizo Kano.

972
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:13,650
But something's bothering me,

973
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:17,350
it's the strange behaviour of the people in this group.

974
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:24,350
And Mr. Samezaki's almost fanatical reaction.

975
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,850
What happened?

976
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:31,050
What happened during that robbery 20 years ago?

977
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:40,910
I'm going to the toilet,

978
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:42,110
please wait for me!

979
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:45,410
Darn it all! If only Hattori were here,

980
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:49,610
he'd easily be able to ask Pops about the case.

981
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:51,810
Where in the world'd he got off to?

982
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:56,210
"Dr. Agasa's home"

983
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:58,610
Hello? Hey, how are things going?

984
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:01,310
What? The 400 million yen robbery 20 years ago?

985
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:03,310
"The statute of limitations of" -We were just watching

986
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:06,010
"400 million yen robbery is running out today" -a special on that case!

987
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:08,110
The statute of limitations is running out

988
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:10,410
so they've been doing a lot of specials on it since last night!

989
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:12,210
I thought you'd probably want to see it,

990
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:14,110
so we're recording it.

991
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:16,510
Did they mention something about the thieves?

992
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:18,010
Wait a second.

993
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:20,010
I'm sure there was something!

994
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:25,110
They identified the ringleader, Saizo Kano,

995
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:26,610
but as for the remaining three,

996
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:30,910
all they had were montages and no names!

997
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:33,610
Did they mention whether Kano died or not?

998
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:36,810
Yes, his blood stained coat with a bullet hole

999
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:38,310
and it washed up on shore,

1000
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:40,710
so the police deduced he was killed

1001
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:43,510
by his three accomplices after a falling out!

1002
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:47,110
But how did they know it was Kano's coat?

1003
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:50,110
In the inside pocket of the coat,

1004
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:53,110
they found a photo that he always carried on his person.

1005
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:57,110
It was a picture of him carrying his daughter.

1006
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,610
What?

1007
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,910
It certainly was a tragic case.

1008
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:03,510
The alarm went off and it scared one of the robbers,

1009
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:05,310
he panicked and fired wildly.

1010
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:10,510
One of the bullets hit and killed a teller named Samezaki.

1011
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:12,610
What? You mean someone was shot?

1012
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:17,010
A female teller, her name was Yoshimi Samezaki.

1013
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:20,310
The poor thing, she was still so young.

1014
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:22,610
Yoshimi Samezaki?

1015
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:26,310
It can't be. But it's just too much of a coincidence.

1016
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:32,910
Why are there so many people connected to that case here on this ship?

1017
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:37,710
Who is this Masaru Furukawa who sponsored the tour?

1018
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:41,410
"Masaru Furukawa" -Who in the world is he anyway?

1019
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:49,010
What was that?

1020
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:50,710
I have to go now!

1021
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:53,010
Call me if you think of something!

1022
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:54,510
Hey...

1023
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:57,310
Where'd that come from?

1024
00:54:57,310 --> 00:54:59,210
The stern, I think!

1025
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:01,110
All right! I'll go from the left,

1026
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:02,910
you go around from the right!

1027
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:03,910
Yes, sir!

1028
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:06,910
Hey! Conan!

1029
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:27,610
No one's here.

1030
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:29,110
That's impossible!

1031
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:31,110
-Look around! -Yes, sir!

1032
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:35,610
Hattori, what's happened?

1033
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:37,910
Why don't you show yourself?

1034
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:42,610
If you'd heard that sound, you'd be the first one here.

1035
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:46,210
What's happened to you, Hattori?

1036
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:52,210
Sir! Do you suppose he went this way back inside?

1037
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:55,910
It's Kano.

1038
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:58,110
Kano is the killer, I just know it!

1039
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:02,310
He's trying to confuse us by firing shots all over the ship!

1040
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:04,610
But what is he trying to do?

1041
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:07,310
It's... it's me.

1042
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:10,410
He's...

1043
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:13,010
he's trying to kill me.

1044
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:15,710
I...

1045
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:17,310
don't want to die.

1046
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:21,510
I don't want to die yet.

1047
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:25,110
Please! Protect me, please!

1048
00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:28,510
I'll tell you everything.

1049
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:35,810
Yes, that's right.

1050
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:39,310
I was one of Kano's accomplices

1051
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:43,110
in the that robbery 20 years ago.

1052
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:44,910
I came aboard this ship

1053
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:47,010
because the three of us wanted to celebrate

1054
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:50,410
the end of 20 years of hiding out.

1055
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:53,310
One of the others sent me a letter.

1056
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:55,810
He said there was no chance of being caught once the ship sailed

1057
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:58,810
because the statute of limitations would run out.

1058
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:02,610
There was an old 10,000 bill in the letter,

1059
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:05,910
but it'd been so long since we'd seen each other.

1060
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:08,510
We'd all changed our faces and our names,

1061
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:11,110
so we didn't know who was who

1062
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:14,610
until Kanie called out to me.

1063
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:19,010
And he told me our other accomplice was Kameda.

1064
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:25,010
And? So who's the one trying to kill you?

1065
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:27,810
Well...

1066
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:30,110
I don't know who it is.

1067
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:31,610
You're lying.

1068
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:34,610
It's Saizo Kano, isn't it? The man you and the others double-crossed.

1069
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:36,710
That's impossible!

1070
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:40,710
One of the others shot him to death 20 years ago.

1071
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:43,810
Then it's probably one of the others.

1072
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:46,410
He wants all the money for himself!

1073
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:49,910
You haven't used that money yet, have you?

1074
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:52,810
That's what I thought at first

1075
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:55,110
but something's strange.

1076
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:57,310
It just doesn't make any sense!

1077
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:00,910
What was that?

1078
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,310
Everyone! Get down!

1079
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:04,610
Are you all right?

1080
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:06,210
Kujirai!

1081
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:08,510
Where? Where were you shot?

1082
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:11,010
Don't move!

1083
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:17,210
You've been shot!

1084
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:19,910
Darn! Where'd the shot come from?

1085
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:26,310
Hey, kid! Get down!

1086
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:27,910
Somebody's out there!

1087
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:30,610
There! On the bow!

1088
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:32,010
You jerk!

1089
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:34,710
-I'm not letting him get away this time! -Sir!

1090
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:43,910
Hey! You've nowhere to run!

1091
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:48,010
Throw your gun down and surrender yourself.

1092
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:50,410
Hey, Kano! Are you listening to me?

1093
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:53,510
You are Saizo Kano, aren't you?

1094
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:59,610
Hey! Say something!

1095
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:03,610
This is... Kanie?

1096
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:06,610
That's impossible!

1097
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:17,850
One shot to the head.

1098
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:19,350
He died instantly.

1099
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:20,550
Yes.

1100
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:22,550
The body's still warm.

1101
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:25,050
His blood hasn't coagulated yet.

1102
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:28,350
There're powder burns on his temple, indicating he placed the gun,

1103
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:30,650
there and pulled the trigger.

1104
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,650
When the gunshot was heard,

1105
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:37,450
everyone except Kanie was in the restaurant.

1106
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:43,450
There's no other explanation Kanie shot himself in the head,

1107
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:47,750
which means Kanie who was hiding out on the bow of this ship,

1108
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:51,350
was so upset to hear his old partner

1109
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:53,850
blab about the robbery 20 years ago

1110
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:56,450
that he tried to shoot him

1111
00:59:56,450 --> 00:59:58,450
but failed to kill him!

1112
00:59:58,450 --> 01:00:00,650
But realising he could not escape,

1113
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:03,050
he gives up and commits suicide.

1114
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:06,350
What a fool!

1115
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:08,550
But...

1116
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:10,650
Doesn't that seem strange to you?

1117
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:12,850
The burnt body at the bow

1118
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:16,050
was wearing Mr. Kanie's clothes and his wristwatch, wasn't he?

1119
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:19,750
Then whose body is that anyway?

1120
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:22,550
Well, it's either Kameda,

1121
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:24,850
another of the accomplices who disappeared earlier

1122
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:27,450
or Saizo Kano.

1123
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:32,150
Either way, Kanie here was the killer.

1124
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:35,150
He disguised the body to look like him

1125
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:38,250
and set it on fire to make it appear he was dead.

1126
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:42,450
The question is, how Kanie managed to evade our search

1127
01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:45,050
and hide out here.

1128
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:47,850
What's this?

1129
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:52,250
There's something weird tied behind this guy.

1130
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:53,450
This is...

1131
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:55,450
A rope ladder!

1132
01:00:57,850 --> 01:00:59,550
No one would find this hiding place

1133
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:01,150
if you were playing hide and seek!

1134
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:02,450
I get it.

1135
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:07,150
Kanie hid here, hanging on to the ladder.

1136
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:10,850
There's some rope marks on his arms and legs.

1137
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:13,150
So I'm sure you're right.

1138
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:15,350
But I don't understand.

1139
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:18,150
Why go to all the trouble of making it look like you died

1140
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:20,850
and then hide out here?

1141
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:23,050
The only explanation I can think of is

1142
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:27,150
he wanted to surprise his next victim by appearing suddenly

1143
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:31,350
before him filling the guy with fear.

1144
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:33,050
But who was Kanie trying to kill

1145
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:35,250
that he had to go through so much trouble?

1146
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:39,250
Kujirai, who just got shot was one of his old buddies, wasn't he?

1147
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:42,650
You're right.

1148
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:51,650
Look at all the blood.

1149
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:55,150
It looks like an artery's been damaged.

1150
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:57,550
He needs medical attention right away.

1151
01:01:57,550 --> 01:02:01,850
Ran's gone to get the first aid kit.

1152
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:06,250
You are a very lucky person,

1153
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:10,250
you got off with only a hole through your coat and arm.

1154
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:12,650
Hey, Mouri, I found it!

1155
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:14,850
I found where the bullet passed through.

1156
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:18,650
I'm pretty sure Kanie fired the gun from the bow

1157
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:20,850
and it passed through the window here.

1158
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:24,550
Now all we have to do is find the bullet

1159
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:26,050
which should be embedded somewhere.

1160
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:29,850
Well, do you mean this?

1161
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:34,750
Yes, no doubt about it, this is it!

1162
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:37,250
What a sharp shooter.

1163
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,350
He missed his target

1164
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:42,650
but he fired the shot from way over there with a pistol.

1165
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:46,450
Have you forgotten? One of the men Kano hired

1166
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:50,150
to help pull off the job was very handy with firearms.

1167
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:54,050
That's right, we were able to learn

1168
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:55,850
he probably served in some foreign army,

1169
01:02:55,850 --> 01:02:57,950
but that was about it.

1170
01:02:57,950 --> 01:03:01,550
Yes, so that must have been Kanie!

1171
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:05,250
Dad!

1172
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:06,850
You got the first aid kit!

1173
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:13,850
We've got to stop the bleeding.

1174
01:03:13,850 --> 01:03:15,850
What? Where's Conan?

1175
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:17,150
What?

1176
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:19,550
Isn't he somewhere around there?

1177
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:24,050
What? A boy with a Kansai accent?

1178
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,050
He came to borrow a flashlight but never returned.

1179
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:28,350
He hasn't come to the bridge either.

1180
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:32,150
It's strange. Where could he have gone?

1181
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:35,750
Could you search everyone's cabin just to make sure?

1182
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:37,950
Sure but I doubt we'll find him.

1183
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:38,950
That's right...

1184
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:43,050
When we were looking for that Kameda fellow with Mr. Samezaki,

1185
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:45,950
we went through all the cabins too.

1186
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:47,650
Well, did you happen to notice

1187
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:49,950
if he might been searching for something somewhere?

1188
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:53,150
He is a private detective too.

1189
01:03:53,150 --> 01:03:55,150
I didn't notice anything.

1190
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:58,450
Besides, all the cabins were locked, except for Mr. Kameda's.

1191
01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:01,550
Come to think of it, there is one cabin we didn't search!

1192
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:04,750
That's right, it was so neat.

1193
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:07,150
-What? -You know, that guy with the glasses,

1194
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:08,550
Mr. Ebina, it was his room.

1195
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:11,250
There was only a trunk in the middle of the room,

1196
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:13,550
the bed looked like it hadn't even used.

1197
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:17,550
It looked like he hadn't even unlocked his trunk.

1198
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:21,650
Can you show me where that cabin is?

1199
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:24,650
Mr. Mouri asked me to look inside!

1200
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:32,050
Conan?

1201
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:34,050
Conan!

1202
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:39,750
Hey, kid.

1203
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,750
Are you sure Mr. Mouri wanted it like this?

1204
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:47,350
Yes! And he also said he didn't want anyone else to know about it.

1205
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:49,150
Quick, let's get back inside!

1206
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:51,250
That body is giving me the creeps.

1207
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:53,350
Yes, you're right.

1208
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:55,750
Go back to where the others are, kid!

1209
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:57,550
Okay!

1210
01:04:57,550 --> 01:05:00,250
This tour sure turned into a nightmare.

1211
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:02,850
I heard the killer committed suicide though.

1212
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:04,950
And that guy Furukawa who planned this tour,

1213
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:09,550
I'll bet he is waiting at Ogasawara for the ship to dock.

1214
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:13,350
Masaru Furukawa,

1215
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:15,750
the man who planned this tour.

1216
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:18,750
All the mysteries start here.

1217
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:21,450
If the killer is Kanie

1218
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:24,950
and this Masaru Furukawa is also Kanie,

1219
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:28,150
then all the pieces to this case will fit,

1220
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:30,650
but I'm still not convinced.

1221
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:34,150
There's the watch the body had on

1222
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:40,250
and that Furukawa seal Mr. Kameda had is another puzzle.

1223
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:45,350
Darn it, I wish I at least knew who this Masaru Furukawa is.

1224
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,550
Excuse me.

1225
01:05:56,550 --> 01:05:58,850
Did you see a kid that wearing glasses?

1226
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:02,550
Don't tell me...

1227
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:04,850
Masaru Furukawa is...

1228
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:13,150
A burn mark?

1229
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:17,150
And the paint's coming off on the other side.

1230
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:18,850
Maybe...

1231
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:24,150
Conan!

1232
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:38,750
Here's another!

1233
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:49,550
And other here!

1234
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:50,850
I've got it.

1235
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:54,750
That's how you can control the time and everyone's movements.

1236
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:57,850
And that's where Hattori's role as private detective fits in.

1237
01:06:57,850 --> 01:07:00,650
But why Hattori?

1238
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:04,050
He's famous in Osaka but that's all.

1239
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:07,850
Why hire a private detective all the way from Osaka?

1240
01:07:10,850 --> 01:07:12,150
Gosh!

1241
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:16,150
You're always wandering around and making us worry!

1242
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:19,150
I... I was just about to go back.

1243
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:21,350
That's why I...

1244
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:23,850
I'm begging you.

1245
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:28,050
Don't leave me alone.

1246
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:48,550
Conan, you know what a scared cat I am.

1247
01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:50,150
If you get lost,

1248
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:54,350
I'll have to search this spooky ship all by myself!

1249
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:57,150
I... I'm sorry.

1250
01:07:57,150 --> 01:08:01,150
By the way, where'd you get this tennis ball?

1251
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:03,750
I found it under the table at the restaurant just now

1252
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:06,350
while I was looking for you.

1253
01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:10,050
I asked who it belonged to but no one came forward.

1254
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:14,450
Did Mr. Samezaki say something when he saw it?

1255
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:18,650
Because he and dad went off somewhere before seeing it.

1256
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:21,150
They were talking very loudly.

1257
01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:23,350
It was something about an old bullet wound

1258
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:27,550
they found on Mr. Kanie's body.

1259
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:30,750
Where was everyone when Pops and the others

1260
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:34,850
left the restaurant the first time to look for Mr. Kano?

1261
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:38,050
They all left too, separately.

1262
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:40,650
But when they came back with Heiji,

1263
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:43,750
the others were already back.

1264
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:45,750
I see.

1265
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:48,550
I've figured everything out.

1266
01:08:48,550 --> 01:08:52,050
I've solved the mystery behind this strange case!

1267
01:09:01,190 --> 01:09:06,290
I've figured it all out, now all I have to do is prove it.

1268
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:07,890
Excuse me.

1269
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:10,990
We're looking the boy who speaks with a Kansai dialect.

1270
01:09:10,990 --> 01:09:14,690
That kid asked us the same thing and we've been looking for him too.

1271
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:16,790
But we can't find him anywhere.

1272
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:18,290
Sorry, Dr. Agasa.

1273
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:19,690
I can't talk now.

1274
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:22,990
I'll call you later...

1275
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:24,090
What did you say?

1276
01:09:24,090 --> 01:09:27,190
We'll get the entire crew to search the ship again.

1277
01:09:27,190 --> 01:09:29,190
I'd appreciate that.

1278
01:09:32,190 --> 01:09:34,690
Gosh. What are you doing here?

1279
01:09:34,690 --> 01:09:36,590
Well, nothing.

1280
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:38,790
I'm getting worried, where did he go to anyway?

1281
01:09:38,790 --> 01:09:39,890
Who are you talking about?

1282
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:41,990
Are you serious?

1283
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:44,790
Hattori, of course!

1284
01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:47,190
Him?

1285
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:51,290
He's probably swimming with the fishes somewhere.

1286
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:54,890
Mouri.

1287
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:57,990
This guy might just be...

1288
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:01,190
Yes, I know what you mean...

1289
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:05,990
Dad?

1290
01:10:09,490 --> 01:10:12,290
Pops? What's wrong?

1291
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:13,990
Pops?

1292
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:15,190
What're you doing?

1293
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:16,390
Dad?

1294
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:19,990
Ran, tell all the others to come here!

1295
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:21,090
What?

1296
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:24,290
I've figured everything out.

1297
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:25,690
Go on, hurry!

1298
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:26,690
What?

1299
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:34,690
Is that true? You've solved the case?

1300
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:35,790
That's right.

1301
01:10:35,790 --> 01:10:38,590
I've figured everything out

1302
01:10:38,590 --> 01:10:41,290
the entire truth behind this case.

1303
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:44,590
You're not going to say that Kanie is not the killer, are you?

1304
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:48,290
No, Kanie is the killer.

1305
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:52,890
Like you said, he pretended to be dead

1306
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:55,890
then lay in wait for a chance to kill his victim.

1307
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:59,190
Mr. Kujirai, that was you!

1308
01:10:59,190 --> 01:11:02,190
Then whose body is that, that was set on fire?

1309
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:04,490
It's Mr. Kameda.

1310
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:06,290
First,

1311
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:10,290
Mr. Kanie lured Mr. Kameda out and shot him,

1312
01:11:10,290 --> 01:11:14,090
then hid the body inside the emergency ladder box at the bow

1313
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:17,390
and returned to join the others.

1314
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:20,490
Then he set the flag on the upper deck on fire,

1315
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:24,990
when everyone ran up to the deck, he set fire to the box.

1316
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:27,390
The reason why he didn't change Mr. Kameda's clothes

1317
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:29,890
as soon as he was put in the box is

1318
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:32,890
he was waiting for the superintendent to give up

1319
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:35,590
the search for the old man named Kano.

1320
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:38,390
It takes a long time to dress someone

1321
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:41,690
and he couldn't risk being seen by the superintendent.

1322
01:11:41,690 --> 01:11:44,490
And the proof is the way the victim's arms

1323
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:47,490
were up beside his face!

1324
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:50,090
If you raise the arms when putting the body into the box,

1325
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:52,690
even after rigor mortis sets in,

1326
01:11:52,690 --> 01:11:55,190
dressing the body is easy.

1327
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:57,990
And the reason the watch wasn't clasped was

1328
01:11:57,990 --> 01:12:02,490
his watch probably didn't fit Mr. Kameda.

1329
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:04,490
Before setting the fire,

1330
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:07,690
Mr. Kanie called Mr. Kujirai out to the stern

1331
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:11,190
and was tried to set him up as the killer.

1332
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:14,090
Because the first person found hanging around a crime scene

1333
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:16,590
usually viewed as a strong suspect.

1334
01:12:16,590 --> 01:12:21,990
But why? Why did he have to make it look like he was dead?

1335
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:26,090
He wanted to surprise his next victim, which was Mr. Kujirai,

1336
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:29,290
and fill him with fear.

1337
01:12:29,290 --> 01:12:33,290
He wanted vengeance against the men who betrayed him 20 years ago.

1338
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:34,890
Betrayed?

1339
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:35,890
Yes!

1340
01:12:35,890 --> 01:12:40,390
That old man named Kano was also a ruse to scare the men,

1341
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:42,390
the old man did not really exist.

1342
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:47,890
Look at the wound on Mr. Kanie's body.

1343
01:12:47,890 --> 01:12:52,390
This old bullet wound is the very proof!

1344
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:54,690
You... don't mean...

1345
01:12:54,690 --> 01:12:58,490
That's right! This is the Mastermind in the shadows,

1346
01:12:58,490 --> 01:13:02,590
the man everyone thought died 20 years ago,

1347
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:05,590
Saizo Kano.

1348
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:11,690
You're lying...

1349
01:13:11,690 --> 01:13:13,990
I don't believe you.

1350
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:17,690
You're lying.

1351
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:21,590
This man couldn't possibly be Saizo Kano.

1352
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:25,090
Because Kano is... Kano is...

1353
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:29,390
He is my father!

1354
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:34,690
Your father?

1355
01:13:34,690 --> 01:13:36,290
That's right.

1356
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:39,090
Saizo Kano, the Mastermind in the shadows,

1357
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:41,990
is my real father.

1358
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:44,190
The reason I joined this tour is

1359
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:47,690
I wanted to find him who was rumoured he was killed 20 years ago

1360
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:50,590
by his accomplices.

1361
01:13:50,590 --> 01:13:55,190
I thought that maybe he was still alive,

1362
01:13:55,190 --> 01:13:58,390
but no one here reminded me of him.

1363
01:13:58,390 --> 01:14:02,090
But what if he'd had plastic surgery and changed his appearance?

1364
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:03,890
Don't be ridiculous!

1365
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:05,890
I'd recognise him no matter how he looked!

1366
01:14:05,890 --> 01:14:08,390
Do you think I couldn't recognise my own father?

1367
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:09,890
And it'd be the same with him!

1368
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:13,690
If he saw me, you'd know by his reaction!

1369
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:18,090
20 years may have gone by, but it we'd know each other.

1370
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:21,690
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

1371
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:23,890
Forgive me, Nagisa.

1372
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:27,890
I had my suspicions but I needed proof.

1373
01:14:27,890 --> 01:14:32,290
So that I could completely destroy the killer's plan.

1374
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:33,790
The killer's plan?

1375
01:14:33,790 --> 01:14:39,090
Yes, the killer rigged it to look like Mr. Kanie shot Mr. Kameda,

1376
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:41,790
dressed him in his clothes and set him on fire.

1377
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:44,690
This would make us think he faked his death.

1378
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:48,590
Then he hid somewhere firing shots leading us on wild goose chases.

1379
01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:53,690
After failing in his attempt to kill Mr. Kujirai,

1380
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:56,390
he realised he could not escape, so he killed himself.

1381
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:58,390
That was the scenario.

1382
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:03,890
It was all a ruse to make us believe Mr. Kanie was Saizo Kano

1383
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:06,090
and that the killings on this ship

1384
01:15:06,090 --> 01:15:08,090
were to carry out a vendetta against the men

1385
01:15:08,090 --> 01:15:11,090
who betrayed him 20 years ago.

1386
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:14,890
Then, you mean the killer is...

1387
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:18,590
That's right. It's someone else

1388
01:15:18,590 --> 01:15:20,190
and he is right here!

1389
01:15:20,190 --> 01:15:21,390
No way!

1390
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:26,990
Hey... What are you talking about, Mouri?

1391
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:29,390
You know for yourself.

1392
01:15:29,390 --> 01:15:31,990
When the explosion went off at the bow,

1393
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:36,190
all the passengers here were on the upper deck!

1394
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:39,190
And all the other crew members have alibis.

1395
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:40,690
Besides, you said so yourself,

1396
01:15:40,690 --> 01:15:43,690
you'd need a timing device to have set it off...

1397
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:45,490
I found it!

1398
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:47,590
I found the timing device!

1399
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:49,590
You found it? In there?

1400
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:51,690
He used a cigarette.

1401
01:15:51,690 --> 01:15:54,190
He put a can of gasoline in the box,

1402
01:15:54,190 --> 01:15:58,690
then placed a lighted cigarette on the lid of the box.

1403
01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:00,390
If you wind it with thread,

1404
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:02,990
it'll take about ten minutes for the thread to burn.

1405
01:16:02,990 --> 01:16:04,690
The cigarette will fall inside

1406
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:07,990
and a fire will start automatically.

1407
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:14,590
But then, how do you explain the four shots

1408
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:18,290
that came from the bow and the two from the prow?

1409
01:16:18,290 --> 01:16:20,990
Even then all of us here were...

1410
01:16:20,990 --> 01:16:23,190
He used a cigarette then too.

1411
01:16:23,190 --> 01:16:26,590
He probably taped some fireworks

1412
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:30,090
and a cigarette to the railing.

1413
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:35,390
After it explodes, the evidence will fall into the ocean.

1414
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:38,090
There were burn marks on the railing

1415
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:41,690
and some paint had been off, that proves my theory!

1416
01:16:41,690 --> 01:16:45,890
By the way, regarding the flag burning on the upper deck,

1417
01:16:45,890 --> 01:16:48,090
he used the same trick, first soaking the flag in gasoline,

1418
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:52,790
then attaching the cigarette and fireworks.

1419
01:16:52,790 --> 01:16:55,790
Which means, by using this method,

1420
01:16:55,790 --> 01:17:00,190
anyone could have committed the crime.

1421
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:03,890
So who did it?

1422
01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:06,390
Who did all that?

1423
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:07,790
It's...

1424
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:09,390
It's too late!

1425
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:22,990
-What was that? -There was an explosion in the rear!

1426
01:17:22,990 --> 01:17:25,290
Stop all engines! All stations check for damages!

1427
01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:26,390
Yes, sir!

1428
01:17:32,890 --> 01:17:35,390
Lower deck! Any damages?

1429
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:37,390
No damages!

1430
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:39,790
No need to worry.

1431
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:44,790
The bomb just went off about 100 meters behind the ship.

1432
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:47,190
100 meters behind the ship?

1433
01:17:47,190 --> 01:17:49,690
Was that a bomb?

1434
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:51,390
Just to be on the safe side,

1435
01:17:51,390 --> 01:17:53,990
we put it on a rubber boat which we tied a rope to the other end

1436
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:55,990
was attached to the railing on the bow,

1437
01:17:55,990 --> 01:17:58,690
then we let it out on the ocean.

1438
01:17:58,690 --> 01:18:00,690
Mr. Ebina.

1439
01:18:00,690 --> 01:18:03,890
It was the bomb we found in your trunk.

1440
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:05,590
-What? -Trunk?

1441
01:18:07,190 --> 01:18:10,690
How did you know?

1442
01:18:10,690 --> 01:18:14,390
Your room was very clean, even your sheets were unwrinkled

1443
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:16,690
and your trunk looked like it hadn't even been opened,

1444
01:18:16,690 --> 01:18:19,690
then when I noticed how concerned you were about the time,

1445
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:21,390
it made me suspicious.

1446
01:18:21,390 --> 01:18:23,490
That bomb was probably meant to kill

1447
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:27,490
all the members of that robbery 20 years ago,

1448
01:18:27,490 --> 01:18:30,190
you prepared it a long time ago, didn't you?

1449
01:18:30,190 --> 01:18:35,690
You wanted to avenge the death of your co-worker, didn't you?

1450
01:18:37,390 --> 01:18:38,390
Co-worker?

1451
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:42,090
The distinctive way he counted money,

1452
01:18:42,090 --> 01:18:44,690
indicated he worked in a bank.

1453
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:48,290
Also, he whispered the name of the female bank teller

1454
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:51,090
who was killed in the robbery.

1455
01:18:51,090 --> 01:18:54,290
Yoshimi Samezaki.

1456
01:18:55,690 --> 01:18:58,090
She wasn't just another co-worker,

1457
01:18:58,090 --> 01:18:59,990
she was...

1458
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:04,490
she was the most important thing in the world to me.

1459
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:08,590
You're the one who cried so loudly at my daughter's funeral?

1460
01:19:08,590 --> 01:19:10,590
Yes, that's right!

1461
01:19:10,590 --> 01:19:13,490
After the funeral, I quit the bank

1462
01:19:13,490 --> 01:19:15,490
and I've been going from job to job ever since,

1463
01:19:15,490 --> 01:19:18,490
looking for those killers in my own way!

1464
01:19:18,490 --> 01:19:20,790
Even after the statute of limitations ran out!

1465
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:25,490
I see. So it was you.

1466
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:30,990
So you're the special person she asked me to meet.

1467
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:33,490
If only you...

1468
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:35,490
If only you... that day...

1469
01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:39,090
If only you'd come to the bank like you promised!

1470
01:19:39,090 --> 01:19:42,490
She... she'd probably...

1471
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:48,290
Forgive me.

1472
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:51,090
One of my men was stabbed that day.

1473
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:55,390
I heard about what happened when I was at the hospital.

1474
01:19:57,490 --> 01:20:00,590
You saw that advertisement in the newspaper

1475
01:20:00,590 --> 01:20:02,890
and joined the tour too, didn't you?

1476
01:20:02,890 --> 01:20:06,490
Yes, I thought this might be it.

1477
01:20:06,490 --> 01:20:07,990
If I was wrong,

1478
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:11,990
I intended to throw the trunk into the ocean before the bomb went off.

1479
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:18,090
So it was you?

1480
01:20:18,090 --> 01:20:22,290
Did you kill all those men involved with the robbery?

1481
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:24,290
What? No!

1482
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:26,090
I didn't do it!

1483
01:20:26,090 --> 01:20:28,590
I just brought a bomb with me!

1484
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:30,490
I didn't know anything about the guns!

1485
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:32,790
It's the truth! Please believe me!

1486
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:35,390
It's all right. I know it.

1487
01:20:35,390 --> 01:20:38,790
I know you're not the killer.

1488
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:43,590
Like I said before, to set Mr. Kanie up as the killer,

1489
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:48,990
one had to make this seem like Saizo Kano's act of vengeance,

1490
01:20:48,990 --> 01:20:51,790
or it wouldn't seem plausible.

1491
01:20:51,790 --> 01:20:54,090
The reason the killer disguised himself as an old man,

1492
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:56,590
then left the ship and returned as someone else is,

1493
01:20:56,590 --> 01:21:00,990
he wanted to create the illusion that Saizo Kano was alive.

1494
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:05,690
He left a message on the bill hinting of Kano on the upper deck.

1495
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:08,290
This was all part of his plan to make us think

1496
01:21:08,290 --> 01:21:12,390
Kano was trying to scare the men who betrayed him.

1497
01:21:12,590 --> 01:21:15,790
And all of this was so that we would think that

1498
01:21:15,790 --> 01:21:21,390
the gunshot wound on Mr. Kanie's body was the wound Mr. Kano got

1499
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:24,590
when he was shot by one of his accomplices 20 years ago!

1500
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:26,890
You mean that wound...

1501
01:21:26,890 --> 01:21:31,890
He probably got that when he served in the foreign army long ago.

1502
01:21:31,890 --> 01:21:33,990
Do you remember? One of the suspects

1503
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:36,190
was reported to have served in an foreign army.

1504
01:21:36,190 --> 01:21:40,590
And he was one of the accomplices...

1505
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:41,590
So that means...

1506
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:46,190
Yes, the only one who could use that fact in this scheme

1507
01:21:46,190 --> 01:21:50,390
is someone who knew about Mr Kanie's wound.

1508
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:51,590
You don't mean...

1509
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:54,390
One of his old partners, Mr. Kujirai!

1510
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:57,190
You're the only one, aren't you?

1511
01:21:58,490 --> 01:22:00,690
That's insane.

1512
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:05,990
First, you saw Mr. Kameda leave the restaurant,

1513
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:07,990
then you mentioned Saizo Kano's name.

1514
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:10,890
In the excitement, you went to the engine room

1515
01:22:10,890 --> 01:22:14,290
where you had told Mr. Kameda to wait and you shot him!

1516
01:22:14,290 --> 01:22:17,890
Then you hid his body in the box on the stern.

1517
01:22:17,890 --> 01:22:19,590
He was killed in the engine room?

1518
01:22:19,590 --> 01:22:22,990
Yes, I've already found blood stains, a shell casing

1519
01:22:22,990 --> 01:22:27,090
and the letter he used to lure Mr. Kameda in the engine room.

1520
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:31,190
You probably slipped the letter under the cabin door.

1521
01:22:31,190 --> 01:22:33,990
Mr. Kujirai came back to the lounge

1522
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:37,990
and waited for the superintendent to call off the search for Kano,

1523
01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:40,090
then went to meet with Mr. Kanie,

1524
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:44,190
probably in the toilet next to the restaurant.

1525
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:49,290
Mr. Kanie was probably already asleep due to being drugged,

1526
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:51,590
then you stole his clothes and his wristwatch

1527
01:22:51,590 --> 01:22:56,190
and put them on Mr. Kameda and set up that timing device.

1528
01:22:56,190 --> 01:23:00,790
After that, you deliberately called attention to yourself

1529
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:05,090
so that you had the crew to witness the box was not on fire yet,

1530
01:23:05,090 --> 01:23:09,690
and give us the impression you were called out there to meet someone.

1531
01:23:09,690 --> 01:23:12,990
The reason why you left the note in the toilet's trash can

1532
01:23:12,990 --> 01:23:15,490
was to pretend to be afraid of Kano

1533
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:20,290
so that Kanie would approach you.

1534
01:23:20,290 --> 01:23:26,290
You were probably going to say that it was in that book of matches.

1535
01:23:26,290 --> 01:23:29,190
It was all to make us believe Mr. Kanie was behind everything

1536
01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:32,790
and that he had lured you out.

1537
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:36,990
You set the cigarette device on the flag

1538
01:23:36,990 --> 01:23:39,690
before you changed the clothes on the body.

1539
01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:43,990
That way, you could run up with everyone

1540
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:46,190
when we heard the explosion

1541
01:23:46,190 --> 01:23:49,990
and we would be your alibi.

1542
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:56,590
You moved Mr. Kanie who was sleeping from the toilet to the prow

1543
01:23:56,590 --> 01:24:00,290
while we were all concentrating on the burning body at the stern.

1544
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:05,290
Then you watched our movements and after some time had passed,

1545
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:07,290
you placed another device at the stern.

1546
01:24:07,290 --> 01:24:10,590
After hearing the sound and we went running,

1547
01:24:10,590 --> 01:24:12,590
you went back to the prow

1548
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:15,990
and pulled Mr. Kanie back up and shot him.

1549
01:24:16,190 --> 01:24:18,890
And then you shot yourself and fired another shot

1550
01:24:18,890 --> 01:24:22,890
through the window into the restaurant.

1551
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:28,490
After that, all you had to do was set two more devices!

1552
01:24:28,490 --> 01:24:30,490
You came back to the stern

1553
01:24:30,490 --> 01:24:32,490
and had us all gather in the restaurant

1554
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:34,490
where you gave us your false confession

1555
01:24:34,490 --> 01:24:37,690
and waited for the explosions to go off.

1556
01:24:37,690 --> 01:24:39,790
If you fell at the first explosion,

1557
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:45,290
it would look like the shot came from the prow!

1558
01:24:45,290 --> 01:24:47,590
Wait a minute, Mouri.

1559
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:51,490
I was with him when he fell and I saw the wound right then.

1560
01:24:51,490 --> 01:24:54,690
If he shot himself earlier, there'd be more blood.

1561
01:24:54,690 --> 01:24:56,690
He used a tennis ball!

1562
01:24:56,690 --> 01:24:58,290
Before he shot himself in the arm,

1563
01:24:58,290 --> 01:25:01,790
he had the tennis ball pressed against his artery,

1564
01:25:01,790 --> 01:25:03,990
it was to stop the flow of blood!

1565
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:07,090
He held it there tightly until the explosion went off.

1566
01:25:07,090 --> 01:25:12,390
Ran found the ball under the table in the restaurant.

1567
01:25:12,390 --> 01:25:15,490
He probably threw it there in the confusion

1568
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:17,790
after the second explosion.

1569
01:25:17,790 --> 01:25:22,190
But why didn't he kill Mr. Kanie when he first took him to the prow?

1570
01:25:22,190 --> 01:25:25,990
If Mr. Kanie committed suicide right after we found the burned body,

1571
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:29,690
the killer's trick would seem unnatural.

1572
01:25:29,690 --> 01:25:34,490
The trick with disguising the body with Mr. Kanie's clothes!

1573
01:25:34,490 --> 01:25:36,690
The reason he raised the body's arms

1574
01:25:36,690 --> 01:25:41,690
and unclasped the watch was to create an illusion!

1575
01:25:41,690 --> 01:25:46,390
That's also why he hired Heiji Hattori, a private detective from Osaka.

1576
01:25:46,390 --> 01:25:52,390
Of course, Mr. Kujirai probably figured to hire us as instead.

1577
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:54,190
But you hired a private detective from Osaka

1578
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:57,190
because you lived in Kansai area, didn't you?

1579
01:25:58,990 --> 01:26:00,990
When people who live in the Kanto area

1580
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:02,890
put cards back into the case,

1581
01:26:02,890 --> 01:26:05,190
we don't use the term "fix".

1582
01:26:05,190 --> 01:26:06,990
I see.

1583
01:26:06,990 --> 01:26:10,090
Now all we need is evidence.

1584
01:26:10,090 --> 01:26:11,990
You'll probably find it

1585
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:16,390
when you check the area around the shattered glass.

1586
01:26:16,390 --> 01:26:19,190
You'll get a luminal reaction.

1587
01:26:19,190 --> 01:26:21,590
There'll be just a trace but you'll find some smears

1588
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:23,690
from when he wiped the blood that splattered

1589
01:26:23,690 --> 01:26:27,490
when he shot himself.

1590
01:26:27,490 --> 01:26:29,790
No! It wasn't me!

1591
01:26:29,790 --> 01:26:31,090
This is a trap!

1592
01:26:31,090 --> 01:26:33,690
Someone set this trap to frame me!

1593
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:37,390
You jerk! Don't try to fool us!

1594
01:26:37,390 --> 01:26:41,590
That star sure is beautiful.

1595
01:26:41,590 --> 01:26:42,590
What?

1596
01:26:42,590 --> 01:26:45,190
What? What is that?

1597
01:26:45,190 --> 01:26:48,890
What is that strange star approaching from the left?

1598
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:51,790
What is that?

1599
01:26:54,890 --> 01:26:56,190
That is...

1600
01:26:56,190 --> 01:26:58,190
Hattori!

1601
01:27:05,790 --> 01:27:07,090
That's right.

1602
01:27:07,090 --> 01:27:11,190
He can testify that you knocked him out and threw him overboard

1603
01:27:11,190 --> 01:27:14,190
when he found Mr. Kanie tied to the prow.

1604
01:27:16,590 --> 01:27:19,690
You can't deny anything anymore, can you?

1605
01:27:19,690 --> 01:27:21,590
Mr. Kujirai.

1606
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:23,890
But how did you figure it all out?

1607
01:27:23,890 --> 01:27:26,390
That Kanie wasn't the real killer?

1608
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:28,190
The watch...

1609
01:27:28,190 --> 01:27:29,890
The watch's stem is on the opposite side

1610
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:31,790
because it's made for a right handed person

1611
01:27:31,790 --> 01:27:34,690
but it was put on his left hand.

1612
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:37,690
At that point, I crossed Mr. Kanie off as a suspect.

1613
01:27:37,690 --> 01:27:39,490
You tried to make him look like you

1614
01:27:39,490 --> 01:27:43,790
but you were made a big mistake by putting the watch on wrong.

1615
01:27:43,790 --> 01:27:48,890
You were done in by your partner's expensive watch.

1616
01:27:48,890 --> 01:27:50,590
By the way, it was also Mr. Kujirai

1617
01:27:50,590 --> 01:27:53,890
who put the advertisement for this tour in the newspaper.

1618
01:27:53,890 --> 01:27:56,390
You all probably decided 20 years ago

1619
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:57,690
that on the day the statute of limitations runs out,

1620
01:27:57,690 --> 01:27:59,890
you'd place an advertisement in the newspaper

1621
01:27:59,890 --> 01:28:02,190
under the name of Masaru Furukawa.

1622
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:04,790
The reason the three got together was

1623
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:06,490
they were going to get the money

1624
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:09,790
they put into a safe deposit 20 years ago.

1625
01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:11,390
"Masaru Furukawa" -To take the money

1626
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:13,690
out of the safe deposit box you rented 20 years ago,

1627
01:28:13,690 --> 01:28:17,690
you needed the key, the seal and the signature.

1628
01:28:17,690 --> 01:28:19,990
You three each had one of the items

1629
01:28:19,990 --> 01:28:21,690
and it would also be your identification

1630
01:28:21,690 --> 01:28:23,690
when you met each other after all those years

1631
01:28:23,690 --> 01:28:25,690
and after having plastic surgery done.

1632
01:28:25,690 --> 01:28:28,990
Mr. Kujirai who was in charge of the signature,

1633
01:28:28,990 --> 01:28:33,390
saw the seal and key Mr. Kameda and Mr. Kanie displayed nonchalantly,

1634
01:28:33,390 --> 01:28:35,390
so he knew right away who they were

1635
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:38,990
and he immediately set his plan in motion.

1636
01:28:38,990 --> 01:28:40,690
I see.

1637
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:43,490
After killing them and stealing the key and seal,

1638
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:46,390
he intended to take the money all for himself.

1639
01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:47,890
What a fool.

1640
01:28:47,890 --> 01:28:49,990
The statute of limitations had run out

1641
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:53,390
and he went through so much trouble.

1642
01:28:53,390 --> 01:28:56,190
I wanted to win.

1643
01:28:56,190 --> 01:28:59,090
I thought up a perfect plan,

1644
01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:01,590
but that Saizo Kano...

1645
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:05,590
20 years ago, he said, "Your plan is full of loopholes."

1646
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:09,690
I wanted to beat the Mastermind in the shadows!

1647
01:29:09,690 --> 01:29:11,190
But I don't understand!

1648
01:29:11,190 --> 01:29:16,090
Why are there so many people involved with that case all over this ship?

1649
01:29:16,090 --> 01:29:19,390
I didn't even mention the name Kano once in the advertisement.

1650
01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:23,690
Don't you know what Masaru Furukawa meant?

1651
01:29:23,690 --> 01:29:26,090
It's the nickname Kano used,

1652
01:29:26,090 --> 01:29:28,090
he said there were just a few strokes and it was easy to remember

1653
01:29:28,090 --> 01:29:31,090
so we were to use it when we needed to contact each other.

1654
01:29:31,090 --> 01:29:33,390
No one except us is supposed to know about it.

1655
01:29:34,590 --> 01:29:36,590
This is hilarious!

1656
01:29:36,590 --> 01:29:39,890
Turn the name sideways!

1657
01:29:39,890 --> 01:29:42,390
It becomes Saizo Kano, doesn't it?

1658
01:29:44,190 --> 01:29:46,890
That's why I joined this tour.

1659
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:49,490
And also the statute of limitations ran out of that day.

1660
01:29:49,490 --> 01:29:52,290
I had my doubts.

1661
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:55,090
Masaru Furukawa was Kano's alias

1662
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:56,990
which he picked intending to be funny!

1663
01:29:56,990 --> 01:30:00,690
No way...

1664
01:30:00,690 --> 01:30:04,690
You were never any match for Kano never.

1665
01:30:04,690 --> 01:30:07,590
After all, for the past 20 years,

1666
01:30:07,590 --> 01:30:11,690
Kano had you by the coat tails.

1667
01:31:45,190 --> 01:31:47,890
What? You fell in the ocean?

1668
01:31:47,890 --> 01:31:48,890
You're kidding.

1669
01:31:48,890 --> 01:31:52,790
It's no joke! Someone pushed me from behind and I fell in!

1670
01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:55,190
Didn't you notice I was gone?

1671
01:31:55,190 --> 01:31:56,490
You're cold!

1672
01:31:56,490 --> 01:31:59,390
But you were lucky, you're alive.

1673
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:00,990
I was floating in the ocean

1674
01:32:00,990 --> 01:32:04,090
and that fishing boat captain found me!

1675
01:32:04,090 --> 01:32:07,490
It was awful! I had to take all my clothes off

1676
01:32:07,490 --> 01:32:10,290
and use my flashlight to signal ships sailing faraway.

1677
01:32:10,290 --> 01:32:12,190
Worry a little!

1678
01:32:12,590 --> 01:32:14,790
You took your clothes off?

1679
01:32:14,790 --> 01:32:16,090
Of course!

1680
01:32:16,090 --> 01:32:17,790
You can try it!

1681
01:32:17,790 --> 01:32:19,290
Wet clothes soak up so much water and they're heavy!

1682
01:32:19,290 --> 01:32:22,490
If I didn't take them off, I would have drowned!

1683
01:32:22,490 --> 01:32:25,590
The only thing I kept was my pants

1684
01:32:25,590 --> 01:32:29,590
and the thing I have no idea when it had in my pocket...

1685
01:32:29,590 --> 01:32:32,790
"Don't forget it, you fool!" -this amulet.

1686
01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:37,290
I don't know whether it really works or not, though.

1687
01:32:41,290 --> 01:32:42,290
What are you staring at me for?

1688
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:45,390
Come on now, don't play dumb!

1689
01:32:45,390 --> 01:32:48,390
You were looking at the amulet Kazuha gave you all dreamy eyed.

1690
01:32:48,390 --> 01:32:49,890
No, I wasn't.

1691
01:32:49,890 --> 01:32:52,990
This amulet's bad luck, I was thinking of throwing it away!

1692
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:55,590
But I didn't want something bad to happen,

1693
01:32:55,590 --> 01:32:57,990
that's why I'm holding on to it!

1694
01:32:57,990 --> 01:33:00,590
Then don't you ever forget it?
