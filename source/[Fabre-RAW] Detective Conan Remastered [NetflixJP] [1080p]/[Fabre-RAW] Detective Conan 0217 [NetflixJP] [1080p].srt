1
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,630
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,530
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,130
Show time again for the Metropolitan Police Department.

4
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,130
One mistake after the other is made in this eerie case.

5
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,730
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,630
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,830
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,890
Hello? It's me.

9
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,890
I'm sorry, just a while ago.

10
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,590
I guess the battery of my cell phone ran out on me.

11
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,290
Yes, that's right.

12
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,290
I got off the car and am calling from a phone booth now.

13
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,090
I should be there in another 30 minutes.

14
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,790
Okay then, I'll see you later.

15
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:52,490
"Inspector Megure's Sealed Secret (Part 1)"

16
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,490
"Haido Department Store"

17
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,590
Look... What do you think of this?

18
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,390
You're going to give it as a gift to Mr. Kyogoku, aren't you?

19
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,790
Don't you think it's a bit too cute?

20
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,090
You think so?

21
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:11,690
I think he'd look better in a simple sweater like this.

22
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,590
No, it has to be hand-knitted!

23
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,590
What do you mean it has to be hand-knitted?

24
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,990
Oh, no.

25
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,690
Sonoko.

26
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:29,290
Come on, I just thought that a hand-knitted sweater would be warmer.

27
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,090
Sonoko, don't tell me that you...

28
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:36,090
Well, I kind of wrote in the last letter to him that...

29
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,890
"I'm knitting a sweater for someone that I care for."

30
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,890
But, I didn't think that knitting a sweater took so much patience.

31
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,390
I see.

32
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,190
So, you're planning to buy a readymade, hand-knitted sweater,

33
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,290
and give it to him, making him think that you knitted it for him.

34
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,790
Well, I have no other choice.

35
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,790
I can't back off now, can I?

36
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,390
Well, all right. I give you credit for your courage

37
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,990
of telling the person that you like how you feel about him,

38
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,090
so I won't say a word about the sweater.

39
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,790
What? I still haven't told Makoto how I feel about him yet.

40
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,390
What? But didn't you write him a letter?

41
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,190
That you're knitting it for the one you care for.

42
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:17,090
Maybe he'll take it to be that you have another boyfriend.

43
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,090
That's just it. That's the point.

44
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,590
What?

45
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:25,090
If he thinks so, that'll make him feel a bit flustered, won't it?

46
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,390
Just as he's feeling that way, he receives this parcel.

47
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,890
He will think, "What's this? A parcel from Sonoko?"

48
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:36,490
And he opens the parcel slowly...

49
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,390
It was actually a sweater I was making for you.

50
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,790
This is my "Love, love strategy."

51
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,990
I won't pity you if you get dumped.

52
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,390
Makoto is so reticent that unless I do something like this,

53
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,590
I'll never find out how he feels about me.

54
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:01,090
Although I know he is always worried about me,

55
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:05,090
but I'll need a lot of courage to ask him directly how he feels about me.

56
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,090
Well, Sonoko, but...

57
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,690
Ran, how about you?

58
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,490
Do you know how Shinichi feels about you?

59
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,390
What? Well...

60
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,790
See...

61
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,990
You want to know, don't you? You want to ask him, don't you?

62
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,390
Well...

63
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,990
I guess as a childhood friend,

64
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,390
if I said I didn't care at all, it would be a lie.

65
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,990
But...

66
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,790
But! But...

67
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,290
I want to ask him, and yet I don't.

68
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,590
That's how I feel right now.

69
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,590
I hope that's not what you're thinking dream lover?

70
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,090
I... I am thinking no such thing!

71
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,390
Excuse me.

72
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:57,090
May I go over to Pops who is waiting in the parking lot?

73
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,290
Sure, then can you tell Dad head to the spaghetti shop

74
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,690
behind the department store and wait for us there?

75
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,590
Hey... How about this one here?

76
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,490
I feel like I listened to girl's talk that I wasn't supposed to listen to.

77
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,090
Oh, no. What is that? Talk about dorky!

78
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,590
Right?

79
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,790
Gosh!

80
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,890
I wonder why girls like to waste their time

81
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,790
on things like shopping and talking on the phone?

82
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,090
That's right.

83
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,090
Look at those legs of hers.

84
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:39,790
Moreover, look at that super mini skirt, despite this cold weather.

85
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,590
What?

86
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,090
A ball pen is on the ground.

87
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,090
Maybe that woman who just came out dropped it?

88
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,790
We've got to go give it back to her!

89
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,690
Excuse me, miss.

90
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,690
You dropped this.

91
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,290
Get him!

92
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,590
Hold it... Give me a break!

93
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,190
You were after a serial culprit who goes after women

94
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,290
and beating them with an object.

95
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:27,590
Right, that's why Officer Sato dressed up like that.

96
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:32,790
But, the height of the culprit was publicly announced as being about 150cm.

97
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:37,790
You can tell that I'm not the man just by looking.

98
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,490
Well, the way you approached Officer Sato was so...

99
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,990
It's not what you could call all that normal.

100
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,990
I felt a bit of danger, you see.

101
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,890
How rude!

102
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,390
We've got a bit of a problem here, though.

103
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,190
Yes, the only thing the three women victims have in common

104
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,790
is that they were dressed flashily when they were attacked.

105
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,490
That's about all we know.

106
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:07,190
The place of attack is also scattered here and there.

107
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:11,290
Will you show me the picture of the girls again?

108
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,290
Yes, sir.

109
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,890
The first victim was Ms. Ryoko Mizutani.

110
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:21,790
One night, two weeks ago, she was hit from behind

111
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,990
while she was waiting for the light to turn green.

112
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,390
Therefore, she got off her car to complain,

113
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,590
but beaten with a metal bat.

114
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,990
The next one who was attacked was Ms. Hitomi Endo.

115
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,490
Late at night, 10 days ago,

116
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,790
she was struck with a metal bat

117
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:39,290
as she came out of the restroom of the park.

118
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:42,890
And she's Michiko Ishiguro, who was beaten last night.

119
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,490
She seems to have been struck

120
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,490
right after she came out of the phone booth.

121
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,290
Don't tell me that it was that phone booth...

122
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:54,590
Yes, that phone booth that we got a hold of you at.

123
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,290
Fortunately, all three are in satisfactory condition,

124
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,290
but the only thing common we can find

125
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,590
is that they were dressed quite flashily.

126
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:06,990
They say they have no memory of anyone having a grudge against them either.

127
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,290
Well, Mr. Mouri, any inspiration?

128
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,990
Well, if I had to come up with something...

129
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,290
If you were to come up with something...

130
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:20,090
All three are mixed-race and were raised in the jungle.

131
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:29,590
Well, it's hard to think that these three are ordinary Japanese.

132
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,290
How cute!

133
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,490
Their skin is super dark!

134
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,990
The one in the middle is ultra-dark!

135
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,790
They're called "Mountain witch girls",

136
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,890
girls wearing this kind of make-up are very popular now.

137
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,490
What? "Mountain witch"?

138
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,890
No way. Don't tell me you don't know about them?

139
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,890
Don't be ridiculous! "Mountain witch", right?

140
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,290
Of course I know about them!

141
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,290
What? Where's Ran?

142
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,290
She said she had to go to the restroom,

143
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,990
and ask me wait for her at the spaghetti shop.

144
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,690
But if the culprit is indiscriminately attacking those type of girls,

145
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,490
where do we start looking for him?

146
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:10,290
Right, we haven't had this kind of case before either.

147
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,490
No, there was a similar case in the past.

148
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,190
A series of high school girls were hit-and-run.

149
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,790
Very abhorrent case.

150
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,190
That was way before I became a police officer...

151
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,790
Let's go back and investigate!

152
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,990
Yes, sir!

153
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,990
I'll act as decoy once again.

154
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,190
No! No more decoy!

155
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,090
-What? -Let's go back and check

156
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,490
if there are no other things in common with the victims once again.

157
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,890
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

158
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,490
See you, Mr. Mouri. Sorry for the mistake.

159
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,290
No problem.

160
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,490
Hello?

161
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,990
Ran.

162
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,290
What? You don't know where the exit is?

163
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,390
And where are you now?

164
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,490
What? The basement parking lot?

165
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,890
I don't believe it. How bad you can get at directions?

166
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:06,990
Sonoko, isn't that ring, necklace and bracelet the same ones

167
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,990
that the girls in the picture were wearing?

168
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,490
-What? -Where did you buy it?

169
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,490
I didn't buy it, it was given to me

170
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,490
at the department store we just went to.

171
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,090
Something about a "Millennium Sale",

172
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,590
when I showed my receipt at the exit,

173
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,990
I can choose any item for every 10,000 yen worth of shopping.

174
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,690
Hey, how about it?

175
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,990
They're wearing them!

176
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,290
Although they're only wearing one each,

177
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,190
they're the same accessories as those that Sonoko has!

178
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,290
Which means that the three girls...

179
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,990
They were customers at the same department store!

180
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,290
Hey, Sonoko.

181
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,990
What's the matter? Please answer me.

182
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,790
Sonoko...

183
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,990
Ran!

184
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,090
Hey, Ran! What's wrong?

185
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,990
-Ran, what's up? Answer me! -Dad...

186
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,890
What? A blood splattered woman is lying on the ground

187
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,790
of the basement parking lot?

188
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,680
The victim is Tae Aizawa, 20 years old.

189
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,580
She used to be a salesclerk at this department store,

190
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,180
but quit a year ago.

191
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,180
She seems to have been presently unemployed.

192
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,580
He finally kills at the fourth attempt.

193
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,580
Then, this was also committed by the same person.

194
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,880
Yes.

195
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,380
Since the characteristic of the culprit has not been made public,

196
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,880
and this is the basement parking of the department store in question,

197
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,080
so there's probably no doubt that it's the same person.

198
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,780
Then this could be the doings of someone

199
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,180
who has a grudge against the department store.

200
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,680
Tae...

201
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,380
Tae!

202
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,880
-Who is he? -He is her boyfriend

203
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,880
and was supposed to meet her in the department store.

204
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,680
"Noriyuki Shirakawa (24), Cook" -Something about his father

205
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,380
being the owner of the department store

206
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,580
and that he was going to introduce her to him today,

207
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,380
at the restaurant he is working as a cook at.

208
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,080
Who is that woman?

209
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,580
A waitress at the restaurant he works I hear.

210
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,380
"Yuri Konno (24), Waitress" -Her name is Yuri Konno.

211
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,380
She was his classmate in university,

212
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,080
and she used to give him advice when he needed it.

213
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,480
Advice?

214
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,880
Mr. Shirakawa's father seems to have been against him

215
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,980
going out with Ms. Aizawa.

216
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,580
Ran, didn't you see anyone suspicious

217
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,080
before you found the dead body?

218
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,080
There was no such person!

219
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,580
The only person I passed by was a security guard.

220
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,080
A security guard?

221
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,180
Yes, at the entrance of this parking lot.

222
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,380
A man somewhere in his forties, I think.

223
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,280
That's me!

224
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,580
"Yoshio Sadakane (43), Security Guard" -I just happened to leave my post

225
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,280
"Yoshio Sadakane (43), Security Guard" -to go to the men's room.

226
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,480
The culprit probably entered the parking lot during that time.

227
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,780
I'll bet you're the one who did it?

228
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,180
Dad!

229
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,080
I hear you working as a security guard

230
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,480
for a rival department store until six months ago.

231
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,680
"Haruyoshi Shirakawa (53)" -Don't tell me that

232
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,080
"Haido department store's owner" -they asked you to do this for them

233
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,880
in order to give us a bad reputation?

234
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,780
No way.

235
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,780
Well, Noriyuki, I guess this is a good opportunity for you to go

236
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,840
and find yourself a new girlfriend!

237
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,980
Next time, go find yourself a nice girl

238
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,980
who has no blemishes to her name!

239
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,980
Dad!

240
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,880
Noriyuki.

241
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,680
What did he mean by a girl with no blemishes to her name?

242
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,980
I think he's talking about the traffic accident

243
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,280
she caused a year ago in the parking lot.

244
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,980
Traffic accident?

245
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,380
Yes, she ran over a little boy here,

246
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,680
that's why she was fired.

247
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,680
I heard about it from Yumi in the transportation section.

248
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,680
A boy who was waiting for his mother in this parking lot,

249
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,780
ran out from behind a car and got run over.

250
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:58,280
Being in a parking lot, the car wasn't going fast,

251
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,780
but the boy got hit in the wrong place and died.

252
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:06,380
I think the boy's name was Akira Sakurai.

253
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,380
I see.

254
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,280
By the way, Noriyuki,

255
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,980
do you happen to know how tall your father is?

256
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,980
A little more than 150 cm, I think.

257
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,880
And how about you?

258
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,880
173 cm.

259
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,680
I'm 144 cm.

260
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,380
I'm 167 cm.

261
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,680
That makes the owner a possible suspect.

262
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,980
Yes.

263
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:36,280
He was capable of knowing that she'd be coming here too.

264
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,680
Excuse me, did your father come to the restaurant

265
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,280
where you were supposed to be meeting each other?

266
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,980
No, since he didn't show up at the promised time,

267
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,980
I had her go check on him to the parking lot.

268
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,680
I see.

269
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,880
Don't tell me that you're suspecting my father of having killed her?

270
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,880
Oh, no. Since a woman who was previously attacked mentioned

271
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,980
the culprit being about 150 cm, we just asked to be sure.

272
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,780
A woman who was previously attacked...

273
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,280
Then, is this the doing of that serial culprit after all?

274
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,980
Well...

275
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,680
What are you guys doing anyway?

276
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,780
You even know the height of the culprit,

277
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,280
and how come you can't arrest him?

278
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,480
If you had only nabbed the culprit,

279
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,880
Tae wouldn't have had to die!

280
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,580
Calm down, Noriyuki.

281
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,280
You police are to blame for Tae's death!

282
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,580
You police are no good!

283
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,980
Cut it out, Noriyuki!

284
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,880
No good...

285
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,280
You police are no good!

286
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,780
Why are you so surprised?

287
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,680
I'm saying I'll be the decoy.

288
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,680
It doesn't work out like in the movies, does it?

289
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,680
Inspector Megure!

290
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,480
-Inspector! -Are you all right?

291
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,880
Nothing, it's nothing.

292
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,280
I'm sorry, inspector.

293
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,680
Noriyuki's just a bit upset.

294
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,680
No problem. He's absolutely right.

295
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,580
Could we go over that side and cool off a bit?

296
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,280
All right.

297
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,380
I guess I'll get back to work then.

298
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,380
Thank you very much.

299
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,880
Well, did all the three women say that

300
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,880
the culprit was about 150 cm?

301
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,580
No, the ones who said so,

302
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,980
were the first and third women that were attacked.

303
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,680
The second woman

304
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,680
was suddenly struck from behind

305
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,280
and was passed out till a passer-by found her,

306
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,580
so she didn't get to see the culprit.

307
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,980
But, there is no mistake that the culprit is about 150 cm.

308
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,380
When we had them come to the station on a later date,

309
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:07,080
they both said that the culprit was just about their height.

310
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,180
How tall are the two girls?

311
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:16,980
Well, the first one is 151 cm and the third one 153 cm.

312
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,480
We measured them when they came to headquarters

313
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,480
so there's no mistake about it.

314
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,180
Hey!

315
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,280
Don't go talking about things you don't have to children!

316
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,280
I'm sorry.

317
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:36,280
Hey, Ran! You really saw no one suspicious?

318
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,580
No, I didn't.

319
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:41,380
I was just walking around here for a while looking for the exit,

320
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:45,280
but isn't there something strange, though?

321
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,780
What's strange?

322
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,580
That woman.

323
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,480
You think so too, Ran?

324
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,080
Right? There's something strange,

325
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,080
but I can't really say what it is.

326
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:02,980
There's something awfully strange about this woman.

327
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,380
Awfully strange?

328
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,980
Wasn't there something strange of

329
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,980
how the second woman who was attacked was dressed too?

330
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,680
This woman was attacked when she came out of the restroom

331
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,480
in the park after midnight, right?

332
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,880
That's right.

333
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,780
That's the picture that we took

334
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,680
when we went to the scene of the crime.

335
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,480
See. The restroom in the back.

336
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,480
If a passer-by found her, it means that she was alone, right?

337
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,480
But, she's wearing a man's coat!

338
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,980
That's my coat, I put it over her

339
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,180
because she looked so cold.

340
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:45,680
Then why was she at the park at night dressed so lightly?

341
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,280
True.

342
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,580
She said nothing about her jacket being taken away or anything either.

343
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,980
Come to think of it,

344
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,180
she's been in a state of confusion ever since the incident,

345
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,180
and we haven't been able to really get anything out of her yet.

346
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,680
You fool!

347
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,380
Young women nowadays to dress lightly!

348
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,380
But, she was wearing a no sleeve outfit.

349
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,980
She was dressed too light for the weather.

350
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,980
Maybe she was in a warm place to begin with,

351
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,780
and planning to go right back after go to the restroom?

352
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,780
A warm place?

353
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,380
Yes, for example,

354
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,980
like in a car or something.

355
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,980
A car?

356
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,980
Come to think of it, the first and third victims

357
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,380
were attacked when they got off the car.

358
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,280
And this fourth incident happened in a parking lot.

359
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,680
Cars are involved in all the cases!

360
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,380
Okay, Officer Takagi,

361
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,380
go check and confirm it with the second victim!

362
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,880
Yes, sir!

363
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:52,380
That sort of clears the suspicion off the owner, doesn't it?

364
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,380
No, we can't be so sure yet.

365
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,280
"Kiyonaga Matsumoto (54)" -Thanks for good work as usual,

366
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,680
"Superintendent" -renowned detective!

367
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,280
Superintendent Matsumoto!

368
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,680
Thank you for coming all this way!

369
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,780
Hey, Megure. The press is out there making a fuss

370
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,580
about this being the beginning of a series of indiscriminate murders.

371
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,680
Call it a day for now and come back again tomorrow!

372
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,980
But...

373
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,680
Let's do that, Inspector Megure.

374
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,580
We've already gotten to the point of knowing that

375
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,980
all the victims were probably riding a car.

376
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,980
If need be, I'll wear the make-up like them,

377
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,580
ride a car and try again.

378
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,680
I've already told you that I will not be using decoys anymore!

379
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,680
Superintendent. Please let me stay and investigate a bit further!

380
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,680
I know I'm close to getting somewhere!

381
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:49,980
Besides, I have this feeling that the culprit is still somewhere nearby.

382
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,180
Well...

383
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,180
Inspector Megure.

384
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,880
Don't tell me that

385
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,280
you're not dragging the you know what case inside of you yet?

386
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,880
That case that you sealed up inside that hat of yours.

387
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,880
No, I would never.

388
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,680
Really? Excuse me for the stupid question.

389
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,060
Next Conan's Hint:

390
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,740
"Thick, high soled-boots"

391
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,020
Tune in to the next episode, the secret of the hat!

392
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,200
I guess this'll be a "hat" case.

393
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,320
Inspector Megure, you mean a "hot" case, right?
