1
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,589
Today's deduction is really shocking.

2
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:26,189
So complicated and calculated like an art.

3
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:27,889
Find the answer in the snow.

4
00:00:27,889 --> 00:00:29,389
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,389 --> 00:00:31,089
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:33,389
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:03,285
"The Murder in the Hot Spring Inn (Part 2)"

8
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:08,885
Asuka went to the outdoor bath around 10pm.

9
00:02:08,885 --> 00:02:13,285
And Ema went to the shrine in the garden around 10.30pm.

10
00:02:13,285 --> 00:02:16,185
These two victims were killed with the votive dagger.

11
00:02:16,185 --> 00:02:19,485
As this murder weapon was found in the outdoor bath,

12
00:02:19,485 --> 00:02:24,185
it is plausible to think that Ema was killed first.

13
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:29,585
Plus, there were no footprints outside the shrine in the garden.

14
00:02:29,585 --> 00:02:33,585
One must pass the recreation hall in order to get to the outdoor bath,

15
00:02:33,585 --> 00:02:36,185
but nobody was seen passing there after 10.30pm.

16
00:02:36,185 --> 00:02:37,385
Oh, my.

17
00:02:37,385 --> 00:02:39,085
So these killings were done in the inaccessible spaces.

18
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:41,085
It's the Kimono visit!

19
00:02:41,085 --> 00:02:44,785
It was Sakurako who revenged herself on these girls with the Kimono Visit!

20
00:02:44,785 --> 00:02:48,285
Sakurako? Who is that person?

21
00:02:48,285 --> 00:02:54,585
She's my university friend who committed suicide

22
00:02:54,585 --> 00:02:56,885
because they framed her up for selling illegal drugs.

23
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,585
You mean Asuka and Ema did it?

24
00:03:00,585 --> 00:03:01,785
Yes!

25
00:03:01,785 --> 00:03:05,785
So, it was... it was her revenge.

26
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,185
Lieutenant Masaki.

27
00:03:08,785 --> 00:03:13,285
In the shrine, we found one of the earrings of the victim missing.

28
00:03:13,285 --> 00:03:16,085
Here. This is the one.

29
00:03:16,085 --> 00:03:18,285
That's an expensive one.

30
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:23,185
That earring probably costs at least 200,000 yen.

31
00:03:23,185 --> 00:03:25,985
400,000 yen as a pair?

32
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:30,385
It's expensive, but it's not enough motive to kill.

33
00:03:30,385 --> 00:03:32,085
True.

34
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:33,285
I remember.

35
00:03:33,285 --> 00:03:36,885
You were wearing a necklace of the same brand, weren't you?

36
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:42,185
Yes. But I took them off because Ema complained about it.

37
00:03:42,185 --> 00:03:45,885
Yes. We found this in Ema's jacket.

38
00:03:46,885 --> 00:03:52,085
We also found that the kimonos and the sashes at the homicide scenes

39
00:03:52,085 --> 00:03:54,985
actually came from the closet, which was not locked at all.

40
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,885
So anybody could take them out.

41
00:03:56,885 --> 00:04:00,885
Perhaps the murderer must have hidden them somewhere beforehand.

42
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:04,885
Okay, everyone. Could I ask you what you were doing last night?

43
00:04:04,885 --> 00:04:06,485
Firstly, Eri.

44
00:04:06,485 --> 00:04:10,985
You went to the outdoor bath around 9.30pm and came out around 10.00pm.

45
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:13,785
And Asuka just came in as you left.

46
00:04:13,785 --> 00:04:17,785
Right. After that, I went back to my room.

47
00:04:17,785 --> 00:04:20,785
I saw Mr. Mouri on the way and we had a little chat.

48
00:04:23,185 --> 00:04:26,585
We did. Actually, you looked great and...

49
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:33,385
And Yoriko, you were working on some stuff on the coverage.

50
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:34,585
So I suppose you saw Eri?

51
00:04:34,585 --> 00:04:37,585
Yes, I did. I saw Eri.

52
00:04:37,585 --> 00:04:42,285
And after five minutes or so, I saw Ema going to the backdoor.

53
00:04:42,285 --> 00:04:44,385
So that was around 10.30pm, right?

54
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:47,185
Did you see anybody else heading there?

55
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:51,485
No, I don't think so.

56
00:04:51,485 --> 00:04:55,485
Around that time, Mr. Mouri and the other three went to the outdoor bath.

57
00:04:55,485 --> 00:04:58,285
But there was a reserved sign on the door of the female bathroom.

58
00:04:58,285 --> 00:05:00,985
The door was locked.

59
00:05:00,985 --> 00:05:02,985
So both of you went back to the recreation room.

60
00:05:02,985 --> 00:05:04,485
That's right.

61
00:05:04,485 --> 00:05:05,985
Mr. Mouri.

62
00:05:05,985 --> 00:05:09,185
Did you hear or see something unusual when you were in outdoor bath?

63
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:10,785
We did.

64
00:05:10,785 --> 00:05:14,785
We heard a swash from the female bathroom.

65
00:05:15,885 --> 00:05:17,885
When was it? Around what time?

66
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:20,585
I think it was around 10.50pm.

67
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:22,485
Maybe that was when the killing occurred.

68
00:05:23,685 --> 00:05:27,185
We only heard the swash. We didn't hear a scream.

69
00:05:27,185 --> 00:05:29,185
Isn't it strange?

70
00:05:29,185 --> 00:05:34,485
Maybe the murderer stunned the victim with stun gun before she screamed.

71
00:05:34,485 --> 00:05:36,285
Really?

72
00:05:36,285 --> 00:05:37,885
It must be!

73
00:05:37,885 --> 00:05:41,385
Kid, keep out of the investigation.

74
00:05:43,185 --> 00:05:44,785
So Ran and Harumi,

75
00:05:44,785 --> 00:05:47,085
you girls were just playing ping pong in the recreation hall?

76
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:52,885
No. I actually went back to my room to take off my contact lenses.

77
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,185
Just for 10 minutes or so.

78
00:05:55,185 --> 00:05:56,485
All right.

79
00:05:56,485 --> 00:06:00,185
So nobody passed through the recreation hall while Harumi was away.

80
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:01,885
Right.

81
00:06:01,885 --> 00:06:04,785
It was around 11pm when Mr. Mouri got out of the bath.

82
00:06:04,785 --> 00:06:08,785
Around that time, Eri and Yoriko were having a meeting here.

83
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,785
Where were you at that time, Mr. Bando?

84
00:06:10,785 --> 00:06:14,585
I joined the meeting around 11.15pm.

85
00:06:15,585 --> 00:06:20,885
And then, Mr. Mouri found Asuka's dead body in the outdoor bath.

86
00:06:20,885 --> 00:06:22,985
Speaking of the paper doll of Kimono Demon,

87
00:06:22,985 --> 00:06:25,985
wasn't it there when you first came to the bathroom?

88
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,185
No. I'm sure it wasn't.

89
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:31,985
After Asuka was found, Ema was found dead in the shrine in the garden.

90
00:06:31,985 --> 00:06:34,485
Why did she go to the shrine?

91
00:06:35,685 --> 00:06:37,585
That's a good question.

92
00:06:37,585 --> 00:06:39,085
Here's the answer.

93
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:42,185
"Ema. There's something I would like to discuss with you in person.

94
00:06:42,185 --> 00:06:46,485
I will be waiting inside the shrine in the garden. Bando."

95
00:06:46,485 --> 00:06:50,485
This is ridiculous! I did not write that letter!

96
00:06:50,485 --> 00:06:54,485
But in fact, we don't know where you really were until 11.15pm.

97
00:06:54,485 --> 00:06:59,985
But what's the motive? Why would I kill them?

98
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:02,285
Speaking of motive,

99
00:07:02,285 --> 00:07:04,085
I think Harumi is the only person who might have had the motive to kill.

100
00:07:04,085 --> 00:07:05,785
No, I don't.

101
00:07:05,785 --> 00:07:07,785
I know you hate the victims

102
00:07:07,785 --> 00:07:09,685
because of what happened to your friend Sakurako.

103
00:07:09,685 --> 00:07:12,485
Besides, you went back to your room to take off your contact lenses.

104
00:07:12,485 --> 00:07:14,085
During that period, you don't have an alibi.

105
00:07:14,085 --> 00:07:17,385
No, I didn't kill them!

106
00:07:17,385 --> 00:07:19,085
Whoever is the murderer,

107
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:22,485
we have to find out how these killings happened in the closed space first.

108
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:25,785
If the victims were killed with different weapons,

109
00:07:25,785 --> 00:07:28,485
a possibility of what could've happened still stands.

110
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:29,685
But why did the murderer

111
00:07:29,685 --> 00:07:33,585
make it look like the Kimono Demon did it in the first place?

112
00:07:38,785 --> 00:07:40,285
Thanks a lot.

113
00:07:42,385 --> 00:07:44,485
We got it.

114
00:07:44,485 --> 00:07:47,385
You mean the necropsy report?

115
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:49,485
Yes. Both victims were killed with the same murder weapon,

116
00:07:49,485 --> 00:07:50,985
the votive dagger.

117
00:07:50,985 --> 00:07:52,485
I see.

118
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:55,985
The same murder weapon? Now, we are stuck.

119
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:59,385
So the murder weapons were the same.

120
00:07:59,385 --> 00:08:03,685
The bloodstain on the bandana was found to be Ema's blood.

121
00:08:03,685 --> 00:08:04,685
Other than that,

122
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:10,085
the dolls from the scene, the shrine and other areas, and Ema's letter,

123
00:08:10,085 --> 00:08:12,585
we couldn't find any fingerprints or information

124
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:14,285
that's related to the suspect.

125
00:08:15,985 --> 00:08:17,285
Thank you very much.

126
00:08:17,285 --> 00:08:20,885
You're welcome, sir. I will now depart.

127
00:08:20,885 --> 00:08:23,085
What are we going to do, Mr. Mouri?

128
00:08:24,185 --> 00:08:26,885
Nothing is found?

129
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:30,585
Next. Yesterday, we were at the Kid Sleighing Contest.

130
00:08:31,585 --> 00:08:33,485
Hey, move! Move!

131
00:08:33,485 --> 00:08:35,185
Looks like fun.

132
00:08:35,185 --> 00:08:36,485
What?

133
00:08:36,485 --> 00:08:38,785
It's the kids. The kids on the TV.

134
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:42,385
Come on! Move!

135
00:08:42,385 --> 00:08:43,485
I got it.

136
00:08:49,685 --> 00:08:51,885
That's what it was.

137
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:54,185
Now, I understand the trick.

138
00:09:02,085 --> 00:09:04,785
It's about six inches here.

139
00:09:21,985 --> 00:09:24,285
And here,

140
00:09:24,285 --> 00:09:28,585
it's about three inches under the snow.

141
00:09:28,585 --> 00:09:31,185
Six inches and three inches.

142
00:09:31,185 --> 00:09:32,885
But why her?

143
00:09:42,285 --> 00:09:44,385
Conan, where were you?

144
00:09:44,385 --> 00:09:45,485
Well...

145
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:47,685
I just went out for a walk.

146
00:09:49,785 --> 00:09:51,585
Tokyo Hajime?

147
00:09:52,585 --> 00:09:54,585
It's Mr. Bando.

148
00:09:54,585 --> 00:09:57,585
Wait a minute. Maybe that person is...

149
00:09:57,585 --> 00:10:00,985
Hey! Why are your socks all wet?

150
00:10:00,985 --> 00:10:02,385
Why don't we take it to the fireplace and dry them?

151
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:05,385
Wait. Hey, Ran! Wait.

152
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:07,585
Now, I know who did it.

153
00:10:07,585 --> 00:10:09,885
It must be that person.

154
00:10:09,885 --> 00:10:11,685
But why?

155
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,730
We have to figure out how and when the paper doll was put here,

156
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,330
if we suspect that person as the murderer.

157
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,630
What is this?

158
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,530
There was nothing there when we came here last time.

159
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,630
It's weird. This thing is kind of cold.

160
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,730
I see.

161
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,730
Is this Takagi? It's me, Mouri.

162
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:53,730
Actually, I want you to do some research on a person. Can you do that?

163
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,730
Mr. Ogura!

164
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:59,330
There's something Uncle Kogoro wants you to do.

165
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,230
What? Mr. Mouri said it? All right.

166
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:10,430
If I am right, then that person must be the murderer.

167
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,530
Mr. Mouri, you told us to come here.

168
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,030
What is it?

169
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,630
Of course.

170
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,530
We are going to find out what really happened in this hotel.

171
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,030
So you know who killed the victims?

172
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,930
Who is it?

173
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,730
Let me explain in the order of what happened.

174
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,130
Now first,

175
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:33,430
it's about Ema, who was killed in the closed shrine in the garden.

176
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,830
Lieutenant Masaki,

177
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:38,830
could you please turn on the digital camera that's on the tub?

178
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,430
I've been thinking about the picture of the footprints around the shrine

179
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,430
because there was something that kept bugging me.

180
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,230
And this morning, I finally figured out what it was.

181
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,430
What's wrong with this picture?

182
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,430
The footprints are not deep enough.

183
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,430
What?

184
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,930
Yesterday afternoon,

185
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,230
when I walked around the shrine in the garden,

186
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,430
my feet sank down about three inches in the snow.

187
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:10,030
It kept snowing the rest of the day.

188
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,930
Thus, by the time we got to the shrine around 10.30pm,

189
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:20,230
Ema's footprints should have been at least six inches deep or so.

190
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,830
However, it was about in fact only four inches.

191
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,630
It was too shallow.

192
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,430
I see. But then, why?

193
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,030
Those footprints were pressed from the top.

194
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,230
Pressed? From the top?

195
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,630
Yes, indeed.

196
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:39,230
Her footprints were found from the backdoor to the shrine.

197
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,630
Ogura and I covered every single one of them with bath towels

198
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,230
in order to preserve them.

199
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,930
But what if those bath towels were solid boards or something?

200
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,930
You could walk on it and move around the shrine

201
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:57,230
without leaving footprints, right?

202
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,130
It's that simple?

203
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,630
It seems that the tricks are always complicated,

204
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,630
but actually they're really not.

205
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,030
The murderer most likely

206
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,430
got a couple of wooden boards which are about three feet long

207
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:14,030
and moved around putting those boards on top of Ema's footprints.

208
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,630
After killing Ema,

209
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,630
this murderer went back to the backdoor doing the same thing.

210
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:25,630
This way, the footprints are maintained as it was before.

211
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,130
Except they get bit shallower.

212
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:32,830
But how did the murderer get to the backdoor, Mr. Mouri?

213
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,530
Yes! Nobody passed the lobby, right?

214
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:39,330
The murderer walked under the eaves by using the same method.

215
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,830
That's why there're no witnesses or footprints.

216
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:46,330
According to my investigation from this morning,

217
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,530
coming out from the back door,

218
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,530
the snow on the right side leave footprints about six inches deep.

219
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,130
On the left side, only about three inches deep.

220
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:57,630
Meaning that the murderer came from a room along the left side of the pass.

221
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,130
So I checked the left side

222
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:05,030
and found a place where the snow gets deeper again.

223
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,630
Where is it?

224
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,030
It was right in front of your room.

225
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,830
Eri Akechi.

226
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,030
No way.

227
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,630
Eri did it?

228
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,530
Last night,

229
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,830
Eri left the outdoor bath as soon Asuka came in

230
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,930
and went back to her room.

231
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,230
Then, you went up to the shrine from the backdoor

232
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,030
by using the method I explained just now.

233
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,730
You gave Ema a fake letter from Mr. Bando beforehand,

234
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,430
so she'd come to the shrine, then you killed her.

235
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:42,230
Sure. That way, I could kill Ema.

236
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,930
But it's impossible to kill Asuka, isn't it?

237
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,030
That's true.

238
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:50,330
You can't use the same trick in the outdoor bath on the cliff.

239
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,930
Plus, nobody passed the recreation hall.

240
00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:00,530
The truth is, it was Asuka who was actually killed first.

241
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:07,530
Eri stunned Asuka with a stun gun.

242
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:10,030
She removed Asuka's clothes and killed her with the votive dagger.

243
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:14,230
Then she threw the dead body in the bathtub with kimono sashes.

244
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:18,230
She probably stole the dagger the night before.

245
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,230
It doesn't make sense though. Because Asuka was murdered first,

246
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:26,730
yet the dagger and Ema's bandana were found in the outdoor bath.

247
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,030
That's right. That paper doll thing is, too.

248
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:34,030
That was a trick using dry ice.

249
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,830
By using a small piece of dry ice,

250
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:40,430
Eri glued the paper doll onto the crack of the ceiling.

251
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,930
If you know how long it lasts,

252
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,930
it is possible to drop the paper doll whenever you want to.

253
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,730
That's why the paper doll was kind of cold.

254
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,330
Eri asked the general manager to get her a cake everyday

255
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:57,830
because she wanted the dry ice in it.

256
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,930
I understand the dry ice trick,

257
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,930
but what about the dagger and bandana?

258
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,830
I didn't come to the bathroom.

259
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:10,230
Well, it's possible to move them without coming here.

260
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,630
Let me show you how now.

261
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,330
Yes, I understand.

262
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,130
This is...

263
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,730
These boards came down from Eri's room,

264
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,830
which is on the cliff right up there.

265
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,730
Now, I want you guys to think.

266
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,430
The votive dagger which was used to kill Ema,

267
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:51,130
and the bandana with her blood on it.

268
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:54,630
This way, you can move these things without leaving the room.

269
00:16:54,630 --> 00:17:00,730
Mr. Mouri heard the swashy sound when the boards got into the water.

270
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:01,930
That's right.

271
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:06,730
Using this trick, Eri tried to disguise the order of the murder,

272
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,830
in order to establish her alibi.

273
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:13,030
But the question is, where did the boards go?

274
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,330
Right.

275
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,730
Here it is, Mr. Mouri.

276
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,230
What is that?

277
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,530
These were the sashes left in the closet.

278
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,830
They are frozen hard though.

279
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:30,330
A sash becomes like this if you soak and leave it outside for a night.

280
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:34,330
She used the frozen sash to hide her footprints in the snow.

281
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,730
I see. When they are put in the water...

282
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,730
they just turn into normal sashes.

283
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,430
It would look odd if there were just a dead body

284
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,630
and a couple of sashes in the water.

285
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,430
Thus, she put some more sashes into the water

286
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,930
and spread tons of kimono in the shrine.

287
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,730
That way, the murder scene looks more like the folklore of Kimono Demon,

288
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:59,130
which actually hides the secret of the trick.

289
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,830
That's a very clever deduction.

290
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,130
But where is the evidence?

291
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,430
Show me the sole of your foot.

292
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,630
Show me, would you?

293
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,430
Please, Eri.

294
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:21,930
All right.

295
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,630
I think I stepped on a nail or something.

296
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,930
I don't think so.

297
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,230
You actually stepped on Ema's earring

298
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,430
which actually dropped in the middle of the fight.

299
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,430
Last night, I told you guys to wait in the hall

300
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,330
while we did some on-site investigation.

301
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,930
However, Eri said it was better to sit on a chair rather than on the floor,

302
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,230
so you guys moved to the lobby.

303
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:55,730
Eri, that's because your foot was bleeding, wasn't it?

304
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:00,330
That's why you wouldn't want to take off your slippers in the hall.

305
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:03,230
Do you have evidence that this a wound I got from the earring?

306
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,830
I found the missing earring.

307
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,030
Here!

308
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,130
Conan!

309
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:14,030
This brand name earring is worth 200,000 yen a piece.

310
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:18,830
Nice! If her blood is on it, it will serve as evidence!

311
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,930
It's amazing that you found it.

312
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:26,330
Actually, this is a pendant. I borrowed from Harumi.

313
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,430
Okay. I give up.

314
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,630
I killed Asuka and Ema.

315
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:54,130
Why did you do such a horrible thing, Eri?

316
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:57,830
Her name is not Eri. It's actually Chieri.

317
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,830
She's been hiding her real name.

318
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,430
Your last name, "Ake" is a very rare name.

319
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:07,930
So people think your real name is Akechi Eri, rather than Ake Chieri.

320
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:11,130
I asked my friend at the Metropolitan Police to do some research on you.

321
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:15,030
Chieri, you are the real sister of Sakurako Suzuka,

322
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,030
who killed herself five years ago, right?

323
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:21,730
What? Eri and Sakurako are sisters?

324
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:25,630
As you sisters lost your parents in a fire,

325
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:30,130
Sakurako was adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Suzuka.

326
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,630
Okay, I'll tell you the rest.

327
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,730
When my younger sister Sakurako died,

328
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,330
I was in Boston, trying to become a famous writer.

329
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:43,530
So it was actually a year later when I heard that she killed herself.

330
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,330
She was a very naive girl.

331
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,530
And because somebody framed her up selling drugs,

332
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,630
she had to kill herself.

333
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,130
Poor Sakurako.

334
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:56,630
How come she didn't tell me about it?

335
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,230
I'm her sister.

336
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,630
I'm the only family for her in this world.

337
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:07,830
What Asuka and Ema did to my sister was totally unforgivable.

338
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:11,130
So one day, I came up with the idea of revenge.

339
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,830
I asked my university friend Yoriko

340
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:18,330
to invite Asuka and Ema to this hotel for coverage of a new TV series.

341
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,030
It was a perfect opportunity to take revenge

342
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,430
disguised by the folklore of the Kimono Demon.

343
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:27,130
Okay. But do you think Sakurako is happy about it?

344
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,830
There was a person among the three interviewees

345
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:36,230
that your sister actually trusted from the bottom of her heart.

346
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,930
It was Harumi Fukatsu. If she wasn't here,

347
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,630
I wouldn't have known about your sister's death.

348
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:46,630
And therefore, would not have suspected you as the murderer.

349
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:52,030
To me, it just feels like it was Sakurako's will that you two met.

350
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,230
By meeting Harumi, it's most likely
