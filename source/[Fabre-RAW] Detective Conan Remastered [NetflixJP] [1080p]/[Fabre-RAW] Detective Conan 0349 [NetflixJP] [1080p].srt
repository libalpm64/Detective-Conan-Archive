1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,220
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,320
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,720
Mystery that's out of season.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,620
Everybody's feelings help solve a case.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,120
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,020
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,020
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,080
Dear, please hang in there.

9
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,880
Don't let go, please.

10
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,980
Take it easy, Mrs. Nagakura.

11
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,080
Wait a minute!

12
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,180
This is not a mark left by hitting or scraping...

13
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,280
What is it?

14
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,980
Don't get in the way, young man.

15
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,380
Excuse me.

16
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,180
He's unconscious and seriously injured.

17
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,780
Questioning at the hospital would be difficult.

18
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,180
Well, I didn't notice anything.

19
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,180
I drank too much and was fast asleep.

20
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,780
Excuse me,

21
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,880
"Shokichi Sakaki (52)" -but Mr. Mouri can solve cases in his sleep.

22
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,980
Well...

23
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,180
Mouri?

24
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,680
You're the the Sleeping Kogoro,

25
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,280
Mr. Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?

26
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,980
The detective.

27
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,680
The famous detective, yes.

28
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,280
Sorry, Mr. Mouri.

29
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,480
The higher-ups gave me their consent.

30
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,580
So please help investigate this case with us.

31
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,680
From your higher-ups...

32
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,980
Well...

33
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:29,080
"Love, Ghosts and World Heritage (Part 2)"

34
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,280
We are expecting this village

35
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,080
to be registered as the World Heritage soon,

36
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,480
and we do not want any incident like this happening here.

37
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,280
As a matter of fact, I'm from this village,

38
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,180
and I hope the case closes as early as possible.

39
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,280
So please help us on this matter, Mr. Mouri!

40
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,380
I see.

41
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,680
If you insist,

42
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,780
I, Kogoro Mouri,

43
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,380
will give my best in this case.

44
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,580
Thank you very much, sir.

45
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,480
So rest assured and don't worry.

46
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,080
Well then, excuse me for rushing you,

47
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,180
but who is the culprit?

48
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,680
What?

49
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,680
It can't possibly be a ghost.

50
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,080
What are you talking about?

51
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,480
Of course not.

52
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,980
Oh, I'm speaking to the other party.

53
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,880
Then that means the culprit is...

54
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,580
Yes, of course.

55
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,780
It's him.

56
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,480
But you saw Mami too, right?

57
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,780
No. Something made you think you did.

58
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,680
You mean like the laundry?

59
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,480
But because Ayumi saw something,

60
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,380
it helped to find out which way the culprit fled.

61
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,780
This way leads to a dead end.

62
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,180
He leaves the village.

63
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,180
That means...

64
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,680
The culprit is yet to leave the village!

65
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,880
And at this time of the day,

66
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,580
he wouldn't choose to come from outside this village.

67
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,580
That means the culprit is

68
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,480
one of the people in Onizawa village,

69
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,680
including the tourists.

70
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,980
Who are you kids to...

71
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,280
Don't bother yourself over them.

72
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,880
Any layman can think up what they just said.

73
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,980
That's right.

74
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,980
Stay out of it, all of you.

75
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,980
Furthermore, there's something more important

76
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,880
that you should note.

77
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,580
And what's that?

78
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,780
The culprit hid the rope there in the daytime,

79
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,380
during the sightseeing tour,

80
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,680
and used that rope at night to break into the house.

81
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,880
Then it means that...

82
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,380
the culprit is somebody who is not from Mr. Nagakura house,

83
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,880
where the Mouri party stayed at,

84
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,380
but is definitely among one of the guests.

85
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,480
Just as expected, Mr. Mouri!

86
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,280
I'm so impressed!

87
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,580
It's nothing.

88
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,380
It's just one of the things I do!

89
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,080
That is that.

90
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,680
But the question is

91
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,380
what was the culprit doing there?

92
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,880
That's more important.

93
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,080
Don't push me, Genta.

94
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,580
Hurry up...

95
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,680
One more floor to climb.

96
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,480
Maybe he was just a thief after all?

97
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,580
But what was he trying to steal?

98
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,380
Then, did I imagine what I saw after all?

99
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,680
If Conan says so, he could be right.

100
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,980
But...

101
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,680
He was not exactly stealing something.

102
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,480
But I'm sure he was looking for something.

103
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,680
What was that thing he was looking for?

104
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,380
-What's wrong? -Nothing.

105
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,780
I just thought from here,

106
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,380
you can get a good view of the scene

107
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,780
where Mr. Nagakura was stabbed.

108
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,280
If you can get a good view from here,

109
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,080
it means this place is in clear view from there too.

110
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,580
Of course! That explains it!

111
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,480
What did you say?

112
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,980
Conan, did something happen?

113
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,680
Hey, kid!

114
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,480
Just as I thought. It's true.

115
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,380
What's wrong with this?

116
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,480
Keep off! You'll get a rash if you touch it.

117
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,780
A lacquer tree, isn't it?

118
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,380
I remember that the hand of Mr. Nagakura got...

119
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,480
Yeah. It means Mr. Nagakura passed by here yesterday.

120
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,580
Murderer!

121
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,280
You lied. Liar.

122
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,080
What is this all about?

123
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,180
He is the one

124
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,880
that was rude to everyone the day before yesterday.

125
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,580
Could it be that he did it to Mr. Nagakura?

126
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:56,280
But then, why are those villagers at each other?

127
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,380
I can explain that.

128
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,680
Why?

129
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,480
I read an article in a magazine on the way here.

130
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,080
When applying for the World Heritage,

131
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,980
the villagers were separated into two opposing groups.

132
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,480
One group opposed saying that there would be no need for more tourism.

133
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,380
The other wanted to promote the existence of this village to the world.

134
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,580
If I remember correctly,

135
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,180
Mr. Nagakura represented the group that promoted the application.

136
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,780
Is that so?

137
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,180
That's why Mr. Nagakura was trying to say...

138
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,380
All of you...

139
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,780
-Who's behind all this? -Dear!

140
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,480
I got it. They are behind all this!

141
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,980
When he said "them",

142
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,480
he meant the opposing group.

143
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,580
Calm down, people.

144
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,080
Let the police take over and please go home.

145
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,880
-We can't. -Let's decide now.

146
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,980
-That's right. -Hey, he is getting away.

147
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,480
-Don't let him get away. Get him. -Stop it, everyone.

148
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,780
"Onizawa Village Office"

149
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,380
An investigator?

150
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,380
Yes. He said he was sent from the committee

151
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,580
that is involved in accepting applications for World Heritage.

152
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,280
I heard before that

153
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,980
there is a special undercover investigator,

154
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,880
who makes a fair evaluation.

155
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,980
That's right.

156
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,080
But in his case, he is the official investigator.

157
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,480
You took bribes from those municipalities

158
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,380
as resources for promotion.

159
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,380
Am I right, Mr. Kawaji?

160
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,880
I don't know what you're talking about.

161
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,480
"Kensaku Kawaji (37)" -Cut it out.

162
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,980
Suits for damage have been filed already.

163
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,380
And we've got the goods on you.

164
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,980
You asked Mr. Nagakura for commission, but was turned down,

165
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,080
so you got mad at him, lost yourself

166
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,980
and did it, didn't you?

167
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,980
Stop talking nonsense!

168
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,180
Sure, I talked about money,

169
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,480
and it's true that I was turned down.

170
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,180
That's why I gave up and went to bed early

171
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,580
because I decided to leave here today.

172
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,880
I stayed inside the house.

173
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,480
You are an old dog at this business,

174
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,280
and you gave up just like that?

175
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,880
Do you expect me to believe you?

176
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,380
I'm an old dog at this business, that's why I gave up!

177
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,080
My experience told me the sooner I quit the better.

178
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,680
I know when I can't expect money!

179
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,180
Look at this!

180
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,780
This is...

181
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,380
It's Mr. Nagakura's watchman's record book.

182
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,680
The record says for the night

183
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,880
"All is well" up to the ninth house.

184
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,380
Mr. Nagakura was found

185
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,780
on the way to the ninth house.

186
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,280
It's very close to the Ishioka house

187
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,480
where you spent the night.

188
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,980
I don't know anything.

189
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,380
I didn't choose to stay in that house.

190
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,080
Is there anyone who saw you asleep?

191
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,580
I was alone in the room, so no one did.

192
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,980
But it's not me!

193
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,680
I didn't do a foolish thing like stab a man.

194
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,980
"Onizawa Village Office" -After that,

195
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,280
Kensaku Kawaji was taken to the police as a material witness

196
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,880
for extortion and attempted murder.

197
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,180
But he totally denied attempted murder.

198
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,580
He also denied charges for unlawful entry

199
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,880
into the Mr. Nagakura house.

200
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,080
So, the case seemed to be closed.

201
00:11:08,023 --> 00:11:10,223
Thank you very much for everything.

202
00:11:10,223 --> 00:11:13,723
Thanks to you, we were able to get Mr. Kawaji.

203
00:11:15,123 --> 00:11:18,723
How about drinking to the success of getting him?

204
00:11:18,723 --> 00:11:19,923
Gosh.

205
00:11:19,923 --> 00:11:23,023
I would like to say sure.

206
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:25,923
But we have to start questioning him.

207
00:11:25,923 --> 00:11:27,623
Of course...

208
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:33,523
The Nagakuras went through a series of misfortunes, so far.

209
00:11:33,523 --> 00:11:34,923
It's good that the case is closed,

210
00:11:34,923 --> 00:11:37,623
rather, I'm glad that the case is closed.

211
00:11:37,623 --> 00:11:40,223
A series of misfortunes?

212
00:11:40,223 --> 00:11:44,323
You're talking about his son, Eiji Nagakura, right?

213
00:11:44,323 --> 00:11:46,023
What a terrible thing to happen...

214
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:47,423
"Jewel Thief Commits Suicide"

215
00:11:47,423 --> 00:11:48,923
"Robbery-murder Case in Shoujin"

216
00:11:48,923 --> 00:11:51,423
"Death of Suspect, Half Year Case Closed" -I'm sure it's her.

217
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:55,823
Mami believes that Eiji is not guilty and comes to see him.

218
00:11:55,823 --> 00:11:57,523
And Eiji.

219
00:11:57,523 --> 00:11:59,523
That fellow is not my son!

220
00:11:59,523 --> 00:12:01,623
Keep that in mind!

221
00:12:01,623 --> 00:12:03,223
Well, anyway...

222
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,223
After all of these things, ten days ago,

223
00:12:05,223 --> 00:12:10,823
they renovated the rooftop after 30 years,

224
00:12:10,823 --> 00:12:15,623
and they moved the whole house to the present site.

225
00:12:15,623 --> 00:12:17,623
What? Moved the whole house?

226
00:12:17,623 --> 00:12:19,323
What is it?

227
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:21,723
They moved that big house?

228
00:12:21,723 --> 00:12:22,823
Is that so?

229
00:12:22,823 --> 00:12:26,123
That explains why the foundation looked so new.

230
00:12:27,723 --> 00:12:30,723
It sure surprised me but that's not all.

231
00:12:32,423 --> 00:12:33,923
What?

232
00:12:33,923 --> 00:12:37,623
Mr. Nagakura's house was here until a half month ago?

233
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,023
Yes.

234
00:12:39,023 --> 00:12:42,423
The house was moved from here to where it is now.

235
00:12:42,423 --> 00:12:45,223
This Otozawa house had been over there

236
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,923
and they exchanged the houses all together.

237
00:12:46,923 --> 00:12:49,223
Why did they do that?

238
00:12:49,223 --> 00:12:51,823
They said they did it for complete reversal or something.

239
00:12:51,823 --> 00:12:53,123
It's probably because

240
00:12:53,123 --> 00:12:57,123
the place over there commands the best view in the whole village.

241
00:12:57,123 --> 00:12:59,423
As a representative of promotion for World Heritage application,

242
00:12:59,423 --> 00:13:02,023
he managed to do it.

243
00:13:02,023 --> 00:13:04,723
At least some people say so.

244
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:06,923
Well, anyway, they really look alike.

245
00:13:06,923 --> 00:13:09,323
Yes. It sure is identical.

246
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:12,223
You mean to Mr. Nagakura's house?

247
00:13:12,223 --> 00:13:15,423
At night, you could easily mistake one for the other.

248
00:13:15,423 --> 00:13:17,623
If the motive of the culprit had nothing to do

249
00:13:17,623 --> 00:13:22,023
with the application for the World Heritage...

250
00:13:23,123 --> 00:13:26,523
In other word, if the culprit simply made a mistake

251
00:13:26,523 --> 00:13:28,523
and took one house for another...

252
00:13:29,723 --> 00:13:32,123
-Hey, Conan! -Did anything happen?

253
00:13:35,723 --> 00:13:37,123
Conan!

254
00:13:37,123 --> 00:13:40,023
Stop running.

255
00:13:40,023 --> 00:13:41,623
Just as I thought.

256
00:13:41,623 --> 00:13:43,523
They are identical inside, too.

257
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,623
When he was in Mr. Nagakura house,

258
00:13:45,623 --> 00:13:47,023
he was somewhere around here looking for...

259
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,123
I've found it.

260
00:13:55,423 --> 00:13:57,223
What did you find?

261
00:13:59,123 --> 00:14:01,623
-Great! -Terrific sight to see!

262
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:05,023
Beautiful, very beautiful..

263
00:14:05,023 --> 00:14:06,023
Are these...

264
00:14:06,023 --> 00:14:08,623
Yeah. Most likely...

265
00:14:08,623 --> 00:14:10,323
Hello?

266
00:14:10,323 --> 00:14:12,323
Oh, it's you, Shinichi.

267
00:14:12,323 --> 00:14:13,523
What's that?

268
00:14:13,523 --> 00:14:17,123
The jewelry stolen in the robbery case...

269
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,223
Where are they now?

270
00:14:19,223 --> 00:14:21,423
They are still missing.

271
00:14:21,423 --> 00:14:25,823
Police concluded that they had been disposed of a long time ago.

272
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,023
Speaking of missing...

273
00:14:30,023 --> 00:14:32,523
When he made his escape from the shop,

274
00:14:32,523 --> 00:14:35,023
he took a jeweler hostage

275
00:14:35,023 --> 00:14:37,323
and the hostage is still missing.

276
00:14:37,323 --> 00:14:39,223
They say that the hostage was killed

277
00:14:39,223 --> 00:14:41,423
when he was no longer of any use, but...

278
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:42,423
It's hot!

279
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,023
It's not... It was...

280
00:14:44,023 --> 00:14:46,823
It's nothing. Nothing to do with you at all.

281
00:14:56,023 --> 00:14:58,423
Are you all right, Conan?

282
00:14:58,423 --> 00:14:59,823
That thing, you know?

283
00:14:59,823 --> 00:15:03,023
We'd better give them to the police.

284
00:15:03,023 --> 00:15:04,623
Keep your voice down.

285
00:15:04,623 --> 00:15:08,123
Well, thanks, ladies.

286
00:15:08,123 --> 00:15:10,323
Come. Here you go.

287
00:15:15,523 --> 00:15:18,023
As I expected. The real culprit is that person.

288
00:15:18,023 --> 00:15:20,523
The person who will show up at that place tonight.

289
00:15:21,323 --> 00:15:23,723
"Otozawa"

290
00:15:26,123 --> 00:15:27,423
I've found it.

291
00:15:32,623 --> 00:15:35,723
We've been expecting you, mister.

292
00:15:38,223 --> 00:15:39,623
We've been waiting for you.

293
00:15:39,623 --> 00:15:41,623
And you can't run away this time.

294
00:15:41,623 --> 00:15:43,523
What're you talking about?

295
00:15:43,523 --> 00:15:46,823
I just couldn't sleep and took a walk

296
00:15:46,823 --> 00:15:50,423
but got lost because the house was so much alike...

297
00:15:50,423 --> 00:15:53,223
Then, what's with that jewelry you have?

298
00:15:53,223 --> 00:15:56,423
You broke into the jeweler's shop in the neighboring town

299
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:57,923
and took them, didn't you?

300
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,623
I don't know what you're talking about.

301
00:15:59,623 --> 00:16:01,623
You can't fool us.

302
00:16:01,623 --> 00:16:04,823
You are the principal culprit of the jewelry robbery

303
00:16:04,823 --> 00:16:06,223
who killed Mr. Eiji Nagakura

304
00:16:06,223 --> 00:16:08,723
and made it look like suicide. Am I right?

305
00:16:09,923 --> 00:16:11,423
Mr. Eiji...

306
00:16:11,423 --> 00:16:13,923
seems to have been in debt.

307
00:16:13,923 --> 00:16:17,223
That's why he was made to watch out for the robbery.

308
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:20,223
So it was you alone who carried out the jewelry robbery

309
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,923
and murdered the watchman.

310
00:16:22,923 --> 00:16:24,323
I know nothing.

311
00:16:24,323 --> 00:16:26,623
What you're talking about is beyond...

312
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,523
When fleeing,

313
00:16:28,523 --> 00:16:29,823
you visited this Onizawa village

314
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,823
as guided by Mr. Eiji.

315
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:32,923
You hid the jewelry you robbed

316
00:16:32,923 --> 00:16:36,623
in the Otozawa house which was vacant at that time.

317
00:16:36,623 --> 00:16:38,423
You never dreamed that the house itself

318
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:43,023
would be moved in half a month.

319
00:16:43,023 --> 00:16:46,623
Then, you pinned the guilt on Mr. Eiji alone,

320
00:16:46,623 --> 00:16:48,623
and killed him making it look like he committed suicide

321
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:52,923
Then you came here as a tourist

322
00:16:52,923 --> 00:16:55,423
to retrieve the jewelry you hid.

323
00:16:55,423 --> 00:16:59,123
That's the jewelry in your left hand, isn't it?

324
00:17:01,823 --> 00:17:03,123
That night,

325
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:05,823
you assumed Mr. Nagakura was away,

326
00:17:05,823 --> 00:17:08,923
you were looking for the jewelry but were discovered

327
00:17:08,923 --> 00:17:10,923
so you got out through the window.

328
00:17:10,923 --> 00:17:13,023
That means that you didn't break into the house

329
00:17:13,023 --> 00:17:15,623
but were inside from the beginning.

330
00:17:15,623 --> 00:17:20,023
Unfortunately, Mr. Nagakura saw you when he was on watch.

331
00:17:20,023 --> 00:17:24,223
When he hurriedly rushed back to his house...

332
00:17:31,023 --> 00:17:33,823
The watch record shows that something went wrong

333
00:17:33,823 --> 00:17:35,023
with the order in which the seals were stamped.

334
00:17:35,023 --> 00:17:39,823
I'm just an old man and a tourist.

335
00:17:39,823 --> 00:17:42,423
I just found this by accident.

336
00:17:42,423 --> 00:17:47,023
I knew that you're not just an old man and a tourist

337
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:50,023
when I noticed the mark around your right eye.

338
00:17:51,523 --> 00:17:54,223
That mark is the trace of a loupe

339
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:59,423
The jeweler who was taken as hostage, murdered, and missing

340
00:17:59,423 --> 00:18:02,723
is none other than you, Mr. Sakaki.

341
00:18:04,323 --> 00:18:05,923
Surely...

342
00:18:05,923 --> 00:18:07,923
But after the culprit commits suicide,

343
00:18:07,923 --> 00:18:10,823
I was scared and hiding myself

344
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:14,123
and now I conjured up enough courage to come out

345
00:18:14,123 --> 00:18:16,423
to retrieve the jewelry and return it.

346
00:18:16,423 --> 00:18:20,423
What if I were to say that, kids?

347
00:18:20,423 --> 00:18:22,123
So, you admit that

348
00:18:22,123 --> 00:18:25,023
you were looking for the jewelry on the third floor

349
00:18:25,023 --> 00:18:26,323
of Mr. Nagakura's house last night.

350
00:18:26,323 --> 00:18:30,223
Well, I wouldn't be so sure.

351
00:18:30,223 --> 00:18:32,723
When you went out through the window

352
00:18:32,723 --> 00:18:35,223
and injured Mr. Nagakura, is that right?

353
00:18:35,223 --> 00:18:36,323
Oh, that!

354
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,423
I was drunk with sake and sound asleep.

355
00:18:39,423 --> 00:18:41,923
So I couldn't possibly have done it.

356
00:18:41,923 --> 00:18:45,023
Then, when and where did you get the rash?

357
00:18:48,523 --> 00:18:50,623
When you both were drinking sake together,

358
00:18:50,623 --> 00:18:54,223
both of you had no rash or reddening on you.

359
00:18:54,223 --> 00:18:56,523
The people who were with you at dinner

360
00:18:56,523 --> 00:18:58,323
can easily prove it.

361
00:18:58,323 --> 00:19:01,223
But the red rash on both of you is evidence

362
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,223
that you were at the same place at the same time.

363
00:19:08,423 --> 00:19:09,823
Mr. Nagakura!

364
00:19:09,823 --> 00:19:11,523
Call an ambulance!

365
00:19:11,523 --> 00:19:13,723
That is the only place in the village that has lacquer trees.

366
00:19:13,723 --> 00:19:15,423
There is no other place.

367
00:19:15,423 --> 00:19:16,623
That settles it.

368
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:20,523
You! Who are you to press on me?

369
00:19:20,523 --> 00:19:23,723
Conan Edogawa, a detective.

370
00:19:23,723 --> 00:19:26,523
-We're the Youth Detective Squad! -We're the Youth Detective Squad!

371
00:19:26,523 --> 00:19:28,723
You are talking rubbish! Get off!

372
00:19:28,723 --> 00:19:31,423
I'm not going to get caught for all the effort I made.

373
00:19:35,123 --> 00:19:36,523
Give me back...

374
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:40,623
Give me back my Eiji...

375
00:19:40,623 --> 00:19:41,823
Give him back!

376
00:19:41,823 --> 00:19:43,823
Keep off, you... Get off of me.

377
00:19:43,823 --> 00:19:45,423
Okay! Now!

378
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,523
Get this!

379
00:19:59,223 --> 00:20:00,423
It hurts...

380
00:20:20,323 --> 00:20:22,323
You've done well, Ayumi!

381
00:20:22,323 --> 00:20:25,023
That's what real acting is, Ayumi.

382
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,123
You are worthy of an Academy Award!

383
00:20:27,123 --> 00:20:28,723
What?

384
00:20:28,723 --> 00:20:30,023
Act?

385
00:20:30,023 --> 00:20:33,123
I was just standing there all the time.

386
00:20:33,123 --> 00:20:36,123
But, then what was that...

387
00:20:36,123 --> 00:20:38,223
Look at that!

388
00:20:43,323 --> 00:20:44,723
Mist, it's the mist.

389
00:20:44,723 --> 00:20:45,723
Look closely.

390
00:20:45,723 --> 00:20:47,823
-What? Mist? -Mist?

391
00:20:49,823 --> 00:20:51,723
The Brocken spectre

392
00:20:51,723 --> 00:20:54,123
The one you look from time to time

393
00:20:54,123 --> 00:20:55,823
out of an airplane or mountain top.

394
00:20:55,823 --> 00:20:59,523
I see. That's what it was!

395
00:21:02,923 --> 00:21:04,023
Yes.

396
00:21:04,023 --> 00:21:07,123
There is nothing in this world

397
00:21:07,123 --> 00:21:08,623
that you cannot solve by logic and reasoning.

398
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,723
Mr. Mouri!

399
00:22:46,923 --> 00:22:49,323
Thanks for the call yesterday.

400
00:22:49,323 --> 00:22:50,923
What? Call?

401
00:22:50,923 --> 00:22:54,023
Thanks to you, we got to check him before he tried to escape.

402
00:22:54,023 --> 00:22:56,223
As expected of you, Mr. Mouri.

403
00:22:56,223 --> 00:22:59,923
I, Tamekichi Matsushiro, really respect you, sir.

404
00:22:59,923 --> 00:23:01,423
Respect!

405
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:03,623
That's right.

406
00:23:03,623 --> 00:23:07,223
Sure thing...

407
00:23:12,923 --> 00:23:15,123
I wish I could see you even if just for an instant.

408
00:23:15,123 --> 00:23:18,023
I don't mind if you're a ghost, Mami.

409
00:23:20,623 --> 00:23:22,923
Hurry up, Ayumi.

410
00:23:22,923 --> 00:23:24,523
We're going.

411
00:23:24,523 --> 00:23:27,023
I'm coming up.

412
00:23:27,023 --> 00:23:28,723
Wait for me!

413
00:23:30,023 --> 00:23:32,623
And the two houses that have been moved were returned

414
00:23:32,623 --> 00:23:35,023
and placed back to where they originally were.

415
00:23:35,023 --> 00:23:38,523
After recovered from his injury,

416
00:23:38,523 --> 00:23:40,323
Mr. Nagakura thought that the spirit of the girl,

417
00:23:40,323 --> 00:23:43,423
who had been a close friend of his deceased son,

418
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:47,023
had revealed the truth about the death of his son.

419
00:23:47,023 --> 00:23:48,223
Of course.

420
00:23:48,223 --> 00:23:52,023
I, the detective of logic and reasoning, didn't believe it.

421
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,823
Two months later,

422
00:23:54,823 --> 00:23:59,123
Onizawa village was officially registered as a World Heritage.

423
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,350
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,050
"Telephone number"

425
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,050
Question!

426
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,750
What is the name of the coffee shop below the Mouri Detective Agency?

427
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,050
Are you the young lady who just poured beer?
