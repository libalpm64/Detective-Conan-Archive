1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,310
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,010
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,810
In today's episode, the mysterious key is the key.

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,910
A surprise behind locked doors.

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,410
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,410
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,010
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,970
I'm sure it was around here.

9
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,170
Did you say Hikari Souda?

10
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,970
Yeah, it's a rundown old apartment building

11
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,270
that looks like it'll fall any minute.

12
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,670
Hey.

13
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,970
I think, this might be it.

14
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,670
Maison Hikari.

15
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,970
I don't believe it.

16
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:07,870
"Case Of The Key Underwater In A Locked Room"

17
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,370
"Mitsue Souda (73) Landlord" -Oh, I'm so sorry,

18
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,970
I had this place rebuilt this Spring into a condominium.

19
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,370
Gee... I didn't know that, what a shock.

20
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,770
It's a lot different from the apartment you stayed in

21
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,470
when you were a student, isn't it?

22
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,770
It sure is, like night and day.

23
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,370
As a matter of fact, you left here after only 6 months

24
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,770
to get away from your nagging landlord, didn't you?

25
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,170
I... I don't remember.

26
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,070
Hey, Ma'am, do you live here all alone?

27
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:45,070
That's right, my children have moved away.

28
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,670
But my grandson lives on this floor.

29
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,970
Here you go, eat up...

30
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,170
Wow, looks delicious.

31
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,670
You're not so lonely then.

32
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,970
No, I'm not, since Makoto is staying here with me.

33
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,470
He is studying construction at Jyonan University

34
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,770
but lately, he's been so depressed.

35
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,870
I asked why but he won't tell me.

36
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,170
So I thought a famous private detective like you

37
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,170
would be able to get him to talk.

38
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,670
Is that why you called me?

39
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:21,370
He said he'd drop by around 8pm.

40
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,270
Go check on him.

41
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,870
Only he and I live on the 4th floor.

42
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,870
I'm only renting out the rooms on the 1st to 3rd floors.

43
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,970
"Makoto Souda"

44
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,870
That's odd.

45
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,770
He might be sleeping.

46
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,670
I will open the door with my key.

47
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,070
Do you think we should go in without his permission?

48
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,570
It's all right, he's my grandson.

49
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,570
Makoto, are you in?

50
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,970
Good grief, what a mess.

51
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,570
What is this?

52
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,170
Excuse me.

53
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,770
Sir.

54
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,270
Is that what I think it is?

55
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,570
No, it's just crayon.

56
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,470
Oh, no.

57
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,570
Even over here.

58
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,670
Monument in the water?

59
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,470
What in the world is this?

60
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,770
-How awful. -Makoto?

61
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,070
There's a key in the water.

62
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,270
Makoto?

63
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,970
Makoto!

64
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,870
Makoto?

65
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,370
Makoto?

66
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,270
Makoto!

67
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,770
What's wrong?

68
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,270
Makoto? Wake up!

69
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,070
Makoto?

70
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,070
Makoto!

71
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,670
On the inside of his left wrist...

72
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,770
No hesitation cuts.

73
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,570
Hurry, call an ambulance.

74
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,770
-No. It's too late. -That's ridiculous!

75
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,170
Oh, I know, call Kido!

76
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,170
Kido?

77
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,570
He's a medical student, he lives on the 3rd floor.

78
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:50,870
He and Makoto are friends!

79
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,170
But your grandson is already...

80
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,670
Never mind, just get him!

81
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,070
I'll go get him!

82
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,870
"Yoshihiko Kido"

83
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,870
Mr. Kido!

84
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,970
Mr. Kido!

85
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,570
Mr. Kido?

86
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,670
Mr. Kido.

87
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,270
How smelly.

88
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,870
Oh, he's only in a drunken sleep.

89
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,870
Just look at this place.

90
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,270
Who're you?

91
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,370
Mr. Kido! Something's happened to Makoto!

92
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,570
Come quick!

93
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,870
Makoto!

94
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:11,070
The deceased is Makoto Souda, 22 years old.

95
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,770
He was a senior at Jyonan University,

96
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,170
majoring in construction in the engineering department.

97
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,970
Cause of death is assumed to be loss of blood

98
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,970
due to the severed artery of the upper arm.

99
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,220
Judging from rigor mortis of the neck region,

100
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,020
it looks like he's been dead for 2-3 hours.

101
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:32,820
Which puts the time of death between 6 and 7pm, is that correct?

102
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,920
Inspector, this is clearly a suicide.

103
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,820
A suicide?

104
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,720
Yes, please follow me.

105
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,920
-Look at this! -And what is this?

106
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,220
A model the deceased made.

107
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,520
Notice there's a key in the lake.

108
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,320
It's the key to this apartment,

109
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,920
it's a specially made key

110
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,820
so duplication is impossible.

111
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,220
And there are only 2 spares.

112
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,820
His grandmother has 1 and the other

113
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,120
is kept by the management company.

114
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,520
When you got here, the door was...

115
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,920
It was locked.

116
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,320
Which means the apartment was completely sealed off.

117
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,320
I see, so that's why you concluded it was suicide.

118
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,620
You're wrong!

119
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,520
He would never commit suicide!

120
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,220
When I brought him juice this evening,

121
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,720
he said he wanted to eat pumpkin for dinner.

122
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,120
What time was that?

123
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,420
Just about 5pm.

124
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,820
I went out right after that.

125
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,320
He was killed while I was gone.

126
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,020
What kind of juice was it?

127
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:43,420
It's my own blend to prevent summer heat fatigue.

128
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:47,620
It has some honey, garlic, banana in it.

129
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,620
And anyway, he showed no signs of wanting to kill himself,

130
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,420
besides, he had no reason.

131
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,420
Makoto was troubled.

132
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,020
In what way?

133
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,820
He said the design he was working on for his graduation project

134
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
wasn't coming along.

135
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,920
I knew it.

136
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,020
Maybe that's why he was so depressed.

137
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,020
And judging from the red crayon scratches on the wall

138
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,820
and the mess in the room,

139
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,320
he must have been in a very unstable state of mind.

140
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,720
Excuse me, Inspector.

141
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,520
What is this white thing attached to the key?

142
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,120
Huh?

143
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,620
You're right, what could it be?

144
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,520
Oh!

145
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,420
What are you doing, you fool?

146
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,020
I think this is toilet paper.

147
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,120
Toilet paper?

148
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,020
Yes. Tissue and other kinds of paper

149
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,620
won't disintegrate so easily when wet.

150
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,620
I'll bet someone cut the toilet paper really thin

151
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,120
then rolled it to make string

152
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,020
but why would they put it on a key?

153
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,920
Well, he could be rather strange at times.

154
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,120
It was probably just due to curiosity!

155
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,120
At any rate, this place was completely locked...

156
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,620
No, it wasn't.

157
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,820
What?

158
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,220
See, over there.

159
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,020
The ventilation ducts open.

160
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,220
You dummy,

161
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,320
do you think someone can get in and out

162
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,420
through that tiny space?

163
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,520
Take a look. The duct only about 15cm wide.

164
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,020
All the other keys are accounted for,

165
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,620
this was definitely a locked room...

166
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,820
But I still think it's strange to be a suicide.

167
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,020
It was pitch dark,

168
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,520
you couldn't cut the artery with such precision, could you?

169
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,120
Pitch dark?

170
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,620
There the lights off then you came in here?

171
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,920
Yes, but the bathroom...

172
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,320
The light in the bathroom was also off.

173
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,620
I turned it on and then went in.

174
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,220
It's still light outside at 5-6pm which is

175
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,820
the estimated time of death

176
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,720
but there're no windows in the bathroom.

177
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,220
Without the light on,

178
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,720
you wouldn't be able to see past your hands.

179
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,320
The killer may have inadvertently

180
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,720
turned the lights off when he was done.

181
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,220
If this was murder,

182
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,020
could the crayon markings on the wall

183
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,020
be to cover the crime?

184
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,120
The question is this key.

185
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,720
How was the killer able to leave the key here in the water.

186
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,620
There are 2 more mysteries.

187
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,620
Why did the killer mark not only the wall

188
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,120
but also the edge of the pillar

189
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,120
and the lock on the front door with crayon

190
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,220
and that ventilation duct,

191
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,720
it was open from the start,

192
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,020
I doubt the killer would have overlooked it.

193
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,520
Wait a minute,

194
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,820
that's not the only place that was open.

195
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,320
I've got it!

196
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,820
I've solved the case!

197
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,120
Forget what I said before, this is a murder!

198
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,120
Just follow me.

199
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,420
The key to solving this case is...

200
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,720
that mailbox.

201
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,120
First, the killer

202
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,020
threaded some string under the bridge,

203
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,920
pulls it to the front door,

204
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,520
passes it through the mailbox,

205
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,320
goes outside and locks the door.

206
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,620
And then, puts the key on one end of the string,

207
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,020
when the other thread is pulled,

208
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,520
the key moves toward the model.

209
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,720
And when it passes under the bridge, the paper string breaks

210
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,220
and the key falls into the water.

211
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,820
What do you think?

212
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,420
That solves the mystery of the locked room.

213
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,920
Yes, I see! Brilliant deduction, Mouri!

214
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,320
That's it! I've got it!

215
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,520
Sir, I don't understand.

216
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,520
This entrance and the living room

217
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,320
are at a right angle, isn't that right?

218
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,920
Huh? What about it?

219
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,920
If you pulled the thread from outside the door,

220
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,120
the thread would rub against the pillar at the earner

221
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,220
and leave a mark, wouldn't it?

222
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,020
It's not here.

223
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,120
I wanted them to see the killer deliberately

224
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,920
colored the edge of the pillar

225
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,520
and that this trick had nothing to do with thread.

226
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,120
Now for this.

227
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,420
That's it! Got it!

228
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:28,420
The killer locked the door through the mailbox rigging it.

229
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,220
The marks are... not here.

230
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,120
That's it! The ventilation duct!

231
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,620
The killer used the trick I explained

232
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,920
but with the ventilation duct...

233
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,520
Theoretically, it is possible.

234
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,020
No, it's impossible.

235
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,320
See, there's a dog in the house on the other side.

236
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,420
That is a wonderful watchdog,

237
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,920
he won't let anyone except his master get close.

238
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,320
Isn't that right, Kido?

239
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,520
Yes, it always barks at me too.

240
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,420
This place is in plain view of that yard.

241
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,220
If someone was doing something suspicious,

242
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,820
that dog would bark like crazy and everybody'd look outside.

243
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,920
I guess I missed on this one too.

244
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,820
It must've been suicide after all, Inspector.

245
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,720
No. It is murder!

246
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,120
And the killer...

247
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,620
The victim's wound shows no hesitation cut,

248
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,920
the gash is perfectly straight and deep.

249
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,620
The only ones capable of such precision

250
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,820
would be a doctor or a medical student.

251
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,520
But what trick did he use?

252
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,920
The buglight?

253
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,320
Wait a minute,

254
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,220
the sweater in the entrance.

255
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,220
The crayon markings all over the apartment.

256
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,620
And...

257
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,820
that's it!

258
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,120
That's why that duct was left open just so much,

259
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,220
making this place an almost sealed room.

260
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,710
Now to prove it...

261
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,110
There has to be something.

262
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,510
There has to be...

263
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,410
What's this?

264
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,110
That is this smell...

265
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,610
The smell's coming from here.

266
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,310
I wonder...

267
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,310
There it is!

268
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,910
Excuse me, Ma'am!

269
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:39,310
Is that the cup you brought the juice in?

270
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,610
Yes, it is.

271
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,310
How unusual, he washed it.

272
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,410
I knew it. Now I have the proof!

273
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,910
Thank you for all your co-operation.

274
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,410
That's all for today.

275
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,610
I got it!

276
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:57,910
I figured out the trick the killer used!

277
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,410
-What? -Are you sure, Conan?

278
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,810
Yes. I'll demonstrate.

279
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,510
Ma'am, may I borrow your key?

280
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,810
You dummy, how would you know?

281
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,210
Here, kid, you need the key, right?

282
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,010
-Take it. -Thank you.

283
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,810
Wait here for a while.

284
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,510
What in the world are you doing?

285
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,210
Never mind, just watch.

286
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,910
And now Ma'am, when I go out the door,

287
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,810
I want you to turn all the lights off.

288
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,510
All right.

289
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:42,910
Okay? I'm going to start, everyone watch quietly.

290
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,510
How cocky.

291
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,410
Something fell.

292
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,510
A beetle.

293
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,710
A male beetle.

294
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,110
What?

295
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,310
A buglight...

296
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,010
How did it go?

297
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,210
Conan.

298
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:28,110
I see, so this is how the killer did it.

299
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,610
But why did the beetle come here?

300
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,610
The smell.

301
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,010
It was lured here because the top of monument

302
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,710
was coated with the scent of something it liked.

303
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,110
And what about the sweater on the threshold?

304
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:46,010
The killer put it there so the beetle would be able to walk easily.

305
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:50,310
Beetles have a hard time walking on wood flooring and tile.

306
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:53,910
This hallway and the living room are carpeted.

307
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:58,310
The conditions were ideal for the killer.

308
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,510
Good work, Conan.

309
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,910
But where did you get the beetle you used?

310
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,310
Oh, I just took one of the ones

311
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,710
Mr. Kido is raising in his room.

312
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,910
I didn't ask permission, sorry, Mr. Kido, I let one get away!

313
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,710
Oh, forget it.

314
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,810
By the way, Mr. Kido,

315
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:19,010
were you here in this apartment tonight before I went to get you?

316
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,010
No, I didn't come here.

317
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,410
Really?

318
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,010
Are you sure?

319
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:28,310
Of course, I'm sure! Why're you asking that?

320
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,810
Then why does your handkerchief

321
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:34,210
smell like the juice Ma'am made?

322
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:42,810
Ma'am brought the juice to him at about 5 this evening.

323
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:46,410
Mr. Kido. After Makoto drank the juice,

324
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,210
you washed the cup, didn't you?

325
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,110
And the juice that dripped to the floor,

326
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:54,310
you wiped it up with your handkerchief, didn't you?

327
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,810
Why did he do it...

328
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,710
The reason is...

329
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,710
the male beetle might be lured by the juice

330
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,010
being its smell is stronger that the female beetle's scent,

331
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:07,710
so it might climb something other than the monument.

332
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,110
You coated the monument

333
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,810
with the female's scent, didn't you?

334
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:19,010
Kido, you didn't...

335
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,010
Let me see your handkerchief.

336
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,110
Boy, I goofed.

337
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:34,410
I was so relieved I shut him up,

338
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,310
I forgot to get rid of the handkerchief,

339
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,110
all because I got drunk celebrating and fell asleep.

340
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,610
Why did you do it?

341
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:46,210
About a year ago, he came to me with a proposition

342
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,810
and I stole some sleeping pills from the university's hospital.

343
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,710
We sold them.

344
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:55,710
But recently, he told me he wanted to quit.

345
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,010
He told me you were coming here tonight.

346
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:01,910
I was afraid he'd tell you about it and get arrested.

347
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,810
Why you...

348
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,810
I'm sure Makoto

349
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,210
regretted what he did

350
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:17,610
and was prepared to be punished.

351
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,610
This comes late, the crime's been committed

352
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:27,410
but a life is a burden heavier than you could ever imagine.

353
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:31,810
Delve on that burden while you're in prison!

354
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:36,410
You'll have a lot of time to think about it!

355
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,260
"Mouri Detective Agency"

356
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,260
I feel so sorry for Mrs. Mitsue.

357
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,560
Yes.

358
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,560
You can't replace her grandson,

359
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,360
but why don't the two of you visit her from time to time?

360
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,160
Okay.

361
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,160
By the way, Conan, you were so sharp tonight.

362
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,060
I was amazed.

363
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,960
That's because I always get to see the famous Mr. Mouri in action.

364
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,560
Like they say, learn by watching, without being taught!

365
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,160
You owe it all to me.

366
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:40,760
You're learning the trade without you even realizing it!

367
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,860
I wish you would learn a little more of trade.
