1
00:00:03,684 --> 00:00:05,084
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:05,084 --> 00:00:06,284
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:06,284 --> 00:00:08,284
And start the countdown to deduction and the future!

4
00:00:08,284 --> 00:00:09,784
The karaoke shop that everyone goes to.

5
00:00:09,784 --> 00:00:11,991
What is the truth that doesn't show on the video?

6
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:13,284
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,284 --> 00:00:14,984
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,984 --> 00:00:16,784
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:57,255 --> 00:01:58,955
Good morning!

10
00:02:21,855 --> 00:02:27,155
"Blind Spot of the Karaoke Shop (Part 1)"

11
00:02:31,355 --> 00:02:34,133
Look at this guy, talk about stupid!

12
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:35,755
What a laugh!

13
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:38,137
He's just like you, Genta!

14
00:02:42,355 --> 00:02:44,143
The shelf over on the other side.

15
00:02:44,143 --> 00:02:45,455
You're looking for a mystery book, right?

16
00:02:45,455 --> 00:02:47,155
Yeah, thanks.

17
00:02:54,153 --> 00:02:57,355
Here it is, here it is! Kaori Shinmei's new mystery stories.

18
00:02:57,355 --> 00:02:59,055
"Neck Experiment at Night".

19
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:02,161
There's only one more left. Lucky!

20
00:03:05,455 --> 00:03:07,355
Eisuke Hondo?

21
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:10,955
Hi, Conan, long time no see.

22
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:14,173
Oh, it's you, Conan!

23
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:16,655
Oh, the brats!

24
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,177
So, are you guys reading comic books without buying them

25
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:20,855
on your way home from school?

26
00:03:20,855 --> 00:03:22,555
Yeah, they are.

27
00:03:22,555 --> 00:03:26,855
Didn't you guys come to read comic books, too?

28
00:03:26,855 --> 00:03:28,855
Wrong,

29
00:03:28,855 --> 00:03:33,855
we came to buy reference books for the upcoming test!

30
00:03:33,855 --> 00:03:35,455
They rushed over here to buy reference books

31
00:03:35,455 --> 00:03:37,655
because the test date is drawing near.

32
00:03:37,655 --> 00:03:40,199
Like borrowed plumes I guess.

33
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:41,355
He hit the bull's eye.

34
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:44,203
He sure knows difficult phrases.

35
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:47,955
Eisuke, you've come back to school.

36
00:03:47,955 --> 00:03:51,055
I heard that you were absent for a long time.

37
00:03:51,055 --> 00:03:54,213
-Yes. -Right! He's starting school from today.

38
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:57,055
You were recuperating from an illness all this time, right?

39
00:03:57,055 --> 00:04:00,219
Right, right. To cure love sickness.

40
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:02,755
No, not love sickness, but just regular illness!

41
00:04:02,755 --> 00:04:05,155
Good grief.

42
00:04:05,155 --> 00:04:07,555
So he's the much rumoured about Eisuke Hondo?

43
00:04:07,555 --> 00:04:08,655
Yeah.

44
00:04:08,655 --> 00:04:12,231
He's a high school student who came in pursuit of Rena Mizunashi,

45
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:14,955
the announcer that resembles his older sister.

46
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,655
But, Rena Mizunashi turns out to be his real older sister,

47
00:04:17,655 --> 00:04:21,455
as well as a CIA agent who snuck into...

48
00:04:21,455 --> 00:04:25,255
Right. The Black Organization,

49
00:04:25,255 --> 00:04:28,255
the guys who shrunk my body.

50
00:04:28,255 --> 00:04:30,255
Since he found out about his older sister,

51
00:04:30,255 --> 00:04:33,055
it seems that the FBI is sheltering him.

52
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:35,855
But judging from the fact that he's walking around freely,

53
00:04:35,855 --> 00:04:38,855
he must've refused the witness protection program.

54
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:43,255
"Neck Experiment at Night 1" -This is volume one of the book!

55
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:52,555
I've got to have both volume 1 and volume 2, so I'll let you have this.

56
00:04:52,555 --> 00:04:56,275
But, volume 2 of this book will be coming out next month.

57
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:58,277
I can't wait that long.

58
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:01,255
I hate to be tied down by anything.

59
00:05:01,255 --> 00:05:03,055
And that includes time, too.

60
00:05:06,655 --> 00:05:10,955
Isn't this the reference book that the teacher recommended?

61
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,955
And, it's super cheap too!

62
00:05:13,955 --> 00:05:16,055
You should buy it too, Eisuke!

63
00:05:16,055 --> 00:05:18,955
Maybe problems in this book will come out in the next exam.

64
00:05:18,955 --> 00:05:21,055
You guys go ahead and buy it.

65
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:24,855
I don't think I'll be needing it.

66
00:05:24,855 --> 00:05:27,955
That's right. Eisuke, you've already got good grades.

67
00:05:27,955 --> 00:05:30,855
Smart aleck! I'm not going to show it to you,

68
00:05:30,855 --> 00:05:33,455
even if you come crying to me begging to see it!

69
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:41,355
See you, Conan, Ai!

70
00:05:41,355 --> 00:05:42,321
See you tomorrow!

71
00:05:42,555 --> 00:05:44,323
Don't forget to do your homework!

72
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:46,325
Same to you!

73
00:05:48,755 --> 00:05:51,055
50 meters behind you.

74
00:05:51,055 --> 00:05:54,755
Behind the vending machine in front of the convenience store.

75
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:57,855
We're being followed.

76
00:05:57,855 --> 00:06:01,855
Yeah, ever since we left the bookstore a while ago.

77
00:06:01,855 --> 00:06:03,855
I still don't know who they are,

78
00:06:03,855 --> 00:06:06,955
but I'm sure that they aren't from the Black Organization.

79
00:06:06,955 --> 00:06:08,955
Yes, I agree.

80
00:06:08,955 --> 00:06:12,351
They would never tail anyone so conspicuously.

81
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:16,355
If so, under these circumstances, they're most likely

82
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:19,955
FBI agents who're watching Eisuke Hondo.

83
00:06:20,955 --> 00:06:24,955
True. If they're watching him as well as guarding him,

84
00:06:24,955 --> 00:06:27,655
the distance they're maintaining is understandable.

85
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:30,369
Well, if we want to return to our normal lifestyle,

86
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:33,155
we've got to crush them quick,

87
00:06:33,155 --> 00:06:35,555
that crow organization.

88
00:06:38,055 --> 00:06:41,455
Oh, that's right! Since Eisuke's finally made it back to school,

89
00:06:41,455 --> 00:06:42,755
let's celebrate.

90
00:06:42,755 --> 00:06:45,355
Oh, great idea! Let's do it!

91
00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:47,955
No need to celebrate.

92
00:06:47,955 --> 00:06:52,391
Oh, what is it? You mean you can't accept our well wishes celebration?

93
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:54,955
-That's not it. -Well, wishes celebration.

94
00:06:54,955 --> 00:06:58,397
Then, shall we go to the cake shop that opened in front of the station?

95
00:06:58,555 --> 00:07:01,255
Oh, but I don't really care for sweets.

96
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,855
Okay, then let's go to the hamburger shop on 4-chome.

97
00:07:04,855 --> 00:07:05,955
Let's go.

98
00:07:05,955 --> 00:07:09,055
I hear that their spicy hot chicken is really good.

99
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,755
Oh, but I don't take too well with food that's too spicy hot either.

100
00:07:11,755 --> 00:07:14,855
You sure are finicky, aren't you?

101
00:07:14,855 --> 00:07:17,955
Then, there's only one place left to go.

102
00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:21,755
A place where we can all live it up together.

103
00:07:23,155 --> 00:07:27,155
"Tears of yesterday, summer breeze sways"

104
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:31,155
"Pulling the summer that has gone away"

105
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:33,855
"I'm dreaming a dream with no continuation"

106
00:07:33,855 --> 00:07:36,435
Karaoke?

107
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:39,755
I know that Haibara is not coming.

108
00:07:41,155 --> 00:07:43,755
"Karaoke"

109
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:47,455
You mean the high school students

110
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,855
who went in just now along with the child?

111
00:07:48,855 --> 00:07:53,455
Yeah, please inform me when they're ready to leave.

112
00:07:53,455 --> 00:07:58,455
When I came last time, I forgot something in that room.

113
00:07:58,455 --> 00:08:02,255
But, there haven't been any forgotten items recently.

114
00:08:02,255 --> 00:08:05,155
It seems that my friends hid it,

115
00:08:05,155 --> 00:08:07,655
so it can't be found that easily.

116
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:10,469
Well, I'll be waiting while singing in another room,

117
00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:12,471
so let me know. Okay?

118
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:16,475
"And, you will go off somewhere, too"

119
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:20,479
"You walk off and go on your way"

120
00:08:20,655 --> 00:08:24,483
"Dreaming a dream with no continuation"

121
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:30,489
"When you awaken, time goes by again"

122
00:08:32,855 --> 00:08:35,155
Conan, that was good!

123
00:08:35,155 --> 00:08:38,155
He's as tone-deaf as ever.

124
00:08:39,855 --> 00:08:41,555
Where's Eisuke?

125
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:44,255
He said he had to go to the men's room a while ago.

126
00:08:44,255 --> 00:08:46,505
Oh, talk about the devil.

127
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:49,855
Oh, boy. The next song is the one you entered...

128
00:08:51,355 --> 00:08:52,855
What?

129
00:08:52,855 --> 00:08:53,955
What is it?

130
00:08:53,955 --> 00:08:55,855
Isn't...

131
00:08:55,855 --> 00:08:58,055
Oh, I see. This is room number 3.

132
00:08:58,055 --> 00:08:59,355
I came to the wrong room.

133
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:01,755
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:07,155
It hurts.

135
00:09:08,155 --> 00:09:10,529
Are you all right?

136
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:13,155
I'm sorry! I was in a rush, you see.

137
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:15,355
Be careful.

138
00:09:17,755 --> 00:09:21,155
That klutz sure is taking his time.

139
00:09:23,555 --> 00:09:26,255
-Just for one? -Yes.

140
00:09:26,255 --> 00:09:29,055
Coming to karaoke alone after fishing.

141
00:09:29,055 --> 00:09:31,755
Unusual.

142
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:35,655
It's the second time he's gone to the restroom.

143
00:09:35,655 --> 00:09:38,355
What the hell is the star of the celebration doing anyway?

144
00:09:38,355 --> 00:09:40,355
Maybe he's not feeling all that well.

145
00:09:40,355 --> 00:09:42,255
After all he was sick up to now.

146
00:09:42,255 --> 00:09:44,055
I guess so.

147
00:09:45,255 --> 00:09:47,355
He's back!

148
00:09:52,855 --> 00:09:55,855
Are you all right? You look super pale.

149
00:09:55,855 --> 00:09:58,355
I'm just fine, yes.

150
00:09:58,355 --> 00:10:01,555
If you're not feeling well, shall we head home already?

151
00:10:01,555 --> 00:10:04,155
Yes, we'd better get out of here quick.

152
00:10:04,155 --> 00:10:06,585
No! Let's go home!

153
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:13,255
-Hello? -It's 5 minutes to ending time,

154
00:10:13,255 --> 00:10:17,055
-but would you like to extend? -What? Is it time already?

155
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:18,597
Oh, we're leaving.

156
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:19,755
All right.

157
00:10:19,755 --> 00:10:23,855
I mean you were looking at what time it was on your cell just a while ago.

158
00:10:23,855 --> 00:10:26,605
Conan, make sure not forget anything.

159
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:27,455
Okay.

160
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,955
Well, the only thing I have on me is my school bag.

161
00:10:34,255 --> 00:10:36,255
What happened?

162
00:10:36,255 --> 00:10:38,055
My goodness.

163
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,655
Is this for real?

164
00:10:50,155 --> 00:10:52,631
Call the police and ambulance.

165
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:54,155
Right away!

166
00:10:57,955 --> 00:10:59,955
What was that voice all about?

167
00:11:02,255 --> 00:11:03,955
Is anything wrong?

168
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:07,455
Hello, police?

169
00:11:07,455 --> 00:11:09,355
The police?

170
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:15,955
No good, he's not breathing anymore.

171
00:11:15,955 --> 00:11:18,657
He probably died during the last 30 minutes.

172
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:22,455
Yes. The Karaoke shop in 3-chome!

173
00:11:22,455 --> 00:11:26,355
A customer is lying on the ground and...

174
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:29,455
This room is around the corner up ahead.

175
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,671
It's located at a blind spot from the cashier.

176
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:34,355
Up ahead around the corner

177
00:11:34,355 --> 00:11:38,055
are the men's room and a cigarette vending machine.

178
00:11:39,755 --> 00:11:43,355
Come to think of it, he went to the men's room.

179
00:11:49,755 --> 00:11:52,255
It's him after all.

180
00:11:52,255 --> 00:11:55,255
He's the man that was tailing us a while ago.

181
00:11:56,255 --> 00:12:00,155
If this man really is a FBI agent...

182
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:03,455
I hate to be tied down by anything.

183
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,455
Don't tell me that...

184
00:12:04,455 --> 00:12:08,455
I don't think I'll need it.

185
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:10,709
I hope not...

186
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:22,721
Don't tell me that it's him...

187
00:12:36,428 --> 00:12:38,737
According to the driver's license that the victim had on him,

188
00:12:38,928 --> 00:12:42,741
he is Mr. Tatsumi Moniwa, age 46.

189
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,128
Officer Tome.

190
00:12:44,128 --> 00:12:49,128
He's been hit on the head repeatedly with a blunt object.

191
00:12:49,128 --> 00:12:50,749
He's been beaten to death.

192
00:12:50,928 --> 00:12:54,228
Which means that the suit top...

193
00:12:54,228 --> 00:12:58,757
The killer probably put it over him to avoid being splattered with blood.

194
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:01,628
The other things that were left at the scene are...

195
00:13:03,228 --> 00:13:04,528
Inspector!

196
00:13:04,528 --> 00:13:07,328
This was found in the chest pocket of the victim's suit top.

197
00:13:08,328 --> 00:13:11,628
This is a compact camera.

198
00:13:11,628 --> 00:13:13,228
What on earth did he take pictures of?

199
00:13:13,228 --> 00:13:16,775
We've got to develop the film to find out.

200
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:18,228
Officer Chiba!

201
00:13:18,228 --> 00:13:19,428
Yes, sir!

202
00:13:21,628 --> 00:13:24,783
Develop this film immediately, will you.

203
00:13:25,028 --> 00:13:27,528
I got it.

204
00:13:27,528 --> 00:13:29,928
You're the one who is in charge of the reception desk

205
00:13:29,928 --> 00:13:34,328
at this karaoke box. And you discovered the body, right?

206
00:13:34,328 --> 00:13:35,528
Yes.

207
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:39,128
Did the victim have someone else with him when he came here?

208
00:13:39,128 --> 00:13:42,028
No. He came alone

209
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:44,803
but he made a queer request at that time.

210
00:13:45,028 --> 00:13:46,805
A queer request?

211
00:13:47,028 --> 00:13:49,228
He asked me to let him know

212
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:52,428
when the high school students with the child are ready to leave.

213
00:13:52,428 --> 00:13:54,228
-What? -What?

214
00:13:55,328 --> 00:13:57,928
When Ran and the others leave the room?

215
00:13:57,928 --> 00:13:59,528
Why did he ask that?

216
00:13:59,528 --> 00:14:01,828
He said he forgot something

217
00:14:01,828 --> 00:14:04,328
in the room that they were using when he came here,

218
00:14:04,328 --> 00:14:07,228
so that he wanted to search the room after they left.

219
00:14:07,228 --> 00:14:10,028
What was the thing he forgot?

220
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:13,528
I don't know. When I came to let him know that they were leaving,

221
00:14:13,528 --> 00:14:15,928
I found him like this.

222
00:14:15,928 --> 00:14:18,837
No, he wasn't looking for something he forgot.

223
00:14:19,028 --> 00:14:21,328
He was planning on tailing us again

224
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:23,828
once we left the karaoke shop

225
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:27,528
like he was doing before we came here.

226
00:14:28,628 --> 00:14:32,128
The reason he could've been tailing us

227
00:14:32,128 --> 00:14:35,728
was to watch and protect a certain person.

228
00:14:35,728 --> 00:14:39,628
Right. If this man is a FBI agent,

229
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,628
and if his mission was to do so...

230
00:14:42,628 --> 00:14:45,128
The most suspicious person

231
00:14:45,128 --> 00:14:49,928
would be the person this man was suspected to have been tailing.

232
00:14:49,928 --> 00:14:52,871
And that's Eisuke Hondo.

233
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:55,628
He doesn't like being tied down.

234
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,528
More than anything, he's been acting strange

235
00:14:57,528 --> 00:15:00,528
since coming back from the men's room.

236
00:15:00,528 --> 00:15:03,528
Well, it's also thinkable that he witnessed something

237
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:06,885
involved with the incident too, but...

238
00:15:07,128 --> 00:15:10,528
And after the victim went into this room,

239
00:15:10,528 --> 00:15:14,128
how many customers left this shop?

240
00:15:14,128 --> 00:15:16,128
I don't think anyone did.

241
00:15:16,128 --> 00:15:19,328
There were several customers that came, though.

242
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:22,928
First, those high school students with the child came

243
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:24,903
and went into room number 3.

244
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:27,428
Right after them, the customer who died came

245
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:29,428
and went into room number 5.

246
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,428
And after that, if I remember correctly...

247
00:15:32,428 --> 00:15:36,228
Dark coloured man entered room number 4.

248
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:39,228
A customer with a long face went into room number 2.

249
00:15:39,228 --> 00:15:40,919
And an elderly customer

250
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:43,828
went into room number 1, in that order, I think.

251
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:47,428
Which means that the killer daringly stayed here

252
00:15:47,428 --> 00:15:50,728
even after committing the murder?

253
00:15:50,728 --> 00:15:52,931
-What? -Don't tell me that you guys...

254
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:54,928
Are you suspecting us?

255
00:15:54,928 --> 00:15:56,935
Oh, no. Well, pardon me.

256
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:58,937
But, just in case,

257
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:00,939
can you all please give me your names?

258
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:05,228
"Kyota Honma (32), Customer Room 2" -Oh, I'm Kyota Honma.

259
00:16:05,228 --> 00:16:08,947
"Konji Arimoto (34), Customer Room 4" -My name's Konji Arimoto.

260
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:13,328
"Kunio Tamai (63), Customer Room 1" -I'm Kunio Tamai.

261
00:16:13,328 --> 00:16:18,328
In other words, to sum it up this is what happened.

262
00:16:21,528 --> 00:16:24,128
Please wait!

263
00:16:24,128 --> 00:16:27,528
You mentioned a dark coloured customer just a while ago, didn't you?

264
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:32,228
Yes. And that customer had someone with him.

265
00:16:32,228 --> 00:16:34,328
Yes, I am.

266
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:39,428
But, that person lying down on the sofa in my room right now.

267
00:16:43,728 --> 00:16:46,985
Hey, hey, don't get up yet!

268
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:49,628
Yeah, sorry.

269
00:16:50,728 --> 00:16:52,728
His voice is hoarse.

270
00:16:52,728 --> 00:16:55,928
Yeah, it's been trashed from singing too much while having a cold,

271
00:16:55,928 --> 00:16:58,628
so now the hoarse voice.

272
00:16:58,628 --> 00:17:00,999
But, this one was in this room all this time,

273
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,001
so this one has nothing to do with the incident.

274
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:06,128
But, he's got to have something to prove it.

275
00:17:06,128 --> 00:17:07,928
Proof?

276
00:17:07,928 --> 00:17:09,928
Are you all right, Eisuke?

277
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,628
You look pale again.

278
00:17:11,628 --> 00:17:13,028
I'm fine.

279
00:17:13,028 --> 00:17:17,628
Hey, don't tell me that you're the one who did it?

280
00:17:17,628 --> 00:17:20,528
I didn't do it, I just saw!

281
00:17:20,528 --> 00:17:22,128
Saw what?

282
00:17:22,128 --> 00:17:24,328
When I came back from the men's room the second time,

283
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:26,128
I went into the wrong room.

284
00:17:27,828 --> 00:17:31,029
I went into the room of that dark-skinned man.

285
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:33,928
Then...

286
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,028
Then what happened?

287
00:17:35,028 --> 00:17:39,328
He and that person was...

288
00:17:39,328 --> 00:17:42,028
was kissing!

289
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,328
-What? -What?

290
00:17:45,428 --> 00:17:48,028
I guess that was too much stimulation for a kid.

291
00:17:48,028 --> 00:17:51,728
Well, no. I don't think the issue is that he was a kid...

292
00:17:51,728 --> 00:17:54,228
You mean kissing in a karaoke shop is not allowed?

293
00:17:54,228 --> 00:17:55,328
No, that's not what I mean.

294
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:57,055
It'd be no big deal if you're a normal couple.

295
00:17:57,055 --> 00:18:00,628
But, I think it's natural that he'd be surprised to see two men doing so.

296
00:18:00,628 --> 00:18:05,063
-What did you said? -I understand.

297
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,528
How rude!

298
00:18:09,528 --> 00:18:11,728
I'm a woman!

299
00:18:13,628 --> 00:18:15,073
-What? -What?

300
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:18,828
A woman?

301
00:18:19,828 --> 00:18:21,728
Oh, I see.

302
00:18:21,728 --> 00:18:23,528
Oh, my apologies.

303
00:18:23,528 --> 00:18:26,228
Well, she body builds too,

304
00:18:26,228 --> 00:18:28,828
so it's no surprise you made a mistake.

305
00:18:28,828 --> 00:18:32,128
Oh, so that's what it was...

306
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:36,128
But, I'm glad. You were acting strange,

307
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:39,097
so I was worried.

308
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:43,101
I'm really glad.

309
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:47,105
Yes, I'm glad.

310
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:50,328
It's not that all suspicion on you has cleared yet.

311
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:52,728
Would you like to take a look at the images

312
00:18:52,728 --> 00:18:55,113
on the surveillance camera of the reception desk?

313
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:57,528
The room of the person who died isn't monitored,

314
00:18:57,528 --> 00:19:01,928
but you can see who left their room and when they leave.

315
00:19:07,328 --> 00:19:09,128
Someone's come out.

316
00:19:09,128 --> 00:19:12,128
First, it's Mr. Honma of room 2.

317
00:19:14,828 --> 00:19:17,128
You disappeared after going into the direction

318
00:19:17,128 --> 00:19:19,128
of the victim's room.

319
00:19:19,128 --> 00:19:20,628
I went to the men's room!

320
00:19:20,628 --> 00:19:23,928
You saw it, didn't you? That the men's room is in that direction.

321
00:19:24,928 --> 00:19:27,428
Next, it's Eisuke.

322
00:19:27,428 --> 00:19:30,028
I also went to the men's room.

323
00:19:30,028 --> 00:19:33,628
Mr. Honma just came out of the men's room.

324
00:19:33,628 --> 00:19:35,828
Yes, right. I am.

325
00:19:35,828 --> 00:19:38,528
Oh, he's back.

326
00:19:40,928 --> 00:19:44,228
After that it was Mr. Arimoto from room number 4.

327
00:19:44,228 --> 00:19:48,028
Yeah, I went to the restroom too.

328
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:51,169
Next is Mr. Tamai of room number 1.

329
00:19:51,328 --> 00:19:53,171
Did you also go to the restroom?

330
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:55,928
No, I went to buy some cigarettes,

331
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,828
but the brand I wanted was sold out,

332
00:19:57,828 --> 00:19:59,177
and I couldn't decide what other brand to get,

333
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:01,628
so I returned without buying anything.

334
00:20:01,628 --> 00:20:05,928
It's true he came back in about two minutes.

335
00:20:05,928 --> 00:20:09,187
Oh, Mr. Arimoto's back, too.

336
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:11,828
Eisuke hasn't come back yet.

337
00:20:11,828 --> 00:20:13,528
Right.

338
00:20:13,528 --> 00:20:15,728
Let's fast forward the monitor a little.

339
00:20:19,728 --> 00:20:22,328
Oh, he's come back.

340
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:31,209
Just as he said,

341
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:34,828
it seems he made a mistake and went into room number 4.

342
00:20:34,828 --> 00:20:36,228
Yes.

343
00:20:36,228 --> 00:20:39,217
After Eisuke returns to room number 3,

344
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:41,528
you're also on the camera.

345
00:20:41,528 --> 00:20:43,928
I told you just a while ago, didn't I?

346
00:20:43,928 --> 00:20:45,223
That I went to tell the man who died

347
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:48,528
that the high school students were leaving.

348
00:20:48,528 --> 00:20:50,328
But it could also be that you made everyone think so

349
00:20:50,328 --> 00:20:51,828
and actually went to kill him.

350
00:20:51,828 --> 00:20:53,828
I don't think so!

351
00:20:53,828 --> 00:20:58,028
I heard that person scream and went right away,

352
00:20:58,028 --> 00:20:59,237
but the blood of the person

353
00:20:59,428 --> 00:21:01,028
who was lying on the ground was practically dried.

354
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:03,241
Really?

355
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,928
What he said is true.

356
00:21:04,928 --> 00:21:09,247
Conan comes dashing out of the room in less than a minute

357
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,028
after the staff heads for the victim's room.

358
00:21:12,028 --> 00:21:14,528
Which means, the suspects are

359
00:21:14,528 --> 00:21:18,728
Eisuke and all you three.

360
00:21:21,528 --> 00:21:25,263
Okay, everyone, we're going to question each of you one by one,

361
00:21:25,428 --> 00:21:27,928
so please wait in front of your rooms.

362
00:21:27,928 --> 00:21:30,028
We want to look for something, too.

363
00:21:30,028 --> 00:21:33,271
Look for something?

364
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:35,273
The murder weapon.

365
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,628
The blunt object that was used

366
00:21:37,628 --> 00:21:41,928
to kill Mr. Moniwa is nowhere in sight.

367
00:21:41,928 --> 00:21:45,828
Right. The suspects are the four people who's entering

368
00:21:45,828 --> 00:21:49,287
and leaving each of their rooms are recorded by the surveillance camera.

369
00:21:49,287 --> 00:21:51,928
Mr. Tamai in room number 1,

370
00:21:51,928 --> 00:21:54,428
Mr. Honma in room number 2,

371
00:21:54,428 --> 00:21:56,928
Mr. Arimoto in room number 4,

372
00:21:56,928 --> 00:21:59,028
and...

373
00:21:59,028 --> 00:22:00,328
Eisuke.

374
00:22:01,328 --> 00:22:06,728
The victim was killed by being beaten on the head with a blunt object.

375
00:22:06,728 --> 00:22:10,128
But no such thing was found at the scene of the crime.

376
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:13,311
Did the killer have the murder weapon?

377
00:22:13,311 --> 00:22:16,528
It's a fact that Mr. Moniwa was tailing us.

378
00:22:16,528 --> 00:22:21,319
If he was a FBI agent who was watching and guarding Eisuke,

379
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:24,528
did Eisuke who didn't like it...

380
00:22:24,528 --> 00:22:29,728
No, is he really a FBI agent to begin with?

381
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:33,628
Who on earth could've killed Mr. Moniwa?

382
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:03,440
Next Conan's Hint:

383
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,820
"Shoes of the Suspects"

384
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,268
That hint is just like Cinderella.

385
00:24:08,268 --> 00:24:09,782
Just like Cinderella.

386
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:10,800
Yeah.
