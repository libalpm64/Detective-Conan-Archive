such as peaches and grapes are local specialties.

It looks delicious.

There's an ample amount of white peaches

makes a great difference in the response we get from the readers.

44
00:04:00,148 --> 00:04:02,948
You mean to tell me that maybe I was chosen

45
00:04:02,948 --> 00:04:05,148
because I'm Kogoro Mouri's daughter?

46
00:04:05,148 --> 00:04:06,848
I guess so.

Let go.

72

Police?

74
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,048
Wait.

75
00:05:43,748 --> 00:05:46,448
Ouch... my head hurts.

77
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:50,248
No, stay away.

Are you being pursued by someone?

79
00:05:52,348 --> 00:05:55,148
Pursued? Me?

80
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,448
No good. Nothing...

81
00:05:59,448 --> 00:06:01,248
I can't remember anything!

82
00:06:01,248 --> 00:06:02,948
My head hurts.

83
00:06:02,948 --> 00:06:05,248
What's your name, miss?

84
00:06:05,248 --> 00:06:07,248
Where did you come from?

85
00:06:07,248 --> 00:06:09,948
My name... I can't remember.

86
00:06:09,948 --> 00:06:11,348
I don't know.

87
00:06:11,348 --> 00:06:12,448
She.

88
00:06:12,448 --> 00:06:13,648
What's the matter?

89
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:18,048
My, she's the person we saw a while ago...

90
00:06:18,048 --> 00:06:20,648
Ran, call the ambulance.

91
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:21,648
Yes.

92
00:06:36,148 --> 00:06:37,248
Darn.

93
00:06:37,248 --> 00:06:40,648
I didn't get to eat my octopus rice.

94
00:06:40,648 --> 00:06:42,448
What the heck's going on?

95
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:50,848
Post-traumatic amnesia?

96
00:06:50,848 --> 00:06:55,248
It seems to be a sudden onset of memory loss caused by trauma.

97
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,048
There are bruises on her body too.

98
00:06:58,048 --> 00:07:00,048
Will she be able to regain her memory?

99
00:07:00,048 --> 00:07:02,448
I can't say for sure.

100
00:07:02,448 --> 00:07:05,948
Fortunately, there seems to be no damage to her brain,

101
00:07:05,948 --> 00:07:09,048
so all I can say is the possibility is not all that low.

102
00:07:09,048 --> 00:07:10,548
And...

103
00:07:10,548 --> 00:07:13,648
Didn't she have anything on her that could be used as identification?

104
00:07:13,648 --> 00:07:16,348
Dad, what took you so long?

105
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:17,948
How about it?

106
00:07:17,948 --> 00:07:20,048
She didn't have anything on her.

107
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:23,348
She had no cell phone, I.D. or wallet on her.

108
00:07:23,348 --> 00:07:24,748
Did you contact the police?

109
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:28,948
Of course, and we were being questioned until a while ago.

110
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,848
They said they'd investigate just to be safe,

111
00:07:30,848 --> 00:07:32,148
but that it's questionable

112
00:07:32,148 --> 00:07:33,648
whether there's any criminal activity involved.

113
00:07:33,648 --> 00:07:37,448
Which means, I'm not in need.

114
00:07:37,448 --> 00:07:39,948
Okay, octopus rice here I go.

115
00:07:39,948 --> 00:07:41,648
But you've got a job request.

116
00:07:41,648 --> 00:07:43,348
Job request?

117
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:45,748
Mr. Mouri... I believe?

118
00:07:46,748 --> 00:07:50,848
Yes. I'm the great Detective Kogoro Mouri.

119
00:07:50,848 --> 00:07:55,448
Please... Please investigate who and where I'm from.

120
00:07:55,448 --> 00:07:56,848
Please.

121
00:07:58,648 --> 00:08:01,048
Yes.

122
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:03,448
So, pops officially accepted her request

123
00:08:03,448 --> 00:08:08,248
and proceeded investigation of her past but...

124
00:08:08,248 --> 00:08:12,748
I asked her to draw a sketch of whatever came to mind.

125
00:08:12,748 --> 00:08:16,248
It's uncertain whether they are correlated in any way,

126
00:08:16,248 --> 00:08:18,648
but I think it's safe to say

127
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:20,348
that they are all parts of memory.

128
00:08:21,948 --> 00:08:23,948
Incomprehensible.

129
00:08:23,948 --> 00:08:27,548
Isn't this a bird? A crane?

130
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,248
I got it. It's a red-crowned crane.

131
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:32,748
This symbolizes the Kourakuen Garden.

132
00:08:32,748 --> 00:08:37,348
That's where we first heard her sing the song Evening Primrose.

133
00:08:40,948 --> 00:08:44,048
And, doesn't this one look like a cat?

134
00:08:44,048 --> 00:08:45,448
True.

135
00:08:45,448 --> 00:08:47,448
Speaking of a black cat...

136
00:08:47,448 --> 00:08:50,348
Right. Yumeji Takehisa.

137
00:08:50,348 --> 00:08:53,948
Right. The Yumeji Takehisa Art Museum.

138
00:08:53,948 --> 00:08:55,448
You remember it, don't you?

139
00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:57,348
Yes, I do.

140
00:08:57,348 --> 00:09:00,148
But, why was I in such a place?

141
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:04,548
I see, she still can't remember the critical fact that we seek.

142
00:09:04,548 --> 00:09:07,548
But there're things we did find out.

143
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:11,948
All these sketches are undoubtedly of places that you've been.

144
00:09:11,948 --> 00:09:13,848
The places I've been to?

145
00:09:13,848 --> 00:09:16,048
Yes. I can't be all that sure,

146
00:09:16,048 --> 00:09:17,448
but that is a possibility.

147
00:09:17,448 --> 00:09:19,848
What other things can you figure out?

148
00:09:19,848 --> 00:09:21,748
This is a peach, isn't it?

149
00:09:21,748 --> 00:09:25,048
And this one is grapes?

150
00:09:25,048 --> 00:09:26,348
It could be.

151
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:29,248
But since both are local specialties,

152
00:09:29,248 --> 00:09:31,448
it's difficult to specify the location.

153
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:35,448
We've got one more clue to go on.

154
00:09:35,448 --> 00:09:37,048
That cell phone.

155
00:09:38,248 --> 00:09:40,248
Please, let me listen to it once more.

156
00:09:40,248 --> 00:09:41,648
Who the heck are you?

157
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:42,748
Please.

158
00:09:43,748 --> 00:09:46,648
Yes, I remember that too,

159
00:09:46,648 --> 00:09:51,648
but I still can't remember why I did something like that.

160
00:09:53,648 --> 00:09:55,148
Leave it to me.

161
00:09:55,148 --> 00:09:59,448
I, Kogoro Mouri will cut the Gordian Knot

162
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:01,448
and help get your memory back.

163
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:02,548
Excuse me.

164
00:10:02,548 --> 00:10:07,148
Oh, no. I'm sorry, I've got to write my article.

165
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,748
Well... I just got word from the editor

166
00:10:09,748 --> 00:10:12,148
to slightly change the contents of the article.

167
00:10:12,148 --> 00:10:13,348
Change?

168
00:10:17,648 --> 00:10:19,948
Just what do you mean?

169
00:10:19,948 --> 00:10:22,348
We're going to upload her picture,

170
00:10:22,348 --> 00:10:24,348
sketches that she'd drawn

171
00:10:24,348 --> 00:10:26,748
as well as the Great Detective Sleeping Kogoro

172
00:10:26,748 --> 00:10:29,648
investigating the case on our Town Magazine Website.

173
00:10:29,648 --> 00:10:31,248
I'm sure we'll get great response.

174
00:10:31,248 --> 00:10:33,348
But, is it going to be all right?

175
00:10:33,348 --> 00:10:35,848
What about your all important report on sweets?

176
00:10:35,848 --> 00:10:37,648
Sweets and mystery,

177
00:10:37,648 --> 00:10:40,248
we're continuing on with these two topics.

178
00:10:40,248 --> 00:10:44,248
As for me, I'd like to go with just one topic, sweets though.

179
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:50,948
"Okayama Electric Tramway" -We attempted to retrace her memories

180
00:10:50,948 --> 00:10:54,248
based on her sketches

181
00:10:54,248 --> 00:10:56,048
but, aside from the red-crowned crane and the black cat,

182
00:10:56,048 --> 00:10:59,248
we failed to find places matching her sketches.

183
00:10:59,248 --> 00:11:01,648
She wasn't able to regain her memory either.

184
00:11:10,248 --> 00:11:12,648
We're being followed?

185
00:11:12,648 --> 00:11:14,548
If I'm not mistaken, back then...

186
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:17,048
Ran, call an ambulance.

187
00:11:17,048 --> 00:11:18,048
Okay.

188
00:11:19,348 --> 00:11:20,748
The same person?

189
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:21,748
Okay, then.

190
00:11:25,748 --> 00:11:28,148
Conan, not that way.

191
00:11:28,148 --> 00:11:29,248
Shoots.

192
00:11:34,848 --> 00:11:35,948
Darn it.

193
00:11:39,848 --> 00:11:42,648
What's the matter, Conan?

194
00:11:42,648 --> 00:11:45,448
Nope, it's nothing.

195
00:11:48,248 --> 00:11:50,948
Is anything the matter?

196
00:11:50,948 --> 00:11:53,948
Did you recall something new?

197
00:11:53,948 --> 00:11:54,948
Quiet.

198
00:12:02,448 --> 00:12:03,748
Where?

199
00:12:03,748 --> 00:12:05,348
Where is this sound coming from?

200
00:12:07,448 --> 00:12:10,248
See, it's recorded all right.

201
00:12:10,248 --> 00:12:12,048
How beautiful.

202
00:12:14,348 --> 00:12:17,548
Please let me listen to it.

203
00:12:19,048 --> 00:12:21,648
Yes, go ahead.

204
00:12:21,648 --> 00:12:23,948
Grandma.

205
00:12:23,948 --> 00:12:27,848
Where did you record that?

206
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:29,348
This was from...

207
00:12:30,348 --> 00:12:32,248
"Nozaki former residence" -It was from the Nozaki residence

208
00:12:32,248 --> 00:12:34,248
who made a fortune from the salt farm business.

209
00:12:34,248 --> 00:12:37,848
Their residence was also known as the "Salt Palace."

210
00:12:48,148 --> 00:12:49,748
"Water Zither Cave Suikinkutsu"

211
00:12:49,748 --> 00:12:51,948
Suikinkutsu...

212
00:12:51,948 --> 00:12:54,448
is composed of an urn buried underground

213
00:12:54,448 --> 00:12:55,748
with an open hole atop

214
00:12:55,748 --> 00:12:57,748
allowing droplets from the water basin to drip through

215
00:12:57,748 --> 00:12:59,148
and echo inside,

216
00:12:59,148 --> 00:13:01,048
it's a refined device uniquely found

217
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:03,248
in Japanese gardens, it says.

218
00:13:03,248 --> 00:13:05,648
It sounds really beautiful.

219
00:13:05,648 --> 00:13:09,648
So, you're certain that you heard this sound here?

220
00:13:09,648 --> 00:13:12,548
Yes. Most likely.

221
00:13:12,548 --> 00:13:13,748
But...

222
00:13:13,748 --> 00:13:17,248
You still can't remember why you came here, right?

223
00:13:17,248 --> 00:13:19,448
No.

224
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:21,548
Mayuko?

225
00:13:21,548 --> 00:13:23,348
Where were you?

226
00:13:23,348 --> 00:13:26,548
I was looking for you all this time.

227
00:13:26,548 --> 00:13:28,748
It's me, Kanae.

228
00:13:28,748 --> 00:13:30,548
Your friend.

229
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:32,548
Kanae?

230
00:13:32,548 --> 00:13:34,648
That's right, Mayuko.

231
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,448
Mayuko?

232
00:13:44,815 --> 00:13:48,815
"Mayuko Kichise (25)" -Mayuko Kichise is my name?

233
00:13:48,815 --> 00:13:53,215
"Kanae Nonomiya (25)" -Yes, you're Kanae Nonomiya's friend, my friend.

234
00:13:53,215 --> 00:13:56,315
Kanae, my friend.

235
00:13:57,315 --> 00:14:00,315
We got some response on our website too.

236
00:14:00,315 --> 00:14:04,415
She is Ms. Mayuko Kichise who works at a cafe in Okayama City.

237
00:14:04,415 --> 00:14:07,815
The customers and staff at the cafe are posting.

238
00:14:07,815 --> 00:14:09,415
There's no mistake about it.

239
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:12,715
That's where I got to know Mayuko too.

240
00:14:12,715 --> 00:14:14,015
What about her family?

241
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,715
Her parents.

242
00:14:15,715 --> 00:14:19,115
Something about they died of an illness when she was little.

243
00:14:19,115 --> 00:14:20,815
She seems to have no relatives either,

244
00:14:20,815 --> 00:14:23,515
and I've heard before that she was completely alone.

245
00:14:24,815 --> 00:14:26,315
How about it?

246
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:28,215
Now do you remember something?

247
00:14:31,415 --> 00:14:33,015
I'm sorry.

248
00:14:33,015 --> 00:14:34,815
No good?

249
00:14:34,815 --> 00:14:38,315
You said that you were looking all over for Mayuko, didn't you?

250
00:14:38,315 --> 00:14:41,915
Yes. But, I had no idea that she had amnesia.

251
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:43,715
What shall I do?

252
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:45,915
If she stays as is, my older brother will...

253
00:14:47,315 --> 00:14:49,915
What's this about your older brother?

254
00:14:49,915 --> 00:14:51,415
Please, Mayuko.

255
00:14:51,415 --> 00:14:52,615
Please try to remember.

256
00:14:52,615 --> 00:14:55,215
My older brother... Please help him.

257
00:14:59,215 --> 00:15:00,715
The night before yesterday,

258
00:15:00,715 --> 00:15:03,415
from this jewelry store in Okayama City,

259
00:15:03,415 --> 00:15:07,115
three billion yen worth of valuables were stolen

260
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,615
and the man arrested as a suspect was,

261
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:14,315
"Keigo Nonomiya (28)" -Mr. Keigo Nonomiya, Kanae's older brother.

262
00:15:14,315 --> 00:15:15,715
According to the news,

263
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,415
the police found him unconscious

264
00:15:17,415 --> 00:15:21,815
in front of the emergency exit beside the store.

265
00:15:21,815 --> 00:15:24,315
At that time, part of the jewelry that was stolen,

266
00:15:24,315 --> 00:15:27,015
was found in his possession.

267
00:15:27,015 --> 00:15:30,415
Since my brother had a previous record of theft,

268
00:15:30,415 --> 00:15:34,215
they arrested on charges of being one of the robbers in the group.

269
00:15:34,215 --> 00:15:37,615
But when I visited him at the police,

270
00:15:37,615 --> 00:15:39,815
my brother definitely told me that he was innocent.

271
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:41,915
My brother just happened to pass by that road.

272
00:15:41,915 --> 00:15:46,415
Then he was attacked by the culprit there,

273
00:15:46,415 --> 00:15:50,015
and set up as a scapegoat.

274
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,415
And...

275
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:54,115
I... witnessed that?

276
00:15:55,115 --> 00:15:59,315
He said, "She's undoubtedly your friend Mayuko."

277
00:15:59,315 --> 00:16:02,415
"She's the only one that can prove my innocence,

278
00:16:02,415 --> 00:16:06,015
so please have her testify."

279
00:16:06,015 --> 00:16:08,315
That's why I kept on looking for her.

280
00:16:08,315 --> 00:16:10,715
Is that so?

281
00:16:10,715 --> 00:16:13,615
Mayuko, can't you remember anything?

282
00:16:14,915 --> 00:16:16,815
I'm sorry.

283
00:16:16,815 --> 00:16:18,615
Leave everything to me.

284
00:16:18,615 --> 00:16:21,815
You can count on me, the great Detective Kogoro Mouri.

285
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:25,015
Mayuko's loss of memory

286
00:16:25,015 --> 00:16:26,715
may be due to the fact that the culprit came

287
00:16:26,715 --> 00:16:28,915
after her to shut her up.

288
00:16:28,915 --> 00:16:32,115
I see. That's possible.

289
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:34,515
If you regain your memory,

290
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:36,415
the robbery case will be solved.

291
00:16:36,415 --> 00:16:38,415
We'll be killing two birds with one stone.

292
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:42,315
Do you know where Mayuko lives?

293
00:16:42,315 --> 00:16:44,115
Yes, of course.

294
00:16:44,115 --> 00:16:46,115
That's it. If we go there,

295
00:16:46,115 --> 00:16:49,015
we may be able to come up with something.

296
00:16:49,015 --> 00:16:52,615
Mayuko explained the situation to the landlord,

297
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:55,915
and we decided to investigate Mayuko's room.

298
00:16:57,215 --> 00:16:58,215
Look.

299
00:17:00,815 --> 00:17:01,915
This is...

300
00:17:01,915 --> 00:17:05,215
Isn't this one side of Mayuko's pierced earring?

301
00:17:05,215 --> 00:17:10,115
Which means she fell down these stairs and lost her memory?

302
00:17:22,415 --> 00:17:24,315
What's going on here?

303
00:17:33,115 --> 00:17:35,115
This is a badge?

304
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:41,615
The person in this picture most probably messed this place up.

305
00:17:41,615 --> 00:17:43,915
From the looks of the photo,

306
00:17:43,915 --> 00:17:45,615
could he be her boyfriend?

307
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:48,315
My room?

308
00:17:48,315 --> 00:17:50,315
My boyfriend?

309
00:17:50,315 --> 00:17:55,515
Kanae, have you ever seen this person around Mayuko before.

310
00:17:55,515 --> 00:18:00,415
No, because Mayuko never liked to talk about things like that.

311
00:18:00,415 --> 00:18:04,615
I can't... I can't recall anything, my head hurts.

312
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:06,515
Are you all right?

313
00:18:06,515 --> 00:18:09,515
Don't you think she should rest a while, dad?

314
00:18:09,515 --> 00:18:11,215
Yes.

315
00:18:12,315 --> 00:18:15,915
This is an order form for custom made jeans?

316
00:18:15,915 --> 00:18:18,315
The order date is three days ago,

317
00:18:18,315 --> 00:18:20,515
a day before the robbery case.

318
00:18:22,615 --> 00:18:25,015
This shop is famous.

319
00:18:26,115 --> 00:18:28,115
We headed for the Betty Smith Museum in Kojima,

320
00:18:28,115 --> 00:18:30,715
the district famous for being the place

321
00:18:30,715 --> 00:18:34,315
where jeans in Japan originated.

322
00:18:34,315 --> 00:18:36,315
"Betty Smith Museum"

323
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,115
I remember.

324
00:18:38,115 --> 00:18:42,415
She did order custom made jeans.

325
00:18:42,415 --> 00:18:44,915
Like the one and only jeans in the world,

326
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,115
I'm going to live a life of my very own.

327
00:18:48,115 --> 00:18:50,015
A life of my very own...

328
00:18:51,615 --> 00:18:54,515
I've heard her say it before too.

329
00:18:54,515 --> 00:18:56,915
Although you were a tomboy from before,

330
00:18:56,915 --> 00:18:59,515
you were prone to believe people immediately, and was usually deceived.

331
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:02,315
Each time you tried to get back on your feet, you were betrayed.

332
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:04,415
Your life was a repetition of this.

333
00:19:04,415 --> 00:19:08,015
So, you swore to yourself that you would shape up

334
00:19:08,015 --> 00:19:10,815
and said you would start living a life of your very own.

335
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:13,515
You told me so yourself, Mayuko.

336
00:19:13,515 --> 00:19:15,915
I said something like that?

337
00:19:17,015 --> 00:19:20,315
Shall we head off for lunch?

338
00:19:20,315 --> 00:19:23,915
They have pretty good octopus rice in this area.

339
00:19:23,915 --> 00:19:26,815
Octopus rice sounds good.

340
00:19:29,915 --> 00:19:30,915
Wait...

341
00:19:31,915 --> 00:19:33,615
Welcome.

342
00:19:33,615 --> 00:19:36,615
I'll show you the way. So one moment please.

343
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:46,915
It looks good.

344
00:19:46,915 --> 00:19:50,115
Dad.

345
00:19:50,115 --> 00:19:51,315
Mr. Nashida.

346
00:19:53,015 --> 00:19:55,315
Mr. Taira?

347
00:19:55,315 --> 00:19:57,515
"Kenzo Taira (40)" -Yes, I'm Taira.

348
00:19:57,515 --> 00:20:00,315
Long time no see, Mr. Nashida.

349
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:03,015
You look really pleasantly different.

350
00:20:03,015 --> 00:20:04,815
How embarrassing.

351
00:20:04,815 --> 00:20:06,515
I don't mean to go through any image change

352
00:20:06,515 --> 00:20:08,115
or something like that.

353
00:20:08,115 --> 00:20:10,015
The fact is, I'm thinking of turning a new leaf,

354
00:20:10,015 --> 00:20:13,015
and open up a new shop soon.

355
00:20:13,015 --> 00:20:14,615
That's really something.

356
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:17,215
I'll report it on the next article.

357
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:18,715
Let me introduce him.

358
00:20:18,715 --> 00:20:23,715
He's Mr. Kenzo Taira, a pastry maker living in Okayama.

359
00:20:23,715 --> 00:20:28,515
Mr. Nashida, you used to be a famous sommelier yourself too.

360
00:20:28,515 --> 00:20:30,815
Thanks to the wine you chose for me,

361
00:20:30,815 --> 00:20:33,115
I was able to make masterpiece sweets.

362
00:20:33,115 --> 00:20:35,415
Is that right?

363
00:20:35,415 --> 00:20:36,915
How embarrassing.

364
00:20:36,915 --> 00:20:39,315
The fact is while being in charge of gourmet articles

365
00:20:39,315 --> 00:20:40,615
for the Town Magazine,

366
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:43,715
I'm waiting for a chance to make a comeback.

367
00:20:45,315 --> 00:20:47,415
I'll be seeing you, then.

368
00:20:47,415 --> 00:20:49,315
Oh, yes, see you.

369
00:20:56,115 --> 00:20:58,515
Hello, editor.

370
00:20:59,615 --> 00:21:02,715
Right now?

371
00:21:02,715 --> 00:21:05,315
Yes, sir.

372
00:21:05,315 --> 00:21:09,315
I'm sorry, the editor just called me.

373
00:21:09,315 --> 00:21:11,415
I'll be back in about an hour,

374
00:21:11,415 --> 00:21:13,315
so please go on and eat without me.

375
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:14,415
All right.

376
00:21:14,415 --> 00:21:15,715
I see.

377
00:21:15,715 --> 00:21:17,315
This is, if you take a good look at it,

378
00:21:17,315 --> 00:21:20,415
doesn't it look like a rice cooker?

379
00:21:20,415 --> 00:21:22,415
Now that you mentioned it.

380
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:25,915
It could be a fragment of your memory of having eaten somewhere.

381
00:21:26,915 --> 00:21:28,315
I'm sorry.

382
00:21:28,315 --> 00:21:31,315
I can't remember anything after all.

383
00:21:31,315 --> 00:21:32,515
I'm sorry.

384
00:21:32,515 --> 00:21:34,315
-Mayuko, please wait. -Hey, wait.

385
00:21:34,315 --> 00:21:35,615
Dad.

386
00:21:37,515 --> 00:21:38,615
Conan.

387
00:21:41,015 --> 00:21:42,015
This is?

388
00:21:43,515 --> 00:21:46,315
If you want to know of your past, find a place to be alone.

389
00:21:47,815 --> 00:21:49,115
Conan!

390
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:58,415
Conan.

391
00:22:08,715 --> 00:22:12,115
"No matter how long I wait"

392
00:22:12,115 --> 00:22:15,715
"Seto Ohashi Bridge" -"No matter how long I wait"

393
00:22:15,715 --> 00:22:20,115
"He never shows up"

394
00:22:21,115 --> 00:22:31,715
"Sad like the evening primrose"

395
00:22:37,115 --> 00:22:38,315
Ms. Mayuko.

396
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,615
Darn.

397
00:22:39,615 --> 00:22:41,015
Are we too late?

398
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,040
Next Conan's Hint:

399
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,620
"Grapes".

400
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,240
Isn't there a way to regain loss memory?

401
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,040
I lose my memory at times too.

402
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:41,230
You know yourself, don't you?
