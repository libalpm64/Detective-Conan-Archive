1
00:00:22,972 --> 00:00:24,672
Today's stage is at an ordinary apartment complex.

2
00:00:24,672 --> 00:00:25,872
Is it an accident or a homicide?

3
00:00:25,872 --> 00:00:27,872
There is a blind spot that cannot be seen in ordinary life.

4
00:00:27,872 --> 00:00:29,372
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,372 --> 00:00:31,172
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,172 --> 00:00:33,072
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:07,011
Move it!

8
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:08,611
You, get out of here!

9
00:02:10,511 --> 00:02:13,411
You crows sure a nuisance, I tell you.

10
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:30,011
Shoots. There's not much of anything here.

11
00:03:11,911 --> 00:03:17,511
"City Crows"

12
00:03:23,611 --> 00:03:25,711
I think something happened.

13
00:03:30,111 --> 00:03:32,011
I wonder what kind of case it is?

14
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,711
Hey, no, stand back.

15
00:03:34,711 --> 00:03:36,311
What's with you, kids?

16
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:39,411
Please give us the details, Officer Chiba.

17
00:03:39,411 --> 00:03:41,311
No.

18
00:03:45,211 --> 00:03:48,411
-That's... -A homicide?

19
00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:49,811
Homicide?

20
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:50,811
-Just as I thought! -How frightening!

21
00:03:50,811 --> 00:03:53,711
No! It's not a murder case, it's an accident!

22
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:55,811
An accident?

23
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:57,811
You guys are really something.

24
00:03:57,811 --> 00:04:00,711
To be honest, someone died.

25
00:04:00,711 --> 00:04:02,711
It was a grandma who used to live here alone.

26
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:05,611
Her name is Tatsue Egami.

27
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:08,811
When she was coming back home,

28
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:12,411
a flower pot happened to fall and hit her on the head.

29
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:16,011
That fell on her head?

30
00:04:16,011 --> 00:04:18,711
But where did it fall from?

31
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:24,311
Hanging them like that is dangerous.

32
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:26,811
It's not strange if it fell anytime.

33
00:04:26,811 --> 00:04:28,211
That's unacceptable.

34
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:31,711
What kind of person is living there?

35
00:04:31,711 --> 00:04:33,811
Room 404.

36
00:04:33,811 --> 00:04:37,111
It's the apartment that the late Tatsue Egami lived in.

37
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:43,011
So, that grandma got hit in the head by the plant she was growing?

38
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:45,611
That is what we believe happened.

39
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:48,811
That's too bad for that Grandma.

40
00:04:48,811 --> 00:04:51,611
It's true that it's bad for her, but...

41
00:04:51,611 --> 00:04:52,711
Officer Chiba!

42
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:54,011
How was it?

43
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:57,211
The neighbors tried to warn her about the danger.

44
00:04:57,211 --> 00:05:00,811
They asked her to put the pots inside,

45
00:05:00,811 --> 00:05:03,411
but she didn't listen to them.

46
00:05:03,411 --> 00:05:06,511
I see. So if she had listened,

47
00:05:06,511 --> 00:05:09,411
this wouldn't have happened because of crows.

48
00:05:09,411 --> 00:05:12,211
Crows?

49
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:13,611
Don't you see them?

50
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:15,411
They're everywhere.

51
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:21,111
Since it's on the 4th floor,

52
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:23,411
it's not likely that a stray cat did it.

53
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:25,311
One of those probably dropped the planter

54
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:27,411
with either their beak or feet.

55
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:40,411
Crows sure are strong, aren't they?

56
00:05:40,411 --> 00:05:43,511
I wonder if the crow is really the one who did this?

57
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,411
There are no witnesses.

58
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:46,711
Since it was early in the morning,

59
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:48,611
there seems to have been no one around, too.

60
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:51,411
Maybe someone who lives opposite here saw something.

61
00:05:57,311 --> 00:06:00,611
Right. As you can see, it's impossible.

62
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:02,311
To be killed by a crow,

63
00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:04,911
I'm starting to feel more and more sorry for granny.

64
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:07,211
There are people making sarcastic remarks

65
00:06:07,211 --> 00:06:10,011
like a crow was killed by a crow.

66
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:12,211
A crow killed by a crow?

67
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:17,911
It seems that Tatsue Egami was called "grandmother crow" behind her back.

68
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,911
Grandmother crow?

69
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:22,911
She used to go out early in the morning to make her rounds

70
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:26,211
going through the trash that other people threw out.

71
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:29,111
Moreover, she seems to have always worn only black clothes.

72
00:06:30,511 --> 00:06:33,711
That's why she was called grandmother crow, huh?

73
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:36,411
She had a pretty bad reputation, too.

74
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:38,611
They couldn't stand her going through their trash

75
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:40,011
and invading their privacy.

76
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:43,111
There even seems to have been people who moved out.

77
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,711
She was disliked by everyone in the apartment complex.

78
00:06:46,711 --> 00:06:50,711
But why did she do such a thing as go through other people's trash?

79
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:53,311
Yeah. Well, what triggered it was...

80
00:07:01,211 --> 00:07:04,111
Gosh! How messy!

81
00:07:11,111 --> 00:07:12,611
The lottery ticket she found

82
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:15,411
happened to be one for 3rd place or something.

83
00:07:16,511 --> 00:07:20,011
So, she seems to have thought she could find something valuable again.

84
00:07:20,011 --> 00:07:22,111
That seems to have been the beginning of her reason

85
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,411
for going through trash.

86
00:07:23,411 --> 00:07:26,711
"Dream come to me once more..." She hoped, I guess.

87
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:29,011
They took on revenge on her

88
00:07:29,011 --> 00:07:30,911
because she went around looking into other people's trash.

89
00:07:30,911 --> 00:07:33,311
Revenge?

90
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:35,311
The crow got mad

91
00:07:35,311 --> 00:07:37,211
thinking that she was going to take away their food.

92
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:39,711
That's why the crow dropped the planter.

93
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:43,111
I see. The crow took revenge because it involved food.

94
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:47,411
It's possible because crows are smart.

95
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:49,311
The old lady seems to have made her rounds

96
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:51,111
of the trash dumps this morning, too.

97
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:53,111
And when she came back to the 1st floor doorway

98
00:07:53,111 --> 00:07:55,411
in order to return to her room,

99
00:07:55,411 --> 00:07:57,311
the planter seems to have fell from above.

100
00:08:04,911 --> 00:08:07,811
But isn't it strange?

101
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:11,411
The old lady came home from outside, didn't she?

102
00:08:11,411 --> 00:08:14,311
From that side then this way, right?

103
00:08:14,311 --> 00:08:16,911
Then she was going to enter that entrance.

104
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:18,311
Yeah.

105
00:08:18,311 --> 00:08:22,111
I wonder how she came from in front of the entrance to this side?

106
00:08:22,111 --> 00:08:23,611
Come to think of it, you're right.

107
00:08:23,611 --> 00:08:26,711
True. If she did go this way,

108
00:08:26,711 --> 00:08:30,411
even if the planter came falling, it wouldn't have hit her.

109
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:33,911
The fact is, we thought that was strange too,

110
00:08:33,911 --> 00:08:36,211
the minute we got here.

111
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:40,511
The refrigerator which was put outside as trash...

112
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:42,911
I mean, because one of her hands was inserted under it,

113
00:08:42,911 --> 00:08:44,611
and she was lying dead in a strange position.

114
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:49,511
But we figured the reason out

115
00:08:49,511 --> 00:08:51,411
after we looked under the refrigerator.

116
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:54,411
In other words, when she came back...

117
00:09:03,311 --> 00:09:04,711
Oh, no!

118
00:09:11,511 --> 00:09:13,811
And tried to retrieve her coin,

119
00:09:13,811 --> 00:09:16,711
the mischievous crow dropped the planter.

120
00:09:18,611 --> 00:09:22,011
Judging from the circumstances, this is probably what happened.

121
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:23,511
Convincing.

122
00:09:23,511 --> 00:09:26,111
I really feel sorry for the old lady.

123
00:09:27,911 --> 00:09:30,711
I wonder if such a coincidence exists.

124
00:09:30,711 --> 00:09:32,511
She happens to drop her coin and it just happens

125
00:09:32,511 --> 00:09:34,911
to roll under the refrigerator that is put out as trash.

126
00:09:34,911 --> 00:09:36,711
Right above her is a row of planters are lined up.

127
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:40,011
And just as she tries to retrieve her coin,

128
00:09:40,011 --> 00:09:42,011
the crow just so happens to drop the planter.

129
00:09:54,611 --> 00:09:55,911
Hey!

130
00:10:03,911 --> 00:10:06,211
"Closed for Safety"

131
00:10:09,711 --> 00:10:11,811
You can't make it out to the roof.

132
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,211
If so...

133
00:10:15,411 --> 00:10:18,111
What's up, Conan?

134
00:10:23,111 --> 00:10:26,811
The only way it can be done is from that room on the 5th floor.

135
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:29,511
"504: Imai, 404: Egami"

136
00:10:30,511 --> 00:10:31,711
You're...

137
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:33,811
Ms. Imai.

138
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:35,711
Thank you just a while ago.

139
00:10:35,711 --> 00:10:38,011
Thank you for doing your rounds.

140
00:10:38,011 --> 00:10:39,511
Have a nice day.

141
00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:41,011
Huh?

142
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:44,211
Good morning.

143
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,211
Good morning.

144
00:10:51,611 --> 00:10:53,811
Ayumi, do you know her?

145
00:10:53,811 --> 00:10:57,211
Well, she looks very familiar, but...

146
00:10:57,211 --> 00:11:01,311
She lives right above that old lady's room, right?

147
00:11:01,311 --> 00:11:03,711
Yeah. We asked her if she saw anything

148
00:11:03,711 --> 00:11:07,311
during our investigation.

149
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:10,311
Does she live with her family?

150
00:11:10,311 --> 00:11:13,811
No. I heard she was living alone.

151
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:15,811
But, is something about her bothering you?

152
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:18,711
I'll bet you fell in love at first sight with her.

153
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,211
Do you like older women like her?

154
00:11:23,111 --> 00:11:24,911
I wonder who she is.

155
00:11:24,911 --> 00:11:28,911
I know I met her somewhere before.

156
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:38,311
What? This is not an accident?

157
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:40,211
But a homicide?

158
00:11:44,411 --> 00:11:47,611
Yes. If the crow hooked its feet onto the planter,

159
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:51,211
it would have fell upside down or diagonally.

160
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,311
Naturally, if the planter fell on her head, it would crack to pieces.

161
00:11:56,011 --> 00:11:57,711
But that planter was cracked

162
00:11:57,711 --> 00:12:00,411
as if it had fallen bottom first.

163
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:03,911
Which means

164
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:06,611
it came falling straight down.

165
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:09,811
In other words, the planter was not hooked by the crow,

166
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:12,111
but rather, removed from the fence and dropped.

167
00:12:18,111 --> 00:12:20,811
Only humans can do something like this.

168
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:34,566
But, then who killed granny?

169
00:12:34,566 --> 00:12:37,466
The person living on the top floor.

170
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:40,066
What?

171
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,666
She's the only one who could've done it.

172
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:47,066
I checked and found that nobody can go out to the roof.

173
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:50,566
The one who can hang a planter from granny's window

174
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:52,566
is the one who lives on the floor right above her.

175
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:54,166
No one other than her could.

176
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:59,066
It's true that you can't do it from a lower floor.

177
00:13:00,266 --> 00:13:01,766
Please wait, Conan!

178
00:13:01,766 --> 00:13:05,266
It's true that she can hang a planter, but...

179
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:08,966
You're going to ask why granny was under the window, right?

180
00:13:08,966 --> 00:13:14,366
Yes, because granny went there only because she dropped her coin

181
00:13:14,366 --> 00:13:17,366
and it rolled under the refrigerator.

182
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:19,366
In other words, it was a coincidence.

183
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:20,366
Right!

184
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,966
It's true that, that part was a coincidence.

185
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:25,866
If so, your deduction won't work out, Conan.

186
00:13:25,866 --> 00:13:28,366
Because you can't possibly bring your target

187
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:31,366
to the place of your choice.

188
00:13:31,366 --> 00:13:32,466
Yes, you can.

189
00:13:32,466 --> 00:13:34,166
How?

190
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:38,366
Well, I've been thinking from morning, but I still don't know.

191
00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:41,966
-But I'm certain. -Wrong, Conan!

192
00:13:41,966 --> 00:13:44,166
She's not the kind of person

193
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,966
who would do a frightening thing like that.

194
00:13:45,966 --> 00:13:47,566
She's kind.

195
00:13:47,566 --> 00:13:50,966
So, do you know her after all, Ayumi?

196
00:13:50,966 --> 00:13:53,666
She wasn't wearing the usual uniform so I didn't recognize her,

197
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,266
but now I remember.

198
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:58,666
If I'm not mistaken, she works at the bakery in front of the station.

199
00:14:02,566 --> 00:14:05,266
So, you're still in 1st grade.

200
00:14:05,266 --> 00:14:08,366
Yes, I go to Teitan Elementary.

201
00:14:08,366 --> 00:14:11,866
You're really fantastic being able to run errands.

202
00:14:11,866 --> 00:14:14,766
No, not really. Anybody can do this.

203
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:17,366
Here you go. Thank you for waiting.

204
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:22,066
When I was in 1st grade, I was kind of dense.

205
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:25,066
Same here. That's how most of us are in 1st grade.

206
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:27,466
Right, that's how most of us are.

207
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:32,866
I was so embarrassed, so I haven't been to that shop since then.

208
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:36,166
She was nice enough to remember me.

209
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,666
I don't see how you can suspect someone as nice as her.

210
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,266
It's not a very good

211
00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:42,366
to suspect people right off the bat like that, Conan!

212
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:45,966
-Ayumi! -Ayumi!

213
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:47,966
-Conan! -Conan!

214
00:14:57,066 --> 00:15:00,866
No matter how much you think, there is no way to lure the old lady

215
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:03,366
to come right below the window.

216
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:06,866
The poor granny was accidentally killed

217
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:09,066
by a mischievous crow, after all.

218
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:13,866
No, there's got to be a way.

219
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:21,966
Hey, sonny, it's dangerous!

220
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:23,766
Could you wait a while?

221
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:29,266
So, that's the story.

222
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,866
What's the matter, Conan?

223
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:38,266
I've figured out

224
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:42,966
how she lured granny to go below the window.

225
00:15:42,966 --> 00:15:43,966
It's this.

226
00:15:43,966 --> 00:15:46,966
What's that?

227
00:15:46,966 --> 00:15:48,966
Don't tell me that this is...

228
00:15:48,966 --> 00:15:51,066
Yeah. It's the thing

229
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:53,666
that Grandmother Crow wouldn't miss for the world.

230
00:15:56,766 --> 00:15:59,266
Conan and the others really get me mad.

231
00:15:59,266 --> 00:16:02,866
How dare they suspect such a nice and kind lady.

232
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:08,566
Gosh! They're still investigating something on her!

233
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:13,866
Excuse me. About that lady that works at the bakery over there...

234
00:16:15,566 --> 00:16:16,766
Ayumi.

235
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:19,966
You know, Conan, how sad do you think a person would feel

236
00:16:19,966 --> 00:16:22,966
if she's suspected when there's no proof?

237
00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:24,166
Cut it out already!

238
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,966
Well, you see, Ayumi...

239
00:16:25,966 --> 00:16:29,066
We've found the evidence.

240
00:16:29,066 --> 00:16:30,666
What?

241
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,866
No way...

242
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:44,366
Did you want anything with me?

243
00:16:44,366 --> 00:16:48,266
About yesterday...

244
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:52,466
Can you show me your lottery ticket?

245
00:16:52,466 --> 00:16:55,166
You bought a lottery ticket yesterday, didn't you?

246
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,866
Just one ticket at the lottery ticket sales booth near the bakery.

247
00:16:57,866 --> 00:16:59,666
Please show me that.

248
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:03,566
You have it, don't you?

249
00:17:05,466 --> 00:17:07,066
Please show it to us.

250
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:09,866
You have it with you, don't you?

251
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:15,966
-It's okay already, Ayumi. -Yes.

252
00:17:15,966 --> 00:17:17,366
But...

253
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:22,166
It wasn't an accident that the planter came falling and hit granny.

254
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,266
Ayumi, although you insist that it can't be,

255
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:26,866
the only thing thinkable is that

256
00:17:26,866 --> 00:17:29,266
the lady living in that room above did it.

257
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:46,866
She hooked up granny's planter and got hold of it.

258
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:49,866
Next, you dropped a long string down to the floor.

259
00:17:49,866 --> 00:17:52,066
Then you stuck the lottery ticket that you bought

260
00:17:52,066 --> 00:17:54,766
on the tip of the string

261
00:17:54,766 --> 00:17:58,466
and put it by the entrance

262
00:17:58,466 --> 00:18:01,966
and waited for granny to return.

263
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:16,466
When granny tried to pick the lottery ticket up,

264
00:18:16,466 --> 00:18:18,266
you pulled the string.

265
00:18:22,866 --> 00:18:25,566
That way, you can position the granny at exactly where you needed.

266
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:28,866
I don't think you could see granny's head

267
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:32,066
because of the over-sized refrigerator.

268
00:18:56,266 --> 00:18:59,866
All you had left to do was retrieve the lottery ticket, right?

269
00:19:06,366 --> 00:19:10,566
The 500 yen was something that you had put there to begin with,

270
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,666
to camouflage an unnatural situation, right?

271
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,566
I couldn't figure it out at first,

272
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:19,466
but when the trash collectors came a while ago,

273
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:22,966
I noticed the traces of a string underneath the refrigerator.

274
00:19:25,366 --> 00:19:30,166
Moreover, the ripped part of the lottery ticket was found there, too.

275
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,266
With the torn piece of lottery ticket,

276
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:37,966
I'm sure we'll find your fingerprints on it.

277
00:19:39,566 --> 00:19:41,266
It's okay.

278
00:19:41,266 --> 00:19:43,766
You don't have to go out of your way to look for the fingerprints.

279
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:51,166
But, why? Why did you kill granny?

280
00:19:53,466 --> 00:19:57,166
She made me look like a fool, at the bakery I work for.

281
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,066
See, see.

282
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:07,266
I read your letter. What a laugh this letter is.

283
00:20:07,266 --> 00:20:09,166
Look at it.

284
00:20:10,266 --> 00:20:11,666
Why do you have that?

285
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,466
I ripped it and threw it away.

286
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:17,566
Oh, my trash.

287
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:19,266
That's right, you're grandmother crow.

288
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:21,466
You got it from the trash.

289
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:22,766
Give it back to me!

290
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:34,466
What are you so worked up about?

291
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:37,666
I'm going to enjoy myself with this letter for a while.

292
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:46,966
It was a letter of goodbye from my boyfriend.

293
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:52,166
How cruel.

294
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,366
I was trying to forget him.

295
00:20:54,366 --> 00:20:56,166
But she had the nerve to go out of her way to pick it up

296
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,866
and laugh about it on top of showing it to others!

297
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:00,166
But...

298
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:08,066
You're still little, so you may not understand.

299
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:11,366
But you'll eventually find out

300
00:21:11,366 --> 00:21:14,666
that there are things that people cannot forgive

301
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:18,666
even if it seems to be very trivial.

302
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:22,066
But no matter how unforgivable,

303
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:25,466
you're not supposed to take other people's lives, Noriko!

304
00:21:30,066 --> 00:21:31,866
You're right.

305
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,566
Will you please accept this?

306
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:55,166
I can't possibly take it with me, so...

307
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:00,366
What is it?

308
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:07,966
I understand

309
00:22:07,966 --> 00:22:11,866
how sad you must've been at that time even if I'm a child.

310
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:15,066
But...

311
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:18,166
what's bad is bad!

312
00:22:20,866 --> 00:22:23,466
Exactly, Ayumi.

313
00:22:26,966 --> 00:22:30,566
City crows sure are sinners.

314
00:24:32,093 --> 00:24:34,393
Next Conan's Hint:

315
00:24:34,393 --> 00:24:36,593
"Twins"

316
00:24:36,593 --> 00:24:37,793
The next episode has to do with synchronicity.

317
00:24:37,793 --> 00:24:38,793
It means something that occurs at the same time,

318
00:24:38,793 --> 00:24:41,093
that is, to attune to something.
