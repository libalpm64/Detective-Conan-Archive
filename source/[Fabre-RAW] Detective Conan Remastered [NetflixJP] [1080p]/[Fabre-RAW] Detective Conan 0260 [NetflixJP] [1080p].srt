1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,220
What lies in one's heart is a mystery to us all.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,120
Star and snow glitter on the two.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,820
The stage of today's show is at a restaurant.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,120
The table, foodstuff, and tricks of all kinds.

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,620
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,520
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,720
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,730
There's a lot of construction going on.

9
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,230
They're building a bypass.

10
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,580
Are you sure we're heading right direction?

11
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,680
Absolutely!

12
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,280
We've been wandering around for the past 30 minutes.

13
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,580
That hurts on an empty stomach.

14
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,080
I'm starved.

15
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,180
I know! Just keep on walking!

16
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,380
Gosh. You're not the only one who's starving.

17
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,680
Mr. Hanaoka!

18
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,080
Mr. Mouri.

19
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,680
Hello! I'm here again!

20
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,380
But I brought my family along tonight.

21
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,580
-Hello. -Hello!

22
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,980
"Shigeru Hanaoka (40)" -Well, well.

23
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,180
Welcome to my restaurant.

24
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,980
Please, come inside.

25
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,780
Oh, welcome.

26
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,580
Where have you been?

27
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,080
Well, just to get cigarettes.

28
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,080
Anway, we're having customers now.

29
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,580
"Reiko Hanaoka (30)" -Welcome, Mr. Mouri.

30
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,680
I'm sorry, I was changing the water for the flowers.

31
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,380
You changed the water just this morning.

32
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,580
The flowers last longer this way.

33
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,880
Mr. Mouri, this way please.

34
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,380
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,280
Oh, no. I can't get it off:

36
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,680
Please take the table at the middle.

37
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,980
Saki!

38
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,280
Yes, coming!

39
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:23,480
"The Shaking Restaurant"

40
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,930
Welcome.

41
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,630
Huh? I haven't seen you before.

42
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,130
"Saki Yoshizawa (20)" -I'm the new waitress here.

43
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,930
I'm Saki Yoshizawa. Nice to meet you.

44
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,330
I'm so sorry.

45
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,230
That's all right.

46
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,430
I'll get a towel right away!

47
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,130
Here!

48
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,430
Let me do it for you.

49
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,730
Thanks, Ran.

50
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,630
Show me the back side.

51
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,530
Good grief. You demand so much attention.

52
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,230
Sorry about that, Mr. Mouri.

53
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,230
"Minoru Wada (35)" -I'm sorry about the tremors

54
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,530
from the construction next door.

55
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,630
Well, the places really are shaking.

56
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,530
But we've been told that the tremors will stop soon.

57
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,530
We have to wait until 10pm tonight, and it will all be over.

58
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,930
I'm starved!

59
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,630
We have a big, fat sea bream today, sonny.

60
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,980
But I prefer fried prawn.

61
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,080
Okay, coming up!

62
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,280
Mr. Hanaoka.

63
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,580
You're closed tomorrow.

64
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,880
Are you going fishing for spearfish as usual?

65
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,180
Oh, yes! I'm planning to prepare the tackle and the bait tonight

66
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,080
and leave the first thing in the morning.

67
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,480
Spearfish fishing in the ocean breeze.

68
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,180
I envy you.

69
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,280
Thanks to his hobby, I'm left all alone on holidays.

70
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,280
Alone?

71
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,380
I'm no fool.

72
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,280
What do you mean by that?

73
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,680
What is it, dear?

74
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,180
Stop that! Were having customers!

75
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,080
Mr. Hanaoka, look.

76
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,880
Here, this picture.

77
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,580
This big fish. Is this spearfish?

78
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,180
Yes, that's right.

79
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:18,180
A fishing buddy who's also a photographer took that picture.

80
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,280
Mr. Hanaoka, how long have you been fishing?

81
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,880
Well, I think it has been 25 years maybe.

82
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,480
You know, I used to live in Hachijo Island.

83
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,280
Look! Is that you?

84
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,780
You're so young!

85
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,680
But this picture looks a little different from others.

86
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,580
Probably it was taken by an amateur.

87
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,380
If you look close enough,

88
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,580
the camera is focused on the chef and not the fish.

89
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,080
Usually, a photo like this is focused on the fish.

90
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,980
You know a lot about pictures.

91
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,880
Actually, I wanted to become a photographer once.

92
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,180
What's this?

93
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,880
One?

94
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,680
Conan!

95
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,580
Oh, Ms. Saki. Are you off work?

96
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,080
Yes.

97
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,080
You're here, too?

98
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,180
Oh, hello. Aren't you with your father?

99
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,680
He said he hasn't had enough yet and went drinking alone.

100
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,680
He's a dud of a father!

101
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,380
But you've still got one.

102
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,480
"The Last Super Detective"! I wanted to see this!

103
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,980
This is about a playboy detective, right?

104
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,280
Mr. Mouri must be having a good time

105
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,780
surrounded by young girl fans right now!

106
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,280
You must be kidding.

107
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,780
Freezing!

108
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:51,480
What luck! The bar closed!

109
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,880
This one's closed, too.

110
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,680
It's Hanaoka alone.

111
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,980
Right.

112
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,080
He must be working on the tackle and bait for tomorrow.

113
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,980
I'd rather not interrupt.

114
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,780
That's Mr. Wada, right?

115
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,180
Yes, Mouri here.

116
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,480
Hi, Ito!

117
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,080
Mahjong? Now? Where?

118
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,780
Next to Karantei? What coincidence!

119
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,680
Of course, I'm going. You bet I will!

120
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,280
Oh, I forgot!

121
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,480
What is it?

122
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,780
I need to buy bread for breakfast.

123
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,380
You can go ahead and go home!

124
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,680
But it's already late.

125
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,880
Let's go home together.

126
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,080
I'll wait for you here with Conan.

127
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,080
Right. You're safe with her since she knows karate.

128
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,480
Conan, that's embarrassing!

129
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,980
All right, I'll be back as soon as I can.

130
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,480
I told you you can go drinking,

131
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,780
but why do you have to drink until morning?

132
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,480
Stop yelling at me! It's ringing in my head!

133
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,380
You only get what you deserve.

134
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,680
I'd really love a hot cup of coffee here.

135
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,680
Did something happened?

136
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,780
What in the...

137
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,280
This... this is...

138
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,980
Sorry to tell you...

139
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,080
but he's been dead for quite some time.

140
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,280
Ran, call the police!

141
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,580
Okay!

142
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,580
Mrs. Hanaoka, where do you usually put this vase?

143
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,680
On the top of the stairs...

144
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,880
Could it be that the vase fell with the tremors?

145
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,780
Probably by some unfortunate coincidence,

146
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,680
it hit your husband's head.

147
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,580
By the way, who are you?

148
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:14,780
My name is Yamamoto, Mr. Hanaoka's friend.

149
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,580
"Koichi Yamamoto (40)" -We were planning to go spearfish fishing

150
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,480
at Hachijo Island today.

151
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,180
I had to wait for a long time for him.

152
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,680
Since I was told he's not home either,

153
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,580
I came here with his wife.

154
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:32,080
He was looking forward to go to Hachijo every year around this time.

155
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,080
There's a trace of blood forming straight lines.

156
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,480
-It hurts! -Don't touch the evidence!

157
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,180
I was just wondering whether the vase really hit Mr. Hanaoka.

158
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,780
There's blood on the inside of the hat.

159
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,180
It's proof that the vase hit his head!

160
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,680
But look. The flowers from the vase that fell.

161
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,780
They're withered compared to others.

162
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,380
I was just about to get to that.

163
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:12,280
True. The flowers here still look fresh.

164
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,380
Hey, Pops.

165
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,980
Dad!

166
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,880
See, there's a white fragment something on the floor...

167
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,880
It probably came from the ceiling.

168
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,080
If it's not to salt or sugar,

169
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,380
it's highly likely it's white paint from the ceiling.

170
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,780
We need to look into whether it has something to do

171
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,180
with the cause of Mr Hanaoka's death.

172
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,380
There's a fine scratch on the beam.

173
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,380
The paint must have peeled ff from here.

174
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,380
Okay! Let's check the other side!

175
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,580
And the window is open.

176
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,280
I knew it!

177
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,180
The same scratch I found on the beam!

178
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,080
The construction site is just outside.

179
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,580
This may not be an accident.

180
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,480
Huh?

181
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,380
Mr. Hanaoka may have been killed,

182
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,180
and it was set up to look like an accident.

183
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,480
No way...

184
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:28,890
Mrs. Hanaoka.

185
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,190
Mr. Wada, Saki...

186
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,690
A flower vase fell on my husband.

187
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,190
What?

188
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,990
And then? What happened to him?

189
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,990
He's been taken to the hospital for autopsy.

190
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,090
Autopsy?

191
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,490
That means...

192
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,890
Excuse me, but who are you two?

193
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,690
I'm Wada. I work here as a cook.

194
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,790
I'm Saki Yoshizawa, a waitress here.

195
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:03,690
Inspector, wasn't it an accident caused by a falling vase?

196
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:09,790
Mr. Hanaoka indeed died due to a falling vase.

197
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:13,290
However, it appears that the vase was dropped deliberately.

198
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,490
Deliberately?

199
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,090
Right!

200
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:19,390
I thought it was an accident at first,

201
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,490
but my investigation turned up a lot of things.

202
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:32,590
The autopsy showed he died between 11pm and 1am today.

203
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,290
However, we found that construction work

204
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:40,490
ended at 10:30 pm last night due to machine failure.

205
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,890
That means...

206
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,490
tremors from the construction site

207
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:48,090
couldn't have caused the vase to falls.

208
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,690
I'd like you to see something.

209
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,890
It was found at the construction site.

210
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,390
The line on the fork is used for spearfish fishing

211
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:04,190
and the line was tied to a steel frame.

212
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,990
The culprit used this line and the steel frame,

213
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,990
positioned the vase right above Mr. Hanaoka's head,

214
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,590
and made it fall.

215
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:16,890
I had Officer Takagi check the freezer in the back of the kitchen.

216
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,590
He found sea bream

217
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,190
and a few flower petals inside.

218
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,790
Which means the culprit

219
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:30,190
placed the fork with the fishing line into the vase with flowers

220
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,690
and placed the vase in the freezer.

221
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:38,490
Later, the frozen vase was placed instead of the other

222
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:41,390
right above Mr. Hanaoka's head as he was preparing his baits.

223
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,890
Moved on the pretense of changing water for the flowers.

224
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,290
And the line running along the beam

225
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,890
was tied to the line to the vase.

226
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:53,390
Later, the culprit went out to go to the construction site

227
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,990
and tied the line to the steel frame there

228
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,390
and slowly dropping it into the trench.

229
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:05,090
This way, the frame pulled the vase

230
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:08,590
and moved the vase right above his head.

231
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,990
As time passed, the ice inside the vase melted.

232
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,990
That's what really happened.

233
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,990
Amazing! He's done it again and he's awake this time!

234
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,490
By the way, it's your job

235
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,890
to take care of the flowers, isn't it?

236
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,990
Don't tell me you think I did it?

237
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:37,790
Why would I want to kill my husband?

238
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:43,190
This was found inside Mr. Hanaoka's locker.

239
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,690
What's this?

240
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:49,290
A report written by a private investigation firm.

241
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,090
This is a report on Mrs. Hanaoka's activities

242
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,790
that her husband requested.

243
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:57,790
This is a photo of her with...

244
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,490
Mr. Wada.

245
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,290
Yes, there is an accomplice in this case.

246
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,090
The one who created the contraption in the construction site

247
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,790
must be Mr. Wada.

248
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,090
By coincidence,

249
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:17,090
I saw Mr. Wada last night coming out of the construction site.

250
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,690
Extramarital affair.

251
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,690
So that is why you wanted to get rid off your husband.

252
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,290
Is that right?

253
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,990
I'm sorry!

254
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:37,290
Everything is true!

255
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,090
I'm very sorry.

256
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:44,090
Mr. Mouri! You're splendid as always!

257
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,890
Well, this is a piece of cake.

258
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,890
Get your foot off that chair!

259
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,290
What's that?

260
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,390
I didn't see that yesterday.

261
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,790
What's with you?

262
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,090
Pops, the shape of the scratch on the chair and the vase...

263
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,490
Hello, this is Megure.

264
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,290
Okay.

265
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,190
It was from Officer Chiba at the autopsy.

266
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,590
He says sea bream scales

267
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,190
were found in the collar and around the neck of the victim.

268
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,590
Seabream scales?

269
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:26,390
Fishing was his hobby.

270
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:30,390
So maybe they stuck there in an earlier fishing trap.

271
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,490
This is...

272
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,390
So, that's it!

273
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:45,390
Anyway, we need you both to come with us for further questioning.

274
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,690
Wait, Inspector.

275
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,290
Mr. Mouri?

276
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,890
The two are not the killers.

277
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,390
What?

278
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,490
Then, who is it?

279
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:03,590
Certainly, the two built that device.

280
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,490
But when the vase fell,

281
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:10,090
Mr. Hanaoka was already dead.

282
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,690
What?

283
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,890
The real culprit learned of the scheme to kill Mr. Hanaoka

284
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:16,890
and took advantage of it.

285
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,090
The trick will not work

286
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:23,290
unless Mr. Hanaoka sits exactly under the vase.

287
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:26,090
But it was totally unreliable.

288
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:30,790
That is why the culprit chose the most reliable way.

289
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,190
Which is by approaching Mr. Hanaoka from behind

290
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,690
and with the frozen sea bream...

291
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,490
hitting him on the head.

292
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,090
The simplest and sure-fire solution.

293
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,590
So, that's how the scales got there.

294
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:49,390
After killing Mr. Hanaoka, the culprit rushed to return

295
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,590
the sea bream to the freezer

296
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,590
and had a problem taking off the glove.

297
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,090
Because this person

298
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:00,190
had to go to a certain location as soon as possible.

299
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:04,090
To the video shop where Ran and Conan are waiting.

300
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,590
Isn't that right,

301
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,190
Saki?

302
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,590
Conan, show that to the Inspector.

303
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,790
Okay!

304
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,290
Here you are.

305
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,490
This is a rubber glove.

306
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:23,190
This was used during the murder.

307
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:26,390
I see a faint trace of lipstick.

308
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:31,190
Yes, the same color of lipstick Saki was using yesterday.

309
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,490
No.

310
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,990
Don't make me a killer just because I wear the same color.

311
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,590
You tried to take off the glove in a hurry

312
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,990
because you had to get to where they were waiting.

313
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,690
But the glove sticks and is hard to take off,

314
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,690
so you bit the tip

315
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,790
to remove it.

316
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:57,890
There is a bite mark believed to belong to a woman.

317
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,590
You can check and prove whose it is.

318
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,190
Is that true?

319
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:10,490
He deserved to be killed.

320
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:16,490
21 years ago, he was a fisherman in Hachijo Island.

321
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,790
There was a girl named Aiko Morimura

322
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:23,390
whom he promised to marry in the future.

323
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:27,290
But Hanaoka said he wanted to study cooking

324
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:30,290
and left the island and Aiko.

325
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:33,390
Aiko let him go without a complaint.

326
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:37,190
She didn't even tell him she was carrying his baby.

327
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,290
Aiko waited.

328
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,490
She had the baby by herself and waits for him to return

329
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,890
while raising her child.

330
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,990
She waited and waited

331
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,590
until she lost hope and died this spring.

332
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:56,790
Then, Aiko's child is...

333
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,190
I could not forgive him.

334
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:03,390
I could never forgive him!

335
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,690
Saki.

336
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,890
That photo...

337
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:11,090
That photo at table where Mr. Hanaoka sat all the time...

338
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:16,890
Isn't it most likely was taken by your mother?

339
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,590
What?

340
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:24,290
The focus is not on the fish but on Mr. Hanaoka.

341
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,890
It looks like a picture taken by somebody who loves him.

342
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,190
Look!

343
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,390
Mr. Hanaoka had the photo placed in the shop

344
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:46,790
and probably was looking at it all the time.

345
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:55,990
There is something that looks like the numeral 1

346
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,190
at the corner of the photo.

347
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,890
That probably stands for Aiko.

348
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,990
Aiko Morimura.

349
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,590
So what? What's that supposed to mean?

350
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,790
Are you telling me he should be forgiven

351
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,390
because he kept the photo and looked at it?

352
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:13,490
My mother is already dead! She worked hard,

353
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,690
led a hard life, and died alone!

354
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,190
If he really did think of her that much,

355
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,990
why didn't he contact her?

356
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,690
Why didn't he write her even once?

357
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:25,190
If he did, if he ever did...

358
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,890
my mother would still...

359
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,590
Saki.

360
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:38,990
I don't know why Mr. Hanaoka never contacted her,

361
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:44,090
but regardless of what he did in the past,

362
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:48,690
there must have been ways for you to tell him how you feel.

363
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:53,090
Ways other than committing something abominable like murder.

364
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,990
Amazing!

365
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,490
It's pulling, pulling hard. It must be a big one.

366
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,690
Hold on to it tight!

367
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,040
I'm ready to take it!

368
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,440
Ran, move back a little. I can't get the fish in the frame.

369
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,140
I can't move any more.

370
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,690
You move back, Dad.

371
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:45,890
Okay.

372
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,390
A bit more.

373
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,690
Just a bit more.

374
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,390
Dad, are you all right?

375
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,490
You're better off in front of the camera,

376
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,890
rather than behind it, Pops!

377
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,560
Next Conan's Hint:

378
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,460
"Footprints"
