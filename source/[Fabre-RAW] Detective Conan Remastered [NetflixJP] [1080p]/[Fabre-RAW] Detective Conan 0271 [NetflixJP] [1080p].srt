1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,020
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,120
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,520
What does the cross mean?

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,320
It's a coded case!

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,920
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,920
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,120
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,530
I think I've seen him before.

9
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,130
I know I've seen him.

10
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,430
But where did I meet him?

11
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,630
That man in the black knit hat.

12
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:14,630
And what is this thing I'm feeling?

13
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,730
This uneasiness that I feel like something is gonna break

14
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,330
if I try to remember what it was.

15
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,030
Yeah, at that time...

16
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,530
and that time?

17
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,430
It's the same bad feeling

18
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,030
-Ran... -I felt back then.

19
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,330
Ran!

20
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,930
Hey, Ran!

21
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,130
Ran!

22
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,730
My gosh.

23
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,230
What? Sonoko.

24
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,530
Why are you so slow?

25
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,230
Hey! Ms. Mouri!

26
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,030
Have you been paying attention to my lecture, Ms. Mouri?

27
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,930
Yeah. Yes!

28
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,630
Okay, then, Ms. Mouri.

29
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,130
Do you have any idea what that mark

30
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,230
on the blackboard means?

31
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,430
What?

32
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,230
Well...

33
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,330
Cross-mark.

34
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,630
Oh, no, maybe it's the letter X". I think?

35
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,430
Ran, that means...

36
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,030
Time's up!

37
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,330
Ms. Mouri, think about it

38
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,530
and give me an answer by the next class!

39
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,230
Find out exactly what that means.

40
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,430
It pays for a lady like you

41
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,530
to know what the cute mark is!

42
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,830
Okay?

43
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,330
Yes.

44
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:51,730
"Hide, Hurry up and Abbreviate it (Part 1)"

45
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,330
"X"?

46
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,230
Is there any special meaning?

47
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,430
Yeah! Ms. Jodie, our teacher,

48
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,230
mentioned it at the end of today's class,

49
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,530
saying that it was a cute mark.

50
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,730
Ran! No way! Impossible!

51
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,330
You can't get the right answer

52
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,930
from this snot nosed kid!

53
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,730
But, as you know,

54
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,330
Conan sometimes knows about the strangest things.

55
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,030
Yeah, true.

56
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:23,630
X...

57
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:28,130
In algebra, X represents an unknown quantity.

58
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,230
Or, it can mean a problem,

59
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,830
something unknown, or an unnamed thing.

60
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,930
X-ray means radiograph.

61
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,230
X rating means no one under 18 is admitted.

62
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,930
X day is a variable day

63
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,730
when people think something is going to happen.

64
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,130
Wait, if it is the cross,

65
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,330
the X means wrong or censored print.

66
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,130
One X can also mean that the person has been divorced once.

67
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,030
Right, right.

68
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,230
She said that it paid for a woman to know the mark.

69
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,430
What?

70
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,530
A woman?

71
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,930
That reminds me.

72
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,430
My mother used to write a series of crosses

73
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,830
at the end of the letter.

74
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,730
Like, XXX.

75
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:13,230
But she never told me what it meant even if I asked her.

76
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,630
But, Sonoko,

77
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,230
don't you think that Ms. Jodie's way of teaching has changed?

78
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,530
Yeah, yeah!

79
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,830
She used to be too serious and boring before.

80
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,530
But now, she teaches us casual English too

81
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,230
and I like it.

82
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,730
Hi! Remember this, flattery is not going to

83
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,130
get you better grades!

84
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,930
Ms. Jodie?

85
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,430
Ms. Mouri! Did you figure out what "X" means?

86
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,930
No, not at all.

87
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:47,230
Right! How about asking Shinichi about it by e-mail?

88
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,430
If you get the right answer,

89
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,330
I'll give you my sweet "X".

90
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,730
What?

91
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,730
My sweet X!

92
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,630
Oh, that's a good idea!

93
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,630
What?

94
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,730
You think so too, don't you?

95
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,830
What was that?

96
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,130
What does X mean anyway?

97
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:05,730
X...

98
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,030
But...

99
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,830
Aren't you heading in the opposite direction from your apartment?

100
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,230
Yes, now that you mentioned it.

101
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:15,330
Hey! There's something I want to ask you two.

102
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,030
Will you come with me?

103
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,030
X...

104
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,730
Cross?

105
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,130
What?

106
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,930
Are you asking if we are being sexually harassed?

107
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,030
-You mean us? - You mean us?

108
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,930
Oh, yes!

109
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,130
There are many girls of Teitan high School

110
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,830
who being sexually harassed on the trains and buses.

111
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,130
We've never been harassed, have we?

112
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,730
Yes.

113
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,930
And even if such a pervert tries to molest me

114
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:50,130
then Ran will bust him up with her karate skills!

115
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,230
Oh! You're her bodyguard!

116
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,830
No...

117
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,730
But still be careful!

118
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:03,030
Maybe the guy will follow you all the way home

119
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,430
waiting for a chance to get to you.

120
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:12,730
He may be a super scary and demon-like stalker.

121
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,730
If such a man is creeping around near my home,

122
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,130
the guard will grab and throw him out immediately.

123
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,530
I also haven't seen such a man around my neighborhood.

124
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,830
Right, Conan?

125
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,230
What?

126
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,730
Yeah.

127
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:26,730
Okay, then.

128
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,330
If you see any suspicious person,

129
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:33,330
please call me at once.

130
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,030
-Call you? -Call you?

131
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:40,930
Yes! Japanese people still underestimate the stalker.

132
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,830
If you call me, I'll give that guy

133
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,930
a good scolding, American style.

134
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,630
What?

135
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:53,230
A suspicious man is waiting in ambush for you?

136
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,630
"Norihisa Kisugi (50)" -Where are you now?

137
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,630
At the building where the coffee shop is.

138
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,530
I said a suspicious man but...

139
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,930
he may well be the man in question

140
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,430
who I have been checking on.

141
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,830
"Katsunori Chujo (43)" -When he meets me,

142
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,230
he'll probably say,

143
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,930
"I'll pay you double the reward you're getting,"

144
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,230
"so please let me go."

145
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,930
Yeah, listen, let's make a deal.

146
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,730
Okay!

147
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:21,830
I'll pay you triple!

148
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,230
No, quadruple!

149
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,330
So, please hurry and come over here now

150
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,830
and give me the guy's name and the evidence.

151
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,530
It's a deal. I'll be right over!

152
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:35,430
He can't pay me four times, so I guess he'll give it up.

153
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,530
Sorry, but that's the story.

154
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:40,430
No offense, Mr. Man-in-question.

155
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,730
Hey... I won't change my mind

156
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,230
even if you follow me around.

157
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,830
You're finished at any rate.

158
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,730
Because...

159
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,830
all the details of your evil doings

160
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,730
are contained in this envelope.

161
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,930
No.

162
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,130
What's going on?

163
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,130
Is it a black out?

164
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,830
Oh, the lights turned on again.

165
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,230
Oh, what a scare.

166
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,930
It can't be helped, Sonoko,

167
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,930
because you've experienced a blackout

168
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,430
in a building before...

169
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,830
Hey! It's right in front of this shop!

170
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,930
It is! I wonder what happened.

171
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,030
Ms. Mouri and Ms. Suzuki,

172
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,430
call the police and an ambulance!

173
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,530
Yes!

174
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,630
What?

175
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:09,330
Something was written on the envelope he's holding.

176
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,430
Circle, Cross, Triangle?

177
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,630
What's this?

178
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,030
A thrust with a knife into his abdomen.

179
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,430
Yes. The murdered victim is

180
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,630
Mr. Katsunori Chujo, 43 years old.

181
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,230
Judging from a name card he carried,

182
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,430
he is the director of a private detective agency.

183
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,030
Oh, a detective.

184
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,130
But what I don't understand is

185
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,330
this bizarre dying message.

186
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:49,830
No... It's a dying message!

187
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,430
Your...

188
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,630
Hi, I'm Jodie Saintemillion!

189
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:00,830
Nice to see you again, inspector.

190
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,630
Before you correct his English,

191
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,830
improve your Japanese first!

192
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,430
But you're the type who really gets involved

193
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,430
in all sorts of cases, aren't you?

194
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,630
Yes!

195
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,730
But I'm still no match for them!

196
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,930
Oh, you're also here, Ran and Sonoko!

197
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,830
When we were in that coffee shop,

198
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,430
the power suddenly went out.

199
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,330
And just after the lights turned on again,

200
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,430
we heard a woman scream.

201
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,730
Then, we came here and saw the man.

202
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,130
Blackout?

203
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,930
Yes, the blackout was caused by a mistake

204
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,630
made by an electrician during maintenance.

205
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,730
And the blackout lasted only fifteen seconds or so.

206
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,530
So, the murderer,

207
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,830
taking advantage of this coincidence.

208
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:55,630
Meanwhile, Mr. Chujo, just before dying,

209
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,230
left the odd dying message.

210
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,530
But, what's this?

211
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,630
This circle, the cross and the triangle.

212
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,830
They are symbols often used for unprintable words.

213
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:12,530
Is it possible that this could be someone's name?

214
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,430
I have a feeling that

215
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,230
I've seen those symbols somewhere before!

216
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,230
What?

217
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,830
What? What did you say?

218
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,530
Where did you see them?

219
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,330
Please remember, Ms. Jodie!

220
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,830
The controller!

221
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:34,830
Those symbols are on the Japanese PC game controller.

222
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:38,430
Did it help you at all?

223
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:42,430
Oh, yeah. I remember this teacher is a PC gamer.

224
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,030
Inspector Megure!

225
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,030
The victims cell phone log shows that someone called him

226
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,430
30 minutes ago.

227
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,430
What?

228
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,030
30 minutes ago!

229
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,130
That's about the time when he was killed!

230
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,330
So then why don't you return the call?

231
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,330
What?

232
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,930
Oh, yeah.

233
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,130
You are the one

234
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:22,830
who called Mr. Chujo 30 minutes ago, right?

235
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,930
Oh, no... I just...

236
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,330
Hey!

237
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,930
He might be the guy who was calling back then.

238
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:34,030
I heard this guy talking about something suspicious!

239
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,430
Let's see.

240
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,130
He said, I'll pay four times as much

241
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,830
so come here immediately or something like that.

242
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:43,030
Can you help me make sense of it?

243
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,330
I understand. I'll tell you everything!

244
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,630
I'll explain everything. I promise.

245
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,030
So your company hired a private detective

246
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,530
to conduct its own internal investigation.

247
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,930
That's right.

248
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,330
Last month, we discovered that

249
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,130
an employee has secretly been embezzling money

250
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,230
from our company.

251
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,130
So, an executive ordered me to find out

252
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,430
who it was before informing the president of the mess.

253
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,930
Where is your company?

254
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:16,230
Our company occupies the 8th to 11th floor of this building.

255
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,830
I see.

256
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,330
You got a call from the private detective

257
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,630
that he tracked down the embezzler.

258
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,230
So, you tried to avoid meeting him in your office

259
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,930
and arranged to meet him at this cafe.

260
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,430
But as he didn't show up

261
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,930
at the appointed time,

262
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,230
you called him, right?

263
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,630
Yes.

264
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:39,130
As the envelope Mr. Chujo was holding was empty,

265
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,130
I think the embezzler and the murderer

266
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,330
are the same person?

267
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,930
Yeah. It's quite possible that

268
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,630
the embezzler killed the private investigator

269
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,830
and then ran inside into one of the offices upstairs.

270
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:55,330
But, do you have any idea who the embezzler is?

271
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,630
Oh, no.

272
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,230
Last week, the private investigator

273
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,030
gave me an interim report that

274
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,430
included a list of suspicious employees.

275
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,130
Here is the list!

276
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,030
Inspector Megure!

277
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,930
Geez, it'll take a bit of doing to check them all.

278
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:19,830
There are 58 suspects.

279
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,730
The only clues so far

280
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,530
are the symbols, a circle, a cross and a triangle.

281
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,730
How intriguing.

282
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,030
Inspector Megure!

283
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,930
The fingerprints of Mr. Chujo,

284
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,530
who was stabbed to death,

285
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,230
were detected on the symbols written with blood.

286
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,330
Oh, I see!

287
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,330
As we expected, the blood was Mr. Chujo's

288
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,630
and it also hasn't been long since he wrote them.

289
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,730
So, there's almost no doubt

290
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:52,530
that he wrote the circle, cross and triangle,

291
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:58,430
as a clue or a dying message

292
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,130
to identity the murderer.

293
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,230
Good.

294
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:08,130
Also it seems that Mr. Chujo was stabbed

295
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,130
before the black out.

296
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,930
Before the blackout?

297
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:15,730
Yes. According to a witness,

298
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:20,830
the lights went out after a man in a coat stabbed Mr. Chujo.

299
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,530
The spot where he was stabbed is around here,

300
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,130
just in front of the escalator.

301
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:30,330
The blackout started while the two scrambled for his envelope.

302
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,630
When the lights came back on,

303
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,830
Mr. Chujo's body moved to the escalator

304
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,730
and was crouched there.

305
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,930
The man in the coat approached him,

306
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,730
pulled something like a document out of the envelope

307
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:45,130
and ran up the stairs!

308
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:50,530
So then, Mr. Chujo wrote the circle, cross and triangle here

309
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:53,530
around the bottom of the escalator.

310
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:56,830
Yes. He probably wrote them during the blackout.

311
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,530
You mean, Mr. Chujo tried to hold on tight to the envelope

312
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:03,130
in order to keep it from being stolen,

313
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:06,730
but the killer managed to get it after all.

314
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,330
So, he died in that position

315
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:12,630
and was brought to the top by the escalator.

316
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:17,730
But why didn't the witness scream right then and there?

317
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:22,330
The witness thought they were filming a suspense drama.

318
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,630
Anyway, it is almost certain that

319
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,530
the murderer is the embezzler!

320
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,530
So, all we have to do now is

321
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:33,630
figure out what the circle, cross and triangle means

322
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,430
and from this list of 58 suspects,

323
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,030
Find out which one it refers to.

324
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,530
Don't you think that the X on the envelope

325
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,230
represents the multiplication symbol?

326
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,630
And the circle, cross, and triangle

327
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:49,430
represent a mathematical formula?

328
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,330
But, why does it have to be a circle, cross and triangle?

329
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,630
If the equation is written,

330
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,530
the culprit could destroy the evidence,

331
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,530
so the culprit camouflaged it by using a circle, cross and triangle!

332
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,630
I see. So, the murderer must be a mathematician!

333
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:06,830
Is there an employee who excels at mathematics in your company?

334
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,430
No. We primarily focus on recruiting

335
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:13,930
those who are adept at different languages.

336
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,430
If it were triangle, circle and square,

337
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,030
it would look like Oden,

338
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:23,930
Hey, maybe the cross stands for that "X"?

339
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,530
You know. The cute "X" mark

340
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,230
that Ms. Jodie mentioned in class!

341
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,330
-What? -What?

342
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,230
No...

343
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,030
No... It's definitely not that X.

344
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,130
Do you mean the mark

345
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,530
the girls often put at the end of letters?

346
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,030
Oh, yes!

347
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,530
Officer Takagi!

348
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,830
Do you know the meaning of that X?

349
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,830
I see. So, you must often get those kinds of letters.

350
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,730
Well... No. Only on rare occasions.

351
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:02,530
So, what is the meaning of the X then?

352
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,430
It has absolutely nothing to do with

353
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,930
the circle, cross and triangle in this case.

354
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,030
Hey, maybe it's not just a circle, cross and triangle,

355
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,730
but another message!

356
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,430
What?

357
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,130
Look carefully and closely.

358
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,130
At the edge of the envelope on the left side of the circle mark.

359
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,530
There's a blood stain!

360
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,330
I think there was something else

361
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,330
besides the circle, cross and triangle.

362
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,830
Oh, we've already noticed it too.

363
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,330
But there was no matching trace of blood left anywhere.

364
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,230
Well, did you check the you-know-where too?

365
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,430
The steps of this escalator.

366
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,130
This escalator isn't running right now,

367
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,630
but when the body was found, it was moving.

368
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,130
So another character written with blood

369
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,830
must be hidden behind the escalator!

370
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,130
That makes sense.

371
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,430
But since the escalator was moving for quite some time,

372
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,530
don't you think the mark

373
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,230
might have been completely wiped out by now?

374
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,830
No problem!

375
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,730
The blood will emit light like magic

376
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,930
if a chemical called mineral or something

377
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,430
is sprayed on the spot!

378
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,930
Right, Officer Takagi?

379
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,430
Oh, yeah.

380
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:10,630
The luminol solution can detect traces of blood.

381
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:14,530
Since the victim wrote that while crouching,

382
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:17,530
it should be easy to tell which step it was

383
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:21,530
because it would emit light brighter than any other steps!

384
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,830
That's right.

385
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,630
And, just one more thing.

386
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,930
What is it?

387
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,130
What's the meaning of the X?

388
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,430
What?

389
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:34,830
You know, the one you guys talked about earlier.

390
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,530
I think it's a bit too early for a kid like you

391
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,130
to understand something like that yet.

392
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:42,030
Officer, could you check on this?

393
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,230
Inspector Megure! We've found a coat,

394
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,730
a hat and a pair of gloves that are probably the culprits.

395
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,830
I see.

396
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,630
Those belongings had been left in a bathroom

397
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,830
on the fifth floor that is rarely used,

398
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,630
but the document that had been stolen

399
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,030
from the victim weren't found there.

400
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:02,430
Then, have you checked the suspects alibis?

401
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,730
Yes, Sir! We split up and checked them out.

402
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,830
At the time of the incident,

403
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,130
many employees were either taking a nap

404
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,530
or out for supper alone.

405
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,330
So, we could confirm the alibis of

406
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,230
only 27 out of the 58 on the list.

407
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,730
Here are the names of the 31 people without alibis!

408
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,830
We're still searching for the stolen document,

409
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:27,230
concentrating heavily on the floors from 8 to 11,

410
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,230
but haven't found them yet.

411
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,530
Okay, then you continue to search for it!

412
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,930
Yes, Sir!

413
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:38,430
We've narrowed the list down to 31 suspects.

414
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,230
Yet, that circle, cross and triangle are the only clues we have.

415
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,930
Unless we find another character

416
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:46,630
from the step of the escalator...

417
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,630
Inspector, we've found another character written with blood!

418
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,630
What! What character is that?

419
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,730
Inspector, it's a...

420
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,830
What is this about?

421
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,730
A square?

422
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,930
It also looks like a Kanji character, mouth

423
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:03,630
or "ro" in the Katakana alphabet.

424
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,330
But judging from the previous circle, cross and triangle,

425
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,730
is most likely to be a square.

426
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,730
Well... I'm more confused than ever now.

427
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,930
As it's shape matches with the trace of blood on the envelope,

428
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,830
this was definitely written by Mr. Chujo.

429
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,830
Isn't that square...

430
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:27,930
a little bigger than the other circle, cross and triangle?

431
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,560
Next Conan Hint:

432
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,060
"Square"
