1
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:02,569
Bite!

2
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:05,969
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:07,069
A violent exotic species,

4
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:08,469
an annoying new inhabitant in the lake,

5
00:00:08,469 --> 00:00:10,269
and the unexpected connection of a man wanting to breed them.

6
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:11,669
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:13,169
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:15,369
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:07,234 --> 00:02:10,534
"Beika Central Park"

10
00:02:12,934 --> 00:02:14,634
What's up?

11
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,734
-Officer Takagi! -Officer Takagi!

12
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:17,334
Oh, it's you guys.

13
00:02:17,334 --> 00:02:18,634
Are you investigating a case?

14
00:02:18,634 --> 00:02:19,734
Yeah.

15
00:02:19,734 --> 00:02:22,334
At the Fukurokouji residence over there.

16
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:24,234
Late last night...

17
00:02:29,434 --> 00:02:30,434
Robber!

18
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:34,934
So he got away just like that.

19
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:37,634
The amount stolen was three million yen.

20
00:02:37,634 --> 00:02:40,834
The robber had gloves on, so we couldn't get any fingerprints.

21
00:02:40,834 --> 00:02:42,734
He also wore a mask, so we don't know what he looks like either.

22
00:02:42,734 --> 00:02:46,634
The only clue we have is that he is tall and skinny.

23
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:49,234
We're trying to get clues as to where he may have fled

24
00:02:49,234 --> 00:02:51,434
and are looking for witnesses.

25
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:54,034
I guess you won't be needing the Youth Detective Squad's help, then.

26
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:56,534
Yeah, a burglary is a case that should be handled by the police.

27
00:02:56,534 --> 00:03:00,634
-Yeah. -Let's hurry and go to Beika Central Park!

28
00:03:00,634 --> 00:03:02,534
At Beika Central Park, they're...

29
00:03:02,534 --> 00:03:03,834
They're working on that thing

30
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:06,334
that was reported to the city hall this morning.

31
00:03:10,934 --> 00:03:12,734
Please stand back! It's dangerous!

32
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,434
Stand back from the lake a little more!

33
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:15,434
Where is it? Is it really here?

34
00:03:15,434 --> 00:03:16,934
Don't push, Genta!

35
00:03:16,934 --> 00:03:18,734
Even you're afraid of it, Conan.

36
00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:19,934
There it is!

37
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:23,034
Over here, over here!

38
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:24,934
There, there!

39
00:03:24,934 --> 00:03:26,934
No doubt about it.

40
00:03:26,934 --> 00:03:29,534
That's an alligator snapping turtle.

41
00:03:29,534 --> 00:03:31,334
Alligator snapping turtle?

42
00:03:33,134 --> 00:03:38,934
"Lakeside Mystery"

43
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:42,934
I wonder if someone kept it as a pet?

44
00:03:42,934 --> 00:03:45,734
It's a turtle that didn't originally exist in Japan.

45
00:03:45,734 --> 00:03:47,034
So I think the owner secretly disposed of it

46
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:48,534
because the turtle was hard to keep.

47
00:03:48,534 --> 00:03:50,134
It is called the alligator snapping turtle

48
00:03:50,134 --> 00:03:53,034
and it lives mainly in North America and Mexico.

49
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:56,134
It has an aggressive character and strong jaws.

50
00:03:56,134 --> 00:03:59,134
It can easily bite off the finger of a human being.

51
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:02,834
No one should keep something so dangerous as pets.

52
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:06,334
In this world, to each is his own.

53
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:08,634
There are people who fill empty spaces in their hearts

54
00:04:08,634 --> 00:04:11,734
by keeping things like them as pets.

55
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:13,734
What a lonely person.

56
00:04:13,734 --> 00:04:16,634
I wonder if there are people who aren't lonely?

57
00:04:16,634 --> 00:04:19,434
I wonder if that's the reason why reptiles are popular now?

58
00:04:19,434 --> 00:04:21,934
Well, I don't really like reptiles.

59
00:04:21,934 --> 00:04:25,034
But it's not that I don't understand how people that raise them feel.

60
00:04:25,034 --> 00:04:26,734
Everyone is free to keep what they want.

61
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:28,834
But to dispose of the animal is too irresponsible.

62
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:29,934
That's right.

63
00:04:29,934 --> 00:04:33,734
Yeah, letting an animal that doesn't originally exist in Japan go free,

64
00:04:33,734 --> 00:04:35,934
could throw the original ecosystem off balance.

65
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:37,334
So it is an unforgivable action.

66
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:39,634
Isn't it good that there's more of these animals?

67
00:04:39,634 --> 00:04:42,334
No, that's not the point.

68
00:04:42,334 --> 00:04:44,434
But we can't just leave the alligator snapping turtle here!

69
00:04:44,434 --> 00:04:46,734
Let's go and track down the person

70
00:04:46,734 --> 00:04:48,234
who disposed of such an dangerous animal!

71
00:04:48,234 --> 00:04:49,834
-Yeah. -That's right.

72
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:52,134
It's the mission of the Youth Detective Squad!

73
00:04:52,134 --> 00:04:53,834
But how?

74
00:04:55,134 --> 00:04:58,034
Always fighting for justice, the Youth Detective Squad.

75
00:04:58,034 --> 00:04:59,434
Huh?

76
00:05:06,234 --> 00:05:08,034
Let's do this, then.

77
00:05:08,034 --> 00:05:09,334
I'm sure we'll be able to track down the owner,

78
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:12,834
if we check the pet shops one after the other.

79
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:14,834
Since the alligator snapping turtle have a big appetite,

80
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:17,434
the owner must've frequently go to the pet shop

81
00:05:17,434 --> 00:05:19,834
to buy feed such as little fish or crawfish.

82
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:21,334
Did I hit the bull's eye?

83
00:05:21,334 --> 00:05:23,634
I see. Let's do that.

84
00:05:23,634 --> 00:05:25,634
You're smart.

85
00:05:25,634 --> 00:05:27,434
What's the matter, Conan?

86
00:05:30,934 --> 00:05:34,134
You're the one who got rid of the alligator snapping turtle, right?

87
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:44,934
I finally have a boyfriend.

88
00:05:44,934 --> 00:05:46,034
But...

89
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:53,334
He didn't like reptiles, right?

90
00:05:53,334 --> 00:05:54,634
Yes.

91
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:57,534
After that, things just got complicated.

92
00:05:57,534 --> 00:05:59,434
But it's good

93
00:05:59,434 --> 00:06:02,334
that you found someone to fill the empty space in your heart, isn't it?

94
00:06:02,334 --> 00:06:05,134
But no matter what the reason,

95
00:06:05,134 --> 00:06:06,634
disposing of an animal is...

96
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:08,434
Huh? Haibara?

97
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:11,534
I just remembered that there's something I have to do, so count me out.

98
00:06:16,734 --> 00:06:18,034
Where is it?

99
00:06:18,034 --> 00:06:20,034
-It got away! -No doubt about it.

100
00:06:20,034 --> 00:06:22,534
He's my pet turtle, Kamejiro.

101
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:25,734
Are you the owner of that alligator snapping turtle?

102
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:27,134
Excuse me.

103
00:06:27,134 --> 00:06:28,834
My name is Nihonmatsu.

104
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:31,534
I live in an apartment on 3-chome.

105
00:06:31,534 --> 00:06:34,934
Yesterday, when I took my eyes off him for a moment, he fled.

106
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:37,734
I had no idea he would come this far.

107
00:06:37,734 --> 00:06:40,234
Please catch him as soon as possible

108
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,834
and return him back to me.

109
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:44,634
Just what is that man talking about?

110
00:06:44,634 --> 00:06:46,134
That turtle is mine.

111
00:06:47,734 --> 00:06:50,534
A turtle with more than one owner.

112
00:06:50,534 --> 00:06:52,634
Very interesting.

113
00:06:52,634 --> 00:06:54,634
Hey, hey.

114
00:06:54,634 --> 00:06:57,934
Is that turtle really yours?

115
00:06:57,934 --> 00:06:59,434
I couldn't possibly made a mistake.

116
00:06:59,434 --> 00:07:01,134
After all, it's such a rare turtle.

117
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:02,234
But it's strange.

118
00:07:02,234 --> 00:07:05,134
That lady over there is saying that she left the turtle here yesterday.

119
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:07,334
Huh?

120
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:15,334
I didn't think the real owner would appear.

121
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,934
Why'd you say it was your turtle?

122
00:07:17,934 --> 00:07:19,934
Well, you see, the reason is...

123
00:07:19,934 --> 00:07:21,734
I want to atone my wrongdoings.

124
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:23,334
Atone your wrongdoings?

125
00:07:23,334 --> 00:07:27,234
I bought a red-eared slider at a fair when I was a child.

126
00:07:27,234 --> 00:07:31,134
But I gradually got tired of taking care of it everyday.

127
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:34,134
I eventually disposed of it in a nearby swamp.

128
00:07:34,134 --> 00:07:36,234
But I regretted what I did all these years.

129
00:07:36,234 --> 00:07:39,634
And when I heard that a alligator snapping turtle was found by this lake,

130
00:07:39,634 --> 00:07:42,434
I was sure that someone left it.

131
00:07:42,434 --> 00:07:46,034
The turtle isn't to blame, so I felt sorry for it.

132
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:49,734
That's why I was thinking of taking the turtle home with me and keep it.

133
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:52,334
I want to make up for abandoning my red-eared slider away in the past.

134
00:07:52,334 --> 00:07:53,934
Is that right?

135
00:07:53,934 --> 00:07:55,334
Such a good person.

136
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:58,434
Please give your turtle to me, Ms. Kimata.

137
00:07:58,434 --> 00:08:00,234
I will take good care of it.

138
00:08:00,234 --> 00:08:01,234
Please consider it.

139
00:08:02,934 --> 00:08:06,634
Of course. I'd like you to do just that.

140
00:08:06,634 --> 00:08:09,434
Please keep it for me.

141
00:08:09,434 --> 00:08:10,434
Thank you.

142
00:08:10,434 --> 00:08:11,934
Of course. Of course.

143
00:08:15,334 --> 00:08:17,934
How lucky, Mr. Nihonmatsu.

144
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:21,734
There couldn't have been a happier ending for the turtle, too.

145
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,734
It really found the best possible owner. Right, Conan?

146
00:08:24,734 --> 00:08:26,134
Well, yeah...

147
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:31,134
-Maybe they... -Maybe they...

148
00:08:31,134 --> 00:08:33,134
I'm sorry, excuse me.

149
00:08:33,134 --> 00:08:34,434
You got the turtle!

150
00:08:35,534 --> 00:08:37,534
No, that's not it.

151
00:08:37,534 --> 00:08:38,634
Look.

152
00:08:44,634 --> 00:08:45,934
There are...

153
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:47,434
Alligator snapping turtle?

154
00:08:47,434 --> 00:08:48,734
There's one on this side, too!

155
00:08:48,734 --> 00:08:50,034
There's another one on this side, too!

156
00:08:52,534 --> 00:08:55,834
Which means there are...

157
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:57,734
Four in total?

158
00:08:57,734 --> 00:09:00,634
What's with this lake?

159
00:09:00,634 --> 00:09:03,834
Mr. Nihonmatsu, which one is your turtle?

160
00:09:05,434 --> 00:09:06,634
Well...

161
00:09:06,634 --> 00:09:08,034
It's okay.

162
00:09:08,034 --> 00:09:12,334
Let me take all the alligator snapping turtles in this lake home with me.

163
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:13,434
All of them?

164
00:09:13,434 --> 00:09:15,034
What?

165
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:17,934
Well, all the turtles have been abandoned.

166
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:19,334
I feel sorry for them.

167
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:21,434
Mr. Nihonmatsu.

168
00:09:21,434 --> 00:09:24,334
You're really a kind person, aren't you?

169
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:26,534
There's no need to cry.

170
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:29,234
Huh? That finger.

171
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:30,534
What happened?

172
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:32,534
Well, this really is nothing.

173
00:09:34,534 --> 00:09:35,534
All right!

174
00:09:36,934 --> 00:09:38,634
Caught the first one!

175
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:53,234
Be careful. That's how they are.

176
00:09:53,234 --> 00:09:56,634
He bites at you suddenly like that.

177
00:09:56,634 --> 00:09:58,334
How scary.

178
00:09:58,334 --> 00:10:01,734
But the more you look at it, the cuter it looks.

179
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:04,434
I love turtles after all.

180
00:10:04,434 --> 00:10:08,134
That's probably because you used to keep a red-eared slider before.

181
00:10:08,134 --> 00:10:10,534
Yeah, that's probably why.

182
00:10:10,534 --> 00:10:13,234
That turtle was cute and beautiful, too.

183
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:16,934
The shell would get greener and more vivid as it grows.

184
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,634
This man...

185
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:23,934
What?

186
00:10:23,934 --> 00:10:25,434
You mean, that man?

187
00:10:25,434 --> 00:10:28,034
What about him that you can't believe, Conan?

188
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:29,334
Everything.

189
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:33,534
For example, the red-eared slider

190
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:37,234
has a vivid green shell only when it's young.

191
00:10:37,234 --> 00:10:40,234
The shell gets darker as it grows.

192
00:10:40,234 --> 00:10:41,434
It was beautiful, too.

193
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:45,034
The shell would get greener and more vivid as it grows.

194
00:10:45,034 --> 00:10:46,934
It's just not possible.

195
00:10:46,934 --> 00:10:49,434
If he really kept a turtle, that's something he should know.

196
00:10:49,434 --> 00:10:51,534
Which means that he lied?

197
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:53,434
He lied about throwing the turtle away in the swamp, too?

198
00:10:53,434 --> 00:10:54,534
That's right.

199
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:57,634
The story about him wanting to make up to the turtle is a lie, too.

200
00:10:57,634 --> 00:10:58,934
I may as well add

201
00:10:58,934 --> 00:11:01,634
that he doesn't think turtles are cute at all.

202
00:11:01,634 --> 00:11:04,134
On the other hand, it seems as if he has a grudge against turtles.

203
00:11:04,134 --> 00:11:05,134
That's how they are.

204
00:11:05,134 --> 00:11:07,634
He bites at you suddenly like that.

205
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,234
Everything's a lie.

206
00:11:09,234 --> 00:11:13,734
Then why does he want to take all of the turtles with him?

207
00:11:13,734 --> 00:11:17,234
Is he going to be taken to the castle under the sea for having saved them?

208
00:11:17,234 --> 00:11:18,234
Hey, hey.

209
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:20,334
I got it.

210
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:22,234
I know what Mr. Nihonmatsu is up to.

211
00:11:22,234 --> 00:11:24,534
I'll unmask his real character.

212
00:11:24,534 --> 00:11:25,634
Mitsuhiko!

213
00:11:25,634 --> 00:11:27,434
Genta, will you keep an eye on that man?

214
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:28,934
-Conan! -Conan!

215
00:11:28,934 --> 00:11:30,534
What kind of person he is?

216
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:32,134
He doesn't seem like a bad person,

217
00:11:32,134 --> 00:11:36,334
but debt collectors come to see him everyday and he hasn't pay his rent.

218
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:39,434
As far as I'm concerned, he's a troublesome tenant.

219
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:41,734
He seems to be having financial problems.

220
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,734
It's hard to think he has enough money to keep those turtles.

221
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:46,534
A lot of money will be needed.

222
00:11:46,534 --> 00:11:49,934
Maybe he don't intend to keep, but to sell them off and make money?

223
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:54,334
No, the normal range for the turtle is 4,000 yen to 8,000 yen each.

224
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:57,634
Even if he sell all four turtles, he wouldn't be able to pay rent.

225
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,534
It's not to sell them, then.

226
00:11:59,534 --> 00:12:01,634
He must have a different reason for wanting to have them.

227
00:12:04,034 --> 00:12:05,734
We've caught the second one!

228
00:12:06,634 --> 00:12:09,234
But if you plan on keeping all four,

229
00:12:09,234 --> 00:12:10,634
what about an aquarium for them?

230
00:12:10,634 --> 00:12:14,134
That's right. I'll have to get one ready right away.

231
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:16,434
Please contact me after you have caught all four of them.

232
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:17,634
I'll come back again.

233
00:12:20,734 --> 00:12:22,634
So far everything is going well.

234
00:12:22,634 --> 00:12:25,634
But I thought there was going to be only one turtle.

235
00:12:25,634 --> 00:12:27,534
Turns out that there's four of them.

236
00:12:28,734 --> 00:12:30,234
He's sighing.

237
00:12:30,234 --> 00:12:36,334
It seems like he only wanted one alligator snapping turtle of the four.

238
00:12:36,334 --> 00:12:39,034
But he doesn't seem to know which turtle is the one he wants.

239
00:12:39,034 --> 00:12:42,934
That's why he had no choice but to take all of the turtles.

240
00:12:42,934 --> 00:12:45,534
He just wants one turtle out of the four?

241
00:12:45,534 --> 00:12:47,234
I'm sure that there's something special

242
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:50,334
about that one turtle that he wants.

243
00:12:54,134 --> 00:12:55,134
I know.

244
00:12:55,134 --> 00:12:57,134
It's one million yen including the interest and all, right?

245
00:12:57,134 --> 00:12:58,734
I've already got the money.

246
00:12:58,734 --> 00:13:01,134
It's just that I can't get a hold of it yet.

247
00:13:01,134 --> 00:13:02,234
One million?

248
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:05,934
I'll be able to give you back the money either today or tomorrow.

249
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:09,734
I hope you know what's going to happen if you don't keep your word.

250
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:14,834
I wish they would catch the turtles quick.

251
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:17,034
What did he mean by that just now?

252
00:13:17,034 --> 00:13:19,534
I guess it means that he'll be able to pay his debts back

253
00:13:19,534 --> 00:13:22,334
if he gets the alligator snapping turtle that he's after.

254
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,434
How does that turtle connect with one million yen?

255
00:13:25,434 --> 00:13:26,934
I got it!

256
00:13:26,934 --> 00:13:30,034
Maybe there's some kind of map on the shell of the turtle?

257
00:13:30,034 --> 00:13:32,534
Like the place that gold and diamonds are hidden?

258
00:13:32,534 --> 00:13:34,534
Hey, Genta.

259
00:13:34,534 --> 00:13:38,134
Who, when and for what reason would someone draw a map like that?

260
00:13:38,134 --> 00:13:40,234
Well, you see...

261
00:13:41,434 --> 00:13:45,134
Let me help you, granny.

262
00:13:45,134 --> 00:13:47,334
Genta ran off just in the nick of time.

263
00:13:47,334 --> 00:13:49,134
We've caught the third one!

264
00:13:50,734 --> 00:13:52,234
Just one more to go.

265
00:13:52,234 --> 00:13:54,334
Alligator snapping turtle and one million yen...

266
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:00,834
What is it?

267
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:02,134
Maybe this is...

268
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,534
Remember what Officer Takagi was saying this morning?

269
00:14:06,534 --> 00:14:10,534
The robber last night had gloves and a mask on.

270
00:14:10,534 --> 00:14:12,134
I'll go look for Officer Takagi!

271
00:14:12,134 --> 00:14:16,034
-Ayumi! -It's not confirmed that these are the robber's, though.

272
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:18,234
But as far as the time is concerned, it matches.

273
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:21,834
Although it rained a bit last night, this isn't wet.

274
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:24,534
Which means that these were burnt after it stopped raining.

275
00:14:24,534 --> 00:14:27,134
That's between late last night to early this morning.

276
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:28,134
I see.

277
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:32,834
That means, it's possible that these belong to the robber last night?

278
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:35,534
After stealing three million yen from a certain house,

279
00:14:35,534 --> 00:14:37,534
he ran in here.

280
00:14:37,534 --> 00:14:39,734
And he got rid of the things he used.

281
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:52,034
Maybe the two cases are connected in some way.

282
00:14:52,034 --> 00:14:53,634
The two cases?

283
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:55,534
Last night's robbery

284
00:14:55,534 --> 00:14:59,934
and Mr. Nihonmatsu wanting to get hold of the turtles in the lake.

285
00:14:59,934 --> 00:15:01,134
-What? -What?

286
00:15:05,718 --> 00:15:06,718
What?

287
00:15:06,718 --> 00:15:09,418
Are you saying that the man called Nihonmatsu

288
00:15:09,418 --> 00:15:11,518
is the one who robbed the house last night?

289
00:15:11,518 --> 00:15:15,118
Yeah. You said that the robber was tall and skinny, right?

290
00:15:15,118 --> 00:15:16,618
Well, I did.

291
00:15:16,618 --> 00:15:19,218
He's tall and skinny, too.

292
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,018
Besides, he said...

293
00:15:22,418 --> 00:15:25,118
I'll be able to give you back the money either today or tomorrow.

294
00:15:25,118 --> 00:15:27,718
Furthermore, there's a bandage around his finger.

295
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,218
He probably wounded his finger

296
00:15:29,218 --> 00:15:32,118
when he tried to get rid of the evidence here.

297
00:15:32,118 --> 00:15:33,118
That's how they are.

298
00:15:33,118 --> 00:15:35,618
He bites at you suddenly like that.

299
00:15:35,618 --> 00:15:38,618
I think he was bitten by the alligator snapping turtle.

300
00:15:40,918 --> 00:15:43,718
But there's one thing that I still can't figure out.

301
00:15:43,718 --> 00:15:44,718
I get it.

302
00:15:44,718 --> 00:15:48,618
You can't figure out why he wants to take the turtles home with him, right?

303
00:15:48,618 --> 00:15:50,518
-I've figured it out! -What?

304
00:15:50,518 --> 00:15:55,918
Listen. Last night, he stole the money and fled here.

305
00:16:00,718 --> 00:16:02,318
He took off his mask

306
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:03,918
and gloves

307
00:16:03,918 --> 00:16:06,218
because he wanted to burn the evidence here.

308
00:16:06,218 --> 00:16:07,518
But just then...

309
00:16:13,718 --> 00:16:17,718
The alligator snapping turtle that bit his finger saw his face.

310
00:16:23,018 --> 00:16:26,118
But it turned out that there were four alligator snapping turtles here.

311
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,618
He couldn't tell which turtle saw him, so he...

312
00:16:27,618 --> 00:16:30,318
Conan, if he's the robber,

313
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:32,718
he should already have gotten hold of the three million yen.

314
00:16:32,718 --> 00:16:34,718
Yet, why is it that he still can't pay back his debts?

315
00:16:34,718 --> 00:16:36,618
Yeah, that's the question.

316
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:39,718
This is the fourth and last one!

317
00:16:43,718 --> 00:16:45,218
Hey, wait for me!

318
00:16:46,418 --> 00:16:49,918
You want to find the guy from this morning who told us about the turtles?

319
00:16:51,518 --> 00:16:55,518
He didn't say his name but he sounded young.

320
00:16:57,718 --> 00:16:59,118
It's probably him.

321
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:02,618
He asked the City Hall to do it since he couldn't catch the turtle himself.

322
00:17:02,618 --> 00:17:05,418
But why does he need the alligator snapping turtle so badly?

323
00:17:06,918 --> 00:17:08,818
I've already got the money.

324
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:11,318
It's just that I can't get a hold of it yet.

325
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:14,518
So why can't he get a hold of the money?

326
00:17:14,518 --> 00:17:18,318
Last night, one of these turtles bit that person's finger.

327
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:20,818
But that doesn't explain everything.

328
00:17:21,818 --> 00:17:24,118
It's so big! Anything would fit into it.

329
00:17:24,118 --> 00:17:26,018
Be careful, Shu. It's dangerous!

330
00:17:26,018 --> 00:17:27,118
Come on, let's go home.

331
00:17:29,118 --> 00:17:30,218
Could it be that...

332
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:34,218
But it's not impossible.

333
00:17:34,218 --> 00:17:39,018
Hey, I think you should check these alligator snapping turtles right away.

334
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:41,318
What would we be looking for?

335
00:17:52,518 --> 00:17:53,818
Just as I thought.

336
00:17:56,318 --> 00:17:59,018
What? You won't let me have them?

337
00:17:59,018 --> 00:18:01,718
No, that's not it.

338
00:18:01,718 --> 00:18:04,418
It'll take a week for the papers to process.

339
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:05,818
That long?

340
00:18:09,018 --> 00:18:10,918
I have to wait for a week?

341
00:18:10,918 --> 00:18:12,918
What a bummer.

342
00:18:12,918 --> 00:18:13,918
That's right.

343
00:18:16,018 --> 00:18:17,418
He's started moving.

344
00:18:20,918 --> 00:18:22,018
Let's see...

345
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,118
I'm sure it was 304, 304.

346
00:18:24,118 --> 00:18:25,118
Here it is.

347
00:18:27,118 --> 00:18:28,118
What's wrong?

348
00:18:28,118 --> 00:18:29,418
That's weird.

349
00:18:29,418 --> 00:18:31,518
No use to keep trying.

350
00:18:31,518 --> 00:18:34,418
You want to pay a one week rental fee, right?

351
00:18:35,418 --> 00:18:37,418
Because if you leave it inside for more than three days,

352
00:18:37,418 --> 00:18:42,018
the management will deem that something is wrong and retrieve it.

353
00:18:42,018 --> 00:18:43,818
No, well, that's...

354
00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:46,518
Unfortunately, coin lockers are made

355
00:18:46,518 --> 00:18:51,318
so that unless you insert the key, you can't insert money.

356
00:18:51,318 --> 00:18:52,918
That's right.

357
00:18:52,918 --> 00:18:55,518
I'm going to open that locker.

358
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:57,018
The police?

359
00:19:10,718 --> 00:19:15,318
Mr. Nihonmatsu, can you explain why the money's here?

360
00:19:15,318 --> 00:19:16,718
Darn it.

361
00:19:16,718 --> 00:19:19,418
Since you were in debt and troubled,

362
00:19:19,418 --> 00:19:21,518
you broke into the Fukurokouji residence last night

363
00:19:21,518 --> 00:19:24,718
and succeeded in getting away with three million yen, right?

364
00:19:24,718 --> 00:19:28,618
But putting the money in the locker was a mistake.

365
00:19:28,618 --> 00:19:32,018
I thought I was lucky back then.

366
00:19:34,018 --> 00:19:35,818
I am exhausted...

367
00:19:35,818 --> 00:19:38,018
Are you okay, mister?

368
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:39,518
Let's find a place to rest before we continue.

369
00:19:39,518 --> 00:19:41,918
No, I can't afford being questioned.

370
00:19:41,918 --> 00:19:42,918
Are you all right?

371
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:46,818
Talk about lucky!

372
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:54,018
Oh, no. I've got to hide this, too.

373
00:19:55,018 --> 00:19:57,518
Minami, Megumi...

374
00:19:57,518 --> 00:20:00,718
But I was out of 100 yen coins.

375
00:20:00,718 --> 00:20:04,418
You got rid of the evidence in the empty park

376
00:20:04,418 --> 00:20:07,318
and you planned to come back here in the morning to retrieve the money.

377
00:20:07,318 --> 00:20:09,718
So you thought everything worked out fine.

378
00:20:09,718 --> 00:20:12,718
But just then, something unexpected happened.

379
00:20:23,818 --> 00:20:25,518
No way!

380
00:20:25,518 --> 00:20:27,318
Why did you do that?

381
00:20:27,318 --> 00:20:28,718
Hey, spit it out.

382
00:20:28,718 --> 00:20:30,618
Spit that key out!

383
00:20:32,218 --> 00:20:33,418
Why you...

384
00:20:39,618 --> 00:20:41,018
No.

385
00:20:42,318 --> 00:20:43,718
So that's what happened.

386
00:20:43,718 --> 00:20:46,718
The turtle swallowed his precious key.

387
00:20:46,718 --> 00:20:49,918
I couldn't believe such a thing was possible,

388
00:20:49,918 --> 00:20:52,418
but these are the results of the X-Ray.

389
00:20:54,518 --> 00:20:56,418
Then he reported the turtle to the police

390
00:20:56,418 --> 00:20:58,718
and decided to have them catch it for him.

391
00:20:58,718 --> 00:21:02,118
He did that so he could get the key out of the turtle's stomach.

392
00:21:02,118 --> 00:21:05,018
But why'd he have to do something so troublesome?

393
00:21:05,018 --> 00:21:06,718
All he had to do was go to the management

394
00:21:06,718 --> 00:21:10,018
and have them open the locker for him, right?

395
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,518
No way!

396
00:21:11,518 --> 00:21:13,318
He could have them open it if he did so,

397
00:21:13,318 --> 00:21:17,418
but they'd check to make sure the stuff in the locker belonged to him.

398
00:21:17,418 --> 00:21:20,018
If they find three million yen in the bag,

399
00:21:20,018 --> 00:21:22,818
they'd be able to link it to the robbery from last night.

400
00:21:22,818 --> 00:21:24,118
I see.

401
00:21:24,118 --> 00:21:27,618
That's why he had no choice but to get hold of the turtles.

402
00:21:28,718 --> 00:21:30,518
-He's running away! -He's running away!

403
00:21:30,518 --> 00:21:32,018
I won't let you get away!

404
00:21:37,218 --> 00:21:38,518
Take that!

405
00:21:48,018 --> 00:21:49,318
Gosh.

406
00:21:49,318 --> 00:21:51,018
I tell you.

407
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,618
You shouldn't dispose something that dangerous in the lake of a park.

408
00:21:53,618 --> 00:21:55,018
Absolutely.

409
00:21:55,018 --> 00:21:58,818
But you have no right to criticize the person who did that.

410
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:02,718
You broke into a person's house last night and stole three million yen.

411
00:22:02,718 --> 00:22:04,018
I'm arresting you as a suspect.

412
00:23:32,018 --> 00:23:34,318
That's good, isn't it?

413
00:23:34,318 --> 00:23:36,818
All four turtles have found someone to keep them.

414
00:23:36,818 --> 00:23:39,218
Although they are dangerous creatures,

415
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:40,918
it'd be pretty cruel to abandon them.

416
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:42,818
Hey!

417
00:23:42,818 --> 00:23:43,918
Big news!

418
00:23:43,918 --> 00:23:47,118
This time, they're saying that a crane appeared up ahead!

419
00:23:47,118 --> 00:23:49,018
And it's not just one crane!

420
00:23:49,018 --> 00:23:52,018
-Let's go! -Hey, we'll be late!

421
00:23:54,118 --> 00:23:56,218
After turtles, now it's cranes.

422
00:23:57,418 --> 00:23:58,518
That's just great.

423
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:48,318
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:24:48,318 --> 00:24:51,218
"An illustration of the warning letter"

425
00:24:51,218 --> 00:24:52,518
That thieving Thief Kid makes a showy appearance in April,

426
00:24:52,518 --> 00:24:54,218
the start of the new semester.

427
00:24:54,218 --> 00:24:55,918
How devilishly thrilling.
