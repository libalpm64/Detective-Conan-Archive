1
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,590
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,690
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:11,090
Three cute doggies and four fishy breeders.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,790
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,690
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,590
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,400
"The Nonvanishing Evidence (Part 1)"

8
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,850
How cute!

9
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,350
He's a male Shiba Dog.

10
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,450
What's his name?

11
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,950
"Teruya Kanou (26)" -Arthur!

12
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,650
We named him after Arthur Conan Doyle,

13
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,950
the creator the renowned detective, Sherlock Holmes.

14
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,350
If he joins up with Conan,

15
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,750
it'll be the start of the world's greatest detective agency, right?

16
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,350
Hey, you want me to join up with a dog?

17
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,850
Sounds good! It's a very cute girlish concept.

18
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,150
You're too picky.

19
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,850
All right, all right.

20
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,450
Well, it's been 10 year

21
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,150
since I've been here and this town has really changed.

22
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,950
Did you find the new parking lot?

23
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,550
That area resembles a we-like pattern and is very complicated.

24
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,450
Ai navigated me using the map so I didn't get lost.

25
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,750
Hey, Arthur. Stop it, will you?

26
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,450
Strange, he rarely gets excited and barks like this.

27
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,650
Hey, Doctor.

28
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,650
Huh?

29
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,450
Did you touch a dog before you came here?

30
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,250
Moreover, a male dog that is larger than this Shiba dog.

31
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,750
Yes, together with Ai.

32
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,350
I saw a Doberman that a friend brought along with him this morning.

33
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,450
But, why?

34
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,050
You had dog hair on your slacks.

35
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,850
Dogs are able to tell the size and sex of another dog by smell.

36
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,250
Among male dogs,

37
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,950
when they find that there is another dog bigger than themselves,

38
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,550
a sense of enmity is aroused at times.

39
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,850
Besides, you and Ai came over to this gate once,

40
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,150
and were told by Mr. Kanou to go park your car again,

41
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,450
and then came back, right?

42
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,650
Therefore,

43
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,450
Arthur got the impression that you and Haibara are his owner's enemy,

44
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,750
because despite being shooed away once,

45
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,950
you came back again.

46
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,850
Oh, I see.

47
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,950
You're not too bright, are you?

48
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,950
You seem to resemble Conan

49
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,650
when it comes to being slightly absentminded, don't you?

50
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,350
Hey, hey.

51
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,550
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

52
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,650
Because his mistaken impression

53
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,950
is due to his natural behavior as a dog.

54
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,850
Dangerous people who are not of his kind.

55
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,850
In my case,

56
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,150
maybe he's not all that mistaken.

57
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,450
Hey, Haibara...

58
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,950
Just kidding.

59
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,250
You know...

60
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,550
And one more thing.

61
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,150
There is one other reason why Arthur barks.

62
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,950
It's your voice when you hold Arthur down.

63
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,750
"Yoshio Tsunashima (45)" -You're too soft.

64
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,150
When you scold him, you've got to be stern.

65
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:47,150
Otherwise, the dog will think you, the master is cheering him on.

66
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,650
So, keep that it mind, will you?

67
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,750
Yes, sir.

68
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,350
Who is he?

69
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,650
He is Mr. Tsunashima who I met at the Dog Lovers Club.

70
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,250
He's here for the same reason as you are, Dr. Agasa.

71
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,250
How nice!

72
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,150
So cool!

73
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,350
This plane is mine!

74
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,250
This doll is for me!

75
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,850
This antique hour-glass is for me, then.

76
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,250
But are you sure you don't mind?

77
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,150
They look so expensive.

78
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,250
Of course, not.

79
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,250
Those are just objects that my grandfather bought

80
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,050
and collected as a pastime while traveling abroad.

81
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,350
Although all three of us in the family have no interest in antiques,

82
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,850
we wouldn't feel right selling his things off either.

83
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,750
Therefore, both my parents decided

84
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,450
to give them away to our acquaintances.

85
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,750
Come to think of it, where are they?

86
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,450
They've both gone over to the new house,

87
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,750
that was just built and are getting ready to move,

88
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,250
so they're not here.

89
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,450
I'm going to be moving to England because of work,

90
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,150
so my parents are going to move to the country

91
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,550
where my father's younger brother lives.

92
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,450
That's why I'm trying to clear

93
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,050
all kinds of things out of this house.

94
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,150
The only thing I'm going to take with me to England is Arthur.

95
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,550
All that my parents will be taking with them is

96
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,450
my mother's dear dog, Doyle.

97
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,950
It's a Papillon!

98
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,850
If there's Arthur and Doyle,

99
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,850
there must be a dog named Conan, too?

100
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:13,050
My father had a dog named Conan,

101
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,750
but it died due to an illness two years ago.

102
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,350
Oh, I see.

103
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,750
But it's okay.

104
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,450
Because we have Conan with us.

105
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:23,050
Just what do you mean, Ayumi?

106
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,450
But the name Papillon is sure a funny name.

107
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,850
Papillon means butterfly in French.

108
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,050
They were really hailed

109
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,950
by the Imperial Court of France in the 16th Century.

110
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:38,150
It is said that Marie Antoinette also owned a pet Papillon.

111
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,950
What a fine coat of fur indeed!

112
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:47,150
It's no surprise that he was awarded the championship award.

113
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,450
Championship award?

114
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,550
He just happened to win the award at the contest my mother entered in.

115
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,150
Well, this dog is fine dog indeed

116
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,750
that there's people asking to buy him for a million yen.

117
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,550
A million yen?

118
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,750
Really, what a gracious and refined dog he is.

119
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,650
He is so much like the spoiled, selfish

120
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,050
and beheaded Queen of France.

121
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,750
Ms. Tosabayashi.

122
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,550
"Aki Tosabayashi (39)" -The front door was open,

123
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,250
so I took the liberty of letting myself in.

124
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:19,550
Because you mother told me that she'd give me anything I want.

125
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,850
As for this living room,

126
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,650
the only thing that I'm interested in is that large flower vase.

127
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,350
You people can go help yourselves for all I care.

128
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,450
No offense, but I'm going to hunt around on my own.

129
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,650
Is she a member of your dog lovers club, too?

130
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,750
Yes.

131
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,350
She wasn't like that before, though.

132
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:41,850
She's just all sulky because her dog lost to Doyle at the contest.

133
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,650
Oh, no.

134
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,250
I can't have that lady claiming the clock in the Japanese room

135
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,350
that I reserved for myself.

136
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,650
I'll have to stick a note on that clock

137
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,050
noting that it's already reserved.

138
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,750
Why don't you get yourself something too, Haibara?

139
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,050
We should take this opportunity to go help ourselves.

140
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,250
There are a lot of interesting things here.

141
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,150
I guess so.

142
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,750
Maybe I should take Doyle.

143
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,850
Huh?

144
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,150
Because if I am put to the guillotine

145
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,050
and disappear as mist like Marie,

146
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,050
don't you think this dog will come after me

147
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,950
and jump into the Seine River

148
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:20,150
as did her dog Thisbe, right?

149
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,850
Right?

150
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,750
Hey, come on.

151
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,950
She sure is quite an odd girl, isn't she?

152
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,750
Yes, sort of...

153
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,550
Hey, Shinichi. Can't you cheer her up a bit?

154
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,050
I really had a hard time bringing Ai

155
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:38,950
who refused leave the house after that bus incident, you know.

156
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,350
Strange.

157
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,450
After the incident,

158
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,650
I called her on the phone and told her not to worry

159
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,250
since no suspicious or unidentified people came up

160
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,850
during police interrogation.

161
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,350
But the way she's freaked out is not normal.

162
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,650
She even refuses to eat.

163
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,350
She doesn't seem to be sleeping much at night either.

164
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,650
The only thing I can say for sure now is that

165
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,250
even if there were any men on that bus

166
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,150
who were members of the Black Organization,

167
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,350
it was mere coincidence.

168
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,250
And not because they knew of her existence.

169
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,650
Besides, it's been 10 days since the incident.

170
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,750
If it weren't a coincidence, we would've been killed by now.

171
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,150
Including you and them too, because you were all there.

172
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,250
-Because... -It might be good.

173
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,450
Hey, not again.

174
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,750
Dr. Agasa, if you find something you want,

175
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,450
please feel free to take it too.

176
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,250
Oh, I guess so.

177
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,850
Let's see.

178
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:44,350
Then, I guess I'll take this stereo.

179
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,550
Oh, I'm sorry.

180
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,150
Somebody has already reserved that.

181
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,350
Huh?

182
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,650
Arthur.

183
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,650
No, you can't come in with dirty feet like that.

184
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,050
Hey!

185
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,150
What is it, Arthur?

186
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,250
Hey! All right.

187
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,150
I get the message, so let go of me, Arthur.

188
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,450
What is it?

189
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,050
I'm sorry.

190
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,250
I pushed the door bell many times,

191
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,050
but it seems to be broken.

192
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,150
"Shino Hasuki (27)" -Arthur was nice enough to go and get you,

193
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,550
so please don't scold him.

194
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,650
Oh, no.

195
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,850
I'm very sorry for not knowing you had come.

196
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,850
Go on, and play with Arthur.

197
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,850
They really get along, don't they?

198
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,750
A Shetland Sheep Dog!

199
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,850
Yes, her name is Christie!

200
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,250
I see, the King and Queen in a detective story.

201
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,050
By any chance, is she the one

202
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,450
who reserved that stereo set?

203
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,750
Yes.

204
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,950
I thought it'd be a good gift to give to my younger brother

205
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,150
in celebration of his enrollment into high school.

206
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,250
If you ask me,

207
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,850
the sooner you separate the two dogs, the better.

208
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:53,850
Huh?

209
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,650
You can't sell cross breed babies for a high price.

210
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,850
Needless to worry,

211
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,450
because Arthur is going to be leaving for England soon.

212
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,850
Isn't that right, Kanou?

213
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,850
Yes.

214
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,350
I wonder what's got onto Doyle?

215
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,950
It's his snack time.

216
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,150
What?

217
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,150
My grandfather liked dogs a lot, too.

218
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:25,550
In an attempt to show Doyle to my late grandfather,

219
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,050
my mother used to feed Doyle

220
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,250
in front of the Buddhist altar in the Japanese room.

221
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:34,150
And Doyle acquired the habit of doing so ever since.

222
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,450
So, when the clock in the Japanese room strikes 12:00 noon,

223
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,950
he runs over to the room,

224
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,750
sits on the cushion and waits.

225
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,750
A cushion?

226
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,950
Yes, Doyle loves the blue cushion,

227
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,450
so he bring it in front of the altar himself.

228
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,550
But doesn't the clock ring at midnight, too?

229
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,450
What happens if Doyle mistakenly brings the cushion, then?

230
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,950
That's no problem

231
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,750
because we asked the clock maker to fix the clock

232
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,750
so that it would only ring at 12:00 noon.

233
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,150
Are you sure you don't mind

234
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:09,250
me taking such a precious clock with me?

235
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,250
Yes.

236
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,750
Because mother mentioned that it's about time we stop pampering Doyle

237
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,250
and start feeding him only twice a day, in the morning and at night.

238
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,050
Oh, I guess it's all right then.

239
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,750
Go ahead and look through that space.

240
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,550
Doyle is sitting there, isn't he?

241
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,350
On the blue cushion...

242
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,250
Doyle's not there.

243
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,050
The blue cushion is not out either.

244
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,450
Huh?

245
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,850
Maybe he couldn't pull out the blue cushions

246
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,650
because there in between the brown ones?

247
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,550
No, because he usually pulls the blue cushion out

248
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,850
from under the others with his mouth and puts it on the floor.

249
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,750
Strange. I wonder where he went.

250
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,750
Anyway, let's split up and look for him.

251
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,050
What if he's stuck some place and cannot come out?

252
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,350
Yes.

253
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,050
Doyle!

254
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,250
Where are you?

255
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,850
Come out here, Doyle!

256
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,050
Doyle!

257
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,550
He's nowhere in sight.

258
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,650
Hey, did you find him?

259
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,850
No, we didn't!

260
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,050
We even looked in the bath tub.

261
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,950
Arthur's barking!

262
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,550
Christie's barking, too!

263
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,550
The backyard. Let's go!

264
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,250
Smoke is coming out of the incinerator!

265
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:35,150
We've stopped using that incinerator long time ago.

266
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,450
Don't tell me that...

267
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,850
Shoes?

268
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,550
It can't be...

269
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,650
A collar?

270
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,250
Don't tell me that's...

271
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,050
Doyle's...

272
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:01,250
It can't be...

273
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:18,610
Doyle...

274
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,910
Don't worry.

275
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,310
Only this collar was burned.

276
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,310
There was no dead body of a dog in the incinerator.

277
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,210
By the way, is this really Doyle's collar?

278
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,810
I didn't see anything just a while ago.

279
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,010
Yes.

280
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,110
It's usually covered with his fur and is not visible.

281
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,310
It's burnt black, but I'm sure of the color and the print on it.

282
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:43,510
Grandpa bought this collar in France for the Papillon

283
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,610
that he used to own.

284
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,810
It's very old.

285
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,910
Please take a look over here!

286
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,410
The lock of the back door is open.

287
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,610
Really...

288
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,910
I see.

289
00:14:54,910 --> 00:15:00,010
The one who took Doyle away, fled from this back gate.

290
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,810
But why?

291
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,910
Why was the collar is in the incinerator?

292
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,310
The one who took Doyle away took off the collar

293
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:09,210
so that it would be hard to tell one Papillon from the other.

294
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,610
Besides, that collar was a unique collar with decoration on it.

295
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,810
I don't think so.

296
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,610
Because why would somebody who steals a dog and is in a rush to flee

297
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,310
go out of the way to burn a collar which is covered under the fur

298
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,710
that can't be seen and leave traces of how he or she escaped?

299
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,810
I'm sure that the one who did it

300
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,910
wanted to make it look like he or she fled outside of the premises.

301
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,110
Which means that Doyle is still...

302
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,710
Yes. It's most likely that Doyle

303
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,710
is being hidden somewhere in this house.

304
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,110
Hey, does that mean...

305
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:44,310
Don't tell me that the person who hid Doyle is still in this house?

306
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:49,010
Hey, don't tell me that you suspect us?

307
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,310
Oh, no. But...

308
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,510
But if it's as that boy's says,

309
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,310
we already have a definite idea of who did it.

310
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,810
Look over there.

311
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,110
Those ladies shoes.

312
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:04,210
Those are mine, but why?

313
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,010
Come on, let's not play dumb!

314
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,910
Aren't those your shoes that you brought from the front entrance?

315
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,410
No.

316
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,910
That can't be.

317
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,510
The criminal would never leave shoes out like that

318
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,310
and if someone is seen carrying their shoes in the house,

319
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,710
anyone would deem that person to be acting suspicious?

320
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:24,710
Ms. Hasuki, you've been here more than one or two times, right?

321
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,210
That's right.

322
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,710
If so, that you could've trained Christie

323
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,210
to bring your shoes from the front entrance to here,

324
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:36,710
then back to the front entrance again, right?

325
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:39,110
That's ridiculous.

326
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:43,310
Anyway, let's go and look for Doyle again!

327
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,410
We'll go with him,

328
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,110
so why don't you three go and search for Doyle together, Doc?

329
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,110
Okay.

330
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,510
But, Conan, how are we going to look for the dog?

331
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:02,410
We've looked practically all over the house just a while ago.

332
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:06,210
That's why we don't search for places where dog might hide this time,

333
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:09,410
but we look for places where humans would hide them.

334
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:13,010
That's right! Let's have Arthur help us!

335
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,210
Don't you get it?

336
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,810
His nose.

337
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,410
We'll make him help us by using the best weapon he has,

338
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,010
which is his nose.

339
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,110
A dog's nose

340
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,710
is much more capable of sniffing out smell than humans.

341
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,710
So, if we make Arthur sniff Doyle's smell,

342
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,010
I'm sure he will help us find him.

343
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,910
Here it is.

344
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,210
The cushion used in Doyle's bed.

345
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:38,110
Come on, Arthur.

346
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,610
But he's not a police dog.

347
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,110
But it may work!

348
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,410
Because father used to play around with Arthur doing things like this.

349
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,410
I think he's found him.

350
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,110
He's going into the Japanese room!

351
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,410
That means Doyle is in there!

352
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,710
Huh?

353
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,810
A blue cushion?

354
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:10,610
Come to think of it, Doyle likes blue cushions too, right?

355
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,210
Do dogs like blue?

356
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,410
Huh?

357
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,610
That's strange.

358
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,310
Just a while ago, there were only two blue cushions.

359
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:25,010
Counting the one that Arthur brought out makes three blue cushions.

360
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,410
One extra cushion.

361
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,710
What does this all mean?

362
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:37,310
Maybe he can't do it.

363
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:41,910
Hey, did Arthur ever do something like hide shoes?

364
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,410
No, he once did the opposite, though.

365
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,310
It was back when Arthur was still a puppy.

366
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,410
When I stood up,

367
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,610
Arthur, thinking that I was going to take him for a walk,

368
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,410
would rush over to the front door,

369
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:56,310
take my shoes out of the shoe cabinet and bringing it to me.

370
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:00,910
But once he found out that it wasn't always the case,

371
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,210
he stopped doing it.

372
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,510
But that's fantastic.

373
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,010
Arthur is no ordinary dog, after all!

374
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:10,510
Go ahead and sniff Doyle's smell once more!

375
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,510
There he goes!

376
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,610
But he stopped in front of the living room.

377
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:23,110
He looks like to be thinking.

378
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,210
Oh, he's walking again.

379
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,310
He's heading for the front entrance!

380
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,510
Huh? He's gone outside.

381
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,510
Maybe Doyle was taken outside!

382
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:43,710
Oh, come on. All he's doing is flirting with Christie.

383
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,610
Maybe he's just tired of searching already.

384
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,310
I guess it can't be helped.

385
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:53,210
Hey, is there any place that Doyle usually hides when he was scolded?

386
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:57,010
Maybe when the person removed the collar by force,

387
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,610
Doyle got scared and hid somewhere on his own?

388
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:05,510
Arthur used to hide under my bed a lot.

389
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,210
Under the bed?

390
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:10,010
Yes. When I first got Doyle,

391
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,010
I used scold Arthur a lot.

392
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,510
When I was hugging Doyle as a puppy in the living room,

393
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,210
Arthur used to get jealous

394
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,110
and tear the cushion in the living room apart.

395
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,910
They get along now, though.

396
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,810
I wonder where Doyle is hiding though.

397
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,010
Poor thing if he's trembling in fright somewhere.

398
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,510
Right.

399
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:35,910
The people who are looking for you are bound to find you one day.

400
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,310
There are nothing tougher than to live in terror hiding.

401
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,110
Hey! That's enough.

402
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,310
-What are you all sulky about? -Nothing.

403
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,610
I'm just trying to tell an optimist with no real strategy prepared

404
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,910
of the dangerous situation involved here.

405
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,310
I don't know for what reason,

406
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,610
but what I know for sure is that

407
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,310
one of their men were on that bus.

408
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:59,510
If they even had the slightest notion of my identity back then,

409
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:03,010
me, you and everyone else...

410
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,810
Don't worry about it!

411
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:07,610
I can assure you that you haven't been identified.

412
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:10,710
Why? How can you be so sure?

413
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,610
Just as you can sniff them out, I just know.

414
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:18,410
I can tell when someone has a threatening air about them.

415
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,910
I guess you could call it the intuition of a detective.

416
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,310
Well, if I were able to tell who possesses this threatening air,

417
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,810
I wouldn't have problems.

418
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:29,010
But I know for sure that no such person was on board that bus.

419
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:32,210
That is, the person that is making you feel threatened.

420
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,810
What's with that look on your face?

421
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,310
Do you despise detectives or what?

422
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,210
No, I'm just totally bored.

423
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,010
Oh, I see.

424
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:44,410
Let me recall once again.

425
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,710
Back when Doyle disappeared...

426
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:51,810
At the chime when the clock struck 12:00,

427
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,010
Doyle headed for the Japanese room where he could get his snack,

428
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,810
and disappeared from our view.

429
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:57,810
After that,

430
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:01,210
we all followed Mr. Kanou who went into the kitchen

431
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,810
to get the cheese snack.

432
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:07,810
Then we went to the Japanese room and found that Doyle was not there.

433
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:11,810
So, we split up and looked all over the house for Doyle.

434
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,010
This is approximately how the layout of the house is.

435
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,310
We don't really know who searched where yet.

436
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:21,910
But where on earth did the person hide Doyle?

437
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:26,510
And how is that person planning to carry Doyle out of here?

438
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,220
Next Conan's Hint:

439
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,380
"Traces of the cushion"

440
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,500
Let's mimic Doyle's bark.

441
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,500
Arthur! Christie!

442
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:41,320
They all sound the same.
