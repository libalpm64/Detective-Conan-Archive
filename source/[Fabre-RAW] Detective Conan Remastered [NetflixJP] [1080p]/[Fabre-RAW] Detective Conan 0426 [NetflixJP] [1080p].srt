1
00:00:02,144 --> 00:00:03,944
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:03,944 --> 00:00:05,644
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:05,644 --> 00:00:07,044
Feeling unpleasant early in the New Year.

4
00:00:07,044 --> 00:00:08,244
Ran receives a love letter.

5
00:00:08,244 --> 00:00:10,344
A crime gives extra jolt to a shocked heart.

6
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:11,944
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,944 --> 00:00:13,544
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,544 --> 00:00:15,544
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:59,154 --> 00:02:01,454
And Kitada from Class C

10
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,454
-was brushed off. -Oh, was the girl Mouri?

11
00:02:03,454 --> 00:02:05,254
Oh, Ran!

12
00:02:05,254 --> 00:02:06,554
Are you going home already?

13
00:02:07,554 --> 00:02:09,554
Sonoko. Yeah.

14
00:02:09,554 --> 00:02:12,554
I'm thinking of making something good for Conan,

15
00:02:12,554 --> 00:02:15,054
because I've been lazy making meals recently.

16
00:02:16,754 --> 00:02:19,954
Is this what a young and beautiful high school girl should say?

17
00:02:19,954 --> 00:02:21,654
How about you learn something from her, Suzuki?

18
00:02:21,654 --> 00:02:23,854
Shut up!

19
00:02:23,854 --> 00:02:25,854
Okay, I guess I'll go home too then.

20
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,154
Will you wait for me by the shoes box,

21
00:02:27,154 --> 00:02:28,954
while I go get my bag?

22
00:02:28,954 --> 00:02:30,454
Okay, I get it.

23
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,754
"Ms. Ran Mouri"

24
00:02:38,254 --> 00:02:40,054
"Ms. Ran Mouri"

25
00:02:44,054 --> 00:02:46,254
Don't tell me that this is?

26
00:02:46,254 --> 00:02:47,454
What shall I do?

27
00:02:53,654 --> 00:02:57,154
No. I guess I'll open it at home after all.

28
00:02:57,154 --> 00:02:58,554
Sorry to keep you waiting, Ran!

29
00:02:59,854 --> 00:03:01,754
Huh? What's this?

30
00:03:04,454 --> 00:03:06,954
Ms. Ran Mouri?

31
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:08,654
S.H.?

32
00:03:08,654 --> 00:03:10,254
Hey, Ran this is...

33
00:03:11,654 --> 00:03:14,454
It was in my shoes compartment. What shall I do?

34
00:03:14,454 --> 00:03:16,154
What do you mean, what shall I do?

35
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,154
What else?

36
00:03:19,354 --> 00:03:25,354
"Love Letter to Ran"

37
00:03:25,354 --> 00:03:28,354
Quick, rip it open!

38
00:03:28,354 --> 00:03:30,054
Hold your horses.

39
00:03:34,054 --> 00:03:39,154
"Please forgive me for suddenly sending you a letter like this."

40
00:03:39,154 --> 00:03:40,854
"When I think of you,"

41
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:43,454
"my heart beats so hard that I can't even sleep at night."

42
00:03:43,454 --> 00:03:44,954
"Please meet me just once."

43
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:46,054
"Tomorrow after school,"

44
00:03:46,054 --> 00:03:49,854
"I'll be waiting you in front of the fountain at Beika Park."

45
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,254
You did it, Ran! It's a love letter!

46
00:03:53,254 --> 00:03:56,554
He's probably an under classman.

47
00:03:56,554 --> 00:03:59,354
He doesn't know you already have Shinichi.

48
00:03:59,354 --> 00:04:01,454
-Hey! Shinichi has nothing to do with this... -What!

49
00:04:02,454 --> 00:04:05,854
I tell you! You can't even talk safely around here!

50
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:07,254
Sorry, sorry...

51
00:04:08,754 --> 00:04:10,054
Let's go some place else!

52
00:04:10,054 --> 00:04:11,654
Wait a second, Sonoko.

53
00:04:11,654 --> 00:04:13,354
A love letter.

54
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:15,654
Come to think of it, I haven't received any recently.

55
00:04:15,654 --> 00:04:17,154
How about you, Ran?

56
00:04:17,154 --> 00:04:18,954
What do you mean?

57
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:22,054
Don't tell me this is the first time you received one.

58
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:23,454
It's my first.

59
00:04:23,454 --> 00:04:25,154
Seriously?

60
00:04:25,154 --> 00:04:28,354
I see, you're with Shinichi all the time

61
00:04:28,354 --> 00:04:29,554
so nobody can approach you.

62
00:04:29,554 --> 00:04:32,154
I said that Shinichi has nothing to do with this!

63
00:04:35,954 --> 00:04:37,754
I wonder who he is?

64
00:04:37,754 --> 00:04:39,054
What?

65
00:04:39,054 --> 00:04:40,854
An alumni of the kendo club, maybe?

66
00:04:40,854 --> 00:04:43,554
See, he's holding a wooden sword.

67
00:04:43,554 --> 00:04:46,354
Never mind him, the love letter's more important!

68
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:47,954
-Let's go. -Hey!

69
00:04:52,254 --> 00:04:54,854
And, what are you going to do?

70
00:04:54,854 --> 00:04:57,054
You're going to Beika Park, aren't you?

71
00:04:57,054 --> 00:04:58,954
What shall I do?

72
00:04:58,954 --> 00:05:00,654
What are you troubled about?

73
00:05:00,654 --> 00:05:02,854
Go and turn him down flat.

74
00:05:02,854 --> 00:05:05,054
Tell him that you're already going with somebody.

75
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,354
Just because it doesn't have anything to do with you!

76
00:05:10,354 --> 00:05:12,454
You really seemed troubled.

77
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:13,554
Yeah.

78
00:05:13,554 --> 00:05:15,654
I guess I have no choice, leave it to me.

79
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:18,754
-Huh? -I'll refuse very nicely for you.

80
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:21,754
What are you going to refuse?

81
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,654
Oh, glasses kid!

82
00:05:23,654 --> 00:05:25,654
What're you doing in a place like this?

83
00:05:25,654 --> 00:05:28,654
You look very serious, Ran.

84
00:05:28,654 --> 00:05:31,754
Well, of course, because we were talking about

85
00:05:31,754 --> 00:05:33,754
the first love letter Ran ever got.

86
00:05:33,754 --> 00:05:34,954
Love letter?

87
00:05:34,954 --> 00:05:36,954
Sonoko.

88
00:05:36,954 --> 00:05:38,654
My dear Ran,

89
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:42,754
I would like to hug you and kiss those cute little lips.

90
00:05:42,754 --> 00:05:44,454
That's not true, Conan.

91
00:05:44,454 --> 00:05:46,454
Nothing like that was written in the letter.

92
00:05:46,454 --> 00:05:49,654
But, it's true that you received a love letter.

93
00:05:49,654 --> 00:05:51,154
And who was it from?

94
00:05:51,154 --> 00:05:53,454
Oh, so it bothers you.

95
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:55,854
You idiot, why would I be?

96
00:05:55,854 --> 00:05:58,554
Maybe it does bother me a bit?

97
00:05:58,554 --> 00:06:00,854
You're really something, kid.

98
00:06:00,854 --> 00:06:03,554
It was from a freshman with the initials S.H.

99
00:06:03,554 --> 00:06:05,254
A freshman?

100
00:06:05,254 --> 00:06:06,554
It said that he wants to meet her tomorrow

101
00:06:06,554 --> 00:06:09,354
after school in front of the fountain at Beika Park.

102
00:06:09,354 --> 00:06:11,554
That's enough already, Sonoko.

103
00:06:11,554 --> 00:06:12,754
Since Ran seems to be troubled,

104
00:06:12,754 --> 00:06:16,954
I'm thinking of going in her place to refuse his request, understand?

105
00:06:16,954 --> 00:06:18,654
Okay, I got it.

106
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:21,054
Really, when I'm in this situation...

107
00:06:21,054 --> 00:06:22,354
Who on earth can it be?

108
00:06:22,354 --> 00:06:23,454
What shall I do?

109
00:06:23,454 --> 00:06:26,254
I wonder if I should really let Sonoko handle this?

110
00:06:26,254 --> 00:06:28,954
If he's good looking, I'll make him mine.

111
00:06:33,354 --> 00:06:35,054
I wonder what happened.

112
00:06:36,654 --> 00:06:38,054
What's the matter?

113
00:06:38,054 --> 00:06:39,254
Huh?

114
00:06:39,254 --> 00:06:43,754
If you need help, you should ask her to help you.

115
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:47,454
Her father is Detective Kogoro Mouri.

116
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:49,254
Hey, Conan.

117
00:06:49,254 --> 00:06:50,454
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:50,454 --> 00:06:52,954
And her boyfriend is the high school detective,

119
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,154
Shinichi Kudo.

120
00:06:54,154 --> 00:06:55,354
Sonoko.

121
00:06:55,354 --> 00:06:57,454
I know Detective Mouri

122
00:06:57,454 --> 00:07:00,554
as well as Shinichi Kudo, the high school detective.

123
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:03,154
I'm an alumni of Teitan High School.

124
00:07:03,154 --> 00:07:04,454
You are?

125
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:06,954
We're sophomore.

126
00:07:06,954 --> 00:07:08,554
What shall I do?

127
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:11,154
Since the little boy offered.

128
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:12,954
Maybe I should ask for help.

129
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:16,254
Yes. It's okay, isn't it, Ran?

130
00:07:16,254 --> 00:07:18,854
Yes. Well, if it's okay with you...

131
00:07:18,854 --> 00:07:21,454
We'll help you.

132
00:07:23,054 --> 00:07:24,954
Please come in, although it's messy.

133
00:07:24,954 --> 00:07:26,454
-Hello. -Hello.

134
00:07:27,654 --> 00:07:29,154
That...

135
00:07:29,154 --> 00:07:32,454
He's my husband. He died a year ago.

136
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:34,954
Of an illness.

137
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:38,254
He was hospitalized for half a year and tried to pull through

138
00:07:38,254 --> 00:07:40,154
but he didn't make it.

139
00:07:44,954 --> 00:07:46,354
The fact is...

140
00:07:46,354 --> 00:07:49,054
it seems that someone came into the house while we were out.

141
00:07:49,054 --> 00:07:50,554
Huh?

142
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:51,954
I was out from about 1 pm,

143
00:07:51,954 --> 00:07:55,354
for about two hours with Yuta.

144
00:07:55,354 --> 00:07:58,954
And I seemed to have forgotten to to lock that glass door.

145
00:07:58,954 --> 00:08:00,854
Moreover...

146
00:08:00,854 --> 00:08:04,154
I take the rent for this place to the landlord myself,

147
00:08:04,154 --> 00:08:06,154
so I went to the bank this morning to withdraw

148
00:08:06,154 --> 00:08:07,854
the money and put it in this envelope.

149
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,254
It seems that the envelope I had in here

150
00:08:09,254 --> 00:08:11,954
was taken out once.

151
00:08:11,954 --> 00:08:13,754
Taken out?

152
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:16,454
But everything was returned, the entire amount.

153
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:20,854
How do you know that it was taken out once?

154
00:08:20,854 --> 00:08:23,054
Because of the fold mark,

155
00:08:23,054 --> 00:08:24,654
despite it being new bills, right?

156
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:26,154
Right.

157
00:08:26,154 --> 00:08:28,454
Although it's a very faint fold though.

158
00:08:28,454 --> 00:08:30,154
See.

159
00:08:30,154 --> 00:08:31,854
Also...

160
00:08:31,854 --> 00:08:34,154
Although I always leave it here...

161
00:08:36,554 --> 00:08:40,354
There are traces that this diary was read too.

162
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,054
There's still more.

163
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,954
The most obvious thing,

164
00:08:43,954 --> 00:08:46,454
is that someone placed an incense stick here.

165
00:08:46,454 --> 00:08:47,554
Huh?

166
00:08:47,554 --> 00:08:50,854
Hey, the incense stick was still lit, right?

167
00:08:50,854 --> 00:08:53,154
About how much was left of it?

168
00:08:53,154 --> 00:08:55,754
Well, about half.

169
00:08:55,754 --> 00:08:57,954
Which means that the incense stick was placed

170
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,454
there about 15 minutes ago,

171
00:09:00,454 --> 00:09:03,054
because incense stick will keep burning for about 30 minutes.

172
00:09:03,054 --> 00:09:05,254
You're really knowledgeable, aren't you, Conan?

173
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:08,254
This kid knows a lot about weird things.

174
00:09:08,254 --> 00:09:10,454
But, I wonder what's going on?

175
00:09:10,454 --> 00:09:13,954
Let's say that someone did come into the house.

176
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:17,454
The point is who, for what reason came into the house.

177
00:09:17,454 --> 00:09:18,954
Maybe it was a stalker?

178
00:09:18,954 --> 00:09:21,054
I mean going through somebody's diary.

179
00:09:21,054 --> 00:09:22,754
But, other than my diary,

180
00:09:22,754 --> 00:09:25,854
nothing else seems to have been looked into or taken.

181
00:09:25,854 --> 00:09:27,554
Then it could've been a thief!

182
00:09:27,554 --> 00:09:30,454
But, then the money wouldn't be returned.

183
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:34,754
Besides, it's unthinkable that a thief would offer incense either.

184
00:09:35,754 --> 00:09:39,854
I felt kind of creepy so I called the officer

185
00:09:39,854 --> 00:09:41,954
but was told that they have no way of investigating

186
00:09:41,954 --> 00:09:44,254
if nothing was taken.

187
00:09:44,254 --> 00:09:45,854
The incense stick.

188
00:09:45,854 --> 00:09:48,354
That's what bothers me the most.

189
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,354
The culprit is her acquaintance,

190
00:09:50,354 --> 00:09:53,654
or her husband's acquaintance.

191
00:09:53,654 --> 00:09:56,454
Hey, how did you get to know your husband?

192
00:09:57,454 --> 00:09:58,754
Conan!

193
00:09:58,754 --> 00:10:01,454
He's a really precocious kid.

194
00:10:01,454 --> 00:10:04,354
We used to be classmates in high school.

195
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:08,454
But, we didn't think much of each other during high school.

196
00:10:08,454 --> 00:10:09,454
After graduating from university,

197
00:10:09,454 --> 00:10:11,754
we happened to run into each other on the street,

198
00:10:11,754 --> 00:10:13,254
and started going with each other.

199
00:10:13,254 --> 00:10:15,954
Then, it's different from you, Ran.

200
00:10:15,954 --> 00:10:17,654
Of course, it's different!

201
00:10:17,654 --> 00:10:20,354
You said that your diary was read,

202
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:22,554
but what kind of things do you have written in it?

203
00:10:22,554 --> 00:10:25,354
There's nothing special written in it.

204
00:10:25,354 --> 00:10:28,754
Although I'm busy everyday working and taking care of my son,

205
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,954
I'll keep myself going thinking of my husband,

206
00:10:30,954 --> 00:10:33,154
or something like that.

207
00:10:33,154 --> 00:10:36,854
It must be really hard being alone, Yuriko.

208
00:10:38,354 --> 00:10:42,054
There was a time when I thought of committing suicide.

209
00:10:43,654 --> 00:10:45,554
But, I had my son,

210
00:10:45,554 --> 00:10:48,054
and after recalling how hard my husband tried to live,

211
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:50,654
despite suffering through his illness,

212
00:10:50,654 --> 00:10:53,054
I had second thoughts about doing so.

213
00:10:53,054 --> 00:10:55,154
Not only my husband, but there are many people in this world,

214
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,454
who cannot live despite wanting to do so.

215
00:10:58,454 --> 00:11:01,654
I thought that I would never be forgiven

216
00:11:01,654 --> 00:11:04,354
if I took my own life despite knowing this.

217
00:11:05,954 --> 00:11:08,954
I can't help but cry.

218
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:12,554
Maybe,

219
00:11:12,554 --> 00:11:15,654
the culprit felt the same way we feel now.

220
00:11:15,654 --> 00:11:18,354
If so, the culprit...

221
00:11:18,354 --> 00:11:20,154
Just the other day,

222
00:11:20,154 --> 00:11:23,754
I saw news on TV that someone came in and robbed the house,

223
00:11:23,754 --> 00:11:27,454
but changed his mind and left without taking anything.

224
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,054
Really, Conan?

225
00:11:29,054 --> 00:11:30,454
Yes, it was the house of a teacher

226
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:33,854
that had taken good care of him when he was a child

227
00:11:33,854 --> 00:11:37,354
and he went in without knowing about it.

228
00:11:37,354 --> 00:11:41,154
-Yuriko, are you a school teacher... -No, I'm not.

229
00:11:41,154 --> 00:11:45,154
But even if you weren't a teacher, you could be somebody they know.

230
00:11:45,154 --> 00:11:47,754
More to the point, you could be somebody special to them.

231
00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:50,854
Maybe I should start writing a diary too.

232
00:11:50,854 --> 00:11:54,754
Moreover, the culprit read the diary of that special person!

233
00:11:54,754 --> 00:11:59,054
The diary of someone who is living with all her might despite her plight.

234
00:11:59,054 --> 00:12:01,554
I see! That's why he didn't take anything,

235
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,854
offered incense and left!

236
00:12:03,854 --> 00:12:05,454
That's right.

237
00:12:05,454 --> 00:12:07,254
That special person could be someone

238
00:12:07,254 --> 00:12:11,254
that sent you a love letter during your high school days.

239
00:12:11,254 --> 00:12:12,654
Come off it, Sonoko.

240
00:12:12,654 --> 00:12:14,554
I'm seriously thinking this incident over, you know!

241
00:12:14,554 --> 00:12:16,454
I'm serious too!

242
00:12:16,454 --> 00:12:18,154
What do you think?

243
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:23,254
Well, yes. I received such a letter just once.

244
00:12:23,254 --> 00:12:24,654
When?

245
00:12:24,654 --> 00:12:26,454
In January of my senior year.

246
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,854
But, we never talked to each other,

247
00:12:29,854 --> 00:12:32,454
knew each other's face or name either.

248
00:12:32,454 --> 00:12:33,754
We were never in the same class

249
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:36,754
all through our years during high school.

250
00:12:36,754 --> 00:12:40,454
But, it seems he used to always watch me,

251
00:12:40,454 --> 00:12:42,654
and it was just that I never noticed.

252
00:12:42,654 --> 00:12:45,454
Indeed genuine one-sided love.

253
00:12:45,454 --> 00:12:46,554
In the letter it said,

254
00:12:46,554 --> 00:12:50,454
"Please meet me in front of the fountain at Beika Park."

255
00:12:50,454 --> 00:12:51,554
What?

256
00:12:51,554 --> 00:12:53,154
Huh? What?

257
00:12:53,154 --> 00:12:55,254
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

258
00:12:55,254 --> 00:12:57,154
And? Did you go?

259
00:12:57,154 --> 00:12:58,954
I wasn't sure what to do,

260
00:12:58,954 --> 00:13:01,054
but he was waiting for me there

261
00:13:01,054 --> 00:13:03,454
so, I told him how I honestly felt.

262
00:13:03,454 --> 00:13:05,154
What did you say?

263
00:13:05,154 --> 00:13:09,054
I think I said, "I'm really happy of how you feel for me,"

264
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,854
"but my head is filled with wanting to pass the entrance exam for now."

265
00:13:11,854 --> 00:13:16,154
He went home without saying a word.

266
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,354
"Graduation memorial album"

267
00:13:19,454 --> 00:13:20,954
Let's see...

268
00:13:20,954 --> 00:13:22,054
He's the one.

269
00:13:22,054 --> 00:13:24,954
"Shuhei Nagai" -Mr. Shuhei Nagai.

270
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:26,354
Wait a second, this man...

271
00:13:40,881 --> 00:13:44,681
Nagai came to our high school?

272
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:48,581
Yuriko, weren't you in the kendo club?

273
00:13:48,581 --> 00:13:49,881
Yes.

274
00:13:49,881 --> 00:13:52,281
-I was captain of the club in my sophomore year. -Mama!

275
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:53,581
Just as I thought!

276
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:54,881
So, that does it!

277
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:56,081
What?

278
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:59,081
Most likely, he's the one who broke into your house.

279
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,081
I agree too.

280
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:06,781
Yuriko, haven't you heard anything about him after you graduated?

281
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,481
I think it was about two years ago.

282
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:12,681
I heard a bit about him from my husband's friend.

283
00:14:12,681 --> 00:14:15,681
I haven't told anyone about Nagai, including my husband,

284
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:18,081
so when my husband and his friend was talking,

285
00:14:18,081 --> 00:14:19,881
Nagai's subject came up as someone who went to school in the same year.

286
00:14:22,281 --> 00:14:23,781
He stayed out of university for a year,

287
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:26,281
but, despite that couldn't get into the university of his choice.

288
00:14:26,281 --> 00:14:27,281
Even after graduation,

289
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:30,081
he ended up working for a company he didn't like.

290
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:31,581
As a result, he quit the company

291
00:14:31,581 --> 00:14:34,081
and seems to be doing freelance work now.

292
00:14:35,581 --> 00:14:37,481
Could you have by any chance

293
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:40,181
entered a top-notch university just like that?

294
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:42,881
I don't know if it was top-notch or what,

295
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:45,281
but I did get into the university of my choice.

296
00:14:45,281 --> 00:14:48,481
So, that's the story.

297
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:50,781
What is it, Sonoko?

298
00:14:50,781 --> 00:14:53,081
Will you hear me out?

299
00:14:53,081 --> 00:14:55,281
Hey, hey, are you know what you're doing?

300
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:59,381
I'm sure that Shuhei Nagai never forgot you

301
00:14:59,381 --> 00:15:04,381
ever since he met you in front of the fountain at Beika Park.

302
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:08,281
But he probably couldn't contact you because he had inferiority complex

303
00:15:08,281 --> 00:15:10,281
of not being able to enter a top-notch university like you did.

304
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:11,981
After that, even after going out into the society,

305
00:15:11,981 --> 00:15:13,481
nothing worked out for him.

306
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:15,281
He finally runs out of money and comes back

307
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,881
to Beikacho where he knows his way around,

308
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:19,481
with the intention of breaking into a house.

309
00:15:19,481 --> 00:15:21,581
While he goes around looking for the house of rich people,

310
00:15:21,581 --> 00:15:23,181
most probably like mine,

311
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:26,381
he notices that the glass window of your house

312
00:15:26,381 --> 00:15:29,681
is slightly opened.

313
00:15:29,681 --> 00:15:33,081
And after finding out somehow that no one was home.

314
00:15:39,781 --> 00:15:42,881
Then, he happened to notice.

315
00:15:42,881 --> 00:15:45,681
The woman in the picture was who he had one-sidedly fallen in love with

316
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:47,281
during his high school days.

317
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:50,281
The man in the picture with her also looked familiar.

318
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:52,281
He was the classmate from same high school.

319
00:15:52,281 --> 00:15:54,281
Moreover, seeing the picture on the altar,

320
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:57,481
he realizes that the classmate had passed away.

321
00:15:58,781 --> 00:16:00,781
He then sees the diary,

322
00:16:00,781 --> 00:16:03,381
although he knows he shouldn't he reads it.

323
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:06,281
He finds out that she is living

324
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:08,681
with all her might along with her little child.

325
00:16:08,681 --> 00:16:13,181
He also thinks about his classmate who died at the young age of 20.

326
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:15,581
He is ashamed of himself for doing what he did,

327
00:16:15,581 --> 00:16:18,881
being as young and healthy as he is.

328
00:16:18,881 --> 00:16:23,481
When I watch Ran practicing karate with all her might,

329
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:26,481
myself sometimes think I've got to live with all my might too.

330
00:16:26,481 --> 00:16:27,781
Sonoko.

331
00:16:29,581 --> 00:16:33,281
Shuhei Nagai decides to start life all over again.

332
00:16:33,281 --> 00:16:35,281
So he puts the money back into the envelope

333
00:16:35,281 --> 00:16:37,681
and he offers incense stick in honour

334
00:16:37,681 --> 00:16:41,681
for his classmates, then he leaves.

335
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:48,981
And, he made a final trip to the high school that the graduated

336
00:16:48,981 --> 00:16:51,981
from vowing never to come back to this town again.

337
00:16:53,381 --> 00:16:57,181
It just so happened that the kendo club was practicing.

338
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:03,181
Back then, he was recalling memories of you

339
00:17:03,181 --> 00:17:05,181
and soaking in deep emotion.

340
00:17:05,181 --> 00:17:08,681
So, he could be at Beika Park looking at the fountain just around now.

341
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:11,381
No.

342
00:17:11,381 --> 00:17:14,081
You're fantastic, Sonoko!

343
00:17:14,081 --> 00:17:16,081
It's very similar to mine.

344
00:17:17,381 --> 00:17:19,781
Wait a second.

345
00:17:19,781 --> 00:17:22,481
The Nagai that we saw in front of the gym

346
00:17:22,481 --> 00:17:25,881
seemed a bit different from your deduction, Sonoko.

347
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:29,281
He seemed, well sort of, a bit more desperate.

348
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,881
Is that so?

349
00:17:30,881 --> 00:17:34,881
Besides, it kind of bothered me that he was holding a wooden sword too.

350
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:37,481
-A wooden sword? -Yes.

351
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:42,681
Did you have anything else written in your diary?

352
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:45,481
To be honest,

353
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,581
there is one thing I didn't tell you all about.

354
00:17:49,581 --> 00:17:52,481
Ten days ago, I had a slight accident

355
00:17:52,481 --> 00:17:54,381
with a man who was riding a bicycle.

356
00:17:55,381 --> 00:17:58,481
Back then, he told me that he was just fine,

357
00:17:58,481 --> 00:18:01,881
but he later came to tell me that he started having neck problems.

358
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:02,981
That's...

359
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:06,181
I told him that I'd pay for his medical bills,

360
00:18:06,181 --> 00:18:08,181
but he asked me date with him

361
00:18:08,181 --> 00:18:10,481
in place of paying for the medical bills.

362
00:18:10,481 --> 00:18:11,781
He was very persistent.

363
00:18:11,781 --> 00:18:13,281
How terrible!

364
00:18:13,281 --> 00:18:15,081
He seemed to be of bad character,

365
00:18:15,081 --> 00:18:16,581
so I was scared that if I refused too strongly,

366
00:18:16,581 --> 00:18:20,181
he would to something to Yuta.

367
00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:22,181
That's why I didn't tell anybody about this.

368
00:18:22,181 --> 00:18:24,281
Where is that man today?

369
00:18:24,281 --> 00:18:26,281
He's out on a business trip till sundown.

370
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:29,981
That's why I know it's not him who broke in.

371
00:18:29,981 --> 00:18:34,281
Everything you just told us is written in your diary, isn't it?

372
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:35,681
Yes.

373
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,881
That man called Nagai had a wooden sword, didn't he?

374
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:39,981
Maybe...

375
00:18:45,681 --> 00:18:49,081
What's with you?

376
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:50,981
Are you that woman's man?

377
00:18:50,981 --> 00:18:52,781
No!

378
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:55,681
Stay, stay away from her.

379
00:18:56,981 --> 00:19:00,981
Keep your hands off her son too.

380
00:19:00,981 --> 00:19:03,481
What? I don't know what the heck you're talking about!

381
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:09,381
Why you?

382
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:16,881
"Ryujin Real Estate Company"

383
00:19:19,881 --> 00:19:20,881
Conan?

384
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:28,281
Hey, hey! Are you gone already?

385
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:31,781
-Don't touch her. -What?

386
00:19:31,781 --> 00:19:36,081
Don't go near her.

387
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:38,181
What? I can't hear you.

388
00:19:38,181 --> 00:19:39,381
Nagai!

389
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,881
What's with you guys?

390
00:19:49,581 --> 00:19:50,881
What is it, kid?

391
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:53,981
Hey, it's strange, mister.

392
00:19:53,981 --> 00:19:56,481
Your neck moves?

393
00:19:56,481 --> 00:19:59,881
-You filthy kid! -A scum like you!

394
00:19:59,881 --> 00:20:02,081
What do you want young lady?

395
00:20:07,481 --> 00:20:11,181
Your neck is really in trouble now, mister!

396
00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:12,481
Nagai!

397
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,981
Are you all right, Nagai?

398
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:18,981
I'm sorry, I...

399
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:20,881
Read your diary.

400
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:23,081
It's okay, you don't have to say anything.

401
00:20:23,081 --> 00:20:24,281
I...

402
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:27,181
Wanted to help you.

403
00:20:29,081 --> 00:20:30,581
11 years ago.

404
00:20:30,581 --> 00:20:31,781
Huh?

405
00:20:31,781 --> 00:20:35,281
11 years ago, I was really happy

406
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:37,281
when you came to the park.

407
00:20:38,781 --> 00:20:41,981
I didn't think you would come.

408
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:44,781
Nagai.

409
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:54,181
I'll go see him myself, after all.

410
00:20:54,181 --> 00:20:55,481
What?

411
00:20:55,481 --> 00:20:57,781
Well, I don't know how to put it,

412
00:20:57,781 --> 00:21:00,681
but I'll tell him how I honestly feel.

413
00:21:00,681 --> 00:21:04,681
I think that I should act in good faith to the one who sent me the letter.

414
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:07,981
Yes. I think it's best you do too.

415
00:22:40,448 --> 00:22:42,648
"Beika Park"

416
00:22:48,648 --> 00:22:50,248
I made it.

417
00:22:54,348 --> 00:22:55,448
Jeez.

418
00:22:56,448 --> 00:22:57,848
Ran was saying that

419
00:22:57,848 --> 00:23:01,648
she's going to tell the guy how she honestly feels.

420
00:23:01,648 --> 00:23:03,748
I wonder if she's going to tell him about me...

421
00:23:09,948 --> 00:23:11,048
I'm sorry.

422
00:23:11,048 --> 00:23:12,548
I wrote that I'd be waiting here

423
00:23:12,548 --> 00:23:14,248
and yet I made you wait instead.

424
00:23:15,648 --> 00:23:16,848
Which means...

425
00:23:16,848 --> 00:23:18,148
What?

426
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:21,848
I'm your fan, the captain of the karate club!

427
00:23:21,848 --> 00:23:23,448
Please accept this.

428
00:23:23,448 --> 00:23:24,948
Thank you.

429
00:23:24,948 --> 00:23:27,148
Please keep up your good work!

430
00:23:27,148 --> 00:23:28,248
Goodbye!

431
00:23:30,648 --> 00:23:32,948
What's going on?

432
00:23:32,948 --> 00:23:34,948
It wasn't a freshman boy.

433
00:23:34,948 --> 00:23:37,448
Sonoko? Conan too?

434
00:23:39,748 --> 00:23:41,548
I thought that today for sure

435
00:23:41,548 --> 00:23:43,148
I would be able to hear how you truly feel and yet.

436
00:23:43,148 --> 00:23:44,648
Too bad!

437
00:23:44,648 --> 00:23:47,648
But popular with girls,

438
00:23:47,648 --> 00:23:49,048
just as expected of you, Ran!

439
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,800
Next Conan's Hint:

440
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,660
"A girl who looks like Ai Haibara"

441
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,740
Haibara, you sure act like an adult.

442
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,720
I'll bet you're lying about your age.
