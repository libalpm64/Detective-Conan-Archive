1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,000
Ski trails.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,100
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,800
A murder feigned to be an accident.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,200
Disclose the subtle trick using the snowman!

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,700
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,300
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,400
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,137 --> 00:02:01,437
We came to the snowy mountains with Dr. Agasa.

9
00:02:01,437 --> 00:02:04,237
Beside Genta and the others who are making a snowman,

10
00:02:04,237 --> 00:02:06,237
there are four art university students who are making a snowman

11
00:02:06,237 --> 00:02:09,037
for their graduation project who we become acquainted with.

12
00:02:18,237 --> 00:02:20,037
Yes, this is Sakuko.

13
00:02:20,037 --> 00:02:22,637
Huh? Talk with me?

14
00:02:22,637 --> 00:02:23,737
Right now?

15
00:02:24,537 --> 00:02:29,037
Then one of them, Ms. Sakuko Kokura,

16
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:32,937
is found dead in a lake below a cliff by the lodge.

17
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:38,637
Well then, let's go to the cliff where she is thought to have fallen from.

18
00:02:38,637 --> 00:02:41,737
There may be traces of an accident left, too.

19
00:02:41,737 --> 00:02:43,237
Accident?

20
00:02:43,237 --> 00:02:44,937
It can't be.

21
00:02:44,937 --> 00:02:48,537
I wonder if a person who promised to have meals with others in an hour

22
00:02:48,537 --> 00:02:50,237
would go out into the blizzard, carry the snowboard

23
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:53,137
and go all the way up the ski trail?

24
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:58,237
If this is homicide, the culprit must be one of these three.

25
00:02:58,237 --> 00:02:59,337
I can't figure out...

26
00:03:02,037 --> 00:03:04,437
how Sakuko who was in the lodge...

27
00:03:05,337 --> 00:03:09,537
was thrown into the lake.

28
00:03:11,437 --> 00:03:17,237
"The Unbreakable Snowman (Part 2)"

29
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:22,737
This is probably the place where she fell.

30
00:03:22,737 --> 00:03:26,037
Despite the fence being broken, all that's left is the sign.

31
00:03:26,037 --> 00:03:27,337
It seems to have broken last week

32
00:03:27,337 --> 00:03:29,437
and it was scheduled to be repaired this weekend.

33
00:03:30,537 --> 00:03:33,837
There seems to be no trace of the snowboard here.

34
00:03:33,837 --> 00:03:35,937
It's possible that they could've been erased by the blizzard.

35
00:03:39,537 --> 00:03:40,637
Snowman?

36
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:44,437
Could this possibly be it?

37
00:03:44,437 --> 00:03:47,937
The graduation project that you mentioned?

38
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:49,737
Yes. What about it?

39
00:03:49,737 --> 00:03:52,737
While you were making this, Mr. Itabashi,

40
00:03:52,737 --> 00:03:56,137
did you hear Sakuko's voice?

41
00:03:56,137 --> 00:03:58,237
I mean, you were pretty close to the place where she fell from.

42
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:01,137
No. I was here till before 1 pm,

43
00:04:01,137 --> 00:04:03,637
when I promised to have lunch with everyone.

44
00:04:03,637 --> 00:04:04,937
I didn't hear her voice at all.

45
00:04:06,837 --> 00:04:11,237
I was absorbed in making this and the blizzard was pretty bad.

46
00:04:11,237 --> 00:04:12,537
The wind was howling loudly, too.

47
00:04:14,537 --> 00:04:17,937
And I've been bothered about something for a while.

48
00:04:17,937 --> 00:04:20,137
What's this?

49
00:04:20,137 --> 00:04:21,237
A snowman.

50
00:04:21,237 --> 00:04:22,537
But the thing is,

51
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:26,137
Itabashi is the only one who knows how close it is to being finished.

52
00:04:26,137 --> 00:04:28,737
Because the blueprint's in his head.

53
00:04:28,737 --> 00:04:30,637
A snowman?

54
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,537
Well, even I can tell that it's incomplete.

55
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:35,037
Because, look,

56
00:04:35,037 --> 00:04:37,337
there are apples, bananas and oranges over there.

57
00:04:37,337 --> 00:04:39,937
You guys were gonna use these later, right?

58
00:04:39,937 --> 00:04:41,137
You're wrong.

59
00:04:42,037 --> 00:04:44,537
Those are for our snowman.

60
00:04:44,537 --> 00:04:47,037
The head fell off because of the blizzard.

61
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,237
What?

62
00:04:49,237 --> 00:04:50,237
Is that right?

63
00:04:52,937 --> 00:04:54,337
I see.

64
00:04:55,937 --> 00:04:57,537
Hey, hold up!

65
00:04:57,537 --> 00:04:59,637
Don't step on that place too much

66
00:04:59,637 --> 00:05:01,537
because the detective badges are buried there.

67
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:03,537
Oh, I'm sorry.

68
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:05,137
How nostalgic.

69
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:06,837
I used to do this when I was a child, too.

70
00:05:06,837 --> 00:05:09,237
Putting gloves on the tip of a stalk.

71
00:05:13,237 --> 00:05:14,237
Not again!

72
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:21,337
Hey, are you all right?

73
00:05:24,037 --> 00:05:25,037
Genta!

74
00:05:26,037 --> 00:05:27,037
Genta!

75
00:05:28,437 --> 00:05:30,037
Is something coming out?

76
00:05:31,937 --> 00:05:33,037
Genta.

77
00:05:33,037 --> 00:05:34,037
-You've got a nose bleed. -You've got a nose bleed.

78
00:05:34,037 --> 00:05:35,637
-A nose bleed. -A nose bleed.

79
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,437
Gosh, don't move.

80
00:05:40,437 --> 00:05:42,037
Here.

81
00:05:42,037 --> 00:05:43,337
All finished.

82
00:05:44,737 --> 00:05:49,337
All you've got to do is stay still for a while, okay?

83
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:51,437
Okay.

84
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:56,037
Ai, you're fantastic! Just like a nurse!

85
00:05:56,037 --> 00:05:58,037
Talk about unlucky.

86
00:05:59,037 --> 00:06:02,237
No. I envy you, Genta!

87
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:05,237
But I can't believe you got a nosebleed from falling on snow.

88
00:06:05,237 --> 00:06:08,237
I guess something must have been buried under there.

89
00:06:09,337 --> 00:06:11,737
There was nothing like that buried.

90
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:13,937
But it tasted sort of funny.

91
00:06:13,937 --> 00:06:15,237
Tasted funny?

92
00:06:15,237 --> 00:06:16,437
Funny taste?

93
00:06:16,437 --> 00:06:18,237
-The snow? -Yeah.

94
00:06:18,237 --> 00:06:21,037
Hey, Genta. How did it taste?

95
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:23,337
The snow. How did that snow taste?

96
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:28,037
It was salty.

97
00:06:29,537 --> 00:06:30,937
That's...

98
00:06:33,637 --> 00:06:35,037
Doc.

99
00:06:35,037 --> 00:06:36,537
Did you get anything?

100
00:06:37,537 --> 00:06:38,537
Yeah.

101
00:06:38,537 --> 00:06:42,637
The autopsy revealed that the same water from the lake

102
00:06:42,637 --> 00:06:46,237
was found in Sakuko's stomach.

103
00:06:46,237 --> 00:06:49,437
That means that this is an accident after all, right?

104
00:06:49,437 --> 00:06:51,137
No.

105
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:53,037
Maybe that's something

106
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,937
that'll back up the fact that this is a homicide case.

107
00:06:55,937 --> 00:06:59,737
It could be the ski trails that the culprit left behind.

108
00:07:01,737 --> 00:07:03,237
Yes, that's right.

109
00:07:03,237 --> 00:07:05,937
Although some doubts still remain.

110
00:07:05,937 --> 00:07:08,437
I guess this is an accident.

111
00:07:08,437 --> 00:07:11,837
I want to rush back to the station and...

112
00:07:11,837 --> 00:07:15,437
What? You're treating everyone to a Japanese nabe dish today?

113
00:07:15,437 --> 00:07:17,637
That sounds just great!

114
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,637
Please count me in on that seat that's not taken yet.

115
00:07:20,637 --> 00:07:21,837
What?

116
00:07:21,837 --> 00:07:26,537
But if there are unclear points, I should investigate more?

117
00:07:26,537 --> 00:07:28,437
The percentage of this being a homicide is zero!

118
00:07:28,437 --> 00:07:30,837
It is 120% an accident.

119
00:07:30,837 --> 00:07:32,737
-No. -So...

120
00:07:32,737 --> 00:07:33,737
Huh?

121
00:07:33,737 --> 00:07:36,337
It may not necessarily be a plain accident.

122
00:07:40,637 --> 00:07:43,637
Hey, hey. Just what's going on, officer?

123
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:45,737
I mean you called us all the way out here.

124
00:07:45,737 --> 00:07:49,737
We've already told you everything we know.

125
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:52,737
Sakuko died of an accident, didn't she?

126
00:07:52,737 --> 00:07:56,737
Yes, but he said something strange.

127
00:07:59,237 --> 00:08:02,537
No, no. It's nothing strange.

128
00:08:02,537 --> 00:08:04,637
The old man with the children.

129
00:08:04,637 --> 00:08:08,437
Sakuko did not die of an accident, but was killed.

130
00:08:08,437 --> 00:08:10,737
Moreover, the culprit is...

131
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:13,737
among you three.

132
00:08:13,737 --> 00:08:15,037
That's what I'm saying.

133
00:08:18,437 --> 00:08:20,337
Huh?

134
00:08:27,765 --> 00:08:28,965
Excuse me.

135
00:08:28,965 --> 00:08:34,765
I brought them here since I thought you found a new clue to the accident.

136
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,365
But you went and act like a detective saying that this is a homicide case.

137
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:40,365
No.

138
00:08:40,365 --> 00:08:42,265
Judging from the circumstances back then,

139
00:08:42,265 --> 00:08:43,865
it seems only plausible that Sakuko went out into the blizzard

140
00:08:43,865 --> 00:08:47,365
and fell over with her snowboard from the place where the broken fence is.

141
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:52,565
Due to snowstorm, she drowned to death in the lake.

142
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:57,165
The only road to get to the bridge that leads to the lake was blocked off.

143
00:08:57,165 --> 00:09:01,665
Not until the police got here.

144
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:03,865
Oh, that's why...

145
00:09:03,865 --> 00:09:08,665
Moreover, there are about 10 meters from the edge of the cliff to the lake.

146
00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:11,565
So even if someone were to push her down from the cliff,

147
00:09:11,565 --> 00:09:13,965
she wouldn't have been able to fall into the lake.

148
00:09:13,965 --> 00:09:18,265
And then, there's one last thing.

149
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:21,265
An hour after they parted with Sakuko,

150
00:09:21,265 --> 00:09:24,165
the three realized that she didn't show up at the promised time,

151
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:28,265
so they were looking around for her together all the way,

152
00:09:28,265 --> 00:09:31,565
all the way until her dead body was found.

153
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:34,865
Let's say that even if a rope were used,

154
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:35,965
it would've been impossible for the culprit

155
00:09:35,965 --> 00:09:39,165
to carry her on his back down the cliff to the lake and bury her,

156
00:09:39,165 --> 00:09:41,465
then climb back up again.

157
00:09:41,465 --> 00:09:46,665
You can't be telling me that any of them could possibly...

158
00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:48,965
Come on...

159
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:52,965
Hey.

160
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:55,565
Sorry. I figured it'd be faster this way.

161
00:09:56,665 --> 00:09:58,465
Officer?

162
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,265
Hey, are you all right?

163
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:02,065
He looks to be asleep.

164
00:10:02,065 --> 00:10:03,565
True.

165
00:10:03,565 --> 00:10:05,965
No, no. I'm not sleeping.

166
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:09,165
I'm so upset at myself that I went weak in the legs.

167
00:10:11,065 --> 00:10:13,465
I guess that's how it is.

168
00:10:13,465 --> 00:10:18,065
I couldn't figure out a simple trick like this until now.

169
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:20,365
Trick?

170
00:10:20,365 --> 00:10:21,465
That's right.

171
00:10:21,465 --> 00:10:25,165
The culprit put Sakuko in a certain container,

172
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:28,765
then pushed it over the cliff.

173
00:10:28,765 --> 00:10:30,565
Certain container?

174
00:10:30,565 --> 00:10:35,165
Hey, don't tell me that she was put in a sleigh or something?

175
00:10:35,165 --> 00:10:38,065
Even if she were put in a sleigh,

176
00:10:38,065 --> 00:10:42,565
I think she would fall off balance on a bumpy slope like this.

177
00:10:42,565 --> 00:10:47,165
Besides, even if someone ride it down together with her,

178
00:10:47,165 --> 00:10:50,365
that person would have to climb that cliff anyway.

179
00:10:50,365 --> 00:10:54,265
Sleigh? Nothing unstable like that was used.

180
00:10:54,265 --> 00:10:57,565
The thing I'm referring to is something that she was put inside

181
00:10:57,565 --> 00:10:59,565
that would definitely land into the lake

182
00:10:59,565 --> 00:11:03,065
and will disappear after a while.

183
00:11:03,065 --> 00:11:04,865
Land?

184
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:05,865
Then disappear?

185
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:08,665
Ridiculous.

186
00:11:08,665 --> 00:11:11,365
Nothing that convenient exists.

187
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:13,165
I see.

188
00:11:13,165 --> 00:11:15,165
But instead of beating around the bush

189
00:11:15,165 --> 00:11:17,265
and saying that it landed and disappeared,

190
00:11:17,265 --> 00:11:20,665
a better explanation would be that it rolled down and melted.

191
00:11:20,665 --> 00:11:23,165
It's easier to understand by putting it that way, don't you think?

192
00:11:24,365 --> 00:11:25,965
I see.

193
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:26,965
What?

194
00:11:26,965 --> 00:11:30,665
Remember? We were making it together yesterday.

195
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,565
We made it?

196
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:34,865
I see!

197
00:11:34,865 --> 00:11:36,665
We made it together?

198
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:41,365
Yes, I'm sure he's referring to...

199
00:11:41,365 --> 00:11:43,065
The snowman!

200
00:11:45,865 --> 00:11:50,765
If the lady was put inside the snowman and pushed over...

201
00:11:50,765 --> 00:11:54,865
It would simply roll down the cliff and fall right into the lake.

202
00:11:54,865 --> 00:12:00,365
The snowman would melt and Sakuko would be found floating in the lake.

203
00:12:00,365 --> 00:12:03,165
It seems that lake is a hot spring

204
00:12:03,165 --> 00:12:06,065
and the water temperature is a bit high.

205
00:12:06,065 --> 00:12:07,765
Snowman?

206
00:12:07,765 --> 00:12:09,265
Don't be ridiculous.

207
00:12:09,265 --> 00:12:10,365
Huh?

208
00:12:10,365 --> 00:12:13,065
I know Sakuko was pretty small,

209
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,965
but I doubt you'd be able to fit a normal sized person in a snowball.

210
00:12:16,965 --> 00:12:22,065
It would break apart before reaching the lake.

211
00:12:22,065 --> 00:12:23,465
I guess so.

212
00:12:23,465 --> 00:12:26,265
The snowman would at least have to have a diameter of about two meters.

213
00:12:26,265 --> 00:12:30,565
But even if such a large snowman were made,

214
00:12:30,565 --> 00:12:33,065
I think it'd be impossible to roll it down the cliff alone.

215
00:12:33,065 --> 00:12:36,465
No, it doesn't have to be that large.

216
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:37,465
Huh?

217
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,465
Yes.

218
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:42,165
The size only needs be as big as the one I'm leaning against.

219
00:12:42,165 --> 00:12:44,165
Leaning against?

220
00:12:44,165 --> 00:12:46,865
A snowman about this size would suffice.

221
00:12:48,665 --> 00:12:50,465
Like I just said,

222
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:53,465
something that size would fall to pieces half way

223
00:12:53,465 --> 00:12:56,465
and the contents would come out before reaching the lake.

224
00:12:56,465 --> 00:12:58,165
That sounds right.

225
00:12:58,165 --> 00:12:59,965
Hey, say something.

226
00:13:04,465 --> 00:13:05,965
Hey!

227
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:06,965
Shoots!

228
00:13:07,965 --> 00:13:09,665
What's wrong?

229
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:11,365
What's with him?

230
00:13:11,365 --> 00:13:13,765
Hey, are you trying to be funny?

231
00:13:13,765 --> 00:13:15,265
No.

232
00:13:15,265 --> 00:13:18,065
I just wanted to remind you.

233
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:21,765
About the time that Genta fell near this snowman

234
00:13:21,765 --> 00:13:24,265
and had a nose bleed.

235
00:13:26,165 --> 00:13:27,165
Genta!

236
00:13:28,565 --> 00:13:29,965
Is something coming out?

237
00:13:31,965 --> 00:13:33,065
Genta!

238
00:13:33,065 --> 00:13:34,065
-You've got a nose bleed. -You've got a nose bleed.

239
00:13:34,065 --> 00:13:35,765
-A nose bleed. -A nose bleed.

240
00:13:38,465 --> 00:13:40,065
So what about it?

241
00:13:40,065 --> 00:13:43,665
Genta, do you remember something about that snowman back then?

242
00:13:43,665 --> 00:13:45,565
Yeah.

243
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:48,865
It was hard and salty.

244
00:13:48,865 --> 00:13:50,065
That's right.

245
00:13:50,065 --> 00:13:52,465
That's the vital point of this trick.

246
00:13:54,265 --> 00:13:55,465
Salt.

247
00:13:56,765 --> 00:13:58,965
Well, am I right?

248
00:13:58,965 --> 00:14:00,265
I see.

249
00:14:00,265 --> 00:14:03,865
He used the chemical reaction of salt to harden the snowman.

250
00:14:03,865 --> 00:14:05,965
Chemical reaction?

251
00:14:05,965 --> 00:14:08,865
When salt is poured onto snow, the freezing point,

252
00:14:08,865 --> 00:14:11,065
the temperature will drastically drop,

253
00:14:11,065 --> 00:14:13,865
and the part that salt was poured onto would melt.

254
00:14:13,865 --> 00:14:16,865
But before melting, it absorbs the heat from its surroundings,

255
00:14:16,865 --> 00:14:18,965
so the snow around the area where the salt is not poured onto

256
00:14:18,965 --> 00:14:20,765
freezes and becomes hard.

257
00:14:22,665 --> 00:14:25,065
This method is commonly used at ski race courses

258
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:29,565
or when hardening igloos.

259
00:14:29,565 --> 00:14:31,665
But at ski courses,

260
00:14:31,665 --> 00:14:33,265
they would normally use sulphate ammonium

261
00:14:33,265 --> 00:14:36,565
to prevent damage after the snow melts.

262
00:14:36,565 --> 00:14:42,465
Sulphate ammonium?

263
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,165
Well, I guess when you get older,

264
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:47,465
you'll learn about it in home economics cooking class.

265
00:14:47,465 --> 00:14:49,065
Hey, hey.

266
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:50,965
All of this means nothing.

267
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:54,765
But where was that snowman that was hardened using salt?

268
00:14:54,765 --> 00:14:56,465
Are you saying you saw it?

269
00:14:56,465 --> 00:15:00,265
I didn't see it, but it probably was done here.

270
00:15:00,265 --> 00:15:02,265
Right at this snowman near me.

271
00:15:04,465 --> 00:15:07,865
Since the snowman was hardened here using salt,

272
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:11,365
the snow that accumulated on the ground also hardened.

273
00:15:11,365 --> 00:15:14,665
That's why Genta had a nose bleed when he fell.

274
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:16,365
Huh?

275
00:15:16,365 --> 00:15:19,265
Was done here? Isn't it still there?

276
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:23,465
This is the one the culprit made in haste after he committed the murder,

277
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:25,965
so that no one would see through the snowman trick.

278
00:15:25,965 --> 00:15:29,365
He remade the torso only.

279
00:15:29,365 --> 00:15:30,965
As proof of that...

280
00:15:30,965 --> 00:15:32,165
Look.

281
00:15:35,665 --> 00:15:38,365
The head is also hardened with salt, isn't it?

282
00:15:39,665 --> 00:15:41,465
As long as the shape doesn't collapse,

283
00:15:41,465 --> 00:15:45,365
all he has to do is put the head back on the torso.

284
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:47,165
Wait a second.

285
00:15:47,165 --> 00:15:48,265
Then...

286
00:15:48,265 --> 00:15:52,265
Don't tell me the one who put Sakuko in the snowman and dropped her is...

287
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:53,365
That's right.

288
00:15:53,365 --> 00:15:55,665
The person who was making a snowman the entire time,

289
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:57,065
Mr. Itabashi!

290
00:15:57,065 --> 00:16:00,565
There's no one else but you who could've done it!

291
00:16:01,865 --> 00:16:04,865
Although it only required him to put the head back onto the torso,

292
00:16:04,865 --> 00:16:07,865
revisions on the detailed form where the head and torso are joined

293
00:16:07,865 --> 00:16:11,265
can only be done by Mr. Itabashi who made it.

294
00:16:13,565 --> 00:16:16,965
After Sakuko parted with everyone, Mr. Itabashi most probably

295
00:16:16,965 --> 00:16:19,565
used the blizzard to his advantage and called her outside.

296
00:16:19,565 --> 00:16:22,565
He did so, because he wanted her to come out wearing her gear.

297
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,565
When she came outside, he probably said to her,

298
00:16:25,565 --> 00:16:30,565
"Let's go back to the room and talk because the blizzard is bad."

299
00:16:30,565 --> 00:16:32,865
He then lured her to his room.

300
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:43,965
You pushed her face down into the wash basin that was filled with water.

301
00:16:47,665 --> 00:16:50,065
And drowned her.

302
00:16:50,065 --> 00:16:52,665
Then in the blizzard where the vision was unclear,

303
00:16:52,665 --> 00:16:56,565
you carried her after putting the snowboard boots on her.

304
00:16:56,565 --> 00:17:00,765
You put her and her snowboard inside the torso of the snowman

305
00:17:00,765 --> 00:17:03,965
where you had made a hollow space in.

306
00:17:03,965 --> 00:17:06,665
You covered it with a lid made of snow.

307
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:08,465
You rolled the snowman...

308
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:11,265
to the cliff...

309
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,665
and dropped it.

310
00:17:25,765 --> 00:17:31,065
You finally succeeded in making her float in the water.

311
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:34,565
But can you do all that in just an hour?

312
00:17:34,565 --> 00:17:37,665
After he dropped the snowman with Sakuko inside it,

313
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:40,765
he made the torso of the snowman, right?

314
00:17:40,765 --> 00:17:43,065
When Itabashi came to meet with us,

315
00:17:43,065 --> 00:17:45,565
he wasn't breathing hard or anything.

316
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:50,565
It's true that he'd be tired if he made something this size in an hour,

317
00:17:50,565 --> 00:17:52,965
but if he used something that was already half made,

318
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:55,865
only half the time and labour are required.

319
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:56,965
Half?

320
00:17:56,965 --> 00:17:59,465
You people probably didn't know,

321
00:17:59,465 --> 00:18:06,065
but in order to surprise you, the children did something to their snowman.

322
00:18:06,065 --> 00:18:07,465
Isn't that right, you guys?

323
00:18:07,465 --> 00:18:09,165
Huh? Yes.

324
00:18:09,165 --> 00:18:11,965
We did it to surprise you by letting out voices

325
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,365
when you came here next time.

326
00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:17,865
We did something to our snowman's head.

327
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:19,565
We put our detective badges into the head part.

328
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:20,665
Huh?

329
00:18:25,565 --> 00:18:27,565
Huh? That's the sound of the detective badge.

330
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,965
The sound's coming from the stomach of the snowman.

331
00:18:29,965 --> 00:18:33,265
Which means, the head of our snowman didn't fall off

332
00:18:33,265 --> 00:18:35,765
because of the blizzard.

333
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:39,765
After Mr. Itabashi removed the fruit parts,

334
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:43,665
he used that as a base to make the torso of the snowman.

335
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:49,365
But that doesn't serve as proof to brand Itabashi as the culprit.

336
00:18:49,365 --> 00:18:52,765
The evidence is the wash basin in Mr. Itabashi's room.

337
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:56,865
The autopsy revealed that the water found in Sakuko's stomach

338
00:18:56,865 --> 00:18:59,765
was the same as the water of the lake below the cliff.

339
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:04,065
So it's most likely that the evidence is still there,

340
00:19:04,065 --> 00:19:09,465
the water that Mr. Itabashi brought from the lake in order to drown her.

341
00:19:09,465 --> 00:19:12,565
And her hair may also be found with it, too.

342
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:16,165
It could be the wash basin in her room,

343
00:19:16,165 --> 00:19:19,865
but I'm sure that Mr. Itabashi used his own room to commit the murder.

344
00:19:19,865 --> 00:19:21,765
If he used her room,

345
00:19:21,765 --> 00:19:25,265
he would've probably brought her goggles, gloves and cap along

346
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:28,465
and put them on her before putting her into the snowman.

347
00:19:29,765 --> 00:19:31,165
But...

348
00:19:31,165 --> 00:19:33,965
Itabashi had no reason to kill her!

349
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,065
Yeah.

350
00:19:36,665 --> 00:19:40,865
I didn't think I'd end up doing what I did either.

351
00:19:40,865 --> 00:19:42,865
But when Asaka came into the picture,

352
00:19:42,865 --> 00:19:45,865
I guess I lost my mind for an instant.

353
00:19:45,865 --> 00:19:46,865
Huh?

354
00:19:48,165 --> 00:19:49,165
Just what do you mean?

355
00:19:50,765 --> 00:19:51,765
Itabashi!

356
00:19:53,365 --> 00:19:55,065
You knew, didn't you?

357
00:19:55,065 --> 00:19:58,465
That Sakuko was in love with you.

358
00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:01,065
And you're in love with Asaka.

359
00:20:01,065 --> 00:20:04,065
You like the way she gracefully used to ski around the ski slopes.

360
00:20:07,465 --> 00:20:10,965
In order to erase Asaka's gracefulness from your heart,

361
00:20:10,965 --> 00:20:12,765
that woman

362
00:20:12,765 --> 00:20:16,265
made Asaka wear snowboard boots that she wasn't experienced with yet,

363
00:20:16,265 --> 00:20:18,765
lured her to a dangerous course where she got into an accident

364
00:20:18,765 --> 00:20:21,465
and took Asaka's leg away from her.

365
00:20:21,465 --> 00:20:23,365
All for such a stupid reason.

366
00:20:24,365 --> 00:20:25,865
Hey, are you serious?

367
00:20:25,865 --> 00:20:29,565
Yeah, she was muttering about it when she was drunk once.

368
00:20:30,565 --> 00:20:34,065
Hey, you're drinking too much.

369
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:36,665
This is all Asaka's fault.

370
00:20:36,665 --> 00:20:40,065
Hey, just what do you mean by that?

371
00:20:40,065 --> 00:20:42,665
Everything worked out up to the time I lured her out

372
00:20:42,665 --> 00:20:46,365
and she broke her leg like I expected her to.

373
00:20:46,365 --> 00:20:48,865
But why hasn't she disappeared yet?

374
00:20:48,865 --> 00:20:50,565
That Asaka.

375
00:20:53,165 --> 00:20:54,265
What'd you say?

376
00:20:56,165 --> 00:20:58,065
It's so sickening, really.

377
00:20:58,065 --> 00:21:02,265
The doctor told her that she wouldn't be able to ski again and yet...

378
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:06,865
No way.

379
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,065
Itabashi!

380
00:21:08,065 --> 00:21:09,365
Why?

381
00:21:09,365 --> 00:21:11,865
Why didn't you tell me about it?

382
00:21:14,765 --> 00:21:16,565
Itabashi!

383
00:21:19,765 --> 00:21:25,265
I can't do something like sending salt to an enemy.

384
00:21:25,265 --> 00:21:27,465
-Enemy? -Yeah.

385
00:21:27,465 --> 00:21:30,065
Knowing your character, if you found out about it,

386
00:21:30,065 --> 00:21:32,865
who knows what you would've done to Sakuko.

387
00:21:32,865 --> 00:21:34,865
I just couldn't stand giving it away to you.

388
00:21:37,865 --> 00:21:41,865
The role of taking Asaka's enemy away and take the blow.

389
00:21:43,165 --> 00:21:45,765
I didn't want to give away this crazy role to you.

390
00:23:17,365 --> 00:23:19,165
But it sure was a surprise.

391
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:22,165
Putting salt on the snow hardens it.

392
00:23:22,165 --> 00:23:23,665
-Right? -Nope,

393
00:23:23,665 --> 00:23:26,065
it not only just hardens it.

394
00:23:26,065 --> 00:23:28,865
If you sprinkle salt on snow and mix them,

395
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:31,965
it breaks down and continues to melt.

396
00:23:31,965 --> 00:23:34,665
Eventually, the salt disappears.

397
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:38,365
Calcium chloride is used in the same way on snowy streets

398
00:23:38,365 --> 00:23:40,065
to help melt the snow.

399
00:23:41,565 --> 00:23:43,165
That's right.

400
00:23:43,165 --> 00:23:45,365
He used it in the wrong way.

401
00:23:46,365 --> 00:23:47,565
The salt.

402
00:23:48,965 --> 00:23:50,665
He used salt in the wrong way.

403
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:54,865
He didn't melt and dissolve his intention to kill,

404
00:23:54,865 --> 00:23:56,565
but rather, solidified it.

405
00:24:46,665 --> 00:24:48,865
Next Conan's Hint:

406
00:24:48,865 --> 00:24:50,865
"X-Ray"

407
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,365
The next episode is a story about a turtle.

408
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:53,565
A super vicious one, too!

409
00:24:53,565 --> 00:24:54,865
I'm scared.
