1
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:09,989
-Bull's Eye! -Strike!

2
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:11,991
Awesome!

3
00:00:18,521 --> 00:00:21,421
It feels kind of uncomfortable being invited

4
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:24,521
to the client's birthday party

5
00:00:24,521 --> 00:00:26,821
when the case isn't solved yet.

6
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:28,421
What're you talking about?

7
00:00:28,421 --> 00:00:30,321
You were the one who was all excited

8
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,921
saying that Asako from Strawberry invited you to come!

9
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:36,015
After all, they're one of the most popular

10
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:37,521
comedian couple around now.

11
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:41,621
"Jiro Imaoka, Asako Fujimori" -Strawberries taste of love.

12
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:46,421
"Fujimori"

13
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,521
I'm Mouri.

14
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:50,421
Thank you for inviting us over tonight.

15
00:00:58,221 --> 00:01:01,221
What's the matter, Asako?

16
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:05,021
A man suddenly broke in from the veranda and I...

17
00:01:06,221 --> 00:01:07,621
Asako!

18
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:09,321
Hey, Conan!

19
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:20,421
Zombie?

20
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:24,063
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

21
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:26,065
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

22
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:28,067
A popular man and woman comedian.

23
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,621
The key to this difficult case is strawberry.

24
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:32,071
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:32,321 --> 00:01:34,073
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:36,421
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

27
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:23,031
"The Night the Zombie Died"

28
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:24,531
"Mouri Detective Agency"

29
00:03:24,531 --> 00:03:27,331
It all started a week ago.

30
00:03:27,331 --> 00:03:28,631
Ms. Asako Fujimori of the popular man and woman

31
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:30,931
comedian couple, Strawberry,

32
00:03:30,931 --> 00:03:34,193
came to the Mouri Detective Agency asking to have a job done.

33
00:03:34,193 --> 00:03:36,195
Keisuke Numata?

34
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:38,197
He's a man I used to go out with

35
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:42,201
about 15 years ago when I first came to Tokyo.

36
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:44,631
He didn't have a good personality,

37
00:03:44,631 --> 00:03:48,531
so I parted with him right away though.

38
00:03:48,531 --> 00:03:52,211
The moment that Strawberry won the Spring Comedian Grand Prix

39
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:54,231
and your popularity started to grow!

40
00:03:54,231 --> 00:03:57,631
I got repeated calls from asking to lend him money.

41
00:03:57,631 --> 00:04:00,931
I refused and he started giving me a bad time.

42
00:04:00,931 --> 00:04:02,221
Started giving you a bad time?

43
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:04,931
My mailbox was messed up.

44
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:08,831
When I walk the streets at night, I feel like someone is following me.

45
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:09,831
The other day,

46
00:04:09,831 --> 00:04:13,031
I found marks on the front door attempting to be forced opened.

47
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:18,931
Your pendant is cute.

48
00:04:18,931 --> 00:04:20,931
This is a medicine case.

49
00:04:20,931 --> 00:04:23,631
-Medicine case? -Yes.

50
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:27,131
I've had a weak heart since I was a child.

51
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:31,331
So I always keep medicine in here and carry it around with me.

52
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:32,731
Unforgivable.

53
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:36,731
Targeting such a fragile woman.

54
00:04:38,031 --> 00:04:39,631
I see.

55
00:04:39,631 --> 00:04:43,831
So, she asked you to look for that guy called Numata?

56
00:04:43,831 --> 00:04:46,265
Yes, sir. I checked everywhere,

57
00:04:46,265 --> 00:04:48,267
but I still can't come up with where he is.

58
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:50,269
To start with, I told her to change the lock

59
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:54,031
that is hard to do picking on.

60
00:04:54,031 --> 00:04:56,531
I think that Numata found out about this,

61
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:59,031
and decided to force himself in.

62
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:04,931
Asako, your left arm is bruised.

63
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:07,531
That guy grabbed me.

64
00:05:11,031 --> 00:05:13,031
Asako.

65
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:14,293
"Minoru Hisamatsu (60)" -You really surprised me, really.

66
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:17,331
-Are you all right? -Mr. Hisamatsu!

67
00:05:17,331 --> 00:05:20,299
Mr. Hisamatsu, Strawberry's manager.

68
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:21,731
Why on earth...

69
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:25,631
A man suddenly came in with a pistol.

70
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,031
I got desperate and...

71
00:05:29,031 --> 00:05:30,631
Take off his mask.

72
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,031
Yes, sir!

73
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,531
No? It can't be!

74
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:43,631
Jiro!

75
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:50,331
Why? Why, Jiro?

76
00:05:50,331 --> 00:05:51,931
Jiro!

77
00:05:53,931 --> 00:05:56,031
It's a model gun.

78
00:05:56,031 --> 00:06:00,931
Can you give us the details of when Jiro came inside?

79
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,631
Yes, sir.

80
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:04,931
Today's my birthday.

81
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:08,347
I invited him to come at 7:00 pm to have dinner

82
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:10,331
with Mr. Mouri who has been looking after me.

83
00:06:10,331 --> 00:06:13,131
Hamburger, right?

84
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:14,353
What's this?

85
00:06:14,531 --> 00:06:16,355
It's fruit punch.

86
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:18,357
I made it for dessert.

87
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:20,731
It was when I was cutting strawberries...

88
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:26,365
I heard glass crack.

89
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:39,431
I'm going to kill you!

90
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:41,131
No!

91
00:06:41,131 --> 00:06:44,383
-No! -Stay still!

92
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:46,031
You're Numata, aren't you?

93
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,231
Shut up!

94
00:06:47,231 --> 00:06:49,231
No!

95
00:07:03,931 --> 00:07:08,407
That's when Mr. Mouri and the others arrived.

96
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:10,409
You should cool it.

97
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:11,731
Thank you.

98
00:07:15,731 --> 00:07:18,131
Inspector! According to the calls received record,

99
00:07:18,131 --> 00:07:21,731
the victim before breaking in here at about 6:45 pm,

100
00:07:21,731 --> 00:07:23,431
made a call somewhere!

101
00:07:24,731 --> 00:07:26,425
K?

102
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:29,531
Check out who it is right away.

103
00:07:29,531 --> 00:07:30,831
Yes, sir!

104
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:35,531
Didn't you invite Jiro to come today?

105
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:39,031
He told me that he had to meet somebody today.

106
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:42,031
Why did Jiro do something like this?

107
00:07:42,031 --> 00:07:45,031
-Do you have any idea? -No.

108
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:48,431
Mr. Hisamatsu, how about you?

109
00:07:48,431 --> 00:07:50,831
Well...

110
00:07:50,831 --> 00:07:56,231
Jiro was trying to quit being a pair with Asako!

111
00:07:56,231 --> 00:07:58,457
-What? -What?

112
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:00,831
What? It can't be...

113
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:02,831
Jiro entered the world of comedy

114
00:08:02,831 --> 00:08:04,831
right after graduating from high school.

115
00:08:04,831 --> 00:08:06,031
Although he had good looks,

116
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:07,331
he didn't have guts going on stage.

117
00:08:07,331 --> 00:08:09,931
So things didn't work out.

118
00:08:09,931 --> 00:08:13,331
Asako insisted that Jiro had talent,

119
00:08:13,331 --> 00:08:15,031
aggressively established being a pair with him

120
00:08:15,031 --> 00:08:16,731
and after 10 years of hard work,

121
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:19,631
everything starting to bloom.

122
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:23,431
Being busy worsened Asako's heart condition.

123
00:08:23,431 --> 00:08:25,231
She began to take off from stage performances and TV,

124
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:28,231
or her reaction during their act would be delayed.

125
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:31,931
It seems that Jiro couldn't tolerate that.

126
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:34,493
Come to think of it, I too,

127
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:36,495
during the time I was guarding Asako...

128
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:39,331
-Jiro! -Hi, Jiro!

129
00:08:39,331 --> 00:08:41,831
"Strawbery" -Well, it was really good!

130
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:44,503
No! No good!

131
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:46,831
You didn't react on time, three times!

132
00:08:46,831 --> 00:08:48,507
Just what do you think you're doing?

133
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:52,511
I'm sorry, my heart wasn't feeling right.

134
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:54,131
Who cares?

135
00:08:54,131 --> 00:08:55,631
We're professionals, you know?

136
00:08:55,631 --> 00:08:56,931
Come now...

137
00:08:56,931 --> 00:08:59,731
Asako has a lot on her mind too and is tired.

138
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:01,831
I can't go on like this anymore.

139
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:03,631
Hurry on up and quit already!

140
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:11,131
-Did he tell her to quit? -Yes, sir.

141
00:09:11,131 --> 00:09:12,531
Come to think of it,

142
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:15,631
I've seen a lot about it in the weekly magazines and stuff.

143
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:18,031
Oh, here.

144
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:20,031
"Get together party with girl announcers"?

145
00:09:20,031 --> 00:09:22,031
"Dating idols"?

146
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:25,031
It seems he was pretty open about going out with women.

147
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:29,831
Asako and Jiro were not only comedy pairs,

148
00:09:29,831 --> 00:09:32,031
but were they were also lovers.

149
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:35,431
Yet, as soon as they started getting popular, Jiro...

150
00:09:35,431 --> 00:09:37,931
Not being able to tolerate it any longer,

151
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:40,559
I too, warned Jiro about his actions.

152
00:09:40,731 --> 00:09:43,231
That's when he said...

153
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:44,831
Dissolve being a pair?

154
00:09:44,831 --> 00:09:49,231
Yeah, with Asako the way she is, we can't possibly continue, right?

155
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:52,331
I've had enough of being held back by her!

156
00:09:52,331 --> 00:09:54,573
After all Asako did for you,

157
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:56,931
how could you talk like that?

158
00:09:56,931 --> 00:10:00,231
That's a totally different story.

159
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:03,531
After dissolving being a pair, just what do you intend to do?

160
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:07,231
With my looks I could probably stand alone, don't you think?

161
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:11,131
At any rate, it's better if our ages are not so close.

162
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:13,431
You...

163
00:10:13,431 --> 00:10:17,531
Regardless, I don't want to do comedy with Asako anymore!

164
00:10:17,531 --> 00:10:19,731
Her time's up already, time to withdraw!

165
00:10:19,731 --> 00:10:23,131
Mr. Hisamatsu, tell her that she should think about retiring too!

166
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:25,131
Won't you?

167
00:10:25,131 --> 00:10:29,831
The one that helped him to get where he is now is Asako.

168
00:10:29,831 --> 00:10:34,613
Why did Jiro have so many rubber masks?

169
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:37,631
Yeah, it seems he was thinking of doing

170
00:10:37,631 --> 00:10:40,631
a one-man comedy using rubber masks.

171
00:10:40,631 --> 00:10:42,331
One-man comedy?

172
00:10:42,331 --> 00:10:46,331
Do comedy while changing masks one after the other.

173
00:10:46,331 --> 00:10:48,231
He showed me a bit of it,

174
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,531
but it wasn't anything you could laugh at

175
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:52,131
even as a flattering remark.

176
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:53,231
Inspector!

177
00:10:53,231 --> 00:10:56,331
The person the victim called has been identified!

178
00:10:56,331 --> 00:10:57,731
A locksmith!

179
00:10:57,731 --> 00:10:59,631
You mean like the one who helps you

180
00:10:59,631 --> 00:11:03,031
get the door open when you lose your key or something?

181
00:11:03,031 --> 00:11:06,131
Yes. But according to them,

182
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:08,647
the call was dropped soon after they answered.

183
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:11,631
They thought it was a wrong number.

184
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:15,931
I heard from the resident who lives on the 2nd floor here,

185
00:11:15,931 --> 00:11:20,331
just when the weather forecast was aired at around 6:50 pm,

186
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:24,331
the resident witness a man climbing up the veranda to her room.

187
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:25,631
No mistake about it?

188
00:11:25,631 --> 00:11:27,531
No, because the witness said

189
00:11:27,531 --> 00:11:31,831
he had seen the victim and Asako practicing in the park many times.

190
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:33,531
So, no mistake about it.

191
00:11:33,531 --> 00:11:36,675
You mean he wasn't wearing the zombie mask at that time?

192
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:38,677
What? Yes.

193
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:42,231
Which means he put the mask on after he got to the veranda.

194
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:49,331
A piece of glass?

195
00:11:49,331 --> 00:11:50,689
What's up?

196
00:11:58,331 --> 00:11:59,731
Hey!

197
00:11:59,731 --> 00:12:02,431
Kids stay in the corner and stay put!

198
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,705
Hey, there's something on the hem of Jiro's pants!

199
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:08,031
What?

200
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:10,131
It's cocklebur, isn't it?

201
00:12:10,131 --> 00:12:13,831
That stuff can get stuck anywhere, can't it?

202
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:16,331
It hurts.

203
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:19,931
Asako, did you go out somewhere today?

204
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:23,831
No, I was in the room all day today.

205
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:25,031
But...

206
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:30,729
Inspector! Regarding the truth of this case,

207
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:32,431
I, the famed Kogoro Mouri,

208
00:12:32,431 --> 00:12:34,431
has figured it out!

209
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:44,743
"Strawberries taste of love" -As his popularity grew,

210
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:48,747
people started pampering him and Asako was in the way.

211
00:12:48,925 --> 00:12:54,025
But, if he conspicuously parts with her, it may ruin his reputation.

212
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:56,755
Therefore, he came up with an idea.

213
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:58,125
An idea?

214
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:02,225
Asako was being stalked by a man called Numata.

215
00:13:02,225 --> 00:13:05,125
Jiro took advantage of this.

216
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,725
He would break in pretending to be Numata

217
00:13:07,725 --> 00:13:10,769
and shock Asako out of her wits.

218
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:14,773
It would certainly affect her heart, forcing her to resign!

219
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:16,025
What?

220
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:18,425
Jiro would never do something like that!

221
00:13:18,425 --> 00:13:22,781
But, if you think of it that way, everything falls into place.

222
00:13:23,025 --> 00:13:24,783
The reason Jiro put on a zombie mask

223
00:13:25,025 --> 00:13:29,825
and armed himself with a model gun, cracking the window to break in here!

224
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:33,725
It was all so that he could cut ties with you!

225
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:35,225
It can't be...

226
00:13:35,225 --> 00:13:37,625
However, Asako who resisted,

227
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,525
stabbed him with the knife she was holding.

228
00:13:39,525 --> 00:13:41,325
Inspector.

229
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:44,803
It would be more accurate to say, that the knife poked into him.

230
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:48,807
Asako had no idea that the attacker was Jiro.

231
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:50,809
That's why she resisted.

232
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:53,425
No matter how you look at it, this is a case of self-defense.

233
00:13:53,425 --> 00:13:55,125
I see.

234
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:59,725
Pops's deduction is logical and thinkable.

235
00:13:59,725 --> 00:14:00,819
But...

236
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,425
Just as I thought.

237
00:14:08,425 --> 00:14:11,825
He called the locksmith at 6:45 pm,

238
00:14:11,825 --> 00:14:16,025
and was witnessed climbing up the veranda at 6:50 pm.

239
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:17,925
Judging from the time known,

240
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:20,839
he must've called from around here.

241
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:22,125
Found it!

242
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:26,325
This cocklebur is what was on Jiro's pants.

243
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:29,125
This grassy area is so stepped on all over.

244
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:32,425
Was somebody looking for something in the grass?

245
00:14:32,425 --> 00:14:34,325
I get it!

246
00:14:34,325 --> 00:14:36,855
So, that's what it was!

247
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:40,859
Asako, I'm sorry about this unfortunate case,

248
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:44,425
but please come to the station for statement details on the incident.

249
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,125
Yes, sir.

250
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,867
Conan. Where were you?

251
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:50,325
Somewhere.

252
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,925
There...

253
00:14:58,025 --> 00:15:01,725
-Just as I thought. -What is it?

254
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:04,025
Really greedy when it comes to food.

255
00:15:05,725 --> 00:15:09,225
Cold enough to make your teeth sting, that's what's so good.

256
00:15:16,025 --> 00:15:18,525
-Shall we go, then? -Yes, sir.

257
00:15:18,525 --> 00:15:20,899
Inspector!

258
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:24,425
Will hear me out a bit longer?

259
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:26,905
You mean there's something more?

260
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:30,025
The thing I said a while ago was the exterior scenario.

261
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:34,125
The true scenario is hidden behind.

262
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,325
The scenario behind?

263
00:15:36,325 --> 00:15:40,125
Yes. The scenario that goes

264
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,921
Asako feigns killing Jiro in self-defense.

265
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:44,625
That scenario!

266
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:48,625
-What? -What're you talking about?

267
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:52,425
Asako, a man named Keisuke Numata

268
00:15:52,425 --> 00:15:54,925
doesn't exist in this world, does he?

269
00:15:54,925 --> 00:15:56,925
He does!

270
00:15:56,925 --> 00:15:59,425
I showed you his picture, didn't I?

271
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:03,425
All you had to do was pull out some old pictures,

272
00:16:03,425 --> 00:16:05,525
that would do the trick anytime.

273
00:16:05,525 --> 00:16:10,225
You made up a make-believe character named Numata,

274
00:16:10,225 --> 00:16:13,425
and showed me how terrified you were.

275
00:16:13,425 --> 00:16:14,953
You led me to think that you mistook Jiro,

276
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:16,525
the masked zombie, for Numata.

277
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:20,525
You made up a scenario of the knife mistakenly as a self-defense

278
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:22,961
and had me deduce it, likewise.

279
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:24,963
That's enough!

280
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:27,925
To begin with, if Jiro didn't wearing that zombie mask

281
00:16:27,925 --> 00:16:29,725
and break into this room,

282
00:16:29,725 --> 00:16:32,225
this wouldn't have happened!

283
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:35,625
You're the one who set it up to be this way, is it not?

284
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,725
Asako, at sundown around 6:00 pm

285
00:16:38,725 --> 00:16:42,325
you met Jiro in the park, didn't you?

286
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:46,025
No. I was here preparing dinner.

287
00:16:46,025 --> 00:16:49,325
You said you were making fruit punch.

288
00:16:49,325 --> 00:16:52,991
-Ran, taste it, will you? -What?

289
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,993
You're good at cooking, right?

290
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:57,325
So taste it and let me know what you think.

291
00:16:57,325 --> 00:16:58,425
Okay.

292
00:17:03,325 --> 00:17:06,025
How about it?

293
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,725
It's a bit too sweet and maybe a bit too cold.

294
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:11,425
I'm sure she had it in the refrigerator

295
00:17:11,425 --> 00:17:14,425
with the contents soaked in syrup.

296
00:17:14,425 --> 00:17:15,425
But, this...

297
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:19,017
Right, if she made that just before the incident occurred,

298
00:17:19,225 --> 00:17:21,019
she wouldn't have had to make it that sweet,

299
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,625
nor would it have been that cold.

300
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,023
In other words,

301
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:28,525
Asako made it part way and put it in the refrigerator.

302
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:32,325
And then, went to the park to meet Jiro.

303
00:17:32,325 --> 00:17:34,625
How can you be so sure?

304
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,125
Cocklebur.

305
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:39,037
It can be found on the hem of Jiro's pants.

306
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:45,043
It's a plant that is rarely seen in Tokyo recently,

307
00:17:45,225 --> 00:17:49,725
but there are some growing in that park over there.

308
00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:54,025
And on Asako's sneakers at the front door,

309
00:17:54,025 --> 00:17:57,055
cockleburs are also attached.

310
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:58,425
You lied to Jiro at the park

311
00:17:58,425 --> 00:18:02,425
saying that you dropped your room key.

312
00:18:02,425 --> 00:18:04,025
The cocklebur stuck onto you when you were looking

313
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:07,625
for the key together in the grass, right?

314
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,425
Jiro called the locksmith

315
00:18:10,425 --> 00:18:14,325
in order to have him open the door.

316
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:17,425
But, since they were lovers,

317
00:18:17,425 --> 00:18:20,125
Jiro also had the key to this room.

318
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,025
Just the other day, I told her to change the lock

319
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:24,325
to cope with the stalker problem.

320
00:18:24,325 --> 00:18:28,025
This was also a part of Asako's plan.

321
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:32,525
She probably hadn't given the spare key to Jiro yet.

322
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:35,725
And you went on to finish your plan.

323
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:38,225
What's wrong?

324
00:18:38,225 --> 00:18:40,025
An attack? Where's your medicine?

325
00:18:40,025 --> 00:18:43,101
I think, I forgot it in the room.

326
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:45,825
The locksmith's not going to make it here in time!

327
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:48,325
Jiro... Please...

328
00:18:48,325 --> 00:18:52,625
The window of the veranda isn't locked,

329
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,113
so can you go up the scaffold used for construction.

330
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:57,115
Really, what a nuisance!

331
00:18:59,325 --> 00:19:02,825
While Jiro was using the scaffold used for construction and climbing,

332
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:05,725
you beat him to the room by using the elevator

333
00:19:05,725 --> 00:19:09,125
and with the key that you hidden and went into the room.

334
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,925
Asako. Why?

335
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,825
And after you killed Jiro,

336
00:19:25,825 --> 00:19:28,725
you took the hamburger and fruit punch that you half made

337
00:19:28,725 --> 00:19:32,425
out of the refrigerator.

338
00:19:32,425 --> 00:19:34,425
Even if that were to be true,

339
00:19:34,425 --> 00:19:36,525
we don't have enough proof.

340
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:39,725
The bruise on Asako's left hand.

341
00:19:39,725 --> 00:19:43,425
If you grab left arm of a person you're confronting with your left hand,

342
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:47,925
the mark of the thumb should be left on the outside of the arm, but...

343
00:19:47,925 --> 00:19:50,825
The direction of the bruise is opposite!

344
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:55,173
She bruised by grabbing herself firmly with her right hand.

345
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:58,625
The other is the zombie mask.

346
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,625
Please take a good look at it.

347
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,825
There are little pieces of shattered glass on the inside.

348
00:20:03,825 --> 00:20:05,725
What?

349
00:20:05,725 --> 00:20:07,185
It's true!

350
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:11,189
If Jiro broke into the room wearing the zombie mask,

351
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:15,193
glass pieces wouldn't have been found on the inside of the mask.

352
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:18,225
In other words, after she killed Jiro,

353
00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:20,425
she cracked the glass herself

354
00:20:20,425 --> 00:20:25,825
and made him wear the zombie mask after that.

355
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:29,207
And the only one who could've done that is Asako.

356
00:20:29,425 --> 00:20:32,425
You're the only one who could've done that!

357
00:20:32,425 --> 00:20:34,925
Asako.

358
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:38,825
I couldn't forgive Jiro.

359
00:20:38,825 --> 00:20:41,725
What you said a while ago, Mr. Hisamatsu,

360
00:20:41,725 --> 00:20:45,625
-I heard about it too. -What?

361
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:49,225
After you left the room, Jiro...

362
00:20:49,225 --> 00:20:54,625
Our long days as lovers have already ended!

363
00:20:55,925 --> 00:20:58,725
I'm making a new start!

364
00:21:04,425 --> 00:21:07,245
We worked so hard together.

365
00:21:07,425 --> 00:21:11,249
All our hard times just started to fruit and yet,

366
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:14,425
Jiro drank the sweet juice of that fruit alone

367
00:21:14,425 --> 00:21:16,425
and was about to leave me!

368
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:18,625
I just couldn't forgive him.

369
00:22:46,925 --> 00:22:50,325
Asako, this just arrived.

370
00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:51,625
It's for you.

371
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,925
Are you having a good time at your birthday party?

372
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:04,225
-Happy Birthday. -Happy Birthday.

373
00:23:04,225 --> 00:23:07,365
-Here's a gift for you. -Here's a gift for you, a ring.

374
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:11,125
Let's end our comedy pair relationship and going with each other.

375
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:14,125
Please marry me.

376
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:17,375
It's hard for me to tell you to quit being a comedian

377
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:19,377
but take care of your body,

378
00:23:19,377 --> 00:23:22,725
and start a new life with me.

379
00:23:22,725 --> 00:23:28,625
Strawberry will always live on in both our hearts.

380
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:33,391
This...

381
00:23:33,391 --> 00:23:35,025
This can't be...

382
00:23:35,025 --> 00:23:38,825
Jiro! I'm sorry, Jiro!

383
00:23:40,725 --> 00:23:42,925
Jiro!

384
00:23:42,925 --> 00:23:46,425
I'm sorry!

385
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:50,025
At times the hearts of people go separate ways

386
00:23:50,025 --> 00:23:52,625
and give birth to irreplaceable mistakes.

387
00:23:54,325 --> 00:23:58,925
This case was one of those sad cases.

388
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,690
Next Conan's Hint:

389
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,440
"Pickup Truck"
