1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,770
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,570
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,270
Fishing, fireworks, and a house boat.

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,270
An accident or a case

5
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,270
depending on the skill of deduction.

6
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,770
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,770
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,870
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,500
"Sayori Unabara (22), in charge of cooking and customer relation"

10
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,600
"Fukuo Unabara (50), Captain of 'Unabara Maru'"

11
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,100
"Kazuyuki Kawai (65), President of a building company"

12
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,500
Oh! There it is!

13
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,100
Unabara Maru. That's the one! That's it!

14
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,900
Welcome! The entrance is this way.

15
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,900
Well, Mr. Kawai, thank you for inviting us over tonight.

16
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,300
Same here.

17
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,500
You've been so much help to me in so many ways that it's no big deal.

18
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,900
Getting to watch the fireworks on a houseboat is so fantastic!

19
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,800
It sure is rare that they're having fireworks at this time of season.

20
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,000
Hey, come on, Conan!

21
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,800
Hi there, sorry to keep you all waiting!

22
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,700
I had a big transaction to take care of.

23
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,250
Mr. Yamazaki,

24
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,450
I'm sorry that I suddenly asked you to come

25
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,750
despite your busy schedule.

26
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,350
I've got your fishing equipment ready too.

27
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,450
"Tsuneo Yamazaki (60), President of a finance company"

28
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,450
All you can eat, all you can drink,

29
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,050
and watching fireworks too.

30
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,050
To top things off I also get to go fishing.

31
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,050
I couldn't possibly refuse.

32
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,650
Captain, please sail the ship out because we're all here.

33
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,850
Yes, sir!

34
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:41,050
"Houseboat Fishing Shock"

35
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,750
This ship is so spacious,

36
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,550
and yet we're the only ones on board?

37
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,850
The fact is, I reserved this boat for our company's pleasure trip,

38
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,650
but urgent work came in...

39
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,450
I couldn't cancel the trip at this point, so...

40
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:02,050
I asked Mr. Yamazaki and Mr. Mouri, whom I'm always being helped by

41
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,350
to come along.

42
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,050
Thank you for waiting!

43
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,750
Oh! Here's the food!

44
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,350
Finally, at last!

45
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:17,250
Go ahead everybody, help yourself to your heart's content!

46
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,050
Here, Mr. Kawai, have some too.

47
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,550
How do you like this fishing pole?

48
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,650
Oh, so that's the carbon type new model fishing pole

49
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,350
that is your pride and joy?

50
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,550
It's light as well as steady

51
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,250
so even a big catch is no big deal.

52
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,950
Please use this tonight.

53
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,050
And? What about you, Mr. Kawai?

54
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,650
No need for worry.

55
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,050
I brought one of the same type with me.

56
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,850
Oh...

57
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,350
Would you like to come along with us too, Mr. Mouri?

58
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,350
Fishing, would you like to go fishing?

59
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:22,650
But, I don't have a pole for Mr. Mouri.

60
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,350
You may use the one we have here, if it's okay with you.

61
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,550
We have several fishing poles here just in case, for our customers.

62
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,350
You're really service minded, how thoughtful.

63
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,350
Mr. Mouri, are you interested in fishing?

64
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,550
Fishing...

65
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,350
No thanks.

66
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,550
I guess beer is better for me!

67
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,550
Hello, we're almost there!

68
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,050
The scenic point for watching fireworks

69
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,450
is also a great spot for fishing!

70
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:02,950
Just the other day, a super large sea bream was caught here.

71
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,050
The tides are good today

72
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,650
so I'm sure you'll get a good catch.

73
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,650
It makes me so excited!

74
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,950
I wish you both the best of luck.

75
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:23,950
Yeah, I'll get a big one for sure!

76
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,650
The same here.

77
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,250
Wow!

78
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,850
It's so pretty.

79
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,050
Tamaya!

80
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,650
Are you enjoying yourselves?

81
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:45,350
Yes, watching fireworks in autumn is quite fascinating too.

82
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,550
Here, have some more.

83
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,550
Oh, thank you.

84
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,450
Sayori, will you please bring us more beer?

85
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,550
Yes, sir.

86
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,150
Bring some for Mr. Kawai and his guest too.

87
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,450
Yes, sir.

88
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,250
What was that?

89
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,650
What seems to be the matter?

90
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,850
That...

91
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:56,050
Mr. Kawai, please get a hold of yourself! Mr. Kawai!

92
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,850
Where's Mr. Yamazaki?

93
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,350
Are you okay, mister?

94
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,050
Don't touch!

95
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,450
Stay out of the way!

96
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,450
No good, he's already dead.

97
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,650
He's got burns on the palm of his hand.

98
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,350
This is...

99
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,850
The lights on the ship went out a while ago.

100
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,850
Yeah.

101
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,950
He said this fishing pole is made of carbon.

102
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,950
Just as I thought!

103
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,150
This part of the electrical lighting is exposed!

104
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,550
Which means...

105
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,650
Right.

106
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,350
Mr. Yamazaki was holding a carbon type fishing pole

107
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,650
that conducts electricity.

108
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:53,550
His feet is soaked with the seawater that was in the bucket.

109
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:58,650
Mr. Yamazaki's fishing pole probably accidentally touched

110
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,850
the part of the electrical wiring that was exposed

111
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,350
while he was fishing.

112
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,950
Therefore, he was electrocuted.

113
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,150
That accounts for the burn on the palm of his hand.

114
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:13,650
Mr. Kawai probably collapsed when he tried to help Mr. Yamazaki.

115
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,250
Please call the ambulance and the police, Sayori.

116
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,550
Yes, sir!

117
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,450
Captain, please take the boat back to the harbour.

118
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,750
Yes, sir.

119
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,950
And, what is the cause of his death?

120
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,750
We can't really say until the coroner finishes the autopsy, but...

121
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,050
According to the paramedics,

122
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:48,850
the victim's heart seems to have stopped instantaneously

123
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:53,850
due to intense electrical shock.

124
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,750
Just as I thought.

125
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:02,450
But why did Mr. Yamazaki's fishing pole touch the electrical wiring?

126
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,350
There were practically no waves today and it was quiet,

127
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,850
so the boat didn't sway as much either, did it?

128
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,350
That's true.

129
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:14,050
Mr. Kawai, can you tell us what happened?

130
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,150
Yes.

131
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:20,050
Well, the thing is... I happened to get a big bite on my pole.

132
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:26,250
It was so big that I couldn't handle it alone, so...

133
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,950
I asked Mr. Yamazaki to help me.

134
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,450
We were pulling the pole together when suddenly...

135
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,150
The line cut

136
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:42,050
and we fell backwards holding the fishing pole.

137
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,950
Then, everything went black...

138
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,850
It's as if I had murdered Mr. Yamazaki.

139
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,350
If only I didn't ask Mr. Yamazaki to help me,

140
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,650
this wouldn't have happened!

141
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,150
Please calm down.

142
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,650
It was an accident.

143
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,950
It's not your fault, Mr. Kawai.

144
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:09,350
About Mr. Kawai's testimony just now, when this case took place...

145
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,250
-Accident! -Oh, I'm sorry.

146
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:18,550
The captain of a boat that was sailing nearby also witnessed the scene.

147
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,750
Yes, I saw it.

148
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,450
It looked as if they were both trying to pull up a fish.

149
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,350
I think it was just when they were about to pull the fish up.

150
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,350
It seems the fishing line was so close to the rim of the boat

151
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,250
that it was virtually rubbing against it.

152
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,850
Then, the fishing line suddenly broke off and they both fell.

153
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,050
We sailed pass them right after that,

154
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,350
so I don't know what happened later.

155
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,250
This was what he saw.

156
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,050
See! So, it was an accident after all.

157
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,550
You even got a witness.

158
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,650
But both of them got electrocuted,

159
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,750
and why was only Mr. Kawai okay?

160
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,850
Mr. Yamazaki had a weak heart to begin with

161
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,950
so he was going to the hospital on a regular basis.

162
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,650
Come to think of it, he was also taking medication.

163
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,650
I was just lucky.

164
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,550
By the way, Mr. Unabara,

165
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,750
was that electric wiring always exposed like that?

166
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,450
I always check the entire boat before sailing off,

167
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,050
but I didn't notice any abnormalities at that time.

168
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,750
I also checked, so there's no mistake about it.

169
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,850
A part of the vinyl covering of the electrical wiring

170
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,550
was probably deteriorated

171
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,650
and when the fishing pole touched it,

172
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,450
it completely peeled off.

173
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,550
So it was an accident after all.

174
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,650
But, if so,

175
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,050
the responsibility of this accident will fall upon

176
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:54,250
Captain Unabara, who left the electrical wiring

177
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,950
in such a dangerous condition.

178
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,250
Oh, no!

179
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,250
Oh, I'm sorry.

180
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,750
I was just mentioning a possibility.

181
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:12,950
I'm sorry. Will you all please explain things in a little more detail?

182
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,350
Of course.

183
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,350
-Sure. -Thank you.

184
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,250
Shall we start then?

185
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,650
This is...

186
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,450
What's this?

187
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,950
The vinyl is melted as if it's been burnt.

188
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,250
Strange...

189
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,850
Drops of the melted vinyl should be somewhere.

190
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:20,050
Yet, there's none...

191
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,350
I get it.

192
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,250
That's why he...

193
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,850
I've figured it out.

194
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,850
This is not an accident...

195
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,850
but homicide!

196
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,900
All right then, Mr. Unabara, Mr. Kawai.

197
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,500
I'd like to submit a formal report of the accident,

198
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,700
so although I know it's inconvenient for you,

199
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,700
please come with me to the station.

200
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,100
Yes, sir.

201
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,900
As to the rest of you here, you may go for tonight.

202
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,800
Conan's not here.

203
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,800
I tell you, going here, there and everywhere all the time.

204
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,400
I'm here.

205
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,500
Just what were you doing?

206
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,600
We're going home.

207
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,000
Wait, I got to go to the restroom.

208
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,300
Oh boy...

209
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,700
Please wait, everyone!

210
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,100
This is no accident that happened coincidentally.

211
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:33,000
But, Mr. Mouri, you just mentioned a while ago that it was an accident.

212
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,100
Yes, but there is something that's bothering me.

213
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,400
Mr. Unabara, can you show everyone

214
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,000
the tip of the fish line that is cut, that Mr. Kawai was using?

215
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yes.

216
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,500
Mr. Unabara, what do you think, seeing that cut line?

217
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,800
What do I think?

218
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,100
Huh? Strange, this doesn't look to have been pulled apart.

219
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,000
It looks as if it's been cut by a knife or something.

220
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,700
Really?

221
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,100
-Officer. -Yes?

222
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,500
Please check the brim of the left shipboard.

223
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,000
The blade of a cutter knife is embedded.

224
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,800
And, a fish hook is hooked on the body of the ship underneath it.

225
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,000
Okay.

226
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,600
I'll go along too.

227
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,600
There it is! It's the blade of a cutter!

228
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,500
Officer!

229
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,100
See, over there!

230
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,400
A fish line.

231
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,800
Mr. Mouri! It's exactly as you said.

232
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,500
The blade of the cutter and fish hook are still here.

233
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,200
When I cleaned the ship before departing, they weren't there.

234
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,600
Sure they weren't,

235
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,800
because Mr. Kawai set it up after sailing out to the sea,

236
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,200
in order to kill Mr. Yamazaki.

237
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,600
What a thing to say, Mr. Mouri?

238
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,900
When just Mr. Yamazaki and you were the only ones on deck,

239
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,900
you embedded the blade of the cutter into the brim of the ship,

240
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,200
when Mr. Yamazaki's eyes weren't on you.

241
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,100
As well as, hook your fish hook onto the body of the ship.

242
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,500
Then, you pretended to have caught a big one,

243
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,500
and urged Mr. Yamazaki to help you.

244
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,400
When Mr. Yamazaki grabs your fishing pole,

245
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,200
the blade inserted in the brim of the ship cuts the line.

246
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,700
Finally, you pushed Mr. Yamazaki down

247
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,400
so that the fishing pole would touch the electrical wiring.

248
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,100
Don't be ridiculous!

249
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,600
I was electrocuted too, you know!

250
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,500
I was almost killed myself too!

251
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,300
Yes,

252
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:46,800
if you were bare-handed and bare-footed like Mr. Yamazaki.

253
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,300
Just what do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

254
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:54,300
Mr. Kawai, will you show me what's in your pocket?

255
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,400
I really don't have anything inside.

256
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,900
Mr. Kawai, will you please show us what's inside?

257
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,300
What is it?

258
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,600
I...

259
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,500
Please!

260
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,500
Mr. Kawai...

261
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
A flesh coloured rubber glove?

262
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,500
Mr. Kawai.

263
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,800
That's a pretty odd glove to be using for fishing, isn't it?

264
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,200
It's up to me what kind of a glove I want to use, isn't it?

265
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,400
Besides, this just so happened to be in my pocket.

266
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,900
I was bare-handed when that accident occurred.

267
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:35,400
Or is it that somebody saw me wearing gloves?

268
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,600
The same goes for the blade of the cutter.

269
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,700
I'll bet you don't have proof that I did it!!

270
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,200
It was just a mere coincidental accident that Yamazaki died!

271
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,900
No, it wasn't an accident.

272
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,100
I'm sure you had an intention to kill him!

273
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,700
What?

274
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,200
Think about it.

275
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,400
When you pull a fish line that almost rubs against the brim of the ship,

276
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,800
you'd have to pull it vertically against the brim.

277
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,200
If the fish line was suddenly cut,

278
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,900
they would've fallen perpendicular to the brim of the ship.

279
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,400
But in order for the fishing pole to touch the electrical wiring,

280
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,000
they would have to fall horizontally to the brim of the ship.

281
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,200
In other words, the moment the fish line was cut,

282
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,000
you pushed Mr. Yamazaki horizontally against the brim of the ship.

283
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,800
You did so to make the fishing pole

284
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,100
touch the exposed electrical wiring

285
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,900
with the intention to kill him.

286
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,600
Don't be ridiculous!

287
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,600
You're only letting your imagination run wild!

288
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,200
How can you be so sure that I pushed Mr. Yamazaki down?

289
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,200
How rude can you get?

290
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Please present more undeniable evidence!

291
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,500
I have evidence.

292
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,700
Will somebody light Mr. Kawai's lighter?

293
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,300
No good. It doesn't work.

294
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,500
Mr. Kawai,

295
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,700
you lit your cigarette with that lighter before we departed, didn't you?

296
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,900
Why won't it light now?

297
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,500
There seems to be

298
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,700
what looks to be the burnt remains on the wick of the lighter.

299
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:28,700
That adhered when he burnt the coating of the electrical wiring.

300
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,900
Mr. Kawai used the lighter to melt the coating of the electrical wiring

301
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,300
in order to expose the electrical wiring on the inside.

302
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,600
He then, probably wore the robber boots

303
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,400
that were lying around on the floor of the deck,

304
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,600
and after wearing the flesh coloured rubber gloves on his hands

305
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,400
and insulating himself...

306
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,600
He electrocuted Mr. Yamazki and killed him.

307
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,700
He then removed the boots,

308
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,500
lying down,

309
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,700
and hid the rubber gloves in his pocket,

310
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,900
and pretended to be passed out.

311
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:06,600
How about it, Mr. Kawai, am I wrong somewhere?

312
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,600
Yamazaki...

313
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,800
Yamazaki tried to take over my company

314
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,600
by lending money at an unreasonably high amount of interest.

315
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,800
Not only that. As collateral for the money he lent me,

316
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,700
he insisted that I get myself an expensive life insurance policy

317
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,100
with him as the beneficiary.

318
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:39,300
If I didn't kill him, he would've killed me one day anyway.

319
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,900
Someday...

320
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,300
Mr. Mouri.

321
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,800
Thank you so much the other day.

322
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,900
If that incident was closed as an accidental case,

323
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,000
I would've had to take responsibility for negligence of duty

324
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,700
and close down my business.

325
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,600
It's all thanks to you, Mr. Mouri.

326
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,600
If the investigation was carried out only on the surface,

327
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,700
the case couldn't have been genuinely solved at all.

328
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,200
Just as expected of the renowned detective, Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

329
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,600
Absolutely! There is no case that I cannot solve!

330
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,400
Come on, Dad. You were probably just in good shape.

331
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,200
Yeah, as for being in good shape,

332
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,600
you're sure doing just as good as those fireworks up there.

333
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,000
Tamaya!

334
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,640
Next Conan's Hint:

335
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,580
"Decorative clock"

336
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,260
-In the next episode... -Here comes the gorgeous Prosecutor Kujo!

337
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,800
She's mom's opponent, right?
