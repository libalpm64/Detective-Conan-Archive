1
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,230
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,130
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,130
Today, the case as well as the lies will be figured out.

4
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,430
The identity of the beautiful client sure is a surprise.

5
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,930
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,830
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,030
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,990
A beautiful client appears at the detective office.

9
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,390
Her name is Shizuka Ikenami.

10
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,690
She comes to ask Pops to look for her classmate

11
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,390
during her intermediate school days,

12
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,890
who belong to the same Kendo club,

13
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,590
whose name is Shiro Shibata.

14
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,590
He was located immediately.

15
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,190
He seemed to be working as a P.E. teacher in Shizuoka.

16
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,190
We set off immediately to his place, but...

17
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,690
what awaited us there was...

18
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,290
the dead body of Mr. Shiro Shibata who had been killed.

19
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:36,090
He had the picture of Shizuka Ikenami gripped firmly in his hands.

20
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,590
What bothers me is why the client is so full of lies.

21
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,190
Almost everything that she says is a lie.

22
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,190
What on earth is she hiding?

23
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,790
"A Client Full of Lies (Part 2)"

24
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,190
Officer Yokomizo.

25
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,190
We've found a blood smeared wooden kendo sword

26
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,290
that seems to be the murder weapon.

27
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,390
Really?

28
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,990
Yes, sir.

29
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,990
It was found by the emergency stairs right beside the front door.

30
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,290
Mrs. Shibata, did you have a wooden sword in the house?

31
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,490
Yes, on top of that shoe cabinet.

32
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,190
My husband kept it there to get rid of persistent solicitors.

33
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,290
It's not there right now, is it?

34
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,090
By the way, how many phones do you have?

35
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,790
Just two. One in the living room and one in the bedroom.

36
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,290
We did have one by the front door before too, though.

37
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,890
I see. I got it.

38
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:43,190
Now I know that the killer is you, Ms. Ikenami.

39
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,490
Hey, hey, Officer Yokomizo.

40
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,490
You made sure that he had the picture by calling him beforehand.

41
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,190
And in order to get it back,

42
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,990
you had already come here this morning.

43
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,990
However, you got into an argument with him

44
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,690
over the picture at the front door,

45
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,890
and on impulse struck him with the wooden sword

46
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,790
that was on top of the shoe cabinet.

47
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,190
Thinking that you had killed him,

48
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,290
you escaped from the emergency stairs.

49
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,190
But, Mr. Shibata was still alive at that time.

50
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,890
He desperately crawled across the floor

51
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,290
to the living room phone to get help,

52
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,290
but his body did not move as he willed it.

53
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:25,890
Just then, he sees the book with your picture between the pages.

54
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:30,190
He uses whatever strength that is left within himself...

55
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,690
and grabs the picture of the one who killed him, then dies.

56
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,390
But, it's only a picture...

57
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:43,390
There must be some secret behind the picture.

58
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,190
That's why she came back here again with you Mr. Mouri.

59
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,790
To get the picture back.

60
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,890
So, Ms. Ikenami,

61
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:55,790
please come to the station with me.

62
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,890
I refuse.

63
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,490
If you want to interrogate me,

64
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,990
please do so after you get an arrest warrant from court, will you?

65
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,990
Well, at this stage

66
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,090
when you are lacking in documents with credible evidence

67
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,490
on which the judge needs to base his impression of me,

68
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,390
I don't even think it is possible for you to compel him

69
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,390
to issue you a warrant of arrest anyway.

70
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,390
Of course, it would be a different story if Mrs. Shibata were there,

71
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:26,190
intends to file charges against us

72
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,990
for trespassing on private property.

73
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,790
What the...

74
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,190
Who the heck is this lady anyway?

75
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,790
Look at his left hand. It's smeared all over with blood.

76
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,590
He must've touched the wound on his head.

77
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,490
Strange, though.

78
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,690
There's no blood on the bandage around his finger.

79
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,290
Come to think of it, that lady's left hand was also...

80
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,390
Wait a second.

81
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,090
If so, on his right hand.

82
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,190
Hey.

83
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,890
I see, I get the picture now.

84
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,990
Hey!

85
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,590
That's a no, no!

86
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,190
So, the killer is...

87
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,090
She was here.

88
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,290
She came here before we came here.

89
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,990
To this blood smeared murder scene.

90
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,590
But, Ms. Ikenami...

91
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,890
the victim, Mr. Shibata was found dead

92
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:30,890
with your picture grabbed firmly in his hand, wasn't he?

93
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,690
I'll have to have you at least explain

94
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,290
what your relationship is with Mr. Shibata,

95
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:39,390
as well as why he happened to have that picture in his possession.

96
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:43,290
I have explained everything to Mr. Mouri already.

97
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,590
Then, come with us to the station and explain it to us too.

98
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,290
Then, let's do this.

99
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:55,190
I'll give Mr. Mouri power of attorney over me.

100
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,990
If he says I should go to the station

101
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,690
to be interrogated as a suspect,

102
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,290
I will.

103
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,790
Well...

104
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,690
Well, Mr. Mouri?

105
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,190
I think you should at least go for the interrogation.

106
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,990
But maybe it's not all that necessary.

107
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,190
Mr. Mouri!

108
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,690
-Well... -Mr. Mouri.

109
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,690
Mr. Mouri!

110
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,490
Mr. Mouri?

111
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,090
Ms. Ikenami, under these circumstances,

112
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:37,490
I guess you have no choice but to be interrogated.

113
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,690
Right?

114
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,990
Only not as a suspect but,

115
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:48,390
as a witness to prove the truth of the case

116
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,090
that I am about to disclose now.

117
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,540
Are you saying that she is not the killer?

118
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,840
No.

119
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,640
If she were the killer,

120
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:04,240
and if she came here with us again to get her picture back,

121
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,240
she would've walked into the house

122
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,440
saying that the door was not locked

123
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,240
the minute I rang the doorbell and no one answered.

124
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,140
If she had come here beforehand

125
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,740
and struck Mr. Shibata to death,

126
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,640
she should've known that the door wasn't locked!

127
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,940
The only chance she had to get the picture back

128
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,140
was during the short time

129
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:36,240
between when the body was found to when the police arrived.

130
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,340
Then, is it you, Mr. Yoshikawa?

131
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,040
Since you seem to have known

132
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,040
"Takezo Yoshikawa (47)" -that the door was open back then.

133
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:49,340
Besides, you're the one who found the dead body.

134
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,040
I'll bet you came back to the scene

135
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,140
to get rid of something that you didn't want the police to see.

136
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,140
Hey...

137
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,440
No, Mr. Yoshikawa is not the killer either.

138
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
If the late Mr. Shibata always left the door open,

139
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,140
it wouldn't be hard to assume that the door would've been open then too.

140
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,740
Besides, it would be much too dangerous for Mr. Yoshikawa

141
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,540
whose alibi around the estimated time of the killing is not all that clear

142
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,740
to set foot again into the scene of the crime.

143
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,440
If there was something that he wanted to come and get that badly,

144
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,240
he would've done so, first thing...

145
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,840
He wouldn't come and get it almost half a day after the murder.

146
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,340
He would've known that if he called,

147
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,740
there would be nobody here except for the dead body.

148
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,640
Moreover, he went out of his way to stop all of us

149
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,540
who were ready to leave.

150
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,240
If I were the killer,

151
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,740
I would see to it that the visitors leave first,

152
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,640
then sneak into the house alone.

153
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,940
Then, don't tell me that the killer is...

154
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:59,590
Yes, the one who seemingly has a legitimate alibi.

155
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,290
You!

156
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,990
Then, don't tell me that the killer is...

157
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:14,090
Yes, the one who seemingly has a legitimate alibi.

158
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,690
You!

159
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,590
Mrs. Kyoko Shibata.

160
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,390
Mrs. Shibata is the killer?

161
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,790
Mrs. Shibata, don't tell me that you...

162
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,790
But, Mr. Mouri...

163
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,890
Mrs. Shibata prepared breakfast

164
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,090
and left at 05:00 in the morning, you know?

165
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:38,790
Why was the paper that was delivered at 06:00 am found on the table, then?

166
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:43,190
Moreover, she got back here after 07:00 pm

167
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,090
when a friend of hers dropped her off.

168
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:49,290
That's just about when you arrived here, Mr. Mouri.

169
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,790
How could she, who came back after you arrived here,

170
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,790
have moved the morning paper onto the table?

171
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,790
It's true that I got here after 07:00 pm.

172
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,990
This is indeed a very convenient way of expressing the time,

173
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,290
don't you think?

174
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,690
Whether it's 07:05 pm or 07:10 pm,

175
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,490
we can say after 07:00 pm.

176
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:16,290
In other words, Mrs. Shibata could've got back just before we got here.

177
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,090
Wait a minute.

178
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,290
Then, are you saying that the breakfast on the table is...

179
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,290
It's probably what she prepared for him

180
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,590
when he got home at three in the morning.

181
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,790
All she had to do was put the morning papers beside it

182
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,890
to make it look like breakfast.

183
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,890
But, what about that video?

184
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:41,890
The program that was aired at 08:00 am was being recorded.

185
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,490
All that needs to be done

186
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:51,090
is to set the pre-set record time to "long" and you've got it.

187
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,790
So, this is what Mrs. Shibata did...

188
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,290
"Around 03:00 am" -First, she urged her husband

189
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,390
who came back at 03:00 am in the morning

190
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:03,190
to take a bath or something, in order to kill time.

191
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,190
At just before 05:00 am,

192
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,390
she makes him eat the night snack on the table.

193
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:12,590
Then, she calls her husband while he is eating to go to the corridor,

194
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,090
and strikes him to death from behind with the wooden sword.

195
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:19,390
She then set the video up,

196
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,590
locks the front door and leaves the house.

197
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,790
"Around 05:00 am" -She gets into her friend's car that is waiting for her

198
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,990
at the main entrance of the condo at 05:00 am.

199
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,490
"Around 07:00 pm" -She returns after 07:00 pm,

200
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,990
takes the newspaper out of the door post box,

201
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,690
and put it on the dining table. Then she calls the police.

202
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:44,390
She has a perfect alibi.

203
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,990
I see.

204
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:50,790
That way she can make it look like somebody who had visited

205
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,790
had killed her husband while he was having breakfast

206
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,090
at around 08:00 in the morning.

207
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,290
But, when Mrs. Shibata returned,

208
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,590
something that she didn't expect had happened.

209
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,390
Her husband who was supposed to have been lying in the corridor,

210
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,990
in order to call for help,

211
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,790
crawled all the way over to the living room.

212
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:16,190
Yes, and as she was watching what had happened,

213
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,690
she gets a phone call.

214
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,190
Don't tell me that it was from me?

215
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:26,790
Yes, your call saying, "I'm going to pick you up soon."

216
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:31,190
Mrs. Shibata who heard the message on the answer phone got an idea.

217
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:35,090
Instead of reporting directly to the police

218
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,390
with the morning paper and food on the table,

219
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,290
she thought it better to make somebody else discover the body

220
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,990
and return home later.

221
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,390
That way, it would make her much less suspicious.

222
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,090
Then, where was Mrs. Shibata till then?

223
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:54,590
She was probably hiding behind the door of the emergency stairs

224
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:58,690
besides the front door until Mr. Yoshikawa came.

225
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:04,290
Although we seemed to have arrived here earlier than he did.

226
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,390
Mr. Detective, then what is that picture all about?

227
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:12,090
Why did Mr. Shibata have her picture gripped in his hand?

228
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:15,290
That's a camouflage that Mrs. Shibata thought up

229
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,590
to on the spur of the moment to divert everyone's attention.

230
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,490
Camouflage?

231
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:24,190
First, please look at her husband's left hand.

232
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,790
The palm of his hand is smeared with blood and yet,

233
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:30,090
there is no blood on the bandage that is wrapped around his ring finger.

234
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,690
You're right!

235
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,090
Then, look at his right hand.

236
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,890
This is...

237
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,890
Don't tell me that this is a trace of...

238
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:48,290
Yes. When Mrs. Shibata came to the living room,

239
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,290
Mr. Shibata was already holding it in his hand!

240
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,890
The marriage ring that is a symbol of their being husband and wife.

241
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,790
Mrs. Shibata who realized

242
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,890
that her husband was not wearing his marriage ring

243
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:04,590
that he always wears on his left ring finger,

244
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:08,190
knew right away that he was grabbing it in his right hand,

245
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,990
and somehow opened his fist that had already closed tight

246
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,990
and removed the ring.

247
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,190
But, if she left things as were,

248
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,390
his right hand would look awfully unnatural and stand out.

249
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:21,990
Therefore, she made him hold the picture of Ms. Ikenami

250
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,390
that was between the pages of the book.

251
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,140
I see.

252
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:33,740
So, it could've been anything if it didn't point at her.

253
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,340
Yes, she then tried to put the ring back

254
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,140
on the ring finger of his left hand,

255
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,740
but she couldn't put it back on because his fingers were bent.

256
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,940
That's why she wrapped a bandage around his finger.

257
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,340
All to hide the traces of his marriage ring.

258
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,940
She probably also wrapped his little finger

259
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,240
so that it wouldn't stand out as much.

260
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,940
Officer Yokomizo, I found it.

261
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,240
The trace of a marriage ring under the bandage.

262
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,840
Okay, take a picture of it right away, will you?

263
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,740
Now, for the ring.

264
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,740
Search every nook and cranny in this house.

265
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,240
No, that won't be necessary.

266
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,940
I'm sure Mrs. Shibata still has it on her.

267
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,940
I don't think she would hide a ring that would have luminal reaction

268
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,340
even if the blood were to be wiped off,

269
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,740
somewhere inside the house before the police arrive.

270
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,640
Of course she wouldn't hide it by the emergency stairs either.

271
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,240
The safest thing to do would be to get rid of it

272
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,740
after the police leave.

273
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,340
That's why I'm sure she still has it with her.

274
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,940
The dying message that her husband left behind to indicate

275
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,240
that he was killed by her.

276
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,540
I guess evil never wins after all.

277
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,240
The evil things that my husband and Mr. Yoshikawa had been doing

278
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,640
didn't come out in the open yet.

279
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,240
Don't you think it's unfair?

280
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,140
They were gambling playing mahjong!

281
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,140
My husband was playing mahjong and gambling everyday.

282
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,040
Moreover, they were gambling exorbitant amounts

283
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,840
that would make your eyes pop out.

284
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,240
Thanks to them, I had to sell off the computer, jewelry, car,

285
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,240
laser disc player and speaker, one after the other.

286
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,640
All because of that detestable game.

287
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,540
My husband told me

288
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,740
that the next thing he was selling was my golf clubs.

289
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,340
And, after that he would even sell off

290
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,340
the sword that my father gave him as a wedding gift.

291
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,140
Let's go to the station so we can hear you out.

292
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:44,540
Yes, right after I change clothes.

293
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,140
A sword?

294
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,140
Oh no.

295
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,640
Don't tell me?

296
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,740
Stay away!

297
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,540
I really don't have a choice.

298
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:08,940
-I need to stop my evil deeds. -Mrs. Shibata, please calm down.

299
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,140
I'm finished, because I've killed somebody.

300
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,840
-Mrs. Shibata. -Will you move out of the way?

301
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,340
What's with you, stay away from me.

302
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,740
Stay away I said!

303
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,340
Are you going to kill again?

304
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,440
I'm asking if you're still going to kill

305
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,640
after having already killed your husband.

306
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,240
Kill... I was just going to kill myself.

307
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,340
You idiot! There is no such thing as mine or yours when it comes to life!

308
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,540
It's something very important that you're not supposed to take away!

309
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:03,640
Those who kill are all killers and fools!

310
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,440
It doesn't make any difference if it's your own life!

311
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,140
Don't you ever forget that!

312
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,140
Shall we get going then, officer?

313
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,240
Oh, yes.

314
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,640
Before that, Ms. Ikenami.

315
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,840
Isn't it about time you tell us

316
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,040
the reason for your four lies?

317
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,740
I can't figure out how you with weak bronchial tubes like knitting,

318
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,240
when there is yarn flying all over the place.

319
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,740
Knowing what kind of fish it is, just by looking at slices of it,

320
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,940
goes to show that you like cooking.

321
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,240
Moreover, you are married

322
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,140
but you're hiding the trace of the wedding ring

323
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,340
that is on your ring finger.

324
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,440
And, the name Reiko...

325
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,940
Nobody in that ninja novel has that name.

326
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,540
And, what is the meaning behind the reason you mumbled "Reiko"

327
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,240
in the coffee shop?

328
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,940
Not "Reiko", but "Rei" of cold, "co" of coffee.

329
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,840
She was probably going to order cold coffee,

330
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,640
but decided otherwise.

331
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,040
Because calling iced coffee, "rei-co"

332
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,540
would give away the fact that she is from Osaka.

333
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,440
In this day and age, though,

334
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,240
the only people who would talk like that are mom or middle aged women.

335
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,140
Right, old lady?

336
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,240
Heiji and Kazuha.

337
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,240
No.

338
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,440
Hey, old lady!

339
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,740
You finished what you had to do, right?

340
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,340
So go on back to Osaka.

341
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,140
Hey, you!

342
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,640
Hey, stop calling her old lady, how rude!

343
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,640
It doesn't matter what I call her

344
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,540
because she's my mother.

345
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:52,390
She can't be, because she's not dark skinned!

346
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,390
You idiot!

347
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,740
I got my dark skin from my grandpa!

348
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,640
Oh my God.

349
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,840
What? You came to check me out?

350
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,740
Yes, that's right.

351
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,440
Every time Heiji is with you,

352
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,640
he seems to have serious wounds, right?

353
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,340
I thought that maybe you were making him go through

354
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,940
rigorous training of some sort,

355
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,740
saying that he needed it in order to become a detective.

356
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,440
Even when I came to Osaka,

357
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,240
you didn't drop by but went straight back to Tokyo.

358
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,240
So, I was worried that you may be a ruthless and callous guy.

359
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,240
Talk for yourself, mom. You didn't even come to the hospital back then,

360
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,840
but was waiting in front of the balloon fish restaurant.

361
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,440
I couldn't let things go by without checking it out any longer,

362
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,840
and that's why I decided to come.

363
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,540
However, after seeing you, I really got the picture.

364
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,140
That you, Mr. Mouri, are a sharp, keen and nice man

365
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,140
that Heiji couldn't help but respect.

366
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,940
Well, thank you.

367
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,140
I arranged things beforehand with Shiro by phone,

368
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,540
and made it sound like I was looking for him.

369
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,540
You saw through my lies

370
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,940
and the murder of Shiro that happened coincidentally too.

371
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,640
You solved it all in no time at all.

372
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,940
I'm really sad about what happened to Shiro,

373
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,540
but I got the picture that I had been looking for back.

374
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,440
What a lady.

375
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,240
I thought you said you didn't want the picture back

376
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,940
because it's a picture of an underclassman beating you, and it vexed you,

377
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,240
so you didn't want it back.

378
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,840
Now, I can rest at ease leaving Heiji and Kazuha in your hands.

379
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,340
Leave them in my hands?

380
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,040
By the way, why are the two of you carrying luggage?

381
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,740
Hey, didn't you hear anything from this kid?

382
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,440
What? You mean that phone call was for real?

383
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,480
Next Conan's Hint:

384
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,360
"Numbered tag"

385
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,800
Must watch those two people.

386
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,300
Good looking brothers and sisters.
