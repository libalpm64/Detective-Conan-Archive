1
00:00:05,348 --> 00:00:06,948
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:06,948 --> 00:00:08,748
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:08,748 --> 00:00:10,348
There's not much time left for The Youth Detective Squad!

4
00:00:10,348 --> 00:00:11,848
Curtain call the case.

5
00:00:11,848 --> 00:00:13,648
But make it in time for the curtains rising on stage.

6
00:00:13,648 --> 00:00:15,248
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:16,848
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:16,848 --> 00:00:19,048
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,422 --> 00:02:00,422
Tamanosuke Ito's popular traveling Theatre Troupe

10
00:02:00,422 --> 00:02:03,122
came to our town to perform a play.

11
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:06,722
"Taketori Story" -The show this time is "Taketori Story".

12
00:02:06,722 --> 00:02:09,322
However, the person who plays the main character Princess Kaguya,

13
00:02:09,322 --> 00:02:11,622
Ms. Renge Kataoka, was kidnapped.

14
00:02:12,722 --> 00:02:15,122
Once the police starts their investigation,

15
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:19,422
I realize that this is a false kidnapping done by Ms. Renge herself.

16
00:02:21,122 --> 00:02:25,022
However, Ms. Renge wasn't where she was supposedly held.

17
00:02:26,622 --> 00:02:29,422
Somehow, she was really kidnapped.

18
00:02:31,022 --> 00:02:33,222
The case started to move on...

19
00:02:33,222 --> 00:02:36,422
And the curtain of the play has also gone up.

20
00:02:40,322 --> 00:02:46,022
"Concurrent Stage and Kidnapping (Part 2)"

21
00:02:55,222 --> 00:03:00,622
Once upon a time, there was an old man who harvests bamboo.

22
00:03:00,622 --> 00:03:03,922
What's going on? The curtain is up...

23
00:03:03,922 --> 00:03:06,222
There is no Princess Kaguya.

24
00:03:06,222 --> 00:03:08,022
Is it all right?

25
00:03:14,922 --> 00:03:16,722
Don't tell me that... Director!

26
00:03:16,722 --> 00:03:17,822
You really...

27
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:20,022
You really are going to put her on stage!

28
00:03:20,022 --> 00:03:22,422
We're talking about the leading role, Princess Kaguya!

29
00:03:23,522 --> 00:03:26,122
"Yoichi Azuma (28)" -Her lines are really long, you know!

30
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,222
"Kantaro Sawamura (23)" -True...

31
00:03:27,222 --> 00:03:28,522
Don't worry.

32
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:29,822
I changed the script.

33
00:03:29,822 --> 00:03:32,222
Everyone, hurry and memorize it!

34
00:03:32,222 --> 00:03:35,222
"Mataroku Onoue (35)"

35
00:03:35,222 --> 00:03:36,522
I changed it so that Megumi,

36
00:03:36,522 --> 00:03:38,522
who is Kaguya as a child, has more parts,

37
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:41,722
and shortened the adult part, as well as.

38
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:42,922
The stage direction.

39
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,822
With the positioning of Kaguya and the lighting,

40
00:03:44,822 --> 00:03:47,322
we will try not to show her face.

41
00:03:47,322 --> 00:03:49,022
"Tamanosuke Ito (17)" -Except for the climax

42
00:03:49,022 --> 00:03:51,222
where Kaguya returns to the moon,

43
00:03:51,222 --> 00:03:53,622
we will need to show her face...

44
00:03:53,622 --> 00:03:55,522
I'm telling you, it won't work...

45
00:03:55,522 --> 00:03:58,122
Life is what the traveling theater is all about.

46
00:03:58,122 --> 00:04:00,222
"Kikuno Ichimura (40)" -There are times when it pours.

47
00:04:02,022 --> 00:04:04,022
"Hikoemon Bando (50)" -Tough times are indeed

48
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:06,122
when we should all come together,

49
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:08,222
because doing so will make for a great performance.

50
00:04:08,222 --> 00:04:09,222
Words of wisdom by the old man,

51
00:04:09,222 --> 00:04:11,322
I mean, the late director.

52
00:04:11,322 --> 00:04:15,522
Let's have faith that Renge will return and do our best.

53
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:16,722
No, but...

54
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:18,322
Please let me try!

55
00:04:18,322 --> 00:04:19,322
Ran...

56
00:04:19,322 --> 00:04:22,022
Everyone is looking forward to the show.

57
00:04:22,022 --> 00:04:23,822
Cancelling is out of the question.

58
00:04:25,122 --> 00:04:27,522
Let me do it! Please!

59
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:29,922
Ran.

60
00:04:31,722 --> 00:04:34,522
All right, let's do it, if you say so.

61
00:04:34,522 --> 00:04:36,722
Yeah, if you say so.

62
00:04:36,722 --> 00:04:38,322
That's true...

63
00:04:38,322 --> 00:04:40,022
Thank you!

64
00:04:42,022 --> 00:04:43,222
Thank you.

65
00:04:43,222 --> 00:04:44,922
Thanks, everyone!

66
00:04:44,922 --> 00:04:49,922
Hey, Mr. Tamanosuke, how long into the show is the climax?

67
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,322
Well...

68
00:04:51,322 --> 00:04:53,922
The whole show is approximately two hours so...

69
00:04:53,922 --> 00:04:56,722
That would be just around an hour and a half.

70
00:04:56,722 --> 00:05:02,022
That means that we'll have to find Ms. Renge by then, right?

71
00:05:02,022 --> 00:05:04,522
You must have some clue, little one?

72
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:06,522
What? Yeah...

73
00:05:06,522 --> 00:05:07,622
Right on!

74
00:05:07,622 --> 00:05:10,222
-What? -Please leave it to us!

75
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:12,722
The Youth Detective Squad, in action!

76
00:05:12,722 --> 00:05:14,022
-Yeah! -Yeah!

77
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:17,922
Hey... I never ask for help from you guys...

78
00:05:17,922 --> 00:05:19,322
Then I'm coming with you.

79
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:22,722
Mr. Tamanosuke.

80
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:26,422
My part for The Emperor is about half into the play, an hour.

81
00:05:26,422 --> 00:05:29,122
I'll look for Renge until then too.

82
00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:30,222
Director...

83
00:05:31,422 --> 00:05:33,322
The case is in progress too...

84
00:05:36,422 --> 00:05:38,322
"Shuichi Ohnuki (38)"

85
00:05:38,322 --> 00:05:40,622
Can you hear me, officers?

86
00:05:43,322 --> 00:05:46,222
I'm almost at the designated parking lot.

87
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:04,622
He received some kind of an envelope.

88
00:06:07,122 --> 00:06:10,122
It says to switch cars to the one written on the memo.

89
00:06:10,122 --> 00:06:11,222
The number is...

90
00:06:14,922 --> 00:06:16,522
It's this car!

91
00:06:39,822 --> 00:06:42,522
Officer, this is from a cell phone.

92
00:06:42,522 --> 00:06:43,622
I'll answer it.

93
00:06:45,222 --> 00:06:47,022
Hello?

94
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:50,522
Yes...

95
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:51,822
I understand.

96
00:06:53,222 --> 00:06:56,022
I was told to go north of Takayama street.

97
00:06:56,022 --> 00:06:57,522
I will obey their instructions.

98
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:16,022
This child possesses beauty that does not exist in this world,

99
00:07:16,022 --> 00:07:18,622
and there are no dark places within the house she resides,

100
00:07:18,622 --> 00:07:20,422
for it is filled with light.

101
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:29,222
It's almost time, Ms. Ran.

102
00:07:30,422 --> 00:07:33,922
Calm down...

103
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:40,922
This place is where Ms. Renge was confined, right?

104
00:07:40,922 --> 00:07:44,522
Well, that was actually a false alarm.

105
00:07:48,322 --> 00:07:52,422
Which means whoever helped with Renge's false kidnapping

106
00:07:52,422 --> 00:07:54,922
is the real kidnapper.

107
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:57,022
Is that right, little one?

108
00:07:57,022 --> 00:07:59,922
Right, that's what I think.

109
00:07:59,922 --> 00:08:01,822
No doubt about it.

110
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:09,622
The problem is who is that person?

111
00:08:11,222 --> 00:08:13,422
But there aren't many people

112
00:08:13,422 --> 00:08:16,922
for a young woman can easily ask to do this.

113
00:08:20,622 --> 00:08:22,622
What's up, Conan?

114
00:08:22,622 --> 00:08:24,422
Do you see something?

115
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:27,022
Wait a minute.

116
00:08:27,022 --> 00:08:30,222
What is it? It's just a construction site?

117
00:08:30,222 --> 00:08:32,822
Hey! Isn't that where...

118
00:08:32,822 --> 00:08:34,622
Yeah, right! You're right!

119
00:08:34,622 --> 00:08:36,822
What?

120
00:08:36,822 --> 00:08:37,822
What's going on?

121
00:08:37,822 --> 00:08:40,622
What are you talking about?

122
00:08:40,622 --> 00:08:42,622
But, back then...

123
00:08:53,722 --> 00:08:56,022
What? No, but...

124
00:08:57,522 --> 00:08:58,622
Yes.

125
00:08:59,722 --> 00:09:01,222
Yes.

126
00:09:01,222 --> 00:09:02,622
I understand.

127
00:09:06,622 --> 00:09:08,222
What? Inspector!

128
00:09:08,222 --> 00:09:09,322
They got away!

129
00:09:09,322 --> 00:09:10,322
Don't let him get away!

130
00:09:10,322 --> 00:09:11,822
Hey, Mr. Mouri!

131
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,622
Stop!

132
00:09:28,022 --> 00:09:29,922
Make a right turn there, Inspector!

133
00:09:29,922 --> 00:09:31,422
-Officer Takagi! -Yes, sir!

134
00:09:39,522 --> 00:09:41,022
Mr. Ohnuki!

135
00:09:41,022 --> 00:09:43,022
Are... Are you okay?

136
00:09:43,022 --> 00:09:44,222
Come on!

137
00:09:47,222 --> 00:09:49,522
What happened?

138
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,622
I...

139
00:09:50,622 --> 00:09:53,222
I was told on the cell phone to shake off the police

140
00:09:53,222 --> 00:09:55,822
and come in here...

141
00:09:55,822 --> 00:09:59,322
And when I stopped the car suddenly out of nowhere...

142
00:10:13,022 --> 00:10:15,022
I'm sorry.

143
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:16,822
Officer Takagi, emergency deployment at the double!

144
00:10:16,822 --> 00:10:18,522
Yes, sir!

145
00:10:18,522 --> 00:10:20,722
And what about the hostage!

146
00:10:20,722 --> 00:10:23,322
The person said, "We'll let her go as soon as her safety is confirmed."

147
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,022
"So tell them to wait until then"...

148
00:10:25,022 --> 00:10:27,422
Darn it! The person is making this some kind of joke...

149
00:10:30,622 --> 00:10:32,222
Oh, Officer Takagi?

150
00:10:32,222 --> 00:10:36,922
There's something Pops wanted you to check out...

151
00:10:36,922 --> 00:10:39,722
Sorry, there's no time for that!

152
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,222
What? What do you mean?

153
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:45,222
And the play kept on rolling...

154
00:10:45,222 --> 00:10:49,722
Kaguya tells the Prince Ishizukuri

155
00:10:49,722 --> 00:10:52,522
to bring the holy stone bowl of the Buddha.

156
00:10:52,522 --> 00:10:57,222
To the Prince Kuramochi, she tells him to bring the jeweled sprig.

157
00:10:57,222 --> 00:10:59,722
Finally, she tells Counselor Ohtomo no Miyuki

158
00:10:59,722 --> 00:11:02,622
to bring her a colored jewel from the neck of a dragon.

159
00:11:02,622 --> 00:11:04,422
Oh, I'm so nervous!

160
00:11:04,422 --> 00:11:08,322
Please hurry back, Ms. Renge, Tamanosuke!

161
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:53,878
Yes, of course I wasn't looking behind me.

162
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,978
Hey, you guys can't come in here!

163
00:12:02,978 --> 00:12:04,978
You're not allowed to cross the yellow line.

164
00:12:04,978 --> 00:12:06,478
I'm sorry.

165
00:12:06,478 --> 00:12:09,278
So he's still hasn't been caught at inspection point?

166
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:10,378
What?

167
00:12:10,378 --> 00:12:15,078
No, although we set it up in less than a minute.

168
00:12:15,078 --> 00:12:17,578
Hey! I told you not to go in there...

169
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:19,078
Aren't there any witnesses?

170
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:20,078
What?

171
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:22,678
You are...

172
00:12:22,678 --> 00:12:24,878
Anyway, what about the witness?

173
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,478
When he was attacked?

174
00:12:26,478 --> 00:12:28,078
What...

175
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:30,278
No one saw anything?

176
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:32,778
It was right after I got out of the car.

177
00:12:54,178 --> 00:12:55,578
Isn't that...

178
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,478
Camera!

179
00:13:04,978 --> 00:13:06,578
Thank you for your cooperation!

180
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,178
Do you see something, little one?

181
00:13:08,178 --> 00:13:09,178
Yeah.

182
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:12,278
There's no doubt about it!

183
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:14,278
What do you mean, Conan?

184
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:16,678
Did you find a clue in the video?

185
00:13:16,678 --> 00:13:21,178
But with the camera there the scene is out of range.

186
00:13:21,178 --> 00:13:23,278
Yeah, but the kidnapper...

187
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:24,378
Hey!

188
00:13:25,678 --> 00:13:27,278
That's hurt!

189
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:28,778
That's enough!

190
00:13:28,778 --> 00:13:32,078
I'm sorry, I thought you...

191
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:34,778
I figured that's what was going on.

192
00:13:34,778 --> 00:13:37,278
What? Where did he go?

193
00:13:41,478 --> 00:13:43,378
What? Did it come?

194
00:13:43,378 --> 00:13:44,478
Mr. Mouri?

195
00:13:44,478 --> 00:13:45,878
Officer Takagi.

196
00:13:45,878 --> 00:13:49,178
-Yes? -Bring everyone outside here.

197
00:13:49,178 --> 00:13:50,978
What? Yes.

198
00:13:50,978 --> 00:13:52,178
And...

199
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:54,478
There's one more thing...

200
00:13:54,478 --> 00:13:55,578
Yes.

201
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:02,478
What is it, Mr. Mouri?

202
00:14:02,478 --> 00:14:03,678
Officer Takagi.

203
00:14:03,678 --> 00:14:04,678
Yes.

204
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:05,878
It's already on the screen.

205
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:10,978
I asked them to forward this from the investigation headquarters.

206
00:14:10,978 --> 00:14:14,378
The problem is the chimney seen here on the screen.

207
00:14:14,378 --> 00:14:17,878
The fact is this was taken down four days ago.

208
00:14:17,878 --> 00:14:19,178
What?

209
00:14:19,178 --> 00:14:23,378
This public bath was taken down to be remodeled.

210
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:28,378
In other words, this was not taken on the same day it was sent.

211
00:14:28,378 --> 00:14:30,378
Which means...

212
00:14:30,378 --> 00:14:32,978
As long as the image was set up to be forwarded,

213
00:14:32,978 --> 00:14:36,978
the kidnapper could've been on the receiving end too.

214
00:14:36,978 --> 00:14:39,578
In other words, what you're trying to say is...

215
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,878
The kidnapper was among us!

216
00:14:41,878 --> 00:14:43,178
Officer Takagi.

217
00:14:43,178 --> 00:14:46,678
Yes. I looked into it just like Mr. Mouri said.

218
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:49,378
I checked on who was always on the receiving end of the image

219
00:14:49,378 --> 00:14:51,078
sent out by the kidnapper

220
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:55,078
as well as the instructions by phone.

221
00:14:59,878 --> 00:15:02,378
Knock... Knock it out...

222
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:08,678
And take a look at the recorded image of the security camera.

223
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:16,478
Mr. Ohnuki, instructed to do so by the kidnapper,

224
00:15:16,478 --> 00:15:18,778
you tried to shake off the police.

225
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:20,178
That's right.

226
00:15:20,178 --> 00:15:21,378
When was that?

227
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,478
When...

228
00:15:23,478 --> 00:15:25,778
When I was stopped at the traffic light.

229
00:15:25,778 --> 00:15:29,078
I'm sure you officers heard the exchange too.

230
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:32,778
But, we couldn't hear the kidnapper's voice.

231
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:35,878
That's because it was a telephone call.

232
00:15:35,878 --> 00:15:39,678
That telephone call, did it really come in?

233
00:15:39,678 --> 00:15:42,178
What are you trying to say?

234
00:15:42,178 --> 00:15:48,078
Then why did the kidnapper take the cell phone with the ransom?

235
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:50,578
That's...

236
00:15:50,578 --> 00:15:51,978
What?

237
00:15:51,978 --> 00:15:55,878
What? No, but...

238
00:15:55,878 --> 00:15:58,978
Yes...

239
00:15:58,978 --> 00:16:00,278
I understand.

240
00:16:01,978 --> 00:16:03,378
This is...

241
00:16:03,378 --> 00:16:07,078
As you can see, he is not using the phone.

242
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:08,478
If we look at the cell phone,

243
00:16:08,478 --> 00:16:10,978
we can tell that there is no call log.

244
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:13,778
That's why he didn't leave it behind.

245
00:16:13,778 --> 00:16:18,678
It is probably somewhere along with the ransom.

246
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:22,578
If we search the area, we will soon have the results.

247
00:16:22,578 --> 00:16:27,378
But before that, we will need to rescue the hostage.

248
00:16:27,378 --> 00:16:28,878
What's this supposed to mean?

249
00:16:28,878 --> 00:16:31,278
The kidnapper himself should know.

250
00:16:35,178 --> 00:16:37,878
I don't know! I don't know a thing!

251
00:16:37,878 --> 00:16:39,478
Quit fooling, Ohnuki!

252
00:16:46,878 --> 00:16:48,278
Where's my daughter!

253
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:49,878
Where's Renge!

254
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:51,578
President...

255
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,078
If something happens to my daughter,

256
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:55,278
you won't get away with this!

257
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:56,678
Just remember that!

258
00:16:56,678 --> 00:17:00,378
No! I just helped your daughter to do

259
00:17:00,378 --> 00:17:01,578
what she asked me to do...

260
00:17:01,578 --> 00:17:02,878
Helped?

261
00:17:04,378 --> 00:17:07,278
Right, in the beginning it was just an act.

262
00:17:07,278 --> 00:17:11,678
So, Ms. Renge can definitely say who helped her out.

263
00:17:11,678 --> 00:17:14,778
That is she can name the real kidnapper!

264
00:17:14,778 --> 00:17:19,778
So, the kidnapper can't just release her.

265
00:17:19,778 --> 00:17:22,778
Were you planning to kill her from the beginning?

266
00:17:22,778 --> 00:17:25,378
I don't know! I don't know a thing!

267
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,278
I'm not going to talk anymore!

268
00:17:28,278 --> 00:17:30,778
Please stay here, Mr. Ohnuki.

269
00:17:35,278 --> 00:17:37,578
To protect the beloved Kaguya,

270
00:17:37,578 --> 00:17:41,878
The Emperor dispatched 2000 soldiers to the Taketori house...

271
00:17:43,378 --> 00:17:45,378
Don't worry.

272
00:17:45,378 --> 00:17:47,678
We are definitely going to find Ms. Renge!

273
00:17:47,678 --> 00:17:49,578
Leave it to us!

274
00:17:55,278 --> 00:17:57,578
The Youth Detective Squad to the rescue!

275
00:17:57,578 --> 00:17:58,878
-Yeah! -Yeah!

276
00:18:03,278 --> 00:18:06,678
Brother, hurry back!

277
00:18:06,678 --> 00:18:08,078
Just around here...

278
00:18:09,278 --> 00:18:10,578
I found it!

279
00:18:10,578 --> 00:18:11,578
This is it!

280
00:18:11,578 --> 00:18:13,478
What is it? Weed?

281
00:18:13,478 --> 00:18:17,078
It hasn't even rained, why is it so muddy?

282
00:18:17,078 --> 00:18:19,278
Maybe it grew near water?

283
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:20,378
That's it!

284
00:18:29,878 --> 00:18:30,978
You're not leaving!

285
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,778
Tamanosuke!

286
00:18:37,378 --> 00:18:41,278
I'm not going to return you to the moon, Kaguya!

287
00:18:44,378 --> 00:18:46,878
Come on! No way! Is he serious?

288
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:50,378
If I can be by your side, this country,

289
00:18:50,378 --> 00:18:52,078
my parents, I'm ready to give everything up!

290
00:18:53,578 --> 00:18:55,678
Mr. Tamanosuke's eyes...

291
00:18:55,678 --> 00:18:57,778
They are not looking at Princess Kaguya,

292
00:18:57,778 --> 00:19:00,478
and they are surely not looking at me.

293
00:19:00,478 --> 00:19:04,678
Have faith in me. I want you to stay with me.

294
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:07,278
Kaguya, forever...

295
00:19:11,378 --> 00:19:14,378
The possibility of the kidnapper choosing a place far from here,

296
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:17,078
knowing that it may be discovered, is low.

297
00:19:17,078 --> 00:19:20,178
If so, the place of confinement should be somewhere nearby again.

298
00:19:20,178 --> 00:19:21,478
And that place is probably...

299
00:19:21,478 --> 00:19:23,378
A place that has to do with water!

300
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:25,278
-Okay! -Leave it to me!

301
00:19:27,478 --> 00:19:29,078
In the light of the night,

302
00:19:29,078 --> 00:19:31,378
brighter than the bright noon day,

303
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,478
comes the messenger from the moon riding

304
00:19:33,478 --> 00:19:35,578
upon a cloud descending towards earth.

305
00:19:53,078 --> 00:19:54,978
I found her, Conan!

306
00:20:05,378 --> 00:20:08,078
Are you okay, Ms. Renge?

307
00:20:08,078 --> 00:20:09,478
The play...

308
00:20:09,478 --> 00:20:11,278
What happened to the play?

309
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:14,378
Hurry, Kaguya! Come here!

310
00:20:14,378 --> 00:20:16,278
Let's go back to the moon together!

311
00:20:23,878 --> 00:20:25,078
Ends here...

312
00:20:26,278 --> 00:20:27,678
I can't watch anymore.

313
00:20:32,878 --> 00:20:34,378
Ms. Renge!

314
00:20:34,378 --> 00:20:35,478
Renge?

315
00:20:36,578 --> 00:20:38,178
No, I can't do this.

316
00:20:38,178 --> 00:20:41,978
Not after all the trouble I put you through...

317
00:20:41,978 --> 00:20:43,078
I can't!

318
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:46,678
What are you talking about, Ms. Renge?

319
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,278
That won't do...

320
00:20:48,278 --> 00:20:50,578
Neither for you nor Mr. Tamanosuke...

321
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:54,278
I can understand.

322
00:20:58,978 --> 00:21:00,178
Ran...

323
00:21:01,378 --> 00:21:02,478
Ms. Renge!

324
00:21:20,678 --> 00:21:22,478
We will meet again.

325
00:21:22,478 --> 00:21:25,378
I believe in you. Kaguya.

326
00:21:25,378 --> 00:21:27,278
No, I mean Renge!

327
00:21:28,478 --> 00:21:29,678
Yes.

328
00:21:30,878 --> 00:21:31,978
Yes!

329
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:42,278
I hate to admit it...

330
00:21:42,278 --> 00:21:43,778
But it's so inspiring!

331
00:23:20,078 --> 00:23:22,978
After that, Secretary Ohnuki was arrested.

332
00:23:22,978 --> 00:23:24,778
And the ransom retrieved.

333
00:23:26,678 --> 00:23:30,778
Like Princess Kaguya, Ms. Renge, returns home,

334
00:23:30,778 --> 00:23:33,378
and after persuading her father,

335
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:34,878
she returns to the troupe.

336
00:23:34,878 --> 00:23:37,178
Now, she travels around the country performing

337
00:23:37,178 --> 00:23:39,078
with Mr. Tamanosuke and the group.

338
00:23:43,978 --> 00:23:47,678
It was also a new start

339
00:23:47,678 --> 00:23:51,478
for both Mr. Tamanosuke and Ms. Renge.

340
00:24:31,905 --> 00:24:33,905
Next Conan's Hint:

341
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:36,205
"Down and across"

342
00:24:36,205 --> 00:24:38,605
I'm the star in the next episode bringing you a Cinderella story.

343
00:24:38,605 --> 00:24:40,905
-Please don't fight over me... -Thank you for your hard work!
