1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,824
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,824 --> 00:00:04,624
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,624 --> 00:00:06,224
The abduction case is more than what it seems.

4
00:00:06,224 --> 00:00:08,224
But as we look into the mysteries, their motive becomes clear.

5
00:00:08,224 --> 00:00:09,824
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,824 --> 00:00:11,724
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,724 --> 00:00:13,724
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:02,470
We went to participate in a tennis tournament at Kunamoto.

9
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,970
After finding a cell phone that someone had dropped,

10
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,270
Ran and Sanoko went to deliver it back to the owner.

11
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,570
But there, Ran unable to defend herself...

12
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,270
and was kidnapped by someone.

13
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:30,770
"Smash of Love and Resolve (Part 2)"

14
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,570
We've kidnapped a high school girl called Ran Mouri.

15
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,070
If you want her back safely, get 50 million yen ready.

16
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,170
Take that money

17
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,170
and get on the Amakusa Pearl Line Cruiser departing at 3:00 pm.

18
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,170
We'll contact you again from there.

19
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,470
Darn.

20
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,870
Fifty million yen is totally impossible.

21
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,070
Moreover, it's only 2 hours till 3:00 pm.

22
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,770
Mr. Mouri.

23
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,870
Mr. Mouri, about that...

24
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,970
After hearing your name, a local big shot has offered to help.

25
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,870
I want to thank you for that.

26
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,570
Then, let me take the money.

27
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,270
No, that's not...

28
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,470
Please. Let me take it.

29
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,370
I can't just sit here and do nothing, I can't take it.

30
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,770
All right.

31
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,070
But, you've got to give me your word that you won't do anything rash,

32
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,470
and that you'll follow our orders.

33
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,670
Okay. I owe you one.

34
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:40,870
"Kumamoto Prefectural Police Department"

35
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,370
You don't seem to like the idea.

36
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,670
Ai.

37
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,070
You're thinking that it's not just a plain kidnapping case, right?

38
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,570
Right.

39
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:00,570
Why'd the kidnapper call the police department directly?

40
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,970
It's strange because normally no criminal

41
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,270
would want to get in touch with the police

42
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,270
if at all possible.

43
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,570
Besides, there's two hours to go

44
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,670
before the money is to be handed over.

45
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,870
It's as if they're giving the police to get their men together.

46
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,970
Right.

47
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,370
And, there's one more thing...

48
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,570
The last words Ran mentioned over the phone.

49
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,970
They were saying that they're going to kill somebody today...

50
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:26,970
Which means...

51
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,670
That the kidnapping is just a sham,

52
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,970
and there's a possibility that they kidnapped Ran

53
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,670
so that their murder plan wouldn't be revealed.

54
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,670
Which means that even if the ransom is paid,

55
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,070
that won't guarantee that they'll let her go.

56
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,770
Yeah.

57
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,070
However, although it would've been really simple

58
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,970
to shut Ran up on the spot,

59
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,470
they went out of their way to kidnap her.

60
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,570
So, they just may let her free.

61
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,170
I guess so.

62
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,670
First priority is to figure out where Ran is being confined.

63
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,770
Once that's done, everything will co me to light.

64
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,770
Right.

65
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,470
Bad news.

66
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,370
Conan is nowhere in sight.

67
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,170
-What? -Come to think of it, neither is Ai.

68
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,970
Ai too?

69
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:17,670
Really, and the semi-finals is going to be starting soon.

70
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,370
Maybe...

71
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,270
Maybe they both went to look for Ran.

72
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,370
No good, there're no clues to the kidnappers left.

73
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,470
Nobody seems to have heard of a place called Hirukomachi either.

74
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,870
Darn.

75
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:36,270
I searched the internet and hit several sites, though?

76
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,270
But they are all far and most likely not what we're looking for.

77
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:44,870
Yeah. It took them an hour to call after kidnapping Ran.

78
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,870
If they're traveling by car,

79
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,970
they are within a radius of 40 km.

80
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,070
If there is no place call Hirukomachi within that distance,

81
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:55,470
she probably read it wrong, or it's somebody's name.

82
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,470
Will you look for the name of a town that is within this distance?

83
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,970
I'll go check out all the names in the phone book.

84
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,970
Hiru, Hiru...

85
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,270
Hey. You guys.

86
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,970
We looked all over for you.

87
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,870
Hey, what about the match, you guys?

88
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,670
How rude. We're worried about Ran too.

89
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,070
Don't take us lightly.

90
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,570
Sonoko was crying at the hotel too.

91
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,570
That's it.

92
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,570
Ran, Ran...

93
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,570
Answer the phone. Please.

94
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,570
Come on, you're a detective's daughter, aren't you?

95
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,970
Ran?

96
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,670
It's you, Conan.

97
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:44,870
Sonoko, about that cell phone that you picked up...

98
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,170
Is there anything else you noticed about it besides the mail?

99
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,270
Come to think of it...

100
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,470
Just before we reached the coffee shop were supposed to meet,

101
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,170
a mail came in.

102
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,670
Come on, why didn't you mention that earlier?

103
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,970
What was it about?

104
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,570
Well... It was kind of strange.

105
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,970
Sonoko, if you can't make it today,

106
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,370
please go offer incense by yourself on the memorial day of his death.

107
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,970
And don't forget to take the sunflower

108
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,570
that is growing behind the factory in Yokomachi.

109
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,970
That's what the content said.

110
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,270
On the other side of the sunflowers,

111
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,270
there is a sign.

112
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,970
It's Yokomachi.

113
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,370
Yokomachi, Yokomachi...

114
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,770
Here it is. It's written "Hirunoko"

115
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,470
but read Yokomachi Clinic.

116
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,070
I found it.

117
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,470
Conan, what's up?

118
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,470
Hey, are you listening?

119
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,370
Hey, how dare you hang up like that on me?

120
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,670
Come to think of it...

121
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,170
"The sunflower..." -The sunflowers that Ran saw...

122
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,970
Oh no.

123
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,670
"Cruise ship docks"

124
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,870
"Cruise ship docks and sourvenir shop"

125
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,870
"Cruise ship ticket booth"

126
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,070
Hold on a just a while longer, Ran.

127
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,570
"Akira Doi (25), Factory Worker"

128
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,770
Now, the semi-finals are finally about to begin.

129
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,770
Who is going to win the first match?

130
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,370
Will it be Masato Tachikawa?

131
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,170
Or will it be the new star of hope, Kyohei Umabuchi?

132
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,070
Both contestants are exchanging a firm hand shake now.

133
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,670
Masato Tachikawa is his usually composed self.

134
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:33,170
On the contrary, his opponent, Kyohei Umabuchi is full of fighting spirit.

135
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,270
As would be most fitting for the first match,

136
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,170
the finals start off with both contestants who belong to this locale.

137
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,370
Don't move.

138
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,270
"Hideki Mamiya (25), Factory Worker" -You'd better stay still or,

139
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,370
you see this.

140
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,770
"Yokomachi"

141
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,470
Thanks for the lift.

142
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,270
Yeah, take care.

143
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,670
There it is, the sunflower field.

144
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,270
Okay. Here goes the Youth Detective Squad.

145
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,070
Win. You've got to win.

146
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,970
The Youth Detective Squad is here.

147
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,370
Are you all right, Ran?

148
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,370
Thank you, Conan.

149
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,570
I'm glad.

150
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,170
It's good to know you're okay.

151
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,570
Sorry to keep you waiting.

152
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,470
Thank you everybody.

153
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,870
Right. We've got big trouble.

154
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,970
These men were saying,

155
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,070
"Today's the only chance to kill that guy."

156
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,370
We've got to get the police right away.

157
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,370
Today's the only chance?

158
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,770
What?

159
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,770
Hideki, how could you? You let her get you?

160
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,370
Darn.

161
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,470
It's hurt.

162
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,170
Get a taste of your own medicine.

163
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,270
Okay. Leave the rest to us.

164
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,270
Stay still.

165
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,670
Case closed.

166
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,570
Yes.

167
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,870
What? Really?

168
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,870
All right, we'll be right there.

169
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,470
Mr. Mouri.

170
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,270
You don't have to board the cruiser anymore.

171
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,170
What's taking the police so long?

172
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,170
You're right.

173
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,670
By the way, who were you guys thinking of killing?

174
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,170
If you don't want to tell me, I'll tell you.

175
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,870
If today's the only chance you have to kill him,

176
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,370
it must be somebody who is involved in today's tournament.

177
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,470
You were watching the TV broadcast too, besides.

178
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,070
When I checked out this map, I didn't notice anything but,

179
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,670
the person who gave us a lift was saying...

180
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,870
that this iron factory is the possession of Kenzo Narimasu,

181
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,770
the host of the tennis tournament.

182
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:21,870
I'll bet you were asked to kill somebody by Mr. Narimasu, right?

183
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,270
Why should we team up with a guy like that?

184
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,670
Stupid. Don't talk.

185
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:31,170
Which means you were planning to kill Mr. Narimasu after all, right?

186
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,370
What's the matter?

187
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,970
The place that they hit me when they kidnapped me

188
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,170
is starting to hurt.

189
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,970
Hey, are you all right?

190
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:47,270
Conan, there's another criminal. The one who hit me.

191
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,470
What?

192
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,070
You mean the one they call Sonoko?

193
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,070
No, I think it was a man.

194
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,570
When I passed out, I heard the voice of another man.

195
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,170
Maybe that man is still...

196
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,370
He is after Mr. Narimasu's life.

197
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,680
What?

198
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,680
Cancel the tennis match and protect Mr. Narimasu?

199
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,080
Yes, because besides the men who are here,

200
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,680
there is one more of them,

201
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,380
and that man is after Mr. Narimasu's life.

202
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,980
Wait a minute.

203
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:31,980
So, what you're saying is this was not a kidnap for ransom?

204
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,580
No. But, there's no time now to go into detail.

205
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,080
You've got to hurry or Mr. Narimasu's life is in danger.

206
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,380
Okay. You're going to have to give me the details later, though.

207
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,680
Officer Tamana.

208
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,080
Okay, I'll see to it that they do so immediately.

209
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,480
You have got to be kidding.

210
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,880
"Kenzo Narimasu (60)" -My political life rests on this tournament.

211
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,680
"Congressman" -I'm not going to let the police interfere this tournament

212
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,180
just for their own convenience.

213
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,280
But, your life is being endangered...

214
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,580
Shut up.

215
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,480
That's why I hire them and pay them a lot of money to protect me.

216
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,280
I'm not canceling the tournament.

217
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,280
We're continuing the match as is.

218
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,380
Strange, they're not canceling the match.

219
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,980
I wonder what's going on?

220
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,380
Hey, Conan.

221
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,080
Mr. Narimasu.

222
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,780
What a match.

223
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,580
Do you have any comments as host of this tournament?

224
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,080
Well, I guess this is above all riches and fame,

225
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,780
I couldn't ask for more as a host.

226
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,780
It seems that my life is being sought after,

227
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,280
however I, Narimasu will not be intimidated by such threats.

228
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,280
What?

229
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,980
I am firmly determined to throw my life out

230
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,880
for the local citizens of Kumamoto.

231
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,180
No.

232
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,380
So, who will be going to the award stand

233
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,780
to receive the honorable championship trophy

234
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,680
from the chairman of this tournament Kenzo Narimasu?

235
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,580
Will it be Masato Tachikawa?

236
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,680
Or will it be Kyohei Umabuchi?

237
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,780
What shall we do, Conan?

238
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,380
Too bad. Your efforts have gone down the drain.

239
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,580
I'll tell you something good.

240
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,880
That guy, Narimasu doesn't give a darn about people coming after his life,

241
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,380
because he's spending a lot of money to keep himself protected.

242
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,380
Right.

243
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,280
If they're only after his life,

244
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,880
it doesn't have to be today.

245
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,880
Because even today, he is in fact, being protected by his bodyguards.

246
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,480
But, according to Ran, they were saying

247
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,080
that today's the only chance they have of carrying out the murder.

248
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,880
Why? Why is it today?

249
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,880
Sonoko.

250
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,680
Maybe the one called Sonoko can stop them?

251
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:57,580
Because wasn't Sonoko against this idea?

252
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,580
Didn't you two actually want Sonoko to stop you

253
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,780
from going through with this?

254
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,180
Isn't that why you sent her that mail?

255
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,580
Shut up. We're avenging his death.

256
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,880
Besides, Sonoko's the one who was most maltreated

257
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,480
by Narimasu among all of us.

258
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,480
That's why this is also for Sonoko's sake too.

259
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,080
But, wasn't already trying to forget everything already?

260
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,880
Maybe that's why she was against this plan?

261
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,780
Hey.

262
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,480
Isn't he Mr. Narimasu's secretary,

263
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,880
Mr. Saiki, who committed suicide the other day?

264
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,180
So, that's the story after all.

265
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,680
Today is Mr. Saiki's memorial day, isn't it?

266
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,180
You all used to visit his grave together, right?

267
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,080
I think Sonoko is waiting for you at the grave.

268
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,680
I'm sure she's waiting for you both to come.

269
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,380
She believes that you'll drop this plan

270
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,280
and come to his grave,

271
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,980
where she's waiting.

272
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,780
It's too late.

273
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,880
Maybe Sonoko could've stopped this plan.

274
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,280
But, no more, not from now.

275
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,680
Hey, Hideki.

276
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,980
The match has already gone this far.

277
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,380
You idiot.

278
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,380
What?

279
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,680
That's it folks, this is the last game,

280
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,180
whether you like it or not.

281
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,780
Tachikawa serves the ball.

282
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,480
I see. I got it.

283
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,980
Now I know why it's got to be carried out today.

284
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,580
So, who will be the one going up to the award stand

285
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,980
to receive the honorable championship trophy

286
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,280
from the chairman of this tournament Kenzo Narimasu?

287
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,080
The bodyguards are going to be some distance away

288
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,180
for just an instant during this match.

289
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,080
But, which of them is it?

290
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,680
Which of them is the killer?

291
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,880
They're both from this locale.

292
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,780
They're ages are more or less the same.

293
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,080
Which of them is it?

294
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,980
Which of them on earth is it?

295
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,180
Darn.

296
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,680
What is it?

297
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,980
This is...

298
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,680
I found him.

299
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,680
The killer is him.

300
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,280
It's a chopper.

301
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,380
I'm sure it's the police.

302
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,580
Ran!

303
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,380
Hey, Ran!

304
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
Are you okay, Ran?

305
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,280
I'm fine. I'm okay.

306
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,980
I'm sorry, Ran!

307
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,680
I'll bet you were scared.

308
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,980
Sonoko!

309
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:35,280
I can understand why you want to kill Mr. Narimasu,

310
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,380
but I'm still not convinced.

311
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,780
A brat like you would never understand how we feel.

312
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,780
Yeah, I don't even want to know how it feels.

313
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,280
Who cares about how somebody feels

314
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,380
about wanting to kill somebody else?

315
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,580
Darn, who the heck are you anyway?

316
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,380
I'm Conan Edogawa, a detective.

317
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,380
Officer. Please head for the tennis tournament grounds immediately.

318
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,780
I've figured out who the other criminal is.

319
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,180
What?

320
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,080
We've got to hurry, or we won't make it in time.

321
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:19,280
We will now award the winner with the championship trophy.

322
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,380
Winner, Mr. Masato Tachikawa.

323
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,480
You have achieved outstanding performance

324
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:33,280
at the memorable First Land of Fire Cup Charity Tennis Tournament

325
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,280
and will be awarded the Championship Cup.

326
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,480
Mr. Tachikawa, please step up to the award stand.

327
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,780
Congratulations.

328
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,580
It's been a long time, Mr. Narimasu.

329
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,380
I wonder where I have seen you before?

330
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,880
I'm Tachikawa, who was working under Mr. Saiki

331
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,180
at your factory 10 years ago.

332
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:13,180
10 years ago under Saiki...

333
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,980
Don't tell me that you're...

334
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,880
So, you finally remember.

335
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,080
I'm Masato Tachikawa, who was slave driven at your factory

336
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,880
without being paid decently either.

337
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,080
Don't move.

338
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,880
I was worried when I heard that Mr. Saiki became your secretary

339
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,880
when you became a congressman.

340
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,280
I'll bet you pushed all your wrongdoings onto Mr. Saiki

341
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,580
and killed him, right?

342
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,780
No. Saiki committed suicide.

343
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,780
You made him commit suicide, didn't you?

344
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,680
Darn, how dare you kill such a good person...

345
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,680
10 years ago, when we fled from your factory,

346
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,980
Mr. Saiki's the one who stopped us from taking revenge on you.

347
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,980
But, we should've killed you back then.

348
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,680
If we did, Mr. Saiki wouldn't have had to die.

349
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,180
Don't... please don't.

350
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,680
Go to the world beyond and apologize to Mr. Saiki!

351
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,180
Masato Tachikawa.

352
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,380
Throw down your weapon and let the hostage go.

353
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,580
Shut up, if you come any closer...

354
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,280
Masato, please don't.

355
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,780
It's me, Sonoko.

356
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,580
Sonoko.

357
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,680
Let's stop all this already, Masato.

358
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,080
Today's Mr. Saiki's memorial day.

359
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:44,180
He'll be lonely if we don't go visit his grave all together.

360
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:48,580
Okay? Let's all go together, please.

361
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,880
Sonoko.

362
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,780
No. Please.

363
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,680
The tennis that Mr. Saiki approved of,

364
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,580
your tennis is going to get all messed up.

365
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:04,380
Mr. Saiki was really happy when you became a pro tennis player, remember?

366
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,780
Please don't do anything to make him sad.

367
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,780
Masato.

368
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,980
"Congressman Narimasu Arrested"

369
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,080
Three days later,

370
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,880
congressman Narimasu was arrested on charges of bribery.

371
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,880
It also said in the papers that further investigation

372
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,380
will be conducted as to the truth

373
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,180
behind his secretary Saiki's suicide.

374
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,280
"Congressman Narimasu's True Intentions"

375
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,780
All seems to have ended well.

376
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,080
However, Ai and I have to take responsibility

377
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,480
for losing our chance to win the finals...

378
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,780
No, the semi-finals, that is.

379
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,480
Oh boy.

380
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,580
Conan, shape up.

381
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,880
Break a leg!

382
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,880
You've got three more laps to go.

383
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,380
I'll keep you company.

384
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,380
I guess I'll go take a run too.

385
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,380
Hey.

386
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,580
Good morning, Ai.

387
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,580
Shall we go run too?

388
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,080
Wait for me.

389
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,880
Let's go.

390
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,480
Oh, brother.

391
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,440
Next Conan Hint:

392
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,820
"Carbon make fishing rod"
