1
00:00:02,227 --> 00:00:08,627
Tohru Amuro, who got to know since the DNA case some days ago

2
00:00:08,627 --> 00:00:15,727
claimed Raita Nanba, Pops' friend as being the culprit,

3
00:00:15,727 --> 00:00:17,027
but Pops on the contrary,

4
00:00:17,027 --> 00:00:22,001
proves that this was not homicide, but a suicide case.

5
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:25,727
Amuro, who is deeply impressed by Pops' deduction

6
00:00:25,727 --> 00:00:27,027
decides to part-time at Poirot

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,627
that is located below the detective agency,

8
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:33,727
and learn detective work under Pops.

9
00:00:36,527 --> 00:00:38,327
The vivid colored memories of summer.

10
00:00:38,327 --> 00:00:40,327
Solve mysteries all season round.

11
00:00:40,327 --> 00:00:42,021
Going to and fro the detective agency.

12
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:44,427
An unbelievable occurrence in the wink of an eye.

13
00:00:44,427 --> 00:00:46,025
He sees through the one and only truth.

14
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:48,027
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

15
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:50,029
His name is Detective Conan.

16
00:02:31,422 --> 00:02:37,022
"Nocturne of the Detectives (The Case)"

17
00:02:38,722 --> 00:02:40,622
This is the image of the three bank robbers

18
00:02:40,622 --> 00:02:44,143
that has been publicized this time.

19
00:02:44,143 --> 00:02:47,422
Now, these three are still on the run and...

20
00:02:47,422 --> 00:02:51,822
I tell you, all they've been airing since this morning is this news.

21
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:53,422
It can't be helped.

22
00:02:53,422 --> 00:02:56,822
It's only been less than a week since the incident occurred, and moreover,

23
00:02:56,822 --> 00:03:00,159
it seems that one banker was shot to death too.

24
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,122
If I remember correctly, the guy was killed because he tried to be cool

25
00:03:03,122 --> 00:03:05,322
and went up against the robbers or something.

26
00:03:05,322 --> 00:03:08,167
I don't think he went against the robbers.

27
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:11,922
According to one of the customers who was at the bank at that time,

28
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:15,722
he raised his hands like this and said, "Okay, cut it out already"

29
00:03:15,722 --> 00:03:18,177
and tried to calm the robbers down.

30
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:21,922
But, it's all the same if he did what he did and got the robbers angry,

31
00:03:21,922 --> 00:03:24,183
then got shot to death.

32
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:28,187
But, you sure can't do bad things, can you?

33
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:30,189
After all, the 200 million yen

34
00:03:30,422 --> 00:03:33,522
that was just brought in from the main bank were all new bills,

35
00:03:33,522 --> 00:03:36,722
so the numbers on the bills were clearly identifiable.

36
00:03:36,722 --> 00:03:40,722
Yeah, they got a bunch of money they can't use.

37
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:44,822
So it's just a matter of time until the robbers get caught.

38
00:03:45,822 --> 00:03:48,622
I mean, how come you're here?

39
00:03:48,622 --> 00:03:50,822
I came to bring you, Mr. Mouri,

40
00:03:50,822 --> 00:03:53,322
the one who's taking care of me, sandwiches for lunch.

41
00:03:53,322 --> 00:03:56,215
Of course it's on me.

42
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:58,722
You mean there's some for us too?

43
00:03:58,722 --> 00:04:00,219
Well, of course!

44
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:01,722
Thank you very much.

45
00:04:01,722 --> 00:04:05,622
No problem, if for Mouri Sensei, this is nothing.

46
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:09,022
What a carefree character.

47
00:04:09,022 --> 00:04:13,022
And, the client that's coming today, what kind of case is it?

48
00:04:13,022 --> 00:04:15,922
What? Why do you know about it?

49
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,822
Of course I know about it.

50
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:20,522
Well, on holiday afternoons you usually spend your time

51
00:04:20,522 --> 00:04:23,622
slacking off with a horse racing newspaper in hand.

52
00:04:23,622 --> 00:04:28,247
But today, you're clean shaven and wearing a necktie.

53
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:31,822
It's as if you're waiting for someone to come over.

54
00:04:31,822 --> 00:04:34,253
Just as expected of you, Mr. Amuro.

55
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:37,722
At this rate, there's no need to practice your skills under Dad.

56
00:04:37,722 --> 00:04:42,622
Oh, no. This is all thanks to teachings from Mr. Mouri.

57
00:04:42,622 --> 00:04:45,322
You're doing quite well, Amuro.

58
00:04:45,322 --> 00:04:48,267
Thank you very much.

59
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:54,273
Moreover, Yoko Okino's supposed to be on air now.

60
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:56,275
Despite this, you're not watching it,

61
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:58,922
and seem to be straining your nerves,

62
00:04:58,922 --> 00:05:01,922
so it must be some great case that you've got on your hands.

63
00:05:05,822 --> 00:05:08,722
Go! Go! Let's go! Let's go, Yoko!

64
00:05:08,722 --> 00:05:12,291
This is...

65
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,293
He changed the time he was supposed to meet the client

66
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:16,622
just so that he could watch this live.

67
00:05:16,622 --> 00:05:19,722
Go! Yoko!

68
00:05:19,722 --> 00:05:22,301
Pops is really carefree too.

69
00:05:25,322 --> 00:05:28,307
Tune in next week for the goodwill soccer match.

70
00:05:30,722 --> 00:05:36,722
So was I right about the client showing up soon?

71
00:05:37,722 --> 00:05:38,822
Yeah.

72
00:05:38,822 --> 00:05:42,321
But I don't know what kind of person's coming.

73
00:05:44,122 --> 00:05:46,822
Because after all, this is the first client

74
00:05:46,822 --> 00:05:48,922
who came through the internet requesting work to be done.

75
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:50,622
"Mouri Detective Agency"

76
00:05:50,622 --> 00:05:53,722
So you set up your detective agency website?

77
00:05:53,722 --> 00:05:55,322
Just as expected of you, Mouri Sensei.

78
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:57,022
You're capable of doing something like this too.

79
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:58,922
Well, sort of.

80
00:05:58,922 --> 00:06:01,522
I thought that it was about time that we go

81
00:06:01,522 --> 00:06:04,722
in keeping with the global world and turn to digital, you know.

82
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:08,622
Well, I'm the one who made the website, though.

83
00:06:08,622 --> 00:06:13,422
All I have to do now is enter the password.

84
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:17,822
Conan, you're really something.

85
00:06:17,822 --> 00:06:20,359
Doc taught me how to do it.

86
00:06:22,722 --> 00:06:25,622
So, now that the live broadcast is over.

87
00:06:25,622 --> 00:06:28,822
It's about time that the client gets here.

88
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:32,822
Mail?

89
00:06:32,822 --> 00:06:34,373
Let see.

90
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:38,377
"I'm Kei Kashizuka who was scheduled to meet you there today,

91
00:06:38,622 --> 00:06:40,922
but I would like to change the meeting place

92
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:44,122
to Restaurant Colombo because of personal reasons.

93
00:06:44,122 --> 00:06:46,385
The restaurant is quite near from there,

94
00:06:46,622 --> 00:06:49,422
and I'm sure that I can meet you on time.

95
00:06:49,422 --> 00:06:52,722
I will be waiting to hear from you whether this is okay or not", it says.

96
00:06:52,722 --> 00:06:54,922
Humbug.

97
00:06:54,922 --> 00:06:56,395
Maybe I should just refuse.

98
00:06:56,395 --> 00:07:00,022
No, Dad! It's a client, you know.

99
00:07:00,022 --> 00:07:02,922
Besides, Conan and I haven't eaten lunch yet,

100
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,922
so we could eat at Colombo.

101
00:07:04,922 --> 00:07:07,222
Okay, then. What about these sandwiches?

102
00:07:07,222 --> 00:07:12,022
We'll keep this in the refrigerator and have it for dinner.

103
00:07:14,722 --> 00:07:16,922
Sandwiches for dinner?

104
00:07:16,922 --> 00:07:20,822
Dad, the ashes from your cigarette's going to fall.

105
00:07:20,822 --> 00:07:23,322
Hey, Dad! Be careful, will you!

106
00:07:23,322 --> 00:07:25,822
What if it catches fire?

107
00:07:25,822 --> 00:07:29,222
Well, but thanks to someone slacking off in this house,

108
00:07:29,222 --> 00:07:31,022
we're into hot water even without the help of fire, I guess!

109
00:07:31,022 --> 00:07:33,322
Oh, nice play on words.

110
00:07:33,322 --> 00:07:36,435
Then, will it be alright for me

111
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:39,922
to accompany you when you meet this client, Mouri Sensei?

112
00:07:39,922 --> 00:07:42,722
My shift at Poirot today is till afternoon.

113
00:07:42,722 --> 00:07:45,922
Oh, yeah, I don't mind.

114
00:07:45,922 --> 00:07:49,122
If you're coming with me, pay tuition like you should!

115
00:07:49,122 --> 00:07:51,622
Well, of course!

116
00:07:55,422 --> 00:07:57,922
Okay, Mouri Sensei.

117
00:07:57,922 --> 00:07:59,622
You go on ahead,

118
00:07:59,622 --> 00:08:02,461
I'll go get my coat and meet you there.

119
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,822
"Colombo Restaurant"

120
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:13,722
The key of a coin locker?

121
00:08:13,722 --> 00:08:15,722
Yeah. It seems that the key was found among

122
00:08:15,722 --> 00:08:17,522
the belongings of the late older brother,

123
00:08:17,522 --> 00:08:20,022
who passed away the other day.

124
00:08:20,022 --> 00:08:22,481
Since the client couldn't figure out which locker the key was for,

125
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:24,483
he wants me to figure it out.

126
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:25,722
If it's for something important,

127
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:28,487
he wants to put it in the coffin of his brother, he says.

128
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:31,022
But can you figure it out?

129
00:08:31,022 --> 00:08:34,493
Keys usually have the manufacturer's name and serial number on them,

130
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:36,495
so it shouldn't be too difficult to figure out,

131
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:38,497
if I can get a hold of the company

132
00:08:38,497 --> 00:08:40,522
and ask them where they delivered the locker,

133
00:08:40,522 --> 00:08:44,222
we'll get a general idea of where it is.

134
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:46,505
It much easier than I thought.

135
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:48,507
I guess.

136
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:53,522
Is that all there is to it, your client's request?

137
00:08:53,522 --> 00:08:56,515
Yeah, and the client's offering me 300,000 yen for it,

138
00:08:56,722 --> 00:08:58,022
so it's a great job, don't you think?

139
00:08:58,022 --> 00:08:59,622
True.

140
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,521
If so, why say it's humbug?

141
00:09:13,222 --> 00:09:16,022
The client is not here yet.

142
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,122
Yeah.

143
00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:21,522
Maybe there's another restaurant by the name of Colombo near here?

144
00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:23,822
No, there isn't.

145
00:09:23,822 --> 00:09:26,545
You sent an okay mail back to the mail

146
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:28,822
that asked if you would agree to change the meeting place, right?

147
00:09:28,822 --> 00:09:32,122
Yeah! I answered right away.

148
00:09:32,122 --> 00:09:36,122
I'm repeatedly sending mail saying, "I'll be waiting for you there."

149
00:09:36,122 --> 00:09:38,122
But, I'm getting no response.

150
00:09:38,122 --> 00:09:39,422
I see.

151
00:09:40,922 --> 00:09:42,822
The mail address of the mail I got last night,

152
00:09:42,822 --> 00:09:46,565
and the mail I received a while ago is different.

153
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:47,422
What?

154
00:09:47,422 --> 00:09:50,822
Maybe the client's cell phone is being charge

155
00:09:50,822 --> 00:09:52,571
and so he had to borrow his friend's cell phone

156
00:09:52,822 --> 00:09:55,422
to rush and send the text mail a while ago?

157
00:09:55,422 --> 00:09:59,522
And that friend switched off the power of the cell phone or something?

158
00:09:59,522 --> 00:10:01,922
Hey, I sent the okay mail

159
00:10:01,922 --> 00:10:04,222
to the text mail I received a while ago, you know.

160
00:10:04,222 --> 00:10:06,322
If so, then maybe he's still waiting

161
00:10:06,322 --> 00:10:09,922
at the detective agency, the first meeting place,

162
00:10:09,922 --> 00:10:12,222
unaware of the okay mail that came in.

163
00:10:12,222 --> 00:10:15,022
Well, there's no one waiting there.

164
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:17,022
True.

165
00:10:17,022 --> 00:10:18,597
I did send a mail, "I'll be right back"

166
00:10:18,822 --> 00:10:21,522
to the first mail address, though.

167
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:24,922
Then, I'm sure he'll be answering you soon.

168
00:10:24,922 --> 00:10:26,605
Why don't I get some tea and we'll wait while having tea?

169
00:10:26,822 --> 00:10:30,022
Okay. Since I drank too much coffee at Colombo.

170
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:31,522
I've got to go to the restroom.

171
00:10:31,522 --> 00:10:34,613
Oh, Ran, I'll help you make tea.

172
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:37,522
Thanks. Then can you get the teacups?

173
00:10:37,522 --> 00:10:39,122
With pleasure.

174
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:47,322
Reply from the client!

175
00:10:47,322 --> 00:10:50,622
He says he arrived at Colombo just now, so he'd like me to go there.

176
00:10:50,622 --> 00:10:52,622
If so, we'd better rush over!

177
00:10:52,622 --> 00:10:55,322
-Yeah. -I'll go with you,

178
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,422
so wait for me, will you!

179
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:59,722
I've got to go to the restroom first.

180
00:11:01,122 --> 00:11:03,622
Mail from the client again.

181
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:06,645
He says for all of us to rush over.

182
00:11:06,822 --> 00:11:09,522
All of us? You mean us too?

183
00:11:09,522 --> 00:11:11,622
Who else is there?

184
00:11:11,622 --> 00:11:15,122
Then, let's all scoot back to Colombo together.

185
00:11:15,122 --> 00:11:16,922
Come, come, everyone, let's hurry.

186
00:11:16,922 --> 00:11:20,922
So! We'd better hurry or the client will get impatient.

187
00:11:20,922 --> 00:11:24,222
Really, I mean, I think it'll suffice for just me to go and yet!

188
00:11:24,222 --> 00:11:25,222
Well...

189
00:11:25,222 --> 00:11:28,667
But, he's saying everybody, right?

190
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:33,422
Be quiet, everyone.

191
00:11:33,422 --> 00:11:35,922
I'm sure this is how the story goes.

192
00:11:35,922 --> 00:11:39,622
Someone who didn't want the client to see you,

193
00:11:39,622 --> 00:11:42,681
lured you out using fake mail.

194
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:44,683
After the agency was emptied out, that certain someone set himself up

195
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:47,022
as an imposter as one of your employees,

196
00:11:47,022 --> 00:11:49,422
and waited at the agency for the client to appear.

197
00:11:51,022 --> 00:11:52,691
As proof of that.

198
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:56,695
There are traces of the lock being forced open on the keyhole of this door.

199
00:11:56,922 --> 00:11:59,222
And, in the dish cabinet in the kitchen,

200
00:11:59,222 --> 00:12:02,322
there was a slightly wet teacup.

201
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,022
Judging from your personality, Ran,

202
00:12:04,022 --> 00:12:06,122
You would never put set dishes back into the cabinet

203
00:12:06,122 --> 00:12:07,522
without wiping them, would you?

204
00:12:07,522 --> 00:12:08,707
No.

205
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:14,713
Besides, the ashes that Pop's dropped on the table before we left

206
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:16,715
is wiped clean.

207
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:21,022
Isn't it because someone wiped it off while all of us were out?

208
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:24,723
In other words, these are traces of someone

209
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:28,222
having invited the client in, cleaned the table

210
00:12:28,222 --> 00:12:30,729
and served tea.

211
00:12:30,922 --> 00:12:34,322
Since the teacup was put back without being completely wiped,

212
00:12:34,322 --> 00:12:37,022
it was still wet.

213
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,122
But why would someone do something like that?

214
00:12:39,122 --> 00:12:42,522
Because all the client wanted, was to look for the coin locker.

215
00:12:42,522 --> 00:12:45,522
Maybe something unthinkable is inside the locker?

216
00:12:45,522 --> 00:12:46,745
I wonder about that.

217
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:48,222
Why don't we...

218
00:12:49,622 --> 00:12:52,422
ask the person himself?

219
00:12:52,422 --> 00:12:53,622
The person himself?

220
00:12:53,622 --> 00:12:55,122
Don't tell me that...

221
00:12:55,122 --> 00:12:57,522
You got a reply mail just as you were about

222
00:12:57,522 --> 00:12:59,722
to go to the restroom, didn't you, Sensei?

223
00:12:59,722 --> 00:13:03,122
And, just when Conan was about to go to the restroom too.

224
00:13:03,122 --> 00:13:06,022
Moreover, on the floor of the restroom

225
00:13:06,022 --> 00:13:08,767
there was a trace of something having been dragged along!

226
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:10,122
What?

227
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,022
Right.

228
00:13:12,022 --> 00:13:13,922
Most probably that someone for some reason,

229
00:13:13,922 --> 00:13:16,422
has the client with him

230
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:18,777
and is still here

231
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:21,822
hiding inside the restroom.

232
00:13:24,522 --> 00:13:26,785
Don't tell me...

233
00:13:30,022 --> 00:13:31,622
What?

234
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,803
Then, is this what you're saying?

235
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:48,807
Ms. Kei Kashizuka, you came here

236
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:52,350
to have Mr. Mouri investigate the coin locker case,

237
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,350
but were welcomed in by someone who called himself Mr. Mouri's disciple,

238
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,450
and fainted after being attacked with a stun gun.

239
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,350
When you came to, you were tied up with masking tape

240
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,821
and shoved into the restroom.

241
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,823
Yes.

242
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:07,150
My boots including my shoelaces were removed

243
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,550
so that I wouldn't be able to flee.

244
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,650
After Mouri and the others came back,

245
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,750
the man who thought that they found you

246
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,050
confined in the restroom, panicked,

247
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:23,350
put the gun in his mouth and committed suicide?

248
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,450
Yes.

249
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:28,550
But, why did that man hide you in the restroom?

250
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,851
I was being questioned right through,

251
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,150
what locker this key was for?

252
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,250
He said he would kill me if I didn't tell him.

253
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,861
Inspector Megure.

254
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:44,350
According to forensics,

255
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,850
virtually no traces of discharge residue

256
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,550
were found on her clothes or her body.

257
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,550
In other words, that man committed suicide.

258
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:56,050
Does that mean that Ms. Kashizuka's testimony is fact.

259
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,050
Yes, sir, it's most likely.

260
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,150
Okay!

261
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:02,050
First of all, let's find where the locker is located

262
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,350
and find out what the guy who committed suicide was after.

263
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,050
Yes, sir!

264
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,050
However, I don't understand.

265
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:20,899
Why did this man bring Ms. Kashizuka in here?

266
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,550
All he wanted to do was to ask her

267
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:26,650
where the locker of this key was, wasn't it?

268
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,250
That's right.

269
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,150
He could've threatened her using a gun,

270
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,950
moved somewhere else and interrogate her,

271
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,913
but instead he passed her out using a stun gun,

272
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:36,915
and tied her up with masking tape.

273
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:42,050
This could mean that he was planning to stay confined here for a while.

274
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:46,250
And of all things, he kills himself with his gun.

275
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,550
Well, it could be that he resigned himself

276
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:53,850
because I, Kogoro Mouri came back earlier than he expected.

277
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:58,150
You're not the one who realized that though.

278
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:01,450
He seemed really freaked out.

279
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,950
He was saying that he'd be in big trouble

280
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,650
if he couldn't find the coin locker as soon as possible.

281
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,650
But, Ms. Kashizuka,

282
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:11,650
is it really true that you've never seen that man before?

283
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,650
No, sir. Not at all.

284
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,650
If that guy was after the key

285
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,957
that was among your older brother's belongings,

286
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:22,450
it's highly probable that he could've been an acquaintance of your brother.

287
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:26,650
I haven't met any of my older brother's friends, you see.

288
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,750
By the way, why did your older brother pass away?

289
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:36,250
What was the cause of your older brother's death?

290
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,550
What was the cause of your brother's death?

291
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:42,981
Oh, yes. He died of an accident four days ago.

292
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,950
This is my older brother.

293
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:50,150
You have his picture as a standby display on your cell phone.

294
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,550
This man. He looks familiar.

295
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,450
Talking about cell phones.

296
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,350
The cell phone of this guy that committed suicide is weird.

297
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,350
Weird?

298
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,450
The mail that he sent to Mr. Mouri,

299
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,150
feigning to be Ms. Kashizuka

300
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:10,350
asking to change the place of meeting is in the mail sent history,

301
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,750
but there are no other mails at all.

302
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,750
Oh, that man. As to the mails

303
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,550
after that mail he was using my cell phone.

304
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,750
But, even so being that,

305
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,050
that is all that's left of received and sent mails is.

306
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,050
The address book is also completely blank,

307
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,050
despite it not looking to be such a new model.

308
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,550
Maybe he bought an old model cell phone at a cheap price?

309
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,650
It practically has no scratches or anything on it either.

310
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,350
Besides, the loose change and wallet

311
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,041
that were in his pocket along with the cell phone also bother me.

312
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,043
Loose change and wallet?

313
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:47,045
The loose change was in his inner pocket of his jacket

314
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:49,047
top along with the key of the locker he took from Ms. Kashizuka,

315
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:54,650
together with the stun gun, cigarette and lighter,

316
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,550
but the total amount of loose change added up to almost 5,000 yen.

317
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,450
5,000 yen?

318
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,450
With so much, wouldn't it jingle noisily and be heavy too?

319
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,650
Yeah.

320
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,650
Moreover, in his wallet there were two 10,000 yen bills,

321
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:09,050
five 5,000 yen bills.

322
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,850
And of all things, there were forty-seven 1,000 yen bills.

323
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,650
Don't you think that's weird?

324
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,073
True.

325
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:17,075
Uh, excuse me.

326
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:18,550
If it's okay with you,

327
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:22,450
could you please show me the things that were in his pocket?

328
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,083
You want to see them too, don't you, Pops?

329
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,850
Yeah, I guess so.

330
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,087
Well, go ahead.

331
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:32,550
I'm sorry to trouble you, Inspector.

332
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:39,650
So, this is all of it.

333
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,101
He had this many things inside his pocket?

334
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:44,250
Yeah.

335
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,050
Since Officer Takagi is checking

336
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,950
on the key of the locker in question just yet, it isn't here.

337
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:53,111
Come to think of it, Ms. Kashizuka.

338
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:54,150
Yes?

339
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,450
Out of the two towels that were found

340
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,150
by the feet of the dead body in the toilet,

341
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,750
the tip of one of them seem to have been wet.

342
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,650
Do you know why?

343
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,850
I have no idea. I was scared

344
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,750
and looking down all the while, you see.

345
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,350
And as to the boot that was under the towel,

346
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,133
there was a knot at the tip of the shoelace of the boot,

347
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,650
and it was hooked onto the boot.

348
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:22,350
Oh, that's my habit since I was a child.

349
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:25,750
When washing cloth sneakers, and drying them,

350
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,850
if the strings are knotted that way,

351
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,450
my brother used to tell me they'd be easier to hang.

352
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:33,950
Of course I don't wash boots, but I still have that habit.

353
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:37,850
And, my brother's not here anymore either.

354
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:43,850
Inspector. Shall we call it a day?

355
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,250
After all, it hasn't been long since she's lost her older brother, besides,

356
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,450
a man she doesn't even know committed suicide right before her eyes.

357
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,450
Okay then, I would like you to come in for interrogation tomorrow,

358
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,650
so would you please leave your contact number and address behind?

359
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,350
Yes, sir. I'll write it on something.

360
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:06,350
If possible I would like you to show me some sort of identification.

361
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,187
Since I'm a new college grad and in the process of looking for a job,

362
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:10,950
I don't have a name card.

363
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,950
But if I go home, I have my health insurance card.

364
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,350
Okay, will you bring it with you tomorrow, then?

365
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,850
All right.

366
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:22,250
Uh, if you're going home, shall I give you a lift?

367
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,950
My car is parked at a parking lot nearby.

368
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,550
Maybe that man's friends

369
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:31,209
could be ambushing you near your house too.

370
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:33,211
Thank you so much.

371
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:36,650
No problem, no need to thank me.

372
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,550
By the way, why is he here?

373
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:44,950
Well, Amuro here has become my first disciple, you see!

374
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,225
Disciple?

375
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:50,250
I tell you, really.

376
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:54,950
You mean another detective's been added around you again.

377
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,650
Again?

378
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:00,150
Yeah. There are others besides you.

379
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,950
A young woman detective

380
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,950
who's been going around the crime scenes together

381
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:07,245
with Mr. Mouri recently.

382
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,450
A young woman detective.

383
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:15,253
I would really like to see her.

384
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,339
Ms. Kashizuka, is this the road?

385
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:43,850
Yes.

386
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:44,950
Come to think of it.

387
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:48,050
This car is the same as Officer Sato's, except a different color, isn't it?

388
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,950
By the way, why are you guys riding together?

389
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,350
It's cramped in here!

390
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,750
I'm sorry.

391
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,355
This car isn't made to seat 3 people in the backseat, you see.

392
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,650
It's okay.

393
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:02,450
Why are you riding with us, Dad?

394
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:05,150
I was worried about Ms. Kei, that's why.

395
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,365
I don't feel comfortable staying back at the agency with Conan,

396
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:09,750
where a person just committed suicide.

397
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:13,050
Then, why didn't you go over to Eri's?

398
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,050
Come of it!

399
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:17,150
You came along just because Ms. Kashizuka is pretty!

400
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,050
That man.

401
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,550
I wonder if he really committed suicide.

402
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:25,950
But, there seems to have been no gun discharge residue

403
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:30,650
detected from Ms. Kashizuka's body

404
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,850
and what's even stranger is his cell phone.

405
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,850
Why was everything, except the mail that was sent to Pops

406
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:40,150
the received or sent history, including the address book all blank?

407
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,150
Besides, the things that were left back in his pocket

408
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:45,403
the loose change and bills that were in his wallet.

409
00:23:45,403 --> 00:23:50,450
Why did he have to carry around so many bills and change?

410
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,850
One more thing.

411
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,415
She's probably lying.

412
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,114
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:04,114 --> 00:24:06,000
"Wiretap"

414
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,844
-A gun is fired in the restroom. -The other day it was a hole up case.

415
00:24:08,844 --> 00:24:10,880
Is the detective agency cursed?
