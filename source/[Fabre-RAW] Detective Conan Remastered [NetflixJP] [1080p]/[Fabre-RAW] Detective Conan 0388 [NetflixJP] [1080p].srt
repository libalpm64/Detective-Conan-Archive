1
00:00:21,671 --> 00:00:23,871
Tonight's stage is in Kagoshima.

2
00:00:23,871 --> 00:00:25,871
Pops goes wild over a rare distilled spirit.

3
00:00:25,871 --> 00:00:28,071
Rice malt is the aroma of human relationship.

4
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:29,471
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,471 --> 00:00:31,071
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,071 --> 00:00:33,271
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:58,818
"Kagoshima Nichiuri TV" -Well, when one wants liquor the first thing

8
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,218
that comes to mind is beer.

9
00:02:00,218 --> 00:02:03,418
Super cold beer drank in one gulp,

10
00:02:06,818 --> 00:02:09,918
there's nothing better than it.

11
00:02:09,918 --> 00:02:12,618
What's so good about it, is of course the bitterness.

12
00:02:12,618 --> 00:02:16,818
No, rather, what I want to ask you about is not beer.

13
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:20,618
I thought I was summoned to talk passionately about liquor?

14
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:21,718
"Yuka Tokuzumi, Kagoshima Nichiuri TV Announcer" -Yes, sir.

15
00:02:21,718 --> 00:02:23,118
But about the most popular type of liquor

16
00:02:23,118 --> 00:02:25,218
that is going around now.

17
00:02:28,818 --> 00:02:31,818
Well, when it comes to the charm of wine,

18
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,718
-one cannot talk about it without mentioning -It's not wine... but...

19
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:34,918
the amount of polyphenol that it contains...

20
00:02:34,918 --> 00:02:37,618
This is an important commemorative event for our program

21
00:02:37,618 --> 00:02:39,818
"Yousuke Kondo, Shogo Yoshidome" -and what's with all the gibberish.

22
00:02:39,818 --> 00:02:42,418
Well... we asked him to come because he is quite well known

23
00:02:42,418 --> 00:02:43,718
and loves to drink.

24
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:45,418
I mean, it's so obvious when Kagoshima comes into the picture

25
00:02:45,418 --> 00:02:47,718
and it's about liquor.

26
00:02:47,718 --> 00:02:50,518
The announcer's crying.

27
00:02:50,518 --> 00:02:52,218
Dad, come on.

28
00:02:53,218 --> 00:02:55,418
What's this threatening feeling I sense

29
00:02:55,418 --> 00:02:57,418
after coming all this way to Kagoshima?

30
00:02:58,518 --> 00:02:59,918
Kagoshima...

31
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:02,718
Drinking in Kagoshima brings to mind...

32
00:03:02,718 --> 00:03:04,518
"Distilled spirits"

33
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,818
Oh, no.

34
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:11,018
Well, beer is good.

35
00:03:11,018 --> 00:03:13,718
And wine is also good, but the fact is,

36
00:03:13,718 --> 00:03:17,318
I like distilled spirits best.

37
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:20,118
Actually, I didn't want any of you out there to realize,

38
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:23,918
more than you already have, how delicious distilled spirits are.

39
00:03:23,918 --> 00:03:26,518
That's why you went out of your way to talk about other liquors?

40
00:03:26,518 --> 00:03:29,118
-Oh, so that's what it was! -Oh, so that's what it was!

41
00:03:29,118 --> 00:03:33,318
But, I, Kogoro Mouri can deceive you no longer.

42
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:34,518
Among all the distilled spirits,

43
00:03:34,518 --> 00:03:38,518
this Kagoshima made genuine distilled spirit of Satsuma...

44
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,018
is the best!

45
00:03:41,018 --> 00:03:44,818
Viva! Kagoshima!

46
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:48,418
All right, Mr. Mouri! Good job.

47
00:03:48,418 --> 00:03:50,718
We were right to invite him over, weren't we?

48
00:03:52,118 --> 00:03:54,118
He somehow made it through.

49
00:03:55,218 --> 00:03:57,018
He's an expert at that for sure.

50
00:03:58,018 --> 00:04:03,218
"Takakuma", you mean the rare spirit?

51
00:04:03,218 --> 00:04:05,818
Yes. Since the manufacturing of it is completely limited,

52
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:09,018
it is very hard to get a hold of and is the gem of all liquors.

53
00:04:09,018 --> 00:04:12,118
You mean I get to drink that?

54
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,518
We asked the brewery and they answered,

55
00:04:13,518 --> 00:04:16,318
"If for Mr. Mouri they'd be more than glad to."

56
00:04:16,318 --> 00:04:18,518
We'll cross the Gulf of Kagoshima on the ferry

57
00:04:18,518 --> 00:04:21,718
and go to a place right opposite it called "Tarumizu."

58
00:04:21,718 --> 00:04:26,218
I get to drink it, the spirit of my dreams, the rare spirit "Takakuma."

59
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:32,118
It's nothing to cry over.

60
00:04:32,118 --> 00:04:37,918
This is how we ended up getting involved with that devastating case.

61
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:45,518
"Kogoro Drunk Over Satsuma! (Part 1)"

62
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:49,618
Takakuma Sake Brewery, so this is where it's being made.

63
00:04:49,618 --> 00:04:52,318
I thought it was going to be a much bigger place.

64
00:04:52,318 --> 00:04:54,118
But, it's beautiful.

65
00:04:54,118 --> 00:04:56,218
The sea is right in front too.

66
00:04:56,218 --> 00:04:58,818
Mr. Mouri, here is the head of the family.

67
00:04:58,818 --> 00:05:02,018
I'm sorry to intrude on you suddenly like this.

68
00:05:02,018 --> 00:05:03,918
I'm Kogoro Mouri.

69
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:06,818
"Satoshi Shiraishi (30)" -Thank you so much for coming, I'm Shiraishi.

70
00:05:06,818 --> 00:05:08,718
We've heard a lot about you.

71
00:05:08,718 --> 00:05:10,518
"Fumiko Shiraishi (27)" -I'm Fumiko.

72
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,518
This is my daughter, Ran.

73
00:05:12,518 --> 00:05:14,018
And he's a freeloader...

74
00:05:14,018 --> 00:05:16,018
Oh, come on, Dad.

75
00:05:16,018 --> 00:05:18,218
-He's Conan. -Hello.

76
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:23,218
I guess a sake brewery is no fun for you, is it, sonny?

77
00:05:23,218 --> 00:05:25,718
That's not true, right?

78
00:05:25,718 --> 00:05:27,518
I like it very much.

79
00:05:28,518 --> 00:05:30,518
That is Takayama.

80
00:05:32,418 --> 00:05:35,318
I see, that's where you got the name of your brewery from.

81
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:37,818
Please come this way to the office.

82
00:05:39,218 --> 00:05:40,818
Do come along.

83
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:42,118
Thank you.

84
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:46,518
If you will excuse me...

85
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:53,018
How do you like the Takakuma?

86
00:05:55,418 --> 00:05:59,618
It's delicious. There's no other word for it.

87
00:05:59,618 --> 00:06:00,818
It's only sake.

88
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,518
No, no, this is the gem of all sake.

89
00:06:03,518 --> 00:06:04,718
It's splendid.

90
00:06:04,718 --> 00:06:09,918
But, it is our pride and joy to make that "mere sake."

91
00:06:12,818 --> 00:06:14,318
Preparation for making sake

92
00:06:14,318 --> 00:06:17,518
starts with steaming the washed grains of rice.

93
00:06:17,518 --> 00:06:19,318
Rice malt is then mixed in.

94
00:06:21,118 --> 00:06:24,218
The rice malt mixture that is completed is put into a vase,

95
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,718
then water and yeast is added, and let stand to ferment.

96
00:06:27,818 --> 00:06:30,218
Add steamed Statsuma potatoes into the mixture

97
00:06:30,218 --> 00:06:32,518
and ferment even more.

98
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:35,218
The temperature must be kept stable

99
00:06:35,218 --> 00:06:37,318
and the contents must be stirred constantly with a stick

100
00:06:37,318 --> 00:06:40,118
to prevent the propagation of unwanted bacteria.

101
00:06:40,118 --> 00:06:41,518
Then, it is left to mature,

102
00:06:41,518 --> 00:06:45,018
which after, an appropriate amount of water is added,

103
00:06:46,318 --> 00:06:48,118
and the process is finally complete.

104
00:06:48,118 --> 00:06:51,018
There are companies that are mass producing using machines,

105
00:06:51,018 --> 00:06:53,618
but as for us, we have stuck to hand-making the sake.

106
00:06:54,718 --> 00:06:56,818
Limited production,

107
00:06:56,818 --> 00:06:59,018
may sound of the quite nice.

108
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:02,218
But the thing is we can't make more than we are now

109
00:07:02,218 --> 00:07:03,918
if we insist on making something genuine.

110
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:06,618
Right. The genuine made by hand.

111
00:07:06,618 --> 00:07:08,218
It's no wonder it's delicious.

112
00:07:10,418 --> 00:07:11,618
Yes?

113
00:07:11,618 --> 00:07:13,618
I'm Maezono from Weekly Entertainment

114
00:07:13,618 --> 00:07:16,118
that asked for an interview the other day.

115
00:07:16,118 --> 00:07:17,218
Interview?

116
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:19,518
No, I know nothing about it.

117
00:07:19,518 --> 00:07:21,518
"Hitomi Maezono (25)" -I talked to a clerk

118
00:07:21,518 --> 00:07:23,018
"Journalist" -called Mr. Tatsumura.

119
00:07:27,118 --> 00:07:30,618
What's the change over the moment the name Tatsumura was mentioned?

120
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:35,418
I came here to film the preparation process.

121
00:07:35,418 --> 00:07:36,518
The preparation process?

122
00:07:36,518 --> 00:07:39,118
Did Mr. Tatsumura give you permission to do that?

123
00:07:39,118 --> 00:07:41,918
"Seiichi Orita, Daisuke Kosugi" -Just what the heck is on his mind?

124
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:44,318
How can he make such a stupid promise on his own.

125
00:07:44,318 --> 00:07:48,218
I'm sorry to say that we cannot show anyone the preparation process.

126
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,618
You can't? But...

127
00:07:50,618 --> 00:07:53,218
The greatest enemy for the sake making process

128
00:07:53,218 --> 00:07:55,418
is bacterial contamination from outside.

129
00:07:55,418 --> 00:07:57,718
So, no one other than the one who makes the sake

130
00:07:57,718 --> 00:07:59,618
is allowed inside during the process.

131
00:08:00,618 --> 00:08:01,918
I guess so.

132
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:04,618
It's true that people are carriers of various bacteria.

133
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,618
That's common sense.

134
00:08:06,618 --> 00:08:12,318
I'm sorry, I took on the interview because I love distilled spirits,

135
00:08:12,318 --> 00:08:14,618
but how ignorant of me.

136
00:08:14,618 --> 00:08:16,618
We're not angry at you.

137
00:08:16,618 --> 00:08:19,318
We're pissed at Manager Tatsumura.

138
00:08:19,318 --> 00:08:22,918
Hey, what's all the shouting about, Kosugi.

139
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:24,418
-Mr. Tatsumura. -Mr. Tatsumura.

140
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:26,518
"Shinsuke Tatsumura (45)" -Well, well, it sure looks like

141
00:08:26,518 --> 00:08:28,218
"Takakuma Brewey Manager" -I'm not very welcome here?

142
00:08:28,218 --> 00:08:30,418
Are you Ms. Maezono?

143
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:31,418
Yes.

144
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:34,018
I'm so sorry that I'm late.

145
00:08:34,018 --> 00:08:40,118
You see, the physical exam took longer than I expected...

146
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:42,918
I'm sure you're surprised at how small our brewery is.

147
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:44,518
Oh, sort of...

148
00:08:44,518 --> 00:08:47,118
But, we're thinking of re-building it,

149
00:08:47,118 --> 00:08:51,918
so that we can mechanize everything in order to mass produce.

150
00:08:51,918 --> 00:08:53,418
You mean, Takakuma?

151
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:56,018
Mass produce...

152
00:08:56,018 --> 00:08:58,518
Mr. Tatsumura, I've told you time and again

153
00:08:58,518 --> 00:09:00,118
that we're not thinking of doing something like that.

154
00:09:00,118 --> 00:09:03,518
Mass production will surely bring down the quality of its taste.

155
00:09:03,518 --> 00:09:06,418
As you can see, we've got a stubborn president.

156
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:08,018
Distilled spirits is the "in" thing now.

157
00:09:08,018 --> 00:09:11,018
If we don't mass produce now and make big cash, what's in it for us.

158
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:15,518
I think it's not a very good idea to mass produce.

159
00:09:17,518 --> 00:09:21,518
I'll think about whether I really want to interview this situation.

160
00:09:21,518 --> 00:09:23,418
Goodbye.

161
00:09:23,418 --> 00:09:25,518
Wait, I figured it would have advertising benefits

162
00:09:25,518 --> 00:09:27,818
and I was counting on it too.

163
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:31,518
Why don't you try to love the liquor of your brewery a little more?

164
00:09:31,518 --> 00:09:32,518
You're not even thinking

165
00:09:32,518 --> 00:09:34,918
about possibility of the taste of Takakuma being spoiled.

166
00:09:34,918 --> 00:09:36,618
I can't allow that!

167
00:09:39,318 --> 00:09:41,718
Okay, shall we all go back to work too, then.

168
00:09:41,718 --> 00:09:44,918
Even if it's not brought in from the outside,

169
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,718
unwanted bacteria is already inside from some time in the past.

170
00:09:46,718 --> 00:09:49,318
Unwanted bacteria, talking about me.

171
00:09:49,318 --> 00:09:51,418
I tell you, you're all the same.

172
00:09:51,418 --> 00:09:55,918
I'm against mechanizing the making of hand-made sake too.

173
00:09:55,918 --> 00:09:57,018
Who are you?

174
00:09:57,018 --> 00:10:00,418
Thank you for everything today.

175
00:10:04,718 --> 00:10:07,418
Wait up, if I remember correctly...

176
00:10:07,418 --> 00:10:11,318
That's right! You're the renown detective, Kogoro Mouri!

177
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:13,818
You're just the guy.

178
00:10:13,818 --> 00:10:15,618
Wait, please wait!

179
00:10:15,618 --> 00:10:19,518
An image character to advertise the product?

180
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,418
I was looking for someone

181
00:10:21,418 --> 00:10:24,418
who would match the image of our product.

182
00:10:24,418 --> 00:10:26,618
If you agree to accept to do it,

183
00:10:26,618 --> 00:10:29,418
I'll send you as much sake as you want.

184
00:10:29,418 --> 00:10:30,818
You mean that Takakuma?

185
00:10:30,818 --> 00:10:32,818
Dad, don't tell me that you're going to?

186
00:10:32,818 --> 00:10:35,718
Well, but, you see...

187
00:10:36,718 --> 00:10:39,918
When it comes to sake, he's got super weak will power.

188
00:10:39,918 --> 00:10:43,418
That's right, I'll take you around tomorrow.

189
00:10:43,418 --> 00:10:44,918
It's my day off,

190
00:10:44,918 --> 00:10:46,918
so I'll treat you to some place good to eat.

191
00:10:46,918 --> 00:10:50,418
Please do accept my offer, okay, okay?

192
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:55,418
Mr. Mouri, let me do that for you.

193
00:10:55,418 --> 00:10:56,718
Mrs. Shiraishi.

194
00:10:56,718 --> 00:11:00,318
It's a token of my gratitude for you liking our sake so much.

195
00:11:00,318 --> 00:11:02,618
Please let me take you around.

196
00:11:03,918 --> 00:11:06,818
Well, I guess a woman guide is more enjoyable.

197
00:11:06,818 --> 00:11:09,418
I guess I'll leave it up to Mrs. Shiraishi then,

198
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,618
and relax as I was planning to anyway.

199
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:15,518
Mr. Mouri, I'll be waiting for a good answer.

200
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,818
Dad!

201
00:11:26,818 --> 00:11:29,418
Why didn't you refuse him flatly?

202
00:11:31,318 --> 00:11:34,318
It's Takamori Saigo, awesome!

203
00:11:35,318 --> 00:11:37,418
Goodness, you always avoid things you can't handle.

204
00:11:37,418 --> 00:11:42,018
But for some reason I don't like that man called Mr. Tatsumura.

205
00:11:42,018 --> 00:11:44,618
The others don't seem to like him much either.

206
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:48,718
It is more than that.

207
00:11:48,718 --> 00:11:50,818
He utterly despised.

208
00:11:50,818 --> 00:11:55,218
But why do Mr. and Mrs. Shirashi keep him as a staff?

209
00:12:02,048 --> 00:12:03,848
"Shiroyama Grand Hotel"

210
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,548
The winds on Sakurajima are blowing quite strongly today.

211
00:12:06,548 --> 00:12:11,048
They even forecast the direction of the wind in Kagoshima.

212
00:12:11,048 --> 00:12:13,448
Oh, yeah.

213
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:15,748
I wonder for what, though?

214
00:12:15,748 --> 00:12:17,048
Because ashes come falling.

215
00:12:18,148 --> 00:12:21,248
-Good morning. -Good morning.

216
00:12:22,548 --> 00:12:25,248
The ashes of Sakurajima ride the wind and fly,

217
00:12:25,248 --> 00:12:27,248
so hanging the laundry out when the wind is blowing

218
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:28,548
would be a disaster, right?

219
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,248
So that's why the direction of the wind is a problem.

220
00:12:32,248 --> 00:12:34,048
I wonder if ashes will come flying today too?

221
00:12:35,048 --> 00:12:36,748
Nobody knows,

222
00:12:36,748 --> 00:12:38,448
because the wind's capricious.

223
00:12:38,448 --> 00:12:41,948
Wow, how'd they write it?

224
00:12:43,748 --> 00:12:45,748
-Mrs. Shiraishi? -Yes?

225
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:50,348
How come the man called Mr. Tatsumura doesn't get fired?

226
00:12:50,348 --> 00:12:53,148
What the heck's the matter with you, brat?

227
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:54,448
Conan!

228
00:12:54,448 --> 00:12:56,848
I'm sorry.

229
00:12:56,848 --> 00:13:00,148
I guess even a child would think there's something strange about it.

230
00:13:00,148 --> 00:13:03,148
But, we can't fire him

231
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:04,948
because we owe a lot to him from the past.

232
00:13:04,948 --> 00:13:06,748
Owe a lot to him from the past?

233
00:13:08,748 --> 00:13:11,548
Our brewery has a history.

234
00:13:11,548 --> 00:13:14,948
But, we're a small brewery without a name to begin with,

235
00:13:14,948 --> 00:13:17,948
so our product didn't sell too well...

236
00:13:17,948 --> 00:13:22,348
If things were left as is, we would've been out of business long ago.

237
00:13:22,348 --> 00:13:23,848
We somehow made it to where we are now,

238
00:13:23,848 --> 00:13:27,348
thanks to Mr. Tatsumura who is in charge of sales

239
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,048
going all out selling our products.

240
00:13:33,448 --> 00:13:35,848
Still, we are unable to face up

241
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,448
to the major manufacturer's production ability

242
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:39,348
of low profit high sales way of business.

243
00:13:39,348 --> 00:13:43,948
We were finally faced with going out of business 10 years ago,

244
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,248
that was 5 years before I got married.

245
00:13:47,248 --> 00:13:49,948
Back then, my father-in-law, the predecessor, and my husband,

246
00:13:49,948 --> 00:13:54,948
who was still an apprentice, came to a decision...

247
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:58,048
If this was to be it,

248
00:13:58,048 --> 00:13:59,948
they decided to do as they really wished to do.

249
00:13:59,948 --> 00:14:01,548
And that was to be really particular about the ingredients

250
00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:03,248
and the method the sake is made.

251
00:14:03,248 --> 00:14:05,248
They decided to close the Takakuma Brewery

252
00:14:05,248 --> 00:14:08,148
only after they made the best liquor they could ever make.

253
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:10,148
And that's the Takakuma.

254
00:14:10,148 --> 00:14:11,648
Yes. And,

255
00:14:11,648 --> 00:14:13,748
it was recognized as "genuine".

256
00:14:13,748 --> 00:14:16,848
Everybody's waiting for the real thing.

257
00:14:16,848 --> 00:14:18,348
But, in winter of last year,

258
00:14:18,348 --> 00:14:19,948
because of his long years of strain from worry,

259
00:14:19,948 --> 00:14:21,148
the predecessor passed away...

260
00:14:21,148 --> 00:14:25,848
Don't you forget what we decided on 10 years ago.

261
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:26,848
Yes, sir!

262
00:14:26,848 --> 00:14:30,748
That's about when a change came about Mr. Tatsumura.

263
00:14:30,748 --> 00:14:33,148
What? Mass production?

264
00:14:33,148 --> 00:14:36,448
Customer's come asking for the brand name Takakuma.

265
00:14:36,448 --> 00:14:39,548
They wouldn't know the difference if the quality of taste drops a little.

266
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:41,748
Business! Business!

267
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,148
What a thing to say.

268
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:45,848
Are you going to allow him to talk like that, president?

269
00:14:45,848 --> 00:14:47,448
He's going to spoil our liquor.

270
00:14:47,448 --> 00:14:49,048
We'd better drive him out of here.

271
00:14:49,048 --> 00:14:50,648
Dear.

272
00:14:50,648 --> 00:14:55,648
I can't. We were rescued from going out of business thanks to him.

273
00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:58,648
We're obliged to him and I will never forget that.

274
00:15:00,048 --> 00:15:01,548
You sure are stubborn.

275
00:15:01,548 --> 00:15:04,748
My husband is not really all that good at getting ahead.

276
00:15:04,748 --> 00:15:06,548
He never forgets what someone has done for him.

277
00:15:06,548 --> 00:15:08,148
He sure is a man of Statsuma.

278
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:09,648
He's fantastic.

279
00:15:10,748 --> 00:15:15,748
Mr. Mouri, please refuse what Mr. Tatsuma asked you to do yesterday.

280
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,848
If a famous person like you, Mr. Mouri

281
00:15:17,848 --> 00:15:22,448
cooperates with advertising the product, he can't lose.

282
00:15:22,448 --> 00:15:24,848
I'm sure that he will force his way through

283
00:15:24,848 --> 00:15:27,448
to mechanizing the process and start mass production.

284
00:15:27,448 --> 00:15:29,148
I see.

285
00:15:29,148 --> 00:15:32,048
You decided to take over showing me around

286
00:15:32,048 --> 00:15:34,848
to ask me not to listen to him.

287
00:15:34,848 --> 00:15:36,248
I'm sorry.

288
00:15:36,248 --> 00:15:39,148
Well, I was planning to refuse anyway!

289
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:41,448
Of course, from the very start...

290
00:15:41,448 --> 00:15:43,148
Isn't it?

291
00:15:50,048 --> 00:15:54,148
Mr. Tatsumura lives in Kagoshima city.

292
00:15:54,148 --> 00:15:56,248
I'm glad, he seems to be home.

293
00:15:59,748 --> 00:16:01,548
6:00 pm.

294
00:16:01,548 --> 00:16:03,548
Does Mr. Tatsumura have a family?

295
00:16:03,548 --> 00:16:06,548
No, he lives alone.

296
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:10,148
It's open.

297
00:16:11,348 --> 00:16:13,648
I'll go check inside.

298
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:16,348
Mr. Tatsumura, this is Fumiko.

299
00:16:17,448 --> 00:16:20,648
Doesn't something feel sandy?

300
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:22,548
Now that you mentioned it...

301
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:25,048
It's probably the ashes.

302
00:16:26,048 --> 00:16:28,448
Oh no.

303
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,248
His car's not here.

304
00:16:33,348 --> 00:16:34,648
Mrs. Shiraishi!

305
00:16:36,148 --> 00:16:37,248
What's the matter?

306
00:16:41,648 --> 00:16:42,748
This is...

307
00:16:48,348 --> 00:16:49,448
It's blood.

308
00:16:49,448 --> 00:16:52,248
Don't tell me it's... Mr. Tatsumura's?

309
00:17:00,848 --> 00:17:03,748
I can imagine just about what happened.

310
00:17:03,748 --> 00:17:07,548
When Mr. Tatsumura was relaxing on his day off...

311
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:18,748
Judging from the circumstances,

312
00:17:18,748 --> 00:17:21,048
this is a case of kidnapping.

313
00:17:22,348 --> 00:17:25,048
And, when you all came here,

314
00:17:25,048 --> 00:17:27,848
the fact that the lights were on

315
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:31,348
means that he was taken away some time after sundown.

316
00:17:31,348 --> 00:17:33,648
I can give a more exact time.

317
00:17:33,648 --> 00:17:38,048
When I confirmed the time, the blood stain wasn't dry yet.

318
00:17:38,048 --> 00:17:39,348
That means the time of the murder

319
00:17:39,348 --> 00:17:42,648
was right before 6:00 when we found him.

320
00:17:42,648 --> 00:17:46,348
I see, Ohatakeyama, pursue the car on the double.

321
00:17:46,348 --> 00:17:47,348
Yes, sir!

322
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:54,748
Weren't you a nurse at the Chuo Hospital before?

323
00:17:54,748 --> 00:17:57,748
Yes. I was, until 5 years ago when I got married.

324
00:18:00,048 --> 00:18:03,048
So you are the nurse I saw back then.

325
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:05,048
-Hurry up and get going! -Yes, sir!

326
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:06,948
"Shiroyama Grand Hotel"

327
00:18:09,248 --> 00:18:12,848
I'm sorry I got you messed up in something bothersome.

328
00:18:15,848 --> 00:18:17,648
You must be worried.

329
00:18:17,648 --> 00:18:19,648
He may have been a bit of trouble,

330
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:22,348
but after all Mr. Tatsumura did help you out so...

331
00:18:22,348 --> 00:18:23,748
If the kidnapper is after money,

332
00:18:23,748 --> 00:18:26,248
he'll surely call to demand ransom.

333
00:18:26,248 --> 00:18:28,348
When he does, we'll nail him...

334
00:18:29,548 --> 00:18:33,848
However, there was no contact from the kidnapper the following day.

335
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:39,148
I wonder why the kidnapper's not making contact?

336
00:18:39,148 --> 00:18:42,148
And, another day went by...

337
00:18:42,148 --> 00:18:45,048
The prefectural police received an anonymous call,

338
00:18:45,048 --> 00:18:49,048
saying that Mr. Tatsumura, would be found at Terayama Park in the city.

339
00:18:55,948 --> 00:18:57,348
Mr. Tatsumura!

340
00:18:57,348 --> 00:19:01,948
This is not a place where people would normally set foot in.

341
00:19:01,948 --> 00:19:04,648
The caller was probably the killer.

342
00:19:04,648 --> 00:19:05,948
The voice seems to have been a made-up voice,

343
00:19:05,948 --> 00:19:07,748
in which you could not make out the gender.

344
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:10,948
Kidnap and murder... what a guy.

345
00:19:12,248 --> 00:19:13,848
Dead for two days?

346
00:19:13,848 --> 00:19:16,048
Yes, according to the result of the autopsy,

347
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:19,648
he was killed two days ago, that is on that day.

348
00:19:19,648 --> 00:19:21,248
Two days having past,

349
00:19:21,248 --> 00:19:24,748
it's hard to determine an accurate estimate,

350
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:26,148
but there seems to be no doubt that the time of death

351
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:29,048
is between sundown to night that day.

352
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:31,648
The cause of his death was from a blow to the back of his head

353
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:34,448
and he seems to have died instantly with one blow.

354
00:19:35,448 --> 00:19:37,148
What?

355
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:39,948
The figurine that was on the floor of the living room,

356
00:19:39,948 --> 00:19:43,448
the traces on the figurine and his head matched perfectly

357
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,348
and the blood stains that were found

358
00:19:45,348 --> 00:19:50,348
were Mr. Tatsumura's so it's no doubt that it is the murder weapon.

359
00:19:50,348 --> 00:19:51,848
Wait a minute.

360
00:19:51,848 --> 00:19:53,848
If Mr. Tatsumura died instantly with one blow to his head,

361
00:19:53,848 --> 00:19:55,948
it means that the killer didn't strike him

362
00:19:55,948 --> 00:19:58,448
and pass him out,

363
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,348
then take him away but...

364
00:20:00,348 --> 00:20:02,048
killed him on the spot, took him away

365
00:20:02,048 --> 00:20:04,948
and abandoned his car at the park, dead body and all.

366
00:20:07,148 --> 00:20:09,848
Then, two days later today, the killer,

367
00:20:09,848 --> 00:20:11,548
calls from his side to notify the police of Mr. Tatsumura's whereabouts.

368
00:20:11,548 --> 00:20:13,348
That's the story.

369
00:20:13,348 --> 00:20:15,148
There must be some reason why the killer

370
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:18,448
went out of the way to carry Mr. Tatsumura out of the house.

371
00:20:18,448 --> 00:20:21,248
Moreover, the killer notified the police of Mr. Tatsumura's whereabouts.

372
00:20:21,248 --> 00:20:23,448
But, why?

373
00:20:23,448 --> 00:20:26,248
And, according the report by the forensic officers,

374
00:20:26,248 --> 00:20:29,048
all the doors and windows of Mr. Tatsumura's house

375
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:32,048
had no traces of being forced opened.

376
00:20:33,348 --> 00:20:35,548
Besides, the locks to his house were all special types

377
00:20:35,548 --> 00:20:38,048
that spare keys could not be made.

378
00:20:38,048 --> 00:20:41,548
If so, how did the killer make it into the house?

379
00:20:41,548 --> 00:20:43,548
There is only one way.

380
00:20:45,548 --> 00:20:48,048
That is, the killer and Mr. Tatsumura knew each other.

381
00:20:50,648 --> 00:20:51,648
As to this case,

382
00:20:51,648 --> 00:20:55,348
no cash had been stolen, so it is not a case of robbery.

383
00:20:55,348 --> 00:20:57,648
The only thing thinkable is a grudge.

384
00:20:57,648 --> 00:21:00,448
Somebody hated him enough to want to kill him.

385
00:21:00,448 --> 00:21:02,748
And, moreover, it was someone who was around him.

386
00:21:02,748 --> 00:21:04,048
Which means...

387
00:21:06,648 --> 00:21:09,348
What? The killer is among us?

388
00:21:11,648 --> 00:21:15,748
We can't find anybody who had a grudge against Mr. Tatsumura

389
00:21:15,748 --> 00:21:18,648
other than the people of this brewery.

390
00:21:18,648 --> 00:21:21,848
Then, why do I have to be suspected too?

391
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:24,448
We know that you held ill feelings against Mr. Tatsumura

392
00:21:24,448 --> 00:21:26,348
from the information we got asking around.

393
00:21:26,348 --> 00:21:27,848
No.

394
00:21:27,848 --> 00:21:32,848
Of course we had a grudge against him. We all did, but...

395
00:21:32,848 --> 00:21:36,248
He was killed at sundown the day before yesterday, right?

396
00:21:36,248 --> 00:21:40,548
Then, all of us here were in the brewery working.

397
00:21:42,248 --> 00:21:44,548
I thought I already told you

398
00:21:44,548 --> 00:21:45,948
that everyone was working and...

399
00:21:47,048 --> 00:21:51,548
It could be that you're all matching your story up together too.

400
00:21:53,248 --> 00:21:55,048
And, Ms. Maezono,

401
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:57,748
since you say that you were in your hotel room alone,

402
00:21:57,748 --> 00:21:59,748
your alibi hasn't been backed up yet.

403
00:22:01,648 --> 00:22:03,948
We don't want to suspect any of you,

404
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:07,548
but what Officer Shinfuku is saying abides to logical reasoning.

405
00:22:07,548 --> 00:22:08,748
Dad!

406
00:22:08,748 --> 00:22:12,848
It's true that no one here has a definite alibi.

407
00:22:12,848 --> 00:22:16,348
And, everyone hates Mr. Tatsumura.

408
00:22:17,448 --> 00:22:19,548
I'll bet Mrs. Shiraishi is in agony,

409
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:22,348
being that everyone close to her is being suspected.

410
00:22:25,748 --> 00:22:27,848
But...

411
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:32,348
I'm sure the killer is among the people here.

412
00:24:32,075 --> 00:24:33,975
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:33,975 --> 00:24:36,275
"Physical examination"

414
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:38,475
In the next episode, the case in Kagoshima is solved.

415
00:24:38,475 --> 00:24:40,975
-Can I still drink? -Dad!
