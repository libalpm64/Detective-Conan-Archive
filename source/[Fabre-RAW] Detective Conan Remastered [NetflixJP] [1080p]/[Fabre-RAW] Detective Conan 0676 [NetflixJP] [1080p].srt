1
00:00:02,538 --> 00:00:03,983
We, the members of the Youth Detective Squad

2
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:05,538
along with Agasa are invited over

3
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:09,138
to the house of a couple we met at a camp site to have barbecue.

4
00:00:10,438 --> 00:00:12,738
The couple welcomes us when we get to their home,

5
00:00:12,738 --> 00:00:15,238
and we all have barbecue together.

6
00:00:15,238 --> 00:00:17,638
The couple goes back into the house

7
00:00:17,638 --> 00:00:20,338
saying that the husband's cell phone is nowhere in sight.

8
00:00:20,338 --> 00:00:24,003
The cell phone is found under the bench in the yard.

9
00:00:24,238 --> 00:00:26,005
When Ayumi goes to deliver the cell phone...

10
00:00:30,738 --> 00:00:34,538
I'm not forgiving you anymore!

11
00:00:34,538 --> 00:00:36,015
I'm gonna kill you!

12
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:38,738
Hey, Sumika!

13
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:40,438
Cool it.

14
00:00:40,438 --> 00:00:42,438
Sumika.

15
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:48,038
Die!

16
00:00:50,338 --> 00:00:52,738
Bad... bad news!

17
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:55,438
Those two are at it again!

18
00:00:55,438 --> 00:00:58,438
I tell you. Not again. Let them be.

19
00:00:58,438 --> 00:01:01,138
But the wife is holding a knife saying,

20
00:01:01,138 --> 00:01:02,438
she's going to kill him.

21
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:04,043
-What? -What?

22
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:06,038
We've got to stop them, quick!

23
00:01:18,738 --> 00:01:21,638
At first glance, it looked to be that the husband

24
00:01:21,638 --> 00:01:26,065
accidentally stabbed his wife after they had an argument, but...

25
00:01:26,238 --> 00:01:29,438
But, if that lady makes it,

26
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:32,538
it's probably thanks to us who came here, right?

27
00:01:32,538 --> 00:01:35,538
Yes, I guess so.

28
00:01:35,538 --> 00:01:37,238
If back then, the cell phone wasn't found

29
00:01:37,238 --> 00:01:40,079
and Ayumi didn't go to give it to him,

30
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,081
we wouldn't have realized that the two were fighting

31
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:44,838
and maybe it would've been too late to save her.

32
00:01:46,538 --> 00:01:49,738
Something just doesn't seem right.

33
00:01:49,738 --> 00:01:52,091
Everything's moving too smoothly.

34
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:55,338
Like something's being manipulated.

35
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:01,138
Oh, mail.

36
00:02:01,138 --> 00:02:04,738
That's Mrs. Konno's cell phone that we found a while ago, right?

37
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:07,438
-Yep. -Let me see it.

38
00:02:10,438 --> 00:02:14,113
No, you shouldn't read other people's mail without permission.

39
00:02:14,113 --> 00:02:16,115
This is...

40
00:02:16,338 --> 00:02:18,117
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

41
00:02:18,117 --> 00:02:21,638
The husband was saying that his wife sent mails saying, "Die, thief"

42
00:02:21,638 --> 00:02:25,138
to the women that sent him suspicious mails, right?

43
00:02:25,138 --> 00:02:28,538
Yes, but there's nothing like that here.

44
00:02:28,538 --> 00:02:30,538
It does seem that she was irritated

45
00:02:30,538 --> 00:02:33,038
because she wasn't feeling good, though.

46
00:02:33,038 --> 00:02:37,238
I see! That's why that cup was over there!

47
00:02:37,238 --> 00:02:40,638
She wasn't feeling good, that is, she was feeling sick, right?

48
00:02:40,638 --> 00:02:44,143
It looked like the lady was about to drink medicine.

49
00:02:44,143 --> 00:02:48,147
Because I found a glass cup with water inside in the kitchen!

50
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:50,638
Glass cup with water?

51
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:53,338
Then, did you find medicine nearby too?

52
00:02:53,338 --> 00:02:57,438
No. The only other thing there was a sugar container.

53
00:02:57,438 --> 00:03:02,738
I was about to bring that water to the lady, but...

54
00:03:05,338 --> 00:03:08,438
Are you all right, Genta?

55
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,038
Maybe you're the one who needs medicine, Genta.

56
00:03:11,038 --> 00:03:13,438
Could it be that you have a cold?

57
00:03:14,538 --> 00:03:18,638
No. My nose feels ticklish.

58
00:03:18,638 --> 00:03:21,038
I can't stop...

59
00:03:21,038 --> 00:03:24,738
Then, why don't you try holding the space below your nose

60
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,938
with your index finger and blocking off your nostrils?

61
00:03:26,938 --> 00:03:28,838
Like this?

62
00:03:28,838 --> 00:03:32,638
If that doesn't work, pinch your nose.

63
00:03:32,638 --> 00:03:33,938
It stopped!

64
00:03:33,938 --> 00:03:37,238
Well, it's something like a lucky spell.

65
00:03:37,238 --> 00:03:39,238
Lucky spell...

66
00:03:40,538 --> 00:03:42,201
Don't tell me it's...

67
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:48,538
Don't tell me that he used it and attacked his wife.

68
00:03:51,938 --> 00:03:53,738
The vivid colored memories of summer

69
00:03:53,738 --> 00:03:55,938
solve mysteries all season round.

70
00:03:55,938 --> 00:03:57,838
A couple's brawl is the cause of the case?

71
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,238
The feelings of the two that have gone astray.

72
00:04:00,238 --> 00:04:01,838
He sees through the one and only truth.

73
00:04:01,838 --> 00:04:03,938
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

74
00:04:03,938 --> 00:04:06,238
His name is Detective Conan!

75
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:52,981
"Not Even a Millimeter of Forgiveness (Part 2)"

76
00:05:53,781 --> 00:05:55,681
Lucky spell...

77
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,337
Don't tell me that...

78
00:06:00,881 --> 00:06:05,481
Don't tell me that he used it and attacked his wife.

79
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:10,981
But there's no proof at all to prove that for now.

80
00:06:10,981 --> 00:06:14,353
The only thing we have to go on is his wife's testimony.

81
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:15,981
Hey.

82
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:18,357
Something's shining.

83
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:19,381
What?

84
00:06:19,381 --> 00:06:22,081
I just happened to take a video

85
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:25,881
of when Ayumi went to deliver the cell phone, you see.

86
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:27,181
Bad news!

87
00:06:27,181 --> 00:06:29,881
Those two are at it again!

88
00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:32,681
I tell you. Not again. Let them be.

89
00:06:32,681 --> 00:06:33,781
It's after this.

90
00:06:33,781 --> 00:06:36,381
But the wife is holding a knife saying,

91
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:38,081
she's going to kill him.

92
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:40,381
Here.

93
00:06:40,381 --> 00:06:44,383
The lamp on Ayumi's cell phone is on, see?

94
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:46,981
Yeah.

95
00:06:46,981 --> 00:06:50,081
Maybe it's the telephone answering service?

96
00:06:50,081 --> 00:06:54,393
He said that he called his wife from this cell phone,

97
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:56,395
so it just may be here.

98
00:06:56,581 --> 00:06:59,081
The little clue that may serve as a lead

99
00:06:59,081 --> 00:07:00,681
to the trick of Mrs. Konno being stabbed.

100
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:03,881
This is the answering service.

101
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,405
There is one new message for you.

102
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:10,881
I'm not forgiving you anymore!

103
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:12,781
I'm gonna kill you!

104
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:14,413
Hey, Sumika.

105
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:16,081
Cool it.

106
00:07:16,081 --> 00:07:17,081
Sumika.

107
00:07:17,081 --> 00:07:19,181
Die!

108
00:07:21,581 --> 00:07:23,481
Did it stop?

109
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:26,425
To listen to this message again...

110
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:29,081
What does that last phrase mean?

111
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,081
It was Mrs. Konno's voice, wasn't it?

112
00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:34,781
If I'm not mistaken, she said "Did it stop", didn't she?

113
00:07:34,781 --> 00:07:36,881
Just as I thought.

114
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:39,981
This is not self-defense.

115
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:41,881
He took advantage of his wife's personality,

116
00:07:41,881 --> 00:07:44,181
and tried to kill her.

117
00:07:44,181 --> 00:07:45,681
Unaware at all that doing so,

118
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:48,881
would result in a situation so disastrous.

119
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:02,181
"Surgery in progress"

120
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:10,181
"Surgery in progress"

121
00:08:11,181 --> 00:08:12,481
The lamp turned off!

122
00:08:12,481 --> 00:08:14,981
It seems the surgery has finished!

123
00:08:18,781 --> 00:08:20,479
Sumika!

124
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:25,081
And, how did the surgery go?

125
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:26,485
Just fine!

126
00:08:26,681 --> 00:08:29,481
The pulmonary artery was a bit damaged,

127
00:08:29,481 --> 00:08:32,181
but since the treatment right after she was stabbed was appropriate,

128
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:33,781
it saved her life.

129
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:36,281
She should be discharged in a few weeks.

130
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:38,981
-All right! -All right!

131
00:08:38,981 --> 00:08:41,781
-Thank you very much. -Not at all.

132
00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:43,481
Thank you very much.

133
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:48,507
I've already reported to the police

134
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:50,981
that this was an accident as a result of a brawl.

135
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:52,260
I understand.

136
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:57,981
Please tell the officers that will be here in a while the details, too.

137
00:08:57,981 --> 00:09:01,081
Although it's an accident, no doubt it's a serious incident, you see.

138
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:02,981
I know.

139
00:09:02,981 --> 00:09:04,523
Well, after she recovers,

140
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:07,381
I'm sure your wife will be questioned too.

141
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,081
At any rate, please watch yourselves when fighting with each other.

142
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:12,531
Yes. Thank you very much.

143
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:14,281
Take care.

144
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:22,281
Relief, guilt and fear.

145
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:26,281
If so, the next action that'll be taken is...

146
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:31,181
To spit it all out to the police

147
00:09:31,181 --> 00:09:34,553
or flee from here.

148
00:09:34,553 --> 00:09:36,281
Or...

149
00:09:38,781 --> 00:09:39,881
What?

150
00:09:39,881 --> 00:09:43,381
You were at the site where the wife was stabbed, too?

151
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:46,565
Yeah, although we didn't see her get stabbed.

152
00:09:46,781 --> 00:09:49,481
Ayumi saw her before she got stabbed though.

153
00:09:49,481 --> 00:09:50,581
Yep.

154
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:53,681
Because I found the cell phone that Mr. Konno was looking for,

155
00:09:53,681 --> 00:09:56,181
and went to deliver it to where they both were.

156
00:09:56,181 --> 00:09:58,981
Then I saw Mrs. Konno was holding a knife...

157
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:01,981
I'm not forgiving you anymore!

158
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:04,381
I'm gonna kill you!

159
00:10:04,381 --> 00:10:05,581
I see.

160
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:07,881
After hearing about it from Ayumi,

161
00:10:07,881 --> 00:10:10,181
we rushed over to see Mrs. Konno

162
00:10:10,181 --> 00:10:14,281
lying on the floor with a knife stabbed into her!

163
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,595
I see, I see.

164
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:18,381
I guess the husband stabbed her

165
00:10:18,381 --> 00:10:20,599
while they were fighting with each other.

166
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:23,681
And where's her husband now?

167
00:10:23,681 --> 00:10:27,381
Huh? He was here till just a while ago.

168
00:10:27,381 --> 00:10:31,081
Come to think of it, Conan and Ai aren't here either.

169
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:33,581
True. I wonder where they went?

170
00:10:33,581 --> 00:10:36,181
Maybe to the restroom or something?

171
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:42,621
"Beika General Hospital"

172
00:10:55,808 --> 00:10:57,808
Are you going to run for it?

173
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:02,208
After doing what you did to your wife,

174
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:05,608
I'm asking you if you alone plan to cross over!

175
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,508
Just what're you talking about?

176
00:11:09,508 --> 00:11:13,408
I just came out to this roof to get some fresh air,

177
00:11:13,408 --> 00:11:17,608
relieved that my wife was saved.

178
00:11:17,608 --> 00:11:20,008
So, cut out your silly remark

179
00:11:20,008 --> 00:11:21,908
and go back to where everyone else is.

180
00:11:21,908 --> 00:11:26,408
I'll bet you're planning to jump off after we leave, right?

181
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,408
Is it because after your wife recovers

182
00:11:29,408 --> 00:11:31,508
and is interrogated by the police,

183
00:11:31,508 --> 00:11:33,408
the truth will come to light?

184
00:11:33,408 --> 00:11:36,675
The truth that you were planning to kill her to begin with?

185
00:11:38,408 --> 00:11:40,679
See, that look on your face.

186
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:44,683
You had the same look on your face when you heard from the doctor

187
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:48,108
about the police interrogation a while ago.

188
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:51,208
When you heard that your wife was saved,

189
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,008
tears flowed from your eyes,

190
00:11:53,008 --> 00:11:55,108
but you were wearing a look of relief.

191
00:11:55,108 --> 00:11:57,908
When you heard again that your wife was in critical condition,

192
00:11:57,908 --> 00:12:00,108
you looked down and away

193
00:12:00,108 --> 00:12:03,908
because of your feeling of guilt of having done something seriously bad.

194
00:12:03,908 --> 00:12:06,705
After your wife's recovery,

195
00:12:06,908 --> 00:12:09,108
to think that the entire truth would come to light,

196
00:12:09,108 --> 00:12:13,708
you closed your lips tightly and opened your eyes wide,

197
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,708
this was the look of hidden fear.

198
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:19,308
If you unfortunately stabbed your wife in self-defense,

199
00:12:19,308 --> 00:12:21,108
you wouldn't be wearing such a look.

200
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,608
Such a look...

201
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:27,008
Your friend saw it too, right?

202
00:12:27,008 --> 00:12:29,608
My wife flung up the knife to attack me

203
00:12:29,608 --> 00:12:32,508
saying that she was going to kill me!

204
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,208
I had no other choice but to do so,

205
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,408
in order to save myself.

206
00:12:37,408 --> 00:12:39,608
I had no other choice!

207
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:42,741
-Your wife didn't try to kill you. -What?

208
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:45,608
She was just trying to shock you.

209
00:12:45,608 --> 00:12:48,747
Shock me? Why?

210
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:52,008
-Because it didn't stop. -What?

211
00:12:52,008 --> 00:12:55,108
Your hiccups!

212
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:58,208
Hiccups, to stop it?

213
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,208
That's why she flung up the knife,

214
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,708
saying that she was going to kill me?

215
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:08,408
That's ridiculous.

216
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:12,008
You know her well too, don't you, your wife's personality?

217
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:13,708
Last Christmas,

218
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,408
she wore the reindeer outfit because you didn't accept her

219
00:13:16,408 --> 00:13:19,508
wearing the mini skirt Santa outfit.

220
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:22,508
She tried to delight us by welcoming us,

221
00:13:22,508 --> 00:13:26,108
wearing a Halloween outfit, despite it being way past the date.

222
00:13:26,108 --> 00:13:27,308
She's the type that would go all the way

223
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:28,408
without thinking of the consequences

224
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:31,108
if she thinks it'll please someone.

225
00:13:31,108 --> 00:13:32,791
Being the of her nature,

226
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:36,208
if she sees you having trouble because your hiccups wouldn't stop,

227
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,608
it's really easy to assume that she would go all the way,

228
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,408
no matter how distasteful, to shock you,

229
00:13:40,408 --> 00:13:43,408
in order to try to make it stop!

230
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:46,408
If you are hiccupping while trying to place a phone call

231
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,208
to your superior at the company,

232
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,608
and the more so, if she goes into the kitchen

233
00:13:49,608 --> 00:13:53,208
and sees a fruit knife there!

234
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,308
Well, there seems to have been a cup with water in it

235
00:13:56,308 --> 00:13:59,708
and a sugar container in the kitchen,

236
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,608
so your wife seems to have thought of other ways

237
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,823
to stop your hiccups, too.

238
00:14:05,008 --> 00:14:06,508
Sugar?

239
00:14:06,508 --> 00:14:10,208
There's a not too well known method of stopping hiccups

240
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:14,308
by shoving a spoonful of sugar down your throat too, you know.

241
00:14:14,308 --> 00:14:17,408
In Japan, the well known method is

242
00:14:17,408 --> 00:14:20,308
to make a person drink water or shock the person.

243
00:14:20,308 --> 00:14:23,608
In other words, the trick that you set up is as follows.

244
00:14:24,508 --> 00:14:28,208
First, you hinted that your cell phone is nowhere in sight,

245
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:32,108
in front of all of us that you invited over to have barbecue with.

246
00:14:32,108 --> 00:14:34,853
Then you set it up so that your wife gets irritated

247
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:37,508
and that leads to a brawl.

248
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:41,708
Then, in order to make your wife help you look for the cell phone,

249
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,608
you lure her into the living room

250
00:14:43,608 --> 00:14:47,908
and pretend to find your cell phone that you hid under the sofa.

251
00:14:47,908 --> 00:14:49,808
You tell her that you want to make a call to your superior

252
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:52,408
because you didn't receive any mail from him.

253
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:54,608
Which after, you pretended to have the hiccups

254
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:57,408
and set her up.

255
00:14:57,408 --> 00:14:59,708
After telling her that you want to make a call to the Department Head,

256
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,608
but your hiccups won't stop.

257
00:15:02,608 --> 00:15:06,108
Then you confirmed that your wife got hold of the knife

258
00:15:06,108 --> 00:15:07,808
just as you expected,

259
00:15:07,808 --> 00:15:10,408
and rang your wife's cell phone

260
00:15:10,408 --> 00:15:13,408
that you hid under the barbecue bench beforehand.

261
00:15:13,408 --> 00:15:15,708
You wanted anybody among us

262
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,708
who came to deliver the cell phone to the living room,

263
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:22,901
to witness your wife coming at you with a knife.

264
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:24,508
This way, even if it were that you snatched the knife away from her,

265
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:26,408
and stabbed her instead,

266
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:30,208
it would look as if your wife who was irritated at you, tried to kill you,

267
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:34,408
so having no choice, you stabbed her in self-defense!

268
00:15:34,408 --> 00:15:35,808
Well, ironically though,

269
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:39,408
on your wife's cell phone that you rang in order to acquire a witness,

270
00:15:39,408 --> 00:15:41,308
the recording that serves as proof of this,

271
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:44,308
was clearly left behind on her answer phone.

272
00:15:44,308 --> 00:15:47,208
There is one new message.

273
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:52,008
I'm not forgiving you anymore!

274
00:15:52,008 --> 00:15:53,508
I'm gonna kill you!

275
00:15:53,508 --> 00:15:55,708
Hey, Sumika.

276
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,208
Cool it.

277
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,208
Sumika.

278
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,508
Die!

279
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:04,408
Did it stop?

280
00:16:09,808 --> 00:16:12,951
But even without this answer phone recording,

281
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,308
once your wife recovers,

282
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,208
I'm sure she would testify the truth for you.

283
00:16:21,308 --> 00:16:22,708
I told you, didn't I?

284
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,708
That I was on the verge of a break up with my wife.

285
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,508
I was able to take it till just a while ago

286
00:16:28,508 --> 00:16:30,308
and the way she used to get carried away

287
00:16:30,308 --> 00:16:32,208
even if it was distasteful was cute.

288
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:37,308
But recently, she's really constantly been irritated,

289
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:40,308
saying things like, "I'm fatigued, tired or sleepy."

290
00:16:40,308 --> 00:16:42,508
She neglected doing house chores

291
00:16:42,508 --> 00:16:44,708
and threw up the food that I made.

292
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,985
These are all true.

293
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:52,308
But I did have my doubts about

294
00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:55,308
whether to go through with this murder.

295
00:16:56,408 --> 00:16:59,308
Until I heard those words come out of my wife's mouth...

296
00:16:59,308 --> 00:17:02,308
Yes! I sent mail after mail to all the girls

297
00:17:02,308 --> 00:17:04,308
that were sending you suspicious mails!

298
00:17:04,308 --> 00:17:06,708
"Die, you thief" I wrote!

299
00:17:12,108 --> 00:17:15,013
I thought something was strange.

300
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:17,408
Because I completely stopped getting invitations from my friends

301
00:17:17,408 --> 00:17:21,808
who used to ask me to go to the beach or mountains with them.

302
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:24,408
Even the woman subordinate at the company who mailed me

303
00:17:24,408 --> 00:17:26,308
saying she had something she wanted to discuss with me,

304
00:17:26,308 --> 00:17:30,008
suddenly quit the company and I haven't heard from her since.

305
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:34,008
I was totally fed up already

306
00:17:34,008 --> 00:17:37,035
of that woman who thought only about herself!

307
00:17:39,408 --> 00:17:41,808
But, what a fool I am.

308
00:17:41,808 --> 00:17:45,408
Despite having stabbed her, being that she's my wife,

309
00:17:45,408 --> 00:17:48,708
I found myself praying that I don't want her to die!

310
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,608
Knowing that if she makes it through, it's all over for me.

311
00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:55,053
Yeah, you're a fool.

312
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,055
Look!

313
00:17:57,055 --> 00:18:01,408
This is the mail that your wife sent to your woman friends.

314
00:18:01,408 --> 00:18:04,308
What she really wrote.

315
00:18:04,308 --> 00:18:06,408
What she really wrote?

316
00:18:10,308 --> 00:18:13,508
Thank you for always inviting my husband

317
00:18:13,508 --> 00:18:15,073
to go to the beach and mountains.

318
00:18:15,308 --> 00:18:20,308
Only, my husband's blood type is AB, RH minus,

319
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:24,808
so please take care that he doesn't hurt himself seriously.

320
00:18:31,408 --> 00:18:34,108
Thank you always for taking care of my husband.

321
00:18:34,108 --> 00:18:36,408
If you have something to discuss with my husband,

322
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:39,097
why not come over to our home?

323
00:18:39,308 --> 00:18:40,408
Although I may not be of much help,

324
00:18:40,408 --> 00:18:42,708
maybe as a woman who is older than you,

325
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,408
I could help in one way or another.

326
00:18:48,608 --> 00:18:50,308
Sumika.

327
00:18:52,908 --> 00:18:56,408
Your friends stopped inviting you to go to the beach and mountains

328
00:18:56,408 --> 00:18:59,117
because they were worried about your body.

329
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:03,121
The subordinate woman didn't discuss things over with you

330
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:07,125
was because she had some ulterior motive, wasn't it?

331
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,908
Anything a woman could want to talk to you about without your wife knowing

332
00:19:10,908 --> 00:19:13,508
wouldn't be anything good anyway.

333
00:19:13,508 --> 00:19:17,135
Besides, you probably got it all wrong.

334
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:19,137
Got it all wrong?

335
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:21,408
Irritable, tires easily,

336
00:19:21,408 --> 00:19:24,708
gets sleepy, fatigued, and nauseated...

337
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,908
These are all early signs of pregnancy!

338
00:19:27,908 --> 00:19:29,808
What?

339
00:19:29,808 --> 00:19:34,008
Your wife was probably lightly dressed because of this, too.

340
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:35,908
Since they are people who get feverish

341
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:40,208
due to the increase of the female hormone during pregnancy.

342
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:43,508
It seems that your wife doesn't know of this yet, though.

343
00:19:46,008 --> 00:19:47,165
By the way,

344
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:50,808
I was watching your facial expression after the surgery

345
00:19:50,808 --> 00:19:54,408
to decide whether you were really relieved that your wife was saved,

346
00:19:54,408 --> 00:19:58,708
and whether you really regretted having stabbed her.

347
00:20:00,308 --> 00:20:02,108
Well, as for me,

348
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:08,408
no matter how relieved or apologetic you are,

349
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:11,608
I wouldn't be able to forgive you even a millimeter

350
00:20:11,608 --> 00:20:15,608
because I wouldn't want to make the baby who is about to be born,

351
00:20:15,608 --> 00:20:17,608
the child of a murder who was about to kill his wife

352
00:20:17,608 --> 00:20:20,108
because of a stupid misunderstanding.

353
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:24,308
At any rate, for today, I'll explain it to the police

354
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,308
and deceive them in your favor,

355
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,908
so make sure that when your wife recovers,

356
00:20:27,908 --> 00:20:29,708
you apologize to her from the bottom of your heart,

357
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,808
and talk over what you'd like to do in the future.

358
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,808
"Several days later" -Then, just as your husband...

359
00:20:45,808 --> 00:20:48,408
and Conan had said, back at the time of the incident,

360
00:20:48,408 --> 00:20:51,229
you, in order to stop your husband's hiccups,

361
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:53,808
flung up a knife in an attempt to shock him,

362
00:20:53,808 --> 00:20:56,608
and got into a fight with your husband who thought you were serious,

363
00:20:56,608 --> 00:20:58,908
and was stabbed instead?

364
00:20:58,908 --> 00:21:03,008
Yes. I guess my acting looked very real.

365
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:07,245
I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused.

366
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:08,408
No problem.

367
00:21:08,408 --> 00:21:10,108
Well then, we'll take care of this case

368
00:21:10,108 --> 00:21:12,308
by just giving you a strict warning, this time.

369
00:21:12,308 --> 00:21:15,253
Please take care not to take things too far when fighting.

370
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:17,255
-Thank you very much. -Thank you very much.

371
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:19,908
Goodbye, then.

372
00:21:19,908 --> 00:21:22,108
Thank you so much.

373
00:21:26,508 --> 00:21:30,908
Listen. Keep your word with me, okay?

374
00:21:30,908 --> 00:21:32,408
Yeah.

375
00:21:32,408 --> 00:21:34,108
No flirting!

376
00:21:34,108 --> 00:21:37,275
Make sure you eat dinner at home!

377
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:38,608
I know.

378
00:21:38,608 --> 00:21:42,108
And, if you ever do the same thing again,

379
00:21:42,108 --> 00:21:44,708
I won't hesitate to counterattack.

380
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,008
So, keep that in mind.

381
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:50,708
Okay, Daddy?

382
00:21:53,308 --> 00:21:55,008
Yep!

383
00:23:19,008 --> 00:23:21,908
But, what a surprise! That lady...

384
00:23:21,908 --> 00:23:25,708
Yeah! Who would've thought she was trying to stop hiccups!

385
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:27,808
But she's taking it too far, don't you think?

386
00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:30,508
I guess so.

387
00:23:30,508 --> 00:23:33,391
Isn't that the lady's husband?

388
00:23:39,397 --> 00:23:41,399
He's buying a lot of toys.

389
00:23:41,608 --> 00:23:46,108
I don't think they know whether it's a boy or girl yet though.

390
00:23:46,108 --> 00:23:47,808
Talk about a doting parent.

391
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:57,908
I can't forgive even a millimeter yet, though.

392
00:23:57,908 --> 00:23:59,408
Come on...

393
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,720
Next Conan's Hint:

394
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,423
"Surfboard"

395
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,800
-I'd like to eat a little more meat. -You can't!

396
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,520
He's not going to get a millimetre close to having his way here either.
