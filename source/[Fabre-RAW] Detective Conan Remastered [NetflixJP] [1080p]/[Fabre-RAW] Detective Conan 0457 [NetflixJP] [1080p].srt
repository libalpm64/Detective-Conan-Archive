1
00:00:01,414 --> 00:00:02,714
Dazzling!

2
00:00:03,814 --> 00:00:05,814
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:05,814 --> 00:00:07,414
A big fuss is made over a handkerchief at a drama location site.

4
00:00:07,414 --> 00:00:09,214
An incident dyes even the maple leaves red.

5
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:10,814
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,814 --> 00:00:12,714
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,714 --> 00:00:15,114
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:14,642 --> 00:02:17,142
Conan, be careful.

9
00:02:18,242 --> 00:02:20,542
Don't carry yourself overboard.

10
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:25,642
-Okay. -Hey, glasses kid!

11
00:02:25,642 --> 00:02:26,742
How is it?

12
00:02:27,842 --> 00:02:31,042
Shut up. I don't see it.

13
00:02:31,042 --> 00:02:32,742
Are you sure it's this tree?

14
00:02:34,042 --> 00:02:36,342
-I wonder if he's going to be okay. -You're right!

15
00:02:36,342 --> 00:02:39,342
I wonder if the glasses kid is really going to be able to find it?

16
00:02:39,342 --> 00:02:41,442
That's not what I meant.

17
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:47,042
Hey. Is it really here or what?

18
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,142
How about it, Conan?

19
00:02:49,142 --> 00:02:51,542
Did you find Sonoko's handkerchief?

20
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:53,642
It's red! Red, okay?

21
00:02:53,642 --> 00:02:55,642
It's a precious red handkerchief!

22
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,942
So, look really good, okay?

23
00:02:57,942 --> 00:03:01,342
Why didn't you hang on to it and not let it go?

24
00:03:01,342 --> 00:03:04,442
But I don't see it anywhere at all.

25
00:03:04,442 --> 00:03:06,742
That's strange.

26
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:17,642
It looked like the handkerchief

27
00:03:17,642 --> 00:03:21,142
was blown away by the wind and got stuck on that tree.

28
00:03:22,442 --> 00:03:25,042
What? Did you find it?

29
00:03:25,042 --> 00:03:27,142
Yes.

30
00:03:27,142 --> 00:03:29,742
Well, I did find it but...

31
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:34,742
A handkerchief that was blown away by the wind

32
00:03:34,742 --> 00:03:37,942
would never tie onto a branch on its own.

33
00:03:37,942 --> 00:03:40,842
Hey! Did you find it or not?

34
00:03:40,842 --> 00:03:42,842
Come on and tell me!

35
00:03:42,842 --> 00:03:45,342
-Sonoko... -Hey, glasses kid!

36
00:03:45,342 --> 00:03:47,842
-could that thing you're stepping on be? -Are you listening?

37
00:03:47,842 --> 00:03:49,442
What?

38
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:51,042
Stepping on what?

39
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:56,642
Oh, no...

40
00:03:57,742 --> 00:03:59,642
Ran...

41
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:03,442
Sonoko.

42
00:04:05,342 --> 00:04:07,842
I guess I found it.

43
00:04:10,742 --> 00:04:12,642
Conan!

44
00:04:12,642 --> 00:04:14,842
Conan Edogawa!

45
00:04:14,842 --> 00:04:16,742
Well...

46
00:04:16,742 --> 00:04:18,442
Conan!

47
00:04:20,142 --> 00:04:25,742
"Sonoko's Red Handkerchief (Part 1)"

48
00:04:26,842 --> 00:04:28,842
Hey.

49
00:04:28,842 --> 00:04:31,042
Hey, are you listening?

50
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:34,242
Sonoko.

51
00:04:34,242 --> 00:04:38,642
Isn't it about time for you tell me?

52
00:04:38,642 --> 00:04:42,742
Why you suddenly wanted to come visit this scarlet maple leaves?

53
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:44,942
-Hey. -Yeah, that's true.

54
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:48,042
Oh, see this red handkerchief?

55
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:51,942
You can't tell even by looking at this handkerchief?

56
00:04:51,942 --> 00:04:54,042
Handkerchief?

57
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:55,842
Red?

58
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:57,742
No, not at all.

59
00:04:57,742 --> 00:05:02,342
Then you must at least know the title, don't you, Ran?

60
00:05:02,342 --> 00:05:03,642
The title?

61
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:06,942
"Red Maple Leaves in Winter".

62
00:05:06,942 --> 00:05:08,742
It's "Red Maple Leaves in Winter".

63
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:11,542
Oh! That's the super lovey-dovey drama

64
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:13,142
that was really popular last year, isn't it?

65
00:05:13,142 --> 00:05:14,442
Right...

66
00:05:18,142 --> 00:05:21,642
Don't tell me you weren't watching it.

67
00:05:21,642 --> 00:05:23,642
You like that kind of drama too, don't you?

68
00:05:23,642 --> 00:05:24,942
Yeah...

69
00:05:24,942 --> 00:05:28,142
But Yoko Okino's program was on at the same time

70
00:05:28,142 --> 00:05:31,542
and dad was watching it while recording her program so...

71
00:05:33,342 --> 00:05:36,342
He's still head over heels over Yoko Okino.

72
00:05:36,342 --> 00:05:39,742
What does that drama have to do

73
00:05:39,742 --> 00:05:42,042
with the red handkerchief though?

74
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:46,842
Well, I don't think brats can understand even if I told you about it,

75
00:05:46,842 --> 00:05:50,042
but I, Sonoko, will go out of my way and explain it to you.

76
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:51,242
Hey...

77
00:05:52,342 --> 00:05:56,642
It's about a rich family's daughter and a young military officer.

78
00:05:56,642 --> 00:06:00,142
It's a love and romance story!

79
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:03,742
They first meet because the military officer takes the handkerchief

80
00:06:03,742 --> 00:06:06,042
from a red maple tree for her.

81
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:07,842
Some time later, they fall in love with each other.

82
00:06:09,942 --> 00:06:14,942
However, a bad superior officer who envies their relationship

83
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:17,842
frames the young military officer for something

84
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:19,942
he had no recollection of doing.

85
00:06:19,942 --> 00:06:21,742
He ends up becoming a fugitive whose whereabouts become unknown.

86
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:26,342
Just about when the war is about to end,

87
00:06:26,342 --> 00:06:29,442
the young lady receives a telegram from him.

88
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:33,042
It said, "I will wait for you on New Year's day morning

89
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:35,642
under the maple tree covered with red leaves."

90
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:39,842
But New Year's day morning?

91
00:06:39,842 --> 00:06:42,142
The maple leaves all wither away in winter.

92
00:06:42,142 --> 00:06:43,442
Right.

93
00:06:43,442 --> 00:06:44,842
All the rich young lady could figure out was

94
00:06:44,842 --> 00:06:46,542
that he meant the mountain they first met

95
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:49,742
where there were maple trees covered with red leaves.

96
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,742
She had no idea as to where it actually was,

97
00:06:51,742 --> 00:06:53,442
so she walked through the snowy mountain

98
00:06:53,442 --> 00:06:56,242
looking for him all by herself.

99
00:06:58,242 --> 00:06:59,542
But, of course, all there was in the mountain

100
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:01,542
were trees with leaves that had withered away.

101
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:03,142
Viewing red leaves of maple trees in winter

102
00:07:03,142 --> 00:07:05,542
is an impossible thing to do.

103
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:08,042
She thought that "this meant we can never meet again,

104
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:10,142
so please don't wait for me."

105
00:07:10,142 --> 00:07:12,442
But, just as she was ready to give up and go.

106
00:07:12,442 --> 00:07:14,042
A certain scene strikes her eyes!

107
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:17,842
In the snowy white landscape of winter,

108
00:07:17,842 --> 00:07:20,242
a red handkerchief is tied onto a branch of a tree

109
00:07:20,242 --> 00:07:21,842
with leaves that had withered away.

110
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,242
This bright red handkerchief!

111
00:07:26,442 --> 00:07:30,942
And they finally reunite under that tree.

112
00:07:30,942 --> 00:07:33,642
They elope...

113
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:35,942
and the story ends happily ever after.

114
00:07:35,942 --> 00:07:37,842
Oh, how nice!

115
00:07:39,342 --> 00:07:42,842
That young military officer is strong, tanned

116
00:07:42,842 --> 00:07:45,942
and has a simple and honest manner of speaking. He's so awesome!

117
00:07:45,942 --> 00:07:47,742
You mean like Kyogoku?

118
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:50,142
Right! Exactly!

119
00:07:50,142 --> 00:07:53,742
I watched the DVD again the other day and got hooked on it!

120
00:07:53,742 --> 00:07:55,142
The love story of a rich young lady

121
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,542
and a strong and tanned young military officer.

122
00:07:58,542 --> 00:08:02,242
It's just like me and Makoto, don't you think?

123
00:08:04,342 --> 00:08:08,942
That's why I came to this mountain where the drama was filmed.

124
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:10,042
See!

125
00:08:10,042 --> 00:08:12,942
I came to tie my red handkerchief onto the branch of a tree!

126
00:08:12,942 --> 00:08:16,942
I see, so that you get to see Kyogoku!

127
00:08:16,942 --> 00:08:19,642
But won't you get scolded for tying it on without permission?

128
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:20,942
Don't worry!

129
00:08:20,942 --> 00:08:24,342
No one will notice just one handkerchief on the branch of a tree!

130
00:08:24,342 --> 00:08:26,942
No, I think someone will notice.

131
00:08:26,942 --> 00:08:29,742
-What? -How do you know, glasses kid?

132
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:30,842
Just how...

133
00:08:38,342 --> 00:08:40,442
Hey!

134
00:08:40,442 --> 00:08:42,542
What's that?

135
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:44,742
It's full of red handkerchiefs!

136
00:08:44,742 --> 00:08:45,942
Sonoko.

137
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:49,442
Could this be the place that was used for filming the scene in the drama?

138
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:53,042
Yes. The young military officer was waiting here

139
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:54,942
with his back leaning against a large rock.

140
00:08:54,942 --> 00:08:57,042
So I think so.

141
00:08:57,042 --> 00:09:02,142
In other words, a lot of other people felt the same way.

142
00:09:03,942 --> 00:09:05,642
What shall I do, Ran?

143
00:09:05,642 --> 00:09:08,842
-I already e-mailed Makoto about it! -What?

144
00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:10,142
I wrote, "I'll be waiting for you under a maple tree

145
00:09:10,142 --> 00:09:13,142
with red leaves on the eve of eve."

146
00:09:13,142 --> 00:09:15,342
What shall I do?

147
00:09:15,342 --> 00:09:17,442
Sonoko, you're really something.

148
00:09:17,442 --> 00:09:20,142
You actually send e-mails with such implications.

149
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,642
But I'm sure you'll get to see him!

150
00:09:21,642 --> 00:09:23,942
I mean, there are so many handkerchiefs tied on here so...

151
00:09:23,942 --> 00:09:26,742
I'm sure that if you wait around here, he'll come and meet you.

152
00:09:26,742 --> 00:09:28,242
Sonoko?

153
00:09:28,242 --> 00:09:32,042
It doesn't mean a thing if he doesn't come under my handkerchief!

154
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:35,242
Come to think of it, I found one too.

155
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,242
Found what?

156
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,542
A red handkerchief was tied to the branch of the tree

157
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:41,342
that I climbed on just a while ago.

158
00:09:41,342 --> 00:09:42,842
No way!

159
00:09:42,842 --> 00:09:45,842
That place is quite some distance from here!

160
00:09:45,842 --> 00:09:48,342
What if handkerchiefs are tied onto the branches of

161
00:09:48,342 --> 00:09:50,642
every maple tree in this area?

162
00:09:50,642 --> 00:09:53,142
Where is Makoto...

163
00:09:53,142 --> 00:09:56,442
Where is Makoto supposed to wait for me?

164
00:09:57,642 --> 00:09:59,142
Even before you worry about something like that,

165
00:09:59,142 --> 00:10:01,342
I wonder if that martial arts freak would know anything

166
00:10:01,342 --> 00:10:04,342
about where the "Red Maple Tree in Winter" was filmed.

167
00:10:06,842 --> 00:10:09,642
Okay, then as a last resort...

168
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,142
Here, glasses kid, wait here.

169
00:10:12,142 --> 00:10:13,542
Oh, okay.

170
00:10:13,542 --> 00:10:15,742
-Ran! Come help me. -What?

171
00:10:15,742 --> 00:10:18,742
We're going to remove all the red handkerchiefs on this mountain!

172
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:19,842
What?

173
00:10:19,842 --> 00:10:21,642
Hey, Sonoko.

174
00:10:21,642 --> 00:10:25,542
The fate of Makoto and I depends on this!

175
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,842
Sonoko...

176
00:10:27,842 --> 00:10:30,042
Is she okay or what?

177
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:31,342
Makoto...

178
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:35,342
Sonoko, look out.

179
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:37,542
Sonoko...

180
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:39,042
I'm sorry

181
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:41,642
that it turned out like this just because of me.

182
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,742
-Oh? -What?

183
00:10:43,742 --> 00:10:45,442
You're removing all those handkerchiefs

184
00:10:45,442 --> 00:10:46,442
because they'll get in the way of

185
00:10:46,442 --> 00:10:48,442
viewing the red leaves of the maple trees, right?

186
00:10:48,442 --> 00:10:51,742
Yes, sort of.

187
00:10:51,742 --> 00:10:54,642
What did you mean when you said just because of you?

188
00:10:57,242 --> 00:11:00,842
Aren't you the one who wrote the original "Red Maple Leaves in Winter"?

189
00:11:00,842 --> 00:11:02,542
I'm a great fan of yours!

190
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:05,642
Oh, no, I'm just a staff working on that drama.

191
00:11:05,642 --> 00:11:07,642
An AD (Assistant Director).

192
00:11:07,642 --> 00:11:09,742
You're not the original writer?

193
00:11:10,842 --> 00:11:12,842
I'm sorry, I disappointed you.

194
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:15,942
No, you didn't disappoint me or anything, right, Ran?

195
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,342
Oh, of course not.

196
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:20,542
But I'm the one who introduced this mountain to the playwright

197
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:23,142
who asked me if I knew of any beautiful mountain

198
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:26,542
that could be used for the drama.

199
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:28,242
This is my hometown

200
00:11:28,242 --> 00:11:31,042
and I used to play on this mountain a lot in my childhood.

201
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:34,342
And while we were looking for a place to film the drama,

202
00:11:34,342 --> 00:11:36,642
I found a red handkerchief tied to the branch of

203
00:11:36,642 --> 00:11:38,242
a maple tree covered with red leaves.

204
00:11:38,242 --> 00:11:40,842
When I told the playwright about this,

205
00:11:40,842 --> 00:11:44,742
he said that he could use the story and rewrote the script.

206
00:11:44,742 --> 00:11:47,242
-What? -Is that right?

207
00:11:47,242 --> 00:11:49,842
Then it became so popular

208
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,642
that I was scolded by the owner of the mountain

209
00:11:51,642 --> 00:11:54,942
who said that people began camping here without permission

210
00:11:54,942 --> 00:11:57,642
or tying red handkerchiefs on the branches of the trees.

211
00:11:57,642 --> 00:12:01,942
He shouted, "Thanks to you, my mountain is full of handkerchiefs!"

212
00:12:03,742 --> 00:12:05,542
Gosh.

213
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:06,942
You were too, Sonoko.

214
00:12:06,942 --> 00:12:08,542
Well, on the other hand,

215
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:11,742
the store owners of the shopping arcade and hotels are happy

216
00:12:11,742 --> 00:12:13,942
because customers have increased.

217
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,842
People hardly ever come here

218
00:12:15,842 --> 00:12:18,642
other than the season when the leaves change color.

219
00:12:18,642 --> 00:12:21,242
That's why all the calls that are made to the town offices

220
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:22,842
regarding this are referred to me,

221
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,342
so talk about tough.

222
00:12:25,342 --> 00:12:28,342
I get calls like, "Where's that mountain?"

223
00:12:28,342 --> 00:12:31,042
or "Please take me to the place the last scene was filmed."

224
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,042
Even today, I got a call from a fan

225
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:34,642
saying that he'll pay me, so to tell him

226
00:12:34,642 --> 00:12:38,542
where the original tree with the handkerchief was tied on is.

227
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,442
So, I was going around looking for that tree since this morning

228
00:12:40,442 --> 00:12:42,142
and I'm pooped.

229
00:12:42,142 --> 00:12:43,842
I feel sorry for you.

230
00:12:43,842 --> 00:12:44,942
You can say that again.

231
00:12:44,942 --> 00:12:46,542
Oh, that's right.

232
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:49,742
Will you relay a message for me?

233
00:12:49,742 --> 00:12:50,842
-What? -What?

234
00:12:50,842 --> 00:12:54,042
I forgot the phone number of that fan.

235
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:55,042
And all I want you to do is write,

236
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:57,742
"I found the tree you were looking for,

237
00:12:57,742 --> 00:12:59,942
so please come to the place

238
00:12:59,942 --> 00:13:01,642
where the rock that was used in the last scene is"

239
00:13:01,642 --> 00:13:03,942
on the message book that is placed at the lobby of Akagi Inn

240
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:06,042
right in front of the station.

241
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:10,642
I was supposed to meet that fan today at the inn

242
00:13:10,642 --> 00:13:13,242
but I don't think I want to go all the way down

243
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:15,642
and come all the way back up again just to guide that person over.

244
00:13:15,642 --> 00:13:18,242
I figure it's too tough on me.

245
00:13:18,242 --> 00:13:23,542
Oh, then I think we should put your name on that message.

246
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:25,942
Oh, I see.

247
00:13:25,942 --> 00:13:28,242
My name is...

248
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:29,242
"Hozumi."

249
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,842
If you write my name in katakana,

250
00:13:31,842 --> 00:13:33,642
I'm sure the person will know who I am!

251
00:13:33,642 --> 00:13:35,342
Are you sure writing it in katakana is enough?

252
00:13:35,342 --> 00:13:39,242
Yeah, because I only talked to the person over the phone.

253
00:13:39,242 --> 00:13:43,042
But that person said that he's a great fan of that drama

254
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:45,542
and had been here many times.

255
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:48,142
He also sent me an e-mail this morning

256
00:13:48,142 --> 00:13:50,142
saying that he checked in to the inn this morning

257
00:13:50,142 --> 00:13:51,642
and will be looking forward to hearing from me,

258
00:13:51,642 --> 00:13:53,942
so I'm sure you won't have trouble finding him.

259
00:13:53,942 --> 00:13:55,042
I already told him that if something comes up,

260
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:58,142
I'll write it in on the notebook too.

261
00:13:58,142 --> 00:14:00,042
I'm sorry and thanks.

262
00:14:00,042 --> 00:14:02,242
-Oh, okay. -Oh, okay.

263
00:14:07,942 --> 00:14:09,942
"Akagi Inn"

264
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:11,442
Let's see.

265
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:15,742
"I found the tree that you were looking for."

266
00:14:15,742 --> 00:14:18,042
"Please come to the place

267
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:21,942
where the rock that was used in the last scene is."

268
00:14:21,942 --> 00:14:23,442
"Hozumi."

269
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:27,342
I guess this'll do.

270
00:14:27,342 --> 00:14:29,942
Yes, I think that's good.

271
00:14:29,942 --> 00:14:32,042
Okay, Sonoko, let's go have something to eat.

272
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:34,842
-What? -I'm starved.

273
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:36,042
I guess so.

274
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,242
-Conan, let's go. -Okay!

275
00:14:38,242 --> 00:14:39,942
Oh? You're coming along too?

276
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:42,742
Of course, I'm going.

277
00:14:42,742 --> 00:14:45,942
Oh, no! Not Kitada again. That's sexual harassment.

278
00:14:45,942 --> 00:14:47,442
I thought so too.

279
00:14:47,442 --> 00:14:48,942
Did he try to do something to you again, Ran?

280
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:51,842
I'm really going to give it to him!

281
00:14:51,842 --> 00:14:53,742
"Message Book" -Who's Kitada?

282
00:15:53,846 --> 00:15:57,046
So, I heard Kitada was brushed off after all!

283
00:15:58,146 --> 00:15:59,846
What's the matter, Sonoko?

284
00:15:59,846 --> 00:16:03,546
You haven't been eating at all.

285
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,646
Are you feeling sick or something?

286
00:16:12,946 --> 00:16:14,446
Sonoko.

287
00:16:14,446 --> 00:16:16,646
Maybe I should go back there after all.

288
00:16:16,646 --> 00:16:18,746
Go where?

289
00:16:18,746 --> 00:16:19,946
Where we were a while ago.

290
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:21,046
What?

291
00:16:23,246 --> 00:16:24,946
To tie that handkerchief on.

292
00:16:24,946 --> 00:16:27,346
What? Right now?

293
00:16:27,346 --> 00:16:29,246
This is nothing new.

294
00:16:29,246 --> 00:16:32,346
Here goes capricious, rich young lady.

295
00:16:32,346 --> 00:16:34,346
Would you not be bothered if you were me, Ran?

296
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:37,646
This is just an example but...

297
00:16:37,646 --> 00:16:40,646
Ran, you planned to wear your favorite color, red,

298
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:43,546
to meet up with Shinichi at a certain place.

299
00:16:43,546 --> 00:16:48,046
But he saw a cute girl wearing red walks by and followed her.

300
00:16:48,046 --> 00:16:51,646
You got to meet him

301
00:16:51,646 --> 00:16:55,346
but you forgot to wear red.

302
00:16:55,346 --> 00:16:57,046
It's just like that.

303
00:16:57,046 --> 00:17:00,646
It's the same situation that I'm in now, isn't it?

304
00:17:08,546 --> 00:17:11,446
What the heck is Sonoko talking about anyway?

305
00:17:19,446 --> 00:17:21,846
Let's go, Sonoko! Right now!

306
00:17:21,846 --> 00:17:22,946
What?

307
00:17:24,046 --> 00:17:25,146
Yes!

308
00:17:30,646 --> 00:17:33,446
She gets all carried away easily.

309
00:17:38,146 --> 00:17:40,946
But with handkerchiefs tied on branches of trees

310
00:17:40,946 --> 00:17:43,046
all over the mountains here,

311
00:17:43,046 --> 00:17:44,446
even if you tie yours on,

312
00:17:44,446 --> 00:17:47,746
nobody will know which is yours.

313
00:17:47,746 --> 00:17:49,246
Don't worry!

314
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:52,646
See!

315
00:17:52,646 --> 00:17:54,046
I wrote my name big enough to see on it

316
00:17:54,046 --> 00:17:56,446
and attached it to a twig like a banner.

317
00:17:56,446 --> 00:17:59,746
This way, Makoto can find it easily, right?

318
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:04,146
It's nowhere near romantic like "Red Maple Leaves in Winter".

319
00:18:10,546 --> 00:18:12,246
Sonoko?

320
00:18:12,246 --> 00:18:14,046
What?

321
00:18:15,146 --> 00:18:19,046
It's getting dark and getting kind of spooky.

322
00:18:19,046 --> 00:18:20,346
Really?

323
00:18:21,546 --> 00:18:23,146
Okay, let's hurry then.

324
00:18:23,146 --> 00:18:24,546
I'm almost done.

325
00:18:27,446 --> 00:18:28,446
"Hozumi"

326
00:18:28,446 --> 00:18:30,246
Pocket diary?

327
00:18:30,246 --> 00:18:31,846
This pocket diary...

328
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,246
Isn't this...

329
00:18:35,246 --> 00:18:38,346
Doesn't this belong to that AD we met a while ago?

330
00:18:38,346 --> 00:18:39,746
True.

331
00:18:43,046 --> 00:18:44,746
Did he drop it?

332
00:18:44,746 --> 00:18:45,746
I guess.

333
00:18:49,746 --> 00:18:52,346
There's blood on the calendar.

334
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:56,446
It seems to have been traced with a bloody finger.

335
00:18:57,546 --> 00:19:00,746
But why April 1st?

336
00:19:00,746 --> 00:19:02,646
Besides...

337
00:19:02,646 --> 00:19:05,046
it seems to be a bit wet.

338
00:19:05,046 --> 00:19:09,046
Okay, let's turn that diary in to the police later.

339
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:12,646
Okay. Let's go, Conan.

340
00:19:12,646 --> 00:19:14,746
Okay.

341
00:19:25,446 --> 00:19:26,646
Blood...

342
00:19:29,946 --> 00:19:32,446
It's not dry yet.

343
00:19:35,446 --> 00:19:36,646
Don't tell me that...

344
00:19:42,446 --> 00:19:43,546
What?

345
00:19:44,846 --> 00:19:46,646
Conan!

346
00:19:46,646 --> 00:19:50,146
Get back here, you glasses kid!

347
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:09,846
See! It's because you run off like that!

348
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:13,446
What?

349
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,346
What's wrong, Ran?

350
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:34,746
He's the man we met a while ago, right?

351
00:20:34,746 --> 00:20:36,746
Yeah.

352
00:20:36,746 --> 00:20:39,146
The owner of the diary.

353
00:20:39,146 --> 00:20:41,246
The one who asked us to leave a message.

354
00:20:41,246 --> 00:20:43,246
The corpse is still warm.

355
00:20:44,446 --> 00:20:47,746
Not even 30 minutes have passed yet since he was killed.

356
00:20:50,246 --> 00:20:52,346
There's soil in between his fingernails.

357
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:57,546
Soil in between his nails? Why?

358
00:20:57,546 --> 00:21:02,746
Hey. I think we should call the police, shouldn't we?

359
00:21:02,746 --> 00:21:03,846
Yes!

360
00:21:13,246 --> 00:21:15,546
Hello? Is this the police?

361
00:21:15,546 --> 00:21:18,146
Soil between his fingernails.

362
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:21,046
Blood on the calendar of his diary.

363
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,846
April 1st.

364
00:21:23,946 --> 00:21:27,146
I wonder what kind of message Mr. Hozumi is trying to relay.

365
00:21:34,046 --> 00:21:38,346
Yes. A man is lying on the ground with a knife pierced through his chest.

366
00:21:38,346 --> 00:21:39,446
Yes.

367
00:21:44,446 --> 00:21:46,146
Somebody...

368
00:21:46,146 --> 00:21:47,446
I sense somebody here.

369
00:21:48,946 --> 00:21:50,446
Not only that...

370
00:21:51,846 --> 00:21:53,846
it's not only one or two people.

371
00:21:56,546 --> 00:21:57,846
What's going on?

372
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,600
Next Conan's Hint:

373
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,700
"April 1st"

374
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,400
April fool? Is it a lie or true (A homonym of 'makoto')?

375
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,860
What? Makoto? Where?
