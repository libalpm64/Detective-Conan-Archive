1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,410
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,210
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,010
Today there's an autumn treasure hunt.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,110
The Youth Detective Squad is challenged with a secret code.

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,610
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,610
A child in appearance with the I.Q of an adult.

7
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,910
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:43,250
"Secret of the Moon, the Star, and the Sun (Part 1)"

9
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,750
Dr. Agasa.

10
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,450
Is there really hidden treasure at the place we're heading for?

11
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,650
Yes, plenty of it.

12
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,350
But that's if you can use your brains to find it.

13
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,750
Yes!

14
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,050
If the Youth Detective Squad makes the scene...

15
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,650
We're sure to find a whole lot of treasure!

16
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,950
Hey, Dr. Agasa.

17
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,950
What is it?

18
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,650
The treasure you're talking about

19
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:12,350
wouldn't be all these toys you made me buy, right?

20
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,950
Keep it a secret from the children.

21
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,050
That's why Haibara didn't come along.

22
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,250
Feeling pretty rich, ain't you?

23
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,250
The car's new too.

24
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,450
Dr. Agasa. Have you made some sort of wild machine

25
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,950
and pulled a bank into the picture?

26
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,550
Idiot! I wouldn't do that!

27
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,050
Actually, I owe it all to this.

28
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,550
Huh?

29
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,550
The Masked Yaiba?

30
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,850
A person I know has a toy company

31
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,650
and I helped them develop this new product.

32
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,950
I got a nice bundle of contract money.

33
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,050
And? What is this suppose to be?

34
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,450
Yaiba Reco-changer!

35
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,650
Surprised?

36
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,350
We got one from Dr. Agasa this morning too.

37
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,650
This Yaiba Reco-changer.

38
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,550
Yaiba Reco-changer?

39
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,450
It records your voice

40
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,650
and transforms it in all sorts of ways.

41
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,450
It's the newest Masked Yaiba item!

42
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,950
It's no different from this Bowtie Voice Changer.

43
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,150
Well, what do you think?

44
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,950
The "junk" you're always accusing me of inventing

45
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,150
will be on the market nation-wide.

46
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,750
What a big house!

47
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,150
Dr. Agasa, is this really your uncle's second house?

48
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,850
Yes, that's right.

49
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,350
My Uncle, Kurisuke Agasa,

50
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,950
was a quite well known man around here.

51
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,950
50 years ago, that uncle hid

52
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:47,350
a great fortune somewhere and passed away.

53
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,050
And so, this time I called you out here

54
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:55,350
to see if we could use the brains of the Youth Detective Squad.

55
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,650
Then, it's really, really true!

56
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,350
Yes. Dr. Agasa didn't come up here ahead of time

57
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,050
to hide the treasure.

58
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,550
Didn't I tell you?

59
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,850
Dr. Agasa would pull a kiddy trick like that.

60
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,450
Isn't that right, Dr. Agasa?

61
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,550
Of course.

62
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,450
You can already see right through this.

63
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,750
Search this room first!

64
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,350
Yes!

65
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,850
Where?

66
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,050
Looks like it's not here.

67
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,850
Not here either.

68
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:39,750
Doctor. Is that man in the painting your uncle?

69
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,050
Huh?

70
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,450
Yes, it is.

71
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,450
I see.

72
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,350
Looks like it's true that your uncle was really rich.

73
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,150
-What? -Look.

74
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,200
The fireplace painted in the background

75
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,200
is the same as the one in this room.

76
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,100
In other words, the artist was called out

77
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,600
to this house to do the painting.

78
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,100
To do something like that, you'd have to be rich.

79
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,800
Yes. That painting was supposed to have been done by a young artist

80
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,600
a year before my uncle passed away from illness.

81
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,200
Who is the woman with him?

82
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,400
That's Aunt Teiko,

83
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,400
his younger sister who lived here and took care of him.

84
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Uncle hated people

85
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,700
and she was the only one he accepted.

86
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,400
I heard she was a teacher at an elementary school near here.

87
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,800
After my uncle died, she went back home

88
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,500
and no one has set foot in this house

89
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,500
for the past 50 years since then.

90
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,200
But there's a lot of things left here yet.

91
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,200
Books, dishes and things.

92
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,100
In his will,

93
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,900
my uncle said that he wanted this house left alone

94
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,800
for 50 years after his death.

95
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,000
Of course, there isn't any hidden wealth left here.

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,700
And the house is already set to be broken down next month.

97
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,400
I see.

98
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
And before it's broken down,

99
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,300
you thought of having a treasure hunt

100
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,500
with the kids in this dusty house.

101
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,200
Exactly.

102
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,700
Where's the treasure?

103
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,100
Hey! Don't make a mess of the place!

104
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,500
But...

105
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,500
If you make a more detailed observation of the surroundings,

106
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,200
you'll surely find a clue.

107
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,300
That's right.

108
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,900
For example, the strange looking letters nears my feet

109
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,500
that have been obviously carved.

110
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,200
What?

111
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,500
It's true!

112
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,900
Mo, za, ri, sa, wa, so, de, ru?

113
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,400
What's this?

114
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,800
Is it English?

115
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,600
No, it's not! It's probably Arabian.

116
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,200
It's not that simple. No even Shinichi would...

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,200
Where has he gone?

118
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,100
Could he...

119
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,500
Oh, my!

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,900
Looks like even you weren't able to solve my puzzle.

121
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,200
-What? -Why, of course!

122
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,000
I thought about it for three days and three nights without sleeping.

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,400
If it's the wooden treasure box you hid, Dr. Agasa...

124
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,200
I found it under the bed in the bedroom beyond.

125
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
What?

126
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,700
I haven't peeked into the box yet,

127
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,100
but it seemed a bit obvious so I covered it with a cloth

128
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,100
and pushed it further under the bed.

129
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,400
Thanks.

130
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,900
You brat.

131
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:34,700
What bothers me is the other mystery about this house.

132
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,700
The other mystery?

133
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,900
Yes.

134
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,000
What do you think about this, Dr. Agasa?

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,100
Huh? What's this?

136
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,300
It looks like an ordinary 1 yen coin.

137
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,700
I picked that up beside the bed.

138
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,500
Then, it may be something I dropped.

139
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
No, you couldn't have.

140
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,600
There was a lot of dust on it

141
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,000
and there weren't any signs around it that showed that it rolled.

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,800
One yen coins were first made in 1955, 44 years ago.

143
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,800
Something like that covered with dust found in this house means...

144
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,400
That means...

145
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,100
someone came in without permission

146
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,800
when the house was left empty?

147
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,600
No. Entering the house wasn't all he did.

148
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,900
I think he lived here for a while.

149
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,100
An old person extremely skillful with his hands.

150
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,000
Lived here? Skillful? Old person?

151
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,100
Hey, hey. What does this all mean?

152
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,700
I don't get it at all.

153
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,900
Then, compare that 1 yen coin with one of yours.

154
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,200
What?

155
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,400
Compare it...

156
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,900
What are you saying is different?

157
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,700
It's definitely thinner than my 1 yen coin,

158
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,300
and a size smaller.

159
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,600
That 1 yen coin was probably shaved from an original coin

160
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,000
and perfectly reduced to size.

161
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,500
He is an extremely skilled person.

162
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,200
And the character "country" is in an old character, isn't it?

163
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,500
I don't know if it was done deliberately or by mistake,

164
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,600
but only an elderly person would use a character like that.

165
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,600
But how can you say the person living here made this?

166
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,400
There's no mistake that it was made here.

167
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,800
It was carved while reading.

168
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,200
While reading?

169
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,400
There's fragments of aluminum

170
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
from the 1 yen coin between the pages.

171
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,600
And white hair too.

172
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,000
Also, there isn't a person who could carve

173
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,400
a 1 yen coin like that in a short time.

174
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,500
That's proof he was living here for a long time.

175
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,100
I see.

176
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,100
Then, why a 1 yen coin?

177
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,500
Well, looks like just to pass the time,

178
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,200
but I can't really say yet.

179
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,300
And I still don't know if he was living here alone too.

180
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,300
-I think there was a child here too. -Huh?

181
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,900
I found this a while ago.

182
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,400
Proof that there was a child here.

183
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,300
Here. Take a look at the underside of this vase.

184
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,600
Underside?

185
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,900
This is...

186
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,500
A child's scribbling, isn't it?

187
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,300
If it's something like that, I found some too.

188
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,300
Me too!

189
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,900
What?

190
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,700
Look! There's some on the underside of this candle stand too.

191
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,400
On the back of this plate too.

192
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,200
He must've been a rascal.

193
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,500
Rather than that, let's hurry and solve the code on the floor.

194
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,100
But this is strange.

195
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,400
My uncle has no children.

196
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,800
The old person living here must've had a child with him.

197
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,200
Dr. Agasa.

198
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,100
Do you know "the dancing doll"?

199
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,100
Dancing doll?

200
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,600
Yes. It came out in the Sherlock Holmes novel.

201
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,700
You're talking about that strange picture of dolls lined up

202
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,200
and look like they're dancing, aren't you?

203
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,300
If I'm not mistaken, that's a secret code made

204
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,500
to look like a child's scribbling.

205
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,900
Could this also be...

206
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,600
Yes, no mistake about it.

207
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,600
The vase, the plate, and the candle stand.

208
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,550
If you compare the arrangements of each,

209
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,850
you can see that the three figures

210
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,650
on the right side of each are the same.

211
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:21,150
In other words, it's a secret code with rules.

212
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,250
Right, it's a secret code.

213
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,750
What is it? You seem happy.

214
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,750
That code... can you read it?

215
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,550
Nope, I don't know anything.

216
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:39,350
Not a thing about the old person or the 1 yen coin.

217
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,350
But I'm excited!

218
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,450
The more I don't know, the more it excites me!

219
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,050
That unsurpassable curiosity inside of me!

220
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,150
The blood of a detective is being aroused.

221
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:58,050
Come to think of it, I've seen this figure somewhere before.

222
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,750
Really, Dr. Agasa?

223
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,850
Where? Where have you seen it? Tell me!

224
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,050
Don't rush me.

225
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,650
Hey, Conan.

226
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,500
Think about that secret code on the floor with us.

227
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,800
You're the only one that's slacking off in this treasure hunt.

228
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,700
Right.

229
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,900
Mo, za, ri, sa, wa, so, de, ru.

230
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,900
You can't tell what it is with just this.

231
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,000
Codes like these

232
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,800
often use a 50 sound arrangement

233
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,200
with a letter shifted before or after.

234
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,900
Using that theory, if we slide the letters back one...

235
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:41,500
Ya, ji, ru, shi, wo, ta, do, re.

236
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,700
Follow the arrow!

237
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,100
All right! Find the arrow!

238
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,800
Yes!

239
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
Hey, wait a minute!

240
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,700
What, what?

241
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,400
When we entered this room,

242
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,300
wasn't there an arrow that caught your eye?

243
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,100
Not really.

244
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,500
I didn't see anything like that.

245
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,200
Look, that clock.

246
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,900
Clock?

247
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,800
Is something wrong with that clock?

248
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,500
It's unnaturally stopped at 6:30, isn't it?

249
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,700
What's wrong with that?

250
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,500
It's just stopped because it's broken, hasn't it?

251
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,200
Take a good look.

252
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,000
On a usual clock, at 6:30,

253
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,900
the hour hand and the minute hand would be slightly apart, wouldn't it?

254
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,800
The hands being one on top of the other

255
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,100
is proof that someone fiddled with it.

256
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,600
That someone who hid the treasure.

257
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,100
In other words, the hands of that clock

258
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,200
-is the beginning arrow. -Right.

259
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,700
Then, we'll have to search below the clock next.

260
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,600
There's cards scattered.

261
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,200
The ace of spades is in the center, isn't it?

262
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,200
For some reason, it's set in place with a thumbtack.

263
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,900
You're right.

264
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,300
I see! The ace of spades is the arrow!

265
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,000
Then, the next is that chess piece!

266
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,300
Look at how the pieces are arranged!

267
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,700
The arrangement of the pieces?

268
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,200
See! If you look good,

269
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,200
you can see that it's shaped like an arrow.

270
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,500
You're right.

271
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,300
It's stuck to the board with glue so it won't come off.

272
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,800
There's no mistake about it.

273
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,100
Then, the next is...

274
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,600
It's that room!

275
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,500
Hey, there isn't an arrow anywhere in sight.

276
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,900
This is where the person who hid the treasure

277
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,300
really racked his brains.

278
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,300
Huh?

279
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,900
See. On the desk in front of the door,

280
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,400
dust has been swept away in three places, right?

281
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
That proves that something was there.

282
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,000
Something...

283
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,200
Could it be...

284
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,200
about this airplane on the floor?

285
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,300
Yes. Match it with where the dust has been swept away

286
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,900
and put it on the desk.

287
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,200
Okay.

288
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
The bed!

289
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,100
This airplane is facing the bed.

290
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,400
The treasure is definitely hidden in this bed!

291
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,300
There's a box under the bed!

292
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,000
That's probably a treasure box.

293
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,300
But that strange.

294
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,700
I definitely put the airplane there

295
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,900
-but I don't remember dropping it. -What?

296
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,400
Hurry up and open it! Hurry!

297
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,400
What?

298
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,090
This is terrible.

299
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,390
Cutting it up like this with a knife.

300
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,390
Yeah.

301
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:56,090
The person who hid this wanted to startle us.

302
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,190
You're wrong.

303
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,290
Dr. Agasa wouldn't do a thing like that.

304
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,790
Dr. Agasa?

305
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:05,190
Then, the one who hid this toy is Dr. Agasa?

306
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,590
To play a treasure hunt game here with you.

307
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:14,990
Then, from the time Dr. Agasa hid them until today...

308
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,890
Someone came here.

309
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:21,190
Yes. He probably saw the secret code Dr. Agasa left

310
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,890
and found the treasure box in the bedroom.

311
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,390
He looked inside got angry

312
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,290
and cut them up with a knife.

313
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,590
That's probably when the airplane

314
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,290
Dr. Agasa left on the desk fell to the floor.

315
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,290
But, why was he here?

316
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,690
Beats me.

317
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,090
He accidentally passed by and came in out of curiosity.

318
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,890
Or maybe...

319
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:47,790
he came in looking for something from the very beginning.

320
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,890
Looking for something? What?

321
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:53,390
Maybe it has something to do with that figure.

322
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,690
Figure?

323
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,790
You knows the ones you guys found

324
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,390
that strange code with the sun, moon, and stars lined up.

325
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:03,490
That scribbling was a secret code?

326
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,190
Probably.

327
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,090
Just maybe there really is

328
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:11,190
an unbelievable treasure hidden somewhere in this house.

329
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,390
Yes!

330
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,490
Dr. Agasa. What did the police say?

331
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:20,790
They said it's probably a bad petty thief.

332
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,390
They'll be here to check it out tomorrow.

333
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,290
Anyway, looks like it'd be best for us

334
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,990
to pull out without touching anything.

335
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,890
You're right. That secret code bugs me,

336
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,490
but we wouldn't want to mess up the scene more than this.

337
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,590
Hey! What're you doing?

338
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,190
What do you think?

339
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:45,490
We're looking for more secret codes to find the treasure.

340
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:49,790
Idiots! The criminal might still be in the area!

341
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,390
I found it, Conan!

342
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:55,290
On the back of this card, that secret code!

343
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,390
Really?

344
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,690
Look.

345
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,090
All right. Ayumi and I will take the first floor.

346
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,590
Genta and Mitsuhiko take the second floor.

347
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,690
-Let's split up and find it! -Yes!

348
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,390
Gosh.

349
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,890
Is it my imagination?

350
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,790
Conan, there's another one!

351
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,090
-Nothing here. -Nothing here either.

352
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:41,390
In total, we've found 7 more secret codes.

353
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:46,390
Cards, French dictionary, record,

354
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:51,290
airplane, wine glass, portrait,

355
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,490
and this gadget doll.

356
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,890
Come to think of it,

357
00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:00,190
my aunt used to say that my uncle liked gadget dolls.

358
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,190
And the first three we found.

359
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:07,290
Plate, candle stand, and vase.

360
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,490
Total of 10.

361
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:13,090
But you can't tell what it's all about with just this.

362
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:18,190
Right. If only there were something longer like a sentence.

363
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,490
A diary or a letter.

364
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,090
Letter?

365
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,990
That's right! I remember!

366
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,490
-Letter, the letter! -Huh?

367
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:31,990
Remember, I said that I'd seen that figure somewhere before.

368
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:36,190
I had completely forgotten that my aunt had shown it to me.

369
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,990
When you say "aunt", you mean the woman in this painting?

370
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:39,990
If I'm not mistaken,

371
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,190
you said she was an elementary school teacher.

372
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:47,290
That's right. It was about 5 or 6 years ago.

373
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,590
My aunt consulted me about an eerie letter

374
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,290
she'd been receiving once a year

375
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,190
from an unknown sender for the past 10 years.

376
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,290
If I remember right,

377
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,790
the contents of the letter were all in "hiragana"

378
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,990
and it said things like "Hello, teacher"

379
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,590
and "Please take care of yourself".

380
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,390
Isn't it just a letter from a student?

381
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:10,190
Maybe, but it was written in "hiragana" for a period of 10 years.

382
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,990
-What? -That's definitely strange.

383
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,490
And? The secret code and those letters...

384
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,390
What connections do they have?

385
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,390
It was on the letter.

386
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:23,190
That figure was drawn around the letter,

387
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,390
Iike a design.

388
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:30,090
What happened to the letters?

389
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:34,290
I didn't know what to make of it, so I had your father...

390
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,890
No! I mean I had a friend who lived in the neighborhood look at them.

391
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,790
He was a detective story novelist.

392
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,990
He showed them to Father?

393
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,390
It seemed that that novelist was busy with work,

394
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:47,690
and at first, he look like he was in a bad mood.

395
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,690
But as he looked at the letters,

396
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,590
his expression turned to one with excitement.

397
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,490
He took the letters and hid himself in the room.

398
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:59,890
It wasn't a few minutes before he came out and told me this.

399
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,990
Give this envelope to your aunt.

400
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,690
I really enjoyed it.

401
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,490
Dr. Agasa, you're like the sun.

402
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:12,190
Thanks to you, the gloominess in me has been blown away!

403
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,690
What was that envelope?

404
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,990
I haven't any idea.

405
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,390
The contents of the envelope

406
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,290
is probably how to decode the secret code.

407
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,290
What?

408
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:26,190
That novelist knew too.

409
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:30,190
This secret code was all in "hiragana".

410
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,390
Hiragana?

411
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,890
-Conan, is it true? -Yes.

412
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,490
The letter was written entirely in "hiragana" as a key

413
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:41,190
telling the reader to read the figures in "hiragana".

414
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,290
I see.

415
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,190
It's best to think that the sender of those letters

416
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,590
and the person who wrote this secret code

417
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,690
are both the same person.

418
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,890
But why did he send the secret code to my aunt?

419
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,090
He didn't want anybody but your aunt to know.

420
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,790
For example, someone was after him.

421
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,690
Come to think of it, my aunt said this.

422
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,990
A strange guy often peeks into the mailbox.

423
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,790
That's probably the guy who slashed up the toys.

424
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:18,490
Something is going on in this house.
