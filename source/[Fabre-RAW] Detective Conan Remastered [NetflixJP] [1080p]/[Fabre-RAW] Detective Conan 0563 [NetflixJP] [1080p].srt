1
00:00:02,716 --> 00:00:05,116
Friday the 13th.

2
00:00:05,116 --> 00:00:09,316
On that day, a man died.

3
00:00:09,316 --> 00:00:12,916
He was FBI agent, Shuichi Akai.

4
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:17,816
Back then, when he intervened with the Black Organization's plan

5
00:00:17,816 --> 00:00:20,616
of assassinating Mr. Yasuteru Domon,

6
00:00:20,616 --> 00:00:22,116
he took custody of one of the people of the Organization,

7
00:00:22,116 --> 00:00:25,116
a woman announcer called Rena Mizunashi.

8
00:00:25,116 --> 00:00:27,116
However, she turned out to be a CIA agent

9
00:00:27,116 --> 00:00:29,316
who managed to sneak into the Organization.

10
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,816
Although we deceived the Organization

11
00:00:32,816 --> 00:00:35,216
that tried to get her back,

12
00:00:35,216 --> 00:00:39,016
and succeeded in sneaking her back into the organization again.

13
00:00:39,016 --> 00:00:43,216
In order to prove her innocence,

14
00:00:43,216 --> 00:00:46,216
she was ordered to shoot Shuichi Akai to death.

15
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:51,816
He was summoned to come see her at Raiha Pass and...

16
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:03,016
I didn't think I was going to end here.

17
00:01:03,016 --> 00:01:05,816
I'm surprised too

18
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,916
that everything worked out so smoothly.

19
00:01:21,316 --> 00:01:25,216
As such, the FBI has driven into the Organization.

20
00:01:25,216 --> 00:01:29,216
A steel wedge that was never to be removed.

21
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,816
A large wound that was never to be erased

22
00:01:32,816 --> 00:01:35,616
was also carved into their hearts.

23
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,816
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

24
00:01:40,816 --> 00:01:43,516
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

25
00:01:43,516 --> 00:01:45,016
The Detective Squad and a band of robbers.

26
00:01:45,016 --> 00:01:47,016
The bank falls into panic with the FBI.

27
00:01:47,016 --> 00:01:48,516
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:48,516 --> 00:01:50,416
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:53,316
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

30
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:39,913
"The Detective Squad vs. The Band of Robbers: Clamorous"

31
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:44,813
Give me a break, boss.

32
00:03:44,813 --> 00:03:48,313
I'm already past the age of celebrating birthdays.

33
00:03:48,313 --> 00:03:50,313
Don't be like that.

34
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,113
We're just going to have a sip to drink.

35
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:55,013
But...

36
00:03:55,013 --> 00:03:57,613
No need for concern, Camel.

37
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,913
We just want an excuse to go take a break

38
00:03:59,913 --> 00:04:03,713
since investigation of the Organization's taking so long.

39
00:04:03,713 --> 00:04:07,013
It's your treat of course, isn't it, James?

40
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,113
Yeah.

41
00:04:08,113 --> 00:04:11,113
Now that we know, we'd better go choose good liquor!

42
00:04:11,113 --> 00:04:14,713
Hey... nothing too expensive now.

43
00:04:23,213 --> 00:04:26,613
A new member of the Organization has started moving.

44
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:29,613
He's good at gathering information, very observant,

45
00:04:29,613 --> 00:04:30,813
and has great insight.

46
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:33,113
He is dreadfully good at probing,

47
00:04:33,113 --> 00:04:34,613
and his code name is...

48
00:04:34,613 --> 00:04:35,613
Bourbon.

49
00:04:36,613 --> 00:04:39,913
It's been a while since I got that information from Rena Mizunashi

50
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:42,813
who snuck back into the Organization.

51
00:04:42,813 --> 00:04:45,113
He hasn't shown up at all yet.

52
00:04:45,113 --> 00:04:47,213
That detective-like guy.

53
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:49,113
Nope.

54
00:04:49,113 --> 00:04:51,413
Bourbon's target is probably that girl

55
00:04:51,413 --> 00:04:54,713
who is called Sherry by the Organization.

56
00:04:54,713 --> 00:04:57,113
Judging from the chain of events till now,

57
00:04:57,113 --> 00:05:00,313
it's no wonder if the Organization thinks

58
00:05:00,313 --> 00:05:03,213
that we the FBI are involved with her.

59
00:05:03,213 --> 00:05:04,813
Therefore, I was thinking that

60
00:05:04,813 --> 00:05:08,313
he would try getting in touch with us somehow.

61
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:10,013
I guess so.

62
00:05:10,013 --> 00:05:12,013
Because in the past, we used a wire-tap

63
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:14,213
like the one that girl set up,

64
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,713
and lured the Organization

65
00:05:15,713 --> 00:05:17,813
over to the Mouri Detective Agency too,

66
00:05:17,813 --> 00:05:21,013
and we, the FBI ambushed them there and attacked them.

67
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:24,613
Although it seems that the one who actually set up the wire-tap

68
00:05:24,613 --> 00:05:27,213
was that boy called Conan Edogawa.

69
00:05:27,213 --> 00:05:29,013
Come to think of it,

70
00:05:29,013 --> 00:05:30,713
he liked that liquor too, didn't he?

71
00:05:30,713 --> 00:05:33,813
-Huh? -Mr. Akai.

72
00:05:33,813 --> 00:05:35,813
He was also the one who shot at the guys

73
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:39,213
from a building 700 yards away

74
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,513
after luring them out, wasn't he?

75
00:05:43,813 --> 00:05:46,213
Huh? It wasn't him?

76
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:49,413
Yeah... I mean, it was, but...

77
00:05:49,413 --> 00:05:50,913
If Mr. Akai were around,

78
00:05:50,913 --> 00:05:54,213
we wouldn't have to be afraid of this guy called Bourbon.

79
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:56,113
We're not afraid!

80
00:05:56,113 --> 00:05:57,913
We're just waiting for the Organization

81
00:05:57,913 --> 00:06:00,013
to get impatient enough to make their move!

82
00:06:00,013 --> 00:06:02,813
Besides, Shuichi Akai is already dead!

83
00:06:02,813 --> 00:06:06,313
Don't you mention that name ever again!

84
00:06:06,313 --> 00:06:08,313
I'll see you guys back at the car.

85
00:06:08,313 --> 00:06:09,913
Oh, yes, madam.

86
00:06:13,613 --> 00:06:16,313
Be more considerate, will you?

87
00:06:16,313 --> 00:06:18,713
Because to her,

88
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:22,013
Mr. Akai was not just another FBI agent.

89
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:23,213
Yes, sir.

90
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:33,713
Huh? You're going to go steady?

91
00:06:33,713 --> 00:06:35,813
You mean with a member of the Organization

92
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:39,213
that you mentioned the other day named Ms. Akemi Miyano?

93
00:06:39,213 --> 00:06:40,613
Yeah.

94
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:43,113
So, I'd like to end my relationship with you.

95
00:06:43,113 --> 00:06:45,613
Wait, Shu!

96
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:46,813
You're going with her

97
00:06:46,813 --> 00:06:48,413
in order to investigate the Organization, right?

98
00:06:48,413 --> 00:06:51,113
I don't see why we have to end our relationship.

99
00:06:51,113 --> 00:06:53,313
It just means that it's an Organization that I have to crush,

100
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:57,513
even if it means sacrificing you to do so.

101
00:06:57,513 --> 00:07:01,113
I'm not a lover man who's capable

102
00:07:01,113 --> 00:07:03,613
of loving two women at the same time, you see.

103
00:07:05,413 --> 00:07:07,313
That would've been okay with me.

104
00:07:07,313 --> 00:07:11,313
To be able to work together with you was enough for me.

105
00:07:11,313 --> 00:07:13,813
But why, Shu?

106
00:07:13,813 --> 00:07:14,913
Why did you have to...

107
00:07:14,913 --> 00:07:17,213
leave so soon...

108
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:27,313
Shu?

109
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:32,413
Wait up.

110
00:07:32,413 --> 00:07:33,913
Shu, wait.

111
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:36,813
Shu...

112
00:07:41,913 --> 00:07:43,213
No doubt about it.

113
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,213
That's Shu.

114
00:07:45,213 --> 00:07:47,313
But, he's supposed to dead.

115
00:07:47,313 --> 00:07:50,113
Don't tell me he's another man who just resembles him?

116
00:07:50,113 --> 00:07:52,813
I've got to go and make sure.

117
00:07:52,813 --> 00:07:55,113
I've got to meet him and make sure.

118
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,513
What's up?

119
00:08:01,513 --> 00:08:05,113
I don't remember parking my car over here.

120
00:08:05,113 --> 00:08:07,413
Oh well...

121
00:08:07,413 --> 00:08:10,413
Don't tell me you saw someone from the Organization?

122
00:08:10,413 --> 00:08:12,413
It's nothing like that.

123
00:08:12,413 --> 00:08:15,013
I just got lost.

124
00:08:15,013 --> 00:08:17,413
Did you get to buy good liquor?

125
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:22,413
No, I couldn't use my credit card at that shop.

126
00:08:22,413 --> 00:08:25,313
I didn't have any yen on hand either.

127
00:08:25,313 --> 00:08:27,113
I hate to do this to you,

128
00:08:27,113 --> 00:08:28,813
but could you pay the bill for us?

129
00:08:28,813 --> 00:08:32,013
What? I was thinking of withdrawing money today,

130
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:33,713
so my wallet's empty.

131
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:36,213
Is that so...

132
00:08:36,213 --> 00:08:38,713
I'll go to a nearby bank then,

133
00:08:38,713 --> 00:08:40,213
so please wait for me at the shop we just went to.

134
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:42,213
Yeah, thanks.

135
00:08:44,713 --> 00:08:47,013
No...

136
00:08:47,013 --> 00:08:48,613
I'm sure that he's someone else.

137
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:50,313
That was just an illusion,

138
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:51,313
it wasn't Shu.

139
00:08:53,513 --> 00:08:56,313
"Teito Bank"

140
00:08:56,313 --> 00:08:58,513
Mitsuhiko, you're going to deposit

141
00:08:58,513 --> 00:09:00,213
all of your New Year's allowance.

142
00:09:00,213 --> 00:09:04,313
Yes, because my parents made a bank account for me the other day.

143
00:09:04,313 --> 00:09:06,113
You said that you got a lot.

144
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:09,013
Don't you think it's a waste?

145
00:09:09,013 --> 00:09:11,213
I've got sound judgment.

146
00:09:11,213 --> 00:09:13,813
Then, what did you do with your allowance, Genta?

147
00:09:13,813 --> 00:09:16,513
I'm having Mom keep all of it for me.

148
00:09:16,513 --> 00:09:19,013
She told me that she'd keep it for me

149
00:09:19,013 --> 00:09:20,913
until I find something expensive that I want.

150
00:09:20,913 --> 00:09:23,613
And... did she ever buy something for you?

151
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:25,613
Come to think of it, no.

152
00:09:25,613 --> 00:09:27,013
She'd always say that it's too extravagant

153
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:29,313
or something like that.

154
00:09:29,313 --> 00:09:31,413
Genta's mother's pretty shrewd.

155
00:09:31,413 --> 00:09:34,813
Well, she could be saving it for the time

156
00:09:34,813 --> 00:09:37,213
when you fall ill of a serious illness or something.

157
00:09:37,213 --> 00:09:39,713
That's the same as putting the money in your bank account.

158
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:42,013
I'm going to get all the money

159
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:44,013
that I have her keeping for me back.

160
00:09:44,013 --> 00:09:47,513
-Hey... -Besides, I never get sick.

161
00:09:49,413 --> 00:09:53,113
It's hurt... my stomach suddenly...

162
00:09:53,113 --> 00:09:55,213
Are you all right, Genta?

163
00:09:55,213 --> 00:09:58,013
Are you sure you didn't eat something that you shouldn't have?

164
00:09:58,013 --> 00:10:01,213
I had two servings of curry rice for lunch.

165
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:03,513
But, when I went to get you a while ago,

166
00:10:03,513 --> 00:10:05,313
you had kinako around your mouth, right?

167
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,513
After I ate the curry,

168
00:10:07,513 --> 00:10:09,513
I wanted to eat something sweet,

169
00:10:09,513 --> 00:10:11,613
so I grilled the rice cake that was in the refrigerator

170
00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:12,913
and made kinako mochi.

171
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:15,013
I ate four of that.

172
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:18,713
Then, I started craving for something salty next.

173
00:10:18,713 --> 00:10:20,513
So, I put soy sauce on them,

174
00:10:20,513 --> 00:10:22,913
and ate three of them wrapped with seaweed.

175
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,513
You just ate too much.

176
00:10:26,413 --> 00:10:28,613
I tell you, Genta.

177
00:10:28,613 --> 00:10:30,313
I'll go to a nearby pharmacy

178
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:32,113
and get you some stomach medicine then.

179
00:10:32,113 --> 00:10:33,113
Go to the bathroom

180
00:10:33,113 --> 00:10:34,313
and let out what you have to.

181
00:10:34,313 --> 00:10:36,313
Okay.

182
00:10:38,713 --> 00:10:40,313
I'm sure that all his allowance will disappear

183
00:10:40,313 --> 00:10:41,813
just paying for his food bills.

184
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:43,113
You can say that again.

185
00:10:45,413 --> 00:10:47,613
-Wasn't that... -Your teacher, Jodie?

186
00:10:51,113 --> 00:10:53,513
She didn't notice us.

187
00:10:53,513 --> 00:10:55,513
Maybe she had something on her mind?

188
00:11:03,513 --> 00:11:05,013
Excuse me, miss,

189
00:11:05,013 --> 00:11:06,213
when using the ATM,

190
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:09,313
please refrain from using your cell phone.

191
00:11:09,313 --> 00:11:13,113
This is to prevent swindling cases that have been increasing lately.

192
00:11:13,113 --> 00:11:15,213
Cell phone...

193
00:11:15,213 --> 00:11:17,413
Just like you said,

194
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:19,113
his fingerprints were found on that cell phone

195
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:22,513
together with yours and Conan's.

196
00:11:22,513 --> 00:11:26,013
The fingerprints of the man who burnt to death just a while ago.

197
00:11:28,713 --> 00:11:31,913
Right. He died.

198
00:11:31,913 --> 00:11:34,613
You told yourself over and over again.

199
00:11:34,613 --> 00:11:36,313
And yet...

200
00:11:36,313 --> 00:11:38,513
to see an illusion like that?

201
00:11:39,513 --> 00:11:41,313
I've had enough.

202
00:11:41,313 --> 00:11:43,613
I never want to go through what I went through back then.

203
00:11:43,613 --> 00:11:47,613
Yes, just like being shot right through the chest with a bullet.

204
00:11:51,213 --> 00:11:52,213
What was that?

205
00:11:57,213 --> 00:12:00,113
Lock the entrances and exits and close the shutters!

206
00:12:00,113 --> 00:12:02,813
All of you, gather in one spot!

207
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:03,913
"Restroom"

208
00:12:03,913 --> 00:12:06,713
What's going on? That sound...

209
00:12:06,713 --> 00:12:08,513
I sure was loud.

210
00:12:08,513 --> 00:12:11,413
A gunshot. Don't tell me...

211
00:12:11,413 --> 00:12:14,413
Hey, is anything wrong?

212
00:12:14,413 --> 00:12:16,213
Genta, stay as you are.

213
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:18,413
Mitsuhiko, Ayumi, you two stay here too.

214
00:12:18,413 --> 00:12:19,813
I'll go check things out.

215
00:12:19,813 --> 00:12:21,213
Oh, Conan!

216
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:28,213
Hey! Get over here quick, and sit down!

217
00:12:37,313 --> 00:12:38,713
Get it?

218
00:12:38,713 --> 00:12:41,813
Hurry it up if you don't want to get hurt.

219
00:12:41,813 --> 00:12:43,013
Listen!

220
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,613
If you're here with a friend or with somebody accompanying you,

221
00:12:44,613 --> 00:12:46,613
stay together!

222
00:12:46,613 --> 00:12:49,613
Stay with your friends or the person you came with?

223
00:12:53,713 --> 00:12:55,813
Huh?

224
00:12:55,813 --> 00:12:57,213
Is anything the matter?

225
00:12:57,213 --> 00:12:59,913
Well, the door is locked.

226
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:02,813
Besides, things don't look right inside.

227
00:13:05,113 --> 00:13:07,113
Even the shutters closed!

228
00:13:07,113 --> 00:13:08,113
What's going on?

229
00:13:10,713 --> 00:13:12,313
Hey, what's going on?

230
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:14,913
Don't tell me that...

231
00:13:14,913 --> 00:13:18,213
This is a bank robbery?

232
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:23,113
Okay! Hurry and put the cell phones

233
00:13:23,113 --> 00:13:25,013
that you have inside this bag!

234
00:13:29,013 --> 00:13:30,513
I remember that I experienced something like this

235
00:13:30,513 --> 00:13:33,013
in the past too.

236
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:36,213
Right. That bus jack.

237
00:13:36,213 --> 00:13:40,713
But back then...

238
00:13:40,713 --> 00:13:42,413
you were there, Shu.

239
00:13:45,113 --> 00:13:47,913
Hey. You foreign lady over there.

240
00:13:47,913 --> 00:13:49,913
Don't you understand Japanese?

241
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:53,013
No, I do, a little bit.

242
00:13:53,013 --> 00:13:55,813
Then, get your cell phone out, hurry and sit down.

243
00:13:55,813 --> 00:13:57,613
Okay...

244
00:13:59,613 --> 00:14:00,613
Sorry.

245
00:14:09,213 --> 00:14:10,513
Shu...

246
00:14:11,513 --> 00:14:13,313
Shu...

247
00:14:23,142 --> 00:14:25,142
Shu.

248
00:14:25,142 --> 00:14:26,142
Are you Shu?

249
00:14:26,142 --> 00:14:27,842
You're Shu, aren't you?

250
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:29,042
Tell me that you're sure!

251
00:14:31,742 --> 00:14:34,242
Can't you tell who I am?

252
00:14:34,242 --> 00:14:36,642
Can't you talk?

253
00:14:40,742 --> 00:14:42,442
A burn mark...

254
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,242
Don't tell me that...

255
00:14:45,242 --> 00:14:48,142
you escaped from that burning Chevy?

256
00:14:48,142 --> 00:14:49,542
You must've lost your memory and ability to talk

257
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:52,142
from the shock back then.

258
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:53,842
Hey!

259
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:56,942
What's all the fuss about, foreign lady?

260
00:14:56,942 --> 00:14:59,842
Hurry up and put your cell phone inside this bag!

261
00:14:59,842 --> 00:15:02,042
Okay...

262
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:06,142
Hey, you too! Hurry up, out with it!

263
00:15:07,842 --> 00:15:10,142
Darn, you wanna get blasted away or what?

264
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:13,142
No... he can't talk

265
00:15:13,142 --> 00:15:14,842
because a shock from accident!

266
00:15:14,842 --> 00:15:17,142
The burn marks, they proof!

267
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:21,042
He cannot talk,

268
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:24,542
so I think he can't use the phone even if he has it.

269
00:15:24,542 --> 00:15:26,742
Okay...

270
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:28,842
Just sit still right there!

271
00:15:28,842 --> 00:15:30,742
Hey, you next!

272
00:15:30,742 --> 00:15:32,342
Okay.

273
00:15:32,342 --> 00:15:36,142
Either way I've got to take him to everybody at the FBI

274
00:15:36,142 --> 00:15:38,342
and help him get his memory back.

275
00:15:38,342 --> 00:15:40,642
I have to ask him about how he made it out alive

276
00:15:40,642 --> 00:15:43,742
and the burnt body remains in the Chevy.

277
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:46,542
In order to do so, I guess I have no choice

278
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:48,842
but to take care of these robbers first.

279
00:15:48,842 --> 00:15:52,142
Hey, is the head of this branch here?

280
00:15:53,942 --> 00:15:55,942
Okay, get over here.

281
00:15:55,942 --> 00:15:57,042
Hurry it up!

282
00:15:57,042 --> 00:15:59,042
Yes, sir.

283
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,842
No need to panic.

284
00:16:00,842 --> 00:16:02,442
All I need you to do

285
00:16:02,442 --> 00:16:04,642
is put all the cash in this case over here.

286
00:16:04,642 --> 00:16:06,042
Easy, huh?

287
00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:08,442
By myself?

288
00:16:08,442 --> 00:16:09,442
Yeah.

289
00:16:09,442 --> 00:16:12,442
You seem to know the details of where the money is.

290
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:17,342
Okay, next, all those with nobody or no acquaintances with them!

291
00:16:17,342 --> 00:16:18,642
Stand there on the spot!

292
00:16:21,742 --> 00:16:24,842
You guys come get this masking tape!

293
00:16:24,842 --> 00:16:26,842
Tape the eyes and mouths

294
00:16:26,842 --> 00:16:28,442
of those with somebody or acquaintances with them,

295
00:16:28,442 --> 00:16:30,842
then tie their hands behind them with the tape.

296
00:16:30,842 --> 00:16:32,142
They may be easy on the people

297
00:16:32,142 --> 00:16:34,742
if know them even a bit.

298
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:36,342
Here!

299
00:16:36,342 --> 00:16:39,842
Of course I'll tie you guys up later myself.

300
00:16:56,442 --> 00:16:59,142
That...

301
00:16:59,142 --> 00:17:01,042
I'm sorry, I'm sticking the tape on you.

302
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:03,542
Oh! Before that...

303
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:05,942
please let me go to the restroom!

304
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,242
I'm going to leak!

305
00:17:08,242 --> 00:17:10,842
The foreign lady again...

306
00:17:10,842 --> 00:17:13,142
Please!

307
00:17:14,842 --> 00:17:16,042
Okay.

308
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:18,042
But, first I'm going to cover your eyes, mouth

309
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:19,742
and tie your hands before you go.

310
00:17:19,742 --> 00:17:21,842
Okay, thank you.

311
00:17:26,942 --> 00:17:30,242
Hey! Hurry up and walk!

312
00:17:30,242 --> 00:17:33,142
"Restroom"

313
00:17:34,442 --> 00:17:36,842
Stop!

314
00:17:38,042 --> 00:17:41,042
Oh well, I guess I can let her use the men's room.

315
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:43,742
There's nobody here and it can't be seen.

316
00:17:45,242 --> 00:17:46,642
Get in!

317
00:17:51,942 --> 00:17:53,842
Okay, let me know when you finish.

318
00:18:01,842 --> 00:18:04,542
I see, with both hands tied,

319
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,842
you can't pull down your panty.

320
00:18:06,842 --> 00:18:09,442
I got no choice then.

321
00:18:27,342 --> 00:18:29,842
Just as would be expected of an FBI agent on duty.

322
00:18:31,442 --> 00:18:33,242
You're pretty good.

323
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:35,342
What brings you all here?

324
00:18:35,342 --> 00:18:36,542
We all came along with Mitsuhiko

325
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:38,542
because he wanted to deposit money into his account.

326
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:39,742
But, Genta came down with a stomachache,

327
00:18:39,742 --> 00:18:41,342
so we took him to the men's room.

328
00:18:41,342 --> 00:18:43,742
Then, we heard a loud bang.

329
00:18:43,742 --> 00:18:46,242
So we stayed hiding in the men's room.

330
00:18:46,242 --> 00:18:49,642
My stomach's okay already, though.

331
00:18:49,642 --> 00:18:52,242
And? How many robbers are there?

332
00:18:52,242 --> 00:18:53,542
Five of them.

333
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:56,142
They're all armed with guns.

334
00:18:56,142 --> 00:18:58,142
So, they're after the money?

335
00:18:58,142 --> 00:19:00,242
Yes, they were saying to put the cash

336
00:19:00,242 --> 00:19:02,242
in the case that they brought.

337
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,242
Something smells fishy.

338
00:19:05,242 --> 00:19:08,142
They divided the customers by the friends and acquaintances.

339
00:19:08,142 --> 00:19:09,542
And when collecting the cash,

340
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:11,942
they made the branch manager do it alone.

341
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,742
Besides, for some reason,

342
00:19:13,742 --> 00:19:15,742
they were all concerned about the time.

343
00:19:15,742 --> 00:19:16,742
Time?

344
00:19:18,142 --> 00:19:19,142
They seem concerned,

345
00:19:19,142 --> 00:19:23,542
but it's no problem if I take them all alone and beat them up.

346
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:24,942
Hang in there, Jodie!

347
00:19:24,942 --> 00:19:27,442
Victory is yet to come!

348
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:29,442
It's okay.

349
00:19:29,442 --> 00:19:31,342
You don't need to do anything.

350
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,442
I got worried, so I came by to check things out.

351
00:19:40,442 --> 00:19:42,142
And here he is like this.

352
00:19:42,142 --> 00:19:45,042
No good, he's completely passed out.

353
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:47,042
It'll be a pain carrying him, though.

354
00:19:47,042 --> 00:19:48,842
We don't have that much time.

355
00:19:48,842 --> 00:19:50,742
Let's take off his mask and jacket

356
00:19:50,742 --> 00:19:53,042
and seat him on the toilet seat.

357
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:54,842
It'll look like a customer who was hiding in the toilet

358
00:19:54,842 --> 00:19:57,942
got hit by the robber, right?

359
00:20:00,442 --> 00:20:01,942
Hey, hold the other end!

360
00:20:01,942 --> 00:20:03,142
Okay.

361
00:20:03,142 --> 00:20:05,942
But, I wonder who that lady is.

362
00:20:05,942 --> 00:20:08,042
Beats me.

363
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:15,342
Well, who cares who she is at this point

364
00:20:15,342 --> 00:20:17,442
because they're all going to blow up.

365
00:20:17,442 --> 00:20:19,842
That's true...

366
00:20:34,742 --> 00:20:37,642
What shall we do? Jodie got caught.

367
00:20:37,642 --> 00:20:40,642
We've got no choice, but to beat them up ourselves.

368
00:20:40,642 --> 00:20:44,042
But, they've got five on their side.

369
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,242
No, four.

370
00:20:51,742 --> 00:20:53,042
"Teito Bank"

371
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:06,642
Really bad, something really bad happened.

372
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:09,542
We surrounded the bank entirely.

373
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:12,942
And? Did the robbers make any demands?

374
00:21:12,942 --> 00:21:14,542
Nothing yet.

375
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:16,342
I see.

376
00:21:21,742 --> 00:21:22,742
Strange.

377
00:21:22,742 --> 00:21:23,942
Huh?

378
00:21:23,942 --> 00:21:25,542
At this point,

379
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:27,342
it's usual that the robbers use the hostages as their shield

380
00:21:27,342 --> 00:21:31,242
and demand ways to make it out of the bank.

381
00:21:31,242 --> 00:21:33,342
That's true.

382
00:21:33,342 --> 00:21:36,242
I'm sure they'll give in soon and come out.

383
00:21:36,242 --> 00:21:38,442
Besides, they have no way out anyway.

384
00:21:38,442 --> 00:21:39,842
I wonder about that.

385
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:45,042
I got a look inside before the shutter closed

386
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:48,542
and saw several guys armed with guns wearing masks.

387
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:51,142
In order to raid a bank dressed like that,

388
00:21:51,142 --> 00:21:53,542
they would've had to arm themselves, get into a large vehicle,

389
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:55,042
parking it right beside the bank

390
00:21:55,042 --> 00:21:58,342
and stampede in at once.

391
00:21:58,342 --> 00:22:00,642
Being as well prepared as they are,

392
00:22:00,642 --> 00:22:02,942
they take the money, yet don't split right away,

393
00:22:02,942 --> 00:22:04,742
but rather make no demands,

394
00:22:04,742 --> 00:22:06,642
and are still keeping themselves locked up in there.

395
00:22:06,642 --> 00:22:08,142
Isn't it strange?

396
00:22:09,342 --> 00:22:11,642
Maybe there's something more to this.

397
00:22:11,642 --> 00:22:13,242
Maybe they already have a way thought out,

398
00:22:13,242 --> 00:22:16,742
out of there splitting with the money and all.

399
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,700
Next Conan's Hint:

400
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,400
"Hostage"

401
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,280
It's finally show time for us!

402
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,100
But, first, I've got to eat eels over rice.

403
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,340
Hey...
