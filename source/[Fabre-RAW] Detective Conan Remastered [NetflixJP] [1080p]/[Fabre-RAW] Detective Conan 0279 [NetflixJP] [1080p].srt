1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,820
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,620
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,520
Everyone is excited for the soccer season.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,420
Conan shows his keen deduction skills.

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,020
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,920
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,120
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,110
Tokyo Spirits against Noir Tokyo.

9
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,710
The score is still locked at 0-0,

10
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,410
will they be playing an extended game?

11
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,710
Now, Hide got the ball.

12
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,510
Go, Hide, go!

13
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,810
One!

14
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:15,810
Two!

15
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,910
Three! Four!

16
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,810
Go for it! Hide, blast a shot for the goal!

17
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,910
Come on, Hide, one to one against the goalkeeper!

18
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,410
Is he going to kick for goal?

19
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,010
But, the Noir won't let him.

20
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,410
They're avalanching behind Hide!

21
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,710
The keeper dashes forward!

22
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,410
The defenders are closing in on him too!

23
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,410
Will Hide dare shoot?

24
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,710
He passed it over to the side!

25
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,510
Who is the ball headed for...

26
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,110
It's Naoki!

27
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:48,110
Goal!

28
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:51,810
Naoki broke the deadlock with his header!

29
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,610
The end of the game whistle has sounded!

30
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:03,410
The Tokyo Spirits defeated the Noir Tokyo 1-0 with Naoki's goal!

31
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,910
And won the title of the Tokyo Derby!

32
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:36,010
"Hooligan in the Labyrinth (Part 1)"

33
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,610
It was great!

34
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,010
Hide dodged four Tokyo Noir players!

35
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,810
Yeah! All the folks around us in the front row seats

36
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,910
are also got really excited!

37
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,210
He quickly dodged from left to right,

38
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,410
just like Baggio!

39
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,510
Naoki was cool too.

40
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,310
Because he had already jumped in the air

41
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,710
before Hide's pass came to him!

42
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,110
The two best strikers combination,

43
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,210
Hide and Naoki, are now back again!

44
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:06,010
But I never thought that the Spirits would have a tough game like that.

45
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,110
Yeah. I was afraid that the match

46
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,410
would go into the extended game with a score of 0-0.

47
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,910
Oh, well, it couldn't be helped.

48
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,910
What?

49
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,510
Noir Tokyo's leading players are now injured.

50
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,210
And since Higo, the center forward,

51
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,710
moved on to Big Osaka,

52
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,710
the team lacks goal-scoring players.

53
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,210
So, from the beginning, Noir aimed to tie the game

54
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,110
and played defensively to prevent making a goal.

55
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,610
I see.

56
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,510
Oh, say, Higo.

57
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,110
The game between the Noir and the Big Osaka,

58
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,610
a couple days ago was awesome!

59
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,610
Yeah. Every time Higo had the ball at his feet,

60
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,710
there were lots of booing.

61
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,510
But I wonder why the Big Osaka supporters booed him too.

62
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,010
Well, it's no wonder, isn't it?

63
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,010
Because there is really no room for a traitor.

64
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,210
Hey, hey.

65
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,210
Oh, isn't that true?

66
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,410
The guy is being hated by people on his side,

67
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,710
as well as his enemies, right?

68
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,510
Big and Noir have had a longstanding grudge against each other.

69
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,010
It's just that the Big supporters

70
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,710
can't seem to cheer for a forward striker

71
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,810
who they had considered an enemy till now.

72
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,710
Besides, Higo has scored no goals so far this season.

73
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:17,010
Well, as I recall, his name was in the headlines of a sports newspaper.

74
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,610
It said, "Higo Moving to Spain League"

75
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,910
It was in the sports news too.

76
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,510
It said that he may have joined the Big Osaka

77
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,510
to boost up his contract payment when he goes to Spain.

78
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,110
What a jerk!

79
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,410
Hey... Don't take it seriously!

80
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,310
It's just a rumor.

81
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,610
But if the rumor becomes reality...

82
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,910
I'm sure he'll be relieved.

83
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,910
Excuse me?

84
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,810
He can forget everything

85
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,310
and flee to a place far away

86
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,910
from all the booing.

87
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,010
Just kidding.

88
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,510
Hey! I think the Big Osaka also has a game today!

89
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:05,310
Yes. The game will be broadcast at 5 pm on Nichiuri TV.

90
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,010
Hey! The game's already begun!

91
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,010
What?

92
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,010
Where?

93
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,810
Today, here at Nagai Stadium.

94
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,110
The guy who is greeted by the booing is,

95
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,310
none other than this man!

96
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,210
Ryusuke Higo!

97
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,610
As you well know...

98
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,810
Look at yourself!

99
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:27,210
You deserve it because you betrayed our Noir Tokyo.

100
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,710
"Kadotake Akano (48)" -Once you fall into hell,

101
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,610
you can never climb out of it.

102
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:39,710
Hey, have you seen that guy somewhere before?

103
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,210
I've seen him!

104
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,610
I've seen him on the TV news!

105
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,410
He's been arrested often because during matches,

106
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,310
he used to throw smoke bombs into the field

107
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,510
or had huge fights in the seats when he's drunk.

108
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,210
I think his name is...

109
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,910
Kadotake Akano!

110
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,710
He's just a stupid guy who is a fanatic supporter of the Noir Tokyo

111
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,910
and is proud of being a Hooligan!

112
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,910
I hear that his name is on the blacklist

113
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:06,210
and that some stadiums refuse his entry.

114
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,510
Hey, what's a "hooligan" anyway?

115
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,710
They're wild and unruly football fans in Europe

116
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,010
under the pretense of concern for the game.

117
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:18,610
That guy has a website called "Tokyo Hooligan".

118
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,410
In his web site diary, he boastfully writes things like,

119
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,610
"I taught a supporter a lesson today" and so on.

120
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,410
So, it's not surprising that

121
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,010
he's not allowed entry to the stadium.

122
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,810
I see...

123
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,010
Hey, Dr. Agasa.

124
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,410
Speaking of the web site,

125
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,110
have you checked it out?

126
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,810
-What? -You know...

127
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,510
The one I asked you about a few days ago...

128
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:45,810
About the American movie star, Chris Vineyard!

129
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,510
Oh, well... As you instructed,

130
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,810
I got into the chat room

131
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,110
and asked several fans some questions about her.

132
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,110
And?

133
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,810
But I'm not sure.

134
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,310
Chris's mother, Sharon Vineyard, is well known as a great actress,

135
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,310
but her daughter Chris' personal life

136
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,210
remains shrouded in a veil of mystery.

137
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,010
Because the only time she ever appeared before the media

138
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,910
besides shooting films was one year ago that day.

139
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,110
That day?

140
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,310
The day of her mother, Sharon's funeral!

141
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,010
A short footage was aired in Japan. Remember?

142
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,510
Oh, yeah.

143
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:25,510
Rumour has it that lousy reporters slipped into her funeral,

144
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,710
and asked a barrage of questions.

145
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,410
Like, "What school did you go to?",

146
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,710
"Is it true that you and your mother were on bad terms?",

147
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,710
"Who is your father anyway?"

148
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,310
"Isn't your rumored boyfriend attending this funeral?" and so on.

149
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,710
But she still didn't say anything at all.

150
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,810
Then frustrated by her attitude,

151
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,610
one reporter asked impatiently, "Got something you want to hide?"

152
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,510
Chris turned her back against her mother's coffin

153
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,310
and replied casually, with a smile...

154
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,910
A secret makes a woman, a woman.

155
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,310
"A secret makes a woman, a woman."

156
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:08,910
By the way, a famous Japanese actress was seen attending the funeral,

157
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,010
on the news coverage in the U.S.

158
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,410
but since Chris's remark was so impressive,

159
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:19,110
no one remembers who the Japanese woman was.

160
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,910
But is it true?

161
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:28,010
That Chris Vineyard belongs to the Black Organization?

162
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,410
I don't know for sure...

163
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,610
I don't have any conclusive evidence,

164
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,010
but if it's true...

165
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,010
If... If it's true, then?

166
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:40,410
She's gonna be a tough one to deal with for sure.

167
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,410
Tough one?

168
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,010
Shinichi, don't tell me

169
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:48,510
You're still hiding something from me.

170
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,710
So, I mean,

171
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,710
if she's an actress and also a good talker,

172
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:55,610
I just thought it's gonna be hard to corner her with my deduction.

173
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,610
By the way,

174
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,710
isn't it about time to catch a train back home?

175
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,710
Yeah, that's right.

176
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,210
Come on, you guys! We're going home!

177
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,910
Hey, wait a second.

178
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,610
They are getting to the best part now.

179
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,110
It's okay, because I have a radio now.

180
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,310
Really?

181
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,910
Let's go!

182
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,310
All right!

183
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,910
Hey, Haibara, we're going!

184
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,110
Yes...

185
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,810
What's with this train?

186
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,010
It's packed with supporters from both the Spirits and the Noir!

187
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,910
That's why I told you,

188
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,010
we should take the next train.

189
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,410
But, Genta said he wanted to hurry home, so...

190
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,410
I can't help thinking of the Big Osaka's game!

191
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,610
And I wanna watch it on TV at home, don't you?

192
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,710
Come on...

193
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,910
Hey you! That hurts! Idiot!

194
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,310
Don't push your weight around just cuz your team won!

195
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,910
I can't help it because it's so crowded here.

196
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,410
That guy is on this train too!

197
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,910
Oh, no.

198
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,210
Don't worry.

199
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,010
If we stay still, he won't mess with us.

200
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,310
That's true but...

201
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,860
Haibara.

202
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,110
Hey, how's the game going?

203
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,310
Yes!

204
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,510
With the score at 0-0,

205
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,510
the game is just going into the first half of the overtime period.

206
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:32,010
And, is player number 9 of the Big Osaka still on the pitch?

207
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,610
Higo is still playing,

208
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,910
but the booing is so loud

209
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:40,310
that his team mates seem hesitant to pass the ball to him.

210
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,910
I see.

211
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,710
Haibara?

212
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,810
If anything happens in the game, please tell me.

213
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,110
Yes, of course.

214
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,560
What?

215
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,960
Haido! Haido!

216
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,760
Transfer here for the Haido Subway line.

217
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,610
One stab in his stomach with a knife.

218
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,610
Hey, what's up, Conan?

219
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,660
Dr. Agasa! Call the ambulance and the police!

220
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,660
Got it!

221
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,860
Will I still make it?

222
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,360
Hey, station manager!

223
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,160
Don't start this train!

224
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,460
Someone's been stabbed!

225
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,160
What?

226
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,160
Please immediately call the personnel at all the wickets

227
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,760
and tell them to check all the tickets

228
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,060
belonging to Tokyo Spirits and Noir Tokyo supporters.

229
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,260
Supporters? Tickets?

230
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,760
Yes! Look only for those who bought a ticket before 5 pm

231
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,160
and keep them here!

232
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
But... Why?

233
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,860
Never mind, just do it now.

234
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,760
If you don't hurry, the killer will get away!

235
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,360
The victim is Mr. Kadotake Akano, 48 years old.

236
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,060
The murder weapon is a knife with a blade of 15cm,

237
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,360
was left at the scene of the crime.

238
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,860
When he was killed, there were a number of passengers on the train.

239
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,960
But there are no witnesses so far.

240
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,360
Oh, I think I've seen him somewhere before.

241
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,660
You've probably seen him on TV.

242
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,860
On TV?

243
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,660
This man seems to have been a notorious supporter.

244
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,260
He often made the news.

245
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,060
I see.

246
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,460
This knife's scabbard and hilt have an unusual design.

247
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,460
So if we can locate where it is sold...

248
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,660
About that...

249
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,060
I already talked to some shops about it.

250
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,460
It isn't sold here in Japan.

251
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,460
It's a rare knife from overseas.

252
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,960
So, it may take a while longer to find

253
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,560
where the killer bought the knife.

254
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,160
I see.

255
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,260
He was stabbed in a train,

256
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,360
but why is it that no one saw it happen?

257
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,760
It can't be helped.

258
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,760
Because the train was jam packed.

259
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,560
You're...

260
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,360
When the train reached this station, everybody rushed out of the train

261
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,760
and then we found that man lying on the floor.

262
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,260
And that was when we first realized that someone had been stabbed.

263
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,360
Inspector... Inspector Megure?

264
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,660
You guys again?

265
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,760
And?

266
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,860
Didn't you see anyone suspicious?

267
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,460
I don't remember.

268
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,860
Besides, everyone was dressed alike.

269
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,360
Dressed alike?

270
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,160
It was right after the soccer game,

271
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,860
so the train was full of supporters from both teams.

272
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,660
In that case, the culprit has probably already left the station

273
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,260
or changed trains, I think.

274
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,460
But...

275
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,860
In any case, I explained to the three passengers what happened

276
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,660
and told them to stay here.

277
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,560
What? How did you pick those three people?

278
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:15,060
I just did as I was told to, by this boy.

279
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,560
This boy? You mean...

280
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,860
Don't tell me he's...

281
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,160
Conan!

282
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,760
I knew it.

283
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,160
But how did you decide to pick those three people?

284
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,960
Simple.

285
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,260
In general, you can't suddenly decide to stab

286
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,760
someone to death on the train.

287
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,560
So that's why I thought...

288
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,460
that the culprit probably knew that Mr. Akano was going to be

289
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,560
on that jam packed train of supporters.

290
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,160
So, the culprit probably stabbed Mr. Akano with a knife

291
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,760
just before the train reached this station

292
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,660
at which many passengers got off,

293
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,060
and disappear into the crowd.

294
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:54,260
I see. You mean this is a planned murder.

295
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,660
Yeah! So, I asked the station manager

296
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,260
to not let the passengers dressed as supporters

297
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,760
out of the gates.

298
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,260
But why the supporters?

299
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,260
Because the train was packed full of supporters.

300
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,960
It looks less suspicious if you're dressed like a supporter, right?

301
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,760
So, were there only three supporters

302
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,460
who tried to get through the gates?

303
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,760
No. I think there were at least 50 people.

304
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,660
What? The numbers don't match at all?

305
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,860
It's the ticket.

306
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,960
Ticket?

307
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,060
The criminal had to follow Mr. Akano closely

308
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,160
and get on the same train

309
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,760
in order to stab him, right?

310
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,160
So, the culprit

311
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,660
had to buy a return ticket in advance!

312
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,160
After the game, if he lined up to buy the ticket

313
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,360
in a station full of supporters,

314
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,060
that person might lose sight of Mr. Akano.

315
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,960
The game ended at 5 pm!

316
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,060
So total of persons who had a ticket

317
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,160
with a time stamp before 5 pm

318
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,860
and tried to get through the gates at that time

319
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,960
are only those three persons.

320
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,560
I understand.

321
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,060
But still

322
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,460
what if the culprit changed

323
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,760
from the supporter's clothes to another outfit

324
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,160
or instead of going out the gate,

325
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,460
transferred to a train on the opposite platform?

326
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,460
I don't see it likely!

327
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,760
If the culprit changes clothes on the platform,

328
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,260
it'll make him look suspicious.

329
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,260
And the restroom of this station is outside the gate.

330
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,260
There are probably fewer supporters on the other side,

331
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:26,160
so there's a chance that someone would remember him.

332
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,460
While waiting for a train,

333
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:31,060
the police might come and order him not to leave.

334
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,860
The safest way is

335
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,560
to go out the gate with the multitude of supporters,

336
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,060
change his clothes in the restroom and make his getaway.

337
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,160
Haido Station is frequented by passengers who transfer to the subway,

338
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,360
so most people get off here.

339
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,560
That's true...

340
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,360
Conan.

341
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,060
I always wonder why.

342
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,260
Why are you so smart?

343
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,560
What?

344
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,160
You figured all this out just by looking at the corpse in the train

345
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,460
and gave the station manager the instructions, right?

346
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,260
No...

347
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,910
You got it wrong.

348
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:10,410
It wasn't me, but Dr. Agasa!

349
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,310
I just did as Dr. Agasa told me to do.

350
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,810
I see. It was you, Dr. Agasa.

351
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,210
Yeah.

352
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,310
Of course...

353
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:23,810
He just did what I told him to do.

354
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:27,610
No way on earth could a kid like him make a deduction!

355
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,210
How frustrating!

356
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,610
So did you figure out who did it?

357
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,710
What?

358
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,610
You have an idea who did it at least, don't you?

359
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,810
It's...

360
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,710
Well, after that, what did I instruct Conan to do?

361
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,210
Gosh.

362
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,910
Hey, Dr. Agasa!

363
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,010
Didn't you say that after the police get here,

364
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,810
you would listen to what the three people,

365
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:56,610
who were stopped at the gate, have to say.

366
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,210
Hey, hey!

367
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,310
We're being branded criminals

368
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,310
because we bought the ticket at a certain time?

369
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,710
The reason I bought a return ticket beforehand

370
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,810
was to avoid standing in line and rush-hour traffic.

371
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,210
-Me too. -Same here.

372
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:17,910
But all of you got on the train full of supporters, after all, right?

373
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,310
If you had a return ticket,

374
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,110
why didn't you go back to the station right away

375
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,510
and get on a less crowded train?

376
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,210
Because...

377
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,910
"Hasue Kira (24)" -After the game,

378
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:31,710
I got into an argument with a Spirits supporter,

379
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,810
so I arrived late at the station.

380
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,510
My seat was in the front row

381
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,410
where the Spirits and the Noir supporters

382
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,710
were sitting all mixed up together.

383
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,210
"Mitsuaki Funato (33)" -Unluckily I got a phone call from my office

384
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:45,210
just before the end of the game,

385
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,310
and the fact that I was took off from work

386
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,110
to come to the game was known.

387
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,010
I was getting yelled at for a while,

388
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,110
so I couldn't leave if I wanted to.

389
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:55,910
Thanks to it, I missed seeing the two wings score a goal.

390
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,410
"Etsutoshi Oba (29)" -I was so devastated

391
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,410
that I couldn't get up from my seat for a while after the game.

392
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:04,210
When Hide came close to the goal, dodging one defender after the other,

393
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,510
and Naoki made the goal,

394
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,010
I plunged into despair and grief.

395
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:13,210
And, which train car were you on?

396
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,610
Who would remember something like that?

397
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,910
But I'm pretty sure

398
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,510
that all three of you were on the packed train, right?

399
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,510
What?

400
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,610
Look!

401
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,610
You see there is still a mark on your right elbow

402
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,510
where the ring on your left finger was.

403
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,010
That means for a long period of time,

404
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,710
you were carrying your bag with your right hand

405
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:34,410
while holding the mouth of the bag with your left hand, right?

406
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,010
And, you, with the long hair,

407
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,410
I see a mark on your right arm from your wrist watch.

408
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,210
That means, you had your arms folded for a long period of time.

409
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,410
And you, the one wearing glasses.

410
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,710
You've got marks on both of your palms

411
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,610
because you kept a firm grip

412
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,810
on the handle of your bag with both hands, right?

413
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:53,810
You can only keep such a posture

414
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,510
for a long time on a crowded train.

415
00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:00,210
And the train had already been crowded with people before we got on,

416
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,610
you couldn't have found seats either.

417
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,310
Is what he said true?

418
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,410
Oh... Yeah.

419
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:09,510
I heard there are a lot of pickpockets in a crowded train.

420
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,910
I keep my arms crossed

421
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,310
because someone might mistake me for a pervert.

422
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:17,110
Fantastic! It's just as Dr. Agasa said.

423
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,610
Anyway it seems certain that

424
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:26,410
all of you were on that crowded train.

425
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,410
Now I want each of you to take some time to remember

426
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:31,310
which car train you were on.

427
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,310
I apologize for the inconvenience

428
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,610
but please follow me to where the crime scene is.

429
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,110
I still need to head back to work.

430
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,510
-Why do I have to do this? -Gosh.

431
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,210
What?

432
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,810
Why is that guy...

433
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,310
There are three suspects...

434
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,910
The only thing that was proven was

435
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:15,610
those three were on the crowded train.

436
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,110
But...

437
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,810
I cannot conclude anything from only that fact.

438
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,910
There must be something more.

439
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,310
Something else.

440
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,310
Another clue to solve the case.

441
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,440
Next Conan Hint:

442
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,120
"Uniform"
