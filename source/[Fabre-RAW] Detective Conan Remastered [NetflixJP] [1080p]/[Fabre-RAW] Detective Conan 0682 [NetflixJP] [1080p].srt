1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,210
Officer Takagi went off

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,410
"Meet with parents" -without telling anyone where he was going.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,810
The following day, the members of the Youth Detective Squad

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,510
were scheduled to meet Officer Takagi in front of the MPD.

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,410
However, Officer Takagi didn't show up.

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,310
Then, a man approached.

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,410
Do you know Officer Wataru Takagi, children?

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,610
Yes, we do. But why?

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,610
I couldn't have asked for better.

10
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:33,710
He asked me to hand this over to his detective girlfriend.

11
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,010
Could you do so for me?

12
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:41,310
Are you referring to Officer Sato whom we were just talking about?

13
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,310
Do you mean you also know that female detective?

14
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,310
Yes.

15
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,027
I'm sure they're getting married soon!

16
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,110
-Right! -They're really in love, you see!

17
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,810
Then, please relay this message from him to the happy female detective.

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,710
He said that it's perishable, so open it as soon as you can.

19
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,710
He also said that it will be no good

20
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,410
by tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

21
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,410
We opened the package

22
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,310
and found a tablet computer inside it.

23
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,310
When we switched it on, the screen displayed...

24
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:17,810
Officer Takagi?

25
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,510
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

26
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,610
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

27
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,410
Officer Takagi cannot budge an inch.

28
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,067
He is exhausted and is in a pinch.

29
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,069
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:32,071
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:34,710
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:16,712 --> 00:03:21,912
"A Life-Risking Love Broadcast (Crisis)"

33
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,312
Hey, how is he?

34
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,112
Is Takagi okay?

35
00:03:27,112 --> 00:03:28,187
Yes, sir.

36
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:31,812
Since three hours ago, he has been lying on his stomach.

37
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:35,512
But he looks very exhausted and weak.

38
00:03:36,712 --> 00:03:39,912
Hasn't anyone reported to have found the police memo book

39
00:03:39,912 --> 00:03:42,201
that he dropped back then?

40
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:44,812
No. Not as of yet.

41
00:03:44,812 --> 00:03:48,207
Did you manage to contact the bereaved family

42
00:03:48,412 --> 00:03:50,209
of the three people who committed suicide

43
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:52,012
that Takagi was looking through in the reference room last week?

44
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:53,512
Well...

45
00:03:53,512 --> 00:03:55,412
For the first case, the parental home of the medical student,

46
00:03:55,412 --> 00:03:58,012
Ms. Yuko Tokugi was in Kochi.

47
00:03:58,012 --> 00:04:00,219
However, it seems like they moved six months ago,

48
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:02,612
and we don't know their whereabouts yet.

49
00:04:02,612 --> 00:04:05,612
As for the second one, Ms. Natalie Kuruma,

50
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,312
she was born in Hokkaido.

51
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:09,512
Her only family, which were her parents,

52
00:04:09,512 --> 00:04:12,231
were on their way to picking up their daughter's body,

53
00:04:12,412 --> 00:04:15,912
when both of them got involved in a traffic accident and passed away.

54
00:04:15,912 --> 00:04:18,912
As for Ms. Kyoka Hikoue who worked as a hostess,

55
00:04:18,912 --> 00:04:21,612
it seems she lied about where she was from,

56
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:23,112
so her background is still unknown.

57
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:25,912
But according to stories from her fellow workers,

58
00:04:25,912 --> 00:04:28,247
she seemed to speak with a Hakata dialect at times.

59
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:31,512
Shikoku, Hokkaido and Kyushu.

60
00:04:31,512 --> 00:04:34,253
All those places are far enough that one would need to stay overnight.

61
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:36,255
If I remember correctly, all three suicides

62
00:04:36,255 --> 00:04:38,257
occurred on the same day, right?

63
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:39,412
Yeah.

64
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:42,612
It'll be a year the day after tomorrow.

65
00:04:44,012 --> 00:04:45,212
What's wrong?

66
00:04:45,212 --> 00:04:47,512
The... The image suddenly started shaking.

67
00:04:47,512 --> 00:04:48,712
What?

68
00:04:48,712 --> 00:04:51,012
Is... Is this an earthquake?

69
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:52,271
Contact the meteorological agency

70
00:04:52,512 --> 00:04:54,273
and confirm where the epicenter is.

71
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:57,512
If this is a live image, we can narrow down the location!

72
00:04:57,512 --> 00:04:58,912
Yes, sir!

73
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:01,912
It... It's shaking quite a bit.

74
00:05:01,912 --> 00:05:05,112
Hang on, Takagi!

75
00:05:05,112 --> 00:05:07,412
Shiratori! Have you found nothing yet?

76
00:05:07,412 --> 00:05:09,312
Well...

77
00:05:09,312 --> 00:05:12,712
From yesterday up until now,

78
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:16,012
no earthquake has been detected in all 47 prefectures

79
00:05:16,012 --> 00:05:17,312
throughout the nation.

80
00:05:17,312 --> 00:05:19,112
What?

81
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:21,012
Don't tell me...

82
00:05:21,012 --> 00:05:23,612
Could he be abroad?

83
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:33,812
The shaking seems to have stopped.

84
00:05:33,812 --> 00:05:36,712
This... This is a crow.

85
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:38,317
What on earth does this mean?

86
00:05:38,512 --> 00:05:42,321
It's likely that the stick or whatever the camera is fixed to

87
00:05:42,512 --> 00:05:47,412
was shaken because the crow perched on it.

88
00:05:47,412 --> 00:05:49,512
I see.

89
00:05:49,512 --> 00:05:52,012
Anyway, it is highly probable that someone related to the suicide cases

90
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:57,712
did this because he bears some sort of grudge against Takagi!

91
00:05:57,712 --> 00:05:59,312
Work with the district police station

92
00:05:59,312 --> 00:06:00,712
which has detailed information on the cases

93
00:06:00,712 --> 00:06:03,312
-and nail the suspect! -Yes, sir...

94
00:06:08,512 --> 00:06:11,112
I'm sorry to have kept all of you until so late today.

95
00:06:11,112 --> 00:06:13,112
I'm sure you're all tired from the interrogation, aren't you?

96
00:06:13,112 --> 00:06:14,353
No.

97
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:16,712
By the way, aren't you worried?

98
00:06:16,712 --> 00:06:19,612
Officer Takagi will get sleepy when nightfall comes, right?

99
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:20,712
That's right.

100
00:06:20,712 --> 00:06:23,112
If he rolls over while he sleeps...

101
00:06:23,112 --> 00:06:27,212
He'll be fine. He doesn't move much when he sleeps.

102
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:29,212
Have you slept with him before?

103
00:06:29,212 --> 00:06:31,812
You really get along well, don't you?

104
00:06:31,812 --> 00:06:34,373
You see. We take short naps together

105
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:36,812
when we're staking out.

106
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:40,379
Maybe the culprit has a grudge against Officer Takagi

107
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,812
because of one of the suicide cases.

108
00:06:42,812 --> 00:06:45,012
Maybe the case was actually a homicide,

109
00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:47,012
but Officer Takagi concluded it as suicide...

110
00:06:47,012 --> 00:06:49,912
I don't think so.

111
00:06:49,912 --> 00:06:52,912
If that's the case, the culprit would have a grudge

112
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,712
against all the other police detectives who rushed to scene,

113
00:06:54,712 --> 00:06:57,012
as well as the forensic officers.

114
00:06:57,012 --> 00:06:58,812
Besides, it doesn't seem like anybody has requested

115
00:06:58,812 --> 00:07:02,012
for any of the three cases to be re-investigated.

116
00:07:02,012 --> 00:07:03,312
I guess you're right.

117
00:07:03,312 --> 00:07:05,212
All three suicides occurred the day

118
00:07:05,212 --> 00:07:07,112
after Officer Date got into the accident.

119
00:07:07,112 --> 00:07:10,012
Since Officer Takagi was still dazed because of the incident,

120
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,612
the one who concluded that it was suicide

121
00:07:11,612 --> 00:07:13,312
was me, the assistant inspector.

122
00:07:13,312 --> 00:07:15,912
If anyone were to be hated, it would be me.

123
00:07:15,912 --> 00:07:20,212
Maybe it's the lady who went to medical school?

124
00:07:20,212 --> 00:07:23,712
Maybe she committed suicide because she ran over Officer Date?

125
00:07:23,712 --> 00:07:27,012
The person who ran over Officer Date was arrested on the spot.

126
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:28,712
Ms. Tokugi that you were referring to

127
00:07:28,712 --> 00:07:30,112
was involved in a different accident.

128
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:32,112
How about the English conversation teacher?

129
00:07:32,112 --> 00:07:35,112
Maybe she was dating Officer Takagi or something.

130
00:07:35,112 --> 00:07:36,912
No way.

131
00:07:36,912 --> 00:07:39,212
Although the word "DATE" was written

132
00:07:39,212 --> 00:07:42,212
all over the calendar in her room,

133
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:45,812
there's no way that an officer could go on dates every day like that.

134
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:48,912
Then, maybe it's the hostess?

135
00:07:48,912 --> 00:07:50,812
She probably committed suicide

136
00:07:50,812 --> 00:07:52,912
because her boyfriend was arrested by that Officer Date, right?

137
00:07:52,912 --> 00:07:55,712
Moreover, Officer Takagi was good friends with Officer Date.

138
00:07:55,712 --> 00:07:57,612
It's true that Officer Date

139
00:07:57,612 --> 00:08:00,812
was the one who arrested Ms. Hikoue's boyfriend.

140
00:08:00,812 --> 00:08:01,912
But it was a day after Officer Date passed away

141
00:08:01,912 --> 00:08:03,612
when she found out through the newspapers

142
00:08:03,612 --> 00:08:06,012
that her boyfriend was a marriage swindler,

143
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:08,467
and hung herself in despair.

144
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:11,612
There's no reason why the police should be hated for that.

145
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:14,473
Hey. I think it'd be better to ask around

146
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:18,477
for more detail about that Officer Date.

147
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:20,112
Why?

148
00:08:20,112 --> 00:08:21,912
Something is bothering me.

149
00:08:21,912 --> 00:08:23,512
Especially the fact that Officer Date

150
00:08:23,512 --> 00:08:27,512
has the same first name, "Wataru", as Officer Takagi.

151
00:08:37,212 --> 00:08:39,312
It's night time already.

152
00:08:39,312 --> 00:08:42,212
It's so cold. I'm freezing.

153
00:08:42,212 --> 00:08:44,812
I wonder if I'm going to die here.

154
00:08:44,812 --> 00:08:47,112
Well, I'm to be blamed for all this.

155
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:49,812
So, I guess God's judgment was passed on me.

156
00:08:50,812 --> 00:08:52,312
Takagi...

157
00:08:53,812 --> 00:08:55,312
This...

158
00:08:57,112 --> 00:08:59,712
I'm leaving this to you...

159
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:07,112
Officer Date!

160
00:09:07,112 --> 00:09:10,012
I... I'm counting on you.

161
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:14,012
No. Get a hold of yourself.

162
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,112
I've got to get out of here somehow

163
00:09:16,112 --> 00:09:18,212
and relay the message to that person!

164
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:24,812
For Officer Date's sake,

165
00:09:24,812 --> 00:09:26,545
I have to reveal the truth.

166
00:09:33,012 --> 00:09:35,112
Bad news, superintendent!

167
00:09:35,112 --> 00:09:37,512
I contacted the provider, and found out

168
00:09:37,512 --> 00:09:40,312
that the image is being transmitted via a server abroad after all.

169
00:09:40,312 --> 00:09:44,212
We're asking the local investigators to help us on this matter.

170
00:09:44,212 --> 00:09:46,312
Does it mean it's going to take some time?

171
00:09:46,312 --> 00:09:48,567
Moreover, even if we do figure it out,

172
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:51,012
if the transmission is being sent via several countries...

173
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:53,312
More time will be needed for an investigation.

174
00:09:53,312 --> 00:09:57,212
And by the time we find out, Takagi could have frozen to death.

175
00:09:57,212 --> 00:09:58,577
How is Takagi doing?

176
00:09:58,812 --> 00:10:00,579
He seems very weak.

177
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:02,581
He has been trying to get up

178
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:04,012
and was moving his body all night.

179
00:10:04,012 --> 00:10:06,312
I understand how cold he must be,

180
00:10:06,312 --> 00:10:08,587
but he'll tire himself out that way!

181
00:10:19,212 --> 00:10:21,912
"Police Station" -It wasn't a date?

182
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,512
Did Officer Takagi really say so

183
00:10:23,512 --> 00:10:26,312
two days ago before he left?

184
00:10:26,312 --> 00:10:27,312
Yes.

185
00:10:27,312 --> 00:10:28,912
Yumi teased him by asking

186
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:31,812
if he was going on an overnight date at a hot spring.

187
00:10:31,812 --> 00:10:33,712
But he answered with a slightly scary face,

188
00:10:33,712 --> 00:10:36,615
"It's not a date".

189
00:10:38,412 --> 00:10:41,612
By the way, you mentioned on the phone

190
00:10:41,612 --> 00:10:43,012
that you noticed something.

191
00:10:43,012 --> 00:10:46,625
The way the man who handed us the tablet talked

192
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,412
was a bit strange.

193
00:10:48,412 --> 00:10:50,312
He said, "It will be no good

194
00:10:50,312 --> 00:10:53,612
by tomorrow or the day after tomorrow".

195
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:55,312
It sure sounds strange.

196
00:10:55,312 --> 00:10:57,412
"Tomorrow, or at the latest, the day after tomorrow."

197
00:10:57,412 --> 00:10:58,912
That's how it's normally said.

198
00:10:58,912 --> 00:11:02,212
Maybe he's a foreigner who speaks Japanese well.

199
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:05,112
But he looked just like a Japanese, didn't he?

200
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:07,212
Yeah.

201
00:11:07,212 --> 00:11:08,647
Well...

202
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:10,912
Was there anyone who's related to Hokkaido

203
00:11:10,912 --> 00:11:13,712
among the three women who committed suicide?

204
00:11:13,712 --> 00:11:14,912
Yes.

205
00:11:14,912 --> 00:11:17,312
The English conversation teacher, Ms. Natalie Kuruma

206
00:11:17,312 --> 00:11:19,812
was from Hokkaido.

207
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:22,312
Then, maybe someone close to her

208
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:25,012
is the one who kidnapped Officer Takagi.

209
00:11:25,012 --> 00:11:27,312
-What? -Why is that so?

210
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,667
In the Hokkaido dialect, "the day after tomorrow"

211
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:33,212
is said as "tomorrow or the day after tomorrow".

212
00:11:33,212 --> 00:11:35,012
But why?

213
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:38,412
The teacher was probably Officer Date's girlfriend.

214
00:11:38,412 --> 00:11:40,679
Girlfriend? Officer Date's?

215
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:44,112
The word that was written on the calendar every day

216
00:11:44,112 --> 00:11:45,712
was not the English word "date".

217
00:11:45,712 --> 00:11:48,687
The word "date" is spelt D-A-T-E.

218
00:11:48,912 --> 00:11:51,712
But when it's read as a Romaji, it's pronounced as "Da-Te".

219
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:54,012
It was probably a marker showing

220
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:55,712
when Officer Date would go and spend the night.

221
00:11:55,712 --> 00:11:59,312
So, just like Officer Takagi said, he didn't go on a date.

222
00:11:59,312 --> 00:12:00,699
I see.

223
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:02,212
Since she was an English teacher,

224
00:12:02,212 --> 00:12:06,112
I assumed that the "DATE" written there

225
00:12:06,112 --> 00:12:07,912
meant the English word "date".

226
00:12:07,912 --> 00:12:10,212
Also, you mentioned that she had a date scheduled

227
00:12:10,212 --> 00:12:13,512
on the day she committed suicide, right?

228
00:12:13,512 --> 00:12:15,412
-Yes. -If she had planned

229
00:12:15,412 --> 00:12:19,612
to go out somewhere with Officer Date that day...

230
00:12:21,012 --> 00:12:24,112
she probably would've kept waiting without knowing

231
00:12:24,112 --> 00:12:26,112
that Officer Date got into a traffic accident.

232
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,012
And she might have ended her own life out of despair,

233
00:12:28,012 --> 00:12:31,012
thinking that he dumped her.

234
00:12:31,012 --> 00:12:32,731
No way.

235
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:36,735
A year later, Officer Takagi probably finally realised what happened,

236
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:40,412
and wanted to tell her bereaved family about it.

237
00:12:40,412 --> 00:12:42,112
Come to think of it,

238
00:12:42,112 --> 00:12:44,112
Officer Takagi seems to have been in tears

239
00:12:44,112 --> 00:12:46,512
while looking at the photo in the memo book.

240
00:12:46,512 --> 00:12:49,412
It's very likely that he just confirmed the photo was of Ms. Natalie's

241
00:12:49,412 --> 00:12:53,812
after he went through the papers last week.

242
00:12:53,812 --> 00:12:55,812
But wait!

243
00:12:55,812 --> 00:12:58,512
This is about Officer Date, isn't it?

244
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:00,759
It has nothing to do with Takagi, right?

245
00:13:00,912 --> 00:13:02,212
What if she had told her parents

246
00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:05,912
that Officer Date's name was not Date,

247
00:13:05,912 --> 00:13:07,412
but rather, "Wataru",

248
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,412
because it would be mistaken as "date"?

249
00:13:10,412 --> 00:13:11,912
If Officer Takagi had contacted Ms. Natalie's family

250
00:13:11,912 --> 00:13:15,412
saying that he had something to report about her,

251
00:13:15,412 --> 00:13:18,312
and that he would like to meet them, what would happen then?

252
00:13:18,312 --> 00:13:20,412
They could've mistakenly thought that the Officer Wataru from the MPD

253
00:13:20,412 --> 00:13:22,781
who dumped their daughter and drove her into suicide

254
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:26,512
had the nerve to appear to meet them a year later.

255
00:13:26,512 --> 00:13:29,912
That's why they did what they did to Officer Takagi.

256
00:13:29,912 --> 00:13:32,212
But Ms. Natalie's parents

257
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:35,512
got into a traffic accident on their way to pick up her body.

258
00:13:35,512 --> 00:13:38,212
Then, who picked up her body?

259
00:13:38,212 --> 00:13:39,412
If I remember correctly,

260
00:13:39,412 --> 00:13:42,412
it was a middle-aged man who was also an English teacher.

261
00:13:42,412 --> 00:13:45,412
He took her belongings with him, too.

262
00:13:45,412 --> 00:13:48,412
That reminds me, we just got a report from the district police station

263
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:50,809
saying that when that teacher came to get the body,

264
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:53,112
he broke down in tears.

265
00:13:53,112 --> 00:13:54,813
They also come from the same hometown

266
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:55,812
and he treats her like his daughter.

267
00:13:55,812 --> 00:13:58,012
Then there's no doubt about it.

268
00:13:58,012 --> 00:14:00,819
He is the one who kidnapped Officer Takagi.

269
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:03,612
He probably found the text mail among Natalie's belongings

270
00:14:03,612 --> 00:14:05,712
and misunderstood that Officer Takagi had dumped her,

271
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,612
and made her commit suicide!

272
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,833
We've pinned down the suspect.

273
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:17,559
His name is Ryusaku Fuemoto.

274
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:21,259
He quit his job as an English conversation teacher due to an illness

275
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:24,843
and is thought to have left for his hometown in Hokkaido last month.

276
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:27,359
His residence in Hokkaido is unknown,

277
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:31,659
but considering that he hasn't moved from the flat he used to live in,

278
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:34,359
it is highly likely that he's hiding there.

279
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:35,759
Go there on the double,

280
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:37,959
and take him into custody as soon as you find him.

281
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:39,859
Make him spit out Takagi's location!

282
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:41,159
Yes, sir...

283
00:14:57,259 --> 00:14:59,159
"Fuemoto"

284
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,359
Please come in. The door's open.

285
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,559
Finally.

286
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:15,959
You've finally found me.

287
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:19,559
While waiting for you, I was about to doze off

288
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:22,659
and accidentally push the switch of the bomb.

289
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:25,859
How about it? Is he the man?

290
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:26,905
Yeah!

291
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,859
-There's no mistake! -He's the man!

292
00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:32,459
Okay, now talk.

293
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:34,913
Tell us where Officer Takagi is.

294
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:37,959
Are you the one?

295
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:42,921
The officer who is the superior of Officer Wataru Takagi?

296
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:44,459
I see.

297
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:48,559
Just like he said, you're quite a beauty.

298
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:53,259
But it doesn't mean he's right for dumping Natalie...

299
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:58,937
Now, listen well before I knock you over!

300
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:01,659
The man you kidnapped is Wataru Takagi,

301
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:04,059
and Natalie's boyfriend was Wataru Date!

302
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:06,959
Besides, she wasn't dumped!

303
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,947
But in a mail that she sent out, she said

304
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:10,949
that Wataru wouldn't come anymore!

305
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:12,559
Of course, he wouldn't!

306
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:14,459
It was because he was run over by a car

307
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:15,859
and passed away that day!

308
00:16:15,859 --> 00:16:17,959
That... That can't be!

309
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:20,959
So, hurry up and tell us where Officer Takagi is.

310
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:27,659
Don't tell me...

311
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:29,559
Don't tell me that there was poison in the wine?

312
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:31,359
Call an ambulance! Hurry!

313
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:33,759
-Yes, madam! -Hang on!

314
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,259
He is...

315
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:36,975
Where? Where is he?

316
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:38,977
-Hurry up and tell me! -He...

317
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:46,259
Where is he?

318
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,459
Hey, Sato! What's going on?

319
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:55,659
Please report the situation! Did you take custody of the suspect?

320
00:16:55,659 --> 00:16:58,059
What's the matter? Say something, Sato!

321
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,359
-Sato? -Superintendent.

322
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:01,959
I'm sorry to say

323
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:03,859
that the death of suspect,

324
00:17:03,859 --> 00:17:07,005
Ryusaku Fuemoto was confirmed a while ago.

325
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:09,007
It seems that the wine Fuemoto was drinking

326
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:13,011
when we raided the place was laced with poison.

327
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:15,013
The suspect has passed away?

328
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:17,015
Did someone poison him?

329
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:19,359
No, a bottle of poison was found

330
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,659
near the wine bottle.

331
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:23,459
It seems that he was determined to kill himself

332
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,025
when the police arrived to start with.

333
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:29,759
Judging from the fact that he had a bomb on him,

334
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:32,359
he probably planned to blow himself to death

335
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,559
if he was taken by force.

336
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:35,033
But if he was to be given a chance to talk,

337
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:39,037
he would drink the poison and see us grieve.

338
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:42,259
The suspect seemed to have held a grudge against the police.

339
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:45,059
Did you tell him that he had it all wrong?

340
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:46,159
Yes, sir.

341
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:48,359
I told him that Officer Wataru Takagi whom he kidnapped,

342
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,359
was an officer at the MPD where Officer Wataru Date also worked at,

343
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,259
and that he had mistaken the two.

344
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:55,059
And the motive of why he thought Natalie had committed suicide

345
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:57,055
was not because Date had dumped her,

346
00:17:57,055 --> 00:18:00,059
but was because Date had died in a traffic accident.

347
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:02,159
But by the time I explained it to him,

348
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:03,859
he had already drunk the poison,

349
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:07,759
and I wasn't able to find out where Takagi is being confined.

350
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,759
Have you found any clue from the suspect's room?

351
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,071
No.

352
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:15,659
We're investigating right now, but nothing yet.

353
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:17,075
The only thing we've found

354
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:19,359
was Officer Takagi's cell phone which must've been taken by the culprit

355
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:21,079
when he was kidnapped.

356
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:24,859
There are several text mails from the suspect in his mailbox,

357
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:26,359
and among them, there's one saying

358
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:30,059
that the suspect had planned to come and see Officer Takagi in person.

359
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:33,091
However, he fell ill, so he felt very apologetic.

360
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:35,859
But he wanted Takagi to go to his place

361
00:18:35,859 --> 00:18:39,559
with the airline ticket that he had bought for himself.

362
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,359
I also found a text mail addressed to me,

363
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:43,959
which I think was written by the suspect.

364
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:45,759
It says, "I left your gift from Officer Takagi

365
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:50,059
in the bushes in front of the MPD".

366
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:55,113
So I think he intended to hand me the tablet that way.

367
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:56,359
But since he coincidentally ran into

368
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:58,359
the children who knew Takagi,

369
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:00,559
he decided to ask them to deliver the tablet instead.

370
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,459
Yes. That way, he didn't have to risk

371
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:05,559
anyone stealing it while it was left there.

372
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:06,759
Are there any other mails

373
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:10,459
that could serve as clues on where Takagi may be?

374
00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:13,159
No. All it says is they'd meet up

375
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:14,159
when Takagi got to the airport.

376
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:17,135
Then, continue investigating the residence.

377
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,859
Roger!

378
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:21,859
It's most likely that nothing will be found.

379
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:23,141
Yeah.

380
00:19:23,141 --> 00:19:24,459
All the culprit has done

381
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:27,145
is giving us a tablet which we can only use

382
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:30,059
to view the image of Takagi who has been kidnapped.

383
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:31,959
Almost all its functions have been disabled,

384
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:34,859
and everything written on the back has been scratched off.

385
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:38,559
The image is transmitted by a server abroad

386
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,259
and its source hasn't been identified yet.

387
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:43,859
If he had planned to commit suicide in front of the police to begin with,

388
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:46,359
I don't think he would leave anything behind

389
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,459
that would give away Takagi's location.

390
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:51,169
If anything, it would most likely be the suspect's hometown,

391
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:52,659
which was Hokkaido, but...

392
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:55,173
Well, I also asked the local construction site workers

393
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:57,659
to check the buildings, just to be safe.

394
00:19:57,659 --> 00:20:01,559
But as of now, we haven't received any report of Takagi being seen

395
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:04,759
in a four-storey building as seen in the image.

396
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:09,859
The only clue we have left is the image of Takagi.

397
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:12,159
If it either rains or snows,

398
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,159
perhaps we could narrow down the location.

399
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,859
The only thing that showed up in the image was a crow.

400
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:18,959
A crow showed up in the image?

401
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:19,959
Yeah.

402
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:23,759
If you have the recording, could you show it to us, too?

403
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:25,203
When it comes to animals,

404
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:27,205
I think children know more about them.

405
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:28,459
-Yeah! -Yeah!

406
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:34,859
It's just a plain crow, isn't it?

407
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,159
That's right.

408
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,959
But look, its neck is grey, see?

409
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:42,659
This is a Western jackdaw!

410
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:45,223
But if I remember correctly, this type of crow...

411
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:46,459
I'm back!

412
00:20:46,459 --> 00:20:48,759
So? Did you find out anything?

413
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:50,159
No.

414
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,859
It seems all the data in his computer has already been deleted.

415
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:55,859
I'm having them search where the bomb was attained,

416
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:57,235
but nothing has been found yet.

417
00:20:57,235 --> 00:20:58,759
I see.

418
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,659
So, how is Officer Takagi doing?

419
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,241
Don't worry. He's still alive.

420
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:05,659
Although he looks quite weak.

421
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:09,559
-Nice! -What... What's going on?

422
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,259
Officer Takagi's been moving all the while since yesterday.

423
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:14,959
I thought he was moving about because he was cold.

424
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:17,255
But actually, he was trying to cut the rope at his feet

425
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:18,959
using the corner edge of the board.

426
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:21,059
He finally succeeded in doing so!

427
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,159
I see.

428
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,559
If he hangs his legs out towards both sides,

429
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,259
it'll keep him from falling off easily.

430
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:27,759
He did it...

431
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:32,559
But what's this? What is he doing with his leg?

432
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,659
He seems to be pulling the sheet covering the board towards him.

433
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:36,759
If he covers himself with it,

434
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:39,277
he could stop his body temperature from dropping too low.

435
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:45,959
No! He dropped it.

436
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:47,285
Why?

437
00:21:49,459 --> 00:21:53,291
Maybe he wants someone to notice the sound of the sheet falling?

438
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:57,295
Officer Takagi, what are you trying to do?

439
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:00,859
Somebody...

440
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:02,659
Please notice that.

441
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,859
That's...

442
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:09,059
Wait a second! What is that?

443
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:35,059
That's...

444
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:37,659
Wait a second! What is that?

445
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:41,959
-A bomb? -What?

446
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

447
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,012
"Meteorological Phenomenon"

448
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:07,425
This is more than I can take.

449
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:08,400
What do you think you're saying?

450
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,780
That's why you're called a sissy!

451
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,429
That's tough.
