1
00:00:03,047 --> 00:00:04,547
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:04,547 --> 00:00:06,347
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:06,347 --> 00:00:07,647
The boy who witnessed the crime.

4
00:00:07,647 --> 00:00:09,247
He is hiding something and acting strange.

5
00:00:09,247 --> 00:00:11,247
Hints for the deduction are caterpillars and olive trees.

6
00:00:11,247 --> 00:00:12,647
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:14,347
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,547
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:24,126 --> 00:02:25,626
"Shimura"

10
00:02:47,926 --> 00:02:49,126
Hey, you?

11
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:27,226
"The Youth Detective Squad and Four Caterpillar Brothers"

12
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:30,226
A new friend?

13
00:03:30,226 --> 00:03:33,126
Yes! We'll have to take a side trip

14
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:34,526
but, I'll introduce to you all,

15
00:03:34,526 --> 00:03:36,326
so come with me!

16
00:03:36,326 --> 00:03:39,026
Hey, about the new friend.

17
00:03:39,026 --> 00:03:40,926
Could it be a boy?

18
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:42,826
Hey, hey.

19
00:03:42,826 --> 00:03:44,626
"Matsuura Heights"

20
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,226
What's this place?

21
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:52,626
Let me introduce you, then.

22
00:03:52,626 --> 00:03:53,626
This is Taro!

23
00:03:56,326 --> 00:03:57,626
Taro?

24
00:03:57,626 --> 00:04:00,226
Look closely behind the leaves.

25
00:04:00,226 --> 00:04:02,626
Behind the leaves, did you say?

26
00:04:05,426 --> 00:04:06,626
What is it?

27
00:04:10,826 --> 00:04:12,226
It's a caterpillar.

28
00:04:12,226 --> 00:04:13,726
And it's huge too.

29
00:04:13,726 --> 00:04:16,326
This one is Jiro!

30
00:04:16,326 --> 00:04:19,526
And the smallest one here is Saburo!

31
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:22,826
Well... Aren't they cute?

32
00:04:23,826 --> 00:04:25,726
I'm not sure that cute is the word.

33
00:04:25,726 --> 00:04:28,026
Maybe more like gross.

34
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:29,326
Gross?

35
00:04:29,326 --> 00:04:32,226
-Oh, no... -It' s true. They're really cute.

36
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:34,026
Look.

37
00:04:34,026 --> 00:04:37,326
It's eating the olive leaf with all its might with its little mouth.

38
00:04:39,026 --> 00:04:40,326
True.

39
00:04:40,326 --> 00:04:43,026
Taking a good look at it, you can see that it has horns on its bottoms.

40
00:04:43,026 --> 00:04:45,226
Yes, they're cute!

41
00:04:47,426 --> 00:04:48,826
I wonder what kind of butterflies

42
00:04:48,826 --> 00:04:50,826
they're going to turn out to be?

43
00:04:50,826 --> 00:04:52,626
Aren't they going to be swallowtails?

44
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,526
I can't wait to see them.

45
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:56,026
This caterpillar...

46
00:04:56,026 --> 00:04:58,926
I'm afraid they're not going to turn into butterflies.

47
00:04:58,926 --> 00:05:00,026
Why?

48
00:05:00,026 --> 00:05:02,226
I'm sure I saw them in my picture book some time ago.

49
00:05:02,226 --> 00:05:03,226
Hey, hey.

50
00:05:03,226 --> 00:05:05,926
Don't tell me that you carry that insect picture book wherever you go.

51
00:05:05,926 --> 00:05:07,026
Here it is!

52
00:05:07,026 --> 00:05:10,826
It is the larva of a moth called Psilogramma incretum, after all.

53
00:05:10,826 --> 00:05:12,426
Psilogramma incretum.

54
00:05:12,426 --> 00:05:14,926
Oh, so, it's not a butterfly.

55
00:05:16,126 --> 00:05:18,126
Oh, but whether it's a moth or a butterfly

56
00:05:18,126 --> 00:05:20,326
it makes no difference that it's a caterpillar, does it?

57
00:05:21,826 --> 00:05:25,126
Right! They are cute after all!

58
00:05:25,126 --> 00:05:26,126
Right.

59
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,226
Yeah...

60
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:31,926
I found Taro when I was taking a walk three days ago.

61
00:05:35,526 --> 00:05:38,526
Then the day before yesterday, Jiro,

62
00:05:38,526 --> 00:05:40,526
and yesterday I found Saburo.

63
00:05:41,526 --> 00:05:44,326
Then, maybe today you'll find Shiro?

64
00:05:46,726 --> 00:05:47,826
Hey.

65
00:05:47,826 --> 00:05:50,126
No joke, there's really another one.

66
00:05:50,126 --> 00:05:52,126
It still had other siblings.

67
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:53,926
They might be brothers!

68
00:05:53,926 --> 00:05:56,426
It's the four caterpillar brothers!

69
00:05:56,426 --> 00:05:58,026
It's strange.

70
00:05:58,026 --> 00:06:01,826
After I found Saburo yesterday, I looked really well and yet.

71
00:06:02,826 --> 00:06:06,726
It's too big to have just hatched.

72
00:06:06,726 --> 00:06:10,026
If these worms are increasing one by one everyday.

73
00:06:10,026 --> 00:06:12,926
This is a bit of a mystery.

74
00:06:12,926 --> 00:06:14,326
I wonder about that.

75
00:06:14,326 --> 00:06:17,026
Maybe they were just hidden by the leaves and not in view?

76
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:18,726
What's up you kids?

77
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:21,026
"Senkichi Matsuura (52)" -Is there something about this tree?

78
00:06:21,026 --> 00:06:23,226
Oh, good morning!

79
00:06:23,226 --> 00:06:25,326
We were looking at the caterpillars!

80
00:06:25,326 --> 00:06:26,826
Caterpillars?

81
00:06:26,826 --> 00:06:29,826
See, they're over there.

82
00:06:29,826 --> 00:06:31,426
Let's see. Ouch!

83
00:06:31,426 --> 00:06:32,726
Ouch...

84
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,226
Is something wrong?

85
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:37,126
No, I have frozen shoulder syndrome.

86
00:06:39,726 --> 00:06:41,926
This is huge.

87
00:06:41,926 --> 00:06:44,226
There are others over there, here,

88
00:06:44,226 --> 00:06:45,726
and here too.

89
00:06:47,126 --> 00:06:49,826
Really, I've got to get rid of them.

90
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,326
What?

91
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:54,326
Wait! Please don't kill the caterpillars!

92
00:06:55,526 --> 00:06:57,826
Please! They're my friends!

93
00:06:57,826 --> 00:06:59,926
Please, don't, please!

94
00:06:59,926 --> 00:07:03,526
But, I can't afford to have them eat up my precious olive tree.

95
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:05,626
Oh, but with leaves as much as these,

96
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:08,026
they couldn't possibly eat everything up, could they?

97
00:07:09,026 --> 00:07:13,026
Even if they eat the leaves they'll eventually grow back.

98
00:07:13,026 --> 00:07:17,026
A caterpillar that's been killed will never revive again!

99
00:07:17,026 --> 00:07:18,426
Okay, okay.

100
00:07:18,426 --> 00:07:20,126
I'll leave it as is!

101
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,626
But, I wonder when they started increasing like this.

102
00:07:25,626 --> 00:07:29,326
When I watered the tree last time I didn't notice them.

103
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:31,026
When was the last time?

104
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:33,526
Sundown on Thursday, so...

105
00:07:33,526 --> 00:07:35,126
it was probably four days ago.

106
00:07:35,126 --> 00:07:36,726
Four days ago...

107
00:07:36,726 --> 00:07:40,526
is a day before Ayumi found the caterpillars.

108
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,626
Grandfather used to love the olive tree,

109
00:07:43,626 --> 00:07:45,726
so he even named the coffee shop that he opened

110
00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:48,526
in front of Beika Station "Olive."

111
00:07:48,526 --> 00:07:49,526
Hi, welcome back.

112
00:07:49,526 --> 00:07:50,726
"Minoru Yoshikawa (23)" -Mr. Yoshikawa.

113
00:07:50,726 --> 00:07:52,126
"Matsuura Heights resident" -Hi.

114
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:53,826
He's...

115
00:07:53,826 --> 00:07:55,326
Do you know him?

116
00:07:55,326 --> 00:07:58,326
He's an employee at the convenience store near our elementary school.

117
00:07:58,326 --> 00:07:59,726
A convenience store?

118
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:02,226
What's the matter, Mr. Matsuura?

119
00:08:02,226 --> 00:08:05,726
Bugs were found on the olive leaves.

120
00:08:05,726 --> 00:08:07,926
Bugs?

121
00:08:07,926 --> 00:08:10,026
I drop off at the convenience store sometimes

122
00:08:10,026 --> 00:08:11,626
on my way home from school.

123
00:08:11,626 --> 00:08:13,826
I read fashion magazines.

124
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,026
Does it bug you?

125
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:17,526
It doesn't bug me, but...

126
00:08:17,526 --> 00:08:20,826
Is it normal for a first grader to be reading fashion magazines?

127
00:08:21,826 --> 00:08:25,826
Right, it seems something happened over there.

128
00:08:25,826 --> 00:08:27,226
Over there?

129
00:08:27,226 --> 00:08:29,226
You mean by Mr. Shimura's home?

130
00:08:34,626 --> 00:08:35,826
It's Officer Takagi!

131
00:08:37,126 --> 00:08:38,426
Oh, it's you guys!

132
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:40,526
You're not supposed to come in here without permission.

133
00:08:40,526 --> 00:08:42,226
Did something happen?

134
00:08:42,226 --> 00:08:43,226
Yeah.

135
00:08:43,226 --> 00:08:46,126
An old man who was living alone was murdered.

136
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,226
What?

137
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:50,026
Is he the one who found the victim?

138
00:08:50,026 --> 00:08:51,626
Yeah, he lives in the neighborhood

139
00:08:51,626 --> 00:08:53,426
and used to play shogi with the old man.

140
00:08:53,426 --> 00:08:55,726
It seems that the old man had several hundred million yen

141
00:08:55,726 --> 00:08:57,726
stashed in his drawer.

142
00:08:57,726 --> 00:09:00,726
But, the cash is gone.

143
00:09:00,726 --> 00:09:02,326
Hey, Officer Takagi.

144
00:09:02,326 --> 00:09:03,426
What are you talking about?

145
00:09:03,426 --> 00:09:05,026
Nothing really.

146
00:09:05,026 --> 00:09:08,026
Do you kids know something about the case?

147
00:09:08,026 --> 00:09:10,026
Not really.

148
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:12,526
Then, hurry on to school!

149
00:09:12,526 --> 00:09:13,526
You're going to be late!

150
00:09:13,526 --> 00:09:14,826
-Yes, ma'am! -Yes, ma'am!

151
00:09:17,926 --> 00:09:20,826
I wonder how today's case turned out?

152
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,026
I wonder if they caught the killer?

153
00:09:23,026 --> 00:09:25,926
Let's drop by on our way home!

154
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:26,926
No.

155
00:09:26,926 --> 00:09:28,826
I don't think we need to do so.

156
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:33,026
What? You found a witness?

157
00:09:33,026 --> 00:09:35,426
Yeah, a taxi driver.

158
00:09:35,426 --> 00:09:36,826
Oh, well...

159
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,826
I can't tell you about the case.

160
00:09:38,826 --> 00:09:41,326
It's okay, go ahead and tell them.

161
00:09:41,326 --> 00:09:43,526
Okay then.

162
00:09:44,526 --> 00:09:47,626
That driver happened to pass in front of the house

163
00:09:47,626 --> 00:09:50,026
last night around 10 pm.

164
00:09:50,026 --> 00:09:54,526
Then, the boy fell on his rear end in front of that man?

165
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:55,626
Yeah.

166
00:09:55,626 --> 00:09:57,726
Did you see the man's face?

167
00:09:57,726 --> 00:10:01,026
No, because I was still far away then.

168
00:10:01,026 --> 00:10:02,826
Are you sure it was a man?

169
00:10:02,826 --> 00:10:04,426
I think so.

170
00:10:04,426 --> 00:10:05,826
How old was he?

171
00:10:05,826 --> 00:10:07,126
I wonder.

172
00:10:07,126 --> 00:10:10,526
Because my attention was mainly on the boy.

173
00:10:11,826 --> 00:10:13,226
The time about 10 pm

174
00:10:13,226 --> 00:10:16,426
matches the estimated time of death of the victim.

175
00:10:16,426 --> 00:10:20,126
Although we have no conclusive evidence that the man is the killer.

176
00:10:20,126 --> 00:10:22,726
I think it's well worth checking into.

177
00:10:22,726 --> 00:10:26,526
Hey, if that man is the killer,

178
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:29,726
he probably bumped into the boy

179
00:10:29,726 --> 00:10:32,926
right after he committed the murder and dashed out of the house.

180
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:35,926
Yes! My deduction is the same too.

181
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:40,526
If that so, that boy would indeed be the criminal witness.

182
00:10:40,526 --> 00:10:42,426
You're exactly right!

183
00:10:42,426 --> 00:10:45,926
But the taxi driver didn't see the boy's face,

184
00:10:45,926 --> 00:10:48,426
and only remembers that he was wearing a white baseball cap

185
00:10:48,426 --> 00:10:50,526
and something that looked to be pajamas.

186
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:52,526
Pajamas?

187
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,826
Then, it must be a boy who lives nearby.

188
00:10:54,826 --> 00:10:58,426
Yes, and that's what I want to ask you about.

189
00:10:58,426 --> 00:11:00,626
Do you have any idea of a boy who lives near

190
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:03,826
that house that wears a white baseball cap?

191
00:11:03,826 --> 00:11:06,126
A boy who lives near that house.

192
00:11:06,126 --> 00:11:08,026
Who wears a white baseball cap?

193
00:11:08,826 --> 00:11:10,126
-It's Keiichi! -It's Keiichi!

194
00:11:10,126 --> 00:11:11,626
Keiichi?

195
00:11:11,626 --> 00:11:14,626
He's Keiichi Mitsui who is in the class next to ours!

196
00:11:14,626 --> 00:11:17,426
He went to the same kindergarten we did.

197
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:20,826
His mother died of an illness this summer.

198
00:11:20,826 --> 00:11:23,126
Before his mother died,

199
00:11:23,126 --> 00:11:25,926
she bought him a white cap.

200
00:11:25,926 --> 00:11:28,326
That's why he's always wearing that cap.

201
00:11:28,326 --> 00:11:30,126
I see.

202
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:31,526
"Conference Room"

203
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:32,626
Thank you,

204
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:34,126
I'm sorry to have taken up your time.

205
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,526
Not at all.

206
00:11:35,526 --> 00:11:37,326
You may go now.

207
00:11:43,126 --> 00:11:44,926
I guess I'll be on my way too then.

208
00:11:44,926 --> 00:11:46,726
Oh, thank you.

209
00:11:47,726 --> 00:11:48,826
How was it?

210
00:11:48,826 --> 00:11:51,626
Did Keiichi say he saw the killer's face?

211
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:53,026
Well...

212
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:55,126
I guess not.

213
00:11:55,126 --> 00:11:58,126
Right, he denied everything.

214
00:11:58,126 --> 00:11:59,826
Denied everything?

215
00:11:59,826 --> 00:12:01,226
Keiichi says

216
00:12:01,226 --> 00:12:03,026
that he didn't go out last night,

217
00:12:03,026 --> 00:12:07,126
the night before or the night before last either.

218
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:17,370
"Shimura's house" -The place where the crime was committed is here.

219
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,070
"Keiichi's house" -Keiichi's house is here.

220
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,270
"Matsuura Heights"

221
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,370
The taxi came from this side.

222
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:27,270
The boy is said to have gone to the right.

223
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:31,070
It is very likely that the boy was Keiichi but...

224
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,870
As long as he denies everything, we can't force ourselves on him.

225
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,570
Either he's scared of getting involved or...

226
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,870
Don't you have any other clue regarding the killer?

227
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,870
Well, according to the driver,

228
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,870
that man thought to be the killer was holding the top part

229
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,370
of his left arm with his right hand.

230
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,470
Left arm?

231
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,970
That man...

232
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,270
His left arm was hurting too.

233
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,470
That man?

234
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,170
The four caterpillars brothers man.

235
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,270
Four caterpillars brothers?

236
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,470
His name is Mr. Matsuura.

237
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,470
And, he lives here.

238
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,070
The same block.

239
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,270
That man had a sore left arm?

240
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,370
He said he had a frozen shoulder.

241
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,170
Frozen shoulder.

242
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,170
Shall I go see him anyway?

243
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,870
Do so, will you?

244
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,970
I'll go check on the other children.

245
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,970
I wonder if that man's the killer?

246
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,970
He didn't seem like such a bad person though.

247
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,870
But, he tried to kill the caterpillars!

248
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,970
What do you intend to do?

249
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,670
I think I'll go to Keiichi's house

250
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,170
and hear what he has to say in person.

251
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,470
But, before that...

252
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,470
It's the person we saw this morning.

253
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,870
I wonder how he found out about the case?

254
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,270
To get from this store to his apartment,

255
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,670
he doesn't have to go pass the house where the crime occurred, right?

256
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,370
Yes, that's true.

257
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,070
Maybe I'll go ask him directly.

258
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,870
Well...

259
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,570
Just when I came to the place to turn the corner to my apartment,

260
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,970
I saw people of the neighborhood turning the corner ahead,

261
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:20,770
so I went over to take a look.

262
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,570
Then, why did you come home right away?

263
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,570
I wanted to hit the sack a soon as possible,

264
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,970
because we don't have enough part-timers,

265
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,370
and I had to go to work again from afternoon.

266
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,370
He's not the culprit,

267
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,570
because his left arm looks okay.

268
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,870
Right.

269
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,370
Let's hurry over to Keiichi's place.

270
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,170
I guess so, let's go.

271
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,970
You guys, go ahead without me.

272
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,070
I want to take a look at some magazines.

273
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,970
Keiichi!

274
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,370
Ayumi.

275
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,270
What beautiful roses!

276
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,170
Ever blooming roses.

277
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,370
There's an olive tree here too!

278
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:06,670
It's very small compared to Mr. Matsuura's olive tree though.

279
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,470
There seems to be no caterpillars though.

280
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,670
Do you always take care of the plants?

281
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,870
Mother used to like them.

282
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,470
I took care of them

283
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,470
after she was hospitalized and after she died too.

284
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:23,470
Around what time does your father usually come home?

285
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,970
About 11.00 pm. Because he's busy at work.

286
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,870
Then, you're all by yourself till then, Keiichi?

287
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,270
What about dinner?

288
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,070
Father makes it before he goes to work in the morning.

289
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,070
I heat it up and eat it.

290
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,370
You're having it tough, aren't you?

291
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,970
Not really, because I've gotten used to it.

292
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:45,270
And, about last night...

293
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,670
Sorry, I've got something to do so I got to go.

294
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,070
Keiichi, wait!

295
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,370
He left.

296
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,370
I wonder if he got angry?

297
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,270
There's no doubt that Keiichi ran into a man

298
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,870
that could be the killer.

299
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,270
But, why is he hiding it?

300
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,270
What was he doing outside around 10 am at night

301
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,170
in the first place?

302
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,470
The trace of it having been cut with nippers.

303
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,770
Maybe this is!

304
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,870
What's the matter, Conan?

305
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:21,970
What is it?

306
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,470
Conan?

307
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,870
Just as I thought.

308
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,670
Huh, what is?

309
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,670
Listen.

310
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,770
All these caterpillars were in the olive tree

311
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:34,070
at Keiichi's house to begin with.

312
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,470
What?

313
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,370
Keiichi probably noticed the caterpillars four days ago.

314
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:45,470
Keiichi who found the caterpillars was in a fix.

315
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,170
If he left it as is, the caterpillars would eat up all the leaves

316
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,670
of the olive tree that his mother loved.

317
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,470
But, Keiichi who has a kind heart

318
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,370
could not kill the caterpillars.

319
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,870
Just then Keiichi remembered that there was a large olive tree

320
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,370
on the east side of the same block.

321
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,470
It had dense foliage and looked to have more than enough

322
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,270
even if four caterpillars were to eat them.

323
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,770
So, from that night,

324
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,470
Keiichi started taking one worm at a time everyday

325
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,870
from his house to this house, in order of the large ones first,

326
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,870
after waiting till around 10 pm at night

327
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,670
when there weren't many people around.

328
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,670
He cut the branches with the caterpillars on them with nippers.

329
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,570
If he U-turns,

330
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,170
it would be unnatural if someone were to see him.

331
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,470
So he went to the south, then west

332
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,170
and deliberately took the long way around

333
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,670
"Shimura" -passing in front of the house where the crime occurred.

334
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,770
He went once around and then back to his house.

335
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,470
The caterpillars were moved from the branch

336
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,570
that Keiichi brought to this olive tree.

337
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,570
That's why the olive tree at Keiichi's house

338
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,470
had a few branches cut off,

339
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,570
while there were remains of branches cut with nippers

340
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,170
around this olive tree.

341
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,670
And on the fourth day,

342
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,170
when he finished moving the last caterpillar,

343
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,270
the crime occurred.

344
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:24,070
Keiichi felt guilty about having moved the caterpillars

345
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,170
from his house to someone else's.

346
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:29,670
That's why he denied everything when questioned by the police

347
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,470
and said he didn't go out last night,

348
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,270
the night before or the night before last either.

349
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,470
He went as far as to say what he didn't have to too.

350
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,870
You're fantastic, Conan!

351
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,170
I couldn't help but listen in amazement.

352
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,370
You're just like a real detective.

353
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:46,370
I am a detective.

354
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,070
But, I feel sorry for Keiichi.

355
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,870
I'm sure he's troubled about it.

356
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,070
Yeah, I think we should see Keiichi once more.

357
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,670
Edogawa?

358
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,070
The employee called Yoshikawa disappeared.

359
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,470
What?

360
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,270
According to the other employees he seems to have been

361
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,370
sweeping outside from after noon time right through.

362
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,570
Remember, he was wiping the glass door

363
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,670
when we went too?

364
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,970
Maybe he was looking for a boy

365
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,870
wearing a white cap come home from school.

366
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,470
You mean he was ambushing Keiichi?

367
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,470
But that man's left arm...

368
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:26,370
The culprit didn't hurt his arm when he bumped into Keiichi.

369
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,170
If he did, it should be more on the bottom.

370
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:33,070
Then he was holding his left arm because?

371
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:37,370
It's most likely that the killer was hiding the package

372
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,770
with the money he stole

373
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,170
on the inside of his top and was hiding it under his left arm.

374
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,570
Then, he bumped into Keiichi when he went out,

375
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,370
and he reflexively placed his right hand on his left arm

376
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,570
to keep from dropping the money.

377
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,870
If Yoshikawa is the culprit...

378
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,170
Keiichi is in danger!

379
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,970
Keiichi...

380
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,270
He seems to be out.

381
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,770
Where'd he go?

382
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,870
How would I know?

383
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,370
-Darn! -That rose...

384
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,170
I thought there were more of them.

385
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,070
They've been cut with scissors.

386
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,170
Why would he cut the roses?

387
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,470
Mother used to like them.

388
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:26,870
I see!

389
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:33,770
Mother, I saw the man's face.

390
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,570
Just what am I supposed to do?

391
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,570
So, you did remember my face after all.

392
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,070
Be grateful to me.

393
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,570
I'll let you see your mother.

394
00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:01,770
-Keiichi! -Keiichi!

395
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,970
Keiichi!

396
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,770
Darn!

397
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,870
Take that!

398
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,370
Keiichi!

399
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,270
Keiichi!

400
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,070
I'm okay.

401
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,270
Your cap?

402
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,570
It only stabbed your cap?

403
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,770
-Yep. -I'm glad!

404
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,470
Your mother in heaven saved you.

405
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,070
Yeah!

406
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:23,370
The caterpillars disappeared?

407
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,970
Don't tell me that you got rid of them, mister?

408
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,570
No.

409
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,770
I didn't do anything.

410
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:33,170
They probably dug into the ground to to become pupa.

411
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,170
Pupa?

412
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,870
Oh, I see.

413
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,870
-But what's a pupa? -Seriously?

414
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,570
It'll be next spring

415
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:46,470
when they appear before us again as grown moths.

416
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,770
Yeah.

417
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,570
By the at time,

418
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,970
I hope that my adult form...

419
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,170
will also return.

420
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,238
Next Conan's Hint:

421
00:24:34,238 --> 00:24:36,438
"Stew"

422
00:24:36,438 --> 00:24:37,738
The next episode is about a sad clown.

423
00:24:37,738 --> 00:24:39,338
Clowns are supposed to be funny, aren't they?

424
00:24:39,338 --> 00:24:41,142
Adults have a lot to think about.
