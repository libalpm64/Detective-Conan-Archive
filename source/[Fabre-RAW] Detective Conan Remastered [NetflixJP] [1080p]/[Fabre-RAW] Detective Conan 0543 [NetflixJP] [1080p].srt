1
00:00:03,027 --> 00:00:04,727
On our way home from fishing

2
00:00:04,727 --> 00:00:09,989
when Mr. Subaru came to pick us up instead of Dr. Agasa,

3
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:11,991
we stopped over at the Ikkaku Rock,

4
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:14,327
that is known for the legend of the one-horned dragon.

5
00:00:14,327 --> 00:00:17,427
There, we find the names of fish,

6
00:00:17,427 --> 00:00:21,127
mackerel, carp, sea bream and flatfish carved on the rock,

7
00:00:21,127 --> 00:00:24,003
as well as the dead body of a woman wearing a wet suit.

8
00:00:25,327 --> 00:00:28,007
It looked as if she got messed up in a diving accident

9
00:00:28,227 --> 00:00:29,627
and escaped to the rock,

10
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:31,627
but help failed to come and she died of dehydration.

11
00:00:31,627 --> 00:00:33,527
But, I wasn't deceived.

12
00:00:33,527 --> 00:00:36,015
Even though the woman was wearing lipstick,

13
00:00:36,227 --> 00:00:40,427
there were no signs of any lipstick on the regulator near her.

14
00:00:42,427 --> 00:00:45,127
This is homicide set up to look like an accidental death.

15
00:00:46,327 --> 00:00:47,827
Moreover, we found a diver's watch

16
00:00:47,827 --> 00:00:53,227
that seems to have been used to carve words on the rock.

17
00:00:53,227 --> 00:00:56,527
I noticed that a part of the words in the back was scratched off.

18
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:01,827
The name of the woman who died is Ms. Hikari Akamine.

19
00:01:01,827 --> 00:01:05,127
According to her three male friends that say they're her diving friends,

20
00:01:05,127 --> 00:01:08,727
Hikari seems to have disappeared while diving three days ago.

21
00:01:10,527 --> 00:01:14,053
Who on earth could've left Hikari alone at Ikkaku Rock

22
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:15,627
to dehydrate to death?

23
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,327
And, what's hidden behind the names of fish

24
00:01:19,327 --> 00:01:24,727
mackerel, carp, sea bream, and flatfish?

25
00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:29,427
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

26
00:01:29,427 --> 00:01:31,827
Saturday nights are for mystery.

27
00:01:31,827 --> 00:01:36,075
Fish messages left behind on a Dragon legend rock.

28
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:37,627
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:37,627 --> 00:01:39,327
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:39,327 --> 00:01:41,427
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

31
00:03:22,758 --> 00:03:27,958
"The Ikkau Rock Where Fish Disappear (Part 2)"

32
00:03:29,558 --> 00:03:33,558
That's what she gets for being reckless when she can't even swim.

33
00:03:33,558 --> 00:03:35,758
She couldn't swim and yet she went diving?

34
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:39,158
Yes, there are a lot of divers who can't swim.

35
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:42,858
Because we can use fins and breathe using a tank.

36
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:47,758
By the way, what's your relationship with Hikari?

37
00:03:47,758 --> 00:03:50,209
We're just her diving friends.

38
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:53,758
In the beginning, only we were diving together

39
00:03:53,758 --> 00:03:56,658
"Rokusuke Oto (23)" -but Hikari said she wanted to join us,

40
00:03:56,658 --> 00:03:59,258
so we started diving together.

41
00:03:59,258 --> 00:04:02,221
"Shuhei Aosato (25)" -Using her cruiser,

42
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:04,223
we could dive at any diving point we wanted too.

43
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,858
"Yasuji Kaida (24)" -With her around,

44
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:09,258
we got to eat gorgeous gourmet dishes too.

45
00:04:09,258 --> 00:04:15,958
But, don't people usual scuba dive in pairs of two?

46
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:19,058
How did you lose track of Hikari?

47
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:22,241
Hikari swims of ahead of us on her own,

48
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:26,245
saying things like she wants to be alone when in the water.

49
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:27,158
A half a month ago,

50
00:04:27,158 --> 00:04:29,558
because of that she was taken in by the current

51
00:04:29,558 --> 00:04:31,658
and had the fright of her life.

52
00:04:31,658 --> 00:04:32,758
Yes.

53
00:04:32,758 --> 00:04:34,558
If that didn't happen,

54
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:37,258
Yoshiro wouldn't be dead.

55
00:04:39,258 --> 00:04:41,258
Yoshiro?

56
00:04:41,258 --> 00:04:42,258
Oh, well...

57
00:04:42,258 --> 00:04:43,358
Don't talk about Yoshiro.

58
00:04:43,358 --> 00:04:45,858
It has nothing to do with what we're talking about now.

59
00:04:47,658 --> 00:04:50,269
By the way, Mr. Kaida.

60
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:53,158
What happened to your eye?

61
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:57,058
Last night, he punched me

62
00:04:57,058 --> 00:04:59,858
when I said that Hikari's probably in bed

63
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:01,158
at some man's place,

64
00:05:01,158 --> 00:05:03,358
so to just leave her as she is.

65
00:05:03,358 --> 00:05:06,858
He got angry saying what if the worst happens.

66
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:10,289
Then what about the mask you're wearing Mr. Oto?

67
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:11,758
Hikari forced me to go diving

68
00:05:11,758 --> 00:05:14,058
when I wasn't feeling all that well...

69
00:05:16,658 --> 00:05:19,658
so I caught a cold and it's taking me forever to recover.

70
00:05:19,658 --> 00:05:23,758
Oh, but I'm diving without worrying about a thing now, though.

71
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:24,958
Mr. Aosato.

72
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,858
Under your lip... did you hurt yourself?

73
00:05:27,858 --> 00:05:29,458
Pimples.

74
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,311
Last night when I was net surfing at an internet cafe

75
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:33,758
and was holding my head in my hands,

76
00:05:33,758 --> 00:05:35,558
I burst a pimple.

77
00:05:36,758 --> 00:05:39,058
What were you net surfing for?

78
00:05:39,058 --> 00:05:42,321
What else but information on Hikari?

79
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:45,458
I was checking to see if there were any young guys who saw her at sea

80
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,327
and picked her up or something even if the chances were really slight...

81
00:05:48,558 --> 00:05:50,658
I was checking blogs on the subject.

82
00:05:50,658 --> 00:05:53,158
Hey, you guys.

83
00:05:53,158 --> 00:05:55,458
What kind of fish do you like?

84
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:58,658
Please answer one by one.

85
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:02,341
Tell us! I like eels!

86
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:05,358
What's with these kids?

87
00:06:05,358 --> 00:06:07,058
Well, you see...

88
00:06:07,058 --> 00:06:09,758
Hey! What's with you guys blurting out

89
00:06:09,758 --> 00:06:11,858
something weird like that out of the blue?

90
00:06:11,858 --> 00:06:13,658
It's not weird!

91
00:06:13,658 --> 00:06:17,658
That dying message of sea bream and flatfish.

92
00:06:17,658 --> 00:06:23,158
They could be the names of the fish that the culprit liked.

93
00:06:23,158 --> 00:06:24,363
Don't be ridiculous.

94
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:28,367
No, they've got a point.

95
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:33,358
It's not unusual that an innocent idea not bound by common sense

96
00:06:33,358 --> 00:06:37,358
will serve as a key to revealing the truth.

97
00:06:37,358 --> 00:06:40,658
Isn't that how you solved many cases,

98
00:06:40,658 --> 00:06:43,758
using the words of this boy as a clue?

99
00:06:43,758 --> 00:06:47,858
Well... I wouldn't say that many, but...

100
00:06:47,858 --> 00:06:51,858
Hey, do you guys have fish that you like a lot?

101
00:06:51,858 --> 00:06:55,358
All three of us love fish.

102
00:06:55,358 --> 00:06:57,758
We don't have any particular fish we don't like either.

103
00:06:57,758 --> 00:06:59,058
So they say.

104
00:07:01,058 --> 00:07:05,058
Hey, hey, just how long to plan to stay here?

105
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:08,407
Right, the sun'll go down soon too.

106
00:07:08,658 --> 00:07:15,158
You all have the same diver's watch as Hikari's.

107
00:07:15,158 --> 00:07:16,858
Yes.

108
00:07:16,858 --> 00:07:19,858
Hikari made it for us.

109
00:07:19,858 --> 00:07:24,423
She wanted us to all have something in common as a diving team.

110
00:07:24,658 --> 00:07:28,427
She carved the name Akamine Angel Fish Club on the watch.

111
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:32,158
Angel fish?

112
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:37,458
I'll hear you out at the station.

113
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,439
I want to hear if you have anything will lead to the culprit too.

114
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,558
Culprit...

115
00:07:41,558 --> 00:07:44,443
You mean this is not an accident?

116
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:47,458
Right. There's a killer

117
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:51,058
and most probably among the three here.

118
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:52,858
But, what can it be?

119
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:54,758
The dying message having to do with fish

120
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:58,258
mackerel, carp, sea bream, flatfish.

121
00:07:58,258 --> 00:08:00,459
What on earth does it mean?

122
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:04,463
Besides the word on the diver's watch that was scratched out...

123
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:06,465
Why only the word fish?

124
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:07,558
I get it.

125
00:08:07,558 --> 00:08:10,758
The name of fish.

126
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:13,258
If you add words to it and connect it,

127
00:08:13,258 --> 00:08:15,058
it'll form a phrase.

128
00:08:15,058 --> 00:08:16,158
Add?

129
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:17,958
If you add "ku" to "saba" (mackerel),

130
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,058
it makes the word "sabaku" meaning desert!

131
00:08:19,058 --> 00:08:20,479
Add "ai" to "tai" (sea bream),

132
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,958
it makes the phrase, "I want to see you."

133
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:25,158
In other words, the message is,

134
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:28,487
"I want to see you so come to the desert!"

135
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:30,758
Then what about flatfish?

136
00:08:30,758 --> 00:08:32,491
It means to be inspired,

137
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:36,495
(hirameke-flatfish+ke) of this reading the message.

138
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:41,258
But who's going to wait for who at the desert?

139
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:44,058
That woman's dead.

140
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:46,505
Right.

141
00:08:46,758 --> 00:08:49,858
Besides, so conveniently adding certain letters

142
00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:51,858
to words and connecting them forcibly to make phrases,

143
00:08:51,858 --> 00:08:54,058
I don't think leads to solving anything.

144
00:08:54,058 --> 00:08:56,515
Whether letters are added or removed,

145
00:08:56,758 --> 00:08:57,858
there's got to be a key word

146
00:08:57,858 --> 00:08:59,358
that serves as a hint as to what should be done.

147
00:09:01,658 --> 00:09:03,458
Great work, you guys!

148
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:05,758
What?

149
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:08,527
So, you can't make light of innocent remarks after all.

150
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,558
Don't tell me you...

151
00:09:11,558 --> 00:09:12,531
Figured out the culprit?

152
00:09:12,758 --> 00:09:16,158
Yes, thanks to all of you.

153
00:09:16,158 --> 00:09:18,058
What do you mean?

154
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,958
The culprit was telling us who he was to begin with.

155
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:27,058
That he was the one who left Hikari back at Ikkaku Rock

156
00:09:27,058 --> 00:09:29,358
and killed her.

157
00:09:29,358 --> 00:09:33,158
Hey, hey, the sun's really going to set if you don't hurry.

158
00:09:33,158 --> 00:09:38,258
Don't you think we should take Hikari's body to land as soon as possible?

159
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:40,559
If you still have something you want to ask us,

160
00:09:40,758 --> 00:09:43,158
you can do so to your heart's content back at the station.

161
00:09:43,158 --> 00:09:45,158
Okay, carry her body onto the boat...

162
00:09:45,158 --> 00:09:46,358
-Wait a second! -Wait a second!

163
00:09:48,058 --> 00:09:50,569
What, both of you?

164
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:53,558
Well... this boy wants to talk to you.

165
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:57,658
But if you have something you want to say, you can go ahead, Subaru.

166
00:09:57,658 --> 00:10:02,581
So, I'll hear everyone out to their heart's content back at the station.

167
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:04,858
But, then...

168
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:10,058
All proof that is here will be hidden.

169
00:10:10,058 --> 00:10:11,458
Isn't that right?

170
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:12,591
Sort of.

171
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:16,158
Proof? What proof are you talking about?

172
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:20,358
Can't you tell?

173
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:22,601
Of course, it's proof of the culprit

174
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:27,058
who left that woman back here at Ikkaku Rock

175
00:10:27,058 --> 00:10:29,558
leaving her to dehydrate to dehydrate to death.

176
00:10:29,558 --> 00:10:30,609
Hey, hey.

177
00:10:30,858 --> 00:10:33,458
Hiding proof means... Don't tell me that...

178
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,615
Yes, he's probably here.

179
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:39,558
The culprit is among one of us.

180
00:10:39,558 --> 00:10:41,058
Wait up!

181
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:43,458
How do you know something like that?

182
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,558
It's true that Hikari disappeared

183
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:49,858
while she was diving with us three days ago but...

184
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,158
It could be that she was picked up

185
00:10:51,158 --> 00:10:55,958
by some bad guy and was left behind here!

186
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,637
No, that's close to impossible.

187
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:02,358
You said when Hikari disappeared

188
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:03,658
that you received text mail from her saying,

189
00:11:03,658 --> 00:11:05,858
"I'll leave the rest to you guy", right?

190
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:11,258
That's proof that the culprit is among you.

191
00:11:11,258 --> 00:11:12,651
I think that the culprit sent that mail

192
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:16,658
so that you wouldn't go out to search for Hikari right away

193
00:11:16,658 --> 00:11:18,658
after he left her behind at the site.

194
00:11:18,658 --> 00:11:21,358
In order to do so, he had to come on board the boat

195
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:23,158
from diving earlier than everyone else

196
00:11:23,158 --> 00:11:25,158
look for Hikari's cell phone,

197
00:11:25,158 --> 00:11:29,058
"I'll leave the rest to you guy" -and send the mail out.

198
00:11:29,058 --> 00:11:30,358
"Sent"

199
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,671
Unlike the phone, the address remains

200
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:34,358
when you mail something out.

201
00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:37,258
So, it had to be sent using Hikari's address

202
00:11:37,258 --> 00:11:38,958
to avoid being suspected.

203
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,258
I see, so the only ones who could've sent the mail

204
00:11:42,258 --> 00:11:45,358
are the ones who knew

205
00:11:45,358 --> 00:11:47,858
that it wouldn't be strange for her to be sending you mail.

206
00:11:47,858 --> 00:11:49,258
But...

207
00:11:49,258 --> 00:11:52,691
where's Hikari's cell phone that you're talking about?

208
00:11:52,858 --> 00:11:56,458
Well, if it were me, after I send the mail

209
00:11:56,458 --> 00:12:00,358
I would dispose of it in this vast sea.

210
00:12:00,358 --> 00:12:03,158
Then, there is no proof.

211
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:04,703
Not so.

212
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:09,858
Not only proof, Hikari left us the name of the culprit.

213
00:12:09,858 --> 00:12:12,711
Isn't that right,

214
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:15,458
Mr. Shuhei Aosato?

215
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,400
Hey, cut out that weird talk.

216
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,600
It's like you're saying that I'm the one who did it.

217
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,500
Besides, how did you know that his name is Shuhei, kid?

218
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,000
We only gave you our last names.

219
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Hikari carved the name of the culprit on the Ikkaku Rock,

220
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,751
that's why I know. Your full name Shuhei Aosato.

221
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,100
Where is something like that written?

222
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,400
Carved? You mean the name of fish?

223
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,761
But, the only names written were mackerel,

224
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,763
carp, sea bream and flatfish?

225
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:06,500
It's true if you look at only that

226
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,100
it looks like the names of fish are carved but...

227
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,200
If you take into consideration

228
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,200
the word that was scratched out in back of Hikari's diver's watch,

229
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,100
it comes to light, doesn't it?

230
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,000
Was something scratched out?

231
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,600
Yes. The word in between "Akamine Angel" and "club" were...

232
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,500
Akamine Angel Fish Club.

233
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,400
The word that was scratched out was fish.

234
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,500
In other words,

235
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,400
she wanted you to scratch out the word fish.

236
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,800
-Yes. -Wait, please.

237
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,200
The word fish?

238
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,400
Mackerel, carp, sea bream and flatfish are all fish!

239
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,700
If you scratch out fish, they'll all disappear.

240
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,300
I get it, kanji characters.

241
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,200
You change the names of the fish into kanji characters

242
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,400
and cross out the fish part of it.

243
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,500
Kanji?

244
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,000
Is there a kanji character for mackerel?

245
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,400
Yes, you write the word "fish" to the left of the kanji

246
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,000
and "Ao" to the right making the word mackerel.

247
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,600
"Fish" on the left and "Sato" to the right, carp.

248
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,100
"Fish" to the left and "Shuu" to the right, sea bream.

249
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:26,845
And to the left and "Hei" to the right makes flatfish.

250
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:31,200
If you remove the "fish" part from all the kanji characters...

251
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,851
Ao.

252
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:34,853
Sato.

253
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:37,200
Shu.

254
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,300
Hei.

255
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,200
"Aosato Shuhei"

256
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,100
-Aosato Shuhei! -Aosato Shuhei!

257
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,000
-Hey! -You...

258
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,867
No way. Don't take them seriously.

259
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,500
No one's going to make a culprit out of me

260
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,600
using such a riddle like reason.

261
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,300
But...

262
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,700
It seems pretty logical to me.

263
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,300
But, if I'm the culprit

264
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,500
all she had to do was write my name as is, right?

265
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,500
She probably thought that you'd erase it if she did.

266
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,500
You know, when you come back here to confirm if she died.

267
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,895
What're you talking about?

268
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:20,100
Did you see me come here or what?

269
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,100
No, we didn't.

270
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:27,200
But, we know the other reason why you came here today, Mr. Aosato.

271
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,300
What?

272
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,909
To switch the regulator.

273
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,800
You probably slashed the pipe of Hikari's regulator with a knife

274
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,100
and after faking an air leak brought her here to Ikkaku Rock

275
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,300
lied to her saying that you'd be coming back to get her

276
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,300
and left her behind like you did, right?

277
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,300
People don't come to Ikkaku Rock

278
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,500
and since Hikari can't swim you figured she couldn't escape.

279
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,000
In other words, you came to switch

280
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,200
that slashed regulator with your own.

281
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,000
If the slash is found later,

282
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
the case would not be handled as an accident.

283
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,945
If you close off the slash with a vinyl tape or something,

284
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:09,600
you can make it back with that regulator.

285
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,951
So, I'm asking if you guys saw me do that?

286
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:14,700
The band-aid by your lip...

287
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,957
You said that you busted a pimple

288
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:20,959
while you were net surfing at an internet cafe

289
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,000
with your head in your hands, right?

290
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,965
Most of the mouse in internet cafes are for right-handed people.

291
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,700
Which means that you were holding your head with your left hand

292
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,973
so the busted pimple should naturally be below your left chin.

293
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,600
But, judging from the position of the bandage...

294
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
The Band-Aid is not under your left side, is it?

295
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,500
It got smeared on, didn't it?

296
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,400
When you went back to the boat to switch regulators

297
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,900
with Hikari's and put it in your mouth?

298
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,987
Oh, no...

299
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:52,991
Hikari's lipstick.

300
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:58,400
I see. When you got on board and wiped your mouth

301
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,600
you realized for the first time that lipstick was smeared on you.

302
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,100
So, you hid the lipstick that smeared under your right lip

303
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,999
by using Band-Aid, right?

304
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:10,700
Lipstick doesn't come off that easily

305
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,600
just by wiping it off with your hand.

306
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,300
But, she sure is a strange diver.

307
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,100
I mean if she was a beginner I can see,

308
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,999
but, she's been diving for some time,

309
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:22,800
and yet why did she dive without removing her lipstick?

310
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,400
She did so deliberately.

311
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,025
When she first started diving,

312
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:30,400
I mistakenly used her regulator and got lipstick smeared on me.

313
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,500
She thought that was funny,

314
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,035
so she continued to keep her lipstick on when diving.

315
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,039
Well... thanks to that,

316
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,043
we found out that Hikari left Yoshiro to die.

317
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,700
Left him to die?

318
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,800
Do you remember the accident 6 months ago?

319
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:57,055
Yes, you mean when Hikari was taken by the current at the lake

320
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:59,500
and Yoshiro went to save her.

321
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,900
We somehow managed to find Hikari

322
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,000
and pull her up to the boat but...

323
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,300
Yoshiro was dead a while later.

324
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,300
Hey, don't tell me that Yoshiro was near Hikari back then too?

325
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,800
Yes, it's likely.

326
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,000
But, that isn't what she said back then.

327
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:22,700
I'm alone. Sorry and let me on board.

328
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,083
It's so cold I'll freeze to death.

329
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,085
So, we all thought...

330
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,500
She didn't see Yoshiro.

331
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,100
Of course, she saw him,

332
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,700
because on the Yoshiro's rescue regulator that was found later.

333
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,600
Hikari's lipstick was smeared all over it.

334
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,500
When I pushed her for an answer,

335
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,103
she said that she thought that Yoshiro

336
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:48,000
had already swum back to land but...

337
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,200
Isn't it natural to ask right away?

338
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,100
About Yoshiro who came to rescue her

339
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,700
and got caught in the current again, wondering if he's okay.

340
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,600
All she was concerned about was getting back on land

341
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,600
and jumping into a warm bed!

342
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,000
She could care less if Yoshiro lived or died!

343
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,800
That's why I left that woman behind at Ikkaku Rock here.

344
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,100
Well...

345
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,500
You're all going to experience the same thing!

346
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,100
Shuhei, don't be stupid!

347
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,600
Don't worry.

348
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,800
I'm just going to buy time until I get out of here.

349
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,151
You guys are staying here for a while.

350
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,153
Hey, officer!

351
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:37,700
Tell your men on board the boat,

352
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,159
that you're returning on my cruiser while listening to my story,

353
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,800
so to go on back without you.

354
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,165
And when the police boat is out of sight...

355
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:48,900
Fisherman!

356
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:54,700
Cut the rope that is tied to the rock and let it go.

357
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,175
When the fishing boat is out of sight,

358
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:59,177
I'm taking this child

359
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:02,300
and getting out of here with the cruiser!

360
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,400
Darn. My watch type tranquilizer gun's on the boat.

361
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,000
Although it's a bit dangerous

362
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,900
I'll use my super kick shoe.

363
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm wearing boots.

364
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,900
Hey, Ai, don't you have anything that may serve as a weapon?

365
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,600
What makes you think I'd have something so convenient on me.

366
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:29,900
0.12 percent...

367
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,209
What?

368
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:35,213
That's the rate that a culprit makes a safe escape.

369
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:37,600
It's one in a thousand people.

370
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,300
But, those few who have received the blessing of the devil

371
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,223
and fled will eventually tire from hiding their true identities,

372
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,200
living in fear and continue living on.

373
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,900
Putting aside those who have confessed

374
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,600
to their crime or committed suicide,

375
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,600
the success rated is virtually...

376
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,700
nil.

377
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,600
Will you be able to endure being all alone

378
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,243
as well as the pressure of all that is to come?

379
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,245
Shut up!

380
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,700
Okay, you're fine now.

381
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,800
Thank you.

382
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,900
Well, then, shall we have you flee all the way to the station?

383
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,800
Yes, sir.

384
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:41,300
You're sure strong!

385
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,281
Really awesome!

386
00:21:43,281 --> 00:21:44,400
Not really...

387
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,000
Thank you, Subaru.

388
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,600
Is what you said about 0.12 percent really true?

389
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,293
Of course, it's a lie.

390
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,700
I thought I had no choice

391
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,600
but to provoke him if I wanted him to divert

392
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,000
the knife away from her.

393
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,900
You're really something after all.

394
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,800
Just as I thought. He's...

395
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

396
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,423
"Crayon".

397
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,744
Shin, your name is Shinichi, isn't it?

398
00:24:08,744 --> 00:24:10,800
You can't say it with that kind of timing.
