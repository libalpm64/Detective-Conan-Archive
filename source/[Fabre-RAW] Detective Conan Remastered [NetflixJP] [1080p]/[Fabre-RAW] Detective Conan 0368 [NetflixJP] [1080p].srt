1
00:00:22,196 --> 00:00:23,996
Today's stage is set at a candy house.

2
00:00:23,996 --> 00:00:25,696
The trick is a sugary, sweet, simple trap.

3
00:00:25,696 --> 00:00:27,796
Once you get in, there's no way out.

4
00:00:27,796 --> 00:00:29,296
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:31,096
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,096 --> 00:00:32,996
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:04,216 --> 00:02:08,316
It only costs 500 yen to get in to the museum.

8
00:02:08,316 --> 00:02:11,716
And what's more surprising is you can eat Ecriture's cake at half price!

9
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:13,216
You going to regret it for the rest of your life

10
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:16,016
if you miss this opportunity!

11
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:19,816
Wait, Sonoko! The cake isn't gonna run away!

12
00:02:19,816 --> 00:02:21,716
Well, I want to run away.

13
00:02:23,216 --> 00:02:24,516
Here! It's here!

14
00:02:24,516 --> 00:02:27,616
"Ecriture"

15
00:02:27,616 --> 00:02:29,716
Now, let's go! Ran!

16
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,116
Sonoko.

17
00:02:32,116 --> 00:02:34,816
Come on, Ran! And you too, kid!

18
00:02:34,816 --> 00:02:36,616
Now, hurry up...

19
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:43,516
Isn't it just like the candy house in "Hansel and Gretel"?

20
00:02:45,716 --> 00:02:48,116
It's all made of cake and candies?

21
00:02:48,116 --> 00:02:50,216
I can't believe it!

22
00:02:50,216 --> 00:02:52,916
Look how many sweets are here.

23
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:53,916
All right!

24
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,416
Now, the morning part begins!

25
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,916
What do you mean "the morning part"?

26
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,316
Ran, do you know?

27
00:03:01,316 --> 00:03:04,216
This event is has two parts, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.

28
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:06,516
I guess Sonoko wants to eat now,

29
00:03:06,516 --> 00:03:08,716
just to get her stomach ready for the afternoon.

30
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:13,016
No way. I really want to go home.

31
00:03:15,116 --> 00:03:20,416
"The Witch in a Candy House"

32
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:24,416
So each patissier has his own booth?

33
00:03:25,516 --> 00:03:27,716
Which one I should start off with?

34
00:03:27,716 --> 00:03:30,416
The person in this photo...

35
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:31,616
Isn't he that man over there.

36
00:04:15,316 --> 00:04:16,416
My god.

37
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:19,316
How can he make three cakes at the same time?

38
00:04:20,516 --> 00:04:24,516
"Tsuyoshi Maeda (28), Patissier"

39
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:26,716
This is like fighting rather than cooking.

40
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:28,616
Oh, you didn't know?

41
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:32,316
He is actually called Fighting Patissier by people.

42
00:04:32,316 --> 00:04:34,716
So he is the one in the "Iron Patissier"?

43
00:04:34,716 --> 00:04:38,516
Right. The patissier in the middle with the elegant move

44
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:40,916
"Yasou Fujino (30)" -is the Prince of Sweets.

45
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,716
See the patissier in the back?

46
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:45,016
She makes candies just like magic,

47
00:04:45,016 --> 00:04:47,016
"Yumi Morimoto (26)" -so people call her Candy Magician.

48
00:05:05,616 --> 00:05:07,216
He is like an idol.

49
00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:10,616
Would you like to make one?

50
00:05:10,616 --> 00:05:13,216
What? Me?

51
00:05:13,216 --> 00:05:17,616
Yes...

52
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:20,316
Come on. I will help you.

53
00:05:20,316 --> 00:05:22,516
It sounds fun. Do it, Conan.

54
00:05:22,516 --> 00:05:24,016
No, I'm okay.

55
00:05:24,016 --> 00:05:25,916
Here...

56
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,716
Yes...

57
00:05:27,716 --> 00:05:30,116
-Don't worry. It's simple. -Excuse me!

58
00:05:30,116 --> 00:05:32,416
-No. Ran, why don't you try? -Yes...

59
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,516
Yes.

60
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:35,216
-Me? No, I'm okay. -Yes...

61
00:05:35,216 --> 00:05:38,316
It's not like we came here everyday. You go ahead and do it.

62
00:05:38,316 --> 00:05:40,216
It's the last part.

63
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:41,816
Everybody can do it.

64
00:05:41,816 --> 00:05:44,116
I will give you this one after it's done.

65
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:51,716
All you need to do is put the chocolate cream on the roll cake.

66
00:05:51,716 --> 00:05:53,916
Make it thick.

67
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:57,416
Then, make tree patterns with this fork.

68
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:58,516
Now, try it.

69
00:05:58,516 --> 00:05:59,716
With a fork?

70
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:11,016
If you want to be popular with girls these days,

71
00:06:11,016 --> 00:06:12,416
you gotta learn to make cake

72
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,816
I think that's pretty good.

73
00:06:19,816 --> 00:06:21,316
Right, Sonoko?

74
00:06:21,316 --> 00:06:24,116
I guess so.

75
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:25,316
She's still upset.

76
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,516
I will finish the rest so I can give this to you.

77
00:06:29,516 --> 00:06:31,516
Are you going to stay here for the afternoon too?

78
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,516
Oh, yes! Of course! Right?

79
00:06:34,516 --> 00:06:35,616
Yes.

80
00:06:37,016 --> 00:06:41,016
These candies look so alive, right?

81
00:06:50,116 --> 00:06:53,116
As expected of the Candy Magician.

82
00:06:53,116 --> 00:06:55,516
Looks like glass art, isn't it?

83
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:57,216
Thank you!

84
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:00,016
This kind of invisible feel is the real magic behind the taste.

85
00:07:00,016 --> 00:07:01,116
Here you go!

86
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,916
Pretty candy tastes better.

87
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:11,516
It's my dream to win a contest with these candies someday.

88
00:07:15,716 --> 00:07:18,516
Miss, this is tasty!

89
00:07:18,516 --> 00:07:19,816
Thank you!

90
00:07:21,016 --> 00:07:23,616
I don't know which to choose.

91
00:07:23,616 --> 00:07:24,916
What are you talking about?

92
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,016
It's simple. Eat them all.

93
00:07:27,016 --> 00:07:28,116
All of it?

94
00:07:33,116 --> 00:07:35,816
Here! Hold this, will you?

95
00:07:35,816 --> 00:07:38,916
We'll have this first.

96
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:42,616
This one too.

97
00:07:42,616 --> 00:07:43,716
This one.

98
00:07:43,716 --> 00:07:48,216
And this one...

99
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:50,316
You want me to get something for you too, kid?

100
00:07:50,316 --> 00:07:53,116
No. I'm okay!

101
00:07:53,116 --> 00:07:55,916
I will get it myself.

102
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,216
Okay.

103
00:07:57,216 --> 00:07:59,116
Then, I'm gonna get some more.

104
00:08:01,316 --> 00:08:03,016
Dangerous...

105
00:08:08,116 --> 00:08:09,616
Are you ok?

106
00:08:11,016 --> 00:08:13,816
"Sachiko Hashigaki (45)" -I'm sorry!

107
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,316
I'm so sorry.

108
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:21,116
I just ruined your cake.

109
00:08:21,116 --> 00:08:23,216
Doesn't matter as long as it tastes good.

110
00:08:23,216 --> 00:08:24,216
Well, it does matter.

111
00:08:24,216 --> 00:08:27,016
How it looks and how it's made.

112
00:08:27,016 --> 00:08:29,516
Looks really matter when it comes to today's sweets.

113
00:08:33,716 --> 00:08:35,916
You can eat everything.

114
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,816
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

115
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,716
Hey, Maeda.

116
00:08:48,716 --> 00:08:51,116
Why can't you act more sociable?

117
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:53,916
Why don't you learn something from Fujino?

118
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,616
If greeting people can make things taste better,

119
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:58,016
I'll do that as much as you want me to.

120
00:09:02,616 --> 00:09:04,916
Hold on. You're still able to eat?

121
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,016
Of course.

122
00:09:06,016 --> 00:09:08,616
Conan. What took you so long to pick your cake?

123
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:09,716
Ah, well...

124
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:10,816
All right!

125
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,016
I'm ready for the second round!

126
00:09:15,116 --> 00:09:17,616
Well, I'm getting thirsty.

127
00:09:17,616 --> 00:09:19,616
I'll get something to drink.

128
00:09:19,616 --> 00:09:21,916
-I'll go with you, Conan. -Okay.

129
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,216
Then can you get me one too, please?

130
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,816
No sweets for a while, seriously.

131
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:31,316
Shinichi would say something like,

132
00:09:31,316 --> 00:09:35,516
"What have you been eating while I was away?"

133
00:09:35,516 --> 00:09:37,716
I wouldn't say anything like that.

134
00:09:37,716 --> 00:09:39,416
Why would I?

135
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:44,516
I'm a chef and not a magician!

136
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:48,016
That's the way it is because that's what the customers want.

137
00:09:48,016 --> 00:09:50,016
Please judge it based on taste!

138
00:09:50,016 --> 00:09:51,116
You're so naive.

139
00:09:51,116 --> 00:09:53,716
Do you know how many fantastic sweets exist in this world?

140
00:09:53,716 --> 00:09:56,516
Cake and chocolates are dominating the sweets scene,

141
00:09:56,516 --> 00:10:00,316
but your candies have got really popular because of my marketing skills,

142
00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:01,816
and not because of how they taste!

143
00:10:11,316 --> 00:10:12,616
When I came here yesterday,

144
00:10:12,616 --> 00:10:15,716
there was no "Wood Chocolate Cake making trial".

145
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:17,716
You're so lucky!

146
00:10:17,716 --> 00:10:20,116
What? You came here yesterday too?

147
00:10:20,116 --> 00:10:22,116
No wonder you know so much about this place!

148
00:10:22,116 --> 00:10:24,116
There you are.

149
00:10:24,116 --> 00:10:25,616
I've been looking for you.

150
00:10:25,616 --> 00:10:26,716
Here!

151
00:10:26,716 --> 00:10:29,016
You know, it's the Wood Chocolate Cake you made.

152
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:30,216
How is it?

153
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:36,216
It's been nicely fixed.

154
00:10:36,216 --> 00:10:37,616
Without the decorations,

155
00:10:37,616 --> 00:10:40,116
it's just the same as the one in the store, isn't it?

156
00:10:40,116 --> 00:10:41,416
It looks so delicious!

157
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,516
Oh my God.

158
00:11:18,104 --> 00:11:21,904
"Ecriture" -The morning part of the event was finished past 12 pm.

159
00:11:21,904 --> 00:11:25,004
And the dead body was found around 12:30 pm.

160
00:11:25,004 --> 00:11:27,604
And where were you guys during that time?

161
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,704
I was in the kitchen making candies for the afternoon.

162
00:11:29,704 --> 00:11:33,504
I was there alone since I let the cashiers out for lunch.

163
00:11:33,504 --> 00:11:37,104
I went out to give them a cake after I was done with it.

164
00:11:39,204 --> 00:11:41,004
Okay. So, you saw Ms. Hashigaki.

165
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:43,304
What was she doing?

166
00:11:43,304 --> 00:11:45,804
She was doing some counting work.

167
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:49,504
She was working hard so I didn't talk to her.

168
00:11:49,504 --> 00:11:52,604
Mr. Fujino left the kitchen to give a cake to Conan.

169
00:11:52,604 --> 00:11:54,104
During this short period,

170
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:56,704
the suspect murdered Ms. Hashigaki.

171
00:11:56,704 --> 00:11:59,604
Mr. Maeda, you were outside the candy house too, right?

172
00:11:59,604 --> 00:12:02,804
I was in the office from 12:25 pm to 12:35 pm

173
00:12:02,804 --> 00:12:06,604
since I was told that somebody was on the phone, waiting for me.

174
00:12:06,604 --> 00:12:09,304
You seem to remember the time precisely.

175
00:12:09,304 --> 00:12:11,204
Well, it's because...

176
00:12:11,204 --> 00:12:14,704
I have a habit to keep my eyes on the watch when I do something.

177
00:12:14,704 --> 00:12:16,804
You know, because we use stuff like the oven.

178
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:19,204
Who else was in the office?

179
00:12:19,204 --> 00:12:20,304
Only myself.

180
00:12:20,304 --> 00:12:22,604
The other staff were out to lunch, I think.

181
00:12:22,604 --> 00:12:23,904
I see.

182
00:12:23,904 --> 00:12:26,204
So, after Mr. Fujino left this place,

183
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,604
somebody murdered Ms. Hashigaki,

184
00:12:28,604 --> 00:12:31,204
and Mr. Maeda found the dead body when he came back from the office.

185
00:12:31,204 --> 00:12:33,204
-Am I right? -Yes.

186
00:12:33,204 --> 00:12:36,304
Ms. Morimoto, you were the only one here.

187
00:12:36,304 --> 00:12:39,804
Didn't you notice anybody coming in?

188
00:12:39,804 --> 00:12:40,904
No.

189
00:12:40,904 --> 00:12:43,804
The back of the victim's head was severely injured.

190
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:47,104
There could be a murder weapon inside the museum.

191
00:12:47,104 --> 00:12:49,404
Search throughout the museum!

192
00:12:49,404 --> 00:12:51,204
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

193
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:54,504
One of the chefs must have killed Ms. Hashigaki.

194
00:12:54,504 --> 00:12:55,804
Then, the type of the weapon

195
00:12:55,804 --> 00:12:58,804
and how it was disposed would be the key to finding the suspect.

196
00:12:58,804 --> 00:13:03,104
I think either Maeda or Fujino must have killed Ms. Hashigaki.

197
00:13:03,104 --> 00:13:04,304
-What are you talking about? -What are you talking about?

198
00:13:06,104 --> 00:13:07,604
Yeah, it has to be!

199
00:13:07,604 --> 00:13:10,404
Maeda owed her a lot of money

200
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:11,804
and Fujino wanted to go independent.

201
00:13:11,804 --> 00:13:13,504
So you two were having trouble with her.

202
00:13:13,504 --> 00:13:16,004
Everyone in the store knew about it.

203
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,004
Well, we aren't the only ones

204
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,604
who were having trouble with her, were we?

205
00:13:19,604 --> 00:13:21,904
What do you mean?

206
00:13:21,904 --> 00:13:24,104
She wanted to quit the candy-making performance,

207
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:27,304
because she was too confident in the taste of her candies.

208
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:29,704
You were having an argument with her

209
00:13:29,704 --> 00:13:31,204
right before she was murdered, weren't you?

210
00:13:31,204 --> 00:13:32,904
I heard your voice all the way across the hall.

211
00:13:34,004 --> 00:13:39,004
It's true that Ms. Morimoto was having an argument with Ms. Hashigaki.

212
00:13:39,004 --> 00:13:41,604
Please judge it based on the taste!

213
00:13:41,604 --> 00:13:45,904
It's possible that Ms. Morimoto, who was left alone, murdered her.

214
00:13:45,904 --> 00:13:48,304
Each kitchen is divided with partitions,

215
00:13:48,304 --> 00:13:50,604
so nobody can see Ms. Morimoto from here.

216
00:13:52,004 --> 00:13:54,304
The big tree gets in the way.

217
00:13:54,304 --> 00:13:56,604
So, nobody can see what's going on here from Ms. Morimoto's kitchen.

218
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,504
That means...

219
00:14:01,204 --> 00:14:06,404
the other two chefs could've murdered Ms. Hashigaki as well.

220
00:14:06,404 --> 00:14:09,104
You left here right after I left, right?

221
00:14:09,104 --> 00:14:12,304
Don't you think it took too long just to find the kid?

222
00:14:12,304 --> 00:14:14,004
The east space is huge.

223
00:14:14,004 --> 00:14:16,504
It's not easy to find a person there.

224
00:14:16,504 --> 00:14:20,104
Don't you think it was too good timing that you got a phone call?

225
00:14:20,104 --> 00:14:22,804
The phone was already cut when I answered the phone.

226
00:14:22,804 --> 00:14:25,204
This has to be be a setup!

227
00:14:25,204 --> 00:14:27,604
You could've been the one who called

228
00:14:27,604 --> 00:14:30,204
and told yourself to come to the office.

229
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:31,304
What?

230
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,004
We'll find out who killed Ms. Hashigaki

231
00:14:33,004 --> 00:14:35,304
when we find the weapon!

232
00:14:35,304 --> 00:14:38,204
Just to let you know, you are the one

233
00:14:38,204 --> 00:14:39,604
who could kill Ms. Hashigaki the easiest.

234
00:14:39,604 --> 00:14:41,604
Right!

235
00:14:41,604 --> 00:14:43,504
The cakes are almost gone?

236
00:14:43,504 --> 00:14:45,104
It's crazy.

237
00:14:52,604 --> 00:14:54,604
A piece of wood?

238
00:14:54,604 --> 00:14:57,604
Sir! No weapons were found.

239
00:14:57,604 --> 00:15:00,004
I see. Nothing was found?

240
00:15:00,004 --> 00:15:03,504
The weapon is gone because it's been eaten already.

241
00:15:03,504 --> 00:15:05,104
Can we think this way?

242
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,904
What do you mean by that?

243
00:15:06,904 --> 00:15:09,104
This is a candy house.

244
00:15:09,104 --> 00:15:11,804
It's possible that the weapon was made of sweets.

245
00:15:11,804 --> 00:15:15,304
Who would eat stuff that was used to kill somebody?

246
00:15:15,304 --> 00:15:16,304
But if we think that way,

247
00:15:16,304 --> 00:15:20,804
the types of sweets that were made into weapon would be limited.

248
00:15:20,804 --> 00:15:22,204
It's not cookies.

249
00:15:22,204 --> 00:15:23,804
They would break.

250
00:15:23,804 --> 00:15:25,604
Not pies or tarts of course.

251
00:15:25,604 --> 00:15:28,704
It can't be my chocolate.

252
00:15:28,704 --> 00:15:31,204
Because is pretty soft.

253
00:15:31,204 --> 00:15:33,304
Now what? You're saying I killed her with my candy

254
00:15:33,304 --> 00:15:36,204
and ate the sweet bloody weapon?

255
00:15:36,204 --> 00:15:39,104
A candy as a murder weapon.

256
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,104
It's too big to eat.

257
00:15:41,104 --> 00:15:42,804
Oh, I'm sorry.

258
00:15:42,804 --> 00:15:46,104
Or maybe she melted the candy.

259
00:15:46,104 --> 00:15:50,304
She put the candy into a pot that was heated up beforehand.

260
00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:52,304
I never done anything like that!

261
00:15:52,304 --> 00:15:55,604
She could be the one who did those things

262
00:15:55,604 --> 00:15:58,304
because nobody could hear or see what she was doing.

263
00:15:58,304 --> 00:16:01,304
I didn't do it! It's the truth!

264
00:16:01,304 --> 00:16:04,304
Well, we'll find out whether it's true or not,

265
00:16:04,304 --> 00:16:06,404
after the identification.

266
00:16:06,404 --> 00:16:09,304
Is she the killer?

267
00:16:09,304 --> 00:16:13,304
It's my dream to win a contest with these candies someday.

268
00:16:14,504 --> 00:16:16,104
No, it can't be.

269
00:16:26,504 --> 00:16:27,904
This is...

270
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,304
As expected, she isn't be the murderer.

271
00:16:36,804 --> 00:16:37,904
So messy.

272
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:47,504
How come pieces of wood are in the kitchen?

273
00:16:47,504 --> 00:16:48,704
When I came here yesterday,

274
00:16:48,704 --> 00:16:51,704
there was no "Wood Chocolate Cake making trial".

275
00:16:51,704 --> 00:16:53,004
You're so lucky.

276
00:16:54,104 --> 00:16:55,104
I got it!

277
00:16:59,204 --> 00:17:01,404
So she was being used.

278
00:17:01,404 --> 00:17:03,304
But you're not having it your way!

279
00:17:05,504 --> 00:17:07,304
No. The murderer...

280
00:17:12,804 --> 00:17:14,304
Ran.

281
00:17:14,304 --> 00:17:15,504
Sonoko?

282
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,904
The murderer is not Ms. Morimoto.

283
00:17:21,904 --> 00:17:23,904
Sonoko! That thing again?

284
00:17:23,904 --> 00:17:25,004
What?

285
00:17:25,004 --> 00:17:29,304
She was trying so hard to make candies for the afternoon

286
00:17:29,304 --> 00:17:31,904
just to convince Ms. Hashigaki that she was good enough.

287
00:17:31,904 --> 00:17:38,404
As a proof, there are candies in her kitchen for tasting.

288
00:17:38,404 --> 00:17:41,604
Ran, could you show everybody the thing in my left hand?

289
00:17:41,604 --> 00:17:43,104
Okay.

290
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,004
It seems like...

291
00:17:54,004 --> 00:17:57,204
it's not something that is done half-way or a failure.

292
00:17:57,204 --> 00:17:59,304
That piece of candy tells us

293
00:17:59,304 --> 00:18:02,404
how much she wanted to be a patissier and not a magician.

294
00:18:02,404 --> 00:18:05,404
I just wanted her to taste this one more time.

295
00:18:05,404 --> 00:18:07,804
Then, who murdered Ms. Hashigaki?

296
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:10,404
The real suspect is...

297
00:18:10,404 --> 00:18:13,404
The "Prince of Sweets", Mr. Fujino!

298
00:18:13,404 --> 00:18:15,004
It's you.

299
00:18:15,004 --> 00:18:16,104
First of all,

300
00:18:16,104 --> 00:18:19,704
you called Mr. Maeda by phone just to let him out of here.

301
00:18:19,704 --> 00:18:21,504
Then, after making sure Ms. Morimoto started using the blender,

302
00:18:21,504 --> 00:18:24,204
you left the kitchen.

303
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:26,504
From this point, you can't see a thing

304
00:18:26,504 --> 00:18:29,204
of what's going on in Ms. Morimoto's kitchen.

305
00:18:29,204 --> 00:18:32,104
Mr. Fujino used this blind spot!

306
00:18:32,104 --> 00:18:33,604
Good work.

307
00:18:33,604 --> 00:18:34,804
You, too.

308
00:18:44,204 --> 00:18:45,604
I'll leave the rest to you.

309
00:18:51,804 --> 00:18:54,904
So are you saying I killed her with candy?

310
00:18:54,904 --> 00:18:57,504
No, it's the Wood Chocolate Cake!

311
00:18:58,604 --> 00:18:59,904
Really! My Wood Chocolate Cake?

312
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:02,404
That soft chocolate became a weapon?

313
00:19:02,404 --> 00:19:05,004
Okay, let me explain!

314
00:19:05,004 --> 00:19:07,604
This house is called "The Candy House"

315
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,504
It seems that this candy house is totally made of sweets.

316
00:19:09,504 --> 00:19:13,704
But the truth is that this is a wooden house that's coated with sweets.

317
00:19:13,704 --> 00:19:16,604
This was how he came up with the plan,

318
00:19:16,604 --> 00:19:19,304
hiding the murder weapon under the sweets.

319
00:19:19,304 --> 00:19:20,304
What?

320
00:19:20,304 --> 00:19:23,204
So he hid the weapon under the Wood Chocolate Cake, am I correct?

321
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:28,204
Right! A piece of wood was used to kill Ms. Hashigaki!

322
00:19:28,204 --> 00:19:29,904
You are a very careless man.

323
00:19:29,904 --> 00:19:32,604
You hid the piece of wood that's smaller than your Wood Chocolate Cake

324
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,104
in your kitchen beforehand.

325
00:19:37,404 --> 00:19:40,904
Then you brought the wood chocolate to Conan,

326
00:19:40,904 --> 00:19:42,604
with the piece of wood hidden under the tray.

327
00:19:42,604 --> 00:19:47,304
You hit the back of the victim's head with it.

328
00:19:48,804 --> 00:19:50,904
Show me the evidence if you say so!

329
00:19:50,904 --> 00:19:54,304
The evidence lies in Mr. Fujino's corner over there.

330
00:19:54,304 --> 00:19:57,104
Conan, would you get the wood chocolates for me, please?

331
00:19:57,104 --> 00:19:58,304
Okay.

332
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,404
Let me help you.

333
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:08,304
Thank you, Miss!

334
00:20:12,804 --> 00:20:14,904
Conan, I'll pay for them.

335
00:20:14,904 --> 00:20:17,204
So give everyone a piece of the Wood Chocolate Cake.

336
00:20:17,204 --> 00:20:18,304
Okay!

337
00:20:28,304 --> 00:20:31,704
Sonoko, there's something in the cake. I can't cut it.

338
00:20:31,704 --> 00:20:33,204
What is it?

339
00:20:33,204 --> 00:20:35,904
It looks like there is a real piece of wood in the cake.

340
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:42,104
Mr. Fujino hid the real murder weapon inside the chocolate cream

341
00:20:42,104 --> 00:20:43,904
and put the cake on the tray.

342
00:20:43,904 --> 00:20:47,104
Then, as he promised Conan,

343
00:20:47,104 --> 00:20:50,804
he walked out the door with the real Wood Chocolate Cake.

344
00:20:55,104 --> 00:20:59,504
Chief was literally like a witch that's on the wall of this candy house.

345
00:20:59,504 --> 00:21:02,004
She promised me to give me my own store, if I win a contest

346
00:21:02,004 --> 00:21:04,904
and work with her for three years.

347
00:21:04,904 --> 00:21:07,004
So I won a contest with my Wood Chocolate Cake

348
00:21:07,004 --> 00:21:09,104
and worked for three years.

349
00:21:09,104 --> 00:21:10,804
I never complained at all,

350
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:13,104
even if I had to work like a bee.

351
00:21:13,104 --> 00:21:15,804
But as soon as I became popular,

352
00:21:15,804 --> 00:21:17,404
Ms. Hashigaki took back what she said before.

353
00:21:17,404 --> 00:21:19,804
She even say that she would take the Wood Chocolate Cake away from me.

354
00:21:19,804 --> 00:21:23,504
Finally, she said there was no promise made between us at all!

355
00:21:25,304 --> 00:21:26,504
I just...

356
00:21:28,004 --> 00:21:31,604
Let's talk at the station, shall we?

357
00:21:31,604 --> 00:21:34,004
The dream of becoming independent

358
00:21:34,004 --> 00:21:35,404
and his Wood Chocolate Cake that was a part of his life

359
00:21:35,404 --> 00:21:38,504
were both taken away by his chief.

360
00:21:38,504 --> 00:21:42,304
For him, Ms. Hashigaki was a witch,

361
00:21:42,304 --> 00:21:45,404
who was trying to cage and eat him,

362
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,904
just like the one in Hansel and Gretel.

363
00:23:19,504 --> 00:23:21,004
"Ecriture"

364
00:23:21,004 --> 00:23:22,504
Oh, no!

365
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:27,504
My chocolate cake!

366
00:23:27,504 --> 00:23:30,604
No! It's ruined!

367
00:23:30,604 --> 00:23:32,004
It's fine!

368
00:23:32,004 --> 00:23:34,604
You still can eat it. It looks same when it gets to the stomach.

369
00:23:34,604 --> 00:23:35,804
That's right!

370
00:23:35,804 --> 00:23:38,104
Hey, what are you talking about?

371
00:23:38,104 --> 00:23:42,304
Come on! You just need to find another good chocolate cake store, right?

372
00:23:43,404 --> 00:23:44,404
Oh, yeah!

373
00:23:44,404 --> 00:23:46,504
I think there's a delicious cake buffet restaurant

374
00:23:46,504 --> 00:23:48,904
beside the train station!

375
00:23:48,904 --> 00:23:50,004
-What? -What?

376
00:23:50,004 --> 00:23:51,304
We have to hurry! Come on!

377
00:23:52,804 --> 00:23:54,504
Hold up, Sonoko!

378
00:23:56,304 --> 00:23:58,504
Hey... No way!

379
00:24:31,631 --> 00:24:34,231
Next Conan's Hint:

380
00:24:34,231 --> 00:24:36,231
"Rumor"

381
00:24:36,231 --> 00:24:38,131
The next episode's got a weird title.

382
00:24:38,131 --> 00:24:40,931
The lucky people should be Inspector Megure and uncle, right?
