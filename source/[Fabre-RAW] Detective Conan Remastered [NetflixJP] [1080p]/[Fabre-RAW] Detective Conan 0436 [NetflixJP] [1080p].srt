1
00:00:01,764 --> 00:00:03,764
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:03,764 --> 00:00:05,664
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:05,664 --> 00:00:07,164
A surprising incident occurs at the interview site.

4
00:00:07,164 --> 00:00:08,764
The Youth Detective Squad fight as one.

5
00:00:08,764 --> 00:00:10,464
Their deductions surpass those of the police!

6
00:00:10,464 --> 00:00:11,964
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,964 --> 00:00:13,664
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:15,464
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,505 --> 00:02:00,605
Popular freelance writer, Mr. Masato Sugimori,

10
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:03,505
comes to Teitan Elementary School wanting to interview the activities

11
00:02:03,505 --> 00:02:05,105
of the Youth Detective Squad.

12
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:09,705
Some days later, we go with Ms. Kobayashi

13
00:02:09,705 --> 00:02:12,705
to Mr. Sugimori's residence.

14
00:02:12,705 --> 00:02:15,705
However, we found Mr. Sugimori's dead body there.

15
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:19,705
As a result of site investigation,

16
00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:21,905
I deduce that the suspect is among the four who left messages

17
00:02:21,905 --> 00:02:24,605
in the answer phone.

18
00:02:25,805 --> 00:02:31,705
"The Youth Detective Squad is Interviewed (Part 2)"

19
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:34,605
Inspector, the recording device has arrived.

20
00:02:34,605 --> 00:02:36,105
Is that right?

21
00:02:38,005 --> 00:02:41,205
Okay, let's hear the first message.

22
00:02:48,205 --> 00:02:50,405
It's the sound of the railroad crossing nearby.

23
00:02:56,805 --> 00:02:58,705
It's so long.

24
00:02:58,705 --> 00:03:01,705
It's already more than two minutes since it's started ringing.

25
00:03:02,905 --> 00:03:04,505
-It... -It stopped.

26
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:07,005
Let's hear the first one.

27
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:08,505
There are four messages.

28
00:03:09,805 --> 00:03:11,505
Mr. Sugimori?

29
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:13,205
This is Haruka.

30
00:03:13,205 --> 00:03:15,205
I seem to have drunk too much last night.

31
00:03:15,205 --> 00:03:16,305
-I'm sorry. -There seems to be...

32
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:18,305
-I'm not angry anymore. -a lot of pollen in the air.

33
00:03:18,305 --> 00:03:21,005
-I thought you were seeing someone else -How do you deal with hay fever?

34
00:03:21,005 --> 00:03:24,305
-because you never take me to your room. -The information we'll provide...

35
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:27,705
-Call me if you receive my message. -for April 22nd is pollen allergy!

36
00:03:27,705 --> 00:03:30,805
Received on Friday, 11:25.

37
00:03:32,105 --> 00:03:35,405
Inspector, there's a sound of the television in the background.

38
00:03:35,405 --> 00:03:40,605
Yeah. This is the program playing from 11:00 on Nichiuri TV, "Meippai TV".

39
00:03:40,605 --> 00:03:43,505
April 22nd is yesterday,

40
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:44,805
so we can call the television station

41
00:03:44,805 --> 00:03:47,605
and confirm what time they aired the program.

42
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:51,205
This is Higaki.

43
00:03:51,205 --> 00:03:53,805
-I'm heading over to your place... -The next station is Okuho. Okuho.

44
00:03:53,805 --> 00:03:56,705
-because I want to apologize to you in person. -Please watch...

45
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:59,105
If you're not home, I'll go another day.

46
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,605
I'm really sorry about the car.

47
00:04:01,605 --> 00:04:03,205
Later.

48
00:04:03,205 --> 00:04:07,205
Received on Friday, 11:27.

49
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:11,205
The sound in the background is the announcement inside a train.

50
00:04:11,205 --> 00:04:14,105
Okuho Station is quite some distance from here,

51
00:04:14,105 --> 00:04:16,805
so it'll take him a little over 30 minutes to get here.

52
00:04:20,205 --> 00:04:22,105
This is Inaba from Koeikan.

53
00:04:22,105 --> 00:04:25,005
I wanted to ask you about your progress on the article we requested.

54
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:27,205
Chief, what's today's date?

55
00:04:27,205 --> 00:04:31,105
It's April 22nd, 11:28.

56
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:35,005
The deadline is a week from now, so please keep up your good work.

57
00:04:35,005 --> 00:04:38,005
-Chief, are you watching the game tonight? -If this is about the scoop,

58
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:39,005
I'm not upset about it anymore.

59
00:04:39,005 --> 00:04:41,905
-Don't worry. It'll be held at Tohto Dome. -Continue work for us as always.

60
00:04:41,905 --> 00:04:45,205
Received on Friday, 11:29.

61
00:04:45,205 --> 00:04:47,205
This time it's the voices of other people.

62
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:49,705
It seems he called from his work place.

63
00:04:49,705 --> 00:04:50,805
The chief and another person

64
00:04:50,805 --> 00:04:53,505
seem to have been there other than the caller.

65
00:04:53,505 --> 00:04:56,405
Isn't Koeikan some distance away from here, too?

66
00:04:56,405 --> 00:04:57,505
Yes.

67
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:01,405
If by train, you've got to transfer. It'll take an hour even by car.

68
00:05:01,405 --> 00:05:03,805
Now for the last message.

69
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,305
I'm the one who called you a while ago,

70
00:05:07,305 --> 00:05:11,705
the homeroom teacher for first grade, Class B, Kobayashi.

71
00:05:13,405 --> 00:05:16,305
I'm sorry. It seems I have hay fever.

72
00:05:17,405 --> 00:05:19,305
I have something I'd like to ask you.

73
00:05:19,305 --> 00:05:21,305
I'll ask you when we go over to see you tomorrow.

74
00:05:22,505 --> 00:05:25,105
I'll see you tomorrow.

75
00:05:25,105 --> 00:05:28,605
Received on Friday, 11:30.

76
00:05:28,605 --> 00:05:31,205
This is your voice, right, Ms. Kobayashi?

77
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,505
Yes.

78
00:05:33,505 --> 00:05:36,205
Which means that Ms. Kobayashi is the killer!

79
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:39,105
-What? -No, hardly.

80
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,005
Because if Ms. Kobayashi were the killer,

81
00:05:41,005 --> 00:05:44,705
she would've forced her way inside the room and run over to the body.

82
00:05:44,705 --> 00:05:47,505
That way, when the police investigate later,

83
00:05:47,505 --> 00:05:52,305
she could mislead them, even if they found her hair or her fingerprints.

84
00:05:52,305 --> 00:05:56,505
-Hey, hold back a bit, will you? -Sorry.

85
00:05:56,505 --> 00:05:58,905
By the way, what is this thing you wanted to ask about

86
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:01,005
that you mentioned in your message?

87
00:06:01,005 --> 00:06:03,905
Right. It's about the interview of the children.

88
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:09,105
There's no mistake that you left your message at 11:30 yesterday?

89
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:13,505
Yes. You can also hear the bell ringing for the start of 4th period.

90
00:06:13,505 --> 00:06:16,705
Yesterday, at around 11:22 right after 3rd period,

91
00:06:16,705 --> 00:06:18,005
I called Mr. Sugimori to tell him

92
00:06:18,005 --> 00:06:20,605
that the children have accepted to do the interview.

93
00:06:20,605 --> 00:06:24,005
I remembered that I had a question and called him,

94
00:06:24,005 --> 00:06:27,105
but his phone was already on answer phone at that time.

95
00:06:27,105 --> 00:06:33,705
Then the crime was committed within 30 minutes from 11:22.

96
00:06:33,705 --> 00:06:35,105
But, inspector,

97
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:39,005
according to Ms. Kobayashi, since the time on this phone is accurate,

98
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:41,805
it occurred in the three minutes between 11:22

99
00:06:41,805 --> 00:06:44,305
and when the first message was left in the machine at 11:25.

100
00:06:44,305 --> 00:06:47,305
Three minutes. What a piece of work.

101
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:49,005
True.

102
00:06:49,005 --> 00:06:50,005
Come to think of it,

103
00:06:50,005 --> 00:06:52,305
when I called him telling him that we'd accept the interview,

104
00:06:52,305 --> 00:06:54,505
he mentioned that he was expecting someone to come soon.

105
00:06:56,105 --> 00:06:57,805
Did you get the name?

106
00:06:57,805 --> 00:06:58,805
No.

107
00:06:59,905 --> 00:07:01,305
Police?

108
00:07:01,305 --> 00:07:03,805
I already paid for my parking ticket.

109
00:07:04,605 --> 00:07:07,405
No. It's actually about Mr. Sugimori.

110
00:07:07,405 --> 00:07:10,705
Did you leave a message in his answer phone yesterday afternoon?

111
00:07:10,705 --> 00:07:12,305
"Haruka Aida (29)" -Yes.

112
00:07:12,305 --> 00:07:16,505
I got wasted last night and seemed to have picked on him a lot.

113
00:07:16,505 --> 00:07:19,805
Do you remember where you called him from?

114
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:22,405
I called from my condo on my cell phone.

115
00:07:22,405 --> 00:07:24,505
Is there anyone who can verify this?

116
00:07:24,505 --> 00:07:27,705
No. But what is this all about?

117
00:07:27,705 --> 00:07:30,005
Well, we'll give you the details later.

118
00:07:30,005 --> 00:07:32,505
We'll send a car to pick you up, so could I have your address, please?

119
00:07:32,505 --> 00:07:34,705
Yes. Gizencho I-chome...

120
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,505
Gizencho?

121
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:39,005
That sure is a place far from here.

122
00:07:40,505 --> 00:07:43,105
What? Did I call Sugimori?

123
00:07:43,105 --> 00:07:45,805
"Toshinori Higaki (33)" -Yeah. I did yesterday

124
00:07:45,805 --> 00:07:48,505
from inside the Tohto Kanjo Line train.

125
00:07:48,505 --> 00:07:50,205
But I only got the answer phone.

126
00:07:50,205 --> 00:07:52,605
Were you with someone at that time?

127
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,305
No, I was alone.

128
00:07:55,305 --> 00:07:58,305
Don't tell me that he went crying to the police

129
00:07:58,305 --> 00:08:00,805
about the scratch on the bumper of his Ferrari?

130
00:08:00,805 --> 00:08:04,305
I slightly bumped into a telephone pole when I borrowed the car from him.

131
00:08:04,305 --> 00:08:06,405
He was pissed though.

132
00:08:06,405 --> 00:08:09,505
I'm sorry, Inaba just stepped out.

133
00:08:09,505 --> 00:08:12,005
I think he'll be back soon though.

134
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:14,605
Yes. I'm the editor-in-chief, Hayashi.

135
00:08:14,605 --> 00:08:16,805
What do you police want with him?

136
00:08:16,805 --> 00:08:21,205
Do you know where he was at about 11:30 yesterday?

137
00:08:21,205 --> 00:08:25,205
No. Editors go in and out a lot.

138
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:28,805
He left a message in a certain person's answer phone

139
00:08:28,805 --> 00:08:31,205
and we hear your voice in the background saying,

140
00:08:31,205 --> 00:08:34,705
"It's April 22nd, 11:28."

141
00:08:36,105 --> 00:08:38,705
Then I'm sure he was here in the editing room.

142
00:08:38,705 --> 00:08:40,805
His cell phone isn't working well,

143
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:43,005
so he usually asks me for the date and time.

144
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:47,005
I've been telling him for the past year to hurry and buy a new one, but...

145
00:08:47,005 --> 00:08:49,705
Chief, you're going to the ball game tonight, aren't you?

146
00:08:49,705 --> 00:08:50,905
Is it going to be okay?

147
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,705
I'm worried because it's not going to be at the Tohto Dome tonight.

148
00:08:53,705 --> 00:08:56,005
It's not about the game, but how're you feeling?

149
00:08:57,205 --> 00:09:00,105
I slept all night and got over my cold right away.

150
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:02,105
My eyes aren't blood shot anymore either.

151
00:09:02,105 --> 00:09:04,505
I must've been tired.

152
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:07,705
Inaba, there was a call from the police for you!

153
00:09:07,705 --> 00:09:09,405
"Atsushi Inaba (32)" -The police?

154
00:09:09,405 --> 00:09:10,705
I wonder what is it for?

155
00:09:12,005 --> 00:09:14,705
Mr. Inaba, please wait at the editing room,

156
00:09:14,705 --> 00:09:16,605
-until we go and pick you up. -Don't you think it's strange?

157
00:09:16,605 --> 00:09:17,905
I agree.

158
00:09:17,905 --> 00:09:19,105
What seems to be the matter?

159
00:09:19,105 --> 00:09:21,005
The 2nd message in the phone.

160
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:23,205
Something's strange about the announcement in the train.

161
00:09:23,205 --> 00:09:27,205
They usually say, "Please watch your footsteps when disembarking."

162
00:09:28,005 --> 00:09:30,605
-Because I want to apologize to you in person. -Please watch...

163
00:09:30,605 --> 00:09:31,605
If you're not home,

164
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:34,305
-It's true that it's stopped at "Please watch..." -I'll go another day.

165
00:09:34,305 --> 00:09:37,005
Let's call and confirm just to be sure.

166
00:09:37,005 --> 00:09:40,105
What? The conductor that did the announcement

167
00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:41,805
had hay fever?

168
00:09:41,805 --> 00:09:45,205
Yes. That was me.

169
00:09:45,205 --> 00:09:48,205
I came down with hay fever all of a sudden yesterday

170
00:09:48,205 --> 00:09:51,505
that I couldn't hold up till the Tohto Kanjo Line made its round.

171
00:09:51,505 --> 00:09:54,505
I had someone else take my place after noon time.

172
00:09:54,505 --> 00:09:56,605
Is that right?

173
00:09:56,605 --> 00:09:58,705
It seems that he stopped at "Please watch..."

174
00:09:58,705 --> 00:10:01,405
because he was holding back sneezing.

175
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:03,305
I see.

176
00:10:03,305 --> 00:10:06,305
I confirmed with my wife as to the 1st message where "Meippai TV"

177
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,105
was aired in the background,

178
00:10:08,105 --> 00:10:13,105
and was told that hay fever information really started at around 11:25.

179
00:10:13,105 --> 00:10:16,605
Which means they both seem to have an alibi.

180
00:10:16,605 --> 00:10:17,805
No.

181
00:10:17,805 --> 00:10:20,205
There's only one person who has a solid alibi.

182
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:26,905
The sound of the railroad crossing again?

183
00:10:26,905 --> 00:10:28,305
Come to think of it,

184
00:10:28,305 --> 00:10:30,705
that is also the tracks where the Tohto Kanjo Line passes.

185
00:10:30,705 --> 00:10:34,005
It takes an hour for the Tohto Kanjo Line to make one round.

186
00:10:34,005 --> 00:10:36,305
And on weekdays,

187
00:10:36,305 --> 00:10:39,705
I think the departure and arrival times are the same.

188
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,405
Well, for the time being,

189
00:10:41,405 --> 00:10:44,105
let's hear what the three who left those messages have to say.

190
00:10:44,105 --> 00:10:46,205
-Yes. I'll go pick them up then. -No.

191
00:10:47,805 --> 00:10:49,205
I think there's only one person...

192
00:10:50,805 --> 00:10:53,305
you need to bring here.

193
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:01,042
What? Just one?

194
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:02,242
Yes.

195
00:11:02,242 --> 00:11:04,642
After killing Mr. Sugimori, the killer

196
00:11:04,642 --> 00:11:07,242
deliberately set the telephone in this room to answer phone

197
00:11:07,242 --> 00:11:10,542
in order to leave his message inside to establish an alibi, right?

198
00:11:10,542 --> 00:11:12,642
So from those three messages,

199
00:11:12,642 --> 00:11:16,442
and the calls Officer Takagi just made to the three who left them,

200
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:20,042
can't you tell who's suspicious, and who's not?

201
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:21,842
The hint is hay fever.

202
00:11:27,142 --> 00:11:28,342
Right.

203
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:32,042
Ms. Kobayashi is suspicious of me.

204
00:11:32,042 --> 00:11:35,342
But I may be wrong because after all, I'm just a kid.

205
00:11:35,342 --> 00:11:36,942
Hay fever?

206
00:11:36,942 --> 00:11:40,642
Come to think of it, all of them had something to do with hay fever.

207
00:11:40,642 --> 00:11:42,542
They're not listening to me.

208
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:46,442
At 11:25, in the background of Haruka's message,

209
00:11:46,442 --> 00:11:49,742
the sound of the hay fever information program was heard.

210
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,842
At 11:27, in Mr. Higaki's message,

211
00:11:52,842 --> 00:11:56,942
the strange announcement from within the train was heard.

212
00:11:56,942 --> 00:11:59,742
The man who made the announcement had hay fever,

213
00:11:59,742 --> 00:12:01,642
and due to him needing to try not to sneeze,

214
00:12:01,642 --> 00:12:05,342
someone else had to take his place.

215
00:12:05,342 --> 00:12:09,842
Although Mr. Inaba's message was left in the machine at 11:29,

216
00:12:09,842 --> 00:12:11,642
when asked about what date and time it was...

217
00:12:11,642 --> 00:12:15,242
It's April 22nd, 11:28.

218
00:12:15,242 --> 00:12:18,442
There was only the voice of the editor-in-chief answering as such.

219
00:12:18,442 --> 00:12:20,242
But he says nothing about pollen allergy.

220
00:12:20,242 --> 00:12:21,742
True.

221
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:27,442
Hey. When Officer Takagi called the editor-in-chief just now, didn't he say

222
00:12:27,442 --> 00:12:29,342
that he slept all night, his cold got better

223
00:12:29,342 --> 00:12:32,542
and his blood shot eyes also improved?

224
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:34,842
You experienced the same thing too, didn't you, Ms. Kobayashi?

225
00:12:34,842 --> 00:12:36,342
Yes.

226
00:12:36,342 --> 00:12:39,042
But mine wasn't a cold, it was hay fever.

227
00:12:40,742 --> 00:12:41,742
Hey.

228
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:46,842
That editor had hay fever.

229
00:12:46,842 --> 00:12:50,342
What does that have to do with this case?

230
00:12:50,342 --> 00:12:52,942
Maybe we'd better call everyone here after all, don't you think?

231
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:54,242
A little more than an hour!

232
00:12:54,242 --> 00:12:57,642
-No! It's exactly an hour! -What?

233
00:12:57,642 --> 00:12:59,542
-What's up, you two? -What is it?

234
00:13:00,842 --> 00:13:03,642
It's the time it takes for the Tohto Kanjo Line to go once around.

235
00:13:03,642 --> 00:13:06,042
That's what the two are arguing about.

236
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:09,042
When I took that train before with mom on our way home,

237
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:10,842
we both fell asleep on the train.

238
00:13:10,842 --> 00:13:12,742
It was too bothersome to transfer,

239
00:13:12,742 --> 00:13:15,042
so we stayed on the train and went once around.

240
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:18,142
But we got home a little after an hour.

241
00:13:18,142 --> 00:13:22,142
But I'm sure that according to the timetable, it was an hour.

242
00:13:22,142 --> 00:13:24,642
Although the inbound and outbound trains are slightly different,

243
00:13:24,642 --> 00:13:26,542
both are approximately about an hour.

244
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:27,542
Come to think of it,

245
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:31,442
from here to Okuho Station where the man who made the announcement at,

246
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:33,342
it would take at least 30 minutes

247
00:13:33,342 --> 00:13:35,742
regardless of whether it's inward or outward bound, right?

248
00:13:35,742 --> 00:13:36,942
Yeah.

249
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:39,742
Because Okuho is located right opposite here.

250
00:13:39,742 --> 00:13:42,242
If that man got off the train a little after noon

251
00:13:42,242 --> 00:13:44,142
before the train made its round,

252
00:13:44,142 --> 00:13:47,342
he would've got on the train after 11:00 in the morning at the earliest.

253
00:13:47,342 --> 00:13:48,742
Right.

254
00:13:48,742 --> 00:13:50,142
-So? -So?

255
00:13:51,642 --> 00:13:53,242
Hey, Ayumi.

256
00:13:53,242 --> 00:13:54,642
I see.

257
00:13:54,642 --> 00:13:55,642
Hey.

258
00:13:55,642 --> 00:14:00,142
Maybe Mr. Higaki who said he called from inside the train

259
00:14:00,142 --> 00:14:05,542
recorded that announcement and played it while talking on the phone?

260
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:06,842
I see.

261
00:14:06,842 --> 00:14:10,342
If so, it would sound as if he did in fact call from inside the train.

262
00:14:10,342 --> 00:14:12,542
I don't think so.

263
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:16,842
The station employee said he suddenly came down with hay fever yesterday.

264
00:14:16,842 --> 00:14:19,442
If the station employee got on the train after 11:00,

265
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,342
Mr. Higaki could've recorded the announcement

266
00:14:21,342 --> 00:14:22,942
only from around the same time.

267
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:26,242
Mr. Higaki's call is at 11:27.

268
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:29,242
If he was close to Okuho Station, which is over 30 minutes away from here,

269
00:14:29,242 --> 00:14:32,642
leaving a message of the train announcement is...

270
00:14:32,642 --> 00:14:37,542
To come here and push the answer phone button after killing Mr. Sugimori

271
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:40,142
is impossible. Mr. Higaki isn't a suspect.

272
00:14:40,142 --> 00:14:41,542
Right.

273
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:42,742
But...

274
00:14:42,742 --> 00:14:44,242
Hold it, Genta.

275
00:14:44,242 --> 00:14:45,242
Not yet.

276
00:14:46,742 --> 00:14:48,542
Okay. Go ahead.

277
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:53,042
But the sound of the television that was heard in Haruka's message

278
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:55,842
can easily be left from inside this room, right?

279
00:14:55,842 --> 00:14:57,742
-Okay! -I get it!

280
00:14:57,742 --> 00:15:00,442
That television was used.

281
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,742
If she turned the answering machine on after killing him

282
00:15:02,742 --> 00:15:05,842
and called here while the television was playing in the background...

283
00:15:05,842 --> 00:15:09,242
It would sound as if the caller were calling from a different place.

284
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,542
Which makes Haruka a suspect.

285
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:15,142
What's that? People are making a fuss outside.

286
00:15:15,142 --> 00:15:17,142
True.

287
00:15:17,142 --> 00:15:18,942
Hurry up and cross.

288
00:15:18,942 --> 00:15:20,442
Is it going to be long again?

289
00:15:20,442 --> 00:15:22,242
Maybe this is...

290
00:15:22,242 --> 00:15:24,042
The railroad crossing?

291
00:15:24,042 --> 00:15:25,042
Come to think of it,

292
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:28,242
it was ringing before we listened to the answer phone a while ago, too.

293
00:15:28,242 --> 00:15:30,942
This railroad crossing seems to be closed

294
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:32,542
for more than two minutes.

295
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:35,842
I checked the timetable a while ago with my cell phone

296
00:15:35,842 --> 00:15:40,642
and it seems that a train also passes here at around 11:24.

297
00:15:40,642 --> 00:15:46,142
Haruka's message was left in the answer phone at 11:25.

298
00:15:46,142 --> 00:15:48,242
According to Ms. Kobayashi's testimony,

299
00:15:48,242 --> 00:15:51,942
the estimated time of crime committed is between 11:22 to 11:25,

300
00:15:51,942 --> 00:15:53,342
which is only three minutes.

301
00:15:53,342 --> 00:15:54,742
If it's Haruka,

302
00:15:54,742 --> 00:15:56,842
she would've had to come here and hit Mr. Sugimori

303
00:15:56,842 --> 00:15:58,842
with the camera tripod when he is off his guard and kill him.

304
00:15:58,842 --> 00:16:00,342
Pushing the answering machine's on button

305
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:04,342
and leaving the room would use up almost all that time.

306
00:16:04,342 --> 00:16:06,242
It's just as Conan and the others said.

307
00:16:06,242 --> 00:16:10,042
She left the message with the sound of the television in the back.

308
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:12,642
It's impossible unless she did it from this room or somewhere around here.

309
00:16:12,642 --> 00:16:16,742
But the sound of the railroad crossing is not heard.

310
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,442
Which means she left the message

311
00:16:18,442 --> 00:16:21,442
from somewhere quite a distance from here.

312
00:16:21,442 --> 00:16:24,142
It's impossible for Haruka to commit the crime.

313
00:16:24,142 --> 00:16:26,742
So the only one left is Mr. Inaba.

314
00:16:26,742 --> 00:16:28,542
Right, Conan?

315
00:16:28,542 --> 00:16:30,442
I think so.

316
00:16:32,342 --> 00:16:35,042
What? Mr. Sugimori?

317
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:40,842
The estimated time the crime was committed is between 11:22 and 11:25.

318
00:16:40,842 --> 00:16:42,842
Where were you during that time?

319
00:16:42,842 --> 00:16:44,742
I was here in the editing room.

320
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:47,442
You heard the message that I left in the answer phone, didn't you?

321
00:16:47,442 --> 00:16:49,742
This is Inaba from Koeikan.

322
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,742
I wanted to ask you about your progress on the article we requested.

323
00:16:52,742 --> 00:16:55,142
Chief, what's today's date?

324
00:16:55,142 --> 00:16:59,142
It's April 22nd, 11:28.

325
00:16:59,142 --> 00:17:01,842
See? The voice of the editor is in it, too.

326
00:17:01,842 --> 00:17:03,442
So there's no mistake about it, is there?

327
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:05,342
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

328
00:17:05,342 --> 00:17:06,842
Ouch.

329
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:08,642
What's wrong, Mitsuhiko?

330
00:17:08,642 --> 00:17:10,442
My stomach hurts!

331
00:17:10,442 --> 00:17:16,142
It could be the mini cup milk that I put inside my tea this morning.

332
00:17:16,142 --> 00:17:19,342
The bag that had the freshness expiration on the bag was torn,

333
00:17:19,342 --> 00:17:21,342
and I saw the month April written on it

334
00:17:21,342 --> 00:17:23,242
but I couldn't read the rest of it.

335
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,942
You see, two or three days wouldn't be a problem,

336
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:27,642
but if the expiry date was something like a year ago,

337
00:17:27,642 --> 00:17:28,842
it would really be a problem.

338
00:17:28,842 --> 00:17:30,742
A year ago?

339
00:17:30,742 --> 00:17:32,042
Hey.

340
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:34,442
I think this is a role that you should play after all, Genta.

341
00:17:34,442 --> 00:17:36,742
I get it! A year ago!

342
00:17:36,742 --> 00:17:38,242
That message that was left behind

343
00:17:38,242 --> 00:17:41,542
could've been left on April 22nd a year ago.

344
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:45,742
The editor doesn't mention April 22nd of what year.

345
00:17:45,742 --> 00:17:49,242
Moreover, Mr. Inaba doesn't say which article he's referring to either.

346
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:50,442
I see.

347
00:17:50,442 --> 00:17:53,042
Which means he left something that was recorded a year ago

348
00:17:53,042 --> 00:17:57,142
inside the answer phone a year later which is yesterday,

349
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:58,542
after he committed the crime to establish an alibi.

350
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:00,042
Hey.

351
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:02,142
How can you say that?

352
00:18:02,142 --> 00:18:04,842
I really phoned from the company yesterday.

353
00:18:04,842 --> 00:18:07,042
Ms. Kobayashi, I bet you don't feel like going out much

354
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:10,542
-during hay fever season, right? -No.

355
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:13,842
Come to think of it, the editor also had a bad case of hay fever, right?

356
00:18:14,942 --> 00:18:17,942
He kept repeating that he had a cold yesterday though.

357
00:18:17,942 --> 00:18:19,942
If he in fact did have a cold,

358
00:18:19,942 --> 00:18:22,442
the more he wouldn't say the following, would he?

359
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:25,642
"Chief, are you watching the game tonight?"

360
00:18:25,642 --> 00:18:28,442
"Don't worry. It'll be held at Tohto Dome."

361
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:31,742
He sounds like he's really set on going to the game.

362
00:18:31,742 --> 00:18:34,342
The editor is a fervent baseball fan,

363
00:18:34,342 --> 00:18:36,742
so he'll go even if he has a cold.

364
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:39,442
I don't know whether he went yesterday or not though.

365
00:18:39,442 --> 00:18:44,942
But when Officer Takagi first talked to the editor on the phone, he said,

366
00:18:44,942 --> 00:18:48,142
"I'm worried because it's not going to be at the Tohto Dome tonight."

367
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:50,842
Maybe the editor made a mistake.

368
00:18:50,842 --> 00:18:53,642
Then, I wonder if he was worried about the weather?

369
00:18:53,642 --> 00:18:55,042
Yeah.

370
00:18:55,042 --> 00:18:56,442
With a weather like today,

371
00:18:56,442 --> 00:18:59,342
the game could be cancelled if there's no roof, right?

372
00:18:59,342 --> 00:19:00,642
Then what about the...

373
00:19:00,642 --> 00:19:04,142
"Don't worry because it's going to be held at Tohto Dome today."

374
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:05,942
I think he's referring to the weather.

375
00:19:05,942 --> 00:19:09,942
But it was sunshiny all day yesterday.

376
00:19:12,342 --> 00:19:13,742
I see.

377
00:19:13,742 --> 00:19:17,142
It was raining on April 22nd a year ago

378
00:19:17,142 --> 00:19:19,842
and there wasn't much pollen in the air, too.

379
00:19:19,842 --> 00:19:21,842
No, that's...

380
00:19:21,842 --> 00:19:23,942
That's just plain deduction.

381
00:19:23,942 --> 00:19:26,542
There was no sound of rain in the message.

382
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:29,042
Besides, do you have proof that I did it or something?

383
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:32,442
Hey, your motorbike outside is really dirty,

384
00:19:32,442 --> 00:19:34,042
but don't you wash it often?

385
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,542
What?

386
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,842
Your boots are all scratched up and worn out,

387
00:19:37,842 --> 00:19:40,242
so why didn't you go buy a new one together with it?

388
00:19:40,242 --> 00:19:41,342
Together?

389
00:19:41,342 --> 00:19:44,742
Because you just bought a new pair of gloves, right?

390
00:19:44,742 --> 00:19:46,342
The price tag is still on it.

391
00:19:47,442 --> 00:19:48,542
I see!

392
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:49,942
The gloves that you usually wear

393
00:19:49,942 --> 00:19:51,942
are the ones that you had on when you committed the crime.

394
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:55,442
And you noticed blood on them, so you bought new ones.

395
00:19:55,442 --> 00:19:57,642
Moreover, since the price tag is still on them,

396
00:19:57,642 --> 00:20:00,542
you must've realized it on your way here.

397
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:03,042
Let's check for blood reaction on the places

398
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:06,142
that you may have touched then.

399
00:20:06,142 --> 00:20:10,542
Let's start from the handle of you motorbike that you said you didn't wash.

400
00:20:12,142 --> 00:20:14,342
Just as expected, Mr. Sugimori's blood

401
00:20:14,342 --> 00:20:17,842
was found on the motorbike handle.

402
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,242
His motive for killing

403
00:20:19,242 --> 00:20:22,042
was the exposure article that was left in the answer phone.

404
00:20:22,042 --> 00:20:23,742
Both men had spent three years investigating

405
00:20:23,742 --> 00:20:26,342
the embezzlement case of a big political figure.

406
00:20:26,342 --> 00:20:28,542
But Sugimori sold it to another magazine

407
00:20:28,542 --> 00:20:31,742
that offered a higher price for it.

408
00:20:31,742 --> 00:20:36,042
Mr. Inaba insisted while sobbing and trembling that more than the money,

409
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:38,642
he wanted his magazine to be the first to publicize it.

410
00:20:38,642 --> 00:20:41,542
It turns out that the story about interviewing the Youth Detective Squad

411
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:44,142
was just a trick to make his story seem coherent.

412
00:20:45,342 --> 00:20:47,042
I'm sort of pooped.

413
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:49,042
I did so much talking.

414
00:20:49,042 --> 00:20:50,542
I was so nervous.

415
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:53,042
If you were to hide a leaf, the best place to do so is in the forest.

416
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:55,342
So you divide the dialogue among the other kids

417
00:20:55,342 --> 00:20:57,942
and distract her attention from you.

418
00:20:57,942 --> 00:20:59,042
Sort of.

419
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:00,542
Now, if Ms. Kobayashi...

420
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:02,542
Hey, kids.

421
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:04,842
I'd like to ask you all something.

422
00:21:04,842 --> 00:21:05,842
Here she comes.

423
00:21:10,142 --> 00:21:12,142
Do you know Ranpo Edogawa?

424
00:21:12,142 --> 00:21:13,242
Yes.

425
00:21:13,242 --> 00:21:16,742
The one that Kogoro Akechi and 20 masks come out, right?

426
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:17,742
That's right.

427
00:21:17,742 --> 00:21:21,942
You're just like the Youth Detective Squad that comes out in the series.

428
00:21:21,942 --> 00:21:23,642
I'm a great fan of the series.

429
00:21:23,642 --> 00:21:26,242
So I'd like to ask you a favour.

430
00:21:26,242 --> 00:21:27,342
What favour?

431
00:21:27,342 --> 00:21:30,142
You want to tell us to stay away from danger or something like that, right?

432
00:21:30,142 --> 00:21:33,742
We'll be just fine because we think before we act.

433
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:39,042
Nope. I'd like to join your Detective Squad.

434
00:21:39,042 --> 00:21:40,042
Would that be possible?

435
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,342
Adults can't join.

436
00:21:43,342 --> 00:21:45,242
Please keep your age in mind.

437
00:21:45,242 --> 00:21:48,042
But my name is Kobayashi, you know.

438
00:21:48,042 --> 00:21:49,642
There's no reason why I can't join, is there?

439
00:21:51,442 --> 00:21:53,142
It seems everything's okay now.

440
00:21:53,142 --> 00:21:54,742
True.

441
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:22,442
An interview again...

442
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,042
Yes. And of course,

443
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:26,542
I'll be going with you as the advisor of the Youth Detective Squad

444
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:28,342
so no need to worry.

445
00:23:28,342 --> 00:23:29,942
When did she become our advisor?

446
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:33,342
And the person who's going to interview you is the famous...

447
00:23:33,342 --> 00:23:35,242
I've had enough with interviews.

448
00:23:35,242 --> 00:23:37,242
I know I'm going to be pooped.

449
00:23:37,242 --> 00:23:40,342
Is that so?

450
00:23:40,342 --> 00:23:43,242
That's the story, so I'm very sorry.

451
00:23:43,242 --> 00:23:46,842
No, don't be. I'm sorry to have troubled you.

452
00:23:48,542 --> 00:23:51,142
I figured that Conan would take on the interview, but...

453
00:23:51,142 --> 00:23:54,242
It's amazing that he'd knock off your golden special.

454
00:23:54,242 --> 00:23:57,142
His homeroom teacher is probably one of a hard head.
