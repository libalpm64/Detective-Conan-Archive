1
00:00:07,729 --> 00:00:09,989
All here.

2
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:12,529
I'll be looking forward to it next month too.

3
00:00:12,529 --> 00:00:14,429
Give me a break already.

4
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:15,529
I can't take it anymore.

5
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:18,829
God knows what I went through to get that cash.

6
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:21,329
"Katsutoshi Kue" -You're in charge of accounting

7
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:22,729
at your company, aren't you?

8
00:00:22,729 --> 00:00:25,429
You've got loads of ways to get cash, don't you?

9
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:27,029
Don't be ridiculous!

10
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:29,029
You know I can't do something like that.

11
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,029
It doesn't really matter.

12
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:35,529
But, I wonder what'll happen if that thing about you was revealed?

13
00:00:35,529 --> 00:00:37,529
Your daughter's wedding...

14
00:00:37,529 --> 00:00:39,529
Wait. Please not that.

15
00:00:39,529 --> 00:00:42,329
If it's for the happiness of your daughter,

16
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,829
you'll do anything, wouldn't you?

17
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:53,629
Please forgive me already.

18
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:59,429
I can't keep paying that amount with my salary.

19
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:00,529
I beg you.

20
00:01:00,529 --> 00:01:02,041
If your salary's not enough,

21
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,629
why don't you part-time at night?

22
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:06,045
I already am.

23
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:08,429
But I can't go on any further.

24
00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:11,029
You can flee if you want.

25
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:16,329
But if you do, this will go on the internet.

26
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:19,329
If you don't want that to happen you know what to do, don't you?

27
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:43,729
If all cases were men,

28
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,529
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

29
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:47,429
The initial "K" that strangely stands out.

30
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:49,229
A suspicious dying message.

31
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,829
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:52,829
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:55,029
His name is Detective Conan!

34
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:24,982
"Suspicious Initial K"

35
00:03:29,182 --> 00:03:31,982
That restaurant was pretty delicious, wasn't it?

36
00:03:31,982 --> 00:03:35,882
Yes, the spring rolls were exquisite.

37
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:40,882
Isn't that Officer Tateno?

38
00:03:40,882 --> 00:03:43,782
Yes, I wonder if something happened?

39
00:03:44,782 --> 00:03:46,982
Officer Sumio Tateno,

40
00:03:46,982 --> 00:03:49,682
of Beikacho 5-chome police box.

41
00:03:49,682 --> 00:03:52,211
He's serious, honest, and a good fellow.

42
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:55,382
He is also greatly trusted by the people of the community.

43
00:03:55,382 --> 00:03:56,982
His dream has come true, and he will soon be transferred

44
00:03:56,982 --> 00:03:59,882
to the Beika Police Department detective section.

45
00:03:59,882 --> 00:04:01,982
Like I'm always saying.

46
00:04:01,982 --> 00:04:03,582
Officer Tateno.

47
00:04:03,582 --> 00:04:05,482
Is anything wrong?

48
00:04:05,482 --> 00:04:07,882
Mr. Mouri, it's no big deal.

49
00:04:07,882 --> 00:04:09,682
It is a big deal.

50
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:13,182
There's an audacious one who always messes up the trash dump,

51
00:04:13,182 --> 00:04:17,382
I'm asking him to stake out all night and nab the one.

52
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,582
Like I said,

53
00:04:18,582 --> 00:04:21,882
I'm concentrating on patroling this area, aren't I?

54
00:04:27,082 --> 00:04:28,247
Are you all right?

55
00:04:32,882 --> 00:04:34,582
Please get a hold of yourself.

56
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:40,259
Isn't that blood?

57
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:43,482
Somebody's dead inside.

58
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:44,582
What?

59
00:04:56,482 --> 00:04:57,982
Please get a hold of yourself.

60
00:04:58,982 --> 00:04:59,982
Are you all right?

61
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:06,782
So, this is the murder weapon.

62
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:10,582
There are marks of resistance on the corpse's hand.

63
00:05:10,582 --> 00:05:11,882
That cushion...

64
00:05:12,882 --> 00:05:14,293
Did the culprit stab the victim

65
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:17,682
after pushing the cushion against him to avoid splattering blood?

66
00:05:17,682 --> 00:05:19,682
Mr. Mouri, please take care of this.

67
00:05:19,682 --> 00:05:21,682
I will go and check to see if there is anyone suspicious

68
00:05:21,682 --> 00:05:22,982
in the house.

69
00:05:22,982 --> 00:05:26,882
Headquarters, Tateno of the police box in Beikacho 5-chome here.

70
00:05:29,882 --> 00:05:31,082
Sir, over there.

71
00:05:33,282 --> 00:05:34,313
"K".

72
00:05:34,482 --> 00:05:36,315
Could this be a dying message?

73
00:05:37,382 --> 00:05:39,282
Did a post crown come off?

74
00:05:41,782 --> 00:05:44,782
Did the culprit break it?

75
00:05:44,782 --> 00:05:47,082
There's no one in the house.

76
00:05:47,082 --> 00:05:48,582
The door of the kitchen

77
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:52,082
as well as all of the windows are locked from the inside.

78
00:05:52,082 --> 00:05:53,882
I see.

79
00:05:54,882 --> 00:05:58,682
The victim is Mr. Zenkichi Ooka, age 64.

80
00:05:58,682 --> 00:06:00,339
He lives alone in this house

81
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:01,582
and seems to be working as a security guard

82
00:06:01,582 --> 00:06:03,382
at a supermarket in Haidocho.

83
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:07,282
Are you the one who discovered the corpse?

84
00:06:07,282 --> 00:06:10,082
First of all, may I have your name?

85
00:06:10,082 --> 00:06:13,282
"Kiwako Kaitani (25)" -I am Kiwako Kaitani.

86
00:06:15,382 --> 00:06:17,282
Her initial is "K".

87
00:06:19,082 --> 00:06:20,359
And you?

88
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:21,482
I'm Hanazawa.

89
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:23,582
I was watching all the while.

90
00:06:23,582 --> 00:06:24,682
All the while?

91
00:06:24,682 --> 00:06:28,367
Yes. I was talking at the front door with my friend

92
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,369
Ms. Nakajima who lives in 4-chome.

93
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:32,371
Then, I think it was a little after 6:00 pm,

94
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:34,682
Mr. Ooka came home.

95
00:06:34,682 --> 00:06:35,982
Soon after,

96
00:06:35,982 --> 00:06:38,682
a man came over to Mr. Ooka's house.

97
00:06:38,682 --> 00:06:40,082
A man?

98
00:06:40,082 --> 00:06:44,383
Yes. He looked to be a business man of about 50 years old.

99
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:48,382
But he rushed off home in about 10 minutes.

100
00:06:49,982 --> 00:06:50,982
And?

101
00:06:50,982 --> 00:06:52,391
About 20 minutes later,

102
00:06:52,582 --> 00:06:57,082
she came and went into Mr. Ooka's house.

103
00:06:57,082 --> 00:07:00,082
Soon, after Ms. Nakajima went home,

104
00:07:00,082 --> 00:07:02,682
Mr. Tateno came along,

105
00:07:02,682 --> 00:07:04,403
and talked about 5 minutes,

106
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:08,407
then these people came and she came out again.

107
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:14,082
I'm sure that the man who came before me I'm sure.

108
00:07:14,082 --> 00:07:16,982
We've got to find that man right away.

109
00:07:16,982 --> 00:07:18,182
Yes, sir.

110
00:07:18,182 --> 00:07:19,482
What seems to be the matter?

111
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:23,382
It's that man who came to Mr. Ooka's house a while ago.

112
00:07:23,382 --> 00:07:26,425
See, he's among the spectators.

113
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:28,082
The man wearing that cap?

114
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:29,082
Yes.

115
00:07:30,782 --> 00:07:32,082
Hold it!

116
00:07:37,882 --> 00:07:39,682
-Why you... -Don't move!

117
00:07:39,682 --> 00:07:41,282
Let me go!

118
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:46,782
What's your name?

119
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:49,782
Katsutoshi Kusaka.

120
00:07:52,782 --> 00:07:55,682
His initial is also "K".

121
00:07:55,682 --> 00:07:58,457
"Beika Police Station"

122
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:01,482
Is this knife yours?

123
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:04,463
It... it's mine all right.

124
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:06,482
But, I didn't do it.

125
00:08:06,482 --> 00:08:10,982
Why did you go to Mr. Ooka's house in the first place?

126
00:08:10,982 --> 00:08:12,982
That's...

127
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:16,782
I was in fact being blackmailed by Ooka.

128
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:21,182
It's been 7 years ago already.

129
00:08:21,182 --> 00:08:25,182
I got hooked on mahjong gambling.

130
00:08:25,182 --> 00:08:27,682
The mahjong parlor was raided by the police

131
00:08:27,682 --> 00:08:30,982
and being a customer there I was also arrested.

132
00:08:30,982 --> 00:08:33,382
Ooka was also a regular there.

133
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:36,495
He was lucky and wasn't arrested.

134
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:40,082
Since then, I've gone completely clean, quit gambling,

135
00:08:40,082 --> 00:08:42,282
and worked as a good citizen.

136
00:08:42,282 --> 00:08:45,782
And yet I ran into that guy coicidentally

137
00:08:45,782 --> 00:08:47,082
at a supermarket 2 years ago in Haidocho

138
00:08:47,082 --> 00:08:48,882
and he's been blackmailing me since.

139
00:08:48,882 --> 00:08:50,509
He began blackmailing you?

140
00:08:50,682 --> 00:08:54,282
Yes. Every single month.

141
00:08:54,282 --> 00:08:57,582
Half a year ago, talks on my daughter's marriage were about to settle,

142
00:08:57,582 --> 00:09:01,482
and since then, he began demanding more cash.

143
00:09:01,482 --> 00:09:04,782
He appeared at a hotel in Shiomi the other day

144
00:09:04,782 --> 00:09:07,182
when we were having lunch with my daughter's groom-to-be's family.

145
00:09:07,182 --> 00:09:11,382
He said that he had a temporary security guard job nearby.

146
00:09:11,382 --> 00:09:12,531
If things go on as is,

147
00:09:12,782 --> 00:09:15,882
my daughter's marriage talks would go to shambles.

148
00:09:15,882 --> 00:09:20,182
I just couldn't bear thinking about it.

149
00:09:21,582 --> 00:09:25,882
Did you go to the victim's house today to give him the money?

150
00:09:25,882 --> 00:09:30,082
I usually give it to him at the end of the month after I get paid,

151
00:09:30,082 --> 00:09:31,482
but since he demanded that I give him cash

152
00:09:31,482 --> 00:09:33,382
for riding the Bullet train because an old friend of his died,

153
00:09:33,382 --> 00:09:35,482
and he had to attend the funeral.

154
00:09:37,282 --> 00:09:40,282
Instead of money I brought a knife.

155
00:09:40,282 --> 00:09:42,982
But while I was struggling with him,

156
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,882
I slashed his hand

157
00:09:44,882 --> 00:09:46,582
Seeing the blood splatter...

158
00:09:46,582 --> 00:09:48,082
I suddenly got scared,

159
00:09:48,082 --> 00:09:50,882
I threw the knife down and fled.

160
00:09:53,182 --> 00:09:55,082
That's really all there is to it.

161
00:09:55,082 --> 00:09:57,682
That young lady must've come after me.

162
00:09:57,682 --> 00:09:59,882
I'm sure she's the one who did it!

163
00:10:00,982 --> 00:10:03,782
We found it inside your knapsack.

164
00:10:03,782 --> 00:10:07,282
The contents is something that is extremely dangerous for the body.

165
00:10:08,282 --> 00:10:11,082
You're a pharmacist, aren't you?

166
00:10:11,082 --> 00:10:13,882
Did you steal it from the pharmacy that you work for?

167
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,682
That guy...

168
00:10:17,682 --> 00:10:20,182
He's to blame!

169
00:10:20,182 --> 00:10:22,082
I graduated last year,

170
00:10:22,082 --> 00:10:24,603
but I couldn't find a job,

171
00:10:24,782 --> 00:10:27,382
so I sort of had a nervous break down

172
00:10:27,382 --> 00:10:29,582
and began shoplifting repeatedly.

173
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:32,611
He caught me doing so,

174
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:34,982
and told me that he'd overlook it, so to give him money.

175
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:36,615
Since then, I've been paying him every month.

176
00:10:37,782 --> 00:10:39,482
After I landed myself a job,

177
00:10:39,482 --> 00:10:42,621
he demanded that I pay him double of what I already was.

178
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:45,782
He used to come out of his way to my work place

179
00:10:45,782 --> 00:10:48,982
and got his drugs prscribed there.

180
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,631
Just to think that I would be blackmailed by him all my life...

181
00:10:54,182 --> 00:10:59,182
So I hoped that he would fall ill of some grave disease or something.

182
00:10:59,182 --> 00:11:03,882
Did you stop by at the victim's house to pay him money?

183
00:11:03,882 --> 00:11:06,082
I always pay him at the beginning of the month,

184
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,647
but he suddenly told me since a friend of his in his hometown died

185
00:11:08,882 --> 00:11:10,082
and he had to go to the funeral,

186
00:11:10,082 --> 00:11:11,382
he wanted me to pay for his hotel charges.

187
00:11:11,382 --> 00:11:15,582
But, all I did was break his cell phone.

188
00:11:15,582 --> 00:11:18,382
Because the scene of my shoplifting was inside it.

189
00:11:18,382 --> 00:11:19,682
It's true!

190
00:11:19,682 --> 00:11:23,382
I'm sure that the man who came before me is the culprit, I'm sure!

191
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:29,282
Who would've thought that the victim was a blackmailer.

192
00:11:29,282 --> 00:11:31,082
According to Mr. Kusaka,

193
00:11:31,082 --> 00:11:34,182
Mr. Ooka was hoooked on a casino abroad.

194
00:11:34,182 --> 00:11:35,282
Casino?

195
00:11:35,282 --> 00:11:38,677
He probably blackmailed in order to make money for that.

196
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:41,782
Going to casinos with the money he blackmailed?

197
00:11:41,782 --> 00:11:43,882
What a guy...

198
00:11:45,282 --> 00:11:49,182
This calendar is Mr. Ooka's, right?

199
00:11:49,182 --> 00:11:50,689
No, Conan.

200
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:53,882
There are strange things written in here and there.

201
00:11:53,882 --> 00:11:55,682
What could it be?

202
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:58,697
Is it some code or what?

203
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:02,482
It probably has something to do with his blackmailing though.

204
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:08,382
You're going to be a police detective from next month.

205
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:10,709
You'd better get used to this atmosphere from now.

206
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:12,711
Yes, sir.

207
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:14,713
Hey, your cap's soiled.

208
00:12:22,982 --> 00:12:25,182
There was no one in the room

209
00:12:25,182 --> 00:12:29,382
and all the windows were locked from the inside, were they not?

210
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:31,982
Yes, sir. Exactly.

211
00:12:31,982 --> 00:12:34,182
In other words, the only ones who could've

212
00:12:34,182 --> 00:12:36,735
gone in and out of of the crime site were these two?

213
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,737
Katsutoshi Kusaka

214
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:41,082
and Kiwako Kaitani...

215
00:12:41,082 --> 00:12:43,982
the culprit is one of the two.

216
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:53,650
Which means one of the two is lying.

217
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,740
Something doesn't seem right.

218
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,740
In order to avoid splattered blood,

219
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,080
the culprit used a cushion.

220
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,040
I wonder if those two could ever commit a crime so calmly?

221
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,380
Come to think of it...

222
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,750
Did you find the post crown?

223
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,760
You keep out of this, kid!

224
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,775
But, it bothers me.

225
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:19,470
It wasn't found on the site.

226
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,560
If it came off when he struggled with the culprit,

227
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,480
there is a possibility that it's on th eclothes of the culprit.

228
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,770
There was none on the clothes of the two.

229
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,270
It's thinkable that Mr. Kusaka who left the site once,

230
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,440
could've disposed of it somewhere.

231
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,570
Officer Takagi and Sato,

232
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,950
go and continue interrogating the two.

233
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,870
Officer Chiba, go and check on the associates of the victim.

234
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:45,080
There may be other blackmail victims too.

235
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,080
Yes, sir.

236
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,460
"Maru" Oka?

237
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,050
So, I see.

238
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,350
If so, what on earth does that "K" mean?

239
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,829
Why is it a place like this?

240
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:14,833
I see, I got.

241
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,843
Mr. Mouri?

242
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,849
Inspector, it's getting late

243
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,851
so I guess it's about time to get to the bottom of things.

244
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,550
What? Did you figure out who the culprit is?

245
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,855
Yes, sir.

246
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:39,260
I shall tell you what really happened from now,

247
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,861
so will you please bring the two suspects here?

248
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:44,050
The two?

249
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,871
You're the only people who went in and out of the site of the crime

250
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:54,440
after Mr. Ooka returned home.

251
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,940
I didn't do it!

252
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,360
Me niether!

253
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,570
The letter "K" was found written at the scene.

254
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,950
It is highly unlikely that either one of you wrote it

255
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,660
to confuse the investigation.

256
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:10,370
Therefore, it's hightly probable that it was a dying message

257
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,040
that was written by the victim.

258
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,670
But, both their initials are "K",

259
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,895
it's hard to determine which of the two the killer is, on this alone...

260
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:22,901
Mr. Kusaka, weren't you paying Mr. Ooka on the 27th of each month?

261
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:24,180
Yes.

262
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,970
You, on the 5th, right, Ms. Kaitani?

263
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,060
Yes, that's right.

264
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,060
Wasn't it the 8th that Mr. Ooka appeared at the hotel in Shiomi?

265
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,560
Exactly.

266
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,270
Mr. Ooka came to the pharmacy on the 17th, didn't he?

267
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,360
How did you know?

268
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,450
It's all written in on the calendar.

269
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,240
Calendar? You mean that code?

270
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,927
Please look at the name tape of Mr. Ooka's notebook.

271
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,460
Zero "oka".

272
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,750
That's read "Ooka".

273
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,937
It's not zero, but rather, the alphabet "O".

274
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:00,960
Mr. Ooka seems to have had the habit of writing

275
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,470
in the names of people and places,

276
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,840
symbolizing them with letters of the alphabet and numbers.

277
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,947
Are you saying that, the code "9A" (kyu A) that is written in on the 27th,

278
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:11,480
"89" on the 5th,

279
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,953
symbolize Mr. Kusaka and Ms. Kaitani?

280
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:17,270
The name Kusaka if read in Chinse style,

281
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,957
is read "Kyuei" (9A).

282
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,650
Ms. Kaitani is a pharmacist.

283
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:26,240
The letter 89 (yaku) is used to refer to the word pharmaceutical,

284
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,967
and he added the word woman.

285
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:32,250
I see, so the number "403"

286
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,973
is shiomi if read in Japanese style.

287
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,460
So, the code "100" written in on the 17th

288
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,380
should be read "Jyuo" (10+O)...

289
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,260
which stands for pharmacy in Jyuo.

290
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:46,260
I see.

291
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:49,550
If so, the "K" that was found at the site...

292
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,770
It's neither Katsutoshi Kusaka nor Kiwako Kaitani.

293
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,270
That stands for...

294
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,480
of Keikan meaning police officer in Japanese!

295
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,280
The culprit is you, Officer Tateno!

296
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,660
Officer Tateno is the culprit?

297
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,007
No way.

298
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:11,580
Please wait.

299
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,660
If that were to really stand for the "K" of Keikan-police officer,

300
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,540
why would that make me the culprit?

301
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,370
When the corpse was found,

302
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,460
you went into the house

303
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,019
saying that you're going to check if there were any suspicious people

304
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,760
and headed first of all for the kitchen.

305
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,023
Isn't that strange?

306
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,025
Why didn't you check the room on the opposite side

307
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,027
which was the closest first of all?

308
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,029
Well...

309
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,033
Back then, you went to lock the kitchen door.

310
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:37,035
The kitchen door that you went in

311
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:39,037
and out of when you committed the crime.

312
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:40,560
That trash dump guy,

313
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,041
I'll bet that was you too.

314
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,043
Since you wanted to avoid being suspected of loitering around the area

315
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:48,360
while gathering information on Mr. Ooka,

316
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,450
you made it look as if you were frequently patroling that area.

317
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:54,160
That's how you found out that Mr. Kusaka

318
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,040
and Ms. Kaitani would be visiting Mr. Ooka.

319
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,059
Taking advantage of this, you schemed up a plan to kill Mr. Ooka.

320
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:03,061
Wrong.

321
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:05,960
After Mr. Kusaka left the site,

322
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,680
you snuck into the house from the kitchen door,

323
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,680
killed Mr. Ooka then left again from the same door.

324
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:17,075
Then, you appeared before Mrs. Hanazawa as if nothing had happened.

325
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,640
That's all nonsense!

326
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,560
Do you have any proof?

327
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,440
There was something on your cap, wasn't there?

328
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,070
Wasn't it sugar?

329
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,089
Ants were gathered where you're standing.

330
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,580
True.

331
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,370
There was sugar spilled at the site.

332
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,370
When you killed Mr. Ooka,

333
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,750
your cap came off, didn't it?

334
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,880
And fell on the sugar.

335
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,380
Nothing of that sort...

336
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,460
One more thing.

337
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,840
When you brushed the cap off,

338
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,050
you faced the soiled part downward and brushed it off, right?

339
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,113
I thought it was strange.

340
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:59,117
Maybe you've got a reason for not wanting to flip your cap over?

341
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,119
Well...

342
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:03,121
If my deduction is correct,

343
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,070
Mr. Ooka's post crown that disappeared from site...

344
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,360
is inside your cap.

345
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:13,131
Officer Tateno, take off your cap.

346
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:14,450
Oh, well...

347
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,960
Here it is!

348
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,040
It's highly likely

349
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,960
that Mr. Ooka's post crown that fell off

350
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,750
fell in to your cap that came off.

351
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,550
When I mentioned this,

352
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,170
you realized it,

353
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,340
and not wanting the post crown to fall out,

354
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,760
you couldn't turn your cap upside down.

355
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,350
Officer Tateno, why did you do something like that?

356
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,150
Answer me, Officer Tateno!

357
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,150
The fact is, when I was still a student,

358
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,660
I used to be a regular and gambled playing mahjong

359
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,950
at the same parlor where Mr. Kusaka used to go.

360
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:02,160
I, like Ooka, lucky was spared being arrested.

361
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,960
But, since then I changed my ways,

362
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,880
studied hard and became a police officer.

363
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,550
But six months ago,

364
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:14,470
I ran into Ooka who was working as a security guard at a supermarket

365
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,680
where I went to pick up a shoplifter.

366
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,560
But, wasn't Mr. Ooka's work place in Haidocho?

367
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,480
It seems he came in as a substitute

368
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,270
for a security guard who called in sick.

369
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,560
He remembered me.

370
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,570
And he startled blackmailing me.

371
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,450
You were giving him money every month on the 11th?

372
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,950
The character that was written on the calendar

373
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,660
is something you wrote in

374
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,240
by adding the left part on to the letter "K", isn't it?

375
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,750
That's right.

376
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,223
Every month since then...

377
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,880
Last month,

378
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,460
I got a notice that I would be transferred to the Detective section.

379
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,050
When Ooka found out about this,

380
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,233
he started demanding even more money.

381
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:57,235
Officer Tateno...

382
00:20:57,235 --> 00:21:02,640
I investigated and found that there were many more victims.

383
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,650
I figured I couldn't let him go on the way he was.

384
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:11,570
That's right, I punished him.

385
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,940
To save all the people who were made to suffer because of him.

386
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,780
In the name of justice!

387
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:21,240
This punishment in the name of justice!

388
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,263
Don't you dare claim justice with that mouth of yours!

389
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:26,870
No matter how you put it,

390
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,040
what you did is commit homicide!

391
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,750
It's nothing more than a dirty crime.

392
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,050
And the stupid crime that you committed threw dirt

393
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,260
and hurt the pride of all the 290,000 officers

394
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,260
there are throughout the nation!

395
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,970
You don't have a tinge of a right to claim justice!

396
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:57,280
Sumio Tateno, you're under arrest on murder charge!

397
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:23,070
I am very sorry to have caused you both a great discomfort

398
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,570
because of this case.

399
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,370
Don't be...

400
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:29,370
However, Mr. Kusaka, you will be charged with assault,

401
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:32,750
and Ms. Kitani, you will be arrested on charges of burglary.

402
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,040
Do you understand?

403
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,393
Yes.

404
00:23:35,393 --> 00:23:37,395
I understand.

405
00:23:37,395 --> 00:23:38,960
One mistake

406
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,260
and either of you may have committed the same crime as Tateno.

407
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,350
Keep that in mind,

408
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,850
and after compensating for each of your crimes respectively,

409
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,140
go on and live a righteous life.

410
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,980
Yes.

411
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,850
I'm very sorry.

412
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,940
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,440
"Umbrella".

414
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,888
A request from Officer Chiba?

415
00:24:07,888 --> 00:24:09,894
Like, I'm a great detective that even the police rely on?

416
00:24:09,894 --> 00:24:11,020
No way.
