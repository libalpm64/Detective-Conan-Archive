1
00:00:02,155 --> 00:00:05,755
In order to kill time until the cake arrives at Doc's house,

2
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:08,855
we decided to play soccer in the park.

3
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:10,555
Partway through the game, we chased Tai,

4
00:00:10,555 --> 00:00:13,255
a cat that has its territory in the vicinity of coffee shop Poirot,

5
00:00:13,255 --> 00:00:15,995
and end up being locked up in a refrigerated compartment

6
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:17,997
of a courier truck.

7
00:00:20,155 --> 00:00:23,455
Furthermore, since Haibara's handmade sweater unravels

8
00:00:23,455 --> 00:00:26,005
and she ends up being improperly dressed,

9
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:29,455
not being able to get off the truck, we were locked inside.

10
00:00:29,455 --> 00:00:30,955
While we were doing this and that's,

11
00:00:30,955 --> 00:00:32,011
we discover a man's corpse

12
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:34,455
in one of the cardboard boxes of the truck.

13
00:00:34,455 --> 00:00:37,555
We tried to contact the police using Mitsuhiko's cell phone,

14
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:40,355
but it runs out of battery.

15
00:00:40,355 --> 00:00:43,055
So then we tried to get in contact somehow with people outside

16
00:00:43,055 --> 00:00:46,655
by using the things we had on hand.

17
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:50,029
I have a handkerchief, pocket tissue,

18
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:52,055
candy and a cotton swab.

19
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:56,555
-How about you, Genta? -I've got...

20
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:58,955
Band-aid, a chocolate bar,

21
00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:01,455
and anti-itching ointment for frost bites.

22
00:01:01,455 --> 00:01:02,655
And, what about you, Mitsuhiko?

23
00:01:02,655 --> 00:01:04,855
I have...

24
00:01:04,855 --> 00:01:08,047
A memo pad, a ball point pen to go with it,

25
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:11,855
a handkerchief, a wallet, and a taxi receipt.

26
00:01:14,955 --> 00:01:16,755
If I remember correctly, this cat...

27
00:01:18,655 --> 00:01:20,855
I get it! There's a way...

28
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:23,155
What? If you came up with something,

29
00:01:23,155 --> 00:01:24,755
tell us about it.

30
00:01:24,755 --> 00:01:27,355
Huh?

31
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:30,555
The stop that this delivery truck made just before now

32
00:01:30,555 --> 00:01:32,555
was at Beika Condo in the third district.

33
00:01:32,555 --> 00:01:35,655
The two houses that they stopped at now was in the fourth district.

34
00:01:35,655 --> 00:01:37,055
So, the next stop would be?

35
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,855
The fifth district?

36
00:01:39,855 --> 00:01:41,455
Right.

37
00:01:41,455 --> 00:01:44,555
The territory of this cat, Tai.

38
00:01:44,555 --> 00:01:47,255
The fifth district is where he goes to beg for food

39
00:01:47,255 --> 00:01:49,555
at coffee shop Poirot.

40
00:01:49,555 --> 00:01:52,091
I see! You're going to make Tai go

41
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:54,093
and deliver a note that asks help for us!

42
00:01:54,255 --> 00:01:56,095
If we stick it in between its collar,

43
00:01:56,095 --> 00:01:58,655
I'm sure Azusa will notice it!

44
00:01:58,655 --> 00:02:00,455
Let's do it!

45
00:02:00,455 --> 00:02:01,755
Yeah.

46
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:03,455
But...

47
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:07,355
But, if those two men catch Tai

48
00:02:07,355 --> 00:02:09,355
and see the paper attached to its collar...

49
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:11,755
I've already figured that part out too.

50
00:02:11,755 --> 00:02:13,555
Huh?

51
00:02:13,555 --> 00:02:15,755
I'll think up a code that they won't figure out

52
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:18,117
even if they were to see it.

53
00:02:31,355 --> 00:02:33,155
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

54
00:02:33,155 --> 00:02:35,155
are slashed by the light of deduction.

55
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,655
The code that divides the fate of the Detective Squad.

56
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:38,855
Where will the code memo be delivered to?

57
00:02:38,855 --> 00:02:40,455
He sees through the one and only truth.

58
00:02:40,455 --> 00:02:42,141
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

59
00:02:42,355 --> 00:02:45,355
His name is Detective Conan!

60
00:04:14,244 --> 00:04:20,239
"A Sweet, Cold Courier (Part 2)"

61
00:04:23,144 --> 00:04:25,044
A code?

62
00:04:25,044 --> 00:04:26,244
Listen.

63
00:04:26,244 --> 00:04:30,249
The taxi receipt that Mitsuhiko had is thermal paper.

64
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:31,544
Words are written not by ink

65
00:04:31,544 --> 00:04:34,944
but by changing the color of the words to black using heat.

66
00:04:34,944 --> 00:04:36,744
On the surface of the thermal paper,

67
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:39,144
there is a chemical that becomes the base of the color black

68
00:04:39,144 --> 00:04:42,261
and an acidic chemical called color former.

69
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:44,263
This color former melts with the heat

70
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:46,265
and reacts to the other chemical

71
00:04:46,444 --> 00:04:49,744
making the color black emerge.

72
00:04:49,744 --> 00:04:54,273
The ammonia that is in the anti-itching ointment that Genta had

73
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:57,244
is alkaline and neutralizes acid.

74
00:04:57,244 --> 00:04:59,144
Putting this on this cotton swab,

75
00:04:59,144 --> 00:05:01,044
and tracing the top part of the letter A

76
00:05:01,044 --> 00:05:04,744
in the word Card that is written on the receipt...

77
00:05:06,844 --> 00:05:09,644
The letter A changed to the letter O!

78
00:05:09,644 --> 00:05:10,744
Really!

79
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,644
You're a genius, Conan!

80
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:14,044
Next...

81
00:05:14,044 --> 00:05:18,297
From this word Card Purchases,

82
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:20,299
erase a part of the letter A,

83
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:21,644
and the letter D in the word Card,

84
00:05:21,644 --> 00:05:22,844
then from the word Purchases,

85
00:05:22,844 --> 00:05:26,305
erase the letters U, R, C, H, A

86
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:28,944
and the last letter S...

87
00:05:28,944 --> 00:05:30,309
This results in the word Corpse

88
00:05:30,544 --> 00:05:32,311
which means dead body.

89
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:37,144
And by strategically erasing part

90
00:05:37,144 --> 00:05:39,444
the card number and phone number that are displayed below,

91
00:05:39,444 --> 00:05:42,321
we can inform people that a corpse is inside

92
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:46,044
and the license plate number of this refrigerated vehicle.

93
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:48,044
Conan, you're terrific!

94
00:05:48,044 --> 00:05:50,744
Then we fold this

95
00:05:50,744 --> 00:05:53,244
and stick it between Tai's collar.

96
00:05:53,244 --> 00:05:55,544
This way, even if Tai is caught by the men

97
00:05:55,544 --> 00:05:57,844
and they notice this receipt,

98
00:05:57,844 --> 00:05:59,844
they'll probably think it's a misprint,

99
00:05:59,844 --> 00:06:02,044
or that it scraped against something

100
00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:03,844
and the letters rubbed off.

101
00:06:03,844 --> 00:06:04,944
I see.

102
00:06:04,944 --> 00:06:07,044
This is perfect.

103
00:06:07,044 --> 00:06:08,844
Just as expected of you.

104
00:06:10,344 --> 00:06:13,044
Rats! The car's going to stop!

105
00:06:13,044 --> 00:06:14,353
Listen Tai.

106
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:17,244
Whether we make it or not depends on you.

107
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,844
Make sure you succeed this mission, okay?

108
00:06:27,744 --> 00:06:29,344
A cat...

109
00:06:29,344 --> 00:06:31,644
A cat's in the refrigerated compartment?

110
00:06:31,644 --> 00:06:35,644
It probably snuck in when you left the door open.

111
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:41,944
So, the cry that I heard a while ago was this cat's.

112
00:06:43,144 --> 00:06:45,144
Huh? There's a piece of paper by its collar.

113
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:48,387
Huh? A receipt?

114
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:50,389
-What? -Oh no.

115
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:53,544
Hey...

116
00:06:54,944 --> 00:06:57,544
Heck! It got away.

117
00:06:57,544 --> 00:06:59,544
Never mind the cat.

118
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,944
Yeah.

119
00:07:05,844 --> 00:07:07,944
Let's leave the rest up to Tai.

120
00:07:07,944 --> 00:07:09,944
Right...

121
00:07:09,944 --> 00:07:12,044
Hey...

122
00:07:12,044 --> 00:07:14,413
If that cat's going to Poirot,

123
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:17,044
that code's going to be seen by him too?

124
00:07:17,044 --> 00:07:19,144
Yeah, to put it more accurately,

125
00:07:19,144 --> 00:07:21,944
I made that code to show it to him!

126
00:07:21,944 --> 00:07:24,423
I'm sure that he'll get the message right away,

127
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:27,344
because he's Bourbon,

128
00:07:27,344 --> 00:07:29,844
a member of the organization of the men in black.

129
00:07:29,844 --> 00:07:33,344
"Poirot Coffee"

130
00:07:34,844 --> 00:07:37,344
Oh, Tai. You're late today.

131
00:07:44,244 --> 00:07:46,444
Enjoy to your heart's content.

132
00:07:46,444 --> 00:07:48,844
What's this?

133
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:51,844
There's something attached to the collar.

134
00:07:51,844 --> 00:07:54,744
A taxi receipt?

135
00:07:54,744 --> 00:07:56,444
Azusa.

136
00:07:56,444 --> 00:07:58,457
The shop master's calling you.

137
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:00,044
Thank you.

138
00:08:00,044 --> 00:08:03,344
That's right, you're a detective aren't you, Amuro?

139
00:08:03,344 --> 00:08:05,344
Huh? Yes, I guess.

140
00:08:05,344 --> 00:08:07,944
Then, would you have any idea what this is?

141
00:08:11,944 --> 00:08:14,044
What was that?

142
00:08:14,044 --> 00:08:17,144
Oh, well, it was nothing really.

143
00:08:17,144 --> 00:08:18,944
Is that so?

144
00:08:27,544 --> 00:08:30,044
It's cold.

145
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:32,844
That's the last for the seventh district of Beikacho.

146
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:35,944
Make sure they remember your face and name, now.

147
00:08:35,944 --> 00:08:37,944
Okay.

148
00:08:37,944 --> 00:08:40,499
We're just about to return to the second district

149
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:42,501
to deliver a time-specified box.

150
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:46,505
We can return the corpse to its home in the first district.

151
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:52,844
Hey, Conan.

152
00:08:52,844 --> 00:08:55,844
It's been a while since the cat left,

153
00:08:55,844 --> 00:08:58,144
but nobody's coming to rescue us.

154
00:08:58,144 --> 00:09:01,244
Maybe that code was too difficult after all?

155
00:09:01,244 --> 00:09:06,144
Or, maybe the paper with the code on it came off partway.

156
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:09,044
So, what are we going to do?

157
00:09:09,044 --> 00:09:11,344
The boxes to be delivered are decreasing

158
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:13,744
and we'll have no place to hide anymore.

159
00:09:13,744 --> 00:09:16,244
-Huh? -True!

160
00:09:19,044 --> 00:09:24,244
Hey, can't you do something about that twosome

161
00:09:24,244 --> 00:09:27,444
using your tranquilizer gun or your Super Kick shoe?

162
00:09:27,444 --> 00:09:30,549
I thought about that, first thing

163
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:32,551
but the battery's nearly dead

164
00:09:32,744 --> 00:09:34,844
and the voltage has gone down because of this cold,

165
00:09:34,844 --> 00:09:36,544
so it won't budge an inch.

166
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:40,559
Mitsuhiko, are you okay?

167
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,344
You've been quiet for a while, but are you okay?

168
00:09:43,344 --> 00:09:44,563
Yes.

169
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:48,567
It seems I've somehow managed to overcome the cold.

170
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:51,244
I've stopped shivering too.

171
00:09:51,244 --> 00:09:54,573
Hey! That's bad!

172
00:09:56,144 --> 00:10:00,144
Mitsuhiko...

173
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:02,581
He's experiencing disorientation of the brain

174
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:04,244
due to hypothermia.

175
00:10:04,244 --> 00:10:07,144
Moreover, his fingertips are turning purple

176
00:10:07,144 --> 00:10:09,044
and he's on the verge of getting frostbite.

177
00:10:09,044 --> 00:10:10,244
No joke!

178
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:13,544
Mitsuhiko lent his jacket to Haibara

179
00:10:13,544 --> 00:10:15,744
and was only wearing a t-shirt.

180
00:10:15,744 --> 00:10:17,244
Mitsuhiko!

181
00:10:17,244 --> 00:10:18,597
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

182
00:10:18,844 --> 00:10:20,599
Get a hold of yourself!

183
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:23,644
Mitsuhiko...

184
00:10:28,884 --> 00:10:32,384
Huh? The words on the taxi receipt were erased?

185
00:10:32,384 --> 00:10:35,984
Is that what you were about to show me a while ago?

186
00:10:35,984 --> 00:10:37,184
Yes.

187
00:10:37,184 --> 00:10:42,284
If I remember correctly, the letters between COR, P, SE were erased,

188
00:10:42,284 --> 00:10:45,184
so I thought it was a misprint.

189
00:10:45,184 --> 00:10:49,384
Corpse...

190
00:10:49,384 --> 00:10:50,629
Dead body.

191
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,984
Who knows that the cat comes here ever day

192
00:10:54,984 --> 00:10:56,635
to beg for food?

193
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:59,084
Since it started coming around quite recently,

194
00:10:59,084 --> 00:11:02,641
the ones who know are the shop master, you and I.

195
00:11:02,884 --> 00:11:05,384
And, Conan...

196
00:11:05,384 --> 00:11:09,384
Conan Edogawa knows too?

197
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:15,784
And, when I took the receipt, I touched the collar,

198
00:11:15,784 --> 00:11:17,884
but it seemed to be pretty cold.

199
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:24,284
About the receipt,

200
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,984
if I remember correctly, it blew over that way, didn't it?

201
00:11:26,984 --> 00:11:30,669
Yes? You mean you're going to look for it?

202
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:32,671
Please tell the shop master that I suddenly started feeling sick,

203
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:35,184
so left for home early.

204
00:11:35,184 --> 00:11:37,284
And also that he doesn't have to pay me for today.

205
00:11:37,284 --> 00:11:38,384
Oh, okay.

206
00:11:41,884 --> 00:11:43,684
Judging from the velocity and direction of the wind

207
00:11:43,684 --> 00:11:44,984
and making a simulation taking into consideration

208
00:11:44,984 --> 00:11:47,884
the position of the buildings around here,

209
00:11:47,884 --> 00:11:49,684
I could read the flow of the wind,

210
00:11:49,684 --> 00:11:52,284
and can probably narrow down where it flew off to.

211
00:11:54,884 --> 00:11:56,695
Mitsuhiko!

212
00:11:56,695 --> 00:12:00,184
Please... Mitsuhiko, get up!

213
00:12:00,184 --> 00:12:01,884
Mitsuhiko!

214
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,084
He got up!

215
00:12:07,084 --> 00:12:09,384
I...

216
00:12:09,384 --> 00:12:10,709
I'm sorry.

217
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:11,784
Huh?

218
00:12:11,784 --> 00:12:15,184
That you're going through this just because of me.

219
00:12:15,184 --> 00:12:18,717
Stay still. I'll warm you up right now.

220
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:21,684
Okay, thank you so very much.

221
00:12:21,684 --> 00:12:23,984
But, with all of you in that state,

222
00:12:23,984 --> 00:12:26,484
we could never run for it even if we wanted to.

223
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:30,729
Darn, we were supposed to be eating delicious cake by now

224
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:32,284
at Doc's house.

225
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,733
He said it was cake coming from a cake shop in Yokohama.

226
00:12:34,984 --> 00:12:36,735
Yokohama?

227
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,384
Is the cake that's supposed to arrive at Doc's house

228
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:40,184
from a shop in Yokohama?

229
00:12:40,184 --> 00:12:42,741
Yes, it seems he specified the time of delivery

230
00:12:42,984 --> 00:12:45,184
to match the time we would be there.

231
00:12:45,184 --> 00:12:49,184
But, today we were able to make it back early from school.

232
00:12:51,684 --> 00:12:53,284
Those guys were saying a while ago

233
00:12:53,284 --> 00:12:54,753
that they would be returning to the second district

234
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:57,384
to make a time-specified delivery.

235
00:12:57,384 --> 00:12:59,884
Conan, if you touch it too much,

236
00:12:59,884 --> 00:13:00,759
they'll find out!

237
00:13:02,384 --> 00:13:03,684
I found it.

238
00:13:03,684 --> 00:13:06,084
The cake that's supposed to be delivered to Doc's house.

239
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:09,084
Oh! Are we eating it now?

240
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:12,771
Idiot. We're going to put a message in it.

241
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:14,184
Huh?

242
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:16,775
By using the ball pen that Mitsuhiko had,

243
00:13:16,984 --> 00:13:19,784
and Ayumi's cotton swab.

244
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:23,584
If you're planning to write something on the box,

245
00:13:23,584 --> 00:13:25,984
I don't think you should, Conan.

246
00:13:25,984 --> 00:13:28,484
If the two men find out...

247
00:13:28,484 --> 00:13:30,789
Besides, it'll work only

248
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:33,184
if Doc sees the message right away.

249
00:13:33,184 --> 00:13:35,984
Don't worry, he'll notice it right away.

250
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:39,784
We're not delivering it to Doc.

251
00:13:39,784 --> 00:13:40,784
Huh?

252
00:13:47,784 --> 00:13:49,784
Just as I thought. It was around here after all.

253
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:53,784
The number that is displayed at the bottom of the word Corpse

254
00:13:53,784 --> 00:13:55,984
is most likely the license plate number.

255
00:13:55,984 --> 00:13:58,384
If the cat's collar was cold,

256
00:13:58,384 --> 00:14:00,819
the thing thinkable is a freezer vehicle,

257
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:03,484
but vehicles that are used for special purposes like this,

258
00:14:03,484 --> 00:14:06,825
have license plate numbers that begin with the number eight.

259
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:09,784
But this isn't an eight number.

260
00:14:09,784 --> 00:14:14,833
Which means, it's mostly likely a refrigerated courier truck.

261
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,484
With all this information so far...

262
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:21,684
Huh? Where's the Kudo residence?

263
00:14:21,684 --> 00:14:24,084
Huh, Kudo?

264
00:14:24,084 --> 00:14:25,484
What're you talking about?

265
00:14:25,484 --> 00:14:26,845
The time-specified delivery

266
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:28,384
is for the Agasa residence, isn't it?

267
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:30,849
But, look! At this delivery slip.

268
00:14:31,084 --> 00:14:32,084
Huh?

269
00:14:32,084 --> 00:14:33,184
Before the name Agasa,

270
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:36,855
it says care of the Kudo residence.

271
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:40,284
Strange, it doesn't say so on this side.

272
00:14:40,284 --> 00:14:42,861
Oh! This house seems to be it.

273
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:47,284
Yes.

274
00:14:47,284 --> 00:14:50,884
Cheeta Courier.

275
00:14:50,884 --> 00:14:54,284
Is there a Mr. Hiroshi Agasa there?

276
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:57,484
Mr. Agasa lives next door.

277
00:14:57,484 --> 00:14:59,184
Well, I came to deliver a box

278
00:14:59,184 --> 00:15:03,184
that says Mr. Hiroshi Agasa care of the Kudo residence.

279
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:08,584
I remember, it's cake, isn't it?

280
00:15:08,584 --> 00:15:10,184
Since he's in the room next door

281
00:15:10,184 --> 00:15:12,384
and his hands are tied right now,

282
00:15:12,384 --> 00:15:13,984
I'll take it.

283
00:15:15,884 --> 00:15:18,897
What? You wrote in care of the Kudo residence

284
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,684
before the name Dr. Agasa?

285
00:15:21,684 --> 00:15:23,484
And with a ball point pen too?

286
00:15:23,484 --> 00:15:26,905
Yeah. So, the box is supposed to be delivered not to Doc,

287
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:30,909
but to Subaru who is next door at the Kudo residence.

288
00:15:32,184 --> 00:15:36,915
And? It's okay that he's going to receive the box,

289
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:40,184
but how did you relay to him this crisis we're facing?

290
00:15:41,184 --> 00:15:42,921
Think about it.

291
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:44,584
I'm the only one in this world

292
00:15:44,584 --> 00:15:46,925
who could write an address like that, right?

293
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:49,984
Besides if you take a good look at the font and its color,

294
00:15:49,984 --> 00:15:53,484
Subaru would be able to tell right away

295
00:15:53,484 --> 00:15:55,584
that the words have been added on at a later time with a ball point pen.

296
00:15:55,584 --> 00:15:58,284
He'll also see through that something like

297
00:15:58,284 --> 00:16:00,084
that can only be done

298
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:03,284
from inside the back compartment of a courier truck.

299
00:16:03,284 --> 00:16:04,943
I see.

300
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:06,584
That's amazing.

301
00:16:06,584 --> 00:16:09,984
Well, just in case, I wrote down the circumstances

302
00:16:09,984 --> 00:16:12,384
on that delivery slip too.

303
00:16:12,384 --> 00:16:14,953
Huh? But, doing something like that

304
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:16,484
would give us away right away!

305
00:16:16,484 --> 00:16:17,884
Don't worry.

306
00:16:17,884 --> 00:16:20,484
Because I wrote it after taking the cotton off this swab.

307
00:16:20,484 --> 00:16:21,584
Huh?

308
00:16:21,584 --> 00:16:24,184
You could never write with something like that!

309
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:26,965
That's what you think.

310
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:28,967
The delivery slip is made of several layers of paper

311
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:30,384
which includes a copy for the sender

312
00:16:30,384 --> 00:16:32,971
and an item label.

313
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:34,684
If you write on the very top slip,

314
00:16:34,684 --> 00:16:37,784
all the papers under it will be carbon copied.

315
00:16:37,784 --> 00:16:43,384
So if I pull out the item received slip that the deliveryman would take out

316
00:16:43,384 --> 00:16:46,984
after having it signed by the recipient

317
00:16:46,984 --> 00:16:49,484
and write from on top of it,

318
00:16:49,484 --> 00:16:52,991
then put the item received slip back together with the delivery slip

319
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,484
nobody will notice what I have written

320
00:16:55,484 --> 00:16:57,784
on the now bottom-most slip, the recipient's copy,

321
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:01,284
until Subaru flips the item label over.

322
00:17:03,284 --> 00:17:05,484
Then, are you saying that those two men

323
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:07,984
are being beaten up by Subaru now?

324
00:17:07,984 --> 00:17:10,484
No, if I know Subaru...

325
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:16,384
Hey, why are opening the door again?

326
00:17:16,384 --> 00:17:17,784
The one I delivered the box to a while ago

327
00:17:17,784 --> 00:17:20,384
asked me to collect a box from him.

328
00:17:20,384 --> 00:17:23,284
Well, since it's a small box, it's okay, right?

329
00:17:23,284 --> 00:17:25,023
I guess so.

330
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,031
Hey...

331
00:17:33,284 --> 00:17:34,484
Conan.

332
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:41,584
Just as I thought.

333
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:43,384
A cell phone?

334
00:17:43,384 --> 00:17:44,784
I see.

335
00:17:44,784 --> 00:17:48,084
In this situation, that would be the best weapon.

336
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:49,384
Yeah.

337
00:17:49,384 --> 00:17:53,051
In order to safely yet surely nab them,

338
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:57,055
it would be best to relay this information directly to the police myself.

339
00:17:58,584 --> 00:18:00,384
No, you're not.

340
00:18:02,184 --> 00:18:05,384
Since the position of the boxes were slightly moved from a while ago,

341
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:07,484
I decided to check,

342
00:18:07,484 --> 00:18:10,184
and found all you petty thieves aside from that cat.

343
00:18:10,184 --> 00:18:13,684
More so, there are five of you.

344
00:18:13,684 --> 00:18:15,584
I... I told you that...

345
00:18:15,584 --> 00:18:17,484
I heard voices of children.

346
00:18:17,484 --> 00:18:19,077
Yeah, sorry.

347
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:21,784
But, what stupid kids,

348
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:24,384
all they had to do was call the police right away.

349
00:18:24,384 --> 00:18:27,784
And just what are you going to do about these kids?

350
00:18:27,784 --> 00:18:30,084
What else?

351
00:18:30,084 --> 00:18:31,884
After we take their cell phone away,

352
00:18:31,884 --> 00:18:35,584
we'll lock them up in here till they freeze to death.

353
00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:39,084
If we line the bodies of the kids next to the man,

354
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:42,384
it's sure to be a cold case difficult to solve.

355
00:18:42,384 --> 00:18:46,684
After all, we and the kids have no connection to each other at all.

356
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:48,684
I guess so.

357
00:18:56,384 --> 00:18:58,884
Excuse me! Since this alley is small,

358
00:18:58,884 --> 00:19:01,119
could you yield the way please?

359
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:03,121
I don't want to hurt you or the car, you see.

360
00:19:03,284 --> 00:19:05,123
-Oh... -Right away.

361
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:06,784
Detective Amuro!

362
00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:08,884
Help!

363
00:19:08,884 --> 00:19:11,784
What're you guys doing

364
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:12,884
in a place like that?

365
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:15,484
No... well, this is you see...

366
00:19:15,484 --> 00:19:18,484
You... do you know these brats?

367
00:19:18,484 --> 00:19:21,139
Yes, I do.

368
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:23,984
Now that you've witnessed this, I've got no choice.

369
00:19:23,984 --> 00:19:26,084
If you don't want me to kill the kids,

370
00:19:26,084 --> 00:19:28,184
you get inside the refrigerated compartment too.

371
00:19:33,984 --> 00:19:35,484
I told you, didn't I?

372
00:19:35,484 --> 00:19:36,784
To yield the way

373
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:38,484
because I didn't want to hurt you.

374
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:44,784
Would you like me to take you on too?

375
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:47,984
No...

376
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:51,169
All right...

377
00:19:53,684 --> 00:19:57,175
Okay, Conan, report this to the police.

378
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:58,284
Okay.

379
00:20:04,184 --> 00:20:06,384
But, you're really something.

380
00:20:06,384 --> 00:20:10,084
You saw the code on the receipt and came, right?

381
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,284
Huh? A receipt?

382
00:20:12,284 --> 00:20:14,684
If you're talking about the queer receipt

383
00:20:14,684 --> 00:20:16,284
that was on the cat's collar,

384
00:20:16,284 --> 00:20:18,084
it was blown away by the wind

385
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,584
and I couldn't find it.

386
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:23,484
-Huh... -I just happened to pass by here.

387
00:20:23,484 --> 00:20:24,784
Is that all?

388
00:20:24,784 --> 00:20:27,205
Then, would you like to have cake over

389
00:20:27,384 --> 00:20:28,884
at Doc's house too, Mr. Detective?

390
00:20:30,184 --> 00:20:33,784
So this is the rumored Dr. Agasa's place.

391
00:20:33,784 --> 00:20:35,213
That...

392
00:20:36,684 --> 00:20:39,784
But, I don't think so today.

393
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:42,684
I've got other things to attend to besides.

394
00:20:44,584 --> 00:20:47,225
Please give my regards to Dr. Agasa, will you.

395
00:22:20,084 --> 00:22:21,784
I see.

396
00:22:21,784 --> 00:22:23,884
What a catastrophe it was.

397
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,984
I was so cold,

398
00:22:25,984 --> 00:22:29,084
that I thought I'd be frozen stiff.

399
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:32,084
On top of that, Mitsuhiko fainted too.

400
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,331
What?

401
00:22:33,331 --> 00:22:35,684
But, he came to right away

402
00:22:35,684 --> 00:22:38,784
after Ai warmed him up, right?

403
00:22:38,784 --> 00:22:40,484
Thanks for that.

404
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,341
But, the culprits were caught, weren't they?

405
00:22:43,584 --> 00:22:44,584
Yep!

406
00:22:44,584 --> 00:22:46,984
Amuro who is part-timing at Poirot,

407
00:22:46,984 --> 00:22:49,347
beat the culprits up, you see.

408
00:22:49,584 --> 00:22:51,784
Amuro did?

409
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:54,284
-Yes! -He was awesome, wasn't he?

410
00:22:54,284 --> 00:22:55,984
Yeah.

411
00:22:55,984 --> 00:22:59,357
Never mind that. Let's eat the cake...

412
00:22:59,357 --> 00:23:01,884
Oh! That's right...

413
00:23:01,884 --> 00:23:04,584
I forgot the main thing.

414
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:07,365
Cake...

415
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:10,984
It's an exclusive Christmas cake on sale

416
00:23:10,984 --> 00:23:12,884
for a limited time only from a cake shop in Yokohama.

417
00:23:16,184 --> 00:23:18,784
Remember this when you eat it.

418
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,384
Here goes...

419
00:23:27,384 --> 00:23:29,084
What's this?

420
00:23:31,784 --> 00:23:35,393
That's a limited time only cake, right down the drain.

421
00:23:35,393 --> 00:23:37,784
Come to think of it, those culprits were saying that

422
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:39,384
they would deliberately drop the boxes they deliver,

423
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:42,484
in order to have their faces remembered.
