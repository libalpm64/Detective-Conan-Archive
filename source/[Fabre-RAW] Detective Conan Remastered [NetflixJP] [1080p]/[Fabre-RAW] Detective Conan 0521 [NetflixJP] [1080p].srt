1
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,680
"Murderer Shinichi Kudo"

2
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,290
Hey, are you all right, Conan?

3
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,090
I'm fine.

4
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,490
I drank the cold medicine that Dr. Agasa gave me.

5
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,690
But, your voice sounds terrible.

6
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:56,790
I think it's better we head back

7
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,390
and I take care of you at home.

8
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,390
He'll be just fine.

9
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:05,490
That wonder drug that was given to the brat a while ago,

10
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,490
will soon cure him.

11
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,490
What wonder drug?

12
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,090
Hey, don't tell me it's that Chinese liquor called Baikaru

13
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,090
that you brought with you

14
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,690
when you first visited my detective agency?

15
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:21,690
No, no.

16
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,690
It's medicine that's way more effective than liquor.

17
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,190
Right, boy?

18
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,990
I wonder if the person

19
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,690
that we're going to see is really okay.

20
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,590
"Mr. Heiji Hattori" -Because it said in the letter

21
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,290
that he wanted to talk to Shinichi.

22
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,090
Isn't the person going to be disappointed

23
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,790
if he finds that Shinichi's not with us?

24
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,790
Really?

25
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,190
Yes, something about that person

26
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,290
finding that Shinichi made a mistake in deducing

27
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,290
a murder case that he solved a year ago.

28
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,790
So the person wants to meet him and talk about it.

29
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,190
That's why, in consideration of that mistake in deduction,

30
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:58,990
we're going to reinvestigate the case and reveal the truth.

31
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,690
Well, I mailed Shinichi.

32
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,590
So he just might decide to show up.

33
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,890
Shinichi might come?

34
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:12,890
But, why would the guy send the letter to you?

35
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,990
Of course because I'm Shinichi's best friend.

36
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,490
Well, even if he did try to contact me by mail or phone,

37
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,690
I'm not living here now anyway.

38
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:24,990
So, he probably got impatient

39
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,190
and decided send mail to high school detective Heiji Hattori,

40
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,090
since he's in the same profession.

41
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,890
But, what's this about a mistake in deduction?

42
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,990
If I'm not mistaken the sender was...

43
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,190
It's a letter from a man called Makoto Okuda

44
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,490
who lives in a place called East Okuho Village

45
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,090
on the outskirts of Okuho-cho.

46
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,090
You know him, don't you?

47
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,990
Yes. I think it's the young man who helped us

48
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,490
when we investigated the murder case

49
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,390
that occurred in that village.

50
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,290
Do you have a cold?

51
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,290
Well, I'll take the letter that's addressed to you

52
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,790
that's enclosed together with mine when I go over,

53
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,790
so read it well, okay?

54
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,490
"Shinichi Kudo" -I'll bet it's filled with foul remarks

55
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,290
about your deduction,

56
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,690
but it'll be great stimulus to get rid of that cold of yours.

57
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,690
The only case I can recall

58
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,790
that occurred in East Okuho Village is...

59
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,390
A mistake in deduction?

60
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,090
It sure bugs me.

61
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,190
A crisis is gracefully revived.

62
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,190
The table is turned and the mystery solved.

63
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,390
Shinichi loses his memory and is not himself.

64
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,490
He cannot deduce the case together with Heiji.

65
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,190
He sees through the one and only truth.

66
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,090
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

67
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,190
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

68
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,980
"Murderer Shinichi Kudo"

69
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,180
What? His whereabouts is unknown?

70
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,380
Are you serious?

71
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,480
"Residents Division" -Yes.

72
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,680
A missing persons search was out for him six months ago.

73
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,280
Well, Makoto always wanted to go to the city anyway.

74
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,280
"Makoto Okuda (19)" -The villagers say

75
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,080
that he probably left home for the city

76
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,680
and is part-timing or something there.

77
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,180
And? What do you want with Makoto Okuda?

78
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,080
I got a letter from him last week.

79
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,780
It said that he wants to talk

80
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,380
about the deduction mistake that was made by Shinichi Kudo

81
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,280
when he solved a murder case

82
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,680
that occurred in this village a year ago.

83
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,580
Who?

84
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,780
He asked me to bring Shinichi Kudo.

85
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,680
What this?

86
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
Liar!

87
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,080
You're friends of that liar, right?

88
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,280
Liar?

89
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,080
Hey, Sonny.

90
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,080
At any rate,

91
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,080
if you want to know about the case, go to the village police box.

92
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,280
We have nothing to tell you people.

93
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,180
What the heck did that high school brat detective do anyway?

94
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,180
Ran, haven't you heard anything from Shinichi?

95
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,180
No.

96
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,080
Where's Conan?

97
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,480
That brat said that he'd head off for the inn ahead of us.

98
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,880
I guess his cold got worse.

99
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,380
I'm going back to the inn too then.

100
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,480
I don't want to leave him there alone.

101
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,580
Well, I guess the truth is he didn't want to go there

102
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,580
and have to face me pointing out his deduction mistake.

103
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,180
Dear Mr. Shinichi Kudo,

104
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,980
I've found evidence that there was a mistake in your deduction.

105
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,280
I suggest that we should talk things out just the two of us,

106
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,180
so you can save face as a detective.

107
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,180
I'd like to see you at the mountain hut

108
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,880
where we both first ran into each other.

109
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,380
Makoto Okuda.

110
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,680
Excuse me.

111
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,880
The cold medicine that doctor got me

112
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,280
isn't making me feel better at all.

113
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,180
Are you Shinichi Kudo?

114
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,480
His voice is changed.

115
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,580
Who is it?

116
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,680
The door is locked.

117
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,980
Hey, wait! Hey!

118
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,380
Darn, my throat...

119
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,880
I've lost my voice because of this cold.

120
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,580
The window...

121
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,280
and door as well...

122
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,580
I've got to find an escape route.

123
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,180
This thing I'm feeling...

124
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,280
It can't be...

125
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,880
Doctor, did you see the bottle of medicine

126
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,980
that I had way inside the drawer?

127
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,280
You mean that cold medicine.

128
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,380
The container was that of cold medicine,

129
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,380
but the content is the medicine that I made.

130
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,380
What?

131
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,980
Don't tell me you drank it?

132
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,180
No. Well...

133
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,180
Bummers.

134
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,780
I've got to get out of here fast.

135
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:34,680
What? It was a prototype anecdote for APTX 4869?

136
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,480
Yes, that's right.

137
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,580
I made it thinking to secretly try it on him

138
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,280
when he comes to spend the night here next time.

139
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,480
That medicine was the miracle drug

140
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,780
that could maybe change his body that had become that of a child

141
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,980
to the body of a high school student that it used to be.

142
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,080
You've got to call him quick.

143
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,680
If he transforms into his original body in front of everyone,

144
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,180
we can't afford that to happen.

145
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,080
Conan is not back at the inn yet?

146
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,680
No. I asked a villager

147
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,980
and was told that he saw a boy wearing glasses

148
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,180
go into the forest alone.

149
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,280
Then, why don't you call him on his cell phone?

150
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,380
"Out of service"

151
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,580
No good.

152
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,580
This place is out of service range.

153
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,680
What the heck is he doing?

154
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,080
And Conan has a cold too.

155
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,680
That troublemaker.

156
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,280
Sorry, officer.

157
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,880
We'll go to the site of the murder later.

158
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,480
Okay, see you later then.

159
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,580
Conan!

160
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,580
Where are you?

161
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,080
Come on out!

162
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,380
Don't tell me that he...

163
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,880
that something was written on that letter addressed to him,

164
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,680
and he was summoned to go to some strange place?

165
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,780
Hey, did you hear about it?

166
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,880
What's up?

167
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,980
A stark naked man was afloat in the lake.

168
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,680
Yes. I heard.

169
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,580
My mom just took a blanket over.

170
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,180
Hey.

171
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,480
It wasn't an elementary school kid, was it?

172
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,780
No.

173
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,980
It was a young man,

174
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,680
probably a high school student or something.

175
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,980
-High... -High school student?

176
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,480
Over there, over there.

177
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,880
It's that man wrapped in a blanket.

178
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,380
Shinichi?

179
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,680
Shinichi!

180
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,680
Why? Why are you here, Shinichi?

181
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,380
Shinichi...

182
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,080
Is that my name?

183
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,580
Shinichi?

184
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,120
What kind of nonsense are you saying?

185
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,920
You're the high school detective of the East, Shinichi Kudo.

186
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,220
Talking funny like that isn't making anybody laugh.

187
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,620
Detective?

188
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,370
Don't tell me that Shinichi...

189
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,370
Lost his memory?

190
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,370
I don't know

191
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:47,370
who I am or where I am.

192
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,370
Shinichi?

193
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,570
Hey, isn't this the guy, Shinichi Kudo?

194
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,170
If so, we shouldn't have rescued him.

195
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,970
Hey, watch your mouth.

196
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,470
Could you lend me something to wear?

197
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,070
I don't seem to have any clothes on.

198
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:12,170
Okay. I'll lend you my clothes.

199
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,770
Talk about a voice hoarse from a cold.

200
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,370
Just like Conan.

201
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,370
That's right, we've got to find Conan quick.

202
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,870
No, I don't think we need to worry about him.

203
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,970
Well, the thing is...

204
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,770
What?

205
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,170
He took the train and left for home?

206
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,770
All by himself?

207
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:37,770
Yes.

208
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,170
I'd completely forgotten that he told me so

209
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,070
before we went to the town office.

210
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,570
He said he didn't want his cold to get worse,

211
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,570
so he wanted to go on home.

212
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,670
But, there's nobody back at the office.

213
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,970
I'm sure that he told me

214
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,370
that he was going to stay over at old man Agasa's place

215
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,770
or something.

216
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:58,470
What's your problem talking like that?

217
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,770
I said I just simply forgot.

218
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:06,570
At any rate, this place is out of service range,

219
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,170
so if we want to check on the whereabouts of that brat,

220
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:12,170
we've got to go back to the inn where there's a phone.

221
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,070
We're taking this troublesome detective brat

222
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:17,070
that forgot everything with us too.

223
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,070
Forget about trying to put sense back into him.

224
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,970
I'm sure he met the you know what in the forest.

225
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,570
-You know what of the forest? -What a scare, scare...

226
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,770
Hey, hold it you!

227
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,870
What do you know about the forest?

228
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,170
You look pretty good in Heiji's clothes.

229
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,570
Don't you think so, Ran?

230
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,770
Where's Ran?

231
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,870
It seems that Ran's more worried about the glasses brat

232
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,270
than that high school detective.

233
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,570
What? You gave me the wrong medicine?

234
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,370
Don't tell me you gave me the medicine

235
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,170
that the little lady made at the school festival?

236
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,370
Yes, that's right.

237
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,970
It's the antidote for APTX 4869

238
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,670
that shrunk Shinichi's body.

239
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,370
In other words, it's a drug that will return his body

240
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,470
to that of a high school student that he originally was.

241
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:31,170
I mistook that drug that Ai made for cold medicine

242
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,770
and carelessly gave it to you.

243
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,570
I mean gramps, careless is not the word for it.

244
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,570
By the way,

245
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:39,570
is it true that Shinichi has lost his memory?

246
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,570
Yes, it seems he doesn't remember anything.

247
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,370
Well, I guess it's better for him that way, though.

248
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,970
I mean with his original body from here on now,

249
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,470
it'll be more convenient for him and all I guess.

250
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,170
Stupid.

251
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,470
That drug is only a prototype.

252
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,470
There may be a slight discrepancy

253
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,070
but the longest the effect will continue is more or less 24 hours.

254
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,470
Twenty four hours?

255
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,370
You've got to make sure he regains his memory by then

256
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,770
or else we're in big trouble.

257
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,470
Why? If it's his memory,

258
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,270
we can work on it slowly after he becomes small again.

259
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,770
What are you saying?

260
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,370
If two people get amnesia at the same time,

261
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,770
no matter how dense, it'll be more than obvious

262
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:21,070
that the two are one and the same.

263
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,070
Especially her.

264
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,170
True.

265
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,370
If that should happen,

266
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,070
I'm sure she'll find out

267
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:32,670
what's going on no matter what.

268
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,670
About who made him drink the drug and for what.

269
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,170
I wonder if she'd be able to hold the truth

270
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:39,570
that she finds out about all within herself?

271
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,870
Well, in order not to corner her

272
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,270
into a dangerous predicament like we're in,

273
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,570
will you please bring him back here

274
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,870
before he turns back into a child again?

275
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,470
I'll take care of everything else here.

276
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,370
Okay, you can count on me.

277
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,170
Heiji, what's all the whispering about?

278
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,670
Please put me on the phone.

279
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,670
They hung up.

280
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,070
What?

281
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:06,170
Well, I was told that he drank medicine

282
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,170
and is fast asleep so not to worry.

283
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,870
Okay.

284
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,970
Okay then, let's eat dinner too and hit the sack right away.

285
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,670
After all, we've got to back to Beika-cho tomorrow.

286
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,270
I thought we were going to take it easy

287
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,670
and stay for 2 nights and three days?

288
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,170
The schedules been changed.

289
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,070
We've got to get Kudo to a doctor as soon as possible, right?

290
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:28,970
Let's take Shinichi to that murder site too then.

291
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,270
He may just remember something.

292
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,270
What the heck are you talking about?

293
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,470
Wait.

294
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,270
Maybe she's got a point there.

295
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,760
My god, what a mess!

296
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,260
The entire house is messed up.

297
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,360
"Officer Shiroyama (46)" -The room was left as is, since the incident,

298
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,160
in keeping with his wishes.

299
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,360
His?

300
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,160
Daiki who was staying over at a relative's house

301
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,560
and escaped disaster on the night of the incident a year ago.

302
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,460
He's the brat that we ran into at the town office.

303
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,660
Then, the two people who are in the picture on both sides of him are...

304
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:21,060
Daiki's parents who died because of that incident.

305
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:25,460
He's Mr. Takinori Hinohara, who was the village head back then

306
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,660
and his wife, Shoko.

307
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,260
Mr. Hinohara was a very cheerful person

308
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,660
"East Okuho Village Office" -and was liked by all the villagers.

309
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,160
He served as village head for more or less 20 years or so.

310
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,160
Therefore, that disaster that struck a year ago

311
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,160
really broke the hearts of the villagers.

312
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,860
And this is the aftermath of the incident?

313
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,960
These black footprints.

314
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,960
Yes. This is...

315
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,660
the blood of Mrs. Hinohara who was stabbed part way down the stairs

316
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,160
and stepped on by the murderer

317
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,960
which after he seems to have walked around the room

318
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,060
with his shoes on, leaving footprints behind.

319
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,760
How terrible.

320
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,660
These shoe prints continue on quite a long way

321
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,660
over to that veranda.

322
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,060
It sure is a spacious veranda.

323
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,760
The shoe prints return back from here.

324
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,260
I see.

325
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:28,760
So, the village head was made to fall over from here.

326
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,060
And? What about the murder weapon,

327
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,960
or was anything taken?

328
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,260
The knife that was the murder weapon wasn't found in the house,

329
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,760
but the jewelry and antiques were gone.

330
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,360
The only thing left behind were the bloody shoe prints.

331
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,060
The same shoe prints were found going from the back door

332
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:49,660
to the asphalt outside and then back.

333
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,860
Are you sure that those were the only shoe prints?

334
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,860
Yes.

335
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,960
It was raining until the day before the incident

336
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,360
and the ground was muddy, you see.

337
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,160
Which means that the armed robber after killing Mr. and Mrs. Hinohara,

338
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,260
made off with the jewel and valuables in the house

339
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,360
and fled by car.

340
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,460
And? Who did Kudo say the murderer was?

341
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,860
Don't tell me that he branded an innocent citizen

342
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,360
to be the armed robber.

343
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,360
No, well the thing is...

344
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,560
Double suicide.

345
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,360
Shinichi Kudo there deduced this case to be

346
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,560
a forced double suicide that Mr. Hinohara committed.

347
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,460
Forced double suicide?

348
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,860
By the way, who are you, young lady?

349
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,260
I'm the classmate of Makoto

350
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,860
who was staying over at this house after his parents passed away.

351
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:49,060
See, he's in that picture over there too,

352
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,760
behind the village head.

353
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,360
Hold it.

354
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,960
Makoto, you mean Makoto Okuda?

355
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,560
"Moegi Hikawa (19)" -Yes, that's right.

356
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,460
He, Makoto Okuda, discovered the corpses

357
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,460
and was the first to be suspected of being the murderer.

358
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,460
Well, on the day the murder was committed,

359
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,760
Makoto was staying over at a hotel in the city

360
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,460
to take the entrance exam for a university,

361
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,960
so he was cleared immediately.

362
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,460
And let me ask you,

363
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,660
where's that Makoto now?

364
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,560
He's the one who sent a letter asking for me to bring Kudo here

365
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,360
because he found that Kudo had made a mistake in deduction.

366
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,560
Yet his whereabouts are unknown?

367
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,860
What the heck is going on?

368
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,060
His whereabouts are not unknown.

369
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,260
He's probably been killed.

370
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,560
What?

371
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,960
Just what do you mean?

372
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,060
The people of this village say that Makoto is part-timing in the city,

373
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,960
but since he was adopted by this family,

374
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,260
he probably inherited a huge.

375
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:46,460
So, you're saying that somebody who wanted to take that money from him.

376
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,060
Yes. It's unthinkable

377
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:52,860
that Makoto would not get in touch with anyone for half a year.

378
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,260
Besides, the one who killed him

379
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,960
is probably that thing in the forest.

380
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,360
That thing in the forest?

381
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,060
If so, who for what reason sent me a letter like that?

382
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,560
What the heck is Kudo's deduction blooper?

383
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,860
The motive for Mr. Hinohara committing forced double suicide

384
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,060
was because his doctor declared that he had cancer

385
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,360
and he was full of despair.

386
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,560
The problem arose

387
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,860
when Mr. Kudo publicized the truth a year ago.

388
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,060
Who are you?

389
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,060
"Misato Kawauchi (36)" -I'm a reporter for Tohto News,

390
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,560
Misato Kawauchi.

391
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,960
I'm sorry,

392
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,860
I helped myself in because the door wasn't locked.

393
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,360
And? So, what was the problem?

394
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,360
Some days later,

395
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,460
a nurse at the hospital let it out with a slip of her tongue.

396
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,360
She told him that although he did have cancer, the tumor was benign

397
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,660
and it would be completely cured with surgery.

398
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,160
Hearing this, the he seemed very happy.

399
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,460
What?

400
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,060
Hey, Kudo. What the heck is going on?

401
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,060
Explain.

402
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,760
Kudo.

403
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
I don't know... I don't know anything.

404
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,960
I don't know what's going on.

405
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,260
Kudo.

406
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,860
I see.

407
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,660
I finally got it.

408
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,960
I understand now why the villagers don't like this detective kid.

409
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,060
Yes.

410
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,360
He's a horrendous villain who disgraced the village head

411
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,460
who was loved by everyone.

412
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,860
But, how frightening.

413
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,260
If that's true it means that the murderer

414
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,460
is still out there somewhere, right?

415
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,460
There's a rumor going around among the villagers

416
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:32,360
saying it's that you know who in the forest that's done it.

417
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,560
Hey, I heard that just a while ago.

418
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,760
But what the heck is it about?

419
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,660
Is there something in the forest?

420
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,060
It's folklore that's been relayed for generations in this village.

421
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,560
Folklore?

422
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,960
I remember frequently being told the folklore

423
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,660
when I was a child too.

424
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,960
I was told not to look at its eyes if I run into in the forest.

425
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,160
That if you don't look away, you'll be cursed

426
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,160
and become prey to Death.

427
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,160
Death?

428
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,460
What is it, Ran?

429
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,560
It's nothing.

430
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,260
I just felt a bit weird.

431
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,280
That stuff is just fairy tale.

432
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,980
True. The story about Death

433
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,080
is a story of the god of the district who protects the land

434
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,380
from those who dare mess around with it.

435
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,780
A folklore that is often heard of in rural areas.

436
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:45,080
That is until a young woman died in this lake...

437
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,280
9 years ago.

438
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,780
Oh no.

439
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,680
You mean something's really inside this forest?

440
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,180
Yes.

441
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,480
At sundown of the 3rd day

442
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,280
after the villagers went all out searching

443
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,280
for the young woman that never came back from the forest.

444
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,280
A rumor started going around among the tired villagers

445
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,980
that she'd been punished for breaking the rule

446
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,680
that had been set from ancient times

447
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,180
by entering the forest at night and angered Death,

448
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,680
the guardian of the forest.

449
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,980
The father of the young lady who heard this rumor

450
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,180
ignored all those who tried to stop him,

451
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:26,380
went into the forest just around sundown

452
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,080
to look for her and never came back.

453
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,080
It was two days later

454
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,180
that the people found the corpse of the young lady

455
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,280
who had slipped into the lake and drowned.

456
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,080
If I'm not mistaken her name was...

457
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,580
Tamako Okuda.

458
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,380
Okuda?

459
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,680
Right.

460
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,780
She was the younger sister of Makoto Okuda

461
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,980
who you said sent you a letter.

462
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,580
Then, the father who you mentioned

463
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,080
went into the forest to search for her was...

464
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,080
Yes. Makoto's father.

465
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,080
He hasn't been found to this day.

466
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,880
Maybe Makoto's father was also fell prey to Death.

467
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,480
But I wonder if it's credible to conclude

468
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,480
that an imaginary figure committed the crime,

469
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,580
just by the information that we have now.

470
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,680
I didn't believe the story at first either.

471
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,380
But...

472
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,180
I saw it.

473
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,680
I saw the white haired monster hiding on top of a tree

474
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,480
inside the crimson forest at sundown,

475
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,280
with its teeth showing and sneering.

476
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,580
What?

477
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,880
Maybe you mistook a monkey or something for it.

478
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,880
It wasn't a monkey.

479
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,480
A person from the town office said that he saw it just last week.

480
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,580
But, it's strange?

481
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:44,080
Why would the village and his wife be killed by that monster?

482
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,180
Did he go into the forest at night?

483
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,180
The redevelopment of the village.

484
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,580
Mr. Hinohara was planning to build

485
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,080
a large tourist facility in the forest.

486
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,480
I see.

487
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,480
That's why he angered Death.

488
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,280
Yes, therefore, the plan went down the drain.

489
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,380
As for the hero of this village, Hinohara,

490
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,780
all he was trying to do was do something

491
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,380
about the rural exodus that was occurring in this village.

492
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,680
Hero?

493
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,180
You don't know?

494
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,680
During his younger days,

495
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,380
he was a track runner nominated as candidate

496
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,080
for track in the Olympics representing Japan.

497
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,180
I forgot what exactly he competed in.

498
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,980
But, if you'd like to, do you want to go and see

499
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,180
upstairs to his room on the 2nd floor?

500
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,780
Really.

501
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,680
He seems to have competed in many contests.

502
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,480
It doesn't say what contest it was.

503
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,480
How come only the medals are here?

504
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,580
I wonder if he took all the strings off?

505
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,280
It's the statue of the Deva Kings.

506
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,380
Let's see.

507
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,980
It's pretty heavy.

508
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:54,380
It's exquisitely well made.

509
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,080
But why is there only one?

510
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,580
The Deva Kings are a pair of two wrath-filled

511
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,480
and muscular guardians of the Buddha.

512
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,180
Since that's the Unzo with its mouth closed,

513
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,980
there would usually be an Azo with its mouth open too, right?

514
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,280
The Azo of the Nioh statue,

515
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,980
on the night the incident occurred,

516
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,480
disappeared from this house together with the jewelry of Mrs. Hinohara.

517
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,680
I see. The culprit stole it?

518
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,680
Is this expensive?

519
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,180
Yes, it's the masterpiece of a famous wood carver of the Edo Era,

520
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,480
and at present its probably no less than 5 million yen.

521
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,680
Five... five million?

522
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,180
Hold it. Isn't it funny?

523
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,880
Why'd the culprit take only one of it?

524
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,380
It's worth more if they're a pair, right?

525
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,480
I wonder...

526
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,980
That seems to have bothered Mr. Shinichi Kudo,

527
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:49,980
who came here a year ago too.

528
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,280
Kudo, can't you remember anything yet?

529
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,580
Kudo.

530
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,280
Ran.

531
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,880
-Where? -Over this way.

532
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,880
Come over to this room over here.

533
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,580
You'd be surprised.

534
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,580
Shinichi's picture?

535
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:19,580
This is a picture of when Shinichi first did an interview for a magazine.

536
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,280
How nostalgic.

537
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,280
It's been enlarged.

538
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,380
It sure is big.

539
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,280
All the cases that Shinichi solved are filed.

540
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,380
Whose room is this?

541
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,580
It's Makoto's room.

542
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,380
Makoto worshipped this high school detective you see,

543
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,880
that's why when he heard that Shinichi Kudo

544
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,980
was going to come help solve the case,

545
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,280
Makoto was really happy

546
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,580
saying that he was sure Shinichi would solve the case.

547
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,980
But, the conclusion he came to was that,

548
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,580
the village head committed a double suicide.

549
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,680
Makoto was really depressed too

550
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,180
because he lost his mother

551
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,580
who fell sick when he was little.

552
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,580
And now Mr. Hinohara who adopted him as his son,

553
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,780
when he thought that he'd be alone for life was.

554
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,880
They were a typical blood type O family.

555
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,180
He told me that Mr. and Mrs. Hinohara,

556
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,580
as well as their son, Daiki were all very pleasant,

557
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:17,280
so he felt very comfortable and that he couldn't be happier.

558
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,080
So, it's hard to believe

559
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,980
that the village head would do anything to hurt his wife.

560
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,980
But, I told myself over and over again

561
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,580
that I had no choice but to accept it

562
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:31,080
because Makoto believed that you're a renown detective.

563
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,180
But it turns out that the truth of the case

564
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,980
is not what that renown detective concluded.

565
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,480
The detective was wrong

566
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,380
when he said that the Mr. Hinohara

567
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,880
was told by the doctor that he had cancer

568
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,480
and committed double suicide in despair.

569
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,680
Right. Makoto tried to get in touch you

570
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,280
by writing letters and calling you repeatedly,

571
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,380
but he was disappointed because he couldn't get a hold of you at all.

572
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,980
He said that he even personally went to see you

573
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,880
to ask you to reinvestigate the case, but you weren't in.

574
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,280
Well, yes...

575
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,280
Because he shrunk and wasn't at home.

576
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,580
But, only now you come

577
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,380
and have amnesia to make things worse?

578
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,780
You got to be kidding.

579
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,180
I want to be alone.

580
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,880
Would you please let me stay in this room alone for a while?

581
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,480
I feel as if I can maybe remember something.

582
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,380
Okay.

583
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,580
Well leave you alone for a while then.

584
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,580
Take your time and try to remember, okay?

585
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,780
Which means that the village head's son, Daiki

586
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,980
is staying with you Mr. Shiroyama?

587
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,580
Yes, Makoto was doing likewise till six months ago too.

588
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:53,080
You know, it's been bothering me from a while ago but...

589
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,280
Why is his name still Makoto Okuda?

590
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,980
If he was adopted by Mr. Hinohara,

591
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,280
wouldn't his name have been changed to Makoto Hinohara?

592
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,880
Yes. That's what's written on the family register.

593
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,980
But, he felt that it would be too audacious for him

594
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,780
to take after the village heads name,

595
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,980
so he used to go by his previous last name, Okuda.

596
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,580
Shinichi's come out.

597
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,180
And were you able to remember something?

598
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,080
Well, no need to be depressed.

599
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,080
I'm sure that you'll regain your memory in time.

600
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,480
I was wondering what kind of trick you had up sleeve,

601
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,480
but I guess you haven't come up with anything yet.

602
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,580
Trick?

603
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,680
Yes.

604
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:44,480
Mr. Kudo, I know what you're up to.

605
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,180
Oh, my. What's with that look of yours?

606
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:50,380
Don't tell me that you thought I didn't realize either?

607
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,680
Well, if you decide to give in and confess to everything,

608
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,380
come to the Kotoh Inn where I'm staying.

609
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,480
If you do,

610
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,780
I'll write a very nice article about you in the papers

611
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,480
about the truth that you're trying to hide

612
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,880
the fact that you cannot speak of.

613
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,880
Don't tell anyone, all right.

614
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,280
A truth that he cannot speak of.

615
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:28,880
Gee, that newspaper reporter lady wasn't very likable.

616
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,780
What did she mean by know what Shinichi is up to?

617
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,980
Well, what we know for now is...

618
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:37,680
that this detective kid made a mistake deducing this case

619
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,980
which can be none other than armed robbery case

620
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,580
as forced double suicide,

621
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:45,280
as well as totally mistaking the motive for murder.

622
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,980
And one more thing.

623
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,580
Within this forest,

624
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:52,980
an unidentifiable creature or something is still here hiding.

625
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,980
Kazuha.

626
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,580
What if...

627
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,280
Just what if... This is just what if okay?

628
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,680
Yes.

629
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,380
The person you've been wanting to see and love

630
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,780
suddenly appears in front of you

631
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,880
and turns out to be amnesic.

632
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,980
What would you do, Kazuha?

633
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,180
Well...

634
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,980
I'd just break down and cry.

635
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,080
I'd be so happy to see him

636
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,680
and at the same time be so sad that he had forgotten all about me.

637
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,280
I'd be overwhelmed with emotion.

638
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,280
If you can't feel this way,

639
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,980
I'd say you don't love that person.

640
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,380
He'd be no more than a friend.

641
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,180
I thought so too.

642
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,180
No, no.

643
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,680
I was just talking about stupid me just now.

644
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,280
I don't feel a thing.

645
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,380
Only...

646
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:45,980
All I feel is that Shinichi has gone far away.

647
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,480
Don't worry.

648
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,480
Once he regains his memory, everything will return to normal.

649
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,580
Yes.

650
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,780
I wonder what's gotten into me?

651
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,780
Oh no. Rain.

652
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,380
This is bad.

653
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,680
Let's run to the inn.

654
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,080
Hurry, hurry.

655
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,180
"Okuho Inn" -What? Shinichi is not in the room?

656
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,780
Yes, when I got up in the morning

657
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,380
his side of the bed was empty.

658
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,780
Oh, no.

659
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,180
Hey.

660
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,380
I asked a villager just now

661
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,180
and he told me he saw Shinichi go into Mr. Hinohara's residence

662
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,080
early in the morning.

663
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,280
Don't tell me that he got his memory back?

664
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,480
Hey, Kudo!

665
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:54,180
Kudo's shoes and a woman's shoes?

666
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,980
Are you in there, Kudo?

667
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,980
There he is.

668
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,980
You got your memory back, right?

669
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,480
That's why you came here, right, Kudo?

670
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,780
Blood?

671
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,180
What's up?

672
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,180
You're bleeding profusely.

673
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,490
Hey, Kudo.

674
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,790
What's going on?

675
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,390
What happened?

676
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:30,990
I don't know.

677
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,190
My mind just went blank.

678
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,590
When I snapped back to myself, I was here.

679
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,490
Did I do it?

680
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:45,090
Did I... kill her?

681
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,290
She's still alive.

682
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:54,290
So you were here after all, detective kid.

683
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,190
Isn't she the newspaper reporter?

684
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,890
What happened?

685
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,690
She's bleeding badly.

686
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,290
Explain later.

687
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:08,190
Hurry call an ambulance and the police.

688
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:11,590
No, all you need to call is the ambulance.

689
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,190
Why?

690
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,990
Somebody did this to her, right?

691
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,990
How can you be so dense?

692
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,590
If we call the police with things the way they are,

693
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:23,290
the police will deem Shinichi the culprit.

694
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:24,890
Oh no...

695
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,390
Don't tell me that you...

696
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:30,090
Idiot. Kudo would never stab anyone.

697
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,690
This is a trap.

698
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,790
Somebody set it up to look as if Kudo did it.

699
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:39,890
After all there seems to be many who hate Kudo in this village.

700
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:44,090
Besides, if Kudo's taken to the police now...

701
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:45,190
No matter if he's innocent,

702
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,490
he'll have to be interrogated for a long period of time.

703
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:51,490
If the drug that will return his body back to a child's takes effect,

704
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,390
it'll be more than I can handle.

705
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,390
Call the ambulance, Kazuha.

706
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:58,890
Pops, bring the car here and hide Kudo, will you?

707
00:36:58,890 --> 00:36:59,890
Okay.

708
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,090
Yes.

709
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,590
That's the siren of an ambulance...

710
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,590
There are the sounds of police cars too.

711
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,190
It's getting closer.

712
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,690
Who called them?

713
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:18,190
I see.

714
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:22,090
You had doubts about a solved murder case

715
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,990
that occurred here a year ago,

716
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:26,590
despite having come here last night,

717
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,790
came back here again and found

718
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:31,390
newspaper reporter Ms. Misato Kawauchi,

719
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:35,390
stabbed in the stomach and lying here.

720
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:38,090
Yes, Detective Kogoro Mouri?

721
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,690
Yes, well I guess.

722
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:44,590
And when you came, are you sure that no one else

723
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,190
other than the victim was here?

724
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,690
Yes. Right?

725
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,690
Yes.

726
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:51,990
Well, the murder weapon is here,

727
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,590
so if we conduct investigation of the hardware at the entrance,

728
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:57,290
well probably come up with the culprit right away.

729
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,490
Hardware?

730
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:01,490
In police jargon, it means footprints.

731
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,690
But, how can you figure it out?

732
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:08,390
The ground is muddy from the rain all night yesterday,

733
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,190
so shoe prints are left on the ground.

734
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,490
The prints of the victim

735
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,090
and the culprit are left clear on the ground.

736
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:18,790
But, officer. They could be our shoe prints.

737
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:21,490
No. You all came here after the sun rose

738
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:24,590
and the ground more or less dried,

739
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,290
so your shoe prints are shallow.

740
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:28,790
We already matched your prints with those of your shoes at the entrance,

741
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,190
so there's no doubt.

742
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:33,190
What bothers me are the shoes prints of the culprit

743
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:36,190
who came here at the break of day when the ground while still wet.

744
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:39,490
Why did the culprit go outside from the backdoor of this house

745
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,690
after the ground dried?

746
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:45,090
Moreover, the number of people who came here

747
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,590
after the ground dried is supposed to be four,

748
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,690
but there are only three here.

749
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:52,490
What's more, the owner of the fourth shoes print also went outside

750
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:55,390
for some reason from the backdoor.

751
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:59,790
I wonder if you, Mr. Sleeping Kogoro can solve this mystery?

752
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,190
Oh, well...

753
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,890
I can't say anything yet.

754
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:04,090
Listen, Kudo.

755
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:05,390
I know it's sort of cramped in there,

756
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,790
but hang in there, okay?

757
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,590
Hold up for a while

758
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,890
until I find the real culprit and let you out of here.

759
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,490
The effect of the drug according to the little lady will keep

760
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,890
keep for 24 hours.

761
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:22,790
I've got to solve the case completely before sundown at all cost.

762
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,290
Heiji.

763
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,790
I can't take lying any longer.

764
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,890
She's right, Heiji.

765
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,690
I think we should tell the truth

766
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:36,090
and cooperate with the police in their investigation.

767
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:38,090
It's easy for them to say because they don't know anything.

768
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:42,090
Well, the situation looks really bad, though.

769
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,490
It seems that today the people who went to that house

770
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:47,290
before the police came, were we four,

771
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,990
the victim, Mrs. Kawauchi

772
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:52,990
and that detective kid, but no one else.

773
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,490
Is that true?

774
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:55,690
Yes.

775
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:58,290
The surroundings of the house was investigated with great care,

776
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:01,990
but only the shoes prints of the six, were found, I heard.

777
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:05,490
Shinichi's shoes are those that you bought for him

778
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,890
at the store of this village.

779
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:08,590
No matter how much we try to hide Shinichi,

780
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,590
I'm sure they'll find him right away.

781
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,590
A trick.

782
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:15,390
Somebody summoned the two,

783
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,990
drugged Shinichi putting him to sleep

784
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,090
wore his clothes

785
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,090
and stabbed Mrs. Kawauchi in the stomach.

786
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:23,190
But, if so...

787
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:27,990
That somebody's shoes prints should be left here, shouldn't it?

788
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:31,090
That's why I'm saying a tricks been used.

789
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,890
There's got to be a way.

790
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,390
Wait a second.

791
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,490
The house should've been locked.

792
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:40,090
How'd the culprit make it inside?

793
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:43,790
Neither Kudo nor Mrs. Kawauchi have the key to the house, do they?

794
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,190
Right.

795
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,390
When we went there last night

796
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:49,590
the police officer called Mr. Shiroyama opened the door for us.

797
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,590
That's right.

798
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:53,490
Why'd that police officer have the key to the house?

799
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,990
I got it from Daiki.

800
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:02,190
Did anybody besides you have the key to the house?

801
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,690
I have the keys that the head of the house

802
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:07,490
and his wife had also.

803
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:11,690
If anyone else were to have the key,

804
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:15,190
it would be their foster son, Makoto.

805
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,690
But, his whereabouts are unknown.

806
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:19,390
Now that you mentioned it...

807
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,090
During the time that Makoto left for the city

808
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:22,990
to take his university exam,

809
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:27,590
they key was temporarily given to his classmate, Ms. Hikawa,

810
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:31,390
so she could help around the house.

811
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,590
If I remember correctly,

812
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:38,290
on the day of Makoto's university exam is when the incident occurred.

813
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:39,690
Yes.

814
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:43,690
If so, that young lady called Hikawa may be a suspect.

815
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:45,990
Well, if she had the key,

816
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:48,290
she could've made a spare.

817
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:49,690
Maybe that young lady's the one responsible

818
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:52,590
for the incident a year ago, that Kudo deduced wrongly,

819
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:55,790
as well as for the incident that occurred this morning.

820
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:58,290
What did he deduce wrongly?

821
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:01,290
It's true that the house was totally messed up.

822
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:02,990
But it could have been that just as Shinichi said

823
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:05,790
Mr. Hinohara killed his wife and after that messed the room up

824
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:09,990
to make it look like it was armed robbery.

825
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,890
Idiot. It seems that when the incident happened a year ago,

826
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:15,690
the ground was also muddy from rain,

827
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:18,690
but the only thing they found around the house

828
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:21,790
were the shoe prints of one person going to the road

829
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,590
from the backdoor and back.

830
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:26,790
The culprit also walked around inside the house wearing shoes.

831
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:30,490
If Mr. Hinohara wanted to make it look like armed robbery,

832
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:32,090
and went outside with those shoes on,

833
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:34,490
then came back to the house again,

834
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:38,190
those shoes should be somewhere in the house, right?

835
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,490
True.

836
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,190
If he threw his shoes out of the house

837
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:44,690
the police are sure to have found them already, right?

838
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:48,890
The house of the veranda is about 30 m from the lake,

839
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:50,990
so there's no way the shoes would've made it inside.

840
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:55,290
But, I'm sure that Shinichi knew of that too, no?

841
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:59,990
Yes. That's why I've been thinking all night from last night...

842
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:01,190
No, wrong.

843
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,890
Even if we were to assume that the culprit who had the key

844
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,590
was ambushing them inside.

845
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:08,690
Unless you can find a way to go in and out of the house

846
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:10,590
without leaving shoes prints behind,

847
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,890
the murder would be impossible to commit.

848
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,190
An impossible crime.

849
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:16,690
Impossible crime.

850
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:20,390
A mysterious murder trick, but...

851
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,990
Shinichi would...

852
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:26,690
I'm sure that Shinichi would find a way.

853
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:27,890
Darn.

854
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:29,090
If Shinichi were his usual self,

855
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:30,990
we would've been able to think it out together

856
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:32,790
and solve it in no time.

857
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:36,390
Maybe we've got to go see Death after all.

858
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,690
Why Death?

859
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:42,090
Because the villager said yesterday, remember.

860
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:45,990
That he lost his memory after seeing Death in the forest.

861
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,190
And, last night

862
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:48,490
before going to bed

863
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:50,490
I heard from the clerk at the inn together with Ran

864
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:52,790
on what to do if Death's curse fell upon a person.

865
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:57,290
The clerk told us to go into the forest while the sun is still high.

866
00:43:57,290 --> 00:44:04,990
When you see Death shout with all your might and call him.

867
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:07,790
And continue to pray with a heart that isn't tarnished.

868
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:10,590
Then, the curse will be lifted.

869
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:13,190
That is what's being said in this village.

870
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:16,890
But, there's virtually no one who actually tried it.

871
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:21,990
But, the clerk told us that the newspaper reporter lady did it.

872
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:23,290
Is that for real?

873
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:26,390
Yes. The clerk said that her daughter that she brought along with her

874
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:28,490
when she came to interview the people about the incident a year ago,

875
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:32,490
her daughter went into the forest and never came back so.

876
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:33,990
Hey.

877
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,290
Ran's not here.

878
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:36,590
What?

879
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:39,090
Don't tell me that she took that story seriously

880
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,690
and went into the forest?

881
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:50,990
Death...

882
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:52,890
Death.

883
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:53,990
Please.

884
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:56,890
Return Shinichi back to normal.

885
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:59,290
If you don't mind my tarnished heart and all,

886
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:01,190
I'll give it to you.

887
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:03,090
That's why please return Shinichi

888
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:05,090
back to the real Shinichi.

889
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:10,290
Please, Death.

890
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:26,590
There... there he is.

891
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:29,690
He's really there.

892
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:34,390
Wait...

893
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:37,390
No good. I'm so scared that I've lost my voice.

894
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:47,490
Hey, wasn't that...

895
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:49,390
Wasn't that Ran's voice?

896
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:50,990
Something must've happened.

897
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:54,590
-Ran! -Ran...

898
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:56,490
-Where are you? -Ran!

899
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,190
No good.

900
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:04,690
My whole body hurts and I can't move.

901
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:08,390
What am I doing anyway?

902
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,590
I come into the forest of my own initiative,

903
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:13,990
then fall on my own.

904
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:15,490
How stupid can I get.

905
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:34,890
Death.

906
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:40,290
Please... please return Shinichi...

907
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:42,090
Please return Shinichi to normal.

908
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,180
Next Conan's Hint:

909
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:25,820
"The Curse of Death".

910
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,780
In the next episode Shinichi's memory...

911
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,900
And, the truth of the case is...

912
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,400
Don't miss it.
