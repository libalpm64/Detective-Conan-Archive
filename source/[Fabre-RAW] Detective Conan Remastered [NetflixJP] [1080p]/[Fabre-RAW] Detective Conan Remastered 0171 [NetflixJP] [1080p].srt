1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:03,790
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,690
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:07,790
Deductions take shapes and styles in each and every car to be solved.

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,590
The case is solved by a person's feelings.

5
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,590
I want to find out how Ran really feels.

6
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,090
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,190
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,690
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,940
Pops' check up indicates that

10
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,840
he only has six months to go.

11
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,940
But it turns out to be Pops' mistake.

12
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,040
Pops was told to stay away from alcohol for six months.

13
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,440
Dr. Araide invites us to stay for dinner at his house.

14
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,540
However...

15
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,440
After an instant of black out,

16
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,340
Dr. Araide was found dead in the bath tub.

17
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,840
"Blind Spot in the Darkness (Part 2)"

18
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,040
You're a doctor and coach of a basketball club as well?

19
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,440
You can ask Ran about me.

20
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,140
I coach at Teitan High School, the school that she goes to.

21
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,040
Don't tell me that

22
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,840
Ran's going to that karate class everyday because...

23
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,040
She wants to see him?

24
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,140
I see.

25
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,740
Is that right, Ran?

26
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,740
Yes, you can verify the fact

27
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,040
if you contact the high school.

28
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,540
I think that's prove my innocence.

29
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,440
-May I give the treatment? -Sure.

30
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,040
Oh, and I want you to come to the clinic too, Grandma.

31
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,640
You can't fool me.

32
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,740
I see you've been trying hide the fact that

33
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,340
something is wrong with your leg when you walk, since some time ago.

34
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,840
Leg?

35
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,840
What happened here?

36
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,540
When the lights went out and I came down here,

37
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,640
I stepped on something strange.

38
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,240
May I go to help him treat everyone?

39
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,140
Sure, go ahead.

40
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,540
Inspector. I've verified the person that

41
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,540
Yoko was talking to on the phone when the lights went out.

42
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,540
Oh, and?

43
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,040
According to the person she was talking to,

44
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,040
the time it took since Yoko told her that the lights went out

45
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,340
to the time she reported that the lights went back on,

46
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,240
was about a minute.

47
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,940
I'd like to hear from Yoko what they were talking about,

48
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,340
and see if they match.

49
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,640
Will you tell us?

50
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,240
Yes,

51
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,240
after I finish help him treat everyone.

52
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,540
Well...

53
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,340
if it's okay with you, I can go help him instead.

54
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,140
I'm pretty good at doing things like this.

55
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,240
Oh, then will you?

56
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,340
Huh?

57
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,040
The contents of what they talked about match.

58
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,740
A catch phone came in, and their conversation

59
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,140
was interrupted only for a matter of 6 to 7 seconds.

60
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,940
There is no doubt that Yoko was on the phone

61
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,840
right through the black out.

62
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,940
True.

63
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,440
Why, of course...

64
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,740
If you have the blueprint of this house,

65
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,140
I would like to take a look at it.

66
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,540
Yes, of course.

67
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,940
This is the bath tub where your husband

68
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,540
was electrocuted to death.

69
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,840
So, this is the kitchen where we are now.

70
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,740
Yes.

71
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,340
Uh, where's the breaker?

72
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,540
Go left the corridor in front of kitchen,

73
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,140
then go left twice, and turn right once.

74
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,140
It's over here.

75
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,440
Hikaru left the kitchen to check the breaker

76
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,240
at just about the same time that

77
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,940
you were telling Masae about the black out on the phone?

78
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,740
-Yes. -If so,

79
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,640
isn't one minute much too long?

80
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,340
It looks to me that it wouldn't take 30 seconds

81
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,140
to get to the breaker.

82
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,040
Hikaru is a newcomer here

83
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,740
and she's still not used to this house.

84
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,040
But, when the young doctor saw Hikaru's burn, he said,

85
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,340
"You're always too tolerant from before."

86
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,840
Oh.

87
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,340
Tomoaki was talking about his days back

88
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,440
when he was a medical student at Tohto University,

89
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,540
and Hikaru used to be one of his patients.

90
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,940
It seems that she was tolerated pain so much

91
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,540
that her appendix almost burst.

92
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,540
So, that's how Hikaru came to work for this house?

93
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,740
Yes. Since Mother is aged,

94
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,740
and it's hard of me to keep such a large house in order,

95
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,940
I was looking for a live-in maid.

96
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,040
I feel wretched,

97
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,640
because I hear Chiaki used to handle everything by herself.

98
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,040
Chiaki?

99
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,540
Oh. You mean Tomoaki's mother who passed away.

100
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,740
The one who passed away of a traffic accident four years ago.

101
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,940
I hear she was drunk driving.

102
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,040
She wasn't a strong drinker, and she never really drank much.

103
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,340
So, I still can't believe it actually happened yet.

104
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,140
By the way, where is grandma's room?

105
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,040
Oh, it's upstairs.

106
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,740
You go up the stairs to the left of the kitchen

107
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,640
and the large room in the foreground is her room.

108
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,940
An elderly has a room that is upstairs?

109
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,040
Yes, mother likes the room where she can have

110
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,640
an overall view of the garden.

111
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,740
Hikaru's room is situated right next door,

112
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,440
so that when something happens, she could run right over.

113
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,440
Inspector, the killer probably used the catch phone.

114
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,640
While Yoko was distracted by the catch phone,

115
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,440
the killer went by the kitchen, went to the bathroom

116
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,440
and soaked the electric cord into the water.

117
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,440
You idiot. How's the killer going to get back out then?

118
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,640
I guess so.

119
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,040
What are you whispering to each other about again?

120
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,440
Uh, well...

121
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,940
Sir!

122
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,140
Why don't we see what everyone was doing

123
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,140
when it blacked out, by mimicking?

124
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,740
I guess you're right.

125
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,040
Let's have them act it out

126
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,740
while their memories are still fresh.

127
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,040
I'll go get everybody then.

128
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,740
You're pretty good at wrapping bandage too, aren't you?

129
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,840
Oh, yes.

130
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,640
When I was little,

131
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,040
there was this brat who used to always get hurt.

132
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,540
That's why I'm so used to.

133
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,340
This was really long ago though.

134
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,940
Hey.

135
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,940
Gosh, what a bummer,

136
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,740
the one who is treating the patient gets hurt.

137
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,740
Well, but all you need to do is wash the wound

138
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,040
and bandage it, then it'll be fine.

139
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,740
I...

140
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,740
I...

141
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,740
What's up, Conan?

142
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,240
The Inspector told me tell you all to come.

143
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,340
Okay, we'll go.

144
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,740
-Hikaru. -Yes.

145
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,340
Will get a band aid from that shelf over there for me?

146
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,340
Okay.

147
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,340
You idiot, why'd you have to show up?

148
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,340
Uh, where's the breaker?

149
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,840
It should be around the corner to the right.

150
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,540
There it is.

151
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,140
That must be it.

152
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,940
Hey, Conan.

153
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,040
Look out, because this is the place

154
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,440
that Hikaru cracked the flower vase.

155
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,940
I cleaned the pieces of glass of the flower vase with Hikaru,

156
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,340
but she sure had a tough time.

157
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,740
Dr. Araide bawled her out saying,

158
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,140
"Next time you goof, you're out."

159
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,740
Wait a sec.

160
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,340
Maybe this is...

161
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,240
Okay, are you all ready? Let's get started.

162
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,740
Yes, everything's fine by the stairs.

163
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,140
I'm in position under the breaker.

164
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,740
Okay, Takagi lower the breaker.

165
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,840
Okay.

166
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,340
Hikaru, please go over to the breaker.

167
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,440
Yes.

168
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,940
34 seconds. She didn't take a minute after all.

169
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,540
Inspector.

170
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,340
Please take a look.

171
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,340
If you go across this garden,

172
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,740
you'd have to go pass Yoko to get to the tub.

173
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,540
Hey, hey, don't tell me that...

174
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,340
Yes, that person could've committed t crime.

175
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,540
-Hey. -That's enough.

176
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,940
Like I already said!

177
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,440
Everyone in this house has an alibi

178
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,340
just before the black out!

179
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,340
So, what's the use of checking on alibis after the black out?

180
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,940
So that's...

181
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,140
Wait.

182
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,540
All it looks to me is that

183
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,540
you guys are making a big thing out of nothing

184
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,840
and amusing yourselves over a mere accidental death.

185
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,340
Excuse me.

186
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,140
Did I goof again?

187
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,740
No.

188
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,640
An alibi?

189
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,440
Who of the four among them have an alibi

190
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,840
during the time that the killing can be carried out?

191
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,040
That person's the only one.

192
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,040
Among the remaining three,

193
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,040
the most suspicious person is...

194
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,840
A piece of something?

195
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,240
I wonder if this red thing is blood.

196
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,540
And, what is this thing stuck on to it?

197
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,340
It can't be?

198
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,440
Just as I thought.

199
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,640
It was that person after all.

200
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,740
Which means that there is only one.

201
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,940
Only that person could be the killer.

202
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,530
It takes about 10 seconds to make a round trip.

203
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,030
It seems that she is

204
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,030
capable of committing the murder after all.

205
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:10,630
Then, the thing that we were concerned about...

206
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,730
Yes.

207
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,230
It doesn't seem like it had anything to do with this.

208
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,930
Hey, it's come to you?

209
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,430
Yes. I've just figured out what went on.

210
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:28,930
I'll explain, so please take me to the bath tub.

211
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:32,430
My legs have gone weak, since I've figured everything out.

212
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,430
What? Take a bath?

213
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,630
Mr. Mouri?

214
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,730
He's wet with rain.

215
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,730
Besides, he says he wants to see if he can really

216
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,030
be electrocuted to death by using a shaver in the tub.

217
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,230
Huh? Where are the Inspector and the other officers?

218
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,830
They said they'd call it a day and left just a while ago.

219
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,130
Oh, what a waste.

220
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,530
What a waste?

221
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:00,830
Because Pops said that he'd be putting on a deduction show

222
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:03,430
after he finishes taking a bath.

223
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,930
Did Mr. Mouri really say so?

224
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,230
Yep. He says he's figured out who the killer is.

225
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,830
Killer?

226
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,830
Didn't my husband die of an accident?

227
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,830
Beats me. I don't know about it.

228
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,530
He says he wants to put his thoughts together

229
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,030
while taking a nice bath,

230
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,430
so he wants you all to wait awhile.

231
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,730
It's already been 20 minutes since he went in.

232
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,530
Mr. Mouri sure is late.

233
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,430
I can't take this anymore. That flimsy mustache dude.

234
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,630
Come, come now, mother.

235
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,030
Ran...

236
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,230
Could it be...

237
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,930
Don't tell me it's another black out?

238
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,130
Hikaru. Will you please go check the breaker?

239
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,230
Yes.

240
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,530
I wonder why it blacked out again.

241
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,730
Come to think of it, that man

242
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,530
was saying something about experimenting in the bath tub.

243
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,530
Don't tell me that something happened to Dad.

244
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,730
How quick. The lights went on already.

245
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,830
No, it's too soon.

246
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,930
Officer?

247
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:27,630
So, you were the one after all,

248
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,730
Mrs. Yoko Araide.

249
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:35,230
Huh? That little boy and Yoko's not here.

250
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,930
A trap?

251
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,430
Inspector?

252
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,630
I'm the one?

253
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,130
Just what are you talking about?

254
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,630
I just came to check

255
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,730
because I was worried about Mr. Mouri doing his experiment

256
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,330
using the shaver in the bath tub.

257
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,330
You wanted it to look that way,

258
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,630
and kill me, who figured out what happened,

259
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:02,930
then, pose as the first one who had found me, isn't it so?

260
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,930
Don't be ridiculous.

261
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:08,830
I was on the phone all through the black out.

262
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,230
You rigged a timer somewhere,

263
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,830
so it would short circuit and black out.

264
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,630
And, using that pen light,

265
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,630
you found yourself through the darkness to the bath tub,

266
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,730
which after you soaked the extension cord into the tub

267
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,630
that your husband was soaking in.

268
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,730
You set it up so that when someone lifted the breaker,

269
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,430
your husband would be electrocuted.

270
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,430
Like I said, I was on the phone with my friend

271
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,630
throughout the black out.

272
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,530
How could I have done it?

273
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,930
It's simple if you hide the cordless phone of this house

274
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,930
and a cellular phone into your pocket beforehand.

275
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:52,630
You used the cordless phone.

276
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,930
Moreover, the main phone has a built-in rechargeable battery

277
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:59,630
that makes it usable even during black outs.

278
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,530
Right after Hikaru left the kitchen,

279
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,230
you used the cordless in place of the receiver that you were holding

280
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,430
and went to the tub.

281
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:11,730
Then, you used your cellular to call that house again,

282
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,530
and interrupted the conversation once.

283
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,030
You went to the bath tub,

284
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:21,030
grabbed the extension cord that was plugged into the outlet

285
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:24,630
and put it quietly into the water.

286
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,930
At that time, you probably said something like be careful

287
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,130
and lead your husband to grab the railing.

288
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,230
Then, you returned to the corridor before the kitchen

289
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,930
while talking on the phone using the cordless.

290
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,630
You switched from using the cordless to the receiver of the main phone

291
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,530
and waited for the light to go on.

292
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,730
Right after Hikaru lifted the breaker,

293
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:48,830
that is why the short circuit breaker was set off.

294
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,630
As soon as the breaker was lifted,

295
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,330
an over flow of electricity ran through the railing,

296
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:58,430
and your husband died of shock.

297
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,730
But, Mr. Mouri,

298
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,130
I wasn't the only one who'd be able to do that, right?

299
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,130
Right. According to your plan,

300
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,330
you were supposed to set up your alibi by staying on the phone,

301
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,330
as well as set everyone else' alibi up

302
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:14,230
by blocking the corridor.

303
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,930
But, your calculations didn't work.

304
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:22,730
Since Hikaru took 30 seconds more to lift the breaker,

305
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,830
her alibi could not be established.

306
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,730
Why did she take so much time, then?

307
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,730
Do you know?

308
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,930
The chawanmushi.

309
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:40,730
When it blacked out, Hikaru cracked a dish in the kitchen.

310
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,530
She carried that dish under her arm,

311
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,430
and hid it in her room upstairs

312
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:48,730
before going over to the breaker.

313
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,430
She did so because your husband threatened her

314
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:55,830
saying that the next time she goofed, she's out.

315
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:58,130
That's how she got burnt, then?

316
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,030
Yes, she got burn wounds

317
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:03,930
and Mitsu hurt her leg at that time.

318
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,830
Mitsu who went out in the dark,

319
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:12,130
stepped on the piece of glass that Hikaru had dropped.

320
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,730
If Hikaru makes a round trip to her room,

321
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,930
it would take her 30 seconds more,

322
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:20,730
and Mitsu was definitely upstairs at that time.

323
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,330
Tomoaki, who was grabbed by the arm by Ran

324
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:26,030
throughout the black out is out of the question.

325
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,930
You understand now, don't you, Yoko?

326
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:32,130
The only person who could've committed the crime back then

327
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,530
is you, Yoko.

328
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,530
Inspector. Let me go to the bath tub.

329
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,130
We're still investigating.

330
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,730
Setting up a trap, you call this investigation.

331
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,230
You've gotta be kidding.

332
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,930
What a stupid kid.

333
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,830
Hiding the dish won't help

334
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,630
because all one has to do is count the dishes to find out.

335
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,130
If Hikaru didn't do something like that,

336
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,530
I wouldn't have been suspected either.

337
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,630
No. Even if she didn't hide the dish,

338
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,130
I took it to be you, anyway.

339
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,130
What?

340
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,930
The hand that you held the receiver in.

341
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,130
Before Hikaru left the kitchen,

342
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,730
you were holding the receiver in your left hand.

343
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,030
But, after the lights went on, you were for some reason

344
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,730
had switched it to your right.

345
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:26,630
So, I thought you may have walked away from the phone once.

346
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,430
You went to the bath tub together with Hikaru

347
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:33,730
because you didn't want her to be electrocuted by accident.

348
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:37,630
If Conan didn't stop Tomoaki who came later,

349
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,230
you were going to stop him too.

350
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,030
Yes, that's right,

351
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:45,830
because the late Chiaki had asked me to take care of him.

352
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:49,530
Yes, four years ago, before the car accident,

353
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,030
she called me and told me,

354
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,530
"Protect Tomoaki for me,"

355
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:58,130
"so that he won't turn out to be like my husband."

356
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,030
I didn't know what she meant back then,

357
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:06,930
after I married him and found her dairy, I understood everything.

358
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,830
That he was a man who slept with every woman he saw.

359
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:13,130
He had no morals.

360
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,530
And that he was the very one who made cheerful Chiaki

361
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:19,230
drown herself in alcohol and drove her to death.

362
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,830
Hey!

363
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,930
If possible, I'd advise you to turn yourself in.

364
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,230
Oh my, how kind of you.

365
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,230
No, it's not for your sake.

366
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,930
But, for Hikaru's sake.

367
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,930
You don't understand anything.

368
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:41,130
You are the one who set the murder up,

369
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,930
but, Hikaru is the one who pulled the trigger

370
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,530
when she raised the breaker.

371
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:50,330
If she ever finds out, she'll have to carry the burden for life.

372
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,830
You mean the you didn't mention that

373
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,330
the first black out was rigged because...

374
00:19:55,330 --> 00:20:00,630
Yes, because we didn't want her to think she was responsible.

375
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,630
I'd like to make a suggestion.

376
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,530
Could you please confess that you soaked Mr. Araide in the water,

377
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,630
put him to sleep with medication

378
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,430
then, put a cord attached to a timer inside the water

379
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,930
and electrocuted him,

380
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:18,030
which after you retrieved the timer during the black out?

381
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,230
In other words, say that the black out

382
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,630
was not the cause of the murder.

383
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,330
Of course if you were to leak the fact

384
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,830
that asked you to confess as such,

385
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,730
we would be put in hot water too.

386
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,730
Yes, I'll do as you say.

387
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:39,230
I'm still not ready to give up having a heart yet.

388
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:11,130
I'm sorry to have kept you here for so long.

389
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,130
No problem.

390
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,830
I want you to relay something to your Dad

391
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,330
from the corner of the corridor for me.

392
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,730
Who, me?

393
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,330
Don't tell me that...

394
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,030
No.

395
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,630
I'm sorry that I got carried away like that a while ago,

396
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,630
and that I'd be willing to cooperate if he should need anything.

397
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,230
How silly of me.

398
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,630
Excuse me.

399
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,730
I'm sorry to impose on you at a time like this.

400
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,430
But, if it's okay with you...

401
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:41,930
Could you lend me that hand knitted sweater for a while?

402
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:44,630
Sweater?

403
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,930
"Law Eri Kisaki"

404
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,330
It's like this over here.

405
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:54,530
-Uh, and here... -My, what's with that sweater?

406
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:57,130
I borrowed it because I liked the pattern.

407
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,730
My, look at the pattern.

408
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,630
It's difficult to knit.

409
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,730
That place is not right. Here, lend it to me.

410
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:07,430
Oh, don't. I'm going to knit this by myself.

411
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:10,730
Sure? It's not my fault if it doesn't come out right, okay?

412
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,230
Oh, that's why, if I don't know how to knit it,

413
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,030
knit it beside me again and show me.

414
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:19,430
I've already knitted two sweaters for you.

415
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,530
I sure would like to ask the owner of the sweaters

416
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,630
some gift or something as a token of appreciation.

417
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,730
Oh, come on.

418
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,230
He's doing the best he can too.

419
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,530
Oh my, how envious.

420
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,730
Uh, over here it's like this.

421
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,130
Oh, and as for the sweaters that I've knitted,

422
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,130
will you please get rid of them because I don't need them?

423
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,630
Okay.

424
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,430
"A few days later" -Did you get it?

425
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:43,830
Yeah, Dr. Agasa sent it to me yesterday.

426
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,430
And, did you try it on?

427
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,530
Yeah, I'm wearing it now.

428
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,630
Thanks.

429
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,130
What's so funny?

430
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,630
Oh, no, it's nothing.

431
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:57,330
Hey, what's so darn funny?

432
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,930
I'm not telling you.

433
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:14,130
What was that?

434
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,030
Sonoko?

435
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,930
What's up, Sonoko?

436
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,230
Next Conan,

437
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:32,250
"Dying Message Revives (Part 1)"

438
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,550
Next Conan's Hint:

439
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,250
"Sound of fireworks"

440
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,850
The next episode takes place at a skating rink.

441
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,950
Step aside! Go away!
