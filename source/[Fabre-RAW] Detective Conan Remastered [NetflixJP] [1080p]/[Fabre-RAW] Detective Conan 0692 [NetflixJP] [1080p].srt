2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:06,839
Confirmed M.

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,139
His cell phone is ringing.

4
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:11,639
Hello, Mouri's here.

5
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,339
Yeah, Nihonbashi Post Office.

6
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:17,339
I got it!

7
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:21,939
The man on the phone told me

8
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:24,739
to pick up the stuff at the post office.

9
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:26,939
And, he says I gotta make it there in 5 minutes.

10
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,139
Let me through.

11
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:32,239
M is going south down Chuo Boulevard.

12
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,239
I came to get my stuff that's supposed to be here.

13
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,339
Yes, sir, I.D. please.

14
00:01:01,139 --> 00:01:05,139
This case started 5 days ago.

15
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:08,739
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

16
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:10,739
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

17
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:12,439
The culprit designates pops?

18
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,539
Cherry blossom viewing on a boat turns out to be a surprising case.

19
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:16,139
He sees through the one and only truth.

20
00:01:16,139 --> 00:01:18,039
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

21
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:20,739
His name is Detective Conan!

22
00:03:02,686 --> 00:03:08,086
"Sumida River Night Cherry Blossom Route (Part 1)"

23
00:03:08,086 --> 00:03:12,586
Bye! See you. Take care.

24
00:03:12,586 --> 00:03:15,886
The employees of a company called New Image

25
00:03:15,886 --> 00:03:18,686
that exclusively handles import of American cars,

26
00:03:18,686 --> 00:03:20,286
are attacked one after the other

27
00:03:20,286 --> 00:03:22,786
and are seriously injured.

28
00:03:24,086 --> 00:03:29,186
And the president of New Image receives a threatening call.

29
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:32,386
24,000,000 yen?

30
00:03:32,386 --> 00:03:33,686
You must be kidding.

31
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:39,786
I see.

32
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:44,086
So, 24,000,000 yen is the amount that fits just right into the briefcase.

33
00:03:44,086 --> 00:03:45,586
Hey, Conan.

34
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:48,886
What're you doing in a place like this?

35
00:03:49,886 --> 00:03:52,086
I went to the department store with Ran,

36
00:03:52,086 --> 00:03:55,086
but happened to see pops running by.

37
00:03:55,086 --> 00:03:56,986
Mr. Mouri is on duty right now,

38
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,186
so don't bother him, okay?

39
00:03:58,186 --> 00:03:59,186
Okay.

40
00:04:03,986 --> 00:04:05,686
Miwako. Did I keep you waiting?

41
00:04:05,686 --> 00:04:06,686
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:06,686 --> 00:04:08,286
I sure did.

43
00:04:08,286 --> 00:04:10,886
I mean, it's your treat today, okay?

44
00:04:10,886 --> 00:04:13,786
What? I mean, I always treat you, don't I?

45
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,686
Did you say something just now?

46
00:04:15,686 --> 00:04:17,486
No, I didn't.

47
00:04:18,886 --> 00:04:21,886
So shall we get going, then?

48
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:22,886
I guess so.

49
00:04:31,786 --> 00:04:34,486
Put the money in this briefcase.

50
00:04:34,486 --> 00:04:35,786
Throw away your cell phone.

51
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:38,386
I'll contact you with this transceiver.

52
00:04:38,386 --> 00:04:40,286
Get on the Hanami Cruise Liner departing

53
00:04:40,286 --> 00:04:44,186
at 05:45 pm from the foot of Nihonbashi.

54
00:04:44,186 --> 00:04:46,886
Dispose of the microphone you're using to keep in touch with the police.

55
00:04:49,086 --> 00:04:52,886
M is headed again north on Chuo Boulevard.

56
00:04:52,886 --> 00:04:53,886
Roger.

57
00:04:56,486 --> 00:04:57,486
Conan.

58
00:04:57,486 --> 00:04:59,386
This is the memo that pops threw away.

59
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:02,186
I think it has something to do with your job.

60
00:05:02,186 --> 00:05:04,586
Thank you. Be careful and go home.

61
00:05:07,986 --> 00:05:10,486
Directions from the culprit are written on this memo.

62
00:05:11,586 --> 00:05:12,686
Inspector Megure.

63
00:05:12,686 --> 00:05:14,586
According to the culprit's memo,

64
00:05:14,586 --> 00:05:17,286
they're going to be making contact using a transceiver from now on.

65
00:05:17,286 --> 00:05:21,086
It says for him to get on a cruiser from Nihonbashi.

66
00:05:21,086 --> 00:05:23,886
Well, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

67
00:05:26,486 --> 00:05:28,186
Are you Mr. Ishida?

68
00:05:28,186 --> 00:05:29,386
Yes.

69
00:05:29,386 --> 00:05:31,386
We thought you weren't going to come anymore.

70
00:05:31,386 --> 00:05:32,886
I'm so sorry.

71
00:05:35,386 --> 00:05:38,886
I'm sorry everyone, for making you wait.

72
00:05:38,886 --> 00:05:41,186
Okay, since everyone's on board,

73
00:05:41,186 --> 00:05:42,886
we'll start off.

74
00:05:51,386 --> 00:05:53,486
The cruiser that M is on board has departed.

75
00:05:56,486 --> 00:05:57,986
Sir.

76
00:05:57,986 --> 00:06:01,386
The boat that just left is a cherry blossom viewing cruiser, isn't it?

77
00:06:01,386 --> 00:06:03,286
Where is it going?

78
00:06:03,286 --> 00:06:07,186
That's going to Sumida River then to Ooyoko River.

79
00:06:07,186 --> 00:06:09,186
Would you like a pamphlet?

80
00:06:09,186 --> 00:06:10,786
Thank you.

81
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:12,986
"Spring Cherry Blossom Viewing Cruise"

82
00:06:15,886 --> 00:06:17,786
But, inspector...

83
00:06:17,786 --> 00:06:21,386
Why did the culprit designate me to bring him the money?

84
00:06:21,386 --> 00:06:23,786
The thing is, I don't really know.

85
00:06:23,786 --> 00:06:26,386
Don't you have any idea why?

86
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,886
No, not at all.

87
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:32,686
He's also demanding that the police pull out completely.

88
00:06:32,686 --> 00:06:33,986
He saying that if we ignore his demand,

89
00:06:33,986 --> 00:06:36,086
the life of the employees are at stake.

90
00:06:36,086 --> 00:06:39,986
Since I got ready the 24,000,000 yen that he's demanding,

91
00:06:39,986 --> 00:06:41,986
so I'll leave it to you now.

92
00:06:41,986 --> 00:06:44,686
I can't afford to endanger the lives of my employees.

93
00:06:44,686 --> 00:06:46,186
I understand.

94
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:49,286
You can count on me, Kogoro Mouri.

95
00:06:55,686 --> 00:06:58,886
We will be entering Sumida River in about 10 minutes,

96
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:00,386
but the waves will be getting rough

97
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,886
so please take care not to fall off.

98
00:07:05,186 --> 00:07:06,986
See, take a look at that.

99
00:07:06,986 --> 00:07:09,786
Wow, it looks like something that would come out in the movies.

100
00:07:12,386 --> 00:07:17,086
Tokyo viewed from the river is quite nice too, isn't it?

101
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:19,586
Sendai bori that is up ahead is called so

102
00:07:19,586 --> 00:07:23,286
because the Sendai clan in the old days made it.

103
00:07:23,286 --> 00:07:25,786
Is that right?

104
00:07:29,186 --> 00:07:33,186
The cruiser that M is on board sailed under Minato Bridge just now.

105
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,086
The culprit's planning to get the money somewhere along the river.

106
00:07:36,086 --> 00:07:37,286
Keep your eyes open.

107
00:07:37,286 --> 00:07:38,286
Roger.

108
00:07:40,086 --> 00:07:42,286
The waves of the transceiver

109
00:07:42,286 --> 00:07:43,886
works only in a range of at most, 100 meters.

110
00:07:43,886 --> 00:07:46,586
The culprit should be somewhere in this range.

111
00:07:46,586 --> 00:07:48,786
Sato, where are you now?

112
00:07:48,786 --> 00:07:51,486
We're waiting right across Eitai River.

113
00:07:51,486 --> 00:07:53,486
We confirmed with the cruiser company

114
00:07:53,486 --> 00:07:57,386
and found that it's supposed to go from Sumida River to Ooyoko River.

115
00:07:57,386 --> 00:08:00,686
You two go on ahead to Ooyoko River.

116
00:08:00,686 --> 00:08:01,686
Roger.

117
00:08:04,386 --> 00:08:05,686
Wow. How wonderful.

118
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,186
Amazing.

119
00:08:10,586 --> 00:08:13,586
It's about time you start working for me.

120
00:08:13,586 --> 00:08:16,686
That cruiser is headed for Oojima water gate

121
00:08:16,686 --> 00:08:18,486
and will be going into Ooyoko River.

122
00:08:18,486 --> 00:08:22,986
Then, put the briefcase on the roof of the cruiser.

123
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:25,386
Put it in the center so that it doesn't fall.

124
00:08:25,386 --> 00:08:28,586
Then, go back to your seat and wait for the next contact.

125
00:08:38,386 --> 00:08:40,186
It's not rolling anymore.

126
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,186
Ooyoko River is a canal, that's why.

127
00:08:43,186 --> 00:08:46,486
A local feudal lord made this by order of the Edo Shogunate.

128
00:08:52,586 --> 00:08:53,786
Amazing.

129
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,786
That brat...

130
00:09:00,486 --> 00:09:01,886
Don't you get in my way, brat!

131
00:09:01,886 --> 00:09:03,286
Lower your head!

132
00:09:06,886 --> 00:09:07,886
That was close!

133
00:09:08,886 --> 00:09:11,786
During high tide, water level rises, that the bridge gets so low,

134
00:09:11,786 --> 00:09:14,886
we can't go under it even on this cruiser.

135
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:16,386
I see.

136
00:09:16,386 --> 00:09:18,386
Well, I guess you don't bow so often or lower your head really low

137
00:09:18,386 --> 00:09:21,086
and turn it into a good experience while you're at it.

138
00:09:21,086 --> 00:09:22,086
What did you say?

139
00:09:23,086 --> 00:09:25,586
The briefcase is on the roof.

140
00:09:39,886 --> 00:09:41,286
It's impossible to pull the briefcase

141
00:09:41,286 --> 00:09:43,686
up from the bridge in this crowd people.

142
00:09:43,686 --> 00:09:44,886
Besides...

143
00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:52,386
With so many surveillance cameras all over the place, the more so.

144
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:11,386
Did you wait long?

145
00:10:15,086 --> 00:10:16,086
That was close.

146
00:10:43,586 --> 00:10:45,686
M has entered Heikyu River.

147
00:10:46,786 --> 00:10:49,686
The briefcase is on the roof of the cruiser.

148
00:10:49,686 --> 00:10:52,186
What? Keep your eyes on the cruiser!

149
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:53,286
Roger!

150
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,786
I'll go get the car.

151
00:11:34,286 --> 00:11:36,286
The briefcase is gone!

152
00:11:43,301 --> 00:11:45,301
The briefcase is gone!

153
00:11:47,301 --> 00:11:49,501
Conan? What brings you here?

154
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,001
The briefcase is gone!

155
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,301
-What? -What?

156
00:11:52,301 --> 00:11:54,601
Bad news! We've got to contact the inspector.

157
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:58,801
Darn!

158
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:01,601
Pops!

159
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:04,401
Pops! We've got trouble!

160
00:12:04,401 --> 00:12:06,201
Shut up! Don't bother me!

161
00:12:06,201 --> 00:12:08,801
The briefcase on the roof is gone!

162
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:09,801
What?

163
00:12:12,901 --> 00:12:15,601
It's gone! It's gone! It's gone! It's gone!

164
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:18,001
Hey, look out, sir!

165
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:21,201
The briefcase is gone!

166
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:26,001
Mr. Mouri!

167
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:29,601
How'd he do it?

168
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:33,801
How on earth the culprit take the briefcase?

169
00:12:39,901 --> 00:12:42,401
"Mouri Detective Agency"

170
00:12:44,101 --> 00:12:45,101
In other words,

171
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:47,901
you got instructions over the transceiver?

172
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:51,501
To put the briefcase on the roof after entering Ooyoko River?

173
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:52,501
Yes...

174
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:56,601
Yes.

175
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:59,001
You got nothing, no directions, after that?

176
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:00,001
No.

177
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:06,301
And, by the time you realized it, the briefcase was gone?

178
00:13:06,301 --> 00:13:09,301
Yes, sir. Because he told me to go back to my seat

179
00:13:09,301 --> 00:13:11,401
and wait for further contact.

180
00:13:11,401 --> 00:13:12,801
What a shame.

181
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:14,401
And, Conan...

182
00:13:14,401 --> 00:13:17,501
When did you last see the briefcase?

183
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:19,101
Well...

184
00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:22,101
Over here. Totomi Bridge here.

185
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:26,801
The last we saw of it was Shiomi Bridge here.

186
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:32,501
And you realized that the briefcase was gone at Hamazono Bridge here.

187
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:37,001
In other words, the culprit would have had to take the briefcase

188
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:39,701
from somewhere between Heikyu Bridge and Hamazono Bridge.

189
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:42,801
Mr. Mouri, was there anything you noticed?

190
00:13:44,901 --> 00:13:47,301
I'm very sorry.

191
00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:49,801
It seems like I've caught a cold

192
00:13:49,801 --> 00:13:51,901
That's obvious.

193
00:13:51,901 --> 00:13:53,001
Oh, right.

194
00:13:53,001 --> 00:13:56,901
Bback then, I heard a metallic sound of something banging onto steel.

195
00:13:56,901 --> 00:13:59,201
A metallic sound?

196
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:03,001
If I remember correctly, somewhere around here...

197
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:05,601
I think it was a small bridge.

198
00:14:05,601 --> 00:14:09,401
There were two small boats anchored under the bridge.

199
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:11,301
Were there people on the boats?

200
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:13,401
No, no one.

201
00:14:13,401 --> 00:14:16,701
I heard the sound when the skipper veered the cruiser to the right

202
00:14:16,701 --> 00:14:19,301
to avoid the boats and sailed under the bridge

203
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:22,001
What was that?

204
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:23,801
Maybe we hit a bridge?

205
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:25,201
No way.

206
00:14:25,201 --> 00:14:27,401
If so the cruiser should sway more.

207
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:29,001
I see.

208
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:32,501
That was probably Shigure Bridge.

209
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:35,401
When we were watching from Shiomi Bridge,

210
00:14:35,401 --> 00:14:37,801
Heikyu Bridge was in sight,

211
00:14:37,801 --> 00:14:39,701
but there were no boats.

212
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:43,101
Besides, Ishihama Bridge just ahead of Shigure Bridge

213
00:14:43,101 --> 00:14:45,301
has a water gate right behind it.

214
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:49,001
I don't think you'll get the impression of it being a small bridge.

215
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:50,501
I see.

216
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:53,101
The next bridge is already Hamazono Bridge

217
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,001
so I'm sure that there's no doubt that the metallic sound

218
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:58,001
was heard at Shigure Bridge.

219
00:14:58,001 --> 00:15:00,801
But, I wonder if that metallic sound

220
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:03,101
has anything to do with the case we're dealing with now?

221
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:05,101
Inspector Megure.

222
00:15:05,101 --> 00:15:08,501
This was found near the water of Heikyu Bridge.

223
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:10,901
That's...

224
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:14,401
Mr. Mouri,

225
00:15:14,401 --> 00:15:17,101
is this the briefcase?

226
00:15:18,101 --> 00:15:19,901
No mistake, that's it!

227
00:15:19,901 --> 00:15:22,701
Open it and confirm the inside too.

228
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:24,301
May take a look?

229
00:15:31,801 --> 00:15:36,901
Pops, the cloth of the lid of the briefcase is ripped.

230
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:38,101
What?

231
00:15:39,101 --> 00:15:40,601
According to forensics,

232
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:42,001
just as Conan has mentioned,

233
00:15:42,001 --> 00:15:44,001
the inside of the lid has been ripped off,

234
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:45,401
and further inside,

235
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:48,801
there seems to be a trace of something having been rigged onto it.

236
00:15:48,801 --> 00:15:49,801
What?

237
00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:52,301
Then, does that mean that the culprit used whatever it was

238
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:54,501
that was rigged on to it, to take the briefcase?

239
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:57,701
No, we don't know that yet...

240
00:16:00,101 --> 00:16:01,501
Mr. Mouri?

241
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:02,901
Dad.

242
00:16:02,901 --> 00:16:04,101
Inspector.

243
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:07,601
I've figured out how the culprit had taken the briefcase.

244
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:08,701
Mouri.

245
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,001
He's not nasal anymore?

246
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:12,201
Rats.

247
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:15,101
It flashed upon me, that my nose suddenly unplugged.

248
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:18,801
Never mind that, but inspector...

249
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:21,701
The culprit probably used a strong magnet.

250
00:16:21,701 --> 00:16:23,401
Magnet?

251
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:25,201
The characteristic of Ooyoko River

252
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:28,301
is that the water level greatly changes during high and low tide.

253
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:31,701
The distance between the bridge becomes very narrow.

254
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:33,501
The culprit probably checked the time

255
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:37,101
that the water level rises beforehand

256
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:41,601
and rigged a strong magnet onto the lid of the briefcase.

257
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,801
By doing so, when the cruiser sails

258
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:46,101
under the extremely narrow space of the bridge...

259
00:16:47,801 --> 00:16:49,401
Wait a minute.

260
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:51,101
There are many bridges,

261
00:16:51,101 --> 00:16:53,301
so there's no way of telling which bridge it would attach too, no?

262
00:16:53,301 --> 00:16:59,101
No. So the culprit used an electromagnet

263
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,201
that would generates magnetic force at his convenience.

264
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:05,701
The electromagnet that is made by wrapping

265
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:08,001
a coil around a magnetic material generates magnetic force

266
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:10,301
only when electric current is applied to the coil.

267
00:17:10,301 --> 00:17:13,501
The culprit probably embedded in the lid of the briefcase

268
00:17:13,501 --> 00:17:16,101
an iron bar wrapped with coil and a battery.

269
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:20,801
Then, he installed a remote control switch that enables remote operation.

270
00:17:43,001 --> 00:17:45,601
Finally, after everyone left,

271
00:17:45,601 --> 00:17:48,301
he switched off the power and retrieved the briefcase.

272
00:17:51,201 --> 00:17:54,401
Okay! Based on Mouri's deduction,

273
00:17:54,401 --> 00:17:58,001
re-investigate the vicinity of Ooyoko River and Heikyu River.

274
00:17:58,001 --> 00:17:59,101
-Yes, sir. -Yes sir.

275
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:03,901
Geez, dad...

276
00:18:03,901 --> 00:18:07,601
Your cold will get worse if you sleep in a place like this.

277
00:18:07,601 --> 00:18:11,601
I wonder why the culprit designated pops?

278
00:18:11,601 --> 00:18:13,101
I wonder...

279
00:18:13,101 --> 00:18:16,801
The papers of the cases that pops handled are still here, aren't they?

280
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:19,801
Yeah, I think they're filed.

281
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:22,901
Maybe we'll be able to figure something out by looking at those files.

282
00:18:25,001 --> 00:18:30,301
Maybe that culprit is somebody who has a grudge against dad?

283
00:18:32,101 --> 00:18:33,701
Could be.

284
00:18:44,801 --> 00:18:48,701
Is anything wrong, Ran?

285
00:18:48,701 --> 00:18:51,001
No, it's nothing.

286
00:18:52,701 --> 00:18:54,401
I was just thinking that if it were Shinichi,

287
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:57,301
he would immediately solve a problem like this.

288
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:00,801
Don't worry.

289
00:19:00,801 --> 00:19:02,901
I'll solve it for you.

290
00:19:04,301 --> 00:19:06,601
Just as would be expected of a member of the Youth Detective Squad.

291
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:09,901
Then, shall we solve it, the two of us, in place of dad?

292
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:10,901
Yes.

293
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:14,801
The keyword is New Image.

294
00:19:14,801 --> 00:19:18,701
I'm sure that it has something to do with New Image and pops.

295
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:23,601
"Mouri Detective Agency"

296
00:20:39,801 --> 00:20:41,001
I found it.

297
00:20:41,001 --> 00:20:43,601
Isn't this it?

298
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:45,301
This.

299
00:20:45,301 --> 00:20:48,101
Satoshi Nishizawa, 32 years old.

300
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:53,001
Mechanic engineer for New Image, an import car dealer.

301
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:56,701
There is a request from Kaori Ida, 37 years old,

302
00:20:56,701 --> 00:21:00,201
to find the person who has been stalking her.

303
00:21:00,201 --> 00:21:01,601
As a result of the investigation,

304
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:03,601
it becomes apparent that the stalker is Nishizawa.

305
00:21:03,601 --> 00:21:06,901
There was a court order prohibiting him from going close to her.

306
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:10,101
Thus, he was fired.

307
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:12,601
This is a case of 2 months ago.

308
00:21:12,601 --> 00:21:13,801
What's his address?

309
00:21:13,801 --> 00:21:15,801
Fukagawa, Koto ward.

310
00:21:15,801 --> 00:21:17,701
Isn't this near Ooyoko River?

311
00:21:17,701 --> 00:21:18,701
Yes.

312
00:22:53,101 --> 00:22:54,101
This way.

313
00:22:58,701 --> 00:23:00,501
It's that apartment, isn't it?

314
00:23:00,501 --> 00:23:01,501
Yes.

315
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:09,501
Mr. Nishizawa. Are you in?

316
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:11,101
Mr. Nishizawa!

317
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,701
It seems he's not in.

318
00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:16,701
Yes.

319
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:21,101
It's open.

320
00:23:24,401 --> 00:23:27,201
Mr. Nishizawa, aren't you home?

321
00:23:28,301 --> 00:23:30,001
Mr. Nishizawa!

322
00:23:34,601 --> 00:23:35,801
Conan.

323
00:23:44,901 --> 00:23:46,901
No, Conan.

324
00:23:46,901 --> 00:23:49,201
You shouldn't go into other people's houses without permission.

325
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,620
Next Conan's Hint:

326
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,760
"Flower viewing boat".

327
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,900
Dad, are you okay?

328
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:56,001
I guess he'd like to run to see cherry blossoms, but the only thing that's running is his nose.
