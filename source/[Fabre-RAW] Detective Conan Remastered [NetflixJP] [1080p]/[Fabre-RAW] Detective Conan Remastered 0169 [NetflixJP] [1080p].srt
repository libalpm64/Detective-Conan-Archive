1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,790
Just as flowing water has no form.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,790
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,790
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,690
A Venus is born of a shell.

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,790
But, behind the beauty lies a horrible trick.

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,390
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,390
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,990
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:03,970
"The Kiss of Venus"

10
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,870
"Beika-cho Aquarium"

11
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,470
Wow! Take a look at all of this!

12
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,370
Yeah, true.

13
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,070
Look, Dad!

14
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,070
Over there, see.

15
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,270
I'll bet a show is going to be performed there.

16
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,270
Wow!

17
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,870
Isn't it just wonderful?

18
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,270
A woman's going to coming out of that shell.

19
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,970
My God.

20
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,770
Look at all the people.

21
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,470
Let's go home.

22
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,170
What a thing to say. How rude.

23
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,770
After all we invited here by a fan of yours.

24
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,170
Mr. Mouri.

25
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,770
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

26
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,270
I'm Masato Hayashi, director of performance techniques.

27
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,970
Oh, hello, thank you for inviting us over.

28
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,870
And, who is she may be?

29
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,370
She is the star performer of our show.

30
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,570
Michiko Osawa.

31
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,770
I've been a fan of yours for some time now,

32
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,270
and have been hoping that you would drop by to watch my show.

33
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:26,770
Oh, well, I've always been hoping to watch your show too.

34
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,870
Hey, come on. I thought you said you wanted to go home.

35
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,570
Uh, how long can you hold your breath under water?

36
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:37,770
Gosh, how straightforward can you get?

37
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,070
Oh, I'm sorry.

38
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:46,270
Well, she's really been looking forward seeing the show.

39
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,370
Oh, is that right?

40
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,470
Well, let me see.

41
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,870
Maybe about 4 minutes.

42
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,870
If you're that interested,

43
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,870
would you like me to show you around backstage?

44
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,170
Yes.

45
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,470
Come this way, please.

46
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,970
This is the control room.

47
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,970
All the lights and music used for the show

48
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,170
as well as the operation of machines are all done here.

49
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,070
This is the employees' locker room.

50
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,670
And, this is the make-up room.

51
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,670
This is the room where performers like Ms. Osawa

52
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,970
change outfits and such.

53
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,070
And that door that you see at the end of corridor.

54
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,770
There, you will find the hatch that is connected

55
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,970
to the inside of the shell in aquarium, that you just saw.

56
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,070
-Oh. -Hey, Mr. Hayashi.

57
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,970
I wish you wouldn't tell them so much

58
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,770
about what we have backstage.

59
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,670
You're spoiling my show.

60
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,470
Oh, well, I didn't mean to do so.

61
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,970
Oh, Murakawa.

62
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,070
Let me introduce you all.

63
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,770
Uh, he is the chief of staff, Mr. Murakawa.

64
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,070
He's a veteran of 20 years in this line work.

65
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,670
How do you do?

66
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,470
She is Yuriko Minegishi.

67
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,070
Nice to meet you.

68
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,970
I guess you could say she is our second Venus.

69
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,570
-Oh. -Ms. Minegishi.

70
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,470
You mean you haven't changed outfits yet?

71
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,070
You're performing before me, you know.

72
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,870
I know.

73
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,570
Can't you see that I just came to get changed?

74
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,470
Gosh, she doesn't even have a tinge of professionalism in her.

75
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,970
What a way to act in front of customers.

76
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,570
Besides...

77
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,670
The only Venus we need here is me,

78
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,970
don't you think, Mr. Mouri?

79
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,670
Yes, well...

80
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,770
Well, then, it's about time for me to start getting ready too.

81
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,670
Please enjoy the show.

82
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,970
Well, well, she sure is some woman.

83
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,370
Her father is the president of the Osawa Construction Company.

84
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,370
You mean the one that is famous

85
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,170
for being run by a tyrannical president?

86
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,470
He was also involved in the construction of this aquarium,

87
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,370
but he started pushing himself into the management as well.

88
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,770
That's why his daughter acts the way she does too.

89
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,470
I see.

90
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,070
Uh, it's about time I go to check out the devices, so...

91
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,270
Oh, I'm sorry to have stopped you.

92
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,670
Oh, no problem. Bye.

93
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,270
Shall we start heading back to our seats then?

94
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,670
You go ahead.

95
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,170
That man dropped his towel, so I'll go give it to him.

96
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,670
Oh, Conan.

97
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,670
Excuse me, sir.

98
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,370
You dropped this.

99
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,970
Oh, thank you.

100
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,270
I'm sorry, but my hands are tied just yet.

101
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,670
Can you put in on the shelf over there for me?

102
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,970
Okay.

103
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,570
Do you always check things out like this?

104
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:09,670
Yeah, because people's lives are at stake.

105
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,170
Wow, an important job.

106
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,970
What's this switch?

107
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,370
The red switch at the top

108
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,470
stops the water was from gushing in.

109
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,070
And the blue switch lets the water that accumulates out.

110
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:26,170
Oh, so the water is let in and out from here.

111
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,270
The water is let in from the control room,

112
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,570
but if something happens inside,

113
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,370
and the water can't be stopped, the person will drown, right?

114
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,970
Oh, I see.

115
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,770
Okay, all done.

116
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,170
Go on back to your seat.

117
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,670
The show will begin soon.

118
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,770
Okay.

119
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,070
This place is packed with people.

120
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,770
The show's going to start.

121
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,470
Wow, how beautiful.

122
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,070
I wonder how they trained the fish.

123
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,270
A smelling bag.

124
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,170
See, she's holding something in her right hand.

125
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:29,470
The fish are following the smell from her hand.

126
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,570
Wow.

127
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,070
Next, it's time for Ms. Osawa to come on.

128
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,670
What the...

129
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,570
That's...

130
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,370
The victim is Michiko Osawa.

131
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,170
25 years old.

132
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:17,370
She is the star actress of the water show being performed here.

133
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,870
And, you just happened to be here, Mr. Mouri.

134
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,670
Well, yes, I was invited over.

135
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,270
She seems to have drowned to death.

136
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,270
Drowned?

137
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,970
Which means that she was trapped in shell

138
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,270
and unable to escape, eh?

139
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:41,070
Maybe the machine didn't work. We need to investigate on this.

140
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,270
Her make-up is rubbed off.

141
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:48,170
Inspector Megure, her make-up is scrape off.

142
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,370
Hey, you!

143
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,370
Will you please stay put for a change?

144
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,270
True.

145
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,370
She probably scraped it off somewhere when she drowned.

146
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,570
Then, she probably drowned because her leg hurt.

147
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,770
Why do you think so, Conan?

148
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:08,770
Because there is Band Aid on behind her left knee.

149
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,570
-What? -Oh, he's right.

150
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,870
Let's see.

151
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,670
This is wet compress.

152
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,170
Wet compress?

153
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,670
When the performer stand by and circle the hatch,

154
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,870
the light will be turned on.

155
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,570
After confirming that the light is lit,

156
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,370
I send water into the shell.

157
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:36,070
When the shell is about 80% filled, the diagram of the glows blue,

158
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,270
and the water stops automatically.

159
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,970
Was it working as usual today?

160
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,970
Yes, staff other than myself were operate it in this room too.

161
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,570
So, there's no doubt about it.

162
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:51,570
Does that lady often use wet compresses when she swims?

163
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:56,270
Not you again. How'd you get in here?

164
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:00,570
Was Ms. Osawa using cold compress?

165
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,970
Yes, in the back of her left knee.

166
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,470
What is it?

167
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:09,470
She once hurt her left leg and almost drowned back then.

168
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,670
Did she mention anything on it today?

169
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,470
No, because if she had said her leg hurt,

170
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,870
the show would've been canceled.

171
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:22,870
She may have been hiding the fact that her leg hurt.

172
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,770
Which means...

173
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:28,570
Her leg started aching while she was standing by

174
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,870
and she drowned.

175
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,270
It's hard to believe since she was a professional swimmer,

176
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,070
but it's not impossible.

177
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,670
Yes.

178
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,470
If there was nothing wrong with the shell,

179
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,570
that's very likely.

180
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,770
It is completely water-proof

181
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,070
and nothing abnormal has been detected.

182
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,670
Which means that it would work fine so long

183
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,470
as it is operated correctly?

184
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,070
Yes, even if there were to be a mistake,

185
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,370
as long as this button is pushed,

186
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,570
the water flows out and you can swim on.

187
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:03,670
Then, maybe the button couldn't be for some reason.

188
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,870
What is that?

189
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,670
Officer Takagi.

190
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,670
Conan, you shouldn't be in here.

191
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,070
What is that?

192
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,370
Huh? I wonder.

193
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,670
This is...

194
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,570
foundation.

195
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,870
Why would some like this be here?

196
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,770
So, Ms. Osawa was putting on make-up

197
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,970
until just before she went out to perform?

198
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,270
Yes, probably.

199
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,270
She was always concerned about what the audience thought of her.

200
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:42,070
She used to check her outfit and make until just before standby.

201
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:46,070
Ms. Minegishi, did you come out of the shell

202
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,070
after going in there once?

203
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,070
Just what do you mean by that?

204
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,870
I thought it was concluded that she died is an accident.

205
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,870
After Ms. Minegishi stood by,

206
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,770
water was poured in from the control room,

207
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,270
so I'm sure she couldn't come out to see.

208
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,170
I see.

209
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,870
How about you two?

210
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,870
We were both working in the control room.

211
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,670
Well, maybe I left to go to the rest room.

212
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,070
Hey, Conan.

213
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,470
Just what do you think you're doing there?

214
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,670
Excuse me, whose lipstick is this?

215
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,170
Oh, that's Ms. Osawa's.

216
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,470
She must've been in a super rush to have stood by

217
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,170
leaving it out like this.

218
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,270
She was such a tidy person that it sure.

219
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,770
It's very unusual that she would leave it on without putting it away.

220
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,870
Hey, something dropped.

221
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,470
It's the vinyl that's been peeled of the wet compress.

222
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,170
Her leg probably started to ache suddenly that she panicked.

223
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,770
All she had to do was come and tell me about it.

224
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,770
That's...

225
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,070
I see, I get it.

226
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,970
This is not an accident after all. It's planned murder.

227
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:17,770
And the killer...

228
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,560
Oh, Inspector Megure.

229
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,060
Oh, Officer Takagi, how was it?

230
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,360
Yes, nothing seems to have gone wrong,

231
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,460
be it the operation of the shell or the room.

232
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:44,060
Just to be sure, I am thinking of having him test run it.

233
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,160
And, on the floor of the shell device,

234
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,760
there was one place that was stained foundation.

235
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,760
It matched with the part of Ms. Osawa's cheek

236
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,060
-that had scraped off. -I see.

237
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,260
It probably rubbed off while she was struggling

238
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,160
with the pain in her leg.

239
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,260
There seems to be no doubt that this was an unexpected accident.

240
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,960
Ready here. Anytime you're ready.

241
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,560
Please start.

242
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,260
Okay, please start.

243
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,460
Roger.

244
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,660
It's locked.

245
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,760
Okay, I'm letting the water in.

246
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,960
Okay.

247
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,460
The water is coming in. Everything's fine for now.

248
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,560
Okay, then will you check the emergency drainage device

249
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,660
when you're ready?

250
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,960
Roger.

251
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,360
What's wrong?

252
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,660
The alarm went off

253
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,260
because the water being stopped when inside

254
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,860
means that something is wrong.

255
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,360
I see.

256
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,460
Anything?

257
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,660
No problem. The water has stopped.

258
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,760
The water is being drained now.

259
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,960
Okay, then I'll continue pouring water in.

260
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,660
Everything seems to be working fine.

261
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,260
All we have to do next is shell when it fills up.

262
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,560
Show time, Pops.

263
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,060
The water has stopped in.

264
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,160
The amount of water poured in is also as usual.

265
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,160
Okay. I'm opening the shell now, so finish up.

266
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,160
Good work.

267
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,360
Roger!

268
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,860
We're done.

269
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,060
Everything is fine.

270
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,960
Thank you.

271
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,660
So, this was an unexpected accident after all.

272
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,160
Please wait, Inspector Megure.

273
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,960
That pose is?

274
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,360
This is no accident.

275
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,260
It is none other than a planned murder.

276
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,260
What do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

277
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,660
I just figured it out.

278
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,760
I've figured out the well schemed trick, as well as who did it.

279
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,560
A trick? Who did it?

280
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,960
First, although it had been deduced

281
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,060
that Ms. Osawa went into the shell and felt pain in her leg,

282
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,760
so she struggled and drowned,

283
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,560
as it has been proven just now.

284
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,960
There is an emergency switch that drains the water out

285
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,460
within the shell.

286
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,360
It is hard to believe that Ms. Osawa

287
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,260
who was capable of staying underwater for 4 minutes drowned

288
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,460
because she didn't have the time to push the button.

289
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,860
Furthermore, why would a person like her

290
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,960
who had a strong sense of professionalism,

291
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,160
always concerned what the audience thought of her,

292
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,160
perform with a wet compress on her.

293
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,060
I thought something was a bit funny too.

294
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,660
What do you mean?

295
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,260
Some time ago when she hurt her hand,

296
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,360
although she used a wet compress during practice,

297
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,560
she took it off during her performance.

298
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,660
And besides, when I met her for the first time today,

299
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,560
she was wearing high-heeled shoes.

300
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,960
I don't think a person who has a painful leg

301
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,760
would wear shoes like that.

302
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,160
But, you saw the wet compress on her too, didn't you?

303
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,260
The killer is probably the one who stuck it on her.

304
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,160
Why would the killer do something like that?

305
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,160
Just as Mr. Hayashi had mentioned a while ago.

306
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,660
It seems that Ms. Osawa hurt her left leg in the past.

307
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,260
If the wet compress is on her leg,

308
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,260
we would naturally be led to believe that it caused her to drown.

309
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,260
You mean the killer was trying to distract us from the truth?

310
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,260
That's right.

311
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,760
Then when did the killer stick the wet compress on?

312
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,160
Before the show began.

313
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,760
After sticking the wet compress on her,

314
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,460
the killer carried her over to the shell.

315
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,660
Who on earth is the killer?

316
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,660
I was performing before the audience.

317
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,960
Hayashi and I were working in the control room.

318
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,660
We had no time to make her drown

319
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,760
then, carry her over to the shell.

320
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,260
It takes time to make a person drown to death.

321
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,760
But, if the person were to be put to sleep with medication beforehand,

322
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,360
then carried, it wouldn't require too much time.

323
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,360
So long as you say you're going to the room or something,

324
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,260
no one would be suspicious.

325
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,660
The restroom...

326
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,660
which means...

327
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,160
Yes. Mr. Murakawa.

328
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,060
You!

329
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,960
It can't be.

330
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,160
Mr. Murakawa.

331
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,360
Nonsense!

332
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,060
There is proof.

333
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:20,260
All of Ms. Osawa's cosmetics were out on the dresser

334
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,860
regardless of how tidy she was.

335
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,860
That's proof that she was put to sleep

336
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,260
while she was putting on her make-up.

337
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,760
Besides, foundation that is thought to Ms. Osawa's

338
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,460
was found on the floor of the shell device.

339
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,860
This was because in order to make sure that

340
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,360
Ms. Osawa who was unconscious, drowned to death,

341
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,360
you left her face down on the floor of the shell.

342
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,060
If the foundation had rubbed off when she struggled,

343
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,660
why would it rub off only in one place?

344
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,060
I see.

345
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:56,060
Then, all you had to do was pour water into the shell from here

346
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,260
for Ms. Osawa to drink the water and drown to death.

347
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,060
All only queer assumptions and circumstantial evidence.

348
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,460
No conclusive evidence at all.

349
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:11,660
Don't you already have the conclusive evidence on you?

350
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:18,760
On your back, right by the base of your neck.

351
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,660
Excuse me.

352
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,160
Lipstick.

353
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,460
That's Ms. Osawa's.

354
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:31,260
It probably rubbed off when he carried Ms. Osawa.

355
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,560
But, how on earth did you figure it all?

356
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,560
There seems to be have been some stains on the staff sweat shirts too,

357
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,360
but they seem to have been washed off.

358
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,460
I checked the one that was hung in the waiting room,

359
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,560
and found a slight lipstick stain left on it.

360
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,960
But, you can never tell when I got this on me.

361
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,460
Since the corridor is narrow, it may have rubbed off

362
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,760
when I passed by her.

363
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,060
No, that's not possible.

364
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:01,460
Please take a good look at the lipstick stain.

365
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,060
The shape of the mark of her lips are upside down.

366
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,460
Right.

367
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,360
In other words, he could only have gotten that type of stain

368
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,560
when he let Ms. Osawa who he was carrying down.

369
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,060
Osawa.

370
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,460
It serves her right to die, that lady.

371
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,160
Two years ago,

372
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,960
my wife and child died because they were hit-and-run.

373
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,460
Don't tell me that she was the one who ran over them...

374
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,460
Yes, it was her.

375
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,960
When her father came here,

376
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,760
I heard talking to each other about it.

377
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,660
They were laughing saying that I wasn't aware of anything.

378
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:47,460
She didn't even feel a tinge of guilt!

379
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,760
Not a tinge.

380
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,460
It's so depressing, after were looking forward to seeing the show.

381
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,360
It can't be helped, after all it was homicide.

382
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,960
The show can't go on after murder is committed, I guess.

383
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,660
I've got to cooperate with the investigation too, besides.

384
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,460
True.

385
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,160
I'll take you some place else next time.

386
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,560
How about some place like this?

387
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,160
There are a lot of beautiful ladies in bathing suits too.

388
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,460
Dad.

389
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,660
Hey, watch it, the aquarium.

390
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,860
Come on, I wouldn't really kick you. Only a joke.

391
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,860
Let's go.

392
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,360
I've gone weak in my legs.

393
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,060
Give me a break.

394
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,460
Well, what an energetic elderly woman.

395
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,560
Oh no, a black out?

396
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,960
Next Conan,

397
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,880
"Blind Spot in the Darkness (Part 1)"

398
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,980
Next Conan's Hint:

399
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,780
"Short circuit breaker"

400
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,280
The next episode is about a doctor.

401
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,780
I hate injections and intravenous drips.
