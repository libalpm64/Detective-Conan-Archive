1
00:00:05,037 --> 00:00:06,537
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:06,537 --> 00:00:08,337
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:08,337 --> 00:00:10,037
When The Youth Detective Squad combines its strength,

4
00:00:10,037 --> 00:00:11,737
they could solve the trick of teleportation.

5
00:00:11,737 --> 00:00:13,637
Find the brooch and let Tagaki's love begin.

6
00:00:13,637 --> 00:00:15,137
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:15,137 --> 00:00:17,037
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:17,037 --> 00:00:19,137
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,122 --> 00:01:59,022
After school, on the way home,

10
00:01:59,022 --> 00:02:02,922
we saw Officer Takagi walking into a jewelry store.

11
00:02:04,122 --> 00:02:06,122
We followed him and went inside the jewelry store out of curiosity.

12
00:02:06,122 --> 00:02:09,422
Surprisingly, we bumped into a jewel robber inside the store!

13
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:15,822
Officer Takagi and we chased the robber.

14
00:02:15,822 --> 00:02:18,422
But he jumped off the roof of a building and died!

15
00:02:21,722 --> 00:02:23,122
Do you know him?

16
00:02:23,122 --> 00:02:27,122
Yes. The robber fell on the moving truck,

17
00:02:27,122 --> 00:02:32,622
which was carrying the stuff of Mr. Nekota, the man over there.

18
00:02:32,622 --> 00:02:36,122
Have you met these officers before?

19
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:38,422
No. Why would I have?

20
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:41,422
I've never done anything bad before!

21
00:02:44,522 --> 00:02:46,922
Below that office is his living space.

22
00:02:46,922 --> 00:02:49,922
That office is four stories above which is the ninth floor.

23
00:02:49,922 --> 00:02:51,522
So this house is on the fifth floor.

24
00:02:52,622 --> 00:02:55,722
-What is this? -It's a strange helmet, isn't it?

25
00:02:55,722 --> 00:02:56,722
Hey!

26
00:02:56,722 --> 00:02:58,822
Is that for a sports bicycle?

27
00:02:58,822 --> 00:03:03,022
Yes, I was into triathlon when I was young.

28
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:07,622
Where is the bedroom?

29
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,222
I found it!

30
00:03:11,822 --> 00:03:13,022
It's here!

31
00:03:14,922 --> 00:03:16,822
If my deduction is correct...

32
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:17,922
Then, probably...

33
00:03:21,522 --> 00:03:22,622
It's wet!

34
00:03:23,722 --> 00:03:25,822
Just as I thought, it wasn't a suicide!

35
00:03:27,022 --> 00:03:30,122
Mr. Atomura was murdered by Mr. Nekota,

36
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:33,022
who disguised the murder as a suicide.

37
00:03:37,222 --> 00:03:40,122
With the time lag and the gap between the buildings.

38
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:47,422
"A Jewel Thief Caught Red-Handed (Part 2)"

39
00:03:48,822 --> 00:03:50,222
Anyhow...

40
00:03:50,222 --> 00:03:52,222
It's a concrete fact that Takagi bumped into this robber

41
00:03:52,222 --> 00:03:54,322
in the jewelry store and chased him.

42
00:03:54,322 --> 00:03:57,022
Chased him up to the roof of the building.

43
00:03:57,022 --> 00:03:58,022
But Takagi just let him jump off the building

44
00:03:58,022 --> 00:04:00,722
and die right in front of him.

45
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:03,222
It's a hard fact.

46
00:04:03,222 --> 00:04:05,922
Right. It seems more than just a coincidence though.

47
00:04:05,922 --> 00:04:08,622
The robber crashed onto a moving truck

48
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:11,722
which was helping the office transfer of the company

49
00:04:11,722 --> 00:04:14,122
that he used to work for but was fired recently.

50
00:04:14,122 --> 00:04:17,422
Yet, it seems there's no doubt about that suicide.

51
00:04:21,022 --> 00:04:24,322
Then, I guess that's it for today.

52
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:26,722
Sorry, Mr. Nekota,

53
00:04:26,722 --> 00:04:29,022
we need you to come down to the station later.

54
00:04:29,022 --> 00:04:31,222
What? Why do I need to?

55
00:04:31,222 --> 00:04:34,122
Well, we need to ask you some questions

56
00:04:34,122 --> 00:04:36,022
because you were Mr. Atomura's former boss.

57
00:04:36,022 --> 00:04:38,622
Things like what kind of person he was or whether he had financial problems

58
00:04:38,622 --> 00:04:39,822
and all that.

59
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:43,822
"Sakanobu Nekota (51)" -Okay, I understand.

60
00:04:43,822 --> 00:04:47,522
Down a little! Down...

61
00:04:47,522 --> 00:04:49,122
Just a little more!

62
00:04:50,622 --> 00:04:51,822
It's cold!

63
00:04:52,922 --> 00:04:55,622
Guys, what are you doing?

64
00:04:55,622 --> 00:04:57,022
Nothing!

65
00:04:58,522 --> 00:05:01,422
By the way, I have questions.

66
00:05:01,422 --> 00:05:02,422
Questions?

67
00:05:02,422 --> 00:05:03,422
Right.

68
00:05:03,422 --> 00:05:05,722
A couple of questions for Mr. Nekota.

69
00:05:09,222 --> 00:05:10,422
For me?

70
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:27,522
I remember what you said to Officer Takagi

71
00:05:27,522 --> 00:05:29,822
when you first came to the scene of the suicide.

72
00:05:29,822 --> 00:05:34,422
You said, "Call your friends and do what you have to do. Just be quick!"

73
00:05:34,422 --> 00:05:35,822
Right.

74
00:05:35,822 --> 00:05:38,222
I'm wondering why you said that.

75
00:05:38,222 --> 00:05:40,922
Well, you know, I got a schedule.

76
00:05:40,922 --> 00:05:42,122
We're not talking about that!

77
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:45,222
We're asking, how did you know that this

78
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:48,922
Mr. Ordinary with the boring polo-shirt,

79
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:51,522
was actually...

80
00:05:51,522 --> 00:05:54,022
was actually a police officer?

81
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:55,522
That's what the question means!

82
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:04,722
Yeah, I mean, why not?

83
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:06,722
A person died, right?

84
00:06:06,722 --> 00:06:09,722
Isn't it natural to think that the police are here?

85
00:06:09,722 --> 00:06:12,022
Yeah, but remember what you actually said?

86
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:14,822
You asked, "What's going on?"

87
00:06:15,922 --> 00:06:19,722
And you also said that you never met Officer Takagi before!

88
00:06:20,822 --> 00:06:21,922
I see.

89
00:06:21,922 --> 00:06:24,122
You didn't know about the situation,

90
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:25,722
and neither ever met Takagi before.

91
00:06:25,722 --> 00:06:28,522
It's something that you knew that he is a police officer.

92
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:31,922
That was probably the atmosphere that made me think so!

93
00:06:31,922 --> 00:06:34,322
You know, something bad happened,

94
00:06:34,322 --> 00:06:37,922
so I just felt the police were here.

95
00:06:37,922 --> 00:06:40,922
Fair enough, next question then!

96
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:44,622
It's been a while since we got here.

97
00:06:44,622 --> 00:06:48,222
But why are you not getting mad at us?

98
00:06:54,322 --> 00:06:56,022
We're kids, you know?

99
00:06:56,022 --> 00:06:59,222
You might have thought that we're officers if we're adults.

100
00:06:59,222 --> 00:07:02,122
But we're kid and you just let us in without saying anything to us.

101
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:04,222
A normal person would say,

102
00:07:04,222 --> 00:07:08,422
"Who the heck are those kids?"

103
00:07:08,422 --> 00:07:09,922
Oh, that...

104
00:07:09,922 --> 00:07:12,422
You didn't say anything,

105
00:07:12,422 --> 00:07:15,522
because you knew us, right?

106
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:20,722
You knew that we were important witnesses of the jewel robbery.

107
00:07:26,922 --> 00:07:28,622
Is that true?

108
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:30,122
-No. -Wait a minute.

109
00:07:30,122 --> 00:07:32,022
You knew that I was a police officer.

110
00:07:32,022 --> 00:07:36,022
And you also knew that these kids were involved in the robbery.

111
00:07:38,322 --> 00:07:39,322
It can't be!

112
00:07:39,322 --> 00:07:42,022
"Put the jewels in this bag!" -The jewel robber!

113
00:07:42,022 --> 00:07:44,222
It was you, wasn't it?

114
00:07:44,222 --> 00:07:45,822
It's possible.

115
00:07:45,822 --> 00:07:47,522
If that is true,

116
00:07:47,522 --> 00:07:50,722
then it will answer Mitsuhiko's questions.

117
00:07:50,722 --> 00:07:52,122
Oh, please!

118
00:07:52,122 --> 00:07:54,222
Don't you remember?

119
00:07:54,222 --> 00:07:57,922
The robber jumped off the building opposite here

120
00:07:57,922 --> 00:08:00,522
and crashed onto the moving truck!

121
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,822
Let's say I was the robber.

122
00:08:02,822 --> 00:08:07,022
Then where did I go, after jumping off the building?

123
00:08:07,022 --> 00:08:11,722
Isn't it Atomura who fell on the truck?

124
00:08:13,022 --> 00:08:16,022
Also, I'm already 51 years old.

125
00:08:16,022 --> 00:08:18,322
Do you think I have the body to pull away from a police officer

126
00:08:18,322 --> 00:08:21,122
and run up to the roof of a building?

127
00:08:23,822 --> 00:08:25,022
Triathlon!

128
00:08:25,022 --> 00:08:26,122
What?

129
00:08:27,622 --> 00:08:31,522
If you're still into that iron man race,

130
00:08:31,522 --> 00:08:33,322
then that's probably nothing to you, right?

131
00:08:35,422 --> 00:08:37,922
Is that you, Conan?

132
00:08:37,922 --> 00:08:40,822
I was wondering where you were.

133
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:43,722
Now, where are you, Conan?

134
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:45,722
I'm in the building opposite!

135
00:08:45,722 --> 00:08:47,522
The robber jumped off, right?

136
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:50,922
Now I'm going up the stairs to the roof where the robber jumped off!

137
00:08:50,922 --> 00:08:52,722
There's something I wanted to try.

138
00:08:52,722 --> 00:08:55,422
So I told them to throw the questions until I'm ready!

139
00:08:55,422 --> 00:08:57,722
What is it, then?

140
00:09:08,022 --> 00:09:10,222
Can you see me from there?

141
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,722
Yeah, I can see you.

142
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:19,822
But what are you exactly trying to do?

143
00:09:19,822 --> 00:09:21,722
Hey, don't you remember?

144
00:09:21,722 --> 00:09:26,022
I mean, about what the lady living right above that house said.

145
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:27,022
She woke up in 2 am midnight

146
00:09:27,022 --> 00:09:29,822
because she heard a noise from the window.

147
00:09:29,822 --> 00:09:32,322
As she looked at the window,

148
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:37,922
there was a shadow of a thin long stick on the curtain.

149
00:09:37,922 --> 00:09:39,822
I think I got the mystery behind it,

150
00:09:39,822 --> 00:09:42,222
and now I'm going to show that to you all!

151
00:09:42,222 --> 00:09:43,722
Conan?

152
00:09:43,722 --> 00:09:45,222
Okay, that's enough!

153
00:09:45,222 --> 00:09:47,822
I'm helping you guys because it's my former staff

154
00:09:47,822 --> 00:09:50,022
who robbed and killed himself!

155
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:53,722
It looks like these kids really want me to be the robber.

156
00:09:53,722 --> 00:09:55,722
But it's only kid's shallow cleverness after all.

157
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:58,422
I can't believe you're actually listening to them!

158
00:09:59,722 --> 00:10:01,722
Again, like I said,

159
00:10:01,722 --> 00:10:03,122
if I was the robber,

160
00:10:03,122 --> 00:10:06,022
then how did I vanish after jumping off the building?

161
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,122
It's impossible! There's no way I could've done it!

162
00:10:09,122 --> 00:10:10,622
Unless I have supernatural powers

163
00:10:10,622 --> 00:10:13,922
to use teleportation or something!

164
00:10:15,422 --> 00:10:16,422
Yes, you can.

165
00:10:16,422 --> 00:10:17,422
What?

166
00:10:28,922 --> 00:10:32,422
You can do it without supernatural power.

167
00:10:32,422 --> 00:10:33,922
Just like that!

168
00:10:33,922 --> 00:10:35,222
Conan?

169
00:10:36,322 --> 00:10:38,822
How did you get here?

170
00:10:38,822 --> 00:10:40,122
I just used this rope

171
00:10:40,122 --> 00:10:42,022
that I borrowed from the people at moving company.

172
00:10:44,422 --> 00:10:46,522
Rope?

173
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:48,022
First of all, you measure the length

174
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,122
between the balcony of old office in ninth floor

175
00:10:50,122 --> 00:10:53,822
and the balcony of this house that four floor below it.

176
00:10:53,822 --> 00:10:56,222
Next, you get a rope twice the lengths

177
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:59,122
and put it through the handrail of the balcony in the old office.

178
00:10:59,122 --> 00:11:01,822
Then tie both ends to make a loop!

179
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:04,822
After that, you connect a little loop to the rope

180
00:11:04,822 --> 00:11:06,822
so it can carry your body.

181
00:11:06,822 --> 00:11:09,522
You throw the rope with the little loop from the balcony

182
00:11:09,522 --> 00:11:11,822
to the roof of the building opposite,

183
00:11:11,822 --> 00:11:13,522
then you're all set!

184
00:11:13,522 --> 00:11:15,322
All you need to do is to rob the jewelry shop

185
00:11:15,322 --> 00:11:20,322
and pretend that you are being chased up to the roof of the building.

186
00:11:20,322 --> 00:11:22,422
There, you cover the rope with the long raincoat,

187
00:11:22,422 --> 00:11:25,622
with the little loop around your waist and jump off the roof.

188
00:11:31,322 --> 00:11:37,022
This brings you straight down to this balcony.

189
00:11:37,022 --> 00:11:39,722
After which you can hid the rope away

190
00:11:39,722 --> 00:11:41,822
by untying the knot.

191
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:47,022
I see.

192
00:11:47,022 --> 00:11:49,222
I'm actually surprised that you are not hurt at all.

193
00:11:49,222 --> 00:11:52,022
The impact must've been violent when you landed on the balcony.

194
00:11:52,022 --> 00:11:55,722
Just like the robber, I was wearing a helmet.

195
00:11:55,722 --> 00:11:57,222
And also right before the impact,

196
00:11:57,222 --> 00:11:59,922
I blew up a soccer ball with this ball-ejection belt Dr. Agasa invented,

197
00:11:59,922 --> 00:12:03,022
in order to absorb the impact.

198
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,022
That's why I'm totally fine!

199
00:12:09,222 --> 00:12:12,722
In Mr. Nekota's case, he set the bed mattresses in the balcony,

200
00:12:12,722 --> 00:12:15,022
in order to absorb the impact.

201
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:38,679
Mattresses?

202
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:41,779
Yeah, they were wet when I checked them a little while ago!

203
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,379
I see! Because they were exposed to the rain, right?

204
00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:54,479
Then, Mrs. Isaka saw and heard the shadow and noise that night,

205
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:58,079
because you were rehearsing this trick.

206
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,279
Wait a minute!

207
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,779
There was a dead body on the moving truck

208
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:05,179
when you guys looked down right after the robber jumped off, right?

209
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:07,879
How would you explain this?

210
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:11,179
He was on the moving truck from the beginning.

211
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:17,079
The truck was parked in the back of this building

212
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:20,079
in order to move things out of the old office above.

213
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:22,879
Probably...

214
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:25,379
you told Mr. Atomura to help move, or something like that.

215
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:43,979
Then you pushed him over the window of your old office.

216
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:47,679
Yeah, I remember you said,

217
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,979
the whole ninth floor was your old office.

218
00:13:51,979 --> 00:13:53,079
So it was possible to drop him

219
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:55,779
on the truck even if it was parked in the back alley.

220
00:13:55,779 --> 00:13:57,379
Well, what about the noise?

221
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:58,879
Well, someone would hear the noise,

222
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,079
if a person falls on the truck, right?

223
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,479
No, because there is water supply work around here,

224
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:07,979
and it doesn't end until evening everyday.

225
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:16,679
It's likely that the the water supply work shut off the noise.

226
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:18,679
I'm sure there was to the truck when the body fell.

227
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:22,079
So some movers may have noticed something.

228
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,279
Yes, and that's why you told everybody

229
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,979
including the driver to come up to the office, right?

230
00:14:25,979 --> 00:14:29,179
Because you wanted to tell them which things go first and stuff...

231
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:34,079
The moving people told me that they had to wait for a while in the doorway.

232
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,179
That was probably when you pushed Mr. Atomura over the window,

233
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:39,079
and threw the rope to the other building.

234
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,679
And then, you closed the blinds!

235
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:46,579
So that nobody would see the trick when it came in to the office!

236
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:50,179
I see. So, to sum it up.

237
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:52,679
First of all, you told the movers

238
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:54,479
including the driver to come up to the old office,

239
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:57,079
which was on the top floor of this building.

240
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:58,879
Then, while you kept them waiting in the doorway.

241
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:01,079
You pushed Mr. Atomura over onto the moving truck

242
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:02,779
which was parked in the back of this building.

243
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:07,379
Next, you threw the rope to the roof of the opposite building.

244
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:10,379
And then, while the movers were moving the stuff

245
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:13,379
from the old to the new office,

246
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,679
"Put the jewels in this bag!" -you robbed the jewelry store!

247
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,679
Then Officer Takagi chased you up to the roof of the new office building.

248
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:22,679
All of these were done just to make this incident look like

249
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,579
the robber committed suicide

250
00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:27,979
after being chased by a police officer!

251
00:15:27,979 --> 00:15:29,779
You got that right! Also, when he jumped off,

252
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:31,579
he dropped the bag with the jewelries

253
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:34,079
and the spare helmet which he left on the roof beforehand.

254
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,979
As these things hit the truck,

255
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:44,179
the people would notice that something fell on the truck!

256
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:48,679
That's probably why the helmet wasn't on Mr. Atomura's head!

257
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:51,379
So the robber smiled when I told him,

258
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:53,479
that I was from the police.

259
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:00,179
Because he needed someone to chase him

260
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:05,179
and someone to witness the suicide on the roof.

261
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:08,079
Yeah. If you weren't there,

262
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,079
he would've probably waited until other police officer came

263
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,379
to the jewelry shop.

264
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:17,779
Talk about a trick that is unbelievably reliant on luck.

265
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:19,779
Until you jumped off the building,

266
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,379
surprisingly no neighbors or passersby

267
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:25,279
actually saw the rope or the dead body.

268
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,979
Well, I guess it was the sloppiness of your plan that

269
00:16:27,979 --> 00:16:29,979
made it possible to solve even for kids.

270
00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:32,579
It wasn't just his luck that people went blind!

271
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:33,979
What?

272
00:16:33,979 --> 00:16:35,679
It was because of this weather!

273
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:40,079
You mean the rain?

274
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,079
I get it! When it's raining, people put up their umbrella

275
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:44,779
and stay away from balcony.

276
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:46,479
As long as people hold their umbrella,

277
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:48,779
they won't see what's above their head.

278
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,679
Likewise, as long as people stay away from balcony,

279
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:53,479
they won't see what's below.

280
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,679
Plus, the mover used the backstreet when they moved the truck

281
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:59,579
and there were not many passersby on that street.

282
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:00,779
Under this circumstance,

283
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:04,579
you would have been the unluckiest person to make people see those things.

284
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:05,679
That's true.

285
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,779
Yeah, but still,

286
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:12,979
it was a coincidence that he took action on a rainy day, right?

287
00:17:12,979 --> 00:17:14,979
It wasn't a coincidence!

288
00:17:14,979 --> 00:17:17,879
You canceled moving twice

289
00:17:17,879 --> 00:17:19,779
and postponed it to today, right?

290
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:23,579
Now, all we need is evidence.

291
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,679
That, I think is somewhere in this house

292
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,879
or around this building. I'm pretty sure!

293
00:17:28,879 --> 00:17:30,079
Because Mr. Nekota showed up at the scene of the suicide

294
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,679
soon after the robber jumped off.

295
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,979
So it must be somewhere around here!

296
00:17:35,979 --> 00:17:38,979
The evidence includes the rope, helmet and raincoat that he used.

297
00:17:38,979 --> 00:17:40,779
Also the thing that he picked up

298
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:43,079
and put in his pocket at the jewelry shop.

299
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,779
And the brooch that I was going to buy.

300
00:17:51,979 --> 00:17:53,479
I see.

301
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:56,979
Now, it's whether you hid them or dumped them.

302
00:17:56,979 --> 00:17:59,579
The helmet and raincoat are somewhere in the same place together,

303
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:03,479
since you didn't have enough time to go far.

304
00:18:03,479 --> 00:18:06,479
We'll probably find the raincoat with that brooch,

305
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:10,879
as well as the helmet with your fingerprints and hair on it.

306
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:13,879
Mr. Nekota.

307
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:18,279
I think it's time you confess.

308
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:36,279
I don't understand why did you have to take that brooch?

309
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:40,479
Redemption. I guess?

310
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:42,379
Redemption?

311
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:46,379
My company was heavily in the red.

312
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:51,379
It was necessary to fire those who were close to their retirement age

313
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:53,779
and those who were on a decline work-wise.

314
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,779
He happened to be one of those people.

315
00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:04,279
I will spill the secret if you fire me.

316
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:06,179
The things this company has been hiding.

317
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,379
You know, about the deceptive food labeling.

318
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:13,679
All I'm asking is for is you to let me stay here until my retirement age.

319
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,979
All I need is a life in which I can afford a brooch

320
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:18,679
like this for my wife's birthday.

321
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:21,279
Well, my wife might ask me to buy her jewelry

322
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:24,879
that is more expensive than this, after my retirement age.

323
00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:27,679
But for now, you don't need to worry about that, President.

324
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:30,179
That's why you killed him.

325
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:32,379
Yes.

326
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:36,779
I thought I would be in a morass if I let him keep blackmailing me.

327
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:39,579
But, why that brooch?

328
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:44,179
I was thinking of giving it to his wife on her birthday.

329
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:48,779
And saying it was a present that he left with me before his death.

330
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:51,879
In fact, it's true that he'd been working very hard

331
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:54,979
since the company was established.

332
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:00,879
And not only have I made such person a criminal

333
00:20:00,879 --> 00:20:05,679
but also killed him, I just wanted to run away from the sense of guilt.

334
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,979
So I impulsively took the brooch.

335
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,379
It's ironic. The brooch was supposed to help me flee,

336
00:20:22,379 --> 00:20:25,079
but it actually helped you guys arrest me.

337
00:21:57,879 --> 00:22:01,179
All right. So where is the raincoat with that brooch?

338
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:04,479
It's in the closet in my bedroom.

339
00:22:04,479 --> 00:22:06,079
Did you hear that, Officer Sato?

340
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:07,279
Please go and check!

341
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:08,779
Oh, okay.

342
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:15,579
I found it!

343
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:18,279
This wet one, right?

344
00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:22,479
I'm pretty sure you'll like it!

345
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:28,179
It took at a long time for Officer Takagi to decide!

346
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:30,479
It looks amazing even without diamonds!

347
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:33,979
I'm surprised he has pretty good taste.

348
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:35,479
Why don't you take a look?

349
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:40,879
Yes.

350
00:22:40,879 --> 00:22:43,479
Officer Sato. Please take a look at it!

351
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,779
That must be it!

352
00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:49,379
Trust me. Miwako was staring at this brooch.

353
00:22:49,379 --> 00:22:51,579
She wasn't even blinking at all!

354
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:54,379
It's a perfect present for her, isn't it?

355
00:22:54,379 --> 00:22:57,279
But you didn't hear this from me, okay?

356
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:00,279
Look, coincidence makes girls believe in destiny

357
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,879
and that's where the love deepens!

358
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,179
Let us deepen...

359
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:07,779
Our love story.

360
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:09,679
Oh?

361
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,779
This is...

362
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:16,279
A brooch.

363
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:18,779
This is the brooch Yumi wanted!

364
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:24,679
-Officer Yumi? -Yeah.

365
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:27,179
She was all hyper when she saw this in a magazine.

366
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:28,479
Speaking of jewelries,

367
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:31,779
I think Yumi was wearing a bracelet that looked just like

368
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:34,379
the one that I gave you a few days ago.

369
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,979
Oh, that! I lent it to her!

370
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,379
Cause she said she'd been looking

371
00:23:39,379 --> 00:23:41,079
for a bracelet just like that.

372
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:47,279
I'm not interested in those shiny things at all.

373
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,479
This necklace looks fabulous!

374
00:23:54,579 --> 00:23:55,679
All right!

375
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,779
I'm gonna try Lieutenant Takano next time.

376
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:33,806
Next Conan's Hint:

377
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,606
"Raging bull"

378
00:24:36,606 --> 00:24:38,206
Next time, I'll get what's best for her.

379
00:24:38,206 --> 00:24:39,306
What? A cow?

380
00:24:39,306 --> 00:24:40,506
It's no good?
