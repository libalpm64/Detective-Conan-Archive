1
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:07,514
But Ran, you really are unrivaled!

2
00:00:07,514 --> 00:00:11,314
Having won the Kanto Karate championship and all!

3
00:00:11,314 --> 00:00:13,214
It was all thanks to the "Rounding Heel Kick"

4
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:16,514
my elder, Kazuha taught me!

5
00:00:16,514 --> 00:00:18,814
I feel sorry for her opponent.

6
00:00:18,814 --> 00:00:21,014
Well then, today I'll treat you

7
00:00:21,014 --> 00:00:23,414
to the cake buffet at Haido Hotel as promised,

8
00:00:23,414 --> 00:00:25,014
so eat and get stronger!

9
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:29,514
I'll be sure to eat a lot and get super strong!

10
00:00:29,514 --> 00:00:31,514
Won't you get fat instead?

11
00:00:51,214 --> 00:00:52,914
If all the cases are men,

12
00:00:52,914 --> 00:00:54,714
all hidden mysteries are women.

13
00:00:54,714 --> 00:00:56,714
Could he be Shinichi's new rival?

14
00:00:56,714 --> 00:00:58,914
A handsome mysterious detective appears!

15
00:00:58,914 --> 00:01:00,514
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:01:00,514 --> 00:01:02,041
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:01:02,214 --> 00:01:04,514
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

18
00:02:28,127 --> 00:02:34,133
"Deduction Showdown at the Haunted Hotel (Part 1)"

19
00:02:34,516 --> 00:02:36,135
So?

20
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:39,116
What did Shinichi say?

21
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:41,716
When you told him about your victory...

22
00:02:41,716 --> 00:02:44,416
you also gave him your answer to that, right?

23
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,716
What answer?

24
00:02:45,716 --> 00:02:49,516
The answer to that guy's confession in London!

25
00:02:49,516 --> 00:02:53,516
I did inform him about my victory, but...

26
00:02:53,516 --> 00:02:56,155
not my reply to that.

27
00:02:56,155 --> 00:02:59,016
Since I also only reported my victory through email,

28
00:02:59,016 --> 00:03:02,161
I guess I just feel uneasy talking to him directly.

29
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:04,816
What the Flipping Heck, Lady?

30
00:03:04,816 --> 00:03:07,316
Don't you realize how many days it's been since then?

31
00:03:07,316 --> 00:03:11,116
Well, how many days?

32
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:13,416
I bet Shinichi is now like that.

33
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:18,177
Oh, Ran, why hasn't she responded to my feelings?

34
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:22,181
Don't tell me she has someone else in her heart?

35
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:25,616
Oh, no, if that's the case, I'm doomed!

36
00:03:25,616 --> 00:03:27,316
No choice but to cry!

37
00:03:27,316 --> 00:03:30,189
Cry until these tears are used up!

38
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:32,216
He's probably depressed with those thoughts.

39
00:03:32,216 --> 00:03:33,816
No way.

40
00:03:33,816 --> 00:03:36,216
Come on, you think I'm like that?

41
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,616
If you take it too slow,

42
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:40,616
Shinichi may have a change of heart!

43
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:42,516
His attitude is kind of...

44
00:03:42,516 --> 00:03:44,816
but he's surprisingly popular, see?

45
00:03:44,816 --> 00:03:46,616
"Kind of"?

46
00:03:46,616 --> 00:03:52,211
One day, a powerful rival suddenly appear you know.

47
00:03:53,516 --> 00:03:56,716
Pervert! This guy's a groper!

48
00:03:56,716 --> 00:03:58,216
No, I'm not..

49
00:03:58,216 --> 00:04:00,216
Don't act all innocent!

50
00:04:00,216 --> 00:04:02,221
You touched my butt just now!

51
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,223
Ran, it's payback time!

52
00:04:05,316 --> 00:04:06,516
Wait.

53
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,516
I'm done for, if I get hit!

54
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:26,616
As expected of Kanto's champ.

55
00:04:28,016 --> 00:04:29,516
Great moves!

56
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:31,316
Jeet Kune Do!

57
00:04:31,316 --> 00:04:32,716
Ran.

58
00:04:32,716 --> 00:04:34,253
Sonoko, stay back.

59
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:35,616
This pervert is strong.

60
00:04:35,616 --> 00:04:38,516
Oh, if you would let me explain!

61
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:39,816
I'm absolutely...

62
00:04:39,816 --> 00:04:42,016
This person's not a pervert!

63
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,216
Because I saw it!

64
00:04:45,216 --> 00:04:47,916
I saw how that person seized the hand responsible

65
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,916
for touching Sonoko's butt.

66
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:54,716
And then that's why Sonoko mistook that person's hand.

67
00:04:54,716 --> 00:04:56,716
For, this.

68
00:04:56,716 --> 00:04:57,716
No.

69
00:04:57,716 --> 00:04:59,516
So the pervert...

70
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:01,716
was you?

71
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,316
I'm so sorry!

72
00:05:09,316 --> 00:05:11,416
Forgive me!

73
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:14,293
Never show yourself again, idiot!

74
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:16,616
I'm so sorry!

75
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,216
I almost kicked you without even making sure.

76
00:05:19,216 --> 00:05:20,916
No problem, no problem!

77
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,916
I'm just glad we've cleared up our misunderstanding.

78
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,305
On second look, what a hot guy!

79
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:27,516
Besides...

80
00:05:27,516 --> 00:05:30,316
Since you're my type,

81
00:05:30,316 --> 00:05:32,311
I'll forgive you.

82
00:05:32,516 --> 00:05:35,316
What the heck was that?

83
00:05:35,316 --> 00:05:38,317
The pervert's victim was me, you know.

84
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:40,016
I'm joking.

85
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:41,516
Where you headed?

86
00:05:41,516 --> 00:05:43,216
To Haido Hotel.

87
00:05:43,216 --> 00:05:44,816
What a coincidence!

88
00:05:44,816 --> 00:05:47,516
I'm headed to that hotel too.

89
00:05:47,516 --> 00:05:49,316
Are you really?

90
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:52,916
You'd better not be making that up, jerk!

91
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:56,335
Thank you for earlier, little boy!

92
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,516
"Haido Hotel"

93
00:06:01,516 --> 00:06:04,343
Oh, no? You have no vacancies?

94
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:07,116
How come? I made a reservation, you know!

95
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,116
My sincere apologies.

96
00:06:09,116 --> 00:06:10,349
We should have declined,

97
00:06:10,516 --> 00:06:12,616
but our oversight caused the problem.

98
00:06:12,616 --> 00:06:16,016
Well, it sure seems he really has some business with the hotel.

99
00:06:16,016 --> 00:06:18,357
Then, any other rooms available?

100
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:20,116
About that...

101
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:22,916
We are currently renovating our hotel annex,

102
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,416
so we have fewer rooms available and are now all occupied.

103
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:28,016
Isn't there anything you can do?

104
00:06:28,016 --> 00:06:30,369
Say, let's hurry and go eat some cake.

105
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:32,371
I'm really hungry.

106
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:34,016
All right.

107
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:36,375
Still, isn't he so cool?

108
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,377
And as strong as you, Ran!

109
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:44,383
If he fought with Makoto, I wonder who would be stronger at Karate?

110
00:06:44,616 --> 00:06:46,916
That wasn't Karate.

111
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,716
That was Jeet Kune Do.

112
00:06:48,716 --> 00:06:50,916
"Jeet Kune Do"

113
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,391
Movie star Bruce Lee

114
00:06:52,616 --> 00:06:55,216
took the art of Kung Fu he had been practicing as a child.

115
00:06:55,216 --> 00:06:57,416
And combined it with boxing, judo, wrestling,

116
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,716
savate, aikido and other forms of fighting

117
00:07:00,716 --> 00:07:02,401
to develop this martial art!

118
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:04,916
But, it has a number of attacks that target vital points

119
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:08,116
such as the eyes and throat, so it's pretty fierce.

120
00:07:08,116 --> 00:07:11,316
As usual, you know all kinds of weird things!

121
00:07:11,316 --> 00:07:15,416
Regardless, where are they having the cake buffet?

122
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:19,116
We've come to a place where there's somehow nobody around.

123
00:07:19,116 --> 00:07:23,916
On the net, it says it's at the cafe on the second floor.

124
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:27,016
Then, let's go to the second floor and take a look!

125
00:07:27,016 --> 00:07:29,216
There are elevators over there.

126
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:34,016
Oh, where are you going, little boy?

127
00:07:34,016 --> 00:07:36,435
To the cake buffet on the second floor.

128
00:07:36,616 --> 00:07:39,716
Then, you can't get there using this elevator.

129
00:07:39,716 --> 00:07:41,916
This one goes to the annex.

130
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,216
The annex?

131
00:07:43,216 --> 00:07:47,016
But didn't they say the annex was under renovation?

132
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:49,016
Sorry for troubling you.

133
00:07:49,016 --> 00:07:50,449
No problem.

134
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:53,516
We should help each other when in need!

135
00:07:56,455 --> 00:07:58,457
Mrs. Hirukawa!

136
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:00,459
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

137
00:08:00,616 --> 00:08:02,916
How'd it go with him?

138
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:06,916
At first he was drunk and shouting curses as usual, but...

139
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,816
After I scolded him severely, he started crying.

140
00:08:09,816 --> 00:08:11,716
He cried?

141
00:08:11,716 --> 00:08:12,471
Yeah.

142
00:08:12,716 --> 00:08:14,116
He said that, after he had sobered up,

143
00:08:14,116 --> 00:08:16,016
he'd apologize to everyone and admit his sins,

144
00:08:16,016 --> 00:08:17,816
so he'd like us to go to his room.

145
00:08:17,816 --> 00:08:19,716
Really, now?

146
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:22,916
But could he just be planning to spew nonsense

147
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,483
to dodge our question?

148
00:08:24,716 --> 00:08:26,816
In order to get us off his back.

149
00:08:26,816 --> 00:08:30,216
Good point. He might say that

150
00:08:30,216 --> 00:08:32,491
he doesn't remember saying anything of the sort

151
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:33,816
if we ask him about it later on.

152
00:08:33,816 --> 00:08:37,516
Then, why don't we record this repentance?

153
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:41,416
That way, the other victims could hear it as well.

154
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:45,516
But, I don't have any recording devices with me.

155
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:46,916
Me neither.

156
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,116
In that case, let's take my car

157
00:08:49,116 --> 00:08:51,216
and the three of us can buy one!

158
00:08:51,216 --> 00:08:55,316
Since he said it'd be a while before he sobered up.

159
00:08:55,316 --> 00:08:57,016
And we should be able to find

160
00:08:57,016 --> 00:08:59,616
at least one electronics shop in this area, right?

161
00:08:59,616 --> 00:09:00,916
You're right.

162
00:09:02,516 --> 00:09:06,525
No way! You're cutting off the line for the cake buffet?

163
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:10,216
Yes. More customers than we'd expected came,

164
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,516
"Cake Buffet Now Closed" -so there weren't enough cakes.

165
00:09:11,516 --> 00:09:13,216
If you're going to hold a cake buffet,

166
00:09:13,216 --> 00:09:15,716
you should prepare a whole lot and go out with a bang!

167
00:09:15,716 --> 00:09:17,316
A bang!

168
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,116
What was that sound just now?

169
00:09:21,116 --> 00:09:22,916
Could be the parking lot?

170
00:09:31,316 --> 00:09:32,551
Hold on!

171
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:38,916
This is bad.

172
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,916
Call an ambulance!

173
00:09:47,316 --> 00:09:48,567
What just happened?

174
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:51,616
We were just backing up the car

175
00:09:51,616 --> 00:09:54,116
when this man fell from above!

176
00:09:54,116 --> 00:09:55,716
Isn't this...

177
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:57,216
Him?

178
00:09:57,216 --> 00:09:59,316
It is! It's Uesumi!

179
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:02,316
What's the matter?

180
00:10:02,316 --> 00:10:04,583
Hold on, who's that over there?

181
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,716
Someone suspicious was on the roof just now!

182
00:10:07,716 --> 00:10:08,587
What?

183
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,616
Do you remember what that person looked like?

184
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:15,616
I saw the clothes.

185
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,597
It might have been an acquaintance.

186
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:20,599
Ran, call the police

187
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:22,601
and keep watch over this place with the security guard!

188
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:25,116
-What? -I'm going with these people

189
00:10:25,116 --> 00:10:27,016
to the roof to take a look!

190
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:38,216
So this elevator has both front and rear doors?

191
00:10:38,216 --> 00:10:40,416
What are you doing, Mrs. Hirukawa?

192
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,516
Can't I just stay here?

193
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:45,216
I'm so scared.

194
00:10:45,216 --> 00:10:46,616
No way!

195
00:10:46,616 --> 00:10:49,316
You're the one who saw them, Mrs. Hirukawa!

196
00:11:00,816 --> 00:11:03,516
Shoes on top of a jacket.

197
00:11:03,516 --> 00:11:05,816
Then, suicide?

198
00:11:05,816 --> 00:11:09,216
Then, what was the person's shadow that Mrs. Hirukawa saw?

199
00:11:09,216 --> 00:11:12,651
The jacket flapping in the wind.

200
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:15,016
Maybe that's what I saw.

201
00:11:15,016 --> 00:11:17,216
It's all my fault.

202
00:11:17,216 --> 00:11:20,416
I pushed him too hard with my words.

203
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:23,116
No, this was most likely...

204
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,016
A murder.

205
00:11:25,016 --> 00:11:27,016
Isn't that right?

206
00:11:27,016 --> 00:11:28,216
Conan?

207
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:39,495
Murder, you say?

208
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:44,683
Are you saying you saw someone push him off from here?

209
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:45,995
No.

210
00:11:45,995 --> 00:11:50,195
I just happened to overhear your conversation stating that

211
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:53,595
the man who fell to his death was quite drunk.

212
00:11:53,595 --> 00:11:56,395
Due to my line of work, my ears are quite good.

213
00:11:56,395 --> 00:11:58,295
Your line of work?

214
00:11:58,295 --> 00:12:00,995
But, why isn't this a suicide?

215
00:12:00,995 --> 00:12:04,195
Look, his shoes are lined up properly.

216
00:12:04,195 --> 00:12:07,495
That's just a preconception, you know?

217
00:12:07,495 --> 00:12:11,995
I've seen innumerable jumper suicide scenes up until now, but...

218
00:12:11,995 --> 00:12:15,295
Just about none of the bodies had been shoeless.

219
00:12:15,295 --> 00:12:18,717
You've seen innumerable jumper suicide scenes?

220
00:12:18,895 --> 00:12:21,695
Well, I guess the most influential theory

221
00:12:21,695 --> 00:12:24,495
would be that it's a key plot device in movies or TV dramas?

222
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:27,695
"If you see shoes lined up on a roof, it's most likely suicide."

223
00:12:27,695 --> 00:12:29,395
It would be a convenience condition

224
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:32,731
for dramas to strike that chord emotionally.

225
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:34,295
Nowadays not so much, but...

226
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,095
The same goes for detective dramas in the past

227
00:12:36,095 --> 00:12:39,295
that would show blood gushing out of the mouths of people

228
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,739
who hung themselves.

229
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:42,741
In reality, blood will not flow out.

230
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:44,743
But it's easier for viewers to understand the death,

231
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:46,745
and it has more impact.

232
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:48,395
Although...

233
00:12:48,395 --> 00:12:50,749
Having seen those sorts of dramas or movies,

234
00:12:50,995 --> 00:12:52,751
there are cases you'd think the victims

235
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:56,755
should remove their shoes before jumping off, but...

236
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:58,495
Seeing how the man who fell to his death

237
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,195
had been heavily intoxicated

238
00:13:00,195 --> 00:13:03,695
and requested time to sober up.

239
00:13:03,695 --> 00:13:06,395
In such a groggy state, there's no way

240
00:13:06,395 --> 00:13:08,295
he'd do things such as take his jacket off

241
00:13:08,295 --> 00:13:10,769
and place his shoes neatly atop it.

242
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:12,395
And even the possibility

243
00:13:12,395 --> 00:13:16,295
that some random person placed this here as a prank...

244
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,195
Must be rejected since the shoes are directly above

245
00:13:18,195 --> 00:13:21,795
where the man fell to his death.

246
00:13:21,795 --> 00:13:23,795
So that brings us to...

247
00:13:23,795 --> 00:13:26,785
No other conclusion but that this was a disguise jumper suicide,

248
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:31,495
and the culprit deliberately lined the shoes up here, see?

249
00:13:31,495 --> 00:13:32,795
Right?

250
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:34,195
Little boy!

251
00:13:34,195 --> 00:13:37,395
Then, where is the culprit?

252
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:40,799
I bet he'll be arrested real soon now.

253
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:43,595
Since, before I came up here to the roof,

254
00:13:43,595 --> 00:13:47,695
I asked the guard to keep watch over the elevator and stairs.

255
00:13:47,695 --> 00:13:49,595
What's all this?

256
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:52,195
Who in the world are you?

257
00:13:52,195 --> 00:13:55,295
My name is Sera.

258
00:13:55,295 --> 00:13:57,695
Like this little boy here.

259
00:13:57,695 --> 00:13:59,595
I'm a detective.

260
00:14:01,795 --> 00:14:02,821
What?

261
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:04,823
There wasn't anyone there?

262
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:06,825
Are you saying there wasn't anyone at all

263
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:09,295
except this man who fell in the annex?

264
00:14:09,295 --> 00:14:11,095
No.

265
00:14:11,095 --> 00:14:14,833
According to the guard who had been watching the elevator and stairs,

266
00:14:14,995 --> 00:14:17,495
you all were the only ones who had passed.

267
00:14:17,495 --> 00:14:20,495
By the way, just who would you be?

268
00:14:20,495 --> 00:14:22,841
A detective, it seems.

269
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:24,495
A detective?

270
00:14:24,495 --> 00:14:27,795
Another one of these pain-in-the necks?

271
00:14:27,795 --> 00:14:31,295
But, why was this man there?

272
00:14:31,295 --> 00:14:34,495
The annex was under renovation, so nobody should've been there.

273
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,195
The deceased Teigo Uesumi

274
00:14:37,195 --> 00:14:40,595
was the son of the owner of this Haido Hotel.

275
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:43,795
They made an exception and let him use one of the rooms,

276
00:14:43,795 --> 00:14:46,395
in order to avoid the media, it seems.

277
00:14:46,395 --> 00:14:47,995
"Media"?

278
00:14:47,995 --> 00:14:49,895
Is that person famous?

279
00:14:49,895 --> 00:14:52,195
Yeah, sort of. He was arrested in the past

280
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:54,895
for being the ringleader of a remittance scam,

281
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,875
but was acquitted on insufficient proof

282
00:14:57,095 --> 00:14:59,595
and is now being written up about in the weeklies.

283
00:14:59,595 --> 00:15:02,295
But the media caught wind of it,

284
00:15:02,295 --> 00:15:05,395
and a huge uproar about it went on until last week.

285
00:15:05,395 --> 00:15:08,495
Mr. Uesumi flew off the handle at his media interviewers.

286
00:15:08,495 --> 00:15:11,895
And broke the sixth floor window with a fire extinguisher.

287
00:15:11,895 --> 00:15:14,495
Because of that, guests staying in the annex reduced,

288
00:15:14,495 --> 00:15:18,495
and even the hotel couldn't accommodate him anymore.

289
00:15:18,495 --> 00:15:19,995
There had been rumors that they were using

290
00:15:19,995 --> 00:15:22,695
the annex renovation as an excuse

291
00:15:22,695 --> 00:15:24,295
to force him to move overseas.

292
00:15:24,295 --> 00:15:27,595
Yes, we victims also heard that rumor,

293
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:29,495
and that's why we came to meet Uesumi.

294
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,895
Before he could flee overseas...

295
00:15:31,895 --> 00:15:34,595
We wanted him to at least give an apology.

296
00:15:34,595 --> 00:15:37,495
Then, were you able to see Mr. Uesumi?

297
00:15:37,495 --> 00:15:41,495
Yes, I was the first one to go to his room

298
00:15:41,495 --> 00:15:43,995
but he suddenly burst into tears

299
00:15:43,995 --> 00:15:46,095
and said that he'd admit to his crimes and apologize.

300
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:48,695
But said he wanted some time to sober up.

301
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:54,095
We thought we might as well record his repentance.

302
00:15:54,095 --> 00:15:55,395
So the three of us decided to go

303
00:15:55,395 --> 00:15:59,295
and buy a recording device from a nearby electronics shop.

304
00:15:59,295 --> 00:16:02,295
We got into my car in the parking lot,

305
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,943
but just as we backed up...

306
00:16:05,195 --> 00:16:08,595
He came falling right before our eyes!

307
00:16:11,195 --> 00:16:14,095
Just as you backed up the car?

308
00:16:14,095 --> 00:16:15,495
Inspector.

309
00:16:15,495 --> 00:16:17,895
It might be that someone tied a string or something

310
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:19,795
to connect Uesumi and the car

311
00:16:19,795 --> 00:16:22,961
and as a result that caused him to fall.

312
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:26,965
Was there anyone who touched your car or the body after he fell?

313
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:28,495
Don't know.

314
00:16:28,495 --> 00:16:30,095
I don't think anyone did!

315
00:16:30,095 --> 00:16:34,995
As soon as this lady said she saw a suspicious figure on the roof,

316
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:38,095
I immediately went up to the roof with her and the others!

317
00:16:38,095 --> 00:16:39,795
And in the meantime, I told Ran and the others

318
00:16:39,795 --> 00:16:44,095
to help the guards watch the car and the body.

319
00:16:44,095 --> 00:16:46,395
-Right? -Yeah.

320
00:16:46,395 --> 00:16:50,989
It seems the suspicious figure was something I mistook, though.

321
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:55,295
In that case, there may still be traces of some sort of contraption.

322
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,995
Inspect it thoroughly!

323
00:16:56,995 --> 00:16:59,795
-Roger! -But, this is strange.

324
00:16:59,795 --> 00:17:03,001
While I was waiting for the elevator,

325
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:08,395
I'm pretty sure it stopped on the sixth and second floors.

326
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,095
It stopped?

327
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,295
When did that happen?

328
00:17:12,295 --> 00:17:15,395
During the commotion of the man falling and all...

329
00:17:15,395 --> 00:17:16,595
Right after this little boy

330
00:17:16,595 --> 00:17:18,695
brought the lady and the others to the elevator

331
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:21,019
and headed to the roof.

332
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:25,023
The elevator went nonstop to the top floor

333
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:27,025
but took its time coming back down.

334
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:30,795
But, if I recall, there should have been two elevators.

335
00:17:30,795 --> 00:17:33,695
It appears that only one had been working.

336
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,035
Since they figured Uesumi was the only one staying there.

337
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:41,039
Then, it may be that someone else is still lurking in the annex.

338
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,595
Yeah.

339
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:45,043
The investigators are searching every nook and cranny,

340
00:17:45,295 --> 00:17:48,095
but there are no results of anyone having been found yet.

341
00:17:48,095 --> 00:17:49,995
The surveillance cameras?

342
00:17:49,995 --> 00:17:52,295
They're in the elevators and the hallways, right?

343
00:17:52,295 --> 00:17:54,295
About that...

344
00:17:54,295 --> 00:17:56,495
when Mr. Uesumi wreaked havoc,

345
00:17:56,495 --> 00:17:59,057
he sprayed paint all over the hotel annex.

346
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:03,795
And even the surveillance cameras were all sprayed over.

347
00:18:03,795 --> 00:18:07,065
They're all blacked out and nothing can be seen.

348
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:11,069
In short, the inside of the annex is a black box.

349
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:15,073
No one can tell for sure who did what inside of it.

350
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:18,295
This is getting to be exciting, right, sonny?

351
00:18:18,295 --> 00:18:20,495
Please watch what you say!

352
00:18:20,495 --> 00:18:23,081
A person just passed away, you know!

353
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:25,083
Oh, yes. Sorry.

354
00:18:25,295 --> 00:18:27,085
Anyway...

355
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:29,395
It seems it's necessary for us to check it out.

356
00:18:29,395 --> 00:18:31,595
The reason the elevator supposedly stopped

357
00:18:31,595 --> 00:18:33,091
on the second and sixth floors.

358
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:35,093
I'm telling you it did!

359
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:38,495
But even if you tell that to the police detectives...

360
00:18:38,495 --> 00:18:40,895
Let's just tell them anyway!

361
00:18:40,895 --> 00:18:42,395
What is it?

362
00:18:43,295 --> 00:18:47,095
Well, you see, it's just a rumor, but...

363
00:18:47,095 --> 00:18:49,995
They say it appears in this annex.

364
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:52,795
Appears? What does?

365
00:18:52,795 --> 00:18:55,113
A ghost, it's a ghost!

366
00:18:55,295 --> 00:18:57,115
At night, some people seem to have seen

367
00:18:57,115 --> 00:19:00,595
an unoccupied wheelchair that belonged to an elderly man

368
00:19:00,595 --> 00:19:03,121
wandering around the annex!

369
00:19:04,595 --> 00:19:06,895
It could be that ghost was the one

370
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,395
who pushed the elevator button.

371
00:19:09,395 --> 00:19:11,129
Now see here.

372
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:13,695
If no one was sitting in the wheelchair,

373
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:17,135
how could you tell, it was an elderly man's ghost?

374
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:19,595
It was my father.

375
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:22,695
The one who fell victim to the remittance scam

376
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:25,143
was my mother.

377
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:27,145
But she collapsed due to the shock

378
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:28,895
and had to be hospitalized, so...

379
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,695
my father deliberately booked a room in the annex

380
00:19:31,695 --> 00:19:35,995
so that he could plead to Uesumi in front of his room every day.

381
00:19:35,995 --> 00:19:38,095
Saying, "I won't ask you to return the money,"

382
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:41,159
"but please apologize to my wife"

383
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:45,163
But when my father found out about my mother's death in the hospital,

384
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:47,695
on the evening of that day...

385
00:19:47,695 --> 00:19:51,195
He committed suicide in the room he was staying.

386
00:19:51,195 --> 00:19:54,195
My father had been using an electric wheelchair

387
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:57,895
on loan from the hotel due to his disabilities.

388
00:19:57,895 --> 00:20:00,695
I guess that's how the rumor started.

389
00:20:01,495 --> 00:20:05,495
Incidentally, what room did your father stay in?

390
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,695
It was on the second floor.

391
00:20:15,195 --> 00:20:17,695
The graffiti certainly is terrible.

392
00:20:17,695 --> 00:20:20,695
No choice but to renovate, huh?

393
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:22,795
Officer Chiba!

394
00:20:22,795 --> 00:20:24,695
You found anyone?

395
00:20:24,695 --> 00:20:26,195
Not yet.

396
00:20:26,195 --> 00:20:29,207
Oh? Why is the wheelchair here?

397
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,209
I don't know.

398
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:33,995
When I found it, it was still moving.

399
00:20:33,995 --> 00:20:35,495
It was moving?

400
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:37,895
Since there was a weird fishing line

401
00:20:37,895 --> 00:20:40,195
attached between the wheels,

402
00:20:40,195 --> 00:20:41,995
I checked with the hotel.

403
00:20:41,995 --> 00:20:43,595
They said this was the electric wheelchair

404
00:20:43,595 --> 00:20:46,995
that the fallen Uesumi had been borrowing.

405
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,495
So did he have bad legs?

406
00:20:49,495 --> 00:20:54,595
No, it seems he was just using it to cruise around the annex.

407
00:20:54,595 --> 00:20:57,895
What an unbelievable guy.

408
00:20:57,895 --> 00:21:00,395
It's possible that Uesumi was the one

409
00:21:00,395 --> 00:21:03,241
behind the aforementioned ghost commotion.

410
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:06,295
If he had planned to scare the three victims

411
00:21:06,295 --> 00:21:09,247
who came to visit on 2F where the elderly man committed suicide,

412
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,695
By manipulating the unoccupied wheelchair with a fishing line...

413
00:21:11,695 --> 00:21:14,395
if we think of it this way...

414
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:18,395
That would certainly make sense.

415
00:21:18,395 --> 00:21:22,195
Even so, this fishing line is extremely long.

416
00:21:22,195 --> 00:21:26,195
And there are some broken rubber bands at the tip of this.

417
00:21:26,195 --> 00:21:27,795
The footrests have marks

418
00:21:27,795 --> 00:21:31,269
indicating they've bumped into something.

419
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:32,995
The man who fell to his death

420
00:21:32,995 --> 00:21:35,273
was the ringleader of a remittance fraud group

421
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:38,695
that had caused a public uproar Teigo Uesumi.

422
00:21:38,695 --> 00:21:41,795
Mrs. Hirukawa and other victims from his scam

423
00:21:41,795 --> 00:21:43,895
visited this Haido Hotel.

424
00:21:43,895 --> 00:21:45,695
While waiting for Uesumi,

425
00:21:45,695 --> 00:21:48,195
who had wept and admitted to his crimes, to sober up,

426
00:21:48,195 --> 00:21:50,795
they decided to go buy a recording device for his confession,

427
00:21:50,795 --> 00:21:53,095
and just as they started driving,

428
00:21:53,095 --> 00:21:55,895
Uesumi came tumbling down.

429
00:21:55,895 --> 00:21:57,695
On the roof, we found Uesumi's

430
00:21:57,695 --> 00:22:00,395
clothes and shoes lined up perfectly, but...

431
00:22:00,395 --> 00:22:04,295
It was actually a setup to disguise this as a suicide.

432
00:22:04,295 --> 00:22:07,305
According to the testimony of this self-proclaimed detective,

433
00:22:07,495 --> 00:22:09,795
after we had rushed up to the roof,

434
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,095
he saw the elevator stopping at the sixth and second floors

435
00:22:12,095 --> 00:22:14,495
before coming down to first floor.

436
00:22:14,495 --> 00:22:18,895
And a wheelchair still in motion was found on the second floor.

437
00:22:18,895 --> 00:22:21,095
A long line had been tied between the wheels

438
00:22:21,095 --> 00:22:24,795
with broken rubber bands attached at the tip.

439
00:22:24,795 --> 00:22:27,795
Doesn't this mean that the culprit utilized this wheelchair

440
00:22:27,795 --> 00:22:30,995
to make Uesumi fall to his death?

441
00:22:30,995 --> 00:22:33,331
But, how did he do it?

442
00:22:34,295 --> 00:22:39,337
Moreover, just who is this guy calling himself "Sera"?

443
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,814
Next Conan's Hint:

444
00:24:03,814 --> 00:24:05,784
"Paint Cans"

445
00:24:05,784 --> 00:24:08,056
-He's such a handsome chum! -I wonder.

446
00:24:08,056 --> 00:24:09,100
Why, are you jealous?

447
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,760
You'll find out in the next episode.
