1
00:00:02,514 --> 00:00:03,983
After accepting Sonoko's invitation,

2
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:07,987
Ran and I headed toward Haido Hotel for a cake buffet.

3
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:11,991
We encountered a Jeet Kune Do user on the bus en route.

4
00:00:12,214 --> 00:00:13,993
With combative skills that evenly matched Ran's,

5
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:15,995
who is this person?

6
00:00:16,214 --> 00:00:18,514
At Haido Hotel, the fact that the cake buffet offer

7
00:00:18,514 --> 00:00:23,414
already came to an end disappointed Ran and Sonoko.

8
00:00:23,414 --> 00:00:26,005
Then came a resounding scream.

9
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:28,007
A man had fallen to his death

10
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:31,214
at the parking lot behind the hotel annex.

11
00:00:31,214 --> 00:00:34,013
Toshiko Hirukawa, a housewife who happened to be there,

12
00:00:34,214 --> 00:00:36,414
said she saw someone on the roof,

13
00:00:36,414 --> 00:00:39,014
so we rushed there as fast as we could.

14
00:00:39,014 --> 00:00:41,314
However, all we saw on the roof

15
00:00:41,314 --> 00:00:44,514
were men's shoes and clothes.

16
00:00:44,514 --> 00:00:46,614
Was this a suicide?

17
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:51,214
No, this was a murder disguised as a suicide.

18
00:00:51,214 --> 00:00:54,033
One more person saw through the disguise.

19
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:56,614
It was the Jeet Kune Do user from earlier, Sera.

20
00:00:56,614 --> 00:00:59,114
That wannabe claimed to be a detective.

21
00:01:00,714 --> 00:01:03,314
The man who fell to his death was Teigo Uesumi.

22
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:04,814
He caused a public uproar

23
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,714
for being the ringleader of a remittance scam.

24
00:01:06,714 --> 00:01:10,714
And Hirukawa's group was victims from that scam.

25
00:01:12,414 --> 00:01:14,614
In the hotel annex where Uesumi was hiding,

26
00:01:14,614 --> 00:01:16,614
rumors regarding an old man's ghost on a wheelchair

27
00:01:16,614 --> 00:01:18,057
were flying about.

28
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:22,061
Apparently, Hirukwa's father who had been using the wheelchair

29
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:23,114
lost hope at the news of his wife's death

30
00:01:23,114 --> 00:01:24,614
due to her suffering from the scam.

31
00:01:24,614 --> 00:01:28,414
And committed suicide in this hotel annex.

32
00:01:28,414 --> 00:01:33,214
Don't tell me, Uesumi was pushed off by a ghost?

33
00:01:33,214 --> 00:01:34,914
Or was it...

34
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,814
If all cases were men,

35
00:01:55,814 --> 00:01:57,614
all hidden mysteries are women.

36
00:01:57,614 --> 00:01:59,614
The truth behind the ghost will betray any expectations.

37
00:01:59,614 --> 00:02:01,614
And the identity of Sera, our new detective is...

38
00:02:01,614 --> 00:02:03,114
He sees through the one and only truth.

39
00:02:03,114 --> 00:02:04,914
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

40
00:02:04,914 --> 00:02:07,614
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

41
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:37,041
"Deduction Showdown at the Haunted Hotel (Part 2)"

42
00:03:41,241 --> 00:03:43,941
This graffiti certainly is terrible.

43
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:47,341
No choice but to renovate, huh?

44
00:03:47,341 --> 00:03:48,741
Officer Chiba!

45
00:03:48,741 --> 00:03:50,541
You found anyone?

46
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,211
No, not yet.

47
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:55,341
Oh? Why is there a wheelchair here?

48
00:03:55,341 --> 00:03:57,241
I don't know.

49
00:03:57,241 --> 00:03:59,841
When I found it, it was still moving.

50
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:01,541
It was moving?

51
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,741
Since there was weird fishing line

52
00:04:03,741 --> 00:04:06,225
attached between the wheels,

53
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:07,941
I checked with the hotel.

54
00:04:07,941 --> 00:04:10,229
They said this was the electric wheelchair

55
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:12,841
that the fallen Uesumi had been borrowing.

56
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:15,341
So did he have bad legs?

57
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:20,641
No, it seems that he was just using it to cruise around the annex.

58
00:04:20,641 --> 00:04:23,841
What an unbelievable guy.

59
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:26,245
It's possible that Uesumi was the one

60
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:29,041
behind the aforementioned ghost commotion.

61
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:32,251
If he had planned to scare the three victims

62
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:35,141
who came to visit on 2F where the elderly man committed suicide,

63
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,541
by manipulating the unoccupied wheelchair with a fishing line,

64
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,259
if we think of it this way...

65
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:44,263
That would certainly make sense.

66
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:48,041
Even so, this fishing line is extremely long.

67
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:52,041
And there are some broken rubber bands at the tip of this.

68
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,641
The footrests have marks

69
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:56,541
indicating they've bumped into something.

70
00:04:56,541 --> 00:05:00,741
Say, Inspector, couldn't the culprit have used this?

71
00:05:00,741 --> 00:05:03,241
Take a look out the window.

72
00:05:03,241 --> 00:05:07,441
This is the opposite side from the parking lot where Uesumi fell.

73
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:10,741
They couldn't have accomplished anything even with the wheelchair.

74
00:05:10,741 --> 00:05:12,841
Why is Conan with us?

75
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:16,295
Conan was among the ones who came to the annex

76
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:20,299
after the incident, so I brought him along just in case.

77
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:22,941
Looks like there's an unfamiliar man in the mix.

78
00:05:22,941 --> 00:05:25,341
Yeah, a detective it seems.

79
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:29,541
A detective, huh?

80
00:05:31,141 --> 00:05:34,313
Could it have been your misunderstanding?

81
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:37,641
Regarding this elevator stopping on the second and sixth floor?

82
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:41,641
If you think I'm lying, ask the guard and find out.

83
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,541
Because we both saw it

84
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,641
when I asked him to keep watch on the elevator.

85
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:55,041
So the doors on this side open too?

86
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:59,141
Yeah! This elevator has both front and rear doors!

87
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:01,041
When I asked the hotel staff,

88
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,741
they said that this side of the annex's 1F and 2F

89
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:06,345
were made into a Grand Hall used for occasions like weddings.

90
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,041
And that by making the elevator entrance and exit

91
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,841
on the opposite side, it was more convenient

92
00:06:09,841 --> 00:06:14,641
and freed up more space, so that's why!

93
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:18,841
Still, it seems that the graffiti here is even more obnoxious.

94
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:20,141
Yes.

95
00:06:20,141 --> 00:06:24,041
Since this apparently was the floor Uesumi had been staying on.

96
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,365
By the way, the renovation workers

97
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:28,367
had been scheduled to come in one hour

98
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,641
after the time of Uesumi's fall.

99
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,041
So this is it...

100
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:35,041
The window Uesumi broke using the fire extinguisher.

101
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,375
Looks like it.

102
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,041
Hey, that's dangerous!

103
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,941
The sticky tape on the sheets that had been covering it

104
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:43,941
has been blown through by the wind.

105
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:45,941
But, this place is...

106
00:06:45,941 --> 00:06:49,041
it's directly above the place where he fell, right?

107
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,241
Don't you think this means something?

108
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:57,441
On the border between the wall under the window and the floor,

109
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:59,341
there's a lot of paint.

110
00:07:00,641 --> 00:07:02,141
What's more...

111
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:06,041
It's entirely dried up.

112
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,141
And these marks seem to indicate

113
00:07:07,141 --> 00:07:09,841
something had been placed a top the paint.

114
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,415
This paint can, perhaps?

115
00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:19,941
There's a dent on it caused by collision.

116
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:23,441
And there's one more paint can with the same condition.

117
00:07:23,441 --> 00:07:26,041
As far as having marks from having bumped into something,

118
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:30,441
the bottom parts of those elevator doors have them too.

119
00:07:31,241 --> 00:07:33,941
Hold on, hold on.

120
00:07:33,941 --> 00:07:37,341
An elevator with both front and rear doors.

121
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:40,439
An electric wheelchair with fishing line attached.

122
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:42,441
Rumors of ghosts.

123
00:07:42,941 --> 00:07:47,141
And this suspicious renovation scene.

124
00:07:47,141 --> 00:07:49,841
I see, so that's how it was!

125
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:51,541
No doubt the culprit was the only one

126
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,141
to have entered the annex before the incident.

127
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:56,741
It was that lady named Hirukawa, our culprit!

128
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:58,441
What?

129
00:07:58,441 --> 00:08:01,841
If you would set things up per my instructions now,

130
00:08:01,841 --> 00:08:04,463
and bring Mrs. Hirukawa over here?

131
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,475
You said the case is solved.

132
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:20,041
So then you've realized that he committed suicide after all?

133
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,741
No.

134
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:26,041
Teigo Uesumi's jumper suicide was a trick.

135
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,941
And that's why we deliberately had you come to this 6F

136
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,489
via the elevator

137
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:32,941
which was out of service at the time of crime.

138
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:35,141
Because the culprit used the elevator

139
00:08:35,141 --> 00:08:37,241
in order to disguise it as a suicide.

140
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:38,497
Or so he says.

141
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:40,499
He? I'm...

142
00:08:40,741 --> 00:08:42,241
You're Sera, right?

143
00:08:42,241 --> 00:08:44,841
-Oh, I mean... -Anyway...

144
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:46,505
Can you tell us?

145
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:48,507
Your deduction, Sera?

146
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:50,509
We'll listen and let you know

147
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:53,341
if there are any erroneous parts.

148
00:08:53,341 --> 00:08:56,515
Well, all right, you d better watch and learn.

149
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:58,241
Because the trick I'm going to speak of

150
00:08:58,241 --> 00:09:00,541
will be put it into practice right here!

151
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,141
But, why right here?

152
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:08,841
Even if it was a murder, didn't he fall from the roof?

153
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:10,529
I've said this before,

154
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:14,041
but Uesumi's jacket and shoes found on the roof

155
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,241
were placed beforehand in order to make this incident

156
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:18,841
look like a jumper suicide.

157
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:20,539
They were fakes planted there

158
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:22,041
so that we wouldn't know the actual crime scene was here

159
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,543
on the 6F of the annex.

160
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:26,141
Mrs. Hirakawa.

161
00:09:26,141 --> 00:09:29,441
You did that in order to hide the fact that you used

162
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:33,941
the elevator and wheelchair to fling Uesumi out from here!

163
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,441
Hold on a minute!

164
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:39,741
When he fell from above,

165
00:09:39,741 --> 00:09:43,141
Mrs. Hirukawa was inside the car in the parking lot

166
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:45,841
with the two of us!

167
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:47,241
That's right.

168
00:09:47,241 --> 00:09:49,041
So tell me,

169
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:52,571
how could I have controlled the wheelchair and the elevator?

170
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:53,841
Sure thing!

171
00:09:53,841 --> 00:09:55,941
Once you pressed the buttons on the elevator beforehand,

172
00:09:55,941 --> 00:09:57,641
you didn't need to stay there

173
00:09:57,641 --> 00:10:01,341
to be able to transport Uesumi in the electric wheelchair

174
00:10:01,341 --> 00:10:03,941
from 2F to 6F, drop him,

175
00:10:03,941 --> 00:10:08,041
and then return the wheelchair to 2F.

176
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,141
Although, you did need to have prepared

177
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:14,593
a long fishing line with several rubber bands attached to one end.

178
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:16,341
Fishing line and rubber bands?

179
00:10:16,341 --> 00:10:20,241
Well, why don't we hear it from you then?

180
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:23,741
How one could automatically cause someone to fall to their death

181
00:10:23,741 --> 00:10:26,605
with this witchcraft-like trick?

182
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:27,841
Well...

183
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:42,621
First, you met with Uesumi who was staying on this sixth floor

184
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:45,741
and fed him alcohol until he was inebriated.

185
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:49,241
Next, you set the completely smashed Uesumi up

186
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:51,641
in the wheelchair he borrowed,

187
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:54,141
in a way that he was hugging his knees,

188
00:10:54,141 --> 00:10:56,141
and brought him in front of the elevator

189
00:10:56,141 --> 00:10:57,741
while opening the door.

190
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,641
So that you could wrap the rubber bands

191
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:02,641
attached to the long fishing line around the mirror

192
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:05,141
near the elevator's ceiling.

193
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:07,341
Then, you pushed the button for the first floor

194
00:11:07,341 --> 00:11:11,441
from outside the elevator to send the empty cab down,

195
00:11:11,441 --> 00:11:12,651
so that you could measure

196
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:14,653
the length of the line between 1F and 6F.

197
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:17,241
You then brought the elevator back up to 6F

198
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:20,941
and at a length about 30cm shorter than measured.

199
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:22,661
You tied the fishing line

200
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:24,141
in between the front wheels of the chair,

201
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,641
so that your trick could start!

202
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:29,241
After reeling the fishing line in

203
00:11:29,241 --> 00:11:31,041
so that it wouldn't catch on anything,

204
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,673
you rode the elevator with Uesumi on the wheelchair.

205
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:38,677
On the second floor, you pushed the wheelchair out the elevator

206
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:41,841
and steered the wheelchair toward the elevator doors.

207
00:11:41,841 --> 00:11:45,341
You then closed the doors and descended to 1F.

208
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,941
The one who ran into Mrs. Hirukawa

209
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:53,741
as she got off on 1F was this little boy.

210
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:55,341
It seems you told him,

211
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:57,941
"This one is for the annex, so don't get on" or something.

212
00:11:57,941 --> 00:12:02,341
But that was to prevent the little boy from using the elevator.

213
00:12:02,341 --> 00:12:04,703
Because if he did, the fact that

214
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:06,341
a weird line was dangling down from the mirror

215
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:08,707
above the elevator doors.

216
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:09,941
And that the other end of the line

217
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:13,441
passed out through the opposite doors would be exposed.

218
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:18,241
Plus, the fact that the buttons for 2F and 6F had been pushed

219
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:21,141
would have become an obvious clue.

220
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,941
The second and sixth floors?

221
00:12:23,941 --> 00:12:26,725
Well, "Seeing is believing".

222
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:28,341
Let's go ahead and reenact it!

223
00:12:28,341 --> 00:12:29,841
Ready, Inspector?

224
00:12:30,741 --> 00:12:32,731
Officer Chiba, are you ready?

225
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:33,741
Yes, sir!

226
00:12:33,741 --> 00:12:37,041
I've pressed the buttons for 2F and 6F on the elevator.

227
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,737
I'm sending it up now!

228
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:44,743
As the elevator reaches the second floor,

229
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:46,541
what's waiting for it is...

230
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:49,841
The electric wheelchair, which is still moving forward

231
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:51,741
while being blocked by the doors.

232
00:12:51,741 --> 00:12:54,541
When those doors open, it'll go inside the elevator

233
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,941
and keep going straight into the doors on the opposite side.

234
00:12:57,941 --> 00:12:59,441
As you already know,

235
00:12:59,441 --> 00:13:03,141
this elevator has both front and rear doors.

236
00:13:03,141 --> 00:13:05,441
The doors that open on 2F

237
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:08,767
are on the opposite side as those that open on 6F.

238
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:12,241
Which means the wheelchair that entered on the 2F

239
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:15,841
will automatically come straight out when it reaches this 6F.

240
00:13:18,141 --> 00:13:20,779
Afterwards, if you use the paint cans and cardboard boxes

241
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:25,641
placed around the elevator to guide the wheelchair's path...

242
00:13:25,641 --> 00:13:27,541
The wheelchair will keep going in a straight line

243
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,787
parallel to the wall.

244
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,541
Toward the glass window that Uesumi had broken,

245
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,941
hit the wall below it, and...

246
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:40,441
What?

247
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:42,801
Hey, what's the meaning of this?

248
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:44,041
No, no way!

249
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,441
The reactive force from hitting the wall

250
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:48,141
should have already sent the dummy flying out!

251
00:13:48,141 --> 00:13:51,641
Perhaps, when the wheelchair headed back to the second floor,

252
00:13:51,641 --> 00:13:52,811
the force of the turn threw him out...

253
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:56,041
But, according to your previous deduction,

254
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:59,241
you said the culprit only returned the wheelchair to the second floor

255
00:13:59,241 --> 00:14:01,341
after Uesumi had fallen.

256
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,141
Did I say that?

257
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:06,825
Don't tell me this wannabe truly didn't figure it out?

258
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,827
But I'm in a bind.

259
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:10,541
It's too abrupt to call Sonoko now

260
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,831
and put her to sleep for my deduction.

261
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:14,833
And making Inspector Megure or Detective Takagi

262
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,641
the target of my tranquilizer watch

263
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:20,839
will create problems down the road.

264
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:22,341
The only one who can appear here unannounced

265
00:14:22,341 --> 00:14:25,141
and yet convincingly shine light on the truth...

266
00:14:25,141 --> 00:14:27,441
And later be able to explain away their involvement,

267
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:29,541
is none other than...

268
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,141
I got it!

269
00:14:31,141 --> 00:14:32,851
She used her car!

270
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:35,241
She tied Uesumi, who was brought here by the wheelchair,

271
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,441
to her car with a fishing line and backed it up...

272
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:39,441
Sorry to say,

273
00:14:39,441 --> 00:14:41,941
but we didn't find any sort of device or trick at all

274
00:14:41,941 --> 00:14:43,541
on Mrs. Hirukawa's car.

275
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:47,641
And frankly, if she had tied Uesumi to her car using the line,

276
00:14:47,641 --> 00:14:49,741
she could've just left him sleeping near the window

277
00:14:49,741 --> 00:14:52,871
instead of moving him with the wheelchair, no?

278
00:14:53,841 --> 00:14:55,841
You have a point.

279
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:58,141
Look what I've done.

280
00:14:58,141 --> 00:15:00,241
I was too careless.

281
00:15:01,741 --> 00:15:05,341
Indeed, an interesting trick it was.

282
00:15:05,341 --> 00:15:07,941
But it was just an empty theory.

283
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:11,441
I'm disappointed in you, police officers.

284
00:15:11,441 --> 00:15:14,893
To think you'd take a whipper-snapper's fantasy as truth.

285
00:15:15,841 --> 00:15:17,841
It was the paint cans.

286
00:15:19,341 --> 00:15:23,541
The culprit used the two paint cans near the window

287
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,641
in order to toss the victim out the window.

288
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:29,241
-The... -The voice... is that Kudo?

289
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:30,909
That's right!

290
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:35,341
Once I told Shinichi about the case over the phone,

291
00:15:35,341 --> 00:15:37,541
he said he figured it out!

292
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:40,141
Shinichi Kudo?

293
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,927
Shinichi Kudo?

294
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:50,710
And then?

295
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,931
How exactly were the paint cans used?

296
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,410
Kudo?

297
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,210
There is a huge stain

298
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,939
from spilled paint beneath the window, right?

299
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:03,710
And some marks indicating something had been put there.

300
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,310
So please set the paint cans on their side

301
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,610
and align them with those marks.

302
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,951
Do they match up perfectly?

303
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:15,810
Both of them match up exactly!

304
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,410
Then please hold those two cans in place

305
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,110
from either side with your feet.

306
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,110
Pull the wheelchair away from the window

307
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,710
and set it in motion once more!

308
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,310
Well, the wheelchair...

309
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,610
All right, I'll handle this.

310
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,510
Will it work if I start from around here, Kudo?

311
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,975
Around here?

312
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,977
I'm not at the crime scene,

313
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:40,610
so there's no way I could ascertain that.

314
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,981
I suppose so, huh.

315
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:45,710
All right, I'll let 'er rip!

316
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,987
The wheelchair Uesumi had been placed

317
00:16:48,987 --> 00:16:50,989
in exited the elevator on 6F

318
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:53,010
and headed toward the window.

319
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,310
And when the footrests hit the paint cans

320
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,710
that had been glued against the wall by paint.

321
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,510
The footrests would slip under the cans

322
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,610
tilting the wheelchair forward.

323
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,810
The armrests would then hit the wall,

324
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:15,610
sending the victim flying due to recoil.

325
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:19,410
And the culprit having confirmed the victim's fall with her own eyes.

326
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,710
Made up an excuse to go up the roof

327
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,210
by mentioning a suspicious figure

328
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,710
and brought the elevator down from the sixth floor

329
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,710
to the first floor.

330
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:32,510
Chiba, call the elevator down to 1F.

331
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,810
Roger that.

332
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,410
Doing so pulled on the fishing line

333
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,810
that had been attached to the wheels.

334
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,310
The wheelchair did an about-face

335
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:51,049
and moved toward the elevator

336
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:53,410
and crashed into the elevator doors!

337
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,310
As the fishing line that was 30cm shy

338
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,055
kept being pulled down...

339
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:59,057
The rubber bands wrapped around the elevator mirror

340
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:01,059
stretched to the fullest.

341
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:02,310
And snapped!

342
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,410
That's how, when the culprit got on to the elevator,

343
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:11,069
nothing was left inside of it!

344
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:14,310
Afterwards, when the elevator reached the rooftop,

345
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,075
she made up some reason.

346
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:19,610
What are you doing, Mrs. Hirukawa?

347
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,210
Can't I just stay here?

348
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,710
I'm scared.

349
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,083
No way!

350
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:29,610
You're the one who saw them, Mrs. Hirukawa!

351
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,610
And she only had to push the 6F and 2F buttons before she left.

352
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,410
Having done so, the elevator would bring the wheelchair

353
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:43,810
from 6F down to 2F in the same manner as before.

354
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,210
Even if the police found it later...

355
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,410
They would only see it as a random wheelchair

356
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,810
that was still running for some reason,

357
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,710
away from the crime scene.

358
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:56,610
Incidentally, the reason why the paint cans were not stuck to the wall

359
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,610
under the window when Conan got there was...

360
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,510
because the collision from the footrests

361
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,410
knocked them loose from the wall.

362
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,310
And when the wheelchair turned around,

363
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:09,127
the force bumped them off.

364
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:11,910
At any rate, if you find fibers from the clothes the victim was wearing

365
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,610
on the clothes the culprit has on,

366
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,610
it'd be decisive.

367
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:20,110
Since, in order for a woman to put a grown man in a wheelchair

368
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:24,510
she had to have held his body tightly against her.

369
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,810
Of course, if you testify that the man

370
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:29,410
whom you saw as the remittance scam ringleader...

371
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,110
And you, the surviving family member of his victim,

372
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,153
had hugged in joy after reconciling...

373
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:37,510
That'll be a different story.

374
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:42,110
If I had to commit that sort of nausea-inducing perjury,

375
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,310
I'd rather just confess to everything!

376
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:47,810
That I was the one who put that man in the wheelchair,

377
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:51,810
And wheeled him straight into hell!

378
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:55,173
Then, could it be that the haunting rumors

379
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:58,510
were the result of your having tested this trick out repeatedly?

380
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,010
No.

381
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,181
I only came up with the idea of setting the paint cans

382
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:06,510
under the window that man broke.

383
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,910
The one who tested it out repeatedly wasn't me.

384
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:14,510
Before, when I had gone to that man's room to call on him...

385
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,195
It was that man who showed me...

386
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,310
An unoccupied wheelchair

387
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:24,310
coming out from an empty elevator.

388
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:28,810
Don't tell me, the victim came up with the trick himself?

389
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,610
Yeah. That man, as he was laughing

390
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,810
and ending the call with his friend who had sent the elevator up, said...

391
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,217
It was a plan to drive out all the pesky media

392
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,219
and hotel annex guests,

393
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:44,610
dubbed "Operation Old Geezer's Ghost"!

394
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,510
That's why I had him sit in the wheelchair

395
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:52,110
in order to make that man understand

396
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:55,233
how my father had kept begging for his apologies

397
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:57,510
even while riding in a wheelchair.

398
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,510
That heartrending feeling of his...

399
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:11,910
Afterwards, Teigo Uesumi's hidden bank account was found,

400
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,610
and by following the money trial, more scan groups

401
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,710
were subsequently arrested.

402
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,710
The case against the remittance scan leader

403
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,010
was sent to the prosecutor even though the suspect had died.

404
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,810
And thus the curtain closed on

405
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,610
both the scam case and the murder case.

406
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:52,910
Huh? It was Shinichi who solved that case?

407
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,210
That's right!

408
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:57,355
Detective Takagi spilled the beans after my interrogation!

409
00:22:57,355 --> 00:23:00,510
How he had seen through the truth like it was nothing

410
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,361
after getting a call from Conan!

411
00:23:03,361 --> 00:23:05,910
Wouldn't it be great if he would also take the time

412
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,210
to give his lovely dear wife a ring?

413
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,110
That reminds me,

414
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:14,410
that Sera person was also a detective, according to Conan.

415
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,377
That person also said "We'll see each other soon" before we left.

416
00:23:19,377 --> 00:23:21,379
I wonder what that meant?

417
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:25,010
I don't know. Maybe he's just interested in you. Ran?

418
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:29,810
All right.

419
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:32,910
Let me introduce to you!

420
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:36,310
Someone who's joining our class as of today.

421
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,810
Sera!

422
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,110
Sera?

423
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,403
A transfer student?

424
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,810
What the... she's wearing a skirt!

425
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,110
A girl?

426
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,710
My name is Masumi Sera.

427
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,010
Nice to meet you!

428
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

429
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,966
"Signed Books"

430
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:07,425
Next time, I'm taking the leading role, too.

431
00:24:07,622 --> 00:24:09,226
Please root for me, a high school girl, Masami Sera.

432
00:24:09,226 --> 00:24:10,840
-No, the leading role is... -Mine, you know...
