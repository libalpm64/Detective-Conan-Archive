1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,540
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,340
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,040
At last, the two of us are out on a date.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,940
But an additional dish of trouble is added to our meal.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,540
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,290
While exploring a limestone cave,

9
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,090
I was shot by a gang of bank robbers.

10
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,290
Ran's blood is used for my transfusion and it saved my life.

11
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,290
This makes me decide to tell Ran about everything.

12
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,490
But then Haibara points a gun at me.

13
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,690
And then, on the day of Teitan High School's school festival,

14
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,790
while the play was going on in the gymnasium,

15
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,090
a murder takes place in the audience!

16
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,790
And from beneath the black knight's mask...

17
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,690
The crime was also bold and brazen.

18
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,990
Who are you?

19
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,690
It's been a long time, Inspector Megure.

20
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,690
It's me, Shinichi Kudo.

21
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:46,290
"Perilous Return: Shinichi Is Back"

22
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,790
Yes.

23
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,990
Yes?

24
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,390
Take your finger off that buzzer!

25
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,990
I heard you the first time!

26
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,790
Shinichi.

27
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,490
Do you really know today's schedule at school?

28
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,190
No problem, it's the same as last year.

29
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,390
All we're going to do is clean up

30
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,990
after the school fest anyway, right?

31
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,090
I'll go get ready, wait here.

32
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,290
There he is! It's Shinichi!

33
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,190
I wasn't dreaming.

34
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,190
He really came back.

35
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,890
Isn't that wonderful, Conan?

36
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,190
Huh?

37
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,190
Yes, this is much better!

38
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,390
This is my real body.

39
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,490
Don't get too comfortable, though.

40
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,990
Haibara!

41
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,190
Who do you think you are anyway?

42
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,990
The only reason she hasn't found out about you

43
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,690
is because of the special antidote I made

44
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,190
and the capsule and mask voice changer Doctor Agasa made

45
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,090
so that I could disguise myself as you.

46
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,690
You promised that all you would do was talk to her secretly on the stage for a few minutes.

47
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:03,590
So why'd you show your face so dramatically?

48
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,890
Sorry!

49
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,590
But when I solved the case,

50
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,890
I just couldn't control myself.

51
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,790
Besides, I never thought the antidote you gave me

52
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,790
would completely restore me back to my old self.

53
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,090
Do you think I made a mistake?

54
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:22,090
You should thank that friend of yours from Osaka.

55
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,190
When you collapsed

56
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,290
and after I told him what was going on,

57
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,890
he told everyone not to talk about the case.

58
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,390
I don't know how well he convinced everyone though.

59
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,590
I guess I'll have to keep up this act and stay at Ran's place

60
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,990
until things cool down for your sake.

61
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,690
Hey, Haibara.

62
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:46,190
Why are you doing all this for me?

63
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,990
You made the antidote,

64
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,690
don't you want to take it and go back to your old life?

65
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,290
You fool.

66
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,190
I'm only helping you because if your cover is blown,

67
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,890
I'm going to get caught in the crossfire.

68
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,790
Besides, the antidote you took was a test product.

69
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,490
I don't intend to take it

70
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,390
until I've observed how it affects you.

71
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,790
By the way, Haibara...

72
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,290
What is it now?

73
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,990
Could you stop talking like a girl when you use Conan's voice?

74
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,490
It sort of gives me the creeps.

75
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,990
But why, I think it's rather charming.

76
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,990
That's so creepy.

77
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,890
I was so surprised.

78
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:29,290
Who would've thought you were the black knight?

79
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,990
You didn't even have the lines memorized,

80
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,190
you had some nerve doing what you did.

81
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,590
If you had kept ad-libbing it,

82
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,590
the play would have been ruined.

83
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,990
Sonoko, you rat fink.

84
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,190
You got it?

85
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,890
The black knight suddenly grabs the princess

86
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,190
and gives her a big kiss!

87
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,190
Don't do any talking until then!

88
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,390
So what did you think?

89
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,690
You mean the play?

90
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,990
That's a tough question.

91
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,690
Not the play, Princess Heart!

92
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,490
It doesn't matter so much, but I'd like to know.

93
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,990
I liked you in that dress!

94
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,790
Like they say, fine feathers make fine birds.

95
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,590
You looked nice!

96
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,890
What do you mean by that?

97
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,590
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

98
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,890
There's Conan!

99
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,690
Congratulations on being released from the hospital!

100
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,290
Hey! How have you guys been?

101
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,990
Hello...

102
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,190
Hey, who's that guy?

103
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,190
That's the high school kid who lives next door to Doctor Agasa.

104
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,290
Oh, from that haunted mansion.

105
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,290
By the way, Haibara said she had a cold

106
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,490
and wouldn't be coming to school.

107
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,490
Did you catch yesterday's soccer game?

108
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,390
-Yes, I sure did! It was fantastic! -I see.

109
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:44,590
I was one of them until just a few days ago.

110
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,790
It's so unreal. As if it was a dream.

111
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,590
Shinichi!

112
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,090
Come on, we've got to hurry.

113
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,590
We're going to be late!

114
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,290
Wait for me, Ran...

115
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,890
Huh?

116
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,690
No...

117
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,890
I was only kidding.

118
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,990
Good grief, stop playing games.

119
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,090
Act your age for goodness sakes.

120
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,290
I told you it was just a joke.

121
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,890
Kudo!

122
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,490
You just got back and you're already walking to school as a couple?

123
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,890
Idiots. We're not like that!

124
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,390
By the way, the new English teacher is one good looker,

125
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,290
she's a foreigner with a great body.

126
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,190
-Really? -Wait.

127
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,790
You know, you still haven't told me.

128
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,790
Told you what?

129
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,390
You told me you had something important to talk to me about.

130
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,990
Oh, that.

131
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,590
Listen.

132
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,990
You nosey bunch.

133
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,590
Stop eavesdropping!

134
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,990
Mrs. Kudo, help us!

135
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,690
-Tonight at 8, -Your husband has gone mad!

136
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,590
Beika Center Building,

137
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,790
rooftop restaurant?

138
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,290
Are you sure you can afford this?

139
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,290
This place looks awfully expensive.

140
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,690
Don't worry about it.

141
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,890
I've got my father's card.

142
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,690
You're a very bad son!

143
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:15,890
How can you say that?

144
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,590
My parents are worse, they left me all alone

145
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,590
and took off on a trip.

146
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:25,390
You and Conan are so much alike.

147
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,290
His parents are abroad, too.

148
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,490
-Really? -You know...

149
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,290
I've been thinking about this along time.

150
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,790
It concerns you being Conan.

151
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,290
I imagined that you got into some kind of trouble

152
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,290
and had to go into hiding,

153
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,590
so you took some kind of medicine or anything

154
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,390
that Doctor Agasa made to make you small.

155
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,290
Isn't that ridiculous?

156
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,090
You're almost right, though.

157
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,090
It's funny though.

158
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:01,090
Now that you're back, when I look at him,

159
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,090
he looks like a whole different person.

160
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,890
You idiot. Of course, he does.

161
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,190
Because someone else is disguising herself as me.

162
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,890
What did you want to talk to me about?

163
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:17,290
It's like this...

164
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,790
I just wanted to say...

165
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,190
"Beika Center Building's Observation Restaurant" -Sir.

166
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,590
Do you mean you're not going to the party?

167
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,590
Yes, I'm not feeling too good.

168
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,490
"Taiji Tatsumi (58)" -Give everyone my regards,

169
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,290
and ask them to work hard for the company.

170
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,290
Why is this elevator hall so dark?

171
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,690
Sir!

172
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,990
"Satoru Ooba (31)" -I got them to dim the lights...

173
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,390
for that surprise you're planning.

174
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,490
Oh, now I remember.

175
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,490
Well, say hello to everyone.

176
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,290
Goodbye...

177
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,490
Excuse me, could you tell me what room the party is in?

178
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,590
Ms. Sakurako!

179
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,690
The party's at the Italian restaurant back there.

180
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:03,790
I see.

181
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,690
Mr. Ooba!

182
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,890
Excuse me.

183
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,290
I have something to discuss with Ms. Sakurako.

184
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,390
Sure.

185
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,290
But the party's going to start soon, so don't be long.

186
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,590
Okay.

187
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,990
Mr. Ooba!

188
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,590
You're late.

189
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:26,290
You promised to meet me here before 8:30, remember?

190
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,590
"Sakurako Tatsumi (26)" -I'm sorry! It took me long to get ready.

191
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:33,590
But never mind that, did you tell dad about us?

192
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,890
Of course, I did.

193
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,790
I thought he'd be really mad,

194
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,790
but he gave his approval right away.

195
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,890
He said he trusted me and knew I'd take good care of you.

196
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,390
Then, we can married!

197
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,590
Yes.

198
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:49,490
Now, how about giving me a reward for being so brave?

199
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,790
Let's see...

200
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,290
How about a nice, big kiss?

201
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,490
Hey, the party has already started.

202
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,990
8:30, right on the dot.

203
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,890
Before we go to the party, here.

204
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,190
It's a present for you.

205
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,490
Oh, my. What is it?

206
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,490
It's a pink pearl necklace

207
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,690
matching with the earrings you're wearing tonight.

208
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,190
Thank you!

209
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,790
It's the least I could do.

210
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,390
Today is a very important day.

211
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,790
It's the day we become formally engaged.

212
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,990
So, you figured it out just by something like that?

213
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,990
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.

214
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,590
You know it!

215
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,990
And? What did you want to talk to me about?

216
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,390
About that...

217
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,890
Good grief. I know it's not easy to say,

218
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:58,890
but if you're a man, then act like one and get it over with.

219
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,090
You want to borrow my notes to study

220
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,590
for the time you weren't in class, don't you?

221
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,690
What?

222
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,890
Huh? Did I say something wrong?

223
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:06,990
I thought for sure that's what you wanted,

224
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,290
I brought you copies of it.

225
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,590
Well...

226
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,190
Actually, you're right.

227
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,390
I just didn't know how to ask.

228
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,590
I knew it.

229
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,290
Silly, that's not what I wanted to say!

230
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:26,990
The reason I asked you out to dinner is...

231
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:30,590
There's something I wanted to tell you.

232
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:36,690
It's...

233
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,790
What's that? Did someone scream?

234
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,790
Somebody probably just saw a cockroach or something,

235
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,890
don't worry about it.

236
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,790
Hey, come quick!

237
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,090
There's a dead body in the elevator.

238
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,490
Did anybody call the police?

239
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,690
So, here's what I wanted to say.

240
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,190
A gun, it's a gun!

241
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,890
They said the president of a company has been shot in the head!

242
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,490
It's like this...

243
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,090
You don't have to hold yourself back.

244
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,390
Huh?

245
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,690
I know you're dying to see what it's all about.

246
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,490
Well...

247
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,890
I'm not like some people, I won't run away or hide.

248
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,890
So go ahead and check it out,

249
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,690
Mr. Detective.

250
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,690
Get going! I might change my mind if you don't go now.

251
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,190
Ran.

252
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,190
Thanks.

253
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,690
I'll be right back.

254
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,190
Sure.

255
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,880
-Please, stand back. -So?

256
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,480
Has the victim been identified?

257
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,680
The victim is Taiji Tatsumi, 58 years old.

258
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,980
He's the president of a game company.

259
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,280
Those three were first on the scene.

260
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,980
They work for the same game company

261
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,580
and they were going to take this elevator

262
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,180
to get something they had forgotten in the office

263
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,980
when they found the body.

264
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,480
What did they forget?

265
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,180
It was a bouquet they were presenting

266
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,880
at the company's 20th anniversary's party

267
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,680
being held tonight at a restaurant here.

268
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,680
The game company occupies the 24th to the 36th floors of this building.

269
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,580
And this is their private elevator.

270
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,880
Mr. Tatsumi said he wasn't feeling well,

271
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,680
so he was going to drop by the office then head home.

272
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,880
His clothes are rumpled,

273
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,380
the killer must have gone through them looking for money.

274
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,580
Hey, wasn't there a similar incident here before?

275
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,780
It was when I just became a detective,

276
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,780
a young kid came and interfered.

277
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,180
I was still in elementary school then.

278
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,880
Excuse me, but I don't think this was a robbery.

279
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,580
That's right, it happened just like this.

280
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:03,180
If the killer had a gun and wanted to rob him,

281
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,880
he would have taken him to some place remote.

282
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,380
If he intended to search him for money after killing him,

283
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,480
there was no telling when someone would use the elevator

284
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,580
so staying here would be too risky.

285
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,380
Besides, who takes the buttons off the shirt's sleeves

286
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,280
just to search for money?

287
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,680
Isn't that right,

288
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,780
Inspector Megure?

289
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,480
Kudo!

290
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,480
Don't mention my name.

291
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,880
What, again?

292
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,480
But why are you here?

293
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,880
Ran and I were having dinner here.

294
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,280
Good grief, high school kids having dinner in a place like this.

295
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,880
Actually, I had a special reason for choosing this place.

296
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,880
Papa...

297
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,080
Mr. Tatsumi.

298
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,080
No! Who would do this to papa?

299
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,580
When we said goodnight to him here just a while ago,

300
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,480
he was just fine.

301
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,380
So, you people were the last to see Mr. Tatsumi alive?

302
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:04,580
The three of us saw him off in this elevator.

303
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,180
Ms. Sakurako arrived shortly after and...

304
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,880
She and I went over tonight's speech, then we went to the party.

305
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,380
Did anyone get into this elevator during that time?

306
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,080
No, no one.

307
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,980
Do you know what time it was?

308
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,280
Let's see...

309
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,580
It was 8:30!

310
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,680
The woppers were going off as the party started

311
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,280
and that's the time I saw showing, so I'm sure of it!

312
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,480
But you're not wearing a wristwatch.

313
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,980
I saw the time on Mr. Ooba's wristwatch!

314
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,880
It was when he touched my earring.

315
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,880
He touched your earring?

316
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,880
When we were here, he gave me a gift.

317
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,280
He said it's a pink pearl necklace

318
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,580
mtaching with the earrings I'm wearing tonight.

319
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,680
I was so happy, but...

320
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,080
Ms. Sakurako.

321
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,180
We'll have to return to the party

322
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,280
and tell the others what happened.

323
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:00,080
Ms. Sakurako, we should go too.

324
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,780
Officer Takagi.

325
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,080
Don't you think their story's strange?

326
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,580
Yes.

327
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,180
Well...

328
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,880
I do wonder whether she really saw the dial, though.

329
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,080
How dare you!

330
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,380
I certainly did see it!

331
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,580
I'm sure you're suspicious

332
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,580
because when you got here it was quite dark, wasn't it?

333
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,680
But as you can see,

334
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,680
the hands on my watch are luminous.

335
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,380
So, you can see the time even in the dark.

336
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,980
Mr. Tatsumi himself asked me to dim the lights in this hall,

337
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,580
he was planning a surprise.

338
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,780
I still think it's strange, though.

339
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,080
Hey, let me in on it too.

340
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,680
Hey, wait a minute.

341
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,080
What strikes you as so strange?

342
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,380
Just watch.

343
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,480
When you touch her earring with that hand,

344
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,980
you can't see the dial, can you?

345
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,980
Stupid, aren't you? You can see it if you touch her other ear.

346
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,180
Why deliberately touch the ear on your right?

347
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,480
Can't you see by looking at her?

348
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,380
That's the side her earring shows.

349
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,580
That's why I...

350
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,680
What about your right hand?

351
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,280
Wouldn't it have been easier to use your right hand?

352
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,380
Well, if your right hand was holding something,

353
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,680
you would have had no other choice, though

354
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,980
I wonder what it is?

355
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,180
I wonder what he wants to tell me that is so important.

356
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,180
What could it be?

357
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,080
You don't think he...

358
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,780
Hey, have you put on some weight

359
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,880
since the last time I saw you?

360
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,980
It's possible.

361
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,880
My clothes do feel tight lately.

362
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,480
But he wouldn't invite me to dinner just to tell me that.

363
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,180
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

364
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,280
Could you hold dessert until my friend comes back?

365
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,980
He ran off when he heard that scream just now.

366
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,680
But he's a detective,

367
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,680
I'm sure he'll solve the case and be right back.

368
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,080
I understand completely.

369
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,080
Huh? Is something wrong?

370
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,880
Oh, I'm sorry.

371
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,480
It's just that a former sommelier told me

372
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,780
about this legendary couple

373
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,080
and you two fit the description perfectly.

374
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,380
That couple sat at this very table, too.

375
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,680
It happened about 20 years ago,

376
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,480
the fellow from 20 years ago was a detective, too.

377
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,180
He returned to the table after solving a case

378
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,080
and shouted it out.

379
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,980
So, you'd better prepare yourself for it, too.

380
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,180
Prepare myself for what?

381
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,680
A proposal, he's going to propose!

382
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,080
Well, good luck!

383
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,480
Propose?

384
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,280
I don't believe it.

385
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,180
He wouldn't...

386
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,780
I don't believe it.

387
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,880
It's just not possible.

388
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,380
What are you getting at?

389
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,780
Are you implying I had a gun in my right hand?

390
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,880
A gun?

391
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,780
I never mentioned a gun.

392
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,880
Did you have one?

393
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,580
Inspector, who is this kid?

394
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,480
Well, he is...

395
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,580
I may not look it, but I'm a cop too, fresh out of school.

396
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,680
Isn't that right, Inspector?

397
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,480
Excuse me, you appear to suspect Mr. Ooba,

398
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,680
but if the three of them saw papa off here,

399
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,680
then Mr. Ooba couldn't possibly have done it.

400
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,980
He was with me after that.

401
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,380
Did you leave at any time?

402
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,380
I went to the restroom to put the necklace he gave me on.

403
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,480
While I was there, I retouched my lipstick,

404
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,080
it took about two or three minutes.

405
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,980
But we were talking through the walls,

406
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,580
so it was like being together.

407
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,480
Inspector!

408
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,780
We found a gun with a silencer and empty gun shells.

409
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,080
Where?

410
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,380
In the one of the building's trash dump.

411
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,280
It appears the killer threw it down the dust chute.

412
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,180
Is there a dust chute on this floor?

413
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,180
Yes, near the restroom.

414
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,580
I see.

415
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,780
So you could have it gotten rid of it

416
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,180
while carrying on with the conversation.

417
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,680
Oh, come on!

418
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,780
It seems you police are dead set

419
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,980
on making me out to be the killer.

420
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,680
So, tell me how I could have killed Mr. Tatsumi

421
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,980
after he left in the elevator.

422
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,580
I was with her all the time.

423
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,280
Besides, if I shot him,

424
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,980
there should be powder burns on my sleeve, right?

425
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,780
Then, will you allow us to check you out?

426
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,180
Go right ahead.

427
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,080
Then, follow me.

428
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,480
Mr. Ooba.

429
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,080
Pardon me, but did you...

430
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,580
and he kiss in front of the elevator?

431
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,080
Were you watching us?

432
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,880
No, it's something my mother told me.

433
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,980
She said a woman will usually re-apply Iipstick

434
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,580
only after a meal or after a kiss.

435
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,580
So tell me, how did he hold you?

436
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,080
How? Well, he put his arm around me like this.

437
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,680
At that time, wasn't your back facing the elevator?

438
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,080
Yes. As a matter of fact, it was.

439
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,280
Did you two always meet secretly like this?

440
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,180
Yes, we had arranged to meet here tonight.

441
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,780
Hey, what is this?

442
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,580
Thank you very much.

443
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,580
You were very helpful.

444
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,780
I'm sorry but I have one more question.

445
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:12,080
By chance, were those earrings also a gift from Mr. Oba?

446
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,880
Unfortunately, you guessed wrong.

447
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,380
I bought these this afternoon on the spur of the moment.

448
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,480
These weren't from him.

449
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,880
Is that so? Thank you.

450
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,380
I was right.

451
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,780
He killed Mr. Tatsumi after all.

452
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,880
It was Mr. Oba, no doubt about it!

453
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,200
Next Conan's Hint:

454
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,240
"Pink pearl necklace"

455
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,320
Next episode, Ran and I will have a...

456
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,220
-Happy ending... -Like that will ever happen.
