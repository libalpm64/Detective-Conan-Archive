1
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:04,694
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:04,694 --> 00:00:06,494
Turns out to a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:06,494 --> 00:00:07,994
The truth behind the murder committed behind illusion.

4
00:00:07,994 --> 00:00:10,594
Is it a cleverly devised trick or blinding magic?

5
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:12,094
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,094 --> 00:00:13,694
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,694 --> 00:00:15,594
His name is Detective Conan!

"Genyo Fuyuki Magic Show"

9
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:00,584
Pops received a call from the famous magician, Mr. Genyo Fuyuki,

10
00:02:00,584 --> 00:02:03,284
saying that he wants to meet Pops right away.

11
00:02:04,284 --> 00:02:05,784
"Genyo Fuyuki (35)" -Mr. Fuyuki says

12
00:02:05,784 --> 00:02:08,984
that someone in the troupe is after his life,

13
00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:11,384
so Pops has to find out who it is.

14
00:02:13,084 --> 00:02:14,484
There are five members in his troupe.

15
00:02:15,484 --> 00:02:18,384
"Misa Uehara (26)" -His assistant, Ms. Misa Uehara.

16
00:02:18,384 --> 00:02:20,684
"Chiaki Nakagawa (24)" -Likewise, Ms. Chiaki Nakagawa.

17
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:23,984
"Kazuma Ishida (19)" -Mr. Kazuma Ishida, who is in charge of taking videos.

18
00:02:25,084 --> 00:02:27,184
"Shingo Shoji (37)" -Mr. Shingo Shoji, in charge of stage performance.

19
00:02:28,484 --> 00:02:29,584
"Minoru Hasegawa (45)" -And Mr. Minoru Hasegawa,

20
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:31,584
who is in charge of operating the crane.

21
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,284
Afterwards, soon after conducting investigations,

22
00:02:34,284 --> 00:02:35,784
the magic show began.

23
00:02:37,784 --> 00:02:38,784
And...

24
00:02:49,684 --> 00:02:50,684
What the...

25
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:51,984
Shoots!

26
00:02:56,184 --> 00:02:57,984
Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki!

"Trick Versus Magic (Part 2)"

28
00:03:08,984 --> 00:03:13,984
"Genyo Fuyuki Magic Show"

29
00:03:23,384 --> 00:03:25,384
Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki!

30
00:03:25,384 --> 00:03:26,684
Just what are you doing?

31
00:03:26,684 --> 00:03:28,084
Hurry and unlock the lid!

32
00:03:32,684 --> 00:03:34,884
The curtains! Lower the curtains!

33
00:03:34,884 --> 00:03:37,084
Hasegawa, pull up the lid!

34
00:03:48,384 --> 00:03:49,584
Did something happen?

35
00:03:50,684 --> 00:03:51,984
The ambulance!

36
00:03:51,984 --> 00:03:53,884
-Call the ambulance! -Yes, sir!

37
00:03:53,884 --> 00:03:57,184
-Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki! -Mr. Fuyuki!

38
00:03:57,184 --> 00:04:00,284
-Mr. Mouri, please do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation! -Yeah.

39
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,184
Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki!

40
00:04:08,884 --> 00:04:12,684
Leader...

41
00:04:12,684 --> 00:04:14,684
-Mr. Fuyuki... -Leader!

42
00:04:14,684 --> 00:04:15,984
Mr. Fuyuki!

43
00:04:15,984 --> 00:04:18,084
Get a hold of yourself, Fuyuki!

44
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:19,384
-Leader! -Mr. Fuyuki...

45
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,484
-Mr. Fuyuki! -Mr. Fuyuki!

46
00:04:21,484 --> 00:04:22,784
Mr. Fuyuki!

47
00:04:22,784 --> 00:04:23,884
Mr. Fuyuki.

48
00:04:25,884 --> 00:04:27,084
No good.

49
00:04:29,684 --> 00:04:30,684
Leader.

50
00:04:33,584 --> 00:04:36,684
This is all I filmed.

51
00:04:36,684 --> 00:04:38,884
We got absorbed watching it.

52
00:04:38,884 --> 00:04:40,884
It's a valuable film though.

53
00:04:41,884 --> 00:04:43,984
It's amazing how you kept on filming.

54
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:44,984
It's nothing.

55
00:04:46,684 --> 00:04:48,384
Thanks to these videos,

56
00:04:48,384 --> 00:04:50,684
we have more or less an idea of what took place.

57
00:04:50,684 --> 00:04:54,784
But how was this magic supposed to work out in the first place?

58
00:04:54,784 --> 00:04:58,584
Mr. Fuyuki was supposed to be standing on top of the aquarium

59
00:04:58,584 --> 00:04:59,884
when the curtains were raised.

60
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:02,984
How was he supposed to escape from the aquarium?

61
00:05:02,984 --> 00:05:06,184
Well...

62
00:05:06,184 --> 00:05:09,184
We can't tell you from our side.

63
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,684
Why not? This is for investigation...

64
00:05:11,684 --> 00:05:13,384
Inspector.

65
00:05:13,384 --> 00:05:15,484
It doesn't matter if it's for investigation purposes,

66
00:05:15,484 --> 00:05:18,384
we can't reveal how the magic is performed.

67
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:19,584
I know how!

68
00:05:21,284 --> 00:05:24,884
The secret is on the lid of the aquarium, isn't it?

69
00:05:26,584 --> 00:05:27,984
Just as I thought.

70
00:05:27,984 --> 00:05:30,784
Hey, what do you mean by that?

71
00:05:30,784 --> 00:05:32,384
See, look at this.

72
00:05:33,384 --> 00:05:34,484
Huh?

73
00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:37,684
This latch doesn't have the pin that holds it in place.

74
00:05:37,684 --> 00:05:43,784
That's right, when the assistants put shackles on Mr. Fuyuki's legs,

75
00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:48,084
they locked the latch on the lid and also the padlock, right?

76
00:05:48,084 --> 00:05:51,884
They're both real, but they removed the pin holding the latch in place.

77
00:05:53,584 --> 00:05:56,084
That way, the lid comes off easily, right?

78
00:05:57,484 --> 00:06:00,284
Then, Mr. Fuyuki was put in the aquarium

79
00:06:00,284 --> 00:06:01,884
and was later covered with the curtains.

80
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:05,184
He used his abdominal muscles and got up

81
00:06:05,184 --> 00:06:07,584
and grabbed the handle that was hidden in back of the lid,

82
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:10,684
stuck his head out of the lid and took a breath.

83
00:06:10,684 --> 00:06:12,884
There's really a handle.

84
00:06:12,884 --> 00:06:14,984
So this is how it was.

85
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,484
Mr. Fuyuki immersed his body back into the water

86
00:06:19,484 --> 00:06:23,484
and showed that he was struggling in water after the curtains were raised.

87
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:25,584
Dad.

88
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:27,384
No, that's his performance.

89
00:06:27,384 --> 00:06:29,084
He's not giving any signal.

90
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:31,884
And when the curtains were lowered again,

91
00:06:31,884 --> 00:06:35,984
he removed the handcuff that was rigged earlier so it'll come off easily,

92
00:06:35,984 --> 00:06:39,484
and used his abdominal muscles again to get up.

93
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:42,084
He grabbed the handle that was hidden in back of the lid

94
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:44,184
and escaped from the aquarium.

95
00:06:44,184 --> 00:06:45,584
I see.

96
00:06:45,584 --> 00:06:47,484
Fantastic, Conan.

97
00:06:48,684 --> 00:06:51,284
I saw it on television before.

98
00:06:51,284 --> 00:06:54,184
Was what he said just now correct?

99
00:06:54,184 --> 00:06:55,284
Yes.

100
00:06:55,284 --> 00:06:57,684
Well, I guess so.

101
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,784
According to the report,

102
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:04,184
it is 10 to 1 that Mr. Fuyuki drowned to death.

103
00:07:04,184 --> 00:07:08,784
The question is whether this is just an accident or rigged by someone.

104
00:07:08,784 --> 00:07:10,584
I know who did it, Inspector.

105
00:07:10,584 --> 00:07:11,984
What?

106
00:07:11,984 --> 00:07:14,984
This is homicide and the murderers are...

107
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:18,584
Ms. Misa Uehara and Ms. Chiaki Nakagawa!

108
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:19,684
What?

109
00:07:19,684 --> 00:07:22,084
-Hey! -How can you say that?

110
00:07:22,084 --> 00:07:26,484
You both conspired to kill Mr. Fuyuki

111
00:07:26,484 --> 00:07:30,984
and pretended to remove the pin from the lid of the aquarium but didn't.

112
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,584
You've got to be kidding!

113
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:34,884
We removed the pin like we were supposed to!

114
00:07:34,884 --> 00:07:36,884
-See! -See it for yourself!

115
00:07:37,984 --> 00:07:41,184
Besides, the lid was opened like it's supposed to be, isn't it?

116
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:42,184
Look.

117
00:07:45,984 --> 00:07:50,484
You could've gotten the pins back when you were trying to save Mr. Fuyuki.

118
00:07:50,484 --> 00:07:52,084
Just what do you think you're saying?

119
00:07:52,084 --> 00:07:55,684
Chiaki and I were holding Mr. Fuyuki's body, you know.

120
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,684
You were the one that was holding the lid!

121
00:07:57,684 --> 00:08:00,084
Oh, that's right.

122
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:01,084
Pops.

123
00:08:02,384 --> 00:08:05,184
Wasn't the lid opened then?

124
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,184
I wonder if that's true.

125
00:08:08,384 --> 00:08:10,584
I was also thinking about that,

126
00:08:10,584 --> 00:08:15,984
but it was easy to open the lid when we were trying to save Mr. Fuyuki.

127
00:08:15,984 --> 00:08:18,884
Which means that the pins were removed.

128
00:08:20,284 --> 00:08:23,684
Let's watch the video Mr. Kazuma recorded one more time.

129
00:08:27,084 --> 00:08:28,084
After this.

130
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,384
Why did you pan it?

131
00:08:40,384 --> 00:08:42,084
Because I didn't want to reveal the trick.

132
00:08:42,084 --> 00:08:44,284
You can't possibly reveal it by filming it.

133
00:08:44,284 --> 00:08:46,384
Well, it's fine.

134
00:08:46,384 --> 00:08:47,384
Please show us the part

135
00:08:47,384 --> 00:08:51,584
where Mr. Shoji said he removed Mr. Fuyuki's feet from the lid.

136
00:08:51,584 --> 00:08:52,584
Yes, sir.

137
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,684
-Mr. Fuyuki! -Mr. Fuyuki!

138
00:08:56,684 --> 00:08:58,084
-It's after here. -Mr. Fuyuki!

139
00:08:58,084 --> 00:08:59,884
-Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki! -Mr. Fuyuki!

140
00:08:59,884 --> 00:09:02,884
-Mr. Mouri, please do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation! -Yeah.

141
00:09:06,784 --> 00:09:08,984
Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki!

142
00:09:13,484 --> 00:09:15,584
Leader...

143
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:17,384
-Mr. Fuyuki... -Leader!

144
00:09:17,384 --> 00:09:19,084
Mr. Fuyuki.

145
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:20,884
-Stop the video. -Yes, sir.

146
00:09:21,984 --> 00:09:23,384
Why did you pan it?

147
00:09:23,384 --> 00:09:26,384
I already told you to film the necessary parts.

148
00:09:26,384 --> 00:09:27,984
I'm sorry.

149
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,784
Too bad, isn't it, Inspector?

150
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:35,584
It is unlikely that Misa or Chiaki had anything to do with the murder.

151
00:09:39,484 --> 00:09:40,884
Kazuma.

152
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:42,284
Yes, sir.

153
00:09:47,184 --> 00:09:48,784
Come to think of it, Mr. Kazuma,

154
00:09:48,784 --> 00:09:52,184
you gave something to Mr. Fuyuki during break, didn't you?

155
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:53,984
Oh, it was medicine.

156
00:09:53,984 --> 00:09:56,484
Medicine? What medicine?

157
00:09:56,484 --> 00:09:58,884
A beta blocker.

158
00:09:58,884 --> 00:10:00,884
Beta blocker?

159
00:10:00,884 --> 00:10:02,284
It's a blocker drug.

160
00:10:02,284 --> 00:10:05,484
It lowers his heart rate.

161
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:07,984
He always drinks it about 15 minutes before performing

162
00:10:07,984 --> 00:10:10,884
the "escape from underwater" magic

163
00:10:10,884 --> 00:10:13,584
that requires him to stop his breath for a long time.

164
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:15,984
Is it under Mr. Fuyuki's orders?

165
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:17,884
Of course.

166
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:18,984
I got it!

167
00:10:18,984 --> 00:10:22,984
You switched that drug to a drug for hypomyotonia.

168
00:10:23,884 --> 00:10:25,984
"Kinchikannzai (Forbidden pervert crime)" -Forbidden pervert crime?

169
00:10:25,984 --> 00:10:29,184
"Kinchikannzai (Forbidden pervert crime)" -Just what're you talking about?

170
00:10:29,184 --> 00:10:30,984
It's a drug for hypomyotonia.

171
00:10:30,984 --> 00:10:32,584
Taking this drug causes a condition similar to adynamia,

172
00:10:32,584 --> 00:10:35,184
in which the hands and legs muscles lose strength

173
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:39,584
and it becomes impossible to get up using one's muscles, too.

174
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:41,984
But when the curtains went up once,

175
00:10:41,984 --> 00:10:44,684
although Mr. Fuyuki looked like he was struggling,

176
00:10:44,684 --> 00:10:46,084
he didn't send out any signal.

177
00:10:47,984 --> 00:10:51,284
Well, at that time, the drug was still not working.

178
00:10:52,684 --> 00:10:54,184
It started working when he tried to get up the second time

179
00:10:54,184 --> 00:10:55,684
using his abdominal muscle.

180
00:10:55,684 --> 00:10:57,184
Please wait.

181
00:10:57,184 --> 00:10:59,384
I respect Mr. Fuyuki, so why would I do something like that?

182
00:10:59,384 --> 00:11:02,884
Deep down in your heart, didn't you have a grudge against Mr. Fuyuki?

183
00:11:02,884 --> 00:11:06,884
He wouldn't let you be on stage as a magician for such a long time.

184
00:11:09,184 --> 00:11:10,384
That can't be.

185
00:11:10,384 --> 00:11:11,784
As proof of that,

186
00:11:11,784 --> 00:11:14,984
when everyone was trying to save Mr. Fuyuki,

187
00:11:14,984 --> 00:11:17,584
you alone kept filming the scenes.

188
00:11:17,584 --> 00:11:20,284
If you really respected your master,

189
00:11:20,284 --> 00:11:22,584
when the situation calls for life or death,

190
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:24,984
you couldn't possibly be filming the scene.

191
00:11:26,284 --> 00:11:28,184
That's because...

192
00:11:28,184 --> 00:11:29,784
Mr. Fuyuki kept telling me

193
00:11:29,784 --> 00:11:33,484
to always keep a record of everything that happens, even accidents.

194
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,584
He said that it would serve as proof

195
00:11:35,584 --> 00:11:37,584
that Genyo Fuyuki has always been a professional magician.

196
00:11:37,584 --> 00:11:38,584
Forensic officer.

197
00:11:38,584 --> 00:11:39,884
Yes, sir. What is it?

198
00:11:39,884 --> 00:11:42,684
Then, did you really switch the drugs?

199
00:11:42,684 --> 00:11:44,684
Of course I didn't do it.

200
00:11:44,684 --> 00:11:46,984
An analysis of the corpse's blood?

201
00:11:46,984 --> 00:11:47,984
I understand, sir.

202
00:11:47,984 --> 00:11:49,284
I'll be waiting.

203
00:11:49,284 --> 00:11:52,884
It's going to take some time before we get the results of the analysis,

204
00:11:52,884 --> 00:11:56,284
so I'd like everyone to wait in the waiting room till then.

205
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:59,984
"Genyo Fuyuki Magic Show"

206
00:12:06,984 --> 00:12:08,284
What's the matter, Conan?

207
00:12:09,484 --> 00:12:10,884
I need to go to the restroom.

208
00:12:12,784 --> 00:12:13,784
Gosh.

209
00:12:16,884 --> 00:12:19,684
Try to remember that magic.

210
00:12:19,684 --> 00:12:21,284
Where is it?

211
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:24,084
I'm sure that somewhere, the murderer's trick is hidden.

212
00:12:28,484 --> 00:12:32,184
Back then, the chain was lowered completely.

213
00:12:34,984 --> 00:12:36,584
Come to think of it, back then...

214
00:12:40,584 --> 00:12:41,584
Maybe...

215
00:12:42,784 --> 00:12:45,484
Let's take another look at the video.

216
00:12:45,484 --> 00:12:46,484
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

217
00:12:56,284 --> 00:12:57,284
Officer Takagi!

218
00:12:57,284 --> 00:12:59,184
Just what do you think you're doing, Takagi?

219
00:13:01,384 --> 00:13:02,784
I am sorry, I did it unintentionally.

220
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:06,284
-What's the matter with you, clinging on like that? -Give me a break.

221
00:13:08,184 --> 00:13:09,984
Come to think of it,

222
00:13:09,984 --> 00:13:11,984
after the curtains went down for the third time,

223
00:13:11,984 --> 00:13:13,684
it became pitch dark once.

224
00:13:22,884 --> 00:13:24,484
This latch...

225
00:13:24,484 --> 00:13:26,884
Huh? Did you find something again?

226
00:13:28,484 --> 00:13:30,684
Doesn't this latch look strange?

227
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,984
Isn't the middle part of the latch usually long?

228
00:13:33,984 --> 00:13:35,484
That's right.

229
00:13:35,484 --> 00:13:36,884
It's surprising that you noticed.

230
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:39,584
Besides, I wonder what this hole is.

231
00:13:39,584 --> 00:13:41,484
I was concerned about it, too.

232
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:44,084
It looks like someone tried to open it later after that.

233
00:13:44,084 --> 00:13:45,384
Later?

234
00:13:52,884 --> 00:13:54,184
Conan.

235
00:13:54,184 --> 00:13:56,684
You sure took your time in the restroom.

236
00:13:56,684 --> 00:13:58,684
I had a stomachache.

237
00:13:58,684 --> 00:14:00,384
Oh, well.

238
00:14:00,384 --> 00:14:01,684
Hey.

239
00:14:01,684 --> 00:14:05,684
Have you been using the same latch on the lid from before?

240
00:14:05,684 --> 00:14:06,884
The latch?

241
00:14:06,884 --> 00:14:08,184
No.

242
00:14:08,184 --> 00:14:10,684
It got old so it was recently changed to a new one.

243
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,984
And who changed it?

244
00:14:15,384 --> 00:14:16,584
I need to go to the restroom again!

245
00:14:17,784 --> 00:14:19,084
I got it.

246
00:14:19,084 --> 00:14:20,184
All I need now is proof!

247
00:14:22,384 --> 00:14:26,284
Watch closely. We may have overlooked something.

248
00:14:28,184 --> 00:14:31,584
-Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki! -Mr. Fuyuki!

249
00:14:32,984 --> 00:14:35,984
I've found the proof.

250
00:14:35,984 --> 00:14:38,184
The murderer is him after all!

251
00:14:45,989 --> 00:14:47,389
Nothing was detected?

252
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:50,489
Yes, we got report from the lab

253
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,989
that no traces of a drug for hypomyotonia

254
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:55,189
was detected in Mr. Fuyuki's blood.

255
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:57,289
So Mr. Kazuma is cleared.

256
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:01,889
We can't really get anything out of the video either,

257
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:04,489
so I guess we can't keep them here any longer.

258
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,889
Everyone, thank you for waiting.

259
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:13,689
Darn it! I was pretty sure I was right and yet...

260
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:15,489
Hey, Pops.

261
00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:16,689
What is it, kid?

262
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:21,489
This way.

263
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:24,089
What is this strange thing you're telling me about?

264
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:27,989
There's nothing here.

265
00:15:27,989 --> 00:15:29,289
Hey, kid!

266
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:43,289
Huh? Mr. Mouri said so?

267
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:46,189
Yeah, he told me to get everyone to gather at the stage.

268
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:48,589
Inspector, maybe...

269
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:50,489
He's here! Now, we will know the truth.

270
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:54,189
Hey, Officer Chiba.

271
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:01,589
Pops! Everybody's gathered!

272
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:09,789
Everyone, this case was indeed very peculiar.

273
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:11,289
What I mean

274
00:16:11,289 --> 00:16:15,789
is the magic that was performed on stage itself was rigged beforehand.

275
00:16:15,789 --> 00:16:17,089
The murderer rigged the magic

276
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:19,789
that was already rigged with his own devised trick.

277
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:24,289
This ended up in a double and triple trick.

278
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:28,589
But it is my mistake for not being able to see through it beforehand.

279
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:31,589
Although it's delayed, I'd like to point out the murderer

280
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:37,589
who killed Mr. Fuyuki with his cleverly thought out trick.

281
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:46,389
It's you, Mr. Shingo Shoji, the stage director!

282
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:47,589
What?

283
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,889
During the time the "escape from underwater" magic was being performed,

284
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:52,989
you, who were supposed to be watching the monitor

285
00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:55,089
was in fact, not there.

286
00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:57,789
You were on the beam right above the aquarium.

287
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:02,289
But if he were there,

288
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:05,789
wouldn't he be seen by the audience, Misa and the others who were on stage?

289
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:08,589
No, he couldn't be seen from the audience.

290
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:12,689
It was dark on top of the aquarium since the light did not reach there.

291
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:15,589
Of course, Misa and Chiaki who were on stage

292
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,689
and Mr. Hasegawa who was behind the stage, couldn't see him either.

293
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:19,489
No, we couldn't see him.

294
00:17:19,489 --> 00:17:20,789
True.

295
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,789
Let's say the murderer was hiding on the beam,

296
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:26,389
then how did he kill Mr. Fuyuki?

297
00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:27,989
From the camera shot taken from the audience,

298
00:17:27,989 --> 00:17:31,289
there were no signs of anyone approaching the aquarium.

299
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:32,989
That's right.

300
00:17:32,989 --> 00:17:34,589
It's impossible to approach the aquarium

301
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:37,889
without being seen by the audience or being filmed by the camera.

302
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:39,189
Impossible?

303
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:41,489
No, it's not impossible.

304
00:17:41,489 --> 00:17:48,289
When the curtains were raised showing Mr. Fuyuki struggling in agony,

305
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:51,589
you, who were on the beam, used the chain from the crane

306
00:17:51,589 --> 00:17:53,989
and landed on top of the lid.

307
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:01,589
The technique is possible

308
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:05,189
because of Mr. Shoji's experience of being a magician in the past.

309
00:18:05,189 --> 00:18:06,989
After he landed on the lid,

310
00:18:06,989 --> 00:18:10,989
he stuck the pin in the connecting part of the latch in question.

311
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:14,289
But how did he get back up on the beam of the ceiling?

312
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:17,689
Mr. Shoji did not go back to the beam of the ceiling.

313
00:18:17,689 --> 00:18:20,289
He came out of the bottom of the aquarium.

314
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:21,589
Bottom of the aquarium?

315
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:24,189
After the curtain was lowered,

316
00:18:24,189 --> 00:18:25,789
he jumped down from the top of the lid.

317
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:28,989
When the stage went dark for an instant,

318
00:18:28,989 --> 00:18:31,989
he swiftly came out from under the curtain

319
00:18:31,989 --> 00:18:34,689
and ran over backstage.

320
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:37,589
And when everyone realized that something was wrong,

321
00:18:37,589 --> 00:18:39,389
he made everyone bring Mr. Fuyuki down,

322
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:42,389
distracting everyone from the video and all.

323
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:44,789
So he should have the pins on him, right?

324
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:46,989
Takagi, search his body!

325
00:18:46,989 --> 00:18:48,389
Yes. Please excuse me.

326
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:49,489
Go ahead.

327
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:53,689
Please check very carefully

328
00:18:53,689 --> 00:18:57,089
because I can't take being accused as the murderer anymore.

329
00:18:57,089 --> 00:18:58,689
Inspector, he doesn't have it on him.

330
00:18:58,689 --> 00:19:00,389
Did you check thoroughly?

331
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,989
The pin is small, so he could've thrown it out somewhere.

332
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:07,889
According to reports from the forensic officer,

333
00:19:07,889 --> 00:19:10,789
there were no pins found on stage.

334
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:13,189
Maybe it's in the aisles or waiting room?

335
00:19:13,189 --> 00:19:16,689
Chiba was with them right through in the waiting room.

336
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:22,189
Even if we did find the pin, we have no proof that he threw it out.

337
00:19:22,189 --> 00:19:23,789
There is proof.

338
00:19:25,089 --> 00:19:27,789
Mr. Shoji didn't use a pin.

339
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:29,989
He used a ring instead.

340
00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:30,989
A ring?

341
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:33,989
Inspector!

342
00:19:33,989 --> 00:19:36,889
Please look at the latch on the lid of the aquarium.

343
00:19:36,889 --> 00:19:38,189
The latch on the lid?

344
00:19:38,189 --> 00:19:41,389
There should be a hole that shouldn't be on the latch's connector.

345
00:19:42,189 --> 00:19:43,289
This?

346
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:47,289
He pulled a ring that could be opened through the hole of the connector

347
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:50,189
and stuck it and rigged it so that the lid wouldn't open.

348
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,489
And that ring...

349
00:19:52,489 --> 00:19:56,889
Mr. Shoji, you're wearing it on your middle finger.

350
00:19:56,889 --> 00:19:57,889
Excuse me.

351
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:01,789
I found it. It's a two strand ring.

352
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:06,789
There is a slit in that two strand ring so they can easily be separated.

353
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:16,189
I'm sure it's rigged so that it can be twisted and opened even more.

354
00:20:16,189 --> 00:20:17,889
It's true.

355
00:20:17,889 --> 00:20:19,589
What's the meaning of this?

356
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:24,289
Being a magician, I can work out one or two tricks.

357
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:28,689
First of all, you've got no proof that I used that ring.

358
00:20:28,689 --> 00:20:31,489
Let's not be so unrelenting.

359
00:20:31,489 --> 00:20:36,189
Let's take a look at the video Mr. Kazuma took one more time, then.

360
00:20:36,189 --> 00:20:37,189
Officer Chiba!

361
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,489
Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki!

362
00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:46,889
Stop!

363
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:49,989
It's the ring!

364
00:20:50,989 --> 00:20:52,789
Which means...

365
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:56,189
It means I had the ring on all the time.

366
00:20:56,189 --> 00:20:58,989
Please look a little before this image.

367
00:21:00,489 --> 00:21:01,589
The ambulance!

368
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:04,389
The ring is not there.

369
00:21:08,689 --> 00:21:12,689
After he pulled me away from the lid,

370
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:15,889
he removed the ring that was put through the hole of the latch's connector

371
00:21:15,889 --> 00:21:18,789
and took off the feet shackles from Mr. Fuyuki.

372
00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:24,689
Mr. Shoji, do you admit to committing the crime?

373
00:21:26,489 --> 00:21:28,389
I have no regrets.

374
00:21:35,489 --> 00:21:39,189
Because I got to perform the magic of my lifetime.

375
00:21:40,489 --> 00:21:41,689
What did you say?

376
00:21:45,189 --> 00:21:49,189
Mr. Shoji, isn't magic supposed to entertain people?

377
00:21:49,189 --> 00:21:52,289
How could you think of using it as a tool to commit murder?

378
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:56,089
You're not only disqualified to be a magician,

379
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:58,289
but you're a failure as a human being as well!

380
00:23:31,589 --> 00:23:33,889
It's gotten so late.

381
00:23:33,889 --> 00:23:37,389
But your deduction was great again, Dad.

382
00:23:37,389 --> 00:23:38,889
Well...

383
00:23:38,889 --> 00:23:42,189
But I don't remember a thing.

384
00:23:42,189 --> 00:23:45,689
Hold it! This may be the ultimate magic.

385
00:23:46,689 --> 00:23:48,389
What's the matter?

386
00:23:48,389 --> 00:23:51,489
Ran, from now on, I'm making a change from the Sleeping Kogoro

387
00:23:51,489 --> 00:23:53,589
to Magician Kogoro.

388
00:23:55,589 --> 00:23:56,589
Huh?

389
00:23:57,689 --> 00:23:59,989
Shall I make you sleep again?

390
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,320
Next Conan's Hint:

391
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,480
"Stage actor"

392
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,040
In the next episode, the troupe in Konpira is in trouble!

393
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,720
I can make kinpira too, you know.

394
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,820
She's cracking an hour special joke.
