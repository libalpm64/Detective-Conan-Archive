1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,670
What lies in one's heart is a mystery to us all.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,570
Star and snow glitter on the two.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,170
Valentine's Day is coming up soon!

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,170
Would you like a case with chocolates?

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,770
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,570
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,070
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,680
Everyone has more or less gotten over the festive New Year holiday.

9
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,780
The girls send bitter and sweet chocolates to express

10
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,080
their feelings of superficiality or true love love to boys and men.

11
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,580
A gift-giving season in the middle of winter.

12
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,780
That is...

13
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,180
"Valentine's Day"

14
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:21,180
"Bloody Valentine (The Case)"

15
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,280
Valentine's my foot. Nonsense.

16
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,680
Everybody's just fallen for the tactics of the candy industry.

17
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,880
But I think people on the receiving end are very happy!

18
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,180
Besides, chocolate is good!

19
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,580
I bet you're all sulky because you're not going to get any.

20
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,780
Yes, you're so right!

21
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,280
With a body like this,

22
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,880
all I'll be getting are those for kids type chocolate anyway.

23
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,680
Well, he's right.

24
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,780
Japan's the only country where people are lightheartedly

25
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,680
getting all carried away over chocolate candies.

26
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,680
No one seems to be aware that Valentine's Day was named

27
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,980
in memory of St. Valentine who was killed after being tortured.

28
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,280
Is that true?

29
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,380
But my mother told me

30
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,480
that Valentine's Day is a day when girls create precious memories

31
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,980
after getting the power of love from the chocolates.

32
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,280
She explained that is why chocolates are bitter and sweet.

33
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,380
Then, did you buy chocolate, Ayumi?

34
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,380
No.

35
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,580
Father said it was still too early for me to do something like that.

36
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,580
Well, I guess it's too early for you to be talking about love.

37
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,580
And?

38
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,480
What did the detective agency girl say she'd do?

39
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,680
Oh, you mean Ran?

40
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,080
She said that we'd be going to a mountain lodge called Suito,

41
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,980
but she didn't mention anything about chocolate.

42
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,980
I see.

43
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,180
Well, I sure hope

44
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,180
it doesn't turn out to be a bitter memory like Bloody Valentine.

45
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,180
Hey, hey.

46
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,580
Bloody Valentine?

47
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,780
It's where Al Capone made the seven members of the Muran family

48
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,180
that he antagonize stand in front of the garage

49
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,380
and shot them to death

50
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,580
on February 14th, 1929.

51
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,580
Capone?

52
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,980
Come to think of it,

53
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,980
he said he was raised in the town where Capone was.

54
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,280
Conan, hurry or we'll leave you behind!

55
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,480
Oh, okay!

56
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,680
What were you doing?

57
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,480
-Sorry! -Hey, Haibara...

58
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,580
Good grief. Why do we have to go to a lodge

59
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,780
way out in the remote mountains to make candy?

60
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,780
We're training ourselves to become good wives!

61
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,280
You can do all you like of things Iike that at home.

62
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,280
Well, don't worry.

63
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,080
I heard nothing about making candy, though.

64
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,680
I was told that I'd get to see a lot of cute mountain animals.

65
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,480
Oh, you mean you don't know?

66
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,480
Suito Mountain Lodge is famous for being able to make chocolate

67
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,380
that will make your love come true!

68
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,080
What?

69
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,680
Which means that you're going to hand make the chocolate,

70
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,380
and give it to Kyogyoku,

71
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,280
then finally confess your feelings to him?

72
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,880
Yes, that's what I plan on doing.

73
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,280
What's the matter, Sonoko?

74
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,480
Makoto hasn't called me lately.

75
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,080
Even if I call him, his phone is always set at voice message.

76
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,280
No...

77
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,180
I guess I goofed.

78
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,780
I told him over the phone that I'm making chocolate

79
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,580
for somebody I really like.

80
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,480
I went all out with this "I love you a whole lot" strategy

81
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,380
I'm sure that's it.

82
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,380
I should've told him straight that the chocolate was for him.

83
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,280
Everything will be just fine!

84
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,280
If you send him the chocolate I'm sure that Kyogyoku...

85
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,580
You're so strong, Ran.

86
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,780
Huh?

87
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,580
Just one week of not talking to him makes me this sad.

88
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,780
But as for you and Shinichi,

89
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,480
this kind of thing has been going on all this time, right?

90
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,480
Well, I've gotten used to it.

91
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,080
And besides, who cares about whether he's around or not?

92
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,580
Hello, we've come to make chocolate!

93
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,280
How do you do?

94
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,180
Oh, so you're the old lady!

95
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,280
The owner of the lodge who is deceiving young women

96
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,480
ripping them off making candy

97
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,480
in a remote mountain lodge like this!

98
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,380
Hey, dad! Cut it out!

99
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,880
I'm so sorry.

100
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,480
"Chiyoko Yuasa (61)" -Deceive?

101
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,180
It's just that the press may such a big fuss over a couple

102
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,980
that coincidentally happened to get married

103
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,080
after making chocolate over here about 10 years ago,

104
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,880
and that reputation stands to this day!

105
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,180
My husband who was the previous owner passed away four years ago,

106
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,380
and thanks to a succession of spook scandals

107
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,580
the number of guests decreased drastically.

108
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,780
A spook scandal?

109
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,780
Well, I advise you all not to go outside alone

110
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,080
because a snowstorm is coming.

111
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,780
That is, if you don't want the spook that lives here

112
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,480
to give you a strange gift.

113
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,480
A strange gift?

114
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,980
Chocolate.

115
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,980
This mountain is pretty intricate,

116
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,480
and there are many people who get into trouble here.

117
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,180
The weird thing is, every year during this season,

118
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,380
chocolate is left

119
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,080
near the corpse that is found.

120
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,680
"Yoshitaka Nigaki (28)" -The local people say that

121
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,780
it could be the curse of a girl who was heading for this lodge

122
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,980
in order to make chocolate,

123
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,380
but died on the way after getting lost.

124
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,880
Or that it could be the snow woman.

125
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,280
There are various rumors going around.

126
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,280
Snow woman?

127
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,780
But there's nothing to worry about.

128
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,880
The police say that it's just that the chocolate

129
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,280
that is inside the belongings of the ones

130
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,480
who get into accidents in these mountains are scattered about

131
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,780
because of the hungry animals looking for food.

132
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,080
All right. I'll be going off to work, then.

133
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,080
Bye!

134
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,380
Mr. Nigaki.

135
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,280
I'm not against you pursuing it enthusiastically.

136
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,980
"Mika Konakawa (26)" -But don't let the show woman get to you

137
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,180
because of your enthusiasm and get yourself lost in the woods.

138
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,380
I'll be just fine!

139
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,080
If the snow woman offers me chocolate, I'll tell her

140
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,780
that I've got a girlfriend called Ako already.

141
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,080
"Ako Amari (25)"

142
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,430
Stop it, Yoshitaka.

143
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,930
See you, then.

144
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,730
Excuse me.

145
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,030
What is it, sonny?

146
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,530
He said he was going to work, but what does he do?

147
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,230
He's a journalist.

148
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,230
He went out to get films and pictures

149
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,630
that would serve as evidence of a case

150
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,330
he has been pursuing from five years ago.

151
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,930
I'm a photographer.

152
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,930
So in the beginning, I used to accompany him too.

153
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,830
Because he insisted he saw it in the forest.

154
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,130
He saw "it"? Don't tell me that

155
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,330
it was the snow woman?

156
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,730
No!

157
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,330
He's pursuing an animal that actually existed.

158
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,630
Well, I guess it's not much different from the snow woman

159
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,330
in terms that it is pretty much a phantom, too.

160
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,030
A phantom?

161
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,730
That's right.

162
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,030
Ever since it was caught and killed in 1905,

163
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,530
"Yuzo Sakami (42)" -the phantom mammal that hasn't be seen

164
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,630
for over a hundred years

165
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:38,030
and was written extinct on the red list.

166
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,130
The Japanese wolf!

167
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,930
A wolf?

168
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,930
Is it okay, though?

169
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,930
To go after such a valued animal

170
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,430
with a hunter's rifle like that.

171
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,530
Oh, you mean this rifle?

172
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,330
This rifle is used to threaten the wolf

173
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,830
and corner it into the trap.

174
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,130
Granny.

175
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,430
Take care of my friend that will be coming here soon, will you?

176
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:11,530
Talk about everybody getting infatuated over wolves!

177
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,230
Okay then, I guess I'll be on my way too.

178
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,030
When that guy's friend comes,

179
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,530
show them to their rooms, will you?

180
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,030
You mean you're leaving, too?

181
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,830
I'm going to visit my husband's grave that is in the woods.

182
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,730
Are you going to be okay going there all alone?

183
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,230
These mountains are like my backyard.

184
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,230
Besides, Saburo will go with me, too.

185
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,630
Saburo?

186
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,430
Oh, good boy!

187
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,830
Oh, it's a dog.

188
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,230
Don't tell me that the journalist who just went out

189
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,930
mistook that unleashed dog for a wolf?

190
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,430
No way.

191
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:02,230
It was 10pm when he saw the wolf.

192
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,430
Then, the more so...

193
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,230
Saburo is put in his cage after it gets dark.

194
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,330
Oh, I see.

195
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,630
Okay, so shall we start making chocolate

196
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,430
while granny's out?

197
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,630
-Okay. -Yes!

198
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,730
Huh? That granny are not the one who's going to teach?

199
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,530
She did before, though.

200
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,830
We're the ones who teach the guests now.

201
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,930
It's our way of thanking her for putting us up here

202
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,630
every time at this time of year.

203
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,730
But granny does do the finishing touches

204
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,930
on the chocolate, though.

205
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,330
I see.

206
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,930
I guess that thing about love what-nuts is something

207
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,430
that you can't really look forward to then.

208
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,530
Oh, shut up!

209
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,430
Okay, only three more days to Valentine's Day!

210
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,630
Let's give it our best shot!

211
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:02,330
Granny's husband died in an avalanche?

212
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,530
Yes.

213
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,530
Four years ago, on February the 14th.

214
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:10,130
It seems that he was buried under the snow for a week

215
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,430
until Saburo dug him out.

216
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:17,230
The other one was never dug out after all.

217
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,530
Huh? Another one?

218
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,430
My brother.

219
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,930
His whereabouts have been unknown ever since.

220
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:32,230
The police say that he's probably buried under the snow.

221
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,830
But I can't help feeling that he's still alive.

222
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,930
That's why I come here every year.

223
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:42,930
And besides, I visit the previous owner's grave, too!

224
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,430
I'm sorry for talking about something so glum.

225
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,930
Oh, no. Not at all

226
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,930
Is there anything can we help with?

227
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:55,330
No, no! Guys should stay out of the kitchen!

228
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,530
You'll get hurt like Mr. Nigaki did!

229
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,430
I'm sorry.

230
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,830
There.

231
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,530
Okay!

232
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,130
All right, I'm almost done!

233
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:10,030
Oh, how lovely!

234
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,730
Pretty good, pretty good!

235
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,230
That's true.

236
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,430
So why don't we all take a picture together with the chocolate?

237
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,830
-Okay! -Okay!

238
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,430
The blizzard is getting stronger.

239
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,930
I wonder if Mr. Nigaki is okay.

240
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:43,630
Sorry, but we'll go check on Mr. Nigaki.

241
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,730
So, wait here okay?

242
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,030
Okay.

243
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,830
Huh? Where are you going?

244
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,430
We'll be right back!

245
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,930
Mr. Nigaki, where are you?

246
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,030
Mr. Nigaki!

247
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,530
What?

248
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,830
Mr. Nigaki is nowhere in sight?

249
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:21,130
Yes. We split up to search for him, but...

250
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,730
The blizzard's getting worse!

251
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,930
Anyway, let's go search for him before the visibility becomes zero.

252
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,830
Conan, wait here in the lodge.

253
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,030
All right!

254
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,130
Like I'd do that.

255
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,030
Let's go, Saburo!

256
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,730
Yoshitaka!

257
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,030
-Mr. Nigaki! -Mr. Nigaki!

258
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,530
Where are you?

259
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,730
Mr. Nigaki!

260
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,130
Where are you, Mr. Nigaki?

261
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,930
Hey! Answer us!

262
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,430
Where are you?

263
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,330
Mr. Nigaki!

264
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,230
The sound of a rifle?

265
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,730
Looks bad.

266
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,730
Maybe he got to it first?

267
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,930
Who are you?

268
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,230
Me?

269
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,830
I'm a guest staying at Suito Moutain Lodge.

270
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,330
"Hajime Itakura (37)"

271
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:46,030
Darn it. Where the hell are you, Mr. Nigaki?

272
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,230
Hey, Saburo!

273
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,230
Mr. Nigaki?

274
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,630
Mr. Nigaki!

275
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,630
No good, he's not breathing.

276
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,130
He was beaten to death.

277
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,530
What's this?

278
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,730
A chocolate?

279
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,630
Yoshitaka, please answer me!

280
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,130
This is impossible. The blizzard's getting worst!

281
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,130
Hey, what are you going to do?

282
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,230
If we keep on searching the mountain like this,

283
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,730
we'll end up dead ourselves.

284
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:35,630
But we can't just leave Mr. Nigaki.

285
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,630
Huh?

286
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,630
A dog?

287
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,430
In a remote mountain like this?

288
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,330
Could it be Saburo?

289
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,730
It can't be! Because he should be back at the lodge!

290
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,830
Don't tell me it's Conan?

291
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,230
Conan?

292
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,930
Just what are you doing here?

293
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,430
I told you to stay at the lodge, didn't I?

294
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,030
I'm sorry.

295
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,530
But Ms. Mika said a while ago that

296
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:09,230
when the previous owner of the lodge got caught in an avalanche,

297
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,830
Saburo dug him out.

298
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,730
Huh? Well, yes.

299
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,230
That's why I thought that

300
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:22,030
maybe Saburo would be able to find Mr. Nigaki, too.

301
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,730
Since Mr. Nigaki had come to the lodge many times,

302
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,430
I was sure that Saburo would be familiar with his smell, too.

303
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,830
And? Did you find Mr. Nigaki?

304
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,030
Yes, we've found him.

305
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,330
But he's already cold...

306
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,030
What?

307
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,130
No, no way.

308
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,330
This isn't happening is it, Yoshitaka?

309
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,130
-Yoshitaka! -Stay away!

310
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,230
Look! His face are smeared with blood.

311
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,830
And there's a blood covered branch

312
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,430
that is on the ground right beside him.

313
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:01,530
This is undoubtedly a homicide case.

314
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,930
Now that we know it's a murder,

315
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,830
we can't mess this site up anymore.

316
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,030
Murder?

317
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,330
No way.

318
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,130
Hey, what's with that big shot attitude of yours?

319
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,830
You're not a police detective or something, are you?

320
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,830
You're right about I'm not a police detective anymore,

321
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,130
but I am an ex-officer and now detective, Kogoro Mouri!

322
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,630
What?

323
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,330
Mouri? Don't tell me that you're...

324
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,530
That renowned detective?

325
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:30,130
Then, do you know who the killer is?

326
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,630
No. Because his body is frozen from this cold

327
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,530
making it impossible to figure out the estimated time of death.

328
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:40,130
Moreover, the wind has blown away the footprints.

329
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,330
The only thing that may be left as a clue

330
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:46,830
is that Mr. Nigaki's blood may have stained the killer's clothes.

331
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:51,930
I'm pretty sure he was killed during the day time.

332
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,230
The reason why the blood on Mr. Nigaki's face

333
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,130
is wiped off part way

334
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,930
is that it had been wiped off when something rubbed against it.

335
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,930
And the fact that he is still wearing his goggles shows that

336
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,630
he was killed when it was still bright,

337
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,230
and the blizzard hadn't come yet.

338
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,430
It would be too dangerous

339
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:13,030
to move along in this blizzard with these goggles on.

340
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:16,330
I see Just as would be expected of a renown detective.

341
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,430
It's not a big deal.

342
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,630
This is a mere first step in any investigation.

343
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,830
I wonder about that.

344
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,330
Not you again.

345
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,130
Take a good look inside his goggles.

346
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,030
His left contact lens is out of place!

347
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,630
You idiot!

348
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,930
That's probably because he killer punched him...

349
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:40,330
But he's not wearing contact lens in his right eye

350
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,030
nor is it inside his goggles.

351
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,930
True.

352
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,530
Oh, I get it!

353
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,830
The right one probably fell to the ground when he was punched,

354
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,730
and at the same time, his goggles moved out of place,

355
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,030
so the killer fixed it for him!

356
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,730
I see.

357
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,530
What a meticulous killer.

358
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,730
Hey, this is no time to be convinced.

359
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:04,430
Could it be that the killer deliberately made him wear it?

360
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,930
That's right.

361
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,530
But why do something like that?

362
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:13,630
Come to think of it, I found something strange.

363
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,130
It's this chocolate!

364
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:19,030
I found it on his stomach.

365
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:23,130
Yoshi is written on it.

366
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,530
the chocolate you made today, Ako?

367
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,330
Why?

368
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,230
Why is my chocolate over here?

369
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,530
Aren't you the one who put it near the corpse?

370
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,330
Ako couldn't have done it!

371
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:41,530
The chocolate was in the kitchen until we all left the lodge.

372
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:46,330
She was with us right through after that.

373
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,430
Then, who put the chocolate over here?

374
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,930
It's probably the killer.

375
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:55,330
And it seems that the corpse has been touched everywhere, too.

376
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,130
It's pretty likely that the killer brought it here

377
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:01,030
to make it look like Ako committed the crime.

378
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,530
At any rate, let's talk this over after returning to the lodge

379
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,230
and contacting the police.

380
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,830
The police are not going to be able to get here for a while.

381
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,330
Hey, Mr. Sakami.

382
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,830
I'm surprised that you found this place.

383
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,430
I heard the dog barking.

384
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,830
Never mind that.

385
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,830
Just what do you mean by the police can't come here?

386
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,830
The tunnel located part way along the road

387
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,830
that leads from the foot of the mountain to the lodge

388
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,130
has been blocked off by an avalanche

389
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,230
that occurred about 30 minutes ago.

390
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,130
I'm pretty sure it's going to take at least a day

391
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,130
before they can open up the road again.

392
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,330
-Oh, no! -Seriously?

393
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,130
Then, what is it?

394
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,130
Are you saying that we're going to have to spend the night

395
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,830
at the lodge tonight?

396
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:46,230
When the one who killed Mr. Nigaki may be among us?

397
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,230
I don't have problem with that.

398
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,330
That's more thrilling.

399
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:55,330
If you don't want to spend the night over at the lodge,

400
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,430
why don't you spend the entire night

401
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:01,130
beside your big brother who was killed?

402
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,430
But by day break,

403
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:06,030
you may have turned into snow woman, though.

404
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,930
Blood stains that have been wiped off.

405
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:19,730
Goggles that were replaced on him.

406
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:23,130
And Ms. Ako's chocolate.

407
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,230
Why did the killer go out of the way

408
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:29,530
to bring Ako's chocolate out of the kitchen?

409
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:33,630
Why?

410
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,680
Next Conan's Hint:

411
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,240
"Playing ball"
