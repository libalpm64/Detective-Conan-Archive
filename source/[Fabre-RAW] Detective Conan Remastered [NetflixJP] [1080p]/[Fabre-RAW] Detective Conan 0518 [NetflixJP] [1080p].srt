1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,276
The start of the age of mystery.

2
00:00:00,276 --> 00:00:01,981
The detective show on Monday at 7.

3
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:04,376
The mystery code in Grandpa's diary.

4
00:00:04,376 --> 00:00:06,576
Treasure hunt in Yamaguchi.

5
00:00:06,576 --> 00:00:07,987
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:09,976
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:12,476
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:58,097
"The Meiji Restoration Mystery Tour: Investigation Chapter"

9
00:01:58,698 --> 00:02:01,698
This Shrine here, is dedicated to Yoshida Shouin.

10
00:02:01,698 --> 00:02:04,598
The man who trained people who went on to become

11
00:02:04,598 --> 00:02:08,398
the leaders of the Meiji Restoration of Japan.

12
00:02:08,398 --> 00:02:09,498
Shouin?

13
00:02:09,498 --> 00:02:12,998
He lived 150 years ago.

14
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:14,798
Meiji Regulation?

15
00:02:14,798 --> 00:02:18,117
Not regulation! Restoration!

16
00:02:18,117 --> 00:02:23,198
Shouin traveled throughout Japan to broaden his knowledge.

17
00:02:23,198 --> 00:02:24,498
And because he wanted to change the country,

18
00:02:24,498 --> 00:02:27,098
he also studied foreign systems as well.

19
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:29,098
That was when Japan kept out foreign cultures.

20
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:32,498
He studied Western culture, and, at the risk of his life,

21
00:02:32,498 --> 00:02:35,498
he even tried to stow away to America.

22
00:02:35,498 --> 00:02:38,998
But before his wish came true,

23
00:02:38,998 --> 00:02:41,498
Shouin was executed.

24
00:02:41,498 --> 00:02:45,698
Even so, others adopted Shouin's ambitions.

25
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,398
And his pupils who listened to his teachings

26
00:02:47,398 --> 00:02:50,149
and went on to change society!

27
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:51,498
Did you guys get that?

28
00:02:53,198 --> 00:02:56,155
Hey, why do all these kids have to come with us

29
00:02:56,155 --> 00:02:58,498
for our Japanese history assignment?

30
00:02:58,498 --> 00:03:00,159
Come on, it's okay.

31
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,398
This is going to be a really fun day.

32
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:05,898
That should be my line.

33
00:03:07,398 --> 00:03:08,167
What's going on?

34
00:03:08,398 --> 00:03:10,198
Give me that!

35
00:03:10,198 --> 00:03:11,598
No! Stop!

36
00:03:12,698 --> 00:03:13,698
No!

37
00:03:14,698 --> 00:03:16,198
Hey you!

38
00:03:16,198 --> 00:03:18,177
What are you doing?

39
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:20,598
Wait up!

40
00:03:22,998 --> 00:03:24,183
Are you okay?

41
00:03:36,498 --> 00:03:38,197
You were threatened?

42
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:39,298
Yes.

43
00:03:39,298 --> 00:03:41,198
They said, if I don't hand over this diary,

44
00:03:41,198 --> 00:03:42,698
they will harm me.

45
00:03:42,698 --> 00:03:45,298
And if I tell the police, they said I'd be jeopardizing my life.

46
00:03:45,298 --> 00:03:47,998
They told me that several times over the phone.

47
00:03:47,998 --> 00:03:50,209
Do you have an idea who it was?

48
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:52,498
No, I have no idea.

49
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,998
It looks like a very old diary.

50
00:03:55,998 --> 00:03:59,198
This is a gift from my grandfather.

51
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:02,998
But there are only riddles and puzzles inside.

52
00:04:02,998 --> 00:04:04,223
Puzzles?

53
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:06,598
My grandfather loved word games.

54
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:09,598
And he would write down those in this book.

55
00:04:11,198 --> 00:04:14,233
But before I could get all the answers to the puzzles,

56
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:18,898
my grandfather died five years ago on this day.

57
00:04:19,998 --> 00:04:23,298
My grandfather loved Shouin,

58
00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:27,098
that's why I went to the Shrine today.

59
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:32,251
But why would they want an old diary?

60
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:34,598
I do not know either.

61
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:37,998
Mr. Mouri, could you please investigate this for me?

62
00:04:37,998 --> 00:04:40,798
Of course, I'll get right to it!

63
00:04:40,798 --> 00:04:41,998
What's that?

64
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:44,898
That place that was torn off earlier,

65
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:46,598
there's something in it.

66
00:04:46,598 --> 00:04:47,998
What is it?

67
00:04:47,998 --> 00:04:50,298
It says, "On November 30th,"

68
00:04:50,298 --> 00:04:53,898
"the treasure will be revealed in the sunset."

69
00:04:53,898 --> 00:04:56,275
"Solve the puzzle of the fox"

70
00:04:56,498 --> 00:04:58,277
Treasure?

71
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:01,798
Ms. Kimiko, do you know anything about this?

72
00:05:01,798 --> 00:05:04,298
Treasure... I remember him saying...

73
00:05:04,298 --> 00:05:08,287
Kimiko, I have a magnificent treasure

74
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:11,698
that could buy the whole country.

75
00:05:11,698 --> 00:05:13,898
Wha... what?

76
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:16,698
Treasure that could buy the country?

77
00:05:16,698 --> 00:05:19,198
So, how many Unagi-bowls can I buy with that?

78
00:05:19,198 --> 00:05:22,301
Why does everything have to be measured with food?

79
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:25,098
But, what is this fox puzzle?

80
00:05:25,098 --> 00:05:27,198
Look at this.

81
00:05:27,998 --> 00:05:30,309
There's a picture of a fox here in this page.

82
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:33,198
"Feed the carps to the fox",

83
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:35,198
what does that mean?

84
00:05:35,198 --> 00:05:36,798
Carps in the moat...

85
00:05:36,798 --> 00:05:40,098
maybe it's about my hometown.

86
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:42,321
Where is that?

87
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:44,998
It's Tsuwano City of the Shimane prefecture.

88
00:05:44,998 --> 00:05:46,998
We have to go there at once!

89
00:05:46,998 --> 00:05:47,998
Why?

90
00:05:47,998 --> 00:05:51,098
Tomorrow is November 30th!

91
00:05:51,098 --> 00:05:55,398
We cannot let this chance pass us! We leave tomorrow morning!

92
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:59,298
But how are we supposed to get tickets now?

93
00:05:59,298 --> 00:06:01,198
Leave that to me!

94
00:06:01,198 --> 00:06:04,343
Sonoko Suzuki is here to help!

95
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:05,498
I'll use my family's connections,

96
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,347
and whether it's a bullet train or express,

97
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:10,349
I can get any ticket you need!

98
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:13,098
That's the power of the daughter of the powerful Suzuki Family.

99
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:14,098
Yes.

100
00:06:14,098 --> 00:06:17,298
And with this case in the hands of me, Kogorou Mouri,

101
00:06:17,298 --> 00:06:20,359
finding that treasure will be a piece of cake!

102
00:06:23,398 --> 00:06:25,398
We've got trouble.

103
00:06:25,398 --> 00:06:28,698
That woman has gone to see Detective Kogoro Mouri.

104
00:06:28,698 --> 00:06:32,371
I see, continue to monitor her moves.

105
00:06:40,798 --> 00:06:44,798
Thank you for accepting this case.

106
00:06:44,798 --> 00:06:46,998
No need to thank me!

107
00:06:46,998 --> 00:06:49,798
What does it mean?

108
00:06:49,798 --> 00:06:52,198
"Feed the carps to the fox".

109
00:06:52,198 --> 00:06:54,698
Do you think carp are tasty?

110
00:06:54,698 --> 00:06:56,798
Why do you guys have to tag along, too?

111
00:06:56,798 --> 00:06:58,397
Well, we think that's as plain as the nose on your face.

112
00:06:58,397 --> 00:07:01,998
We're the ones who saved Ms. Kimiko in the first place!

113
00:07:01,998 --> 00:07:03,498
Jeez...

114
00:07:03,498 --> 00:07:05,598
Writing down puzzles in a diary.

115
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:08,698
Your grandfather must have been very creative.

116
00:07:08,698 --> 00:07:12,798
Yes, he was always thinking about interesting things.

117
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:16,998
Kimiko, how many stamps

118
00:07:16,998 --> 00:07:21,498
do you need to send a letter to the future?

119
00:07:21,498 --> 00:07:23,198
Letter to the future?

120
00:07:23,198 --> 00:07:25,998
What is the answer?

121
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:29,298
He never told me.

122
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:39,198
Shin-Yamaguchi Station!

123
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:44,443
From here we will take the Yamaguchi Line to get to Tsuwano.

124
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:46,445
Kimiko!

125
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:48,098
Kimiko, are you okay?

126
00:07:48,098 --> 00:07:49,598
Yes... Yes, I am.

127
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:51,598
Kimiko, who is this?

128
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:54,453
I'm Shigeru Kawaguchi, Kimiko's friend!

129
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:57,698
I heard about what happened in Tokyo.

130
00:07:57,698 --> 00:08:00,459
We were the ones who save her, you know!

131
00:08:01,798 --> 00:08:03,798
And we are...

132
00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:05,598
The Youth Detective Squad!

133
00:08:07,298 --> 00:08:09,298
Good for you, guys.

134
00:08:09,298 --> 00:08:11,598
I owe you for protecting my friend.

135
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,298
So, Kimiko, you're going back to Tsuwano, right?

136
00:08:15,298 --> 00:08:17,198
Yes... I am...

137
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:22,498
Ms. Kimiko?

138
00:08:22,498 --> 00:08:25,998
Hey, it's me! Nine tickets were enough!

139
00:08:25,998 --> 00:08:28,487
Cancel the rest.

140
00:08:33,598 --> 00:08:34,898
Wow!

141
00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:37,198
I can feel the heat!

142
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:39,198
The smell of it is amazing!

143
00:08:39,198 --> 00:08:41,698
All of you! Get on board this instant!

144
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:42,998
Okay!

145
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:48,298
"Shin-Yamaguchi to Tsuwano"

146
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,498
For a limited time period,

147
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:55,298
real steam locomotives service the Yamaguchi Line.

148
00:08:55,298 --> 00:08:57,598
It seems like there are no seats left.

149
00:08:57,598 --> 00:09:00,898
How did you get these tickets?

150
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:04,523
I have some connections. It's pretty easy.

151
00:09:04,698 --> 00:09:06,525
Is there any hot spring spot?

152
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:09,298
Around here, the Yuda hot springs are famous.

153
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:13,598
That guy, Shigeru Kawaguchi isn't his real name.

154
00:09:13,598 --> 00:09:14,898
So you noticed?

155
00:09:14,898 --> 00:09:19,298
Kimiko's cell phone strap and his pendant are the same.

156
00:09:19,298 --> 00:09:20,898
There are initials engraved in the back of each one.

157
00:09:20,898 --> 00:09:24,543
Kimiko's is "K.K" for Kimiko Kobayakawa.

158
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:26,298
But his says "A.T."

159
00:09:26,298 --> 00:09:27,598
If his name is Shiegeru Kawaguchi,

160
00:09:27,598 --> 00:09:29,598
it should be "S.K." right?

161
00:09:29,598 --> 00:09:32,551
I wonder why he is hiding his real name.

162
00:09:33,598 --> 00:09:37,298
I have some connections. It's pretty easy.

163
00:09:37,298 --> 00:09:38,557
I'll use my family's connections,

164
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:41,498
and whether it's a bullet train or express,

165
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,998
I can get any ticket you need!

166
00:09:43,998 --> 00:09:45,698
That means he might be connected

167
00:09:45,698 --> 00:09:48,098
to someone powerful in this area.

168
00:10:01,598 --> 00:10:03,298
What are you trying to do?

169
00:10:03,298 --> 00:10:05,598
Listen to me!

170
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:07,798
What's the matter?

171
00:10:07,798 --> 00:10:10,098
Oh, I was looking for the bathroom.

172
00:10:10,098 --> 00:10:12,298
Oh, it's that way.

173
00:10:12,298 --> 00:10:13,998
Thanks!

174
00:10:19,198 --> 00:10:22,601
Tsuwano!

175
00:10:23,598 --> 00:10:25,698
Excuse me, are you Mr. Mouri?

176
00:10:25,698 --> 00:10:27,298
Yes, that is me.

177
00:10:27,298 --> 00:10:29,798
Thank you for coming from so far.

178
00:10:29,798 --> 00:10:33,698
My name is Tsuneo Kikkawa. I work for the Kobayakawa family.

179
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:35,998
Thank you for waiting on us.

180
00:10:35,998 --> 00:10:38,398
Where is Ms. Kimiko?

181
00:10:38,398 --> 00:10:40,619
She was with us just now.

182
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:42,621
Maybe she got kidnapped?

183
00:10:42,798 --> 00:10:44,623
I'm here!

184
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:46,625
I forgot to get a gift for my mother.

185
00:10:46,798 --> 00:10:48,398
I just ran to get something.

186
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,498
That's a relief!

187
00:10:49,498 --> 00:10:50,629
It's funny that

188
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:53,398
I was just in Tokyo, but I'm buying her a gift here.

189
00:10:55,298 --> 00:10:57,198
Where did your friend go?

190
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,698
He left already.

191
00:10:59,698 --> 00:11:01,098
Come on, let's go.

192
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:08,647
Development is our town's future!

193
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:11,098
And I believe everyone knows what I've done for the community.

194
00:11:11,098 --> 00:11:12,298
Who is that?

195
00:11:13,698 --> 00:11:15,698
His name is Hisamichi Takahashi.

196
00:11:15,698 --> 00:11:17,998
He is involved in real estate and construction

197
00:11:17,998 --> 00:11:19,198
around this area.

198
00:11:19,198 --> 00:11:20,659
He has extensive business operations,

199
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:23,098
developing resorts and such.

200
00:11:23,098 --> 00:11:24,663
Now he's announcing his candidacy

201
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:26,998
as a member of the prefectural assembly.

202
00:11:26,998 --> 00:11:32,098
And this area will be vitalized and life will be better for everyone.

203
00:11:32,098 --> 00:11:34,673
And the one who can do it is me, Hisamichi Takahashi!

204
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:37,198
And only me, Hisamichi Takahashi!

205
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:39,298
Mr. Takahashi makes me feel safe and secure.

206
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:42,681
Yes, he's the one who loves this town the most.

207
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:45,998
To think such a splendid father could have a son like that is too bad...

208
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:48,098
Atsushi, right?

209
00:11:48,098 --> 00:11:51,698
How long is he going to keep acting like a punk?

210
00:11:52,998 --> 00:11:55,798
This is Tonomachi Street.

211
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:59,698
And this is where the ancient samurai houses are still standing.

212
00:11:59,698 --> 00:12:01,798
Wow, look at the size of that carp!

213
00:12:01,798 --> 00:12:06,998
In the old days, they were raised as emergency food.

214
00:12:06,998 --> 00:12:10,498
Are we going to feed all the carp to the fox?

215
00:12:10,498 --> 00:12:13,498
What are you talking about? This is a puzzle, remember?

216
00:12:13,498 --> 00:12:16,098
We're not actually gonna feed them!

217
00:12:16,098 --> 00:12:17,398
I know that bit!

218
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:21,198
Thank you so much.

219
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:24,723
No need to. I am glad that your daughter is back safe.

220
00:12:24,898 --> 00:12:29,698
Our house was recently robbed too.

221
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:30,729
What?

222
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:33,898
Maybe they were looking for the diary?

223
00:12:33,898 --> 00:12:35,498
Maybe so.

224
00:12:36,498 --> 00:12:41,098
Mr. Mouri, please catch the people who are doing this.

225
00:12:41,098 --> 00:12:43,098
Of course.

226
00:12:43,098 --> 00:12:45,598
So, it seems that Ms. Kimiko has heard

227
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,798
about this treasure from her grandfather.

228
00:12:47,798 --> 00:12:49,198
Have you heard of this before?

229
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:52,751
Yes, I have heard about it.

230
00:12:52,998 --> 00:12:55,198
I heard that, because of this treasure,

231
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:59,298
the Kobayakawa family was restored after the War.

232
00:12:59,298 --> 00:13:05,298
But I know that it wasn't only because of this treasure.

233
00:13:05,298 --> 00:13:07,998
It was by my father's hard work that made it happen.

234
00:13:07,998 --> 00:13:11,998
But there are some who don't think so.

235
00:13:11,998 --> 00:13:14,773
Especially some people who rose to power in the turmoil

236
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:16,398
after the Second World War.

237
00:13:16,398 --> 00:13:20,779
Since we've been deeply trusted by the local people historically,

238
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:23,498
they take advantage of every opportunity to get at the Kobayakawa family.

239
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:28,787
I see, so they might be the ones after the diary.

240
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:32,791
-We have to find the treasure before they do. -Yes.

241
00:13:32,998 --> 00:13:36,098
Can I eat now?

242
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:38,098
Oh, I'm so sorry!

243
00:13:38,098 --> 00:13:39,798
Please go ahead!

244
00:13:39,798 --> 00:13:41,398
Thank you!

245
00:13:41,398 --> 00:13:43,798
It is the sweets from Yamaguchi Prefecture.

246
00:13:43,798 --> 00:13:47,598
It is slightly different from the ones in Nagoya.

247
00:13:50,398 --> 00:13:52,598
-It's so good! -It's like jelly!

248
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,813
Mine already gone!

249
00:13:58,198 --> 00:14:03,598
To feed the fox the carp means the carp disappear.

250
00:14:03,598 --> 00:14:04,823
Mitsuhiko,

251
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:06,498
can you hand me the copy of this picture?

252
00:14:06,498 --> 00:14:08,498
Yeah, sure.

253
00:14:11,598 --> 00:14:13,898
-Conan? -What's going on?

254
00:14:15,498 --> 00:14:16,835
How about this way?

255
00:14:18,298 --> 00:14:20,839
The carp disappeared!

256
00:14:21,698 --> 00:14:23,598
-It's true. -Oh, my...

257
00:14:23,598 --> 00:14:27,998
"Feed the carp" should be about this!

258
00:14:27,998 --> 00:14:32,198
Well, you just folded it.

259
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:33,998
But look, there are letters.

260
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:34,853
What?

261
00:14:35,098 --> 00:14:38,857
The patterns come together and form letters!

262
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:42,498
"Below the top of the hidden Inari"?

263
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:44,198
Inari.

264
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:46,865
I can only think of the Taikodani Inari Shrine in this area.

265
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:50,598
That's it! The treasure is at the Taikodani Inari Shrine!

266
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,871
All right, let's go!

267
00:15:00,627 --> 00:15:04,627
This is... an amazing numbers of arches...

268
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:07,627
Yes, there are almost a thousand arches.

269
00:15:07,627 --> 00:15:09,627
A thousand?

270
00:15:09,627 --> 00:15:12,327
Are we going to walk up there?

271
00:15:12,327 --> 00:15:14,327
We have no choice.

272
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:20,899
I can't do it!

273
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:23,827
Come on, Genta!

274
00:15:23,827 --> 00:15:26,027
Just a little more!

275
00:15:34,127 --> 00:15:35,427
We made it!

276
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:39,427
-It's pretty. -Look at the view!

277
00:15:39,427 --> 00:15:44,923
So what does " Below the top of the hidden Inari" mean?

278
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:46,427
Hey, what's that?

279
00:15:46,427 --> 00:15:50,027
-Is it food? -Fried tofu?

280
00:15:50,027 --> 00:15:52,931
That is not for eating. It's an offering.

281
00:15:53,127 --> 00:15:56,227
Because fried tofu is the fox's favorite food.

282
00:15:56,227 --> 00:15:58,937
Where do they put them?

283
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:00,627
Are you planning to steal them?

284
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,527
You'll get punished!

285
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:05,527
I'm just asking!

286
00:16:05,527 --> 00:16:08,427
They either put it at the main building,

287
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:11,327
or in the shrine at the back.

288
00:16:11,327 --> 00:16:15,227
Maybe that's the hidden Inari?

289
00:16:19,327 --> 00:16:20,959
Here?

290
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:23,927
I don't see anything.

291
00:16:23,927 --> 00:16:26,327
I found the fried tofu!

292
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:28,967
Now you know you can't get them.

293
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:32,327
-I said I'm not! -This is awesome.

294
00:16:32,327 --> 00:16:34,527
Hey guys, look at this!

295
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:37,627
So many foxes in there!

296
00:16:37,627 --> 00:16:38,977
You're right.

297
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:40,979
It's cool.

298
00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:44,983
I know! The hidden Inari is around here!

299
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:47,727
No, not there, it's here.

300
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:54,327
This is the hidden Inari.

301
00:16:54,327 --> 00:16:57,527
Now, "Below the top of the hidden Inari"

302
00:16:57,527 --> 00:17:00,999
There is a fried tofu figure made of stone.

303
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:02,627
Fried tofu?

304
00:17:02,627 --> 00:17:05,327
I got it! The kanji that means "Top"

305
00:17:05,327 --> 00:17:07,005
also could translate to the meaning of fried tofu.

306
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:11,527
So the treasure should be under the fried tofu made of stone!

307
00:17:11,527 --> 00:17:15,627
-Awesome, Mitsuhiko! -You are a genius!

308
00:17:15,627 --> 00:17:17,727
Thanks, guys!

309
00:17:19,927 --> 00:17:21,019
A jar?

310
00:17:22,027 --> 00:17:23,927
What's in there?

311
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:27,927
Well, there is some kind of paper.

312
00:17:27,927 --> 00:17:29,927
This is...

313
00:17:29,927 --> 00:17:31,627
It looks like a map.

314
00:17:31,627 --> 00:17:34,027
There's something written on the top!

315
00:17:34,027 --> 00:17:35,727
What does it say?

316
00:17:35,727 --> 00:17:37,727
"Reflect the castle in the eye of the cat"

317
00:17:37,727 --> 00:17:40,227
"and look under the mouse."

318
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:41,827
What does that mean?

319
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,727
A cat...

320
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:47,045
It should be about this.

321
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:49,527
I see holes in it.

322
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:53,051
Not a mouse in any of the pages.

323
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:55,327
Another puzzle, huh?

324
00:17:55,327 --> 00:18:00,427
This seems like the old map of the city of Hagi.

325
00:18:00,427 --> 00:18:03,427
Hagi is in Yamaguchi Prefecture.

326
00:18:03,427 --> 00:18:08,327
Yes, the city is linked to Shouin whom my grandfather adored.

327
00:18:08,327 --> 00:18:12,627
I see, so the treasure should be in Hagi.

328
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:16,727
I see. They are headed for Hagi.

329
00:18:16,727 --> 00:18:20,127
Stay with them, you hear me?

330
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:26,727
Where is Kimiko?

331
00:18:27,827 --> 00:18:30,227
I'm coming!

332
00:18:39,527 --> 00:18:41,927
It feels like a very old town.

333
00:18:41,927 --> 00:18:45,427
They have preserved the town as it is was like in the old days.

334
00:18:45,427 --> 00:18:48,227
So you can even walk through the town

335
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,727
even if you had a map from the Edo Period!

336
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:52,327
That is marvelous!

337
00:18:52,327 --> 00:18:55,113
The many people who were involved in the Meiji Restoration

338
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:57,115
have also seen this same view today.

339
00:18:57,115 --> 00:19:00,527
That's right! This is where the Meiji Restoration all began!

340
00:19:00,527 --> 00:19:02,927
Here we go. The Meiji Reservation.

341
00:19:02,927 --> 00:19:05,127
Restoration!

342
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:07,927
That's the reform that gave Japan its chance

343
00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:10,227
to become a modern country like it is today.

344
00:19:10,227 --> 00:19:13,127
Many people who were involved in the Meiji Restoration

345
00:19:13,127 --> 00:19:15,127
were from Hagi.

346
00:19:15,127 --> 00:19:16,527
I see!

347
00:19:16,527 --> 00:19:19,137
"Hagi Museum East Entrance"

348
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,627
The Cat Street?

349
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:25,427
Does this have anything to do with that code?

350
00:19:25,427 --> 00:19:31,149
About 250 streets are named like that.

351
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:34,527
This street is named after a person who was close to Terumoto Mouri,

352
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,627
and since he was fond of cats,

353
00:19:37,627 --> 00:19:39,927
they called it the Cat Street.

354
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:43,161
Look! A real cat!

355
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:47,827
Oh, kitty cat! I know, I got it!

356
00:19:47,827 --> 00:19:50,227
You mean you solved the puzzle?

357
00:19:50,227 --> 00:19:51,169
Yes!

358
00:19:51,327 --> 00:19:54,627
They meant the white walls, not the castle!

359
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:57,827
That means that one of these cats is watching a wall

360
00:19:57,827 --> 00:20:01,827
which will point out where the treasure is!

361
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:05,183
And that cat right there is looking at it right...

362
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:07,185
Wait! Please wait, Kitty!

363
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:10,227
I'm very sure that he is wrong.

364
00:20:10,227 --> 00:20:13,527
Mr. Mouri sure has a sense of humor.

365
00:20:13,527 --> 00:20:16,227
The problem is that he's dead serious.

366
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:24,427
That was the guy who called himself Shigeru Kawaguchi?

367
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:31,527
Can't you understand what I'm saying?

368
00:20:31,527 --> 00:20:33,527
But...

369
00:20:33,527 --> 00:20:35,827
It is him.

370
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:38,327
That man...

371
00:20:40,727 --> 00:20:43,221
The guy who attacked Kimiko!

372
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:48,127
This is where the doctor in the Edo period named Shusuke Aoki

373
00:20:48,127 --> 00:20:49,727
was living.

374
00:20:49,727 --> 00:20:52,427
They say that they found treasure buried here.

375
00:20:52,427 --> 00:20:54,327
You know well!

376
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:56,127
Really?

377
00:20:56,127 --> 00:20:59,627
Yes, they say that they found it from under the cellar.

378
00:20:59,627 --> 00:21:01,827
Treasure!

379
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,327
There is a treasure, I'm sure!

380
00:21:04,327 --> 00:21:05,727
I think so too!

381
00:21:05,727 --> 00:21:07,245
I'm getting excited!

382
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:09,927
Me too!

383
00:21:09,927 --> 00:21:12,827
Now, let's head to the Hagi Castle!

384
00:21:19,827 --> 00:21:24,327
What does Shigeru have to do with those men?

385
00:21:24,327 --> 00:21:26,727
And who is he exactly?

386
00:21:29,527 --> 00:21:32,027
-Hurry up! -Be quiet!

387
00:21:32,027 --> 00:21:35,273
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

388
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:37,827
-The keys! -You little brat!

389
00:21:37,827 --> 00:21:40,327
Police! This way! Come quick!

390
00:21:40,327 --> 00:21:42,127
Hurry up! We're moving!

391
00:21:44,027 --> 00:21:45,283
Mitsuhiko!

392
00:21:46,327 --> 00:21:47,827
What's going on?

393
00:21:47,827 --> 00:21:49,027
Thanks!

394
00:21:55,627 --> 00:21:57,027
You're not getting away!

395
00:22:04,227 --> 00:22:06,027
Crack!

396
00:22:06,027 --> 00:22:09,307
No, I didn't think they would go this far.

397
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:12,727
I didn't pay enough attention.

398
00:22:12,727 --> 00:22:16,927
Is there really a treasure that could buy a country?

399
00:22:16,927 --> 00:22:22,327
And who are those men?

400
00:22:22,327 --> 00:22:23,827
And that voice...

401
00:22:23,827 --> 00:22:26,427
Police! This way! Come quick!

402
00:22:26,427 --> 00:22:28,827
I know that voice, and it is...

403
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,420
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,020
"Cat"

405
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,238
Meow! Treasure discovered in the next episode!

406
00:23:58,238 --> 00:23:59,834
How many servings of broiled eel on rice will I be able to eat?

407
00:23:59,834 --> 00:24:00,980
One-track mind.
