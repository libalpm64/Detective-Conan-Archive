1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,870
Younger brother!

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,170
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,470
Disclose the surprising secret hidden in the red light

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,470
that brings back memories even after ten years!

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,870
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,270
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,170
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,520
Ms. Kobayashi finds a leather wallet in the library.

9
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,720
In the wallet was a message that Ran wrote when she was in first grade.

10
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,720
"Thank you, Ran Mouri of 1st grade class A."

11
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,620
Ten years ago,

12
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,720
we were given a code in the school library from a man

13
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,720
who claimed to be "Shinichi's younger brother",

14
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,920
and end up going on a treasure hunt.

15
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,420
-"Erase..." -"Erase..."

16
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,620
"The mark of Okuho."

17
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,620
"Clench your teeth in solitaire with an unclear voice"

18
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:36,020
"The Adventures of Young Shinichi Kudo (Part 2)"

19
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,120
"Erase the mark of Okuho."

20
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,520
"Clench your teeth in solitaire with an unclear voice"

21
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,520
"Okuho" is the name of a town and may be referring to Okuho-cho,

22
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,220
but the word after that is Greek to me.

23
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,420
Maybe it's a dentist?

24
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,020
It says, "Clench your teeth"...

25
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,520
No, that's too simple.

26
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,220
Then, what was it?

27
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,220
Quick, tell us Conan!

28
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,320
Hold your horses.

29
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,120
Try figuring out "Erase the mark of Okuho" first.

30
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,320
I get it.

31
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,920
That's a supermarket!

32
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,620
Huh? A supermarket?

33
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,220
You mean the leaflet that comes with the newspaper?

34
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,220
Why?

35
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,120
Pa often says,

36
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,220
"It's ma's job and up to her to do away with the reds."

37
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,420
That's why ma is always in a fix when shopping.

38
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,220
Wrong!

39
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,020
It's not "akaji" (Means red words), but "akashi" (Means mark).

40
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,120
It means something that certifies

41
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,820
or a seal for something.

42
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,820
If it means looking for a seal

43
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,120
it probably means scratching the silver off a lottery ticket with a coin.

44
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,920
But, it says erase the seal.

45
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,320
A postmark?

46
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,920
Don't tell me that the place is?

47
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,920
Yeah, Ran was saying that.

48
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,720
Ten years ago, the young boy called Shinichi realized that too...

49
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,820
"Ten years ago" -What? Okuho Post Office?

50
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,120
Then, did you decipher the code, Shinichi?

51
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,520
Yeah, half of it.

52
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,620
That word proof means mark, right?

53
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,520
And it's saying to erase that so...

54
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,720
I see! Postmark.

55
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,320
A postmark is stamped as proof that stamps

56
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,720
and postcards have been used

57
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,620
So, it's the post office!

58
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,720
But...

59
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,620
The people at the post office don't have strange voices.

60
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,720
No, they don't.

61
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,820
I don't know about the part after that yet

62
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,220
but if it's the post office, there's no harm going there.

63
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,920
Huh, why?

64
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,220
Because up to now, we figured out the place,

65
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,320
went there and looked for something red

66
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,320
then we found the next code.

67
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,620
It was a repetition of that, right?

68
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,520
The first red was a fire hydrant.

69
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,320
The next was a red alarm!

70
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,620
And if this third code is a post office...

71
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,820
I love red things.

72
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,520
I got it! It's the post box, a bright red one!

73
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,920
Right!

74
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,720
What? He took Ran with him again?

75
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,220
Shinichi?

76
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,620
Yes, they went out together with Mr. Agasa, our next door neighbor.

77
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,920
I'm sure they said they were going to Haido Harbor...

78
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,120
Haido Harbor?

79
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,720
That's where a murder was committed last night!

80
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,820
Well, there's nothing to worry about.

81
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,320
I hear that the case was solved this morning.

82
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,920
It's a holiday too.

83
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,920
It's better than staying inside and watching TV and playing games.

84
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,120
I think they should be able to go beyond the doors on a grand adventure.

85
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,020
Well, our bookworm son was indoors reading book after book.

86
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,220
So I'd like to thank your daughter for taking him out!

87
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,320
I just said that Shinichi is the one who took her out!

88
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,420
Come... Don't worry!

89
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,620
Geez...

90
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,820
I mean Yuki, you're always so easygoing and happy-go-lucky.

91
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,120
Oh, that's right.

92
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,920
There was a call from the metropolitan police for Yusaku.

93
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,220
They said to tell you, "Thank you for your cooperation."

94
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,220
"Thanks to you the jewelry was protected."

95
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,220
Oh, that case the other day.

96
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,520
That case about that thief, whatever his name was,

97
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,920
that Yusaku brushed away.

98
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,420
No... About that...

99
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,120
It's more like the thief made a perfect escape.

100
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,020
But, why did they call you, Eri?

101
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,820
Because they tried to call you a lot of times but they couldn't reach you.

102
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,320
Oh, I get it, Yuu.

103
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,920
You pulled out the telephone line again, didn't you?

104
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,020
Oh, well, I wanted to concentrate on my manuscript

105
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,620
because it's almost deadline.

106
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,320
At any rate, tell those children to come home right away

107
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,820
when you see them!

108
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,020
Are you leaving already?

109
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,220
I really don't have that much time.

110
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,420
I've got a court hearing coming up next week,

111
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,220
so I've got arrangements to make.

112
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,520
I see. It's your first court hearing.

113
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,520
Good luck!

114
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,620
Thank you.

115
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,920
Well, I may be beaten to a pulp because it's my first time.

116
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,120
If that happens please comfort me...

117
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,720
All right!

118
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:51,120
Didn't you have to make arrangements with somebody yourself too?

119
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,020
Remember, with the magician that you said you became a disciple of,

120
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,520
in order to act out your role.

121
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,720
I'd completely forgotten.

122
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,320
I promised to meet him in order to write my essay!

123
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,620
Was that today?

124
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,920
"Okuho Post Office" -Hey, Shinichi, the post box is here.

125
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,020
But there's nothing on it.

126
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,320
Strange, I was sure this is the place.

127
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,220
It seems that we have to decipher the phrase,

128
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,120
"Clench your teeth in solitaire with an unclear voice" first.

129
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,120
Hello! Here's the evening newspaper!

130
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,420
How're you doing?

131
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,620
As you can see, it's "kanko dori" (Means virtually no business).

132
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,920
"Kanko dori"?

133
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,820
What's "Kanko dori"?

134
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,720
It's "kakko" (Means cuckoo).

135
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,420
It's referring to the "gakko" (Means school)!

136
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,720
Let's go, Mouri!

137
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,520
What? Mouri?

138
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,820
Okay.

139
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,720
Hey, Shinichi!

140
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,320
Shinichi!

141
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,720
Geez. I told you before,

142
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,820
not to call me by my first name at school!

143
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,620
It's so embarrassing.

144
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,620
But, Shinichi's your name and you're Shinichi, right?

145
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,520
Call me Kudo!

146
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,920
I'll call you Mouri.

147
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,120
Well, we're not little kids anymore,

148
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,720
so please, okay, Mouri?

149
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,520
This is the only red thing near the school.

150
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,820
No, it doesn't seem like anything is pasted on anywhere.

151
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,820
Look carefully because there's got to be something.

152
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,920
It's just not up here.

153
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,120
There's something pasted over here!

154
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,620
I see, this is a code made for children to decipher.

155
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,820
That's why it's pasted on where we can reach it.

156
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,920
What's this?

157
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,520
It's all kanji characters.

158
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,720
You mean you can't read it either, Doc?

159
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,820
No, from everything we've seen so far,

160
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,320
I think that Beika at the top refers to Beika-cho, but...

161
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,920
I wonder if it's Chinese?

162
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,920
The word next to Beika is read as "Chuugoku" (Means China), right?

163
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,520
True, but we can't say for sure that it's Chinese just yet.

164
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,820
"Beikachu"

165
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,320
Beika Middle School...

166
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,520
Was there any Beika Middle School?

167
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,020
No, they have a university and high school

168
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,720
but no Beika Middle School.

169
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Besides, why is only the last word enclosed in a square?

170
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,720
True...

171
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,320
"East"

172
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,120
This looks familiar.

173
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,520
Ran!

174
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,420
Dad?

175
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,020
What're you doing here?

176
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,420
Oh, well, you see, there's a reason for this...

177
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:37,720
We're playing a game trying to decipher the code that Doc made.

178
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,320
Right, Doc?

179
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,720
Yeah, well, sort of.

180
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,820
-A code? -What brings you here, dad?

181
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,720
Well, it seems that the culprit we arrested this morning

182
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,220
used to work at the post office over there,

183
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,120
so I'm here to conduct interrogations with Inspector Megure!

184
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,920
Codes sure sound nostalgic, though!

185
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,620
I used to play spy games with my friends when I was a child too!

186
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,420
But, it's so hard that we can't figure it out.

187
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,420
Let's see, let me take a look!

188
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,020
Okay, but it's really difficult.

189
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,320
Gosh! What're you talking about?

190
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,320
We're police officers, you know?

191
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,620
A child's code like this is duck soup. One look and...

192
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,120
Hey, Mouri, can you figure it out?

193
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,120
No, I have no idea.

194
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,320
Well, at any rate,

195
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,220
it's a very well made code.

196
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,620
So you can't solve it after all.

197
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,420
Oh, Inspector!

198
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,820
Since it's been a while, how about playing a game of mahjong tonight?

199
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,020
Oh! I was thinking the same thing!

200
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,820
I don't know why but after looking at that code,

201
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,020
I suddenly felt this urge to play mahjong.

202
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,620
Oh, you too?

203
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,720
"East" -Mahjong?

204
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,120
Okay then, Ran, make sure you're home before dinner.

205
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,420
Okay!

206
00:11:06,524 --> 00:11:07,824
Shinichi,

207
00:11:07,824 --> 00:11:11,624
this is a game called mahjong that was introduced to Japan from China.

208
00:11:11,624 --> 00:11:13,824
Like in the card game seven bridge,

209
00:11:13,824 --> 00:11:15,724
you have to draw the tile you need yourself,

210
00:11:15,724 --> 00:11:18,324
or wait for someone to throw the tile you need to win a game.

211
00:11:18,324 --> 00:11:20,524
Only, unlike seven bridge,

212
00:11:20,524 --> 00:11:23,624
in mahjong, like poker, you can have a complete hand.

213
00:11:23,624 --> 00:11:24,924
This, which is either "Tonba" (Means east wind)

214
00:11:24,924 --> 00:11:26,224
or "Nanba" (Means south wind),

215
00:11:26,224 --> 00:11:30,124
is the rule that call "ba" (Means wind) to control the game.

216
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:32,724
What? Mahjong?

217
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:35,924
Are you saying that this code is related to mahjong?

218
00:11:35,924 --> 00:11:39,424
Yes, try thinking of it applying mahjong to it.

219
00:11:40,824 --> 00:11:43,024
It's true that the third character "Chu" (Means center)

220
00:11:43,024 --> 00:11:47,224
and the last character "East" are written on mahjong tiles,

221
00:11:47,224 --> 00:11:49,724
but the other characters are not.

222
00:11:49,724 --> 00:11:51,524
The first two characters "kome" and "hana" (Same sound as Beika)

223
00:11:51,524 --> 00:11:53,724
indicate the names of towns,

224
00:11:53,724 --> 00:11:55,724
therefore, Beika-cho is correct.

225
00:11:55,724 --> 00:11:58,124
The last character "East" that is drawn inside a square

226
00:11:58,124 --> 00:12:00,324
refers to the prevailing "ba" (Means wind) being played in mahjong.

227
00:12:00,324 --> 00:12:01,924
It's called "nanba" (Means south wind), "tonba" (Means east wind)

228
00:12:01,924 --> 00:12:03,424
and so forth, right?

229
00:12:03,424 --> 00:12:06,024
The above that "Kuni" and "Shi" refers to "Kokushi".

230
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:07,324
In other words, it is the name of a special winning hand,

231
00:12:07,324 --> 00:12:08,624
"Kokushimuso" which consists of the number 1 and 9 of all the suits

232
00:12:08,624 --> 00:12:10,724
plus all the honor and flower tiles.

233
00:12:10,724 --> 00:12:13,624
Then, what about the character "Chu" (Means center) that's above it?

234
00:12:13,624 --> 00:12:15,824
Since "Chu" (Means center) is one of the mahjong tiles,

235
00:12:15,824 --> 00:12:18,324
so it could be "dora" but rather, if you have a "kokushi" hand,

236
00:12:18,324 --> 00:12:20,724
you'd be "machi" for the tile of your choice...

237
00:12:20,724 --> 00:12:22,124
"Machi" (Means waiting)?

238
00:12:22,124 --> 00:12:25,324
So, if you put all three characters together?

239
00:12:25,324 --> 00:12:28,524
"Machi" (Means city), "yaku" (Means role),

240
00:12:28,524 --> 00:12:29,524
"ba" (Means place).

241
00:12:29,524 --> 00:12:31,424
I see, it's City hall!

242
00:12:33,124 --> 00:12:37,624
I see, but there is no city hall in Beika-cho,

243
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:40,324
it would be the ward office or the branch office!

244
00:12:40,324 --> 00:12:42,624
Okay, let's go there next then!

245
00:12:42,624 --> 00:12:46,224
"Beika Branch Office" -Nothing...

246
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,524
Strange.

247
00:12:47,524 --> 00:12:51,524
There's no red thing anywhere, Shinichi.

248
00:12:51,524 --> 00:12:54,424
Well, it's already sunset.

249
00:12:54,424 --> 00:12:57,124
Shinichi, why don't we go home today for now

250
00:12:57,124 --> 00:12:58,624
and continue again tomorrow?

251
00:12:58,624 --> 00:13:01,424
After all, tomorrow's also observed holiday.

252
00:13:01,424 --> 00:13:02,724
Observed holiday?

253
00:13:02,724 --> 00:13:05,224
I see! Today's a public holiday!

254
00:13:05,224 --> 00:13:08,824
What? What do you mean?

255
00:13:08,824 --> 00:13:11,624
There should be one standing on the roof of any government office.

256
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:20,624
"End" -The end?

257
00:13:24,624 --> 00:13:26,324
Is this English?

258
00:13:26,324 --> 00:13:30,024
It's just the alphabets W and S.

259
00:13:30,024 --> 00:13:33,624
But, I don't understand the meaning of this arrow at all.

260
00:13:33,624 --> 00:13:37,424
Since "the end", is written on it, could this be the last code?

261
00:13:37,424 --> 00:13:41,824
Hey, could the alphabets W and S have some sort of meaning as is?

262
00:13:41,824 --> 00:13:43,624
W and S...

263
00:13:43,624 --> 00:13:46,324
I see! It's direction!

264
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:49,124
S stands for south

265
00:13:49,124 --> 00:13:51,924
and W stands for west!

266
00:13:51,924 --> 00:13:55,924
Then does this arrow mean to go from south to west?

267
00:13:57,424 --> 00:14:02,324
Maybe it means to "look that way too" or simply, "look that way"?

268
00:14:02,324 --> 00:14:04,924
If so, south is this way.

269
00:14:04,924 --> 00:14:06,224
So, west is...

270
00:14:06,224 --> 00:14:07,324
This way.

271
00:14:14,124 --> 00:14:15,424
How beautiful!

272
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:20,124
I see. That's what it is.

273
00:14:20,124 --> 00:14:22,124
-What? -I know now.

274
00:14:22,124 --> 00:14:24,524
I've figured out who thought up this code.

275
00:14:24,524 --> 00:14:26,324
Who did?

276
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,024
My Dad.

277
00:14:28,024 --> 00:14:31,424
Dad asked one of his friends and used the code

278
00:14:31,424 --> 00:14:34,524
to bring us all the way here!

279
00:14:34,524 --> 00:14:37,324
Just to show us this sunset!

280
00:14:37,324 --> 00:14:38,724
I guess he did this

281
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:40,324
because I've been cooped up at home recently

282
00:14:40,324 --> 00:14:43,224
doing nothing but reading books.

283
00:14:43,224 --> 00:14:46,624
But, wasn't it just a coincidence that

284
00:14:46,624 --> 00:14:50,524
you met the man who gave you that code?

285
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:55,324
Sonoko said that she heard that a ghost appears in the library at school

286
00:14:55,324 --> 00:14:57,724
from a man who came to deliver new books.

287
00:14:57,724 --> 00:15:01,324
It's most likely that the man Sonoko was referring to was the man we saw.

288
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:02,424
I see.

289
00:15:02,424 --> 00:15:04,724
Telling Ran's friend about it

290
00:15:04,724 --> 00:15:06,824
would guarantee that you would hear about it too.

291
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:09,124
And since you can't resist mystery stories,

292
00:15:09,124 --> 00:15:11,224
you would be lured to go to school.

293
00:15:11,224 --> 00:15:12,724
Exactly!

294
00:15:12,724 --> 00:15:17,724
In other words, dad manipulated us just the way he wanted to!

295
00:15:17,724 --> 00:15:19,224
But it's nice

296
00:15:19,224 --> 00:15:21,924
that we got to see this beautiful sunset too.

297
00:15:21,924 --> 00:15:24,024
Oh, I hate to admit it,

298
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:27,324
but I totally agree, Ran.

299
00:15:27,324 --> 00:15:29,524
Oh, sorry, Mouri.

300
00:15:29,524 --> 00:15:31,324
Come off it! Ran's okay!

301
00:15:31,324 --> 00:15:33,124
I prefer you calling me Ran!

302
00:15:36,224 --> 00:15:38,924
Is it no good?

303
00:15:41,424 --> 00:15:42,624
If...

304
00:15:42,624 --> 00:15:45,324
if that's the way you want it then...

305
00:15:45,324 --> 00:15:47,024
I guess it's okay with me.

306
00:15:47,024 --> 00:15:48,224
Really?

307
00:15:48,224 --> 00:15:50,224
All right, Shinichi!

308
00:15:50,224 --> 00:15:52,024
Hey!

309
00:15:52,024 --> 00:15:53,624
Cut it out!

310
00:15:54,824 --> 00:15:57,924
I've got to thank your father!

311
00:15:57,924 --> 00:15:59,824
Oh, come on, if you're going to thank anybody,

312
00:15:59,824 --> 00:16:01,624
thank the man who gave us this code,

313
00:16:01,624 --> 00:16:04,124
that's still hanging around nearby.

314
00:16:04,124 --> 00:16:05,824
-What? -What?

315
00:16:05,824 --> 00:16:08,424
Is that guy somewhere nearby?

316
00:16:08,424 --> 00:16:11,624
Yeah. In order to make sure that we get to see this beautiful sunset,

317
00:16:11,624 --> 00:16:14,724
he's got to be glued to us, right?

318
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:18,424
Because he would have no idea how long it would take us to solve the code!

319
00:16:18,424 --> 00:16:21,824
I see! He would have to watch us right through,

320
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:25,124
then make it to the next place before us and get the next code ready,

321
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:26,624
adjusting the time and all.

322
00:16:26,624 --> 00:16:29,024
In other words, so long as he got us to come here,

323
00:16:29,024 --> 00:16:31,924
the codes that were found in between could've been anything!

324
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:35,824
But, maybe he's your father.

325
00:16:35,824 --> 00:16:38,724
No, dad would already have appeared saying something like,

326
00:16:38,724 --> 00:16:41,824
"What took you so long?"

327
00:16:41,824 --> 00:16:44,424
Hey, Mr. Yesterday Night!

328
00:16:44,424 --> 00:16:46,524
I know you're somewhere listening!

329
00:16:46,524 --> 00:16:49,324
I'll leave my opinion in this wallet that you gave me last night

330
00:16:49,324 --> 00:16:51,524
so come and get it!

331
00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:55,824
I'll hide it behind the book "Gentleman Burglar" that you were reading!

332
00:16:55,824 --> 00:16:57,924
Come for sure!

333
00:17:01,824 --> 00:17:04,724
That's why the message,

334
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:08,324
"Thank you, 1st grade, class A, Ran Mouri"

335
00:17:08,324 --> 00:17:10,024
is written on the paper inside the wallet!

336
00:17:11,123 --> 00:17:12,623
What a nice story.

337
00:17:12,623 --> 00:17:16,423
But the book that the wallet was found behind...

338
00:17:16,423 --> 00:17:19,024
Wasn't "Gentleman Burglar", was it?

339
00:17:19,024 --> 00:17:20,923
It can't be helped.

340
00:17:20,923 --> 00:17:22,824
Ten years have already gone by.

341
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:25,623
So, even the location of the book's been changed several times.

342
00:17:25,623 --> 00:17:30,024
I guess the man never came to get the book, though.

343
00:17:30,024 --> 00:17:32,224
I would think that he'd know where the original place the book was

344
00:17:32,224 --> 00:17:35,324
even if its location were to be changed, right?

345
00:17:35,324 --> 00:17:36,824
I guess so too.

346
00:17:36,824 --> 00:17:39,124
But, the man who thought up the code,

347
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,224
seems to have run out of everything at the end.

348
00:17:41,224 --> 00:17:42,824
Huh, why do you think so?

349
00:17:42,824 --> 00:17:46,324
Because although the riddles were interesting till part way,

350
00:17:46,324 --> 00:17:48,724
towards the end, all it had were the codes "S" and "W"

351
00:17:48,724 --> 00:17:50,724
and "look to the west."

352
00:17:50,724 --> 00:17:52,324
It kind of fizzled out at the end.

353
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:56,624
No.

354
00:17:56,624 --> 00:17:58,423
My deduction is wrong!

355
00:17:58,423 --> 00:18:00,724
If he wanted us to see the setting sun,

356
00:18:00,724 --> 00:18:02,423
"W" would've sufficed.

357
00:18:02,423 --> 00:18:05,423
The "S" and arrow wouldn't be necessary.

358
00:18:05,423 --> 00:18:07,024
Then, why the arrow?

359
00:18:07,024 --> 00:18:10,024
What are the "S", "W" and "arrow" supposed to be then?

360
00:18:10,024 --> 00:18:14,724
And why only at the end, there are symbols that indicate directions?

361
00:18:14,724 --> 00:18:17,324
Direction?

362
00:18:17,324 --> 00:18:18,524
Conan?

363
00:18:18,524 --> 00:18:20,824
I'm sure the first was...

364
00:18:20,824 --> 00:18:21,923
Harbor.

365
00:18:24,224 --> 00:18:26,624
"Toriya Castle Ruins" -Next, is the castle ruins...

366
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,724
The "flood gate" with the same name.

367
00:18:30,724 --> 00:18:33,324
A post office.

368
00:18:33,324 --> 00:18:34,724
A middle school.

369
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:39,024
"Beika Branch Office"

370
00:18:39,024 --> 00:18:42,324
City hall.

371
00:18:42,324 --> 00:18:44,423
They're symbols used on maps.

372
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,923
Come to think of it, the symbol for post office

373
00:18:47,923 --> 00:18:50,423
is the character "proof" inside a circle.

374
00:18:50,423 --> 00:18:52,824
So, "erase this" means...

375
00:18:52,824 --> 00:18:54,324
This?

376
00:18:55,524 --> 00:18:58,923
Only the symbol of the ward office was drawn vertically,

377
00:18:58,923 --> 00:19:03,324
so it must mean to change the position of this symbol like this...

378
00:19:03,324 --> 00:19:05,624
and as for the "S", "arrow" and "W",

379
00:19:05,624 --> 00:19:07,124
means from south to west.

380
00:19:07,124 --> 00:19:09,724
So, if this is placed this way.

381
00:19:14,824 --> 00:19:17,224
Oxhide?

382
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:19,324
Leather?

383
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,724
It's this wallet!

384
00:19:24,923 --> 00:19:26,423
We were wrong!

385
00:19:26,423 --> 00:19:29,524
I mistakenly thought that the one who made the code was nearby...

386
00:19:29,524 --> 00:19:34,224
I'll hide it behind the book "Gentleman Burglar" that you were reading!

387
00:19:34,224 --> 00:19:36,624
Come for sure!

388
00:19:36,624 --> 00:19:38,524
-Conan? -Hey?

389
00:19:38,524 --> 00:19:39,923
What's going on?

390
00:19:39,923 --> 00:19:42,324
I see. I get it.

391
00:19:42,324 --> 00:19:45,224
No kid could figure out a code like this.

392
00:19:45,224 --> 00:19:46,724
It was for dad.

393
00:19:46,724 --> 00:19:49,824
This code was made for dad to figure out to begin with.

394
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:51,224
If I couldn't figure it out,

395
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:54,423
the man figured I would beg dad to help me decipher it.

396
00:19:54,423 --> 00:19:57,423
That means, ten years ago...

397
00:19:57,423 --> 00:19:59,324
But, if so, how would what happened?

398
00:20:00,624 --> 00:20:03,324
"Ten years ago"

399
00:20:04,024 --> 00:20:07,124
Thank you so much for today.

400
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:09,124
Oh, did you catch cold?

401
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:13,624
No, maybe somebody's talking stink about me.

402
00:20:13,624 --> 00:20:15,923
Because after all, we magicians thrive on deceiving people,

403
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:19,423
in other words, we're swindlers.

404
00:20:19,423 --> 00:20:22,324
No way! You're not a swindler.

405
00:20:22,324 --> 00:20:26,423
But it's too bad Mr. Kudo couldn't come here.

406
00:20:26,423 --> 00:20:30,324
Rather, it would probably be more accurate to say I was relieved.

407
00:20:30,324 --> 00:20:34,524
To Kudo, magic is like constructing a building on sand.

408
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:37,124
He would see through the trick in an instant.

409
00:20:37,124 --> 00:20:38,724
My, how modest.

410
00:20:38,724 --> 00:20:42,224
You're the "seventh knight" that I have encountered,

411
00:20:42,224 --> 00:20:44,224
Toichi Kuroba of all people.

412
00:20:44,224 --> 00:20:47,524
I read that essay every time.

413
00:20:47,524 --> 00:20:48,923
My wife is a great fan.

414
00:20:50,923 --> 00:20:52,124
I'll give you this,

415
00:20:52,124 --> 00:20:53,423
because middle-aged lady is beautiful!

416
00:20:53,423 --> 00:20:56,124
Huh?

417
00:20:56,124 --> 00:20:58,824
Hey, Kaito! Stay still.

418
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,624
My, what a peppy young lad!

419
00:21:01,624 --> 00:21:03,524
But, sonny,

420
00:21:03,524 --> 00:21:07,923
the words beautiful and middle-aged lady don't match!

421
00:21:10,824 --> 00:21:12,724
Since I won't get to see Kudo,

422
00:21:12,724 --> 00:21:14,423
could you tell him to mail his reply to the friend of mine

423
00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:17,724
that I mentioned the other day, whose letter that will be delivered here,

424
00:21:17,724 --> 00:21:18,923
to this address.

425
00:21:18,923 --> 00:21:22,024
Oh, about the letter from a fan of Yusaku, right?

426
00:21:22,024 --> 00:21:23,423
When I told him about it,

427
00:21:23,423 --> 00:21:27,524
he said he already wrote an answer for me to take it to that person.

428
00:21:27,524 --> 00:21:31,124
But, his answer was not one you would call a letter or anything like that.

429
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,724
Wait!

430
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:36,824
Could it have been just one exclamation point?

431
00:21:36,824 --> 00:21:38,024
Am I right?

432
00:21:38,024 --> 00:21:39,324
What?

433
00:21:39,324 --> 00:21:41,024
Yes.

434
00:21:41,024 --> 00:21:43,024
But, how did you know?

435
00:21:44,124 --> 00:21:46,423
Just as would be expected of the one who gave me my name.

436
00:21:46,423 --> 00:21:47,524
Huh?

437
00:21:47,524 --> 00:21:50,824
That certain friend that I'm referring to

438
00:21:50,824 --> 00:21:54,824
also wrote a similar letter consisting of just one symbol.

439
00:21:57,724 --> 00:22:00,624
"Dear Yusaku Kudo".

440
00:22:00,624 --> 00:22:03,724
"Kaito No. 1412".

441
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:05,624
Come to think of it, the other day...

442
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,624
Did you know that Yusaku is the one who gave Thief Kid his name?

443
00:22:08,624 --> 00:22:10,324
He misread the scribble of the notes of a reporter

444
00:22:10,324 --> 00:22:14,724
and thought that the number 1412 that was written was "K-I-D."

445
00:22:15,824 --> 00:22:18,524
I'm your sibling.

446
00:22:18,524 --> 00:22:21,423
Rather, I should say, your younger brother.

447
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,524
That's why back then, he...

448
00:22:23,524 --> 00:22:26,724
Are you gonna be able to stop me next time?

449
00:22:26,724 --> 00:22:29,624
Yeah. Of course.

450
00:22:29,624 --> 00:22:31,724
But, what's the meaning of this?

451
00:22:31,724 --> 00:22:33,324
This question mark.

452
00:24:46,724 --> 00:24:49,224
Next Conan's Hint:

453
00:24:49,224 --> 00:24:51,024
"Baby talk"

454
00:24:51,024 --> 00:24:52,624
I'm dating in the next episode!

455
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,824
-With who? -Attorney Kisaki.

456
00:24:54,824 --> 00:24:55,923
-What? -What?
