1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:02,660
My heart tingles!

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,060
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,460
Trouble in a mountain full of maple trees with red leaves!

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,860
That man appears when Sonoko screams!

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,260
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,860
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,160
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,341 --> 00:02:01,241
Invited by Sonoko, we came to view the red maple leaves.

9
00:02:01,241 --> 00:02:04,341
However, Sonoko's real purpose

10
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:07,241
was to meet Makoto Kyogoku at the shooting site of

11
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:09,141
the popular drama "Red Maple Leaves in Winter"

12
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:12,041
after she ties a red handkerchief to the branch of a maple tree.

13
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:17,141
However, the trees of the mountain are full of red handkerchiefs.

14
00:02:18,341 --> 00:02:19,741
And there,

15
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:21,941
the AD of the drama that we had met,

16
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,841
Mr. Hozumi was murdered!

17
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:36,041
"Sonoko's Red Handkerchief (Part 2)"

18
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:40,041
Let's see.

19
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:45,341
Oh, it's you people who found the corpse?

20
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:51,441
Maybe you people did something to bring a curse upon you?

21
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:53,041
Just what do you mean by that?

22
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:58,541
Like turn a Buddhist altar upside down or kick a tombstone.

23
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,041
Goodness! Of course not!

24
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,841
Oh, I'm sorry. And do you people know him?

25
00:03:03,841 --> 00:03:06,541
No, we met him for the first time today.

26
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:07,941
He asked us to leave a message in his place,

27
00:03:07,941 --> 00:03:09,941
so we went to the Akagi Inn in front of the station.

28
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:12,441
Then when we came back here...

29
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:13,841
What kind of message?

30
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:17,841
He's an AD for the TV drama "Red Maple Leaves in Winter".

31
00:03:17,841 --> 00:03:18,941
"Red Maple Leaves in Winter"!

32
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:22,141
Oh, I know. Yes, I know it.

33
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:26,441
They have a re-run of it here now in Gunma on local TV.

34
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:28,941
It's a love romance story, right?

35
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:32,041
My grandma in the country recommended me to watch it.

36
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,841
It's "Red Maple Leaves in Winter"... got that?

37
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:38,341
I started watching the re-run, but I'm really hooked on it!

38
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:41,841
Every week on Saturday, from 9 pm to 10 pm,

39
00:03:41,841 --> 00:03:44,341
I'm glued in front of the TV.

40
00:03:44,341 --> 00:03:47,841
And today is Saturday, you see! So...

41
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:52,241
See! I secretly brought a portable TV with me.

42
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:55,641
Although I'm recording it at home, I just can't wait that long!

43
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:57,841
Oh...

44
00:03:57,841 --> 00:03:59,941
And what sort of message did you leave behind?

45
00:03:59,941 --> 00:04:03,941
Oh, right. A fan of the program wanted to know

46
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:07,441
where the tree for the drama that the red handkerchief was tied on to was

47
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:08,941
so he wanted us to leave a message to the fan

48
00:04:08,941 --> 00:04:11,141
who was staying at the Akagi Inn

49
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:14,541
that he found the tree and he would be waiting here.

50
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,041
Yes.

51
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,841
How lazy of him,

52
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:21,041
he should've given the message himself.

53
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,441
And did you get to meet that fan?

54
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:25,441
No, Sonoko just wrote the message in the message book

55
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:27,841
that was left at the inn.

56
00:04:27,841 --> 00:04:30,641
Right! "I found the tree that you were looking for."

57
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:33,141
"Please come to the place where the rock used

58
00:04:33,141 --> 00:04:34,741
"in the last scene of the drama is." That's what I wrote.

59
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:38,041
She signed his name, Hozumi, for some reason in katakana.

60
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,041
Yes.

61
00:04:40,141 --> 00:04:41,941
Why in katakana?

62
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:43,841
Beats me, that's how he told me to write it.

63
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:44,841
Right.

64
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:46,141
Hey!

65
00:04:46,141 --> 00:04:50,641
Maybe it was because that man used katakana often?

66
00:04:50,641 --> 00:04:55,341
Even on his pocket diary that we picked up on our way here,

67
00:04:55,341 --> 00:04:58,841
"Hozumi" was written in katakana!

68
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:02,841
We found it on the ground about 100 meters away from here.

69
00:05:02,841 --> 00:05:05,841
It was soiled with blood, so we rushed over here.

70
00:05:05,841 --> 00:05:08,241
Soiled with blood?

71
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:11,241
Then we found him lying there on the ground.

72
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:13,241
Oh...

73
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:16,241
Let's see, there was nothing really worth noticing in his pocket diary.

74
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:20,041
A blood stain on April 1st.

75
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,341
April 1st...

76
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:25,641
April 1st is April Fool's Day, April fool...

77
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:31,641
Hey...

78
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:35,841
-Yes? -Maybe that's a dying message?

79
00:05:35,841 --> 00:05:38,641
He's got blood on his finger.

80
00:05:38,641 --> 00:05:40,841
Officer Yamamura!

81
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:44,841
The estimated time of death of the victim is around 5 pm today.

82
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:46,841
We've found out that he was stabbed in the stomach once,

83
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:49,841
then stabbed in the chest too.

84
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:51,441
Anything that would identify the victim

85
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:54,541
seems to have been taken away by the killer.

86
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,241
No need to worry!

87
00:05:56,241 --> 00:05:59,141
Just call the production staff of "Red Maple Leaves in Winter"

88
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:01,741
"Hozumi" -and have them look for an AD named Hozumi

89
00:06:01,741 --> 00:06:03,641
and we'll be able to find him right away!

90
00:06:03,641 --> 00:06:08,141
Oh, and they seemed to have found an empty tent up ahead.

91
00:06:08,141 --> 00:06:11,641
An empty tent? Now that's quite suspicious.

92
00:06:11,641 --> 00:06:14,141
Please continue investigations!

93
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:15,341
Yes, sir!

94
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:16,541
-Hey. -What?

95
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:19,841
Didn't those officers say something else?

96
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:22,041
Or were there are lot of suspicious looking people?

97
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,741
No. All that was found was this tent.

98
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:28,541
More than the tent, wouldn't it be better if you went to Akagi Inn?

99
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,241
-What? -This is the place

100
00:06:30,241 --> 00:06:32,841
where the last scene of "Red Maple Leaves in Winter" was filmed,

101
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:35,641
so the fan that was waiting for him here is suspicious!

102
00:06:35,641 --> 00:06:38,341
Oh, so the last scene of the drama was filmed here.

103
00:06:38,341 --> 00:06:39,741
Yes, that's right!

104
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:41,041
In the last scene,

105
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:44,241
the young officer leans against the rock and hugs the young lady...

106
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:46,841
No...

107
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:49,041
I'm still in the middle of watching the drama,

108
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,741
so don't tell me!

109
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:53,341
"Akagi Inn"

110
00:06:53,341 --> 00:06:56,241
What? 53 people?

111
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:58,441
You mean there are that many people staying here?

112
00:06:58,441 --> 00:07:00,441
Yes, thank god!

113
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:02,541
Then how about the people who checked in this morning?

114
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,541
What?

115
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:04,741
Huh?

116
00:07:06,341 --> 00:07:07,841
Please check!

117
00:07:07,841 --> 00:07:10,841
Remember? The man said that he got a mail from that fan

118
00:07:10,841 --> 00:07:14,841
saying that he checked in at this inn this morning!

119
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:16,341
Yes.

120
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:17,841
And how about it?

121
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:21,341
Oh. These are the three people

122
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,541
who checked in this morning.

123
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,941
"Isamu Okuma, Tatsuzo Watanuki, Hans Buckly"

124
00:07:25,941 --> 00:07:28,941
Then could you ask

125
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:31,741
those three people to come here?

126
00:07:31,741 --> 00:07:34,741
"Isamu Okuma (25)" -What is it, bummers?

127
00:07:34,741 --> 00:07:37,941
"Tatsuzo Watanuki (63)" -The police here this late?

128
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:40,541
"Hans Buckly (41)" -What do you want?

129
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,941
Well...

130
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:43,641
What were you three doing

131
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:48,141
and where were you at around 5 pm today?

132
00:07:48,141 --> 00:07:49,541
I was sleeping in my room.

133
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,041
I was taking a bath.

134
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,341
I was taking a walk nearby.

135
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:55,141
Is there anyone who can confirm that?

136
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,141
No!

137
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:58,041
I was taking a bath in my room so...

138
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,141
I didn't run into anyone.

139
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:02,441
A young man with a foul mouth,

140
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,441
an aged man with glasses,

141
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:07,941
and a non-Japanese man who speaks broken Japanese.

142
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:10,741
Hey, Ran! Don't you think that guy with the pierced nose

143
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,641
-looks suspicious? -What?

144
00:08:12,641 --> 00:08:14,741
Maybe he asked the victim to write his name in katakana

145
00:08:14,741 --> 00:08:18,041
because he can't read kanji.

146
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,141
If so, then that aged man is also suspicious.

147
00:08:20,141 --> 00:08:22,241
Maybe he wanted the name written in katakana

148
00:08:22,241 --> 00:08:24,241
because kanji is too cluttered together and hard to see.

149
00:08:24,241 --> 00:08:26,241
Oh, wait!

150
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:27,841
It could be that non-Japanese man.

151
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:32,941
It's likely that he can read hiragana and katakana but not kanji.

152
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:35,141
Then who of you here

153
00:08:35,141 --> 00:08:37,941
know the drama called "Red Maple Leaves in Winter?"

154
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:39,341
What the heck is that?

155
00:08:39,341 --> 00:08:41,541
I've never heard of it.

156
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,441
Don't red maple leaves wither in winter?

157
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:48,741
Oh, maybe you're playing dumb despite knowing the program.

158
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:50,241
But no use!

159
00:08:50,241 --> 00:08:52,441
Because if you're a fan of the drama, it'll show on your face

160
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:54,241
as soon as the opening comes on!

161
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:55,841
So, watch!

162
00:08:55,841 --> 00:08:57,241
Here's "Red Maple Leaves in Winter!"

163
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:59,141
So, the time has finally come

164
00:08:59,141 --> 00:09:01,441
for the Europe Karate Championship Tournament.

165
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:04,841
-Episode eight of "Red Maple Leaves in Winter!" -What? No?

166
00:09:04,841 --> 00:09:06,841
-will not be aired tonight.-A special program?

167
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:08,241
You want us to watch karate?

168
00:09:08,241 --> 00:09:10,941
-But the center of attraction of this tournament is -Oh, well, no...

169
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:13,041
-none other than the man, Makoto Kyogoku! -Yes...

170
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,041
-What? -What?

171
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,941
Let's take a look at his introductory video tape.

172
00:09:16,941 --> 00:09:18,141
Lend it to me!

173
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,941
He just made 18 years of age but holds a 400 times straight win record!

174
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:24,241
The powerful fisted Makoto Kyogoku, apart from all others.

175
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:26,041
Makoto!

176
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,641
But Sonoko,

177
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:30,541
didn't Kyogoku tell you about the tournament?

178
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,841
Well,

179
00:09:31,841 --> 00:09:33,441
he said that he'd rather commit "seppuku"

180
00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:37,541
than to have me watch him lose, and wouldn't tell me!

181
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,341
"Seppuku" (Japanese ritual suicide by disembowelment)?

182
00:09:39,341 --> 00:09:42,041
I mean, he'd never lose.

183
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:45,841
Officer Yamamura! I contacted the movie production company.

184
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:48,541
But was told that no one by the name of "Hozumi" works there.

185
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:49,641
What?

186
00:09:49,641 --> 00:09:52,841
Here's the copy of the namelist that they sent us.

187
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:54,541
Copy of the namelist.

188
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:58,341
Are you sure this namelist is correct?

189
00:09:58,341 --> 00:10:00,541
It seems that the dates are mixed up.

190
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,341
See, at the very end of the line.

191
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:03,741
True.

192
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:07,041
I see! The date!

193
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:10,741
But if we're to believe what the production company says,

194
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:12,841
it would mean that the victim was lying.

195
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:13,941
Lying?

196
00:10:13,941 --> 00:10:14,941
Come to think of it,

197
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:17,941
"April Fool" -April Fool is a day when it's okay to lie.

198
00:10:17,941 --> 00:10:21,841
Which means that the killer is lying!

199
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:25,741
Oh, Officer Yamamura, the one who's lying is the victim.

200
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:27,041
-Hey, Sonoko. -I wonder

201
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,841
-Goodness, she's not listening to me. -when is Makoto coming on.

202
00:10:29,841 --> 00:10:31,341
Hey, Conan...

203
00:10:31,341 --> 00:10:34,041
Conan...

204
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:39,941
If my deduction is correct,

205
00:10:39,941 --> 00:10:42,041
the killer still hasn't found it!

206
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:51,541
Found it! It's this tree!

207
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,541
The soil is still soft.

208
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,741
As I thought, Mr. Hozumi was digging here

209
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,641
before he met the killer.

210
00:11:04,641 --> 00:11:06,241
I see.

211
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:07,841
The red maple leaves in winter

212
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:10,141
was simply to mark this grave.

213
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,941
"Akagi Inn" -Hey, Conan?

214
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:20,741
Where are you now? I'm searching for you!

215
00:11:20,741 --> 00:11:22,141
You can go on home without me!

216
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:23,241
Go home without you?

217
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:25,041
Yes. I can't make up my mind

218
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,041
on what souvenir to get for Genta and the others.

219
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:31,341
Don't worry because Dr. Agasa is coming to pick me up!

220
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:34,741
Hey! What do you mean don't worry about you?

221
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:38,241
By the way, are the three guests still there?

222
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:41,341
All three of them are still here.

223
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:44,041
But they're going to continue interrogation again some other day

224
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,041
because it's already late tonight,

225
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,241
Officer Yamamura said so a while ago.

226
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:51,841
I see. Oh, will you put Sonoko on the line?

227
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:52,841
Huh?

228
00:11:52,841 --> 00:11:54,341
Conan wants to talk to you.

229
00:11:54,341 --> 00:11:56,541
He wants to talk to me?

230
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,141
Yes.

231
00:11:58,141 --> 00:11:59,541
Hello?

232
00:12:00,741 --> 00:12:02,741
Yes, I remember.

233
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:07,041
You mean the tree that I thought my handkerchief was stuck on, right?

234
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:10,241
It was located way in the foreground of the forest

235
00:12:10,241 --> 00:12:12,441
where the rock that appeared in the last scene of the drama is.

236
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:15,741
It was about ten minutes away.

237
00:12:15,741 --> 00:12:19,841
That tree may have also been used for the drama?

238
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:22,541
Yes, because the handkerchief was also there

239
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,441
and the branch also looked very similar too.

240
00:12:25,441 --> 00:12:29,341
Don't be silly! The handkerchiefs on that tree are those of the fans!

241
00:12:29,341 --> 00:12:31,741
The only tree that was used in the drama is the maple tree

242
00:12:31,741 --> 00:12:33,241
with red leaves near the rock!

243
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:35,341
It would be too confusing if there are two or three

244
00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:37,041
of the same kind of trees around!

245
00:12:38,141 --> 00:12:40,241
That's true. Thank you, Sonoko.

246
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:42,141
Oh, hey.

247
00:12:42,141 --> 00:12:44,341
Oh, he hung up on his side!

248
00:12:44,341 --> 00:12:46,141
No! You mean he hung up?

249
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,810
Ran?

250
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,510
Yes, that's right.

251
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,910
I was just about to go pick Conan up.

252
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,910
I discussed things over with Conan a while ago

253
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,510
and agreed to ride your car with Sonoko.

254
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,610
What? No way!

255
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,310
I called our car to come pick us up already.

256
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,210
So, will you tell me where you're meeting Conan?

257
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,610
It seems that Conan's cell phone battery went dead

258
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,610
in the middle of our conversation.

259
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:23,710
Strange, Shinichi is supposed to be riding with me alone.

260
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,310
The entrance of the mountain path

261
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,210
that was used in the drama called, "Red Maple Leaves in Winter".

262
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,310
I see, thank you, Dr. Agasa!

263
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,410
Yeah.

264
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:51,010
You should act happier.

265
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,310
You're meeting each other after a long while, aren't you?

266
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,510
Mr. Tatsuzo Watanuki?

267
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:04,610
I don't know who the skeleton is,

268
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,310
but you're the one who buried it there.

269
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,510
And you tied a red handkerchief on the branch,

270
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,610
so that you could move the body at anytime if something came up.

271
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,910
You decided on a red handkerchief because you figured that

272
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,810
it would blend in with the red leaves and be inconspicuous.

273
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,510
After all, in the past,

274
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,710
people used to come here only during the autumn season.

275
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,510
But ever since a drama called "Red Maple Leaves of Winter" was aired

276
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,610
using a red handkerchief,

277
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,310
regardless of the time of season, fans began swarming to this mountain

278
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,710
and tying red handkerchiefs to the branches of the maple trees

279
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,510
one after the other as was done in the drama.

280
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,610
Therefore, you ended up not knowing

281
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,910
which tree you buried the body under.

282
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,310
Afraid that someone would eventually find the body if left as is.

283
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,310
You found out that the person who originally found the tree

284
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,310
was Mr. Hozumi, a production staff of the drama,

285
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,810
so you paid him to find the tree!

286
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,910
Just as expected, Mr. Hozumi found the tree.

287
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,510
You went to the place he specified he would see you

288
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,410
in the forest used in the last scene of the drama,

289
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,610
you paid him after he told you where the tree was,

290
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,010
everything was to end well.

291
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,110
However, before he met you,

292
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,810
Mr. Hozumi came across the bones.

293
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:17,810
He dug the root of this tree, like you just did just now.

294
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:23,010
Mr. Hozumi then decided to blackmail you about the bones.

295
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,010
However, on the contrary,

296
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,410
he was stabbed to death by you instead.

297
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,910
You killed him before asking him where the tree was

298
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,210
because if he had already found the skeleton of the body,

299
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,210
all you had to do was look for a maple tree

300
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:42,210
where the soil is soft near the root of the tree.

301
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:45,410
But you couldn't find it at the place of the last scene of the drama.

302
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,710
It's most natural

303
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:51,110
because the tree in question was here, more than 500 meters away.

304
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,210
Well, if you presume that it would be confusing

305
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,310
if two red handkerchiefs are in view when shooting the drama,

306
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,610
so he chose a place some distance away,

307
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:00,810
it's easy to figure out that it's this tree.

308
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,510
Besides, the staff would never remove the handkerchief

309
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,610
that brought so much attention just because it's in the way of filming.

310
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,610
Boy, you seem to be pretty bright

311
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:16,110
but what were you planning to do if I didn't show up?

312
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,310
Just call the police!

313
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:22,910
Because it was written in Mr. Hozumi's pocket diary that you're the killer.

314
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,110
It can't be. All that was found in that pocket diary

315
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,810
was a blood stain on the April 1st page.

316
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,010
Right! April 1st.

317
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,110
In the old days, people used to remove the cotton

318
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,610
from their winter kimonos to change them to summer wear.

319
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,910
"April 1st" -Therefore, in the past,

320
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:41,310
April 1st used to be read as "Watanuki", meaning removing cotton!

321
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,110
In other words, April 1st stands for you, Mr. Watanuki.

322
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:48,310
It's none other than your name!

323
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,810
By the way, Mr. Hozumi wanted his name written in katakana

324
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,110
because his last name could be read "August 1st" as well as Hozumi.

325
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,310
The origin of the name came from the fact that on August 1st,

326
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,310
people used to reap the ears of rice and offer it to God.

327
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,310
He probably thought that writing "August 1st" would not be read "Hozumi",

328
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,410
so he went out of the way and asked his name to be written in katakana.

329
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,810
The fact that Mr. Hozumi's pocket diary with your name written in

330
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:14,010
was found some distance away from where he was lying on the ground.

331
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:18,110
Shows that you saw him writing in the diary, went back to him,

332
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,910
stabbed him in the chest, striking the final blow,

333
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,810
stole his pocket diary and fled

334
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,010
but unable to make out what "April 1st" stood

335
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,310
for you decided to throw it away on the way.

336
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,910
Who the heck... who the heck are you?

337
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,010
Conan Edogawa!

338
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,510
A detective!

339
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,410
Then tell me, detective brat,

340
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:44,410
why I left and fled leaving his body?

341
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,110
You figured it was already dark so no one would come

342
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,910
and was deciding to go back after getting prepared

343
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,410
and get rid of his body at around midnight, right?

344
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,810
Yeah, that's right.

345
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,110
Along with these guys.

346
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,910
40, rather, 50 people?

347
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,210
Who're these guys?

348
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:06,310
They were soldiers that I summoned to search this tree

349
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,110
but I guess there are too many of them to get rid of just one brat.

350
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,610
Conan!

351
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,610
Ran?

352
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,610
Conan!

353
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,410
Conan!

354
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,610
Come on, Ran! I think he'll do well on his own, don't you think?

355
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,310
-That glasses kid will be okay! -What're you talking about? No way!

356
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,710
I'm sure that curiosity got the best of him again,

357
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:29,010
and he's up to doing something dangerous!

358
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,010
So, it's finally time

359
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,110
-for contestant Kyogoku's first match! -Hey, Sonoko, are you listening?

360
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:35,610
Oh, Kyogoku didn't compete yet?

361
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:40,310
No! I don't know why but Makoto's being seeded one after the other!

362
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,810
What? Who is it?

363
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,010
Beats me...

364
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,610
Ran! Sonoko!

365
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,810
Conan!

366
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,610
Glasses kid?

367
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:55,410
Hey...

368
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,310
Who on earth are these people?

369
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,510
Beats me.

370
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,810
-Conan. -Glasses kid, who are these people?

371
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,510
They're not your friends, are they?

372
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:12,710
Well... I guess we need to dig three grave holes now.

373
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,710
Grave?

374
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,810
I'm sure they are not good people.

375
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,810
Ran, behind you!

376
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,010
Ran!

377
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,610
There are just too many of them.

378
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,410
Are you all right? Ran...

379
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,310
Only if Makoto were here.

380
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,410
Darn!

381
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,010
Makoto, please help us!

382
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:47,110
Makoto!

383
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,610
What's going on?

384
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:56,110
Something is beyond on the other side?

385
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:59,010
Makoto Kyogoku is not at the tournament?

386
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,410
His whereabouts have been unknown since three days ago?

387
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,510
Then where on earth is he?

388
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,710
What?

389
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,110
Makoto?

390
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,710
How come...

391
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,810
Oh, well, you see...

392
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,110
In front of you!

393
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,310
-Well, you see... -Behind you!

394
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:34,610
Darn. You brat.

395
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,610
How dare you make light of me?

396
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,610
A death battle continued for about 10 minutes

397
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:51,210
until Officer Yamamura who we called arrived at the scene.

398
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,610
After everything was settled, what we found out was that

399
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,210
those men are members of a gang called Deisankai

400
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,710
and the old man called Watanuki is the leader of the gang.

401
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,910
The skeleton that was found was also the leader of that gang.

402
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,110
In other words, this seems to have been a fight

403
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,810
for who was to succeed the position of leader of the gang.

404
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,710
He seem to have killed the leader secretly and buried him here.

405
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,410
So, even if he manages to get out of prison,

406
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:14,210
he would have to face the gang.

407
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:17,110
Well, that's if he can get out.

408
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:47,010
It's so much like a hero

409
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:50,110
to have felt that Sonoko was in danger and come rushing over.

410
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,810
I went to the place that Ms. Sonoko had written in her mail

411
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:55,110
and was waiting there, but...

412
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,510
Then you found out where the place was

413
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,910
by watching the drama "Red Maple Leaves in Winter"?

414
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:02,710
The fact is I was recording it for my sister on the video

415
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,310
but although it's embarrassing, I got hooked on it myself.

416
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:09,410
But I wrote in my mail that I would be waiting on the "Eve of Eve".

417
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,610
I couldn't understand what you meant by that.

418
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:12,910
What?

419
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:16,210
It means the day before Christmas Eve.

420
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,810
I figured all I had to do was ask you and feel embarrassed for a second.

421
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:21,010
But I didn't want to lose my pride as a man doing so.

422
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:24,010
That's why I set a tent up and waited over there.

423
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,210
Till that day came.

424
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,210
Was I a bit reckless?

425
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,110
No, not at all.

426
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,410
He's really a free soul.

427
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,510
But how wonderful to come all this way just for Sonoko

428
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,110
despite having to put a stop to your successive wins.

429
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,410
Yes, I'm overwhelmed and touched.

430
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,810
So, the best four contestants of

431
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,910
the European Karate Championship game has lined up!

432
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:48,910
It's really disappointing that contestant Makoto Kyogoku is not here!

433
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,610
I'm sorry, but please speed over to Narita Airport.

434
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,610
Don't tell me you're going back to the tournament grounds!

435
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:57,410
Yes, I want to compete with the winner and determine who's stronger.

436
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,910
Gosh, he still wants to fight.

437
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,360
Next Conan's Hint:

438
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
"Moving house"

439
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,060
The next episode is about a skinny man.

440
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,200
The abominable skeleton.

441
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,820
-You mean square. -Oh, really?
