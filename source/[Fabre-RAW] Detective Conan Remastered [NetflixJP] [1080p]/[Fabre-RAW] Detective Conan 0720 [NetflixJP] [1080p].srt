1
00:00:37,556 --> 00:00:39,256
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

2
00:00:39,256 --> 00:00:41,156
are slashed by the light of deduction.

3
00:00:41,156 --> 00:00:43,056
The stage of this episode is at Aso in Kumamoto, the Land of Fire.

4
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:44,956
Search for the secret data.

5
00:00:44,956 --> 00:00:46,556
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:46,556 --> 00:00:48,556
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:48,556 --> 00:00:50,956
His name is Detective Conan!

00:02:20,115 --> 00:02:25,915
"Fire and Water Mystery Tour (Aso Edition)"

9
00:02:26,415 --> 00:02:27,515
"Kumamoto Station"

10
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:29,515
Accompanied by Ran and Pops Kogoro,

11
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:32,131
we, the members of the Youth Detective Squad,

12
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:35,015
came on a sightseeing tour to Kumamoto.

13
00:02:36,915 --> 00:02:40,139
Kumamoto is blessed by a rich water source

14
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:41,715
and is Japan's number one clear underground water city.

15
00:02:41,715 --> 00:02:43,115
"Kumamoto Shintoshin Plaza"

16
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:44,143
What a surprise

17
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:47,815
that mineral water comes out from an ordinary faucet.

18
00:02:50,415 --> 00:02:52,151
-It's delicious. -Yeah!

19
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:58,157
But Kumamoto is known after all for...

20
00:02:58,157 --> 00:03:00,815
Red bull steak and rare horse meat,

21
00:03:00,815 --> 00:03:02,915
and spicy lotus root!

22
00:03:02,915 --> 00:03:05,215
They go deliciously well with Kuma Shochu.

23
00:03:05,215 --> 00:03:07,815
Drinking it in one gulp.

24
00:03:07,815 --> 00:03:10,169
No, I wasn't referring to food.

25
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:14,173
I would like a healthy Taipien.

26
00:03:16,415 --> 00:03:18,915
When it comes to Kumamoto...

27
00:03:18,915 --> 00:03:21,115
Look! Conan!

28
00:03:21,115 --> 00:03:23,715
It's Mt. Aso!

29
00:03:23,715 --> 00:03:27,415
Right. As well as being the city of water,

30
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,515
Kumamoto is known as the land of fire.

31
00:03:29,515 --> 00:03:31,715
"Aso Volcano Museum" -Before going to see the crater,

32
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:34,915
let's study about the volcano here.

33
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:36,615
What?

34
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,915
Fantastic!

35
00:03:41,915 --> 00:03:45,515
Well, Genta's the most delighted here.

36
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:46,915
Mt. Aso is in fact what most people call it by,

37
00:03:46,915 --> 00:03:49,815
but it is actually composed of 5 mountains:

38
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:51,215
Takadake,

39
00:03:51,215 --> 00:03:52,815
Nakadake,

40
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,615
Nekodake,

41
00:03:54,615 --> 00:03:56,215
Eboshidake,

42
00:03:56,415 --> 00:03:58,015
Kishimadake,

43
00:03:58,015 --> 00:04:01,915
and it is formally called "Aso Gogaku".

44
00:04:01,915 --> 00:04:05,215
The place where the volcanic crater we're headed for now

45
00:04:05,215 --> 00:04:07,015
is Nakadake, right?

46
00:04:12,615 --> 00:04:14,233
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:15,915
Are you okay, sonny?

48
00:04:15,915 --> 00:04:17,615
Yep, I'm fine.

49
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:20,239
Besides, don't call me sonny.

50
00:04:20,415 --> 00:04:21,815
I'm Justin.

51
00:04:21,815 --> 00:04:24,243
Justin Takamori.

52
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:26,515
Justin?

53
00:04:26,515 --> 00:04:28,247
Cute.

54
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:30,249
Yeah, a lot of people tell me that.

55
00:04:31,515 --> 00:04:35,015
But you're cuter than me, miss.

56
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:37,115
Huh?

57
00:04:37,115 --> 00:04:39,415
That smile, that wink...

58
00:04:39,415 --> 00:04:43,415
He knows that doing that would make any lady fall for him.

59
00:04:43,415 --> 00:04:46,265
A rival appears.

60
00:04:46,265 --> 00:04:49,615
But you're number 2, miss.

61
00:04:49,615 --> 00:04:51,515
Then, who's number 1?

62
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:53,915
Of course, it's mommy!

63
00:04:53,915 --> 00:04:55,315
Justin!

64
00:04:55,315 --> 00:04:59,015
I told you not to go off on your own, didn't I?

65
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:03,615
I'm sorry, mommy.

66
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:08,287
Right! I'll show you guys something good.

67
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:09,715
Something good?

68
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:15,415
Wow, super!

69
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,015
You sure collected a lot of stamps.

70
00:05:18,015 --> 00:05:20,299
You can say that again!

71
00:05:20,515 --> 00:05:22,301
He's still a kid doing stuff like that.

72
00:05:22,515 --> 00:05:25,515
Gosh. What an obnoxious brat.

73
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:26,915
Did you say something?

74
00:05:26,915 --> 00:05:28,307
Not really.

75
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:29,915
You're the brat.

76
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:33,015
My, he sure is a cute little child.

77
00:05:33,015 --> 00:05:34,915
Thank you.

78
00:05:34,915 --> 00:05:36,315
Forgive me for forgetting to introduce myself.

79
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:39,515
I'm a detective, you see.

80
00:05:39,515 --> 00:05:43,215
My name card...

81
00:05:43,215 --> 00:05:44,323
Huh?

82
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:47,615
My shiny name card... Where is it?

83
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:50,015
Let's get going, shall we, Justin?

84
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:52,015
Say bye to your friends.

85
00:05:52,015 --> 00:05:54,333
Okay, mommy.

86
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,015
See you.

87
00:05:59,815 --> 00:06:02,915
Found it! This is who I am...

88
00:06:02,915 --> 00:06:06,615
Huh?

89
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:09,515
What're you doing, Dad? We're going.

90
00:06:09,515 --> 00:06:10,349
Okay.

91
00:06:10,515 --> 00:06:12,715
"Aso Ropeway Station" -Next, we're finally

92
00:06:12,715 --> 00:06:14,353
going to the crater!

93
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:30,369
This is something!

94
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:32,815
It's really impressive!

95
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:42,915
We don't get to see this crater at all times, you know.

96
00:06:42,915 --> 00:06:44,715
We're lucky.

97
00:06:44,715 --> 00:06:46,385
Huh? Why?

98
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:50,015
It's because Nakadake here is an active volcano.

99
00:06:50,015 --> 00:06:53,115
It emits poisonous gas sometimes,

100
00:06:53,115 --> 00:06:56,715
so there are times when this place is off limits.

101
00:06:56,715 --> 00:06:57,915
True.

102
00:06:57,915 --> 00:07:01,215
It was worth coming, being that we got to see this!

103
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:06,115
"Aso Cuddly Dominion" -There are many animals here!

104
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:08,115
-Let's go! -Yeah!

105
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:12,115
It's a stuffed Kumamon doll!

106
00:07:12,115 --> 00:07:14,115
May I go take a look?

107
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:17,515
But if we buy things first, we're going to have to carry them

108
00:07:17,515 --> 00:07:18,815
so let's take a look on our way back.

109
00:07:18,815 --> 00:07:20,715
I see.

110
00:07:20,715 --> 00:07:22,115
Okay!

111
00:07:22,115 --> 00:07:24,815
Mr. Bear...

112
00:07:24,815 --> 00:07:28,427
So she says, but she'll probably forget to buy it anyway.

113
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:34,433
Look, look!

114
00:07:34,615 --> 00:07:37,215
It's begging for food!

115
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:46,015
Go! Hurry up!

116
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:31,115
Boy did I eat!

117
00:08:31,115 --> 00:08:33,515
He can really eat, can't he?

118
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,495
Huh?

119
00:08:41,115 --> 00:08:43,515
The man just left Kumamon behind

120
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:45,315
and took the bag with him.

121
00:08:45,315 --> 00:08:49,415
Okay! Nab him as soon as the crowd subsides!

122
00:08:49,415 --> 00:08:51,615
-Be really careful... -Please wait!

123
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,415
-There's a child. -What?

124
00:08:53,415 --> 00:08:55,915
Sir!

125
00:08:55,915 --> 00:08:57,915
This is yours, isn't it, sir?

126
00:08:57,915 --> 00:08:59,715
Darn it!

127
00:08:59,715 --> 00:09:01,415
Hold it!

128
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:09,015
Ayumi!

129
00:09:14,315 --> 00:09:16,015
I'm not letting you get away!

130
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:27,115
Precocious brat?

131
00:09:27,115 --> 00:09:29,115
Outta the way!

132
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:30,115
Watch out!

133
00:09:30,115 --> 00:09:31,615
Mommy!

134
00:09:36,115 --> 00:09:38,815
Justin...

135
00:09:40,015 --> 00:09:42,115
Hold it!

136
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:52,115
Hey, are you okay?

137
00:09:52,115 --> 00:09:53,815
It's you again?

138
00:09:53,815 --> 00:09:57,615
Justin, did you hurt yourself?

139
00:09:57,615 --> 00:09:59,115
I'm fine!

140
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:01,015
The ground being grassy saved me.

141
00:10:01,015 --> 00:10:03,115
What a relief.

142
00:10:06,915 --> 00:10:09,215
Where's my Kumamon?

143
00:10:09,215 --> 00:10:12,591
Without it, my company is...

144
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:15,315
My company is finished.

145
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:16,595
What on earth happened?

146
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:18,315
I wonder.

147
00:10:18,315 --> 00:10:20,599
There! Now, you're okay!

148
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:21,715
Yep.

149
00:10:21,715 --> 00:10:23,915
What on earth should I do?

150
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,605
I'll have to get it back, or else...

151
00:10:26,815 --> 00:10:29,515
What on earth is going on?

152
00:10:29,515 --> 00:10:32,315
Are you that child's guardian?

153
00:10:32,315 --> 00:10:34,613
Yes, I guess you could say so.

154
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:39,415
Let me introduce myself. This is my business card.

155
00:10:39,415 --> 00:10:41,515
Kogoro Mouri.

156
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,623
You mean you're that great detective.

157
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:45,815
The way I see it,

158
00:10:45,815 --> 00:10:49,215
it seems that we've interfered with your investigation.

159
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:53,615
If it's okay with you, won't you tell me what happened?

160
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:02,219
The thing is 2 days ago,

161
00:11:02,219 --> 00:11:06,645
my company Kumamon Foods was burglarized.

162
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:08,419
Kumamon Foods?

163
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:10,219
Kumamon...

164
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:15,719
I'm Monkichi Kumada, "Kumamon" in short.

165
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:19,019
I've been called by this nickname ever since I was a kid!

166
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:22,661
I see. So, you're the original "Kumamon".

167
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:26,119
President, did you call for me?

168
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,019
You're late, Inoue!

169
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,319
I'm sorry.

170
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:32,019
But why are the police here?

171
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:33,619
I called them!

172
00:11:33,619 --> 00:11:35,919
Never mind that. Just explain to him

173
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,419
the circumstances of when the burglar broke in.

174
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:42,419
Yes, sir. When I arrived at the office in the morning,

175
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:44,683
I found that the lock of the door had been broken.

176
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:47,419
So, I rushed to check out the office,

177
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:49,619
but it didn't look particularly messed up or anything.

178
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:51,519
So I was sort of relieved.

179
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,719
But my stuffed doll Kumamon was missing.

180
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:59,019
Kumamon's Kumamon.

181
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,699
Not only that,

182
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:04,419
but I had this bad premonition, so I looked inside the desk,

183
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:06,419
and found that the memory stick with

184
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:10,319
confidential information of the company inside it was gone.

185
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:12,711
The data was of a completely new candy

186
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:14,713
that our company originally developed,

187
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:17,419
having a new sensation and new taste.

188
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:20,219
It was still pending patent.

189
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:22,419
A small and minor business like ours

190
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:24,519
have to keep on making new items,

191
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:27,319
and make ends meet by attaining patents for them.

192
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:31,219
But if that development data is stolen by another company...

193
00:12:31,219 --> 00:12:34,733
like Higo Foods, a major company in this business,

194
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:37,419
we're finished!

195
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:39,419
And anything from the culprit?

196
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:40,739
Yeah.

197
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:44,119
The following day, we got a call from the culprit.

198
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:48,019
I want you to buy the USB memory stick

199
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:50,419
with vital data in it for 10,000,000 yen.

200
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:52,119
If you report this to the police,

201
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:54,753
the negotiation is off, understand?

202
00:12:55,819 --> 00:12:58,757
And today was that day of the deal, right?

203
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:03,219
Yes. The culprit told us that he would put the USB memory stick

204
00:13:03,219 --> 00:13:05,619
with confidential data in it inside the Kumamon doll

205
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:09,319
and exchange it for the bag with 10,000,000 yen in it.

206
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:12,519
Why did the culprit do something so roundabout?

207
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:15,519
He probably just wanted to spite me.

208
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,419
What shall we do, president?

209
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:20,519
The culprit said that if we report this to the police,

210
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,119
the deal is off, right?

211
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:23,319
Shut up!

212
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:26,785
The police said that they'll nab the culprit at all cost!

213
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:28,519
And yet, they...

214
00:13:33,219 --> 00:13:34,419
Koda here!

215
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:36,319
I nabbed the man that fled!

216
00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:38,419
I confiscated the stuffed doll!

217
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:41,219
I see! Good work!

218
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:42,801
You look pale.

219
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:44,219
Does your wound still hurt?

220
00:13:44,219 --> 00:13:45,819
Wound?

221
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:49,419
Detective Koda was stabbed by a robber and hospitalized.

222
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:51,719
He was just discharged yesterday.

223
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:54,219
No, it's not that.

224
00:13:54,219 --> 00:13:57,819
The fact is there was no USB memory stick

225
00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:00,819
inside the doll that the man had.

226
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:03,319
-What? -That's ridiculous!

227
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:05,419
Doesn't that man have it on him?

228
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:07,419
No, he didn't have it.

229
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:08,619
Besides, the man says that

230
00:14:08,619 --> 00:14:10,819
he was asked by a man that he happened to meet at a bar to go

231
00:14:10,819 --> 00:14:14,833
and exchange the doll for the bag,

232
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,835
and insists that he knows nothing at all.

233
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:19,919
Then, he saw what the culprit looked like, didn't he?

234
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:22,841
The thing is, he says the man was wearing sunglasses and a mask

235
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:24,419
so he didn't see his face.

236
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:27,119
-Darn it! -Could it be that the culprit was planning

237
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:29,719
to just get hold of the 10,000,000 yen to begin with,

238
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:33,219
without putting the USB memory stick inside the doll?

239
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:36,419
Officer.

240
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:38,319
When the man fled,

241
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:40,619
he bumped into a little child, didn't he?

242
00:14:40,619 --> 00:14:43,819
Yeah, a cute American-Japanese boy.

243
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:47,919
He also had the same kind of Kumamon doll.

244
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:48,867
What?

245
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:51,419
So, maybe the dolls switched

246
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:54,219
when they bumped into each other, no?

247
00:14:54,219 --> 00:14:56,119
-Is that true? -Yes, sir.

248
00:14:56,119 --> 00:15:00,119
It's true that there was a non-Japanese mother and son.

249
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:03,319
Okay! Go look for them on the double!

250
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,885
But we don't have a clue as to where to look for them.

251
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:10,019
In fact, we know that boy.

252
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:11,919
-What? -It's Justin.

253
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:14,119
Then, do you know where they went?

254
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:16,895
Nope, I don't.

255
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:20,319
But Justin had a stamp book.

256
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,319
So, I think they headed for a place

257
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:24,019
where he could collect more stamps.

258
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:26,419
But there are many sightseeing places around here

259
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:29,719
that will give you stamps, you know.

260
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:32,319
Yep, but...

261
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:36,915
he showed us his stamp book at the Aso Volcano Museum.

262
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:38,719
At that time, he already had the stamp

263
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:44,019
for Aso ropeway and Aso farmland

264
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:46,219
so I guess those two places can be excluded.

265
00:15:46,219 --> 00:15:47,519
I see.

266
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,019
Excluding those places, the sightseeing place nearest here,

267
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,933
I think would be Aso Shrine.

268
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:57,719
Do they give stamps there?

269
00:15:57,719 --> 00:16:00,939
Yes, they do. But how amazing.

270
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:03,619
You have fantastic observation skills and a great memory!

271
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:06,119
I guess so!

272
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:08,619
Okay! Take that child along with you

273
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:10,219
and head for Aso Shrine.

274
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,119
I'll head for Kumamon Foods

275
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:14,219
with President Kumada and the others.

276
00:16:14,219 --> 00:16:16,955
Because the culprit may call.

277
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:18,119
Yes, sir!

278
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,419
And?

279
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:25,819
Why...

280
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,419
Does it have to turn out this way?

281
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:31,319
I want to find Justin no matter what!

282
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:34,519
Because I'm the one who got him involved.

283
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:36,419
It's not your fault, Ayumi.

284
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:38,419
Right! Don't worry about it.

285
00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:39,919
We've got to do our thing here,

286
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:43,419
or we'll blemish the name of the Youth Detective Squad!

287
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,983
Yep.

288
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:47,619
I'll take responsibility for them!

289
00:16:47,619 --> 00:16:49,719
Please rush over to Aso Shrine!

290
00:16:49,719 --> 00:16:51,319
All right!

291
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:58,319
"Aso Shrine"

292
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:06,019
A non-Japanese mother and son?

293
00:17:06,019 --> 00:17:08,619
Yeah, I did see them.

294
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:10,019
Really, sir?

295
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:14,719
Yeah. About an hour ago, he stamped his book here.

296
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:17,015
No doubt about it. It's Justin.

297
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:18,619
-Yep! -But...

298
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:21,819
did they say where they were headed for next?

299
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,819
If I remember correctly,

300
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:25,023
I think he said something about

301
00:17:25,219 --> 00:17:29,619
a place where "A big pig is lying asleep..."

302
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:33,919
What? A big pig is lying asleep?

303
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,035
There's a big black pig at Aso Milk Farm!

304
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:39,619
It's always sleeping, too.

305
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:41,919
-That's got to be it! -But...

306
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,119
Take a look at this, will you?

307
00:17:45,219 --> 00:17:48,619
When tracing Justin's path up to now,

308
00:17:48,619 --> 00:17:50,419
he visited Aso Volcano Museum,

309
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:53,051
Cuddly Dominion and Aso Shrine.

310
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:55,919
He's headed north.

311
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,719
But Aso Milk Farm is in the southwest direction, right?

312
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:02,319
True. It's true that it's in the opposite direction

313
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:03,519
when you look at the map.

314
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:09,067
Besides, the Aso Milk Farm is only open till 16:00.

315
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:11,069
What time is it now, Ran?

316
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:14,219
Huh? 15:40.

317
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,619
It's pretty far from here

318
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:19,077
and even if they were to have left about an hour ago,

319
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:22,519
I don't think that they could've made it there before closing time.

320
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,083
Either way, it'll be closed for sure

321
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,085
by the time we get there.

322
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:30,619
If they're headed north, there's the El Patio Farm.

323
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:33,619
I'm sure that there were no pigs there, though.

324
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:38,219
Other than that, major tourists sites to the north

325
00:18:38,219 --> 00:18:42,519
are the Kuninomiyatsuko Shrine and Mt. Daikanbo.

326
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:45,103
Mt. Daikanbo?

327
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:46,219
I see!

328
00:18:46,219 --> 00:18:48,719
Justin didn't say "A big pig",

329
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:51,119
but rather, "A big Buddha"!

330
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:53,119
What's a Buddha?

331
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:56,519
It's a deity. It's called Buddha in English.

332
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:59,619
Justin's mother is non-Japanese,

333
00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:02,219
so I'm sure that's what he was taught to call it.

334
00:19:02,219 --> 00:19:05,123
A big Buddha is lying asleep...

335
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:06,519
That's...

336
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:08,619
It's the landscape of Aso that looks to be the dying Buddha

337
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:11,129
attaining Nirvana that can be seen from Mt. Daikanbo.

338
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:18,019
Mr. Kosugi! We've figured out where the child is!

339
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:19,137
It's Mt. Daikanbo.

340
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:22,319
No, he's just saying that

341
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:24,519
and it's not definite yet.

342
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:27,819
If he says so, I think there's no doubt about it.

343
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:33,519
"Mt. Daikanbo"

344
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,719
True!

345
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:42,019
It looks like Buddha is lying asleep!

346
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:46,119
We've got to hurry and go find Justin.

347
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,419
Yeah.

348
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,619
No! Don't!

349
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:52,919
This is Justin's!

350
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:55,619
Just what're you doing to mommy?

351
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:57,719
Give it back to me!

352
00:19:57,719 --> 00:19:59,177
Hold it!

353
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:03,819
Let go of me! What do you think you're doing?

354
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:08,019
Watch out!

355
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:23,919
-Kajiyama! -Mr. Kosugi!

356
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,819
Please go after that car that just went by!

357
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:30,119
The child was kidnapped by the culprit!

358
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:31,619
What?

359
00:20:49,219 --> 00:20:52,819
The culprit's planning to flee into Kumamoto City.

360
00:20:56,819 --> 00:20:58,719
Kosugi here!

361
00:20:58,719 --> 00:21:01,519
This is Inoue from Kumamon Foods!

362
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:03,719
I just got a call from the culprit!

363
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:04,719
What?

364
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:09,247
"Don't come after me, or the child is dead!"

365
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,919
Darn it.

366
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,419
Kajiyama, stop pursuit!

367
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:16,119
Huh? But...

368
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:18,319
They seem to have gotten a call from the culprit

369
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,259
saying that the child will die otherwise.

370
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:23,819
Okay.

371
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:28,319
Justin! He tried to help me...

372
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,269
Don't worry. I'm sure he's okay.

373
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,273
Strange.

374
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:37,019
How on earth did the culprit know

375
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:40,219
that Justin was at Mt. Daikanbo?

376
00:21:40,219 --> 00:21:43,819
Rather, how did the culprit know that the USB memory stick

377
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:47,719
was inside the doll that Justin was holding to begin with?

378
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:49,287
We found out that there'd been a switch

379
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:52,219
only after the man who fled got caught.

380
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:55,293
The ones that knew about this were us,

381
00:21:55,293 --> 00:21:57,295
the officers of the Kumamoto Prefectural, Police-Officer Kosugi,

382
00:21:57,295 --> 00:21:59,297
Officer Kajiyama,

383
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,719
Mr. Kumada of Kumamon Foods and Mr. Inoue.

384
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:06,119
But when the culprit kidnapped Justin,

385
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:08,619
Mr. Kumada and Inoue were at the company.

386
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,619
We were at the site of the crime, and we all have alibis.

387
00:22:13,311 --> 00:22:15,313
Which means...

388
00:22:15,313 --> 00:22:19,119
Is there an accomplice to the culprit among the people here?

389
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:24,219
And who on earth is the culprit?

390
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,380
Next Conan's Hint:

391
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,480
"Stamp Book"

392
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,190
The Youth Detective Squad do their job in Aso.

393
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,413
-Is that so? -Even the bear will melt.
