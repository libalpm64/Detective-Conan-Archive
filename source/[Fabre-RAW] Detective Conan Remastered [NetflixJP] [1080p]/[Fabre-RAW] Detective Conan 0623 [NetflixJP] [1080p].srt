1
00:00:02,291 --> 00:00:03,391
We're in big trouble!

2
00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:06,591
The Youth Detective Squad's in a pinch!

3
00:00:06,591 --> 00:00:09,391
It all started when we started playing Kick the Can!

4
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:11,291
We were in a building that was scheduled to be brought down,

5
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:12,391
and nobody was inside,

6
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:14,891
so I thought it was okay to play there,

7
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:17,591
but I heard a banging sound from inside!

8
00:00:17,591 --> 00:00:19,999
The rhythm that was being pounded was "252",

9
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:22,001
the code that the Tokyo Metropolitan Fire Department

10
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:26,005
uses to indicate that there is someone needing to be rescued.

11
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:30,009
We looked around thinking that somebody needed help.

12
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:31,691
But the people who were making the noise

13
00:00:31,691 --> 00:00:34,691
were workers who were going to bring down the building.

14
00:00:34,691 --> 00:00:38,017
So, we were kind of thrown off, but...

15
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:39,791
Conan realized

16
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,591
that they were actually bad people

17
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:44,023
and that they had locked someone up!

18
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:46,691
We were going to contact the police,

19
00:00:46,691 --> 00:00:48,791
but the men found us and...

20
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:52,691
They caught Conan!

21
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:56,035
The doorway of the building is blocked and we can't escape,

22
00:00:56,035 --> 00:01:00,039
so we've got no choice but to find a way to contact the police but...

23
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,043
If we do so, those guy will find out right away.

24
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:08,891
So, we agreed to use Ai's idea to deceive those men!

25
00:01:08,891 --> 00:01:12,051
Although the strategy seemed to work at first,

26
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:14,491
next, Ai was caught.

27
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,059
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

28
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:22,591
You must be true to yourself.

29
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:24,063
Decipher the code and overcome

30
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:26,065
the pinch you're in, Detective Squad.

31
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,067
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:30,069
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:32,391
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

34
00:03:13,187 --> 00:03:19,087
"Emergency 252 Part 2"

35
00:03:20,487 --> 00:03:21,587
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

36
00:03:21,587 --> 00:03:24,183
-Call the police, the police! -Hurry, hurry!

37
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:26,185
It's calling now...

38
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:28,187
Hey brats!

39
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:29,787
Can you hear me?

40
00:03:29,787 --> 00:03:32,187
If you dare call the police,

41
00:03:32,187 --> 00:03:37,187
the brown-haired girl and boy with glasses are going to die! You get that?

42
00:03:37,187 --> 00:03:38,197
What?

43
00:03:38,387 --> 00:03:40,887
Yes! 911...

44
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,687
"Calling" -Is something wrong? Is it an accident?

45
00:03:44,987 --> 00:03:47,387
Hello?

46
00:03:48,587 --> 00:03:50,209
What's the matter?

47
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:52,211
Hello?

48
00:03:53,087 --> 00:03:54,687
Hey!

49
00:03:56,387 --> 00:03:59,087
Aren't you going to report this to the police?

50
00:03:59,087 --> 00:04:00,787
I've got no choice.

51
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:03,487
We'll get Conan and Ai in trouble!

52
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,587
But now what? What do we do?

53
00:04:07,587 --> 00:04:09,587
What shall we do?

54
00:04:09,587 --> 00:04:11,687
At any rate, let's hide somewhere!

55
00:04:11,687 --> 00:04:12,887
Okay.

56
00:04:23,187 --> 00:04:25,387
There aren't any sounds of sirens...

57
00:04:25,387 --> 00:04:28,887
Which means the brats are obeying my orders.

58
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:32,787
So, what do we do with these two kids?

59
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:36,587
Take them to the fourth floor where the gramps is locked up!

60
00:04:36,587 --> 00:04:39,587
I'll go look for the rest of the brats.

61
00:04:39,587 --> 00:04:43,587
By the way, are you sure that gramps has money or what?

62
00:04:43,587 --> 00:04:46,587
Yeah, I hear he's making millions.

63
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:50,687
But, no one answers each time we call his house!

64
00:04:50,687 --> 00:04:52,887
She'll be back soon.

65
00:04:52,887 --> 00:04:54,287
His only daughter about intermediate school age,

66
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:56,987
who answers the phone sometimes!

67
00:04:56,987 --> 00:05:00,279
We'll threaten that daughter and make her bring the ransom here.

68
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:02,281
Then we'll lock her into this building too,

69
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:04,283
and set fire to the place before we split.

70
00:05:04,487 --> 00:05:05,587
Right.

71
00:05:05,587 --> 00:05:08,887
But, talk about a bunch of unlucky kids.

72
00:05:08,887 --> 00:05:10,887
If they didn't come play here,

73
00:05:10,887 --> 00:05:13,887
they didn't have to become burnt black and down to ashes.

74
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:16,887
Okay, I'll go look for the other kids,

75
00:05:16,887 --> 00:05:19,487
so you watch those two.

76
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,687
You can never tell what they'll do.

77
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:23,387
Yes siree.

78
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:33,687
Darn!

79
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:35,687
Why aren't they anywhere in sight?

80
00:05:35,687 --> 00:05:39,787
Hey, it's already after 6 pm, you know!

81
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:42,321
We'd better hurry or the parents of these brats

82
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:44,323
may start getting worried and make a fuss.

83
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:47,087
How's the old man doing?

84
00:05:47,087 --> 00:05:50,887
The old man that we kidnapped and locked up inside that locker!

85
00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:54,333
Oh, when I looked in a while ago, he was still asleep.

86
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,987
And? Did you call the old man's house?

87
00:05:56,987 --> 00:05:59,187
Yeah, I've been calling for some time now,

88
00:05:59,187 --> 00:06:02,341
but no one's answering!

89
00:06:02,587 --> 00:06:07,087
I wonder where those brats disappeared to, anyway.

90
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:09,287
Did you look good enough?

91
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:14,087
Yeah, I'm not sloppy like you but rather meticulous, you see.

92
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:16,355
I looked through every nook and cranny!

93
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:19,987
And they still can't find them,

94
00:06:19,987 --> 00:06:22,361
which means they're unmistakably hiding

95
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:25,787
in one of the lockers of this room.

96
00:06:32,787 --> 00:06:36,087
They got here before we were brought here,

97
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:38,377
and ended up not being able to come out.

98
00:06:38,587 --> 00:06:39,887
We've got no choice,

99
00:06:39,887 --> 00:06:42,381
let's look once more and if we still can't find them,

100
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:44,387
let's set fire to this place and split.

101
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:47,787
Yeah, I guess we'll just have to give up on the money.

102
00:06:47,787 --> 00:06:49,487
Make sure you pour the gasoline thoroughly!

103
00:06:49,487 --> 00:06:51,687
Aye! You can count on me!

104
00:06:51,687 --> 00:06:53,387
What shall we do?

105
00:06:53,387 --> 00:06:55,187
We'll all be burnt black.

106
00:06:55,187 --> 00:06:57,887
Maybe we've got no choice but to beat them up after all.

107
00:06:57,887 --> 00:06:59,287
Right.

108
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:03,787
Maybe it's our chance right now, since that man's alone.

109
00:07:03,787 --> 00:07:06,187
That sound just now is from the detective squad badge...

110
00:07:06,187 --> 00:07:07,787
Huh?

111
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:13,087
-Just as I thought. -Maybe this is...

112
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:15,487
It's Conan after all.

113
00:07:15,487 --> 00:07:18,787
Conan's tapping on the floor using the detective squad badge!

114
00:07:21,787 --> 00:07:24,087
The sound we just heard was,

115
00:07:24,087 --> 00:07:27,187
first, twice, next five times and finally four times, right?

116
00:07:27,187 --> 00:07:29,387
Isn't this the "what's it called" code

117
00:07:29,387 --> 00:07:31,687
that you mentioned before, Mitsuhiko?

118
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:34,433
The code that the Tokyo Metropolitan Fire Department uses!

119
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:37,087
"254" means...

120
00:07:37,087 --> 00:07:38,437
to wait at the site.

121
00:07:41,287 --> 00:07:43,187
Oh, that's right.

122
00:07:43,187 --> 00:07:47,387
Don't you guys dare move from there until I tell you to!

123
00:07:54,987 --> 00:07:58,457
But, things do look pretty bad.

124
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:01,587
Those guys kidnapped an old man from somewhere and locked him up.

125
00:08:01,587 --> 00:08:05,287
They're also demanding ransom.

126
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:06,887
We, who just happened to come play here,

127
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,467
coincidentally run into them.

128
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:11,287
Ai and I are caught and rendered helpless.

129
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:17,387
One of the men is pouring gasoline in the room

130
00:08:17,387 --> 00:08:19,587
so that he can burn all of us together with the hostage,

131
00:08:19,587 --> 00:08:22,487
and the other one is off looking for Genta and the others.

132
00:08:22,487 --> 00:08:27,487
The kids are probably in one of the lockers of this room

133
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:29,087
and cannot come out.

134
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:32,491
In order to get out of this predicament,

135
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:34,493
the only thing to do is to get the one standing guard

136
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:37,687
away from this fourth floor room but...

137
00:08:39,187 --> 00:08:40,887
Stink...

138
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,287
I guess I'll really pour all of it out

139
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:44,787
just before igniting the place.

140
00:08:44,787 --> 00:08:49,387
With my mouth gagged and both my hands and legs tied,

141
00:08:49,387 --> 00:08:51,087
the only thing I can do isto give orders to Genta and the others

142
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:54,987
by banging the detective squad badge against the floor.

143
00:08:54,987 --> 00:08:57,787
How do I get him to go outside with this?

144
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:02,521
I guess I'll try calling the home of the old man we kidnapped again then.

145
00:09:03,687 --> 00:09:05,087
Telephone...

146
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,887
Come to think of it...

147
00:09:06,887 --> 00:09:10,887
Huh? Conan, your cell phone standby display

148
00:09:10,887 --> 00:09:13,187
is the man at the detective agency!

149
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:16,087
Yeah, when Pops came back drunk the other day,

150
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:19,287
he fooled around with this and the standby display's been this way since.

151
00:09:19,287 --> 00:09:22,887
Mine is of me doing sparklers!

152
00:09:22,887 --> 00:09:25,987
I've got it in my school bag, so I'll show it to you later!

153
00:09:25,987 --> 00:09:28,547
Mine is Kamen Yaiba!

154
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:30,087
How about you, Ai?

155
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,551
Doc's sleeping face.

156
00:09:32,787 --> 00:09:36,555
Mine is of a stray cat living in the neighbourhood

157
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:39,621
but I seem to have dropped it while playing kick the can.

158
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:42,561
Wait a second.

159
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:47,521
My cell phone is in the second floor corridor where I passed out.

160
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:51,721
Ayumi's is probably in her school bag on the first floor.

161
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:56,221
Genta's is probably somewhere on the third floor where he was hiding.

162
00:09:56,221 --> 00:10:00,021
Before Ai was captured by them, they body checked her,

163
00:10:00,021 --> 00:10:01,921
but she had no cell phone on her,

164
00:10:01,921 --> 00:10:03,321
so it must be in her school bag lying there

165
00:10:03,321 --> 00:10:08,587
that was kicked by one of the kidnappers.

166
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:10,121
And Mitsuhiko's is...

167
00:10:10,821 --> 00:10:13,621
The cell phones are nicely scattered in place!

168
00:10:24,021 --> 00:10:26,921
I tell you, when the heck is the daughter f that old man

169
00:10:26,921 --> 00:10:29,421
going to come home anyway?

170
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:30,621
Hello.

171
00:10:34,321 --> 00:10:35,521
What?

172
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:38,021
A young man answered the phone?

173
00:10:38,021 --> 00:10:39,321
Yeah.

174
00:10:39,321 --> 00:10:42,421
Are you sure you called the old man's house, or what?

175
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:46,021
I'm sure I dialed the right number!

176
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:49,421
I hung up and re-dialed the number right away after confirming it

177
00:10:49,421 --> 00:10:51,921
but the same man answered again!

178
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:55,921
And? Did you talk to that man about anything?

179
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:59,821
Of course not. I thought he was a cop and hung up right away!

180
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:01,521
Idiot!

181
00:11:01,521 --> 00:11:03,221
It couldn't have been a cop

182
00:11:03,221 --> 00:11:07,221
because no one knows that the old man's been kidnapped or what yet.

183
00:11:07,221 --> 00:11:10,221
But the story's different!

184
00:11:10,221 --> 00:11:13,321
At first the story was that the old man is living with his daughter

185
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:14,921
who is about intermediate school age that sometimes picks up the phone.

186
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:16,655
Our plan was to threaten her

187
00:11:16,821 --> 00:11:19,221
and make her bring over the ransom, correct?

188
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:21,521
Something's not right.

189
00:11:21,521 --> 00:11:22,661
I guess so.

190
00:11:23,321 --> 00:11:25,321
Since things are starting to look sober,

191
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:26,665
I guess we've got no choice.

192
00:11:26,665 --> 00:11:29,121
Let's set fire to this place and split!

193
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:32,671
Let's burn to ashes the hostage as well as the kids!

194
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:34,673
Set fire to this place and split?

195
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:37,521
I mean all the kids have seen our faces!

196
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:40,679
Rats, I've got to do something right away.

197
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:43,821
What about the kids that we haven't found yet?

198
00:11:43,821 --> 00:11:45,121
How should I know?

199
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:51,221
A sound is coming from the detective squad badge again.

200
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:53,821
The sound is "555".

201
00:11:53,821 --> 00:11:57,221
"555" is the code for report by phone.

202
00:11:57,221 --> 00:12:00,221
Maybe he wants us to contact the police?

203
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:05,021
No, that would be "554" dispatch the police.

204
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:07,721
Then, where are we supposed to call?

205
00:12:15,321 --> 00:12:16,715
That sound again.

206
00:12:17,721 --> 00:12:20,221
The figure from the sound is "953"!

207
00:12:20,221 --> 00:12:24,723
"953" is a code that means the cause of the fire is, playing with fire.

208
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:26,521
Isn't he trying to say,

209
00:12:26,521 --> 00:12:29,021
"Tell the police that they're planning to set this place on fire"?

210
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:31,821
But, the code for arson is "951".

211
00:12:31,821 --> 00:12:35,421
Then, maybe it means to call the person who is playing with fire?

212
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,321
Person who's playing with fire?

213
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:41,421
I get it! Ayumi's cell phone!

214
00:12:41,421 --> 00:12:45,021
It probably means to call Ayumi's phone

215
00:12:45,021 --> 00:12:48,121
that has a standby image of her playing with sparklers!

216
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:52,751
What're you all worked up about?

217
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:54,753
Set the place on fire and hurry on down here!

218
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:57,821
Who knows where the other brats are,

219
00:12:57,821 --> 00:12:59,821
but by the time people realize that the building's on fire,

220
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:03,521
they'll be covered with smoke and crossed over!

221
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:04,763
Hold it!

222
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:06,521
It's the ringtone of the cell phone.

223
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:08,767
The brats are on the first floor!

224
00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:12,771
Hey, where the heck are you?

225
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:14,321
Give yourselves up and come out here!

226
00:13:14,321 --> 00:13:16,775
Okay, next...

227
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:27,421
"655"...

228
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:30,321
"655" is totally wasted!

229
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:32,521
Meaning a person who is totally wasted.

230
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:34,221
Then...

231
00:13:34,221 --> 00:13:36,121
It's Conan's cell phone!

232
00:13:36,121 --> 00:13:38,321
Because his standby image was one taken together

233
00:13:38,321 --> 00:13:41,521
with the drunk man at the detective agency!

234
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:44,521
Hey, how about it?

235
00:13:44,521 --> 00:13:46,321
Did you find the brats?

236
00:13:46,321 --> 00:13:49,221
Well, the ringtone suddenly stopped

237
00:13:49,221 --> 00:13:51,721
and it seems that the cell phone was switched off.

238
00:13:52,521 --> 00:13:54,813
No, it's upstairs!

239
00:13:55,021 --> 00:13:57,721
A ring tone from another cell phone is ringing upstairs.

240
00:13:57,721 --> 00:13:58,817
I'll go look for them, then.

241
00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:00,821
No! I'll go!

242
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:03,521
You stay there and watch the kids!

243
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:15,221
Don't tell me that they all split up and hid in different places.

244
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:18,421
"Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya Calling"

245
00:14:18,421 --> 00:14:20,521
"One missed call"

246
00:14:20,521 --> 00:14:24,843
Okay, before he finishes climbing the stairs, here goes the next one.

247
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:36,855
Address unknown?

248
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:38,857
Yeah. "658" is a code that

249
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:41,221
indicates someone with an unknown address!

250
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:42,521
What's that mean?

251
00:14:42,521 --> 00:14:44,621
It means someone who doesn't have a stable home he lives in

252
00:14:44,621 --> 00:14:46,421
and goes here and there.

253
00:14:46,421 --> 00:14:48,421
Don't tell me

254
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:51,221
that means the stray cat on the standby display of my cell phone?

255
00:14:55,121 --> 00:14:56,875
Another ringtone?

256
00:14:57,621 --> 00:15:00,879
Hey! It's another ringtone from the top floor.

257
00:15:03,221 --> 00:15:06,221
If it's that sound, I can hear it slightly

258
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:07,821
from the place on the fourth floor where I am now too!

259
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:10,621
Maybe the brats are climbing up to the top floor?

260
00:15:10,621 --> 00:15:13,421
Okay, this is it.

261
00:15:20,221 --> 00:15:21,721
"652: Bed-ridden aged person"

262
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,421
"652" means bed-ridden aged person.

263
00:15:24,421 --> 00:15:25,921
I'm sure that's...

264
00:15:25,921 --> 00:15:27,621
The standby image of Ai's cell phone.

265
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:29,321
-Doc's sleeping face! -Doc's sleeping face!

266
00:15:36,421 --> 00:15:38,917
I think I heard the voices of the kids just now.

267
00:15:39,821 --> 00:15:40,921
Hey.

268
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:46,925
Don't tell me that they're in one of these lockers.

269
00:16:07,691 --> 00:16:08,947
Hey!

270
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:11,391
It's the vibe sound of the cell phone!

271
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:13,691
And, I hear it really near too!

272
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:17,591
Hey, what's up?

273
00:16:17,591 --> 00:16:18,957
It's stopped.

274
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:22,961
It seems that the brats are looking for each other

275
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:24,963
by communicating on their cell phones.

276
00:16:25,191 --> 00:16:27,891
Okay, block the door of that room with something,

277
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:29,291
and you search for them too!

278
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,991
-Okay! -I'll ambush them at the stairs,

279
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,991
so you threaten them with your voice and corner them,

280
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:35,791
then, we'll sandwich them!

281
00:16:44,991 --> 00:16:47,291
Well, I guess this'll do.

282
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:50,091
Hey brats, get out here!

283
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:52,491
I know you're some place nearby!

284
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:56,991
Strange.

285
00:16:56,991 --> 00:16:58,691
I don't hear anything anymore.

286
00:16:58,691 --> 00:17:00,191
Same here.

287
00:17:10,491 --> 00:17:11,891
It's the brat's cell phone!

288
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:13,491
It was dropped in the corridor!

289
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,391
What does that mean?

290
00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:18,091
The brat was ringing the cell phones of his friends

291
00:17:18,091 --> 00:17:20,391
one after the other to confuse us.

292
00:17:20,391 --> 00:17:23,591
Then, where the heck are the brats?

293
00:17:23,591 --> 00:17:26,091
I see! I got it!

294
00:17:26,091 --> 00:17:28,191
It's the room that he's locked up in!

295
00:17:28,191 --> 00:17:32,391
This was a strategy to pull you away from that room!

296
00:17:32,391 --> 00:17:34,791
So, the brats are in that room?

297
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:38,191
Yeah! We've haven't looked through the lockers in that room at all!

298
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:41,491
Darn! Then the voices of the brats that I heard a while ago was...

299
00:17:41,491 --> 00:17:42,491
Punks!

300
00:17:42,491 --> 00:17:45,591
Never mind and just go get all the brats and nab them!

301
00:17:45,591 --> 00:17:51,049
Darn! Those brats, how dare they get wise with me!

302
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:52,491
Gotcha!

303
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:57,891
Hey?

304
00:17:57,891 --> 00:17:59,391
Hey, what's the matter?

305
00:17:59,391 --> 00:18:01,059
Did you find the brats?

306
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:02,191
Answer me!

307
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:05,063
No, the brats all got away.

308
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:07,065
Maybe they've already reported us to the police.

309
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:09,391
I'm getting out of here because I don't want more trouble!

310
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:11,069
I think you should split as soon as you can too!

311
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,491
Hey!

312
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:13,991
Hold it!

313
00:18:18,191 --> 00:18:21,691
But, why did he let one get away?

314
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:24,591
Because if it's just one, if we join hands, we could...

315
00:18:24,591 --> 00:18:25,891
Don't worry!

316
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:30,391
As to the other guy, he'll spit it all out at the police.

317
00:18:30,391 --> 00:18:32,191
There're no more weapons left,

318
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:35,093
so there's no need to take anymore risky chances!

319
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,891
No. Footsteps... do you hear them?

320
00:18:48,891 --> 00:18:50,691
It's getting closer.

321
00:18:50,691 --> 00:18:52,391
He didn't run away.

322
00:19:04,891 --> 00:19:06,391
You guys stay back!

323
00:19:12,191 --> 00:19:14,091
This thing I sense...

324
00:19:14,091 --> 00:19:15,133
Don't tell me that it's...

325
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:28,891
Subaru.

326
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:30,391
What brings you here?

327
00:19:30,391 --> 00:19:35,153
Well, the lights didn't go on even after sundown

328
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:37,155
so I got worried and went to check things out.

329
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:39,157
Then, I found the front door unlocked,

330
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:41,891
and neither Doc nor that girl was there.

331
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:44,091
I was wondering what I should do,

332
00:19:44,091 --> 00:19:47,165
when two calls came in with no one talking.

333
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:49,691
So, I thought that maybe both of them got messed up in a case

334
00:19:49,691 --> 00:19:51,591
or something and were in trouble.

335
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:55,173
I went into Doc's room and used the spare pursuit glasses

336
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:57,175
I found there and tried to pinpoint the location

337
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:58,291
of the detective squad badge.

338
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,791
That's how managed to get here!

339
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,791
Then, don't tell me that the old man that was kidnapped is...

340
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:04,891
Yes.

341
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:07,191
It's somebody that all of you know very well.

342
00:20:11,891 --> 00:20:13,491
Dr. Agasa!

343
00:20:14,691 --> 00:20:16,891
-Doc! -Doc!

344
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:19,591
I think that if the front door wasn't locked,

345
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:21,591
the culprit probably disguised himself

346
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:23,891
as a courier or something and got in,

347
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:27,205
Then kidnapped Doc and locked him up here.

348
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:28,391
They probably mistakenly thought that

349
00:20:28,391 --> 00:20:30,391
since Doc invents many things,

350
00:20:31,691 --> 00:20:34,591
he must be making millions from them.

351
00:20:34,591 --> 00:20:36,291
I guess so.

352
00:20:36,691 --> 00:20:41,791
Doc's inventions are all junk and he's actually dirt poor.

353
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:45,223
Then, the intermediate school girl that sometimes answers the phone is...

354
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:47,225
Were they talking about Ai?

355
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:51,229
Ai has a very grown up voice as well as a style of talking too.

356
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:52,791
By the way, Subaru,

357
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,991
did you run into the other culprit?

358
00:20:55,991 --> 00:20:58,591
I found him passed out on the stairs.

359
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:02,891
I'm sure he tripped in his haste to run down the stairs when fleeing.

360
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:05,591
But Subaru's like superman!

361
00:21:05,591 --> 00:21:08,891
Sensing the slightest abnormality and coming to the rescue.

362
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:10,191
I guess so.

363
00:21:11,991 --> 00:21:15,991
To come and check the house out only because the lights weren't turned on.

364
00:21:15,991 --> 00:21:18,991
It's like you've been watching the house right through.

365
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:30,991
Yes,

366
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:34,591
the fact is, I was watching the house right through for you to come home!

367
00:21:38,991 --> 00:21:41,279
I made too much curry for lunch,

368
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:42,891
so was thinking of sharing it with you.

369
00:21:42,891 --> 00:21:43,991
Curry.

370
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:48,191
So, tomorrow we're all having curry for lunch at Doc's house!

371
00:21:48,191 --> 00:21:51,289
Curry is said to be the most delicious on the second day too.

372
00:23:20,091 --> 00:23:21,791
"The Next Day"

373
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:25,383
You mean you kicked the wall not knowing what "252" meant?

374
00:23:25,383 --> 00:23:28,291
Yeah, I heard the voices of you all,

375
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:31,391
so I kicked the wall hoping for the faintest chance that you would hear me!

376
00:23:31,391 --> 00:23:34,891
With a strong desire that you would call the police right away!

377
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:45,403
Call the police right away...

378
00:23:45,403 --> 00:23:48,291
It's coincidentally "252".

379
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:52,091
I'm glad that my feelings got through somehow and am glad!

380
00:23:52,091 --> 00:23:54,891
Goes to show you can transmit your thoughts if you try!

381
00:23:56,491 --> 00:23:59,691
You mean I sound that old?

382
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,220
Next Conans Hint:

383
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,440
"Sweaty Person"

384
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,130
The next episode is about Officer Chiba's first love.

385
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,780
First love is so ordinary.
