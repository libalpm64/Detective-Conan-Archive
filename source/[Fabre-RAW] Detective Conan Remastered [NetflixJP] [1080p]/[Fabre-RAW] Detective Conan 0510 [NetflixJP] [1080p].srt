1
00:00:04,367 --> 00:00:05,667
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:06,867
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:06,867 --> 00:00:08,567
And start the countdown to deduction and love.

4
00:00:08,567 --> 00:00:09,989
Today's episode is made up of two parts.

5
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:11,991
You need to deduce twice as much as usual.

6
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:13,367
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:14,967
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,967 --> 00:00:17,167
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:00,778
A new member of the Black Organization has made his move.

10
00:02:00,778 --> 00:02:03,078
His code name is Bourbon.

11
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:05,878
Is he after Ai?

12
00:02:05,878 --> 00:02:07,478
The members of the Youth Detective Squad

13
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:09,278
are asked by Kaito Sugiura

14
00:02:09,278 --> 00:02:12,478
to check on one of the residents of the apartment

15
00:02:12,478 --> 00:02:16,115
who acts suspiciously every night.

16
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:18,778
But when we got there, we found that the apartment has gone to ashes.

17
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:22,121
In Kaito's burnt diary, the three residents of the apartment

18
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:23,478
are referred to as their nicknames,

19
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:27,778
Red Person, White Person and Yellow Person.

20
00:02:27,778 --> 00:02:29,478
It says that the Yellow Person

21
00:02:29,478 --> 00:02:31,778
is the one who was acting suspicious.

22
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:33,378
The person who set fire to the apartment

23
00:02:33,378 --> 00:02:35,578
is most likely the Yellow Person as well.

24
00:02:39,178 --> 00:02:41,878
I, Kuroshiro,

25
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:45,878
will now reveal the truth as clear as black and white.

26
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:48,147
As well as which one among them

27
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:51,778
is the yellow arsonist.

28
00:02:54,378 --> 00:02:57,878
"Conan VS Double Code Mystery"

29
00:02:59,778 --> 00:03:02,478
Just what is this Yellow Arsonist all about?

30
00:03:02,478 --> 00:03:05,778
I heard you saying something about a diary too.

31
00:03:05,778 --> 00:03:09,578
Well. It's the diary of Kaito, the son of the landlord of this apartment

32
00:03:09,578 --> 00:03:11,578
that was burned down by fire.

33
00:03:11,578 --> 00:03:14,173
It is written in the diary

34
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:17,378
that the Yellow Person suddenly came back in the middle of night

35
00:03:17,378 --> 00:03:19,778
and had an argument with his father.

36
00:03:19,778 --> 00:03:22,678
"Ryuhei Hosoi (25), Carpenter" -All three of you were out

37
00:03:22,678 --> 00:03:23,778
"Subaru Okiya (27), Postgraduate Student" -on the night of the fire,

38
00:03:23,778 --> 00:03:24,978
and came back in the morning.

39
00:03:24,978 --> 00:03:26,578
"Ginya Makabe (29), Freelancer" -Right?

40
00:03:26,578 --> 00:03:29,678
That means someone's lying!

41
00:03:29,678 --> 00:03:32,478
That liar, the Yellow Guy,

42
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,978
is the one who set fire to the apartment!

43
00:03:34,978 --> 00:03:38,197
It's true that I know the landlord's son.

44
00:03:38,378 --> 00:03:41,778
Was anyone of us called the Yellow Person by him?

45
00:03:41,778 --> 00:03:43,078
I wonder, too.

46
00:03:43,078 --> 00:03:46,678
It's just words from a child, so don't worry about it.

47
00:03:49,278 --> 00:03:52,878
You shouldn't tell anyone about the Yellow Person.

48
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:54,878
What? Why not?

49
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:57,278
If they find out that the Yellow Person is the arsonist,

50
00:03:57,278 --> 00:04:01,678
they might all claim that they're not the one, right?

51
00:04:01,678 --> 00:04:04,223
-I get it now. -I see.

52
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:07,378
No. That's nothing to worry about.

53
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:11,878
Because I already know which one among the three

54
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:13,878
is the yellow arsonist.

55
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:14,978
What?

56
00:04:14,978 --> 00:04:17,178
Hey, kid. Are you serious?

57
00:04:17,178 --> 00:04:18,237
Yes.

58
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:20,239
Ayumi, can you lend me that diary?

59
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,378
Okay.

60
00:04:21,378 --> 00:04:23,178
Red Person and White Person

61
00:04:23,178 --> 00:04:25,878
are mentioned in Kaito's diary too.

62
00:04:25,878 --> 00:04:29,078
So if we figure out who the Red and White Person are,

63
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:32,251
we'll be able to find out who the Yellow Person is.

64
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:34,778
So there's a Red Person and a White Person too?

65
00:04:34,778 --> 00:04:38,257
Yes. It's written in the diary.

66
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:40,578
"The weather's been bad since this morning.

67
00:04:40,578 --> 00:04:43,578
I've got to go to school soon,

68
00:04:43,578 --> 00:04:46,265
but I'm sure the Red Person can sleep in today."

69
00:04:46,265 --> 00:04:49,778
This hints that the Red Person does something every morning,

70
00:04:49,778 --> 00:04:51,678
but since it was raining that morning,

71
00:04:51,678 --> 00:04:55,178
he didn't have to do it, right?

72
00:04:55,178 --> 00:04:57,178
What do you think that is?

73
00:04:57,178 --> 00:04:59,078
He didn't have to hang the laundry.

74
00:04:59,078 --> 00:05:01,778
Field day is cancelled if it rains!

75
00:05:01,778 --> 00:05:04,283
Adults don't have field days.

76
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:05,878
It's sprinkling water.

77
00:05:05,878 --> 00:05:07,778
Watering the flowers.

78
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:09,178
Oh, I see!

79
00:05:09,178 --> 00:05:10,289
Yeah!

80
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:12,078
That's why the Red Person is the one

81
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:15,478
who said that he waters the plants of the apartment every day.

82
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:18,297
Mr. Okiya.

83
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,778
But kid, why did he call the man the Red Person?

84
00:05:22,778 --> 00:05:27,278
Well, you found a lot of toy cars in Kaito's room, didn't you?

85
00:05:27,278 --> 00:05:30,578
I'm sure that Kaito loves cars.

86
00:05:30,578 --> 00:05:32,311
When you think of a red car,

87
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:34,678
the first thing that comes to mind is...

88
00:05:34,678 --> 00:05:36,978
A fire engine...

89
00:05:36,978 --> 00:05:42,321
I see. Kaito saw the man watering the plants with a hose,

90
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:44,323
then connected him to a fire engine,

91
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:47,378
and named him the Red Person.

92
00:05:47,378 --> 00:05:51,178
So is the White Person named in connection with a white car?

93
00:05:51,178 --> 00:05:54,333
But there are so many white cars around.

94
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,878
It's an ambulance.

95
00:05:55,878 --> 00:05:58,337
In Japan, the colour of the vehicle

96
00:05:58,337 --> 00:06:00,878
is determined by the Road Trucking Vehicle Law.

97
00:06:00,878 --> 00:06:02,341
I see...

98
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:05,578
But which one of them is the ambulance?

99
00:06:05,578 --> 00:06:08,078
What does an ambulance do?

100
00:06:08,078 --> 00:06:10,349
Carry wounded people from place to place.

101
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:12,878
The paramedics give treatment in the car too.

102
00:06:12,878 --> 00:06:15,078
Oh, I get it!

103
00:06:15,078 --> 00:06:17,178
Band aid!

104
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:19,678
The White Person frequently gets hurt,

105
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:22,361
so he always carries band aids around.

106
00:06:22,578 --> 00:06:24,678
So, it's Mr. Hosoi.

107
00:06:24,678 --> 00:06:26,365
Come to think of it, he had also written in the diary

108
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:28,978
that when he came back from school and fell at the front door,

109
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:32,178
he was glad that the White Person happened to be going out.

110
00:06:32,178 --> 00:06:35,278
Yeah. I gave the kid a band aid

111
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:38,178
because his knee was bleeding.

112
00:06:38,178 --> 00:06:41,278
Things like that happened several times before,

113
00:06:41,278 --> 00:06:43,978
but who'd ever think that he'd call a black guy like me the White Person.

114
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:46,678
Now, for the remaining Yellow Person.

115
00:06:46,678 --> 00:06:48,678
A taxi's yellow.

116
00:06:48,678 --> 00:06:51,678
But there are white and green taxis too.

117
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:54,393
It's the vehicle used for construction.

118
00:06:54,578 --> 00:06:56,395
Yes. In other words,

119
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:59,378
the man who has soil in his fingernails.

120
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:03,578
Mr. Makabe, you're the Yellow Person.

121
00:07:03,578 --> 00:07:05,578
Just what are you talking about?

122
00:07:05,578 --> 00:07:07,178
There's soil in my fingernails

123
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:11,178
because I ran around the mountains when I did the survival game.

124
00:07:11,178 --> 00:07:12,878
If I remember correctly, you said that the colour of the paint bullet

125
00:07:12,878 --> 00:07:17,178
wouldn't come off, so your clothes were ruined?

126
00:07:17,178 --> 00:07:18,178
Yeah.

127
00:07:18,178 --> 00:07:21,778
In the survival games carried out in Japan,

128
00:07:21,778 --> 00:07:24,423
air soft guns that fire BB bullets are used.

129
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,078
The game that uses paint bullets

130
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:30,078
is a different game called paintball.

131
00:07:30,078 --> 00:07:32,431
They... they're not that different.

132
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:35,278
But paint bullets contain water-based ink,

133
00:07:35,278 --> 00:07:37,978
so the paint washes off easily.

134
00:07:39,078 --> 00:07:40,439
Well...

135
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:43,278
Besides, you said you like the colour navy green

136
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:45,778
that's found on camouflage outfits,

137
00:07:45,778 --> 00:07:49,278
but the type of green colour that's usually used on those outfits

138
00:07:49,278 --> 00:07:51,278
is called olive drab.

139
00:07:51,278 --> 00:07:54,078
Hey. Have you really ever played

140
00:07:54,078 --> 00:07:55,978
whatever the game that you mentioned just now?

141
00:07:55,978 --> 00:07:58,457
To tell the truth, I'm still a beginner.

142
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:00,778
I guess you can check the place

143
00:08:00,778 --> 00:08:03,178
-where the yard of the apartment was. -What?

144
00:08:03,178 --> 00:08:06,478
Putting together Kaito's words that the Yellow Person

145
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:08,478
was acting suspiciously every night,

146
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:10,478
and the fact that Mr. Makabe is going as far

147
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,473
as to lie about the soil between his fingernails.

148
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:15,978
It seems that Mr. Makabe was digging something out

149
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:19,278
night after night in secret.

150
00:08:19,278 --> 00:08:21,278
So I'm sure that it's buried.

151
00:08:21,278 --> 00:08:25,978
Something very important that he doesn't want anybody to see.

152
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:28,478
Perhaps it's the money

153
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:32,491
that you made from day-trading, am I right?

154
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:34,078
What is it exactly?

155
00:08:38,678 --> 00:08:41,478
There are two briefcases.

156
00:08:41,478 --> 00:08:44,178
The money I made by day-trading.

157
00:08:44,178 --> 00:08:46,505
I think it was about 2 billion yen.

158
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:48,278
That's a lot of cash!

159
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,978
Why did you bury it in the yard?

160
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:53,778
I didn't want to get taxed on it.

161
00:08:53,778 --> 00:08:55,778
But last night,

162
00:08:55,778 --> 00:08:57,678
when I came back from the movies,

163
00:08:57,678 --> 00:09:00,519
the landlord constantly asked me about it.

164
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,521
I was annoyed, so I pushed him away.

165
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:05,278
He fell down the stairs

166
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,178
and he didn't move at all, so I got scared.

167
00:09:09,178 --> 00:09:11,678
I decided that if I burned everything down,

168
00:09:11,678 --> 00:09:13,878
I could reset and start over.

169
00:09:13,878 --> 00:09:15,578
Reset, you said?

170
00:09:15,578 --> 00:09:16,535
Do you understand what you did?

171
00:09:16,778 --> 00:09:18,537
It's not like you can just

172
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:21,978
turn off the switch of a game because you lost!

173
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,578
An apartment that existed for years and all the memories that surrounded it

174
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:28,278
were burnt to ashes in just one night.

175
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:31,178
It's not something you can reset.

176
00:09:31,178 --> 00:09:35,278
Your game of life still has a long way to go!

177
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:38,578
I'll see that you pay for what you did, so ready yourself for it!

178
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,278
-That includes making amends to Kaito... -Yes, all right.

179
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:42,178
and his father who got affected in the case.

180
00:09:42,178 --> 00:09:45,678
Inspector! It's the hospital!

181
00:09:45,678 --> 00:09:47,978
The landlord's surgery is successful,

182
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:50,569
and Kaito seems to have regained consciousness too.

183
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:52,571
Oh, I see.

184
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:54,178
Thank god...

185
00:09:56,878 --> 00:10:00,278
Well, I guess you're going to rebuild the apartment with the money you made

186
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:02,581
from playing money game.

187
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:03,678
Yes, sir.

188
00:10:03,678 --> 00:10:06,078
Let's go.

189
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,078
But there's still one mystery left.

190
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:13,278
Yeah. Why is Conan's nickname Black and White?

191
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:15,678
What kind of car is black and white?

192
00:10:15,678 --> 00:10:19,278
I'm sure that he referred to us, the police.

193
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:21,378
The police car.

194
00:10:21,378 --> 00:10:23,978
It's just the perfect nickname for a boy

195
00:10:23,978 --> 00:10:25,778
who puts the police to shame.

196
00:10:25,778 --> 00:10:27,478
See you, kid.

197
00:10:27,478 --> 00:10:28,607
Sure.

198
00:10:29,878 --> 00:10:34,078
Shall we all go visit Kaito at the hospital now, then?

199
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:35,178
Okay!

200
00:10:35,178 --> 00:10:38,878
Let's have Doc take us there because it's some distance away.

201
00:10:38,878 --> 00:10:40,178
Doc?

202
00:10:41,378 --> 00:10:44,078
You mean you have a doctor you're acquainted with?

203
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:45,578
Yes, we do!

204
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:49,078
All he does is make useless games every time though.

205
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:51,978
Oh. I'd sure like to meet him.

206
00:10:51,978 --> 00:10:53,978
Okay, we'll take you there!

207
00:10:53,978 --> 00:10:55,678
Thanks.

208
00:10:58,178 --> 00:11:00,639
A post-graduate in the engineering department.

209
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,378
So, you eventually plan on getting a Ph.D

210
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:04,643
and become my business rival?

211
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:06,078
No. Of course not.

212
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:08,647
You sure live in a big house.

213
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:10,649
Are you living here with her, just the two of you?

214
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:12,651
-Yeah. -Then,

215
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:13,878
it wouldn't be a problem for you

216
00:11:13,878 --> 00:11:15,678
having another person live here, would it?

217
00:11:15,678 --> 00:11:17,578
Huh?

218
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:20,678
Well, the apartment I used to live in got burned down.

219
00:11:20,678 --> 00:11:23,778
So if it's okay with you, would you let me stay here

220
00:11:23,778 --> 00:11:26,278
until I find a new place to stay?

221
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:27,678
Of course, I'll help you with your research

222
00:11:27,678 --> 00:11:31,378
or assist you in anything during my spare time.

223
00:11:31,378 --> 00:11:33,978
Yeah. I don't mind

224
00:11:33,978 --> 00:11:36,378
as long as she agrees.

225
00:11:37,578 --> 00:11:40,378
Would you like to stay in Shinichi's house then?

226
00:11:40,378 --> 00:11:42,278
Shinichi's house?

227
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:45,178
Yes. No one's living there now.

228
00:11:46,178 --> 00:11:48,378
Look. It's the house next door.

229
00:11:48,378 --> 00:11:50,689
I've got the key to the house.

230
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:54,178
I see. It sure is a fine house, but is it really okay?

231
00:11:54,178 --> 00:11:56,695
-Yes! -Wait a minute.

232
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:58,278
What's on your mind?

233
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:01,078
You don't even know him that well.

234
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:03,778
What are you going to do if he finds out about our secret?

235
00:12:03,778 --> 00:12:05,378
Don't worry.

236
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:10,709
There are no bad people who are fans of Holmes.

237
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:11,878
What?

238
00:12:12,878 --> 00:12:14,713
Here, this is the house key.

239
00:12:14,878 --> 00:12:16,378
Are you sure you don't have to

240
00:12:16,378 --> 00:12:19,178
ask for permission from the person called Shinichi?

241
00:12:19,178 --> 00:12:21,878
Yes! I'll e-mail him later.

242
00:12:21,878 --> 00:12:24,723
Thank you. You've been a great help.

243
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:28,378
But make sure you watch the house nicely.

244
00:12:28,378 --> 00:12:30,729
Yes. Of course.

245
00:12:41,274 --> 00:12:45,474
Gosh. Arsons, abductions, and hit and runs.

246
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:49,574
It's amazing how many different incidents happen one after the other every day.

247
00:12:49,574 --> 00:12:51,774
-How can you be so easygoing? -Huh?

248
00:12:51,774 --> 00:12:54,753
That man that's free-loading at your house.

249
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:59,074
Is it really okay to trust him so easily?

250
00:12:59,074 --> 00:13:01,374
You mean the man called Subaru Okiya?

251
00:13:01,374 --> 00:13:03,274
Don't worry about him!

252
00:13:03,274 --> 00:13:04,763
I sure hope so.

253
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:06,765
I assure you.

254
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:08,474
-Conan! -Huh?

255
00:13:08,474 --> 00:13:10,274
Look out!

256
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:13,674
Sorry, sorry.

257
00:13:13,674 --> 00:13:15,174
Oh, boy.

258
00:13:16,574 --> 00:13:18,777
A paper plane?

259
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:21,874
What's with its design?

260
00:13:21,874 --> 00:13:23,274
Is it the Japanese flag?

261
00:13:23,274 --> 00:13:25,374
Oh, don't you know?

262
00:13:25,374 --> 00:13:28,787
There's an airplane guy that everyone in town is talking about.

263
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,474
During the last two days,

264
00:13:31,474 --> 00:13:36,074
a total of almost 100 paper planes were found all over the city.

265
00:13:36,074 --> 00:13:40,274
It seems that the same pattern was drawn on those airplanes too.

266
00:13:40,274 --> 00:13:44,174
Come to think of it, I saw it on my cell phone news just a while ago too.

267
00:13:44,174 --> 00:13:47,374
Well, I guess it's just some sort of prank,

268
00:13:47,374 --> 00:13:49,474
because they seem to be flown only during the night.

269
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:52,811
It could be the doings of an adult who's stressed out at work.

270
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:56,274
Talking about stress, there's going to be a re-run

271
00:13:56,274 --> 00:13:58,374
of a programme called "Stress Induced Murder".

272
00:13:58,374 --> 00:14:02,574
Oh. You mean the Detective Saimonji Series by Kaori Shinmei.

273
00:14:02,574 --> 00:14:04,574
I wish I could watch it again.

274
00:14:04,574 --> 00:14:07,474
But we won't be able to make it.

275
00:14:07,474 --> 00:14:10,829
The re-run is on today?

276
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:13,674
I couldn't watch the program when it was aired

277
00:14:13,674 --> 00:14:16,274
because Pops was watching Yoko Okino on TV.

278
00:14:16,274 --> 00:14:17,974
Wait a second.

279
00:14:17,974 --> 00:14:19,674
It's exam day today,

280
00:14:19,674 --> 00:14:22,841
so Ran will only have class in the morning.

281
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:25,274
I guess I'll ask her to record the program for me.

282
00:14:25,274 --> 00:14:26,574
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Huh?

283
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,847
Ran's not home yet.

284
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:31,574
She said she'd be late today.

285
00:14:31,574 --> 00:14:32,851
Huh, how come?

286
00:14:33,074 --> 00:14:37,274
She said that she was going to go clean up the detective kid's house.

287
00:14:37,274 --> 00:14:41,774
That busybody is doing unnecessary stuff again.

288
00:14:41,774 --> 00:14:44,863
I wonder if I could ask you to do me a favour, Pops?

289
00:14:45,074 --> 00:14:47,674
What? I'm not giving you allowance.

290
00:14:47,674 --> 00:14:50,474
No, it's nothing like that.

291
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:51,974
Wait a second.

292
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,873
Oh, no! Over there right now...

293
00:14:54,873 --> 00:14:57,274
If it's not that, what is it?

294
00:14:57,274 --> 00:14:58,877
-Hey, Conan! -It's been reported...

295
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:01,374
-Really. What's with him? -That the kidnapper jumped off the roof

296
00:15:01,374 --> 00:15:03,174
of that building while on the run.

297
00:15:03,174 --> 00:15:07,474
The whereabout of the president who has been abducted remains unknown.

298
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,889
But how surprising.

299
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:14,893
The klutz is going to study in the States.

300
00:15:15,074 --> 00:15:18,897
I mean, he came back to school and all. It was so sudden.

301
00:15:19,074 --> 00:15:21,874
I wonder how Eisuke's doing.

302
00:15:21,874 --> 00:15:24,903
-Speaking of which... -Huh?

303
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:27,274
How's Shinichi doing?

304
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:29,774
Is he not coming back yet?

305
00:15:29,774 --> 00:15:31,574
No.

306
00:15:31,574 --> 00:15:34,174
Waiting for Shinichi who's still not coming back,

307
00:15:34,174 --> 00:15:37,774
Ran skitters off to go and clean his place again today.

308
00:15:37,774 --> 00:15:41,174
I'm not skittering off anywhere.

309
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:45,674
But it seems like it's become a custom to come

310
00:15:45,674 --> 00:15:47,974
and clean Shinichi's place once a month, don't you think?

311
00:15:47,974 --> 00:15:50,574
Well, not really.

312
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:53,974
I told you about the delicious sandwich shop, didn't I?

313
00:15:53,974 --> 00:15:56,935
That was really good, but...

314
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:59,474
I don't see why you have to go out of your way to take care

315
00:15:59,474 --> 00:16:01,474
of that deduction freak who rarely even contacts you.

316
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:05,274
Come on. He seems to be going through a lot too.

317
00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:09,274
Wait.

318
00:16:09,274 --> 00:16:11,574
What's the matter?

319
00:16:11,574 --> 00:16:14,974
Hey, isn't it kind of cool in here?

320
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,955
Like the air conditioner's on or something.

321
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:18,957
Now that you mentioned it, I think it is.

322
00:16:19,174 --> 00:16:21,374
Shinichi?

323
00:16:21,374 --> 00:16:23,374
Shinichi's back.

324
00:16:25,174 --> 00:16:26,474
Shinichi!

325
00:16:27,474 --> 00:16:29,974
Where are you, Shinichi?

326
00:16:32,474 --> 00:16:35,674
You're here, aren't you? Answer me!

327
00:16:35,674 --> 00:16:37,574
Shinichi!

328
00:16:40,674 --> 00:16:44,074
There he is. In the restroom.

329
00:16:44,074 --> 00:16:46,985
I tell you. If you were coming home,

330
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:48,987
why didn't you tell me?

331
00:16:54,174 --> 00:16:56,995
Who are you?

332
00:16:56,995 --> 00:16:58,674
Well...

333
00:16:58,674 --> 00:17:00,999
Don't tell me that he's a thief?

334
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:03,274
Sonoko, stand back.

335
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:04,674
I mean...

336
00:17:12,274 --> 00:17:13,674
Serves you right!

337
00:17:13,674 --> 00:17:16,274
Ran, hurry and call the police.

338
00:17:16,274 --> 00:17:18,274
Ran?

339
00:17:18,274 --> 00:17:21,274
He didn't resist.

340
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:23,574
Who is he?

341
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:29,874
What? A university student who's been staying here from last week?

342
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:31,674
Is that true, Conan?

343
00:17:31,674 --> 00:17:34,574
Yes. Didn't I tell you about it the other day?

344
00:17:34,574 --> 00:17:36,374
The apartment that my friend's father owned

345
00:17:36,374 --> 00:17:38,274
was burned down in a fire.

346
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:39,974
He used to be one of the residents there.

347
00:17:39,974 --> 00:17:42,074
His name is Mr. Subaru Okiya.

348
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:44,374
Does Shinichi know about it?

349
00:17:44,374 --> 00:17:48,174
Yes. I sent him an e-mail about it and he wrote back to me.

350
00:17:48,174 --> 00:17:50,074
He said he doesn't mind letting him stay,

351
00:17:50,074 --> 00:17:55,053
but he doesn't want you to talk too much about Shinichi in front of him.

352
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:56,574
Huh? Why not?

353
00:17:56,574 --> 00:18:00,074
Because he doesn't want the man to become too interested

354
00:18:00,074 --> 00:18:01,474
and start snooping around the house.

355
00:18:01,474 --> 00:18:03,074
I see.

356
00:18:03,074 --> 00:18:05,874
-Okay, everyone. Take your seats. -The teacher's here.

357
00:18:05,874 --> 00:18:07,065
Bye.

358
00:18:08,574 --> 00:18:09,874
Wait.

359
00:18:11,074 --> 00:18:13,474
So that's the story.

360
00:18:13,474 --> 00:18:15,874
-We're very sorry! -We're very sorry!

361
00:18:15,874 --> 00:18:19,077
I'm sorry to have struck a kick at you without asking you for details first.

362
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:20,474
That's right, Ran.

363
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:23,374
Someone this handsome could never be a thief.

364
00:18:23,374 --> 00:18:24,574
What?

365
00:18:24,574 --> 00:18:29,087
You even said, "Serves you right" just now.

366
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:34,274
Well. I'm also at fault for not explaining things right away.

367
00:18:34,274 --> 00:18:35,774
By the way, Mr. Okiya,

368
00:18:35,774 --> 00:18:37,974
which university do you go to?

369
00:18:37,974 --> 00:18:40,774
I belong to the department of engineering at Toto University.

370
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,874
He's not only handsome, but is an elite as well.

371
00:18:42,874 --> 00:18:45,774
May I take a picture of you with my cell phone?

372
00:18:45,774 --> 00:18:47,874
And I'd like to know your email address too.

373
00:18:47,874 --> 00:18:49,374
Sure.

374
00:18:49,374 --> 00:18:52,474
I'm going to tell Mr. Kyogyoku about it.

375
00:18:52,474 --> 00:18:54,774
I'll just take a picture then.

376
00:18:54,774 --> 00:18:57,874
Before that, may I go and buy something?

377
00:18:57,874 --> 00:19:00,874
I haven't eaten anything since this morning.

378
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:03,874
Then I'll go get you something as a token of my apology.

379
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:06,274
Okay, then.

380
00:19:06,274 --> 00:19:08,074
Could you get me what you were eating a while ago?

381
00:19:08,074 --> 00:19:11,129
At Welcome Burger.

382
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:14,874
Did we mention stopping over at Welcome Burger?

383
00:19:14,874 --> 00:19:17,474
No. It's something really simple.

384
00:19:17,474 --> 00:19:20,074
You, the girl with brown hair caught my attention.

385
00:19:20,074 --> 00:19:22,874
When you thought I was a thief,

386
00:19:22,874 --> 00:19:25,774
you blew your top at me and called me names.

387
00:19:25,774 --> 00:19:27,974
But once you found out that I'm not a thief,

388
00:19:27,974 --> 00:19:29,874
you pulled away from me

389
00:19:29,874 --> 00:19:33,151
and hid behind this girl with long hair.

390
00:19:33,374 --> 00:19:35,153
Normally, it should be the other way around.

391
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:40,874
I take it that you took a liking to me as the opposite sex,

392
00:19:40,874 --> 00:19:45,163
and didn't want me to smell your bad breath.

393
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:47,474
In other words, it made me think that you might have eaten

394
00:19:47,474 --> 00:19:52,174
the garlic sandwich that newly came out.

395
00:19:52,174 --> 00:19:54,174
Wow!

396
00:19:54,174 --> 00:19:56,874
But there are other food with garlic too.

397
00:19:56,874 --> 00:19:59,874
I could tell from the way she held her cell phone just now.

398
00:19:59,874 --> 00:20:00,874
-Huh? -Huh?

399
00:20:00,874 --> 00:20:04,174
She deliberately used her ring finger when operating the cell phone.

400
00:20:04,174 --> 00:20:05,974
There's probably some oil

401
00:20:05,974 --> 00:20:09,574
left on her thumb, index finger and middle finger

402
00:20:09,574 --> 00:20:11,674
after she ate the French fries.

403
00:20:11,674 --> 00:20:14,574
Besides, there's a little bit of salt left

404
00:20:14,574 --> 00:20:18,274
around your mouth too, long-haired girl.

405
00:20:18,274 --> 00:20:19,197
I'm sorry.

406
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:21,199
Excuse us while we go to the restroom.

407
00:20:23,674 --> 00:20:28,274
Who is he? He seems really smart.

408
00:20:28,274 --> 00:20:29,574
Yes,

409
00:20:29,574 --> 00:20:33,674
but maybe I've met him somewhere before.

410
00:20:33,674 --> 00:20:36,874
He sort of looks familiar.

411
00:20:36,874 --> 00:20:40,874
He must have reminded you of your hubby, Shinichi.

412
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:43,674
I mean, Subaru is just like a detective too.

413
00:20:43,674 --> 00:20:45,974
No, they don't resemble each other.

414
00:20:45,974 --> 00:20:48,074
Besides, Shinichi's not my hubby.

415
00:20:48,074 --> 00:20:50,074
Well, as I see it,

416
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:54,574
Subaru is a cut above Shinichi when it comes to being a detective.

417
00:20:54,574 --> 00:20:55,974
Do you think so?

418
00:20:55,974 --> 00:21:00,274
But it's not that Shinichi's not good either.

419
00:21:00,274 --> 00:21:02,074
Would you like to see them have a match then?

420
00:21:02,074 --> 00:21:04,174
Subaru against Shinichi.

421
00:21:06,674 --> 00:21:10,074
We're going to study the names of flowers today!

422
00:21:12,274 --> 00:21:14,874
A mail? It's from Ran.

423
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,974
"You'll be able to solve the case

424
00:21:16,974 --> 00:21:19,257
that's being talked about right now, won't you, Shinichi?"

425
00:21:19,257 --> 00:21:21,259
I've got images of the actual thing I'm talking about,

426
00:21:21,474 --> 00:21:23,261
so I'll send them to you.

427
00:21:24,774 --> 00:21:26,274
What's this?

428
00:21:26,274 --> 00:21:29,674
Isn't it the paper plane that Genta was flying this morning?

429
00:21:29,674 --> 00:21:33,271
But the pattern's a bit different from Genta's.

430
00:21:34,474 --> 00:21:36,174
There's another image.

431
00:21:39,274 --> 00:21:41,874
Hey. Could this be...

432
00:21:43,674 --> 00:21:46,074
So this was found in the yard of your house.

433
00:21:46,074 --> 00:21:48,374
That's why I want to know

434
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:52,774
who the prankster is and why he flew paper planes like this.

435
00:21:54,374 --> 00:21:56,074
I see.

436
00:21:56,074 --> 00:21:58,174
This is an interesting code.

437
00:21:58,174 --> 00:22:01,299
Don't tell me you've already figured it out?

438
00:22:02,474 --> 00:22:04,674
It's here.

439
00:22:04,674 --> 00:22:08,274
The mail from Shinichi. That was fast.

440
00:22:08,274 --> 00:22:13,311
It's most likely that this paper plane is an SOS signal.

441
00:22:13,311 --> 00:22:15,313
What? SOS signal?

442
00:22:15,313 --> 00:22:17,974
Are you saying that someone's asking for help?

443
00:22:17,974 --> 00:22:19,074
Right.

444
00:22:19,074 --> 00:22:23,074
Moreover, the situation requires immediate action.

445
00:22:23,074 --> 00:22:26,574
If you have an image of another paper plane...

446
00:22:26,574 --> 00:22:29,327
The image of another paper plane...

447
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:31,974
I would like you to show it to me right now.

448
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,144
Next Conan's Hint:

449
00:24:04,144 --> 00:24:05,423
"Squid"

450
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,900
Pudding is better than octopus.

451
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,840
-Why? -I can't tell you.
