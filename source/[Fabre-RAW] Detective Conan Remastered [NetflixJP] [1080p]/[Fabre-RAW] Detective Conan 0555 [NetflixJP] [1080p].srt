Ran's whereabouts became unknown at Kinosaki hot spring

"Koichi Yumoto (28), Freelance Writer"

4
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:11,991
From the pictures that Mitsuhiko and the others took,

5
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:16,260
we were able to figure out that Ran was accompanying a little girl.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,860
In that same picture, there was a silhouette of

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,001
a suspicious looking figure following their tracks too.

8
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,003
We are told by Heiji Hattori who we coincidentally run into

9
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:26,460
that the girl is Haruna Tabuse

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,160
that he had been asked to search for.

The day before, a sculpture called...

13
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,060
"Shuhei Tabuse (42)" -the "Rainbow Child" was stolen

14
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,360
from the art museum that Haruna's father owns,

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,660
and Haruna disappeared along with it.

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,025
We learn from Dolphin Trainer Yui, an acquaintance of Haruna,

17
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:48,860
that the sculptor of the "Rainbow Child"

18
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,031
is actually Haruna's mother who is living apart from her now.

19
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:54,033
Using the letter from her mother as a clue,

20
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:56,460
we pursued our search for the two girls.

21
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,060
But, at about the same time...

nor was the suspicious man found.

36
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:39,029
Sorry, Ran.

37
00:03:39,029 --> 00:03:41,629
If I could only move the way I wanted to...

38
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:44,203
We went to the police over here just in case.

39
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:46,929
Mr. Tabuse and the others went to the hospital.

40
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:48,229
I see.

41
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:49,629
I'm sorry this happened despite me being there.

42
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:53,829
Don't be. I should've realized earlier myself.

43
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:56,215
The reason Haruna didn't go to

44
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:58,829
the Kinosaki Literary Art Museum was probably

45
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:01,729
because of the letter from her mother that had written,

46
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:05,729
"I ran into my best friend at Kinosaki Literary Art Museum,"

47
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:08,829
but she couldn't read the words "Kinosaki Literary Art Museum".

48
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:11,829
But she was able to read the word "straw".

49
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:13,029
So she used that as a hint

50
00:04:13,029 --> 00:04:16,229
and headed for the Kinosaki Traditional Straw Craft Museum.

51
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:19,229
She went to the ropeway station at the top of the mountain

52
00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:21,229
for the same reason too.

53
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:23,529
Haruna could only read the word "station"

54
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,829
of the "Kinosaki Hot Spring Station" that was written.

55
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:29,129
So she put the work "mountain" that was written nearby together,

56
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:31,929
and thought it read mountain top station.

57
00:04:31,929 --> 00:04:34,253
We were staking out at Kinosaki Hot Spring Station,

58
00:04:34,429 --> 00:04:37,729
so were late getting to the mountain top station.

59
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:42,029
I tell you children do things that you can't figure out.

60
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:46,029
Heiji, nothing was in Haruna's knapsack was there?

61
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:48,629
No, but it's hard to believe that

62
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:50,829
the culprit got hold of the "Rainbow Child" either.

63
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:54,273
Yeah. If so, he wouldn't have had to kidnap Ran.

64
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:58,277
Haruna probably hid the "Rainbow Child" somewhere.

65
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:01,529
So, it's most likely that Haruna's the one

66
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:04,283
who took the "Rainbow Child" from the museum.

67
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:07,729
"Toyooka Central Hospital"

68

What brings you here?

70
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:18,297
I'm good friends with the hospital head here,

71
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:19,929
so he let me know.

72
00:05:19,929 --> 00:05:21,529
How's Haruna?

73
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:24,729
I took the "Rainbow Child"?

74
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:26,305
Don't be ridiculous!

75
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:28,307
I would never do something like that!

76
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:30,309
Please be quiet.

77
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:33,129
This is a hospital, you know.

78
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:37,829
Where were you all this time?

79
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:39,629
At Michiko's...

80
00:05:40,929 --> 00:05:42,129
Mother.

81
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:45,029
At any rate, I want the "Rainbow Child" back!

82
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:47,429
That belongs to our art museum!

83
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:50,729
I just told you I didn't take it!

84
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:52,629
Please cut it out!

85
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:55,929
Shut up! It's none of your business!

86
00:05:55,929 --> 00:05:57,329
It sure is my business!

87
00:05:57,329 --> 00:06:00,829
My daughter got messed up in this too, you know?

88
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:02,341
Just what do you mean?

89
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:05,929
Would you tell me a little about what happened?

90
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:10,129
It can't be...

91
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:14,929
Shoots!

92
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:24,363
Please! Wait, Haruna!

93
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:26,629
Gee, you still insist on following me?

94
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:29,029
I switched off the phone like you told me too,

95
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:31,229
and won't tell anybody about you.

96
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:32,929
I'll take you home,

97
00:06:32,929 --> 00:06:35,629
so let's go home to where your mom and dad are.

98
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:38,377
There's nobody at home.

99
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:39,529
Huh?

100
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:43,129
Mother got divorced and left leaving me behind!

101
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:47,829
Dad is all work day after day too

102
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:50,729
and probably doesn't care at all about me.

103
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:53,429
I see. As for me,

104
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:56,395
my mother and father has been living away from each other

105
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:59,129
-since I was little, you see. -Huh?

106
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:04,029
I think I kind of understand a little of how you feel, Haruna.

107
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:06,029
So...

108
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:08,407
So, if you don't do as I say,

109
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,929
this lady here is going to get it.

110
00:07:12,429 --> 00:07:13,829
Ran.

111
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:20,129
Bingo! Haruna's moving!

112
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:24,129
Okay! Heiji, I'm counting on you, so don't lose her!

113
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:27,529
If the culprit kidnapped Ran

114
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:29,929
because he couldn't get hold of the "Rainbow Child",

115
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:33,229
Haruna will sure move just as the culprit tells her to!

116
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:35,229
Just as we deduced!

117
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:39,829
She seems to have seen us!

118
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:41,329
Driver.

119
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:55,829
It's starting to look like work for we,

120
00:07:55,829 --> 00:07:57,729
the Youth Detective Squad, isn't it?

121
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:00,459
We'll rescue Ran!

122
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:04,463
Huh?

123
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:06,829
My badge is gone! I don't have it!

124
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:08,729
Maybe you dropped it at the hot spring?

125
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:10,469
What? Oh, no!

126
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:16,229
Somebody... Somebody help me!

127
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:27,929
This... Ayumi dropped it.

128
00:08:27,929 --> 00:08:29,629
The Youth Detective Squad badge.

129
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,729
-My badge... -Who is it from?

130
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:37,329
It's Conan?

131
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:39,229
Maybe it's my badge?

132
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:43,029
Wait!

133
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:44,503
I hear something.

134
00:08:44,729 --> 00:08:47,629
The sound of drums is heard from the badge?

135
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:50,509
Maybe it's Ran.

136
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:53,129
Right! If I remember correctly...

137
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:59,129
13:00... This is it!

138
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:00,929
Mirage!

139
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:04,523
"Mirage" -They sound the drums to tell time at 13:00!

140
00:09:04,729 --> 00:09:08,229
Ran is probably in Izushi!

141
00:09:08,229 --> 00:09:10,129
"Izushi"

142
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:56,129
Mother and child stone statue?

143
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,029
Haruna went to pray there?

144
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:01,529
Yeah, I don't know what you really call it,

145
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:03,729
but it's a shabby looking old stone statue

146
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:07,129
and it's carrying a baby in its arms.

147
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:09,029
At Kinosaki, Haruna was praying to

148
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:10,589
the goddess of child birth and children.

149
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:16,929
And at the mountain top ropeway station

150
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:19,029
is the Benevolent Mother Guyanin.

151
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:22,629
And this time, it's the stone statue of mother and child.

152
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:24,603
Could it be that...

153
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:30,129
It seems that you're thinking the same thing I am too, Kudo.

154
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:34,229
Yeah. Then Haruna's purpose is...

155
00:10:34,229 --> 00:10:36,615
Just what're they talking about?

156
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:41,429
"Sukyo Temple"

157
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:47,329
"Izushi Meiji Museum"

158

"Izushi Chief Retainer's House"

159
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:01,429
"Playhouse"

160
00:11:10,229 --> 00:11:11,229
Shoots!

161
00:11:11,229 --> 00:11:13,229
-Go around the back! -Okay!

162
00:11:13,229 --> 00:11:14,929
You lost her?

163
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:17,929
What? Just what do you guys think you're doing?

164
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:20,129
Pops, calm down!

165
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:27,529
Those stone stairs were really tough as expected, weren't they?

166
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:28,667
Really!

167
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:31,229
My calves are all swollen.

168
00:11:31,229 --> 00:11:33,829
I wonder how many steps those stairs have?

169
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:35,329
Hey, look, look.

170
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:39,729
It says the place we just went to is called "Gonbei-san"!

171
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:41,029
Gonbei?

172
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:42,681
How interesting.

173
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:43,929
Gonbei-san?

174
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:46,685
What is it? Do you hear something?

175
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:50,129
Do you want to go to Gonbei-san?

176
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:53,629
-Driver, do you know Gonbei-san? -Yes.

177
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,695
-Please take us there! -Sure.

178
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:59,229
Ran, hang on!

179
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:06,705
I see! This is it!

180
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:10,709
I've finally figured out the truth of this case!

181
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:19,266
"Izushi Castle Ruins"

182
00:12:19,266 --> 00:12:20,466
I can't go any farther.

183
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:22,166
I'm starved and can't move.

184
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,723
You two are have no guts!

185
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:29,366
"Kannoden"

186
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:32,731
This is Kannoden!

187
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:36,735
Why is this called Gonbei-san?

188
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:39,166
That's because this Kannoden is dedicated to

189
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:44,743
an ancient Izushi feudal lord named Gonbei Hidehisa.

190
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:46,366
That's why it's called Gonbei-san.

191
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:49,866
Maybe that detective agency daughter is somewhere nearby.

192
00:12:52,966 --> 00:12:54,753
Shoots!

193
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:00,066
What's with her?

194
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:01,566
It's those women again?

195
00:13:01,566 --> 00:13:03,066
What is it?

196
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:06,765
Move out of the way, please!

197
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:08,366
-Move out of the way! -Just what do you think you're doing?

198
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:13,966
Get in!

199
00:13:13,966 --> 00:13:16,566
-Where's Ran? -Hurry!

200
00:13:23,866 --> 00:13:26,466
He got away!

201
00:13:26,466 --> 00:13:28,466
After that car!

202
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,766
Move! Move out of the way, please!

203
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:39,166
I've got no choice but to go!

204
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:43,366
Hey!

205
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:46,805
I won't let you get away!

206
00:13:50,266 --> 00:13:52,266
Where's the brat...

207
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:11,466
Where'd he go?

208
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:25,766
"Michiko Sagara (35), straw craft craftsman"

209
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,366
Aunty!

210
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:30,849
Haruna?

211
00:14:31,066 --> 00:14:32,066
Aunty!

212
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:34,366
You've got the thing that mother asked you to keep for her, right?

213
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:36,566
From Natsuho?

214
00:14:36,566 --> 00:14:38,466
You mean this?

215
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,566
I finally found it!

216
00:14:50,566 --> 00:14:53,566
-Were you looking for this? -Yep!

217
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,866
What's that?

218
00:14:56,866 --> 00:14:59,466
I told you to take me where the "Rainbow Child" was!

219
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,166
Just who are you?

220
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,666
You can't separate them!

221
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:04,666
If you're going to take it away,

222
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,885
I want you to take this one with it, too!

223
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:08,166
What is she talking about?

224
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,466
Exactly what she just said.

225
00:15:11,966 --> 00:15:13,866
You're...

226
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:16,895
Haruna, you were looking for it all this time, weren't you?

227
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:20,899
I'll bet it's a pair with the "Rainbow Child" statue?

228
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:24,066
Who are you?

229
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:26,066
Conan Edogawa.

230
00:15:26,066 --> 00:15:27,666
A detective.

231
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:31,566
A detective? You've gotta be kidding!

232
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:33,466
Michiko, I'm taking a break...

233
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:34,913
Yui!

234
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:46,366
Wait!

235
00:15:51,266 --> 00:15:54,066
I finally found you!

236
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:55,866
Sorry, we took a while.

237
00:15:55,866 --> 00:15:57,966
Ran, are you okay?

238
00:15:57,966 --> 00:16:00,366
Darn it! Let me go!

239
00:16:01,366 --> 00:16:05,366
Let go! You brat! Let me go!

240
00:16:05,366 --> 00:16:06,966
Conan!

241
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,966
Darn it!

242
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:08,947
Oh no!

243
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:10,949
Hold it!

244
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,266
Are you all right, Conan?

245
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:28,266
Yep. Ran, how about you?

246
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:29,966
Yep, I'm fine!

247
00:16:29,966 --> 00:16:31,266
I guess you are.

248
00:16:31,266 --> 00:16:34,066
Ran...

249
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:35,266
Dad!

250
00:16:35,266 --> 00:16:38,166
Ran! Are you all right? You're not hurt, are you?

251
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,466
Yep.

252
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:42,266
I'm glad! I'm really glad!

253
00:16:42,266 --> 00:16:44,066
Dad.

254
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:47,266
Don't cry.

255
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:49,366
What's going on?

256
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:51,566
Ko-chan?

257
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,995
Ko-chan, just what do you think you're doing?

258
00:16:57,166 --> 00:17:00,066
I mean, I was looking for you all this time!

259
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:02,766
Hey! Say something, will you?

260
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:05,466
Ko-chan...

261
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:09,007
I'm very sorry!

262
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:11,009
I'm sorry for trouble he caused!

263
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:13,011
You're so stupid!

264
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:14,166
How can you do something like this,

265
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,566
be it that you have to pay back debts!

266
00:17:15,566 --> 00:17:17,466
I'm sorry, Yui.

267
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:19,966
He may be stupid, but he's not a bad guy!

268
00:17:19,966 --> 00:17:25,023
So, please let him go, just this time! Please!

269
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:28,466
Why'd you do something like this?

270
00:17:28,466 --> 00:17:30,366
The fact is, I was asked to do this.

271
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:34,266
Mr. Mouri refused to let me have a close up interview with him,

272
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:36,566
and I was at a loss what to do.

273
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:42,666
That person you're talking about, isn't it Mr. Kamaike?

274
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,043
Huh? How do you know?

275
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:48,366
Mr. Kamaike? You mean the head of the museum?

276
00:17:49,466 --> 00:17:53,466
Isn't it about time you come out? Mr. Kamaike!

277
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:57,055
I don't know what you're talking about.

278
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:58,766
Mr. Kamaike!

279
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:03,666
I had Mr. Yumoto write an article about the museum.

280
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,466
But I just happened to pass by here.

281
00:18:06,466 --> 00:18:07,866
Mr. Kamaike.

282
00:18:07,866 --> 00:18:11,466
The man in this picture isn't Mr. Yumoto!

283
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:15,466
Because Mr. Yumoto was doing a close up interview of Pops at that time.

284
00:18:15,466 --> 00:18:17,075
This is you, right?

285
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:20,366
Stop making ridiculous stories up!

286
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:23,866
Mr. Kamaike, I'll bet you knew about it

287
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:26,266
from the materials in the reference museum or something.

288
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:27,666
That there was a statue of a mother

289
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:30,066
that was to paired with the "Rainbow Child."

290
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:33,091
And, also that Haruna was trying to bring together

291
00:18:33,266 --> 00:18:35,666
the "Rainbow Child" statue with that of the mother statue.

292
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,466
So you deliberately made it easy for her to steal the statue

293
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:39,566
when you re-decorated the exhibited items.

294
00:18:39,566 --> 00:18:43,101
You lured Haruna into stealing the "Rainbow Child" statue.

295
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:45,366
Then you followed Haruna

296
00:18:45,366 --> 00:18:49,766
and found the statue of the mother.

297
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:55,766
But when Pops came together with Heiji,

298
00:18:55,766 --> 00:18:57,666
you got flustered, right?

299
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,117
So, he tried to get you, Mr. Yumoto

300
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:01,866
to at least get a hold of the "Rainbow Children".

301
00:19:01,866 --> 00:19:07,125
Right! But Haruna didn't have the "Rainbow Child".

302
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,666
And that's why I kidnapped that girl.

303
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:13,666
Will you cut it out?

304
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,566
Or, do you have some kind of evidence or something?

305
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:18,566
What's that stain on your slacks?

306
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:22,466
What about this?

307
00:19:22,466 --> 00:19:26,566
Genta, you bumped into the man wearing sunglasses, right?

308
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:27,666
Yeah.

309
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,966
He's the one who spoiled my crab ice!

310
00:19:29,966 --> 00:19:32,766
What about it?

311
00:19:32,766 --> 00:19:35,966
Mitsuhiko, your badge is so dirty

312
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:39,166
Yeah, the ice melted and spilled.

313
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,666
That stain, maybe it's...

314
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,466
What?

315
00:19:46,466 --> 00:19:49,167
That's indeed the smell of my crab ice!

316
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,171
Perfect match!

317
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:54,366
In other words, it means that

318
00:19:54,366 --> 00:19:57,866
you're the man wearing sunglasses that bumped into him!

319
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,666
Admit it already.

320
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:06,766
I embezzled money from the art museum and used it.

321
00:20:06,766 --> 00:20:09,566
So I was planning to sell off the "Rainbow Child"

322
00:20:09,566 --> 00:20:11,666
and the "Mother" statue that was still not made public

323
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,666
and get rid of the deficit!

324
00:20:18,066 --> 00:20:19,666
The "Rainbow Child" statue was hidden

325
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,166
in the coin locker of Kinosaki Hot Spring Station

326
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:25,766
from the time Haruna had come to Kinosaki.

327
00:20:30,266 --> 00:20:32,266
How nice!

328
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:33,966
It's fantastic!

329
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,866
You can say that again.

330
00:20:42,566 --> 00:20:44,766
-How splendid! -Yep!

331
00:20:44,766 --> 00:20:45,966
You go and tell her things you don't have to,

332
00:20:45,966 --> 00:20:47,225
that's why she ends up doing something like this!

333
00:20:47,466 --> 00:20:48,666
Speak for yourself.

334
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,466
You don't take care of her like you should, that's why...

335
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:53,566
What? You're to blame for leaving home capriciously!

336
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:56,466
That's because you never listen to what I have to say!

337
00:20:56,466 --> 00:20:58,966
Please stop!

338
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,866
Don't you still see

339
00:21:00,866 --> 00:21:04,666
why Haruna took the "Rainbow Child"?

340
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,245
She was lonely

341
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,247
because she was living away from her mother

342
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,166
and her father was busy with work everyday.

343
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,866
That's why she thought that by bringing the two statues together,

344
00:21:14,866 --> 00:21:18,466
she could maybe bring her separated family back together again.

345
00:21:18,466 --> 00:21:19,566
That's what she was thinking

346
00:21:19,566 --> 00:21:22,166
while carrying the "Rainbow Child" around!

347
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,766
It's almost like...

348
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:28,766
Almost like a stork that brings along happiness.

349
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:32,766
Mommy! Daddy!

350
00:21:32,766 --> 00:21:34,366
Haruna!

351
00:21:35,266 --> 00:21:36,766
Haruna!

352
00:21:36,766 --> 00:21:39,066
I'm sorry, Haruna!

353
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:41,279
Haruna!

354
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,666
Mommy...

355
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,566
Mommy!

356
00:21:48,466 --> 00:21:52,666
Haruna, I'm sorry!

357
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,566
Daddy!

358
00:21:54,566 --> 00:21:57,295
Daddy! Mommy!

359
00:21:57,295 --> 00:21:59,297
Haruna.

360
00:23:26,366 --> 00:23:29,387
"Misato Park of the Storks"

361
00:23:35,393 --> 00:23:38,466
Hey, look! Daddy! Mommy!

362
00:23:38,466 --> 00:23:41,666
They are so many of them!

363
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:45,066
I wish we'd be like that one day, too.

364
00:23:50,566 --> 00:23:52,366
They're flying off!

365
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,198
Next Conan's Hint:

366
00:24:04,198 --> 00:24:05,423
"Rainbow"
