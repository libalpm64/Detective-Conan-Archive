1
00:00:01,464 --> 00:00:02,864
Trump!

2
00:00:03,964 --> 00:00:06,064
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:06,064 --> 00:00:07,564
The presence of the Black Organization is uncomfortably felt.

4
00:00:07,564 --> 00:00:08,864
Solve the mystery of the shiny hammer,

5
00:00:08,864 --> 00:00:10,464
and bring the case out in the light!

6
00:00:10,464 --> 00:00:11,764
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,764 --> 00:00:13,364
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,364 --> 00:00:15,364
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,585 --> 00:02:01,685
A father and son comes to the Mouri Detective Agency.

10
00:02:01,685 --> 00:02:05,285
The son, Takumi, witnessed a body being thrown into the Teimusu River

11
00:02:05,285 --> 00:02:08,385
from the bridge on the way to visit a shrine on New Year's day.

12
00:02:10,585 --> 00:02:14,085
Moreover, he said that there's nail drawing on the arm of the culprit.

13
00:02:14,085 --> 00:02:17,685
He also mentioned that he saw a big shiny hammer near the site.

14
00:02:22,885 --> 00:02:26,085
And the dead body of a popular musician

15
00:02:26,085 --> 00:02:28,585
named Roku Itagaki is found in the river.

16
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:37,085
"The Shadow of the Black Organization: Queer Lightning"

17
00:02:37,585 --> 00:02:40,085
This is the New Haido Bridge.

18
00:02:40,085 --> 00:02:42,785
The bridge on the other side of this bridge is Central Haido Bridge.

19
00:02:42,785 --> 00:02:46,185
And the one beyond it is Big Haido Bridge.

20
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:49,885
How about it, Takumi?

21
00:02:49,885 --> 00:02:51,085
Do you remember anything?

22
00:02:51,085 --> 00:02:52,385
Nope.

23
00:02:52,385 --> 00:02:55,085
You can at least tell us

24
00:02:55,085 --> 00:02:57,685
where the guy who threw the bag with the body inside was, right?

25
00:02:57,685 --> 00:02:59,485
I don't remember.

26
00:03:00,785 --> 00:03:04,385
Did you see fireworks behind him, then?

27
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:07,685
If I'm not mistaken, that firework...

28
00:03:10,885 --> 00:03:13,385
was supposed to have been shot up from this side,

29
00:03:13,385 --> 00:03:16,085
so I thought that he could tell us where the fireworks went up.

30
00:03:16,085 --> 00:03:19,485
We could tell which side the suspicious man was.

31
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:21,185
How about it, Takumi?

32
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:24,585
Fireworks?

33
00:03:24,585 --> 00:03:26,085
I see!

34
00:03:26,085 --> 00:03:28,085
Maybe...

35
00:03:28,085 --> 00:03:30,585
The big hammer that Takumi saw

36
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,885
was the fireworks reflected on the surface of the water?

37
00:03:32,885 --> 00:03:36,085
-Huh? -You know,

38
00:03:36,085 --> 00:03:39,185
when fireworks go up, they create a tail of light

39
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:41,885
and that probably looked like the handle of a hammer to you.

40
00:03:41,885 --> 00:03:44,085
But...

41
00:03:44,085 --> 00:03:46,885
Then it's not the tip of a hammer.

42
00:03:46,885 --> 00:03:50,685
The most fireworks would look like is a tadpole,

43
00:03:50,685 --> 00:03:52,085
and even if it disperses,

44
00:03:52,085 --> 00:03:54,685
it would look more like a frying pan than a hammer, wouldn't it?

45
00:03:54,685 --> 00:03:55,885
I see.

46
00:03:55,885 --> 00:03:57,385
Hey.

47
00:03:57,385 --> 00:03:59,585
I didn't see any fireworks.

48
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:01,985
I heard the sound but I couldn't see it.

49
00:04:01,985 --> 00:04:03,785
Which means the suspicious guy

50
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,985
was on the side where the fireworks didn't go up?

51
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:11,885
I hate to butt in, but I wouldn't be too sure about that.

52
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,485
Huh?

53
00:04:13,485 --> 00:04:15,385
That day,

54
00:04:15,385 --> 00:04:18,285
Takumi was sitting in the backseat,

55
00:04:18,285 --> 00:04:19,885
but both lanes were crowded.

56
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,685
I was in the center lane.

57
00:04:22,685 --> 00:04:24,785
So the window of my car was blocked by the car next to us.

58
00:04:24,785 --> 00:04:27,485
That's why he may have been at an angle where he couldn't see it.

59
00:04:29,785 --> 00:04:33,385
I guess we'll have to go on to the next bridge then.

60
00:04:34,985 --> 00:04:37,185
This is the Central Haido Bridge,

61
00:04:37,185 --> 00:04:38,985
which is in the center of the two other bridges.

62
00:04:41,685 --> 00:04:43,685
Anything that comes to mind is a clue.

63
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:54,185
Yes, yes.

64
00:04:56,285 --> 00:04:57,785
Hello.

65
00:04:57,785 --> 00:04:59,685
Sonoko. What?

66
00:04:59,685 --> 00:05:01,285
Ran, did you hear about it?

67
00:05:01,285 --> 00:05:02,285
About what?

68
00:05:02,285 --> 00:05:04,585
What? What do you mean by that?

69
00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:07,385
Roku! Roku died!

70
00:05:07,385 --> 00:05:11,185
Yes, I saw it on the news a while ago.

71
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,885
It seems he can't remember for now,

72
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:16,485
so shall we keep the shiny hammer on hold for a while?

73
00:05:16,485 --> 00:05:17,685
Okay, okay.

74
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:18,785
I guess we have no choice

75
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:22,185
-but to search for those with a nail tattoo on his arm. -Sonoko, don't cry.

76
00:05:22,185 --> 00:05:23,885
But unlike in the past,

77
00:05:23,885 --> 00:05:28,285
tattoos have become a part of fashion nowadays, so many people have them.

78
00:05:28,285 --> 00:05:29,685
Hey, Sonoko.

79
00:05:29,685 --> 00:05:33,385
Does Roku Itagaki have anything to do with a nail?

80
00:05:33,385 --> 00:05:36,985
Yes, a drawing of a nail that looks sort of grotesque.

81
00:05:36,985 --> 00:05:38,085
What?

82
00:05:39,385 --> 00:05:41,685
Sonoko, can you say that again please?

83
00:05:41,685 --> 00:05:47,085
Like I told you, it's the logo for his old indies band, Nail Snake.

84
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:50,285
It is a snake with its head pierced through with a nail.

85
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:53,085
Do you know anybody that is wearing a tattoo of that logo?

86
00:05:53,085 --> 00:05:55,185
There are many.

87
00:05:55,185 --> 00:05:59,585
There seems to be a tattoo shop that is also a fan shop of the band.

88
00:05:59,585 --> 00:06:03,785
So if you're a fan and want a tattoo, that's the place to go.

89
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:07,985
I'm sure that shop was somewhere near Central Haido Bridge.

90
00:06:07,985 --> 00:06:09,685
Huh? Ran?

91
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:10,885
Ran?

92
00:06:10,885 --> 00:06:12,085
Hey.

93
00:06:13,185 --> 00:06:14,685
No!

94
00:06:14,685 --> 00:06:17,685
This isn't the drawing that I saw!

95
00:06:17,685 --> 00:06:20,185
Are you sure it's not this drawing?

96
00:06:20,185 --> 00:06:24,085
It's true that this drawing isn't a grotesque drawing of a nail.

97
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:25,985
That logo of the band,

98
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,885
has it been changed to a new one?

99
00:06:27,885 --> 00:06:29,385
Huh?

100
00:06:29,385 --> 00:06:30,485
Look!

101
00:06:30,485 --> 00:06:33,885
The thumb tack on the lower right that holds the flag in place isn't there.

102
00:06:33,885 --> 00:06:36,385
You were just about to put a new one on, right?

103
00:06:36,385 --> 00:06:38,885
Besides, there is a part of the wall that isn't discoloured

104
00:06:38,885 --> 00:06:40,885
because it was overshadowed by that flag.

105
00:06:40,885 --> 00:06:42,685
There are also places on other parts of the wall

106
00:06:42,685 --> 00:06:45,385
that aren't discoloured, too.

107
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:47,885
So I thought maybe there must've been something there

108
00:06:47,885 --> 00:06:50,785
that was recently removed.

109
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,685
I'm amazed you noticed, sonny.

110
00:06:52,685 --> 00:06:54,385
That's right.

111
00:06:54,385 --> 00:06:57,685
This is the new logo.

112
00:06:57,685 --> 00:06:59,485
It won't be official until next week.

113
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:01,585
It's this drawing!

114
00:07:01,585 --> 00:07:03,785
I saw this drawing on his arm!

115
00:07:03,785 --> 00:07:06,985
Have you given this tattoo to anyone yet?

116
00:07:06,985 --> 00:07:08,585
Huh? Yeah.

117
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:12,685
Some hardcore fans heard about the logo change.

118
00:07:12,685 --> 00:07:16,885
They insisted on having the new logo tattoo.

119
00:07:16,885 --> 00:07:18,085
Here it is.

120
00:07:18,085 --> 00:07:21,385
Look. It was these three.

121
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,585
From the right, Mr. Kiritani,

122
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:25,785
Mr. Yasui,

123
00:07:25,785 --> 00:07:27,885
and Mr. Kannai, I think.

124
00:07:27,885 --> 00:07:32,185
The customers who get tattooed send us their pictures later.

125
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:36,585
Takumi, do any of these men look familiar?

126
00:07:36,585 --> 00:07:40,385
It was dark and he was wearing a hat, so I can't tell.

127
00:07:40,385 --> 00:07:45,985
But I saw the nail as he was getting into his car, which was nearby.

128
00:07:45,985 --> 00:07:47,785
Car?

129
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:50,485
Does the person in the middle owns the foreign car

130
00:07:50,485 --> 00:07:51,985
that he's leaning against?

131
00:07:51,985 --> 00:07:55,985
Yes. I think he said that he's been riding it for 10 years.

132
00:07:55,985 --> 00:07:58,585
Hey, wasn't it this car?

133
00:07:58,585 --> 00:07:59,685
It's black, too.

134
00:08:00,785 --> 00:08:02,485
I can't tell.

135
00:08:02,485 --> 00:08:05,685
What about the cap that the person to the right is wearing?

136
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,285
It wasn't that kind of hat.

137
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:11,685
Hey, why did they decide to change the logo?

138
00:08:11,685 --> 00:08:17,285
Actually, this logo was designed by Roku, who debuted as a soloist.

139
00:08:17,285 --> 00:08:21,385
It seems that many fans requested the logo to change.

140
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:24,085
Because of what happened to Roku,

141
00:08:24,085 --> 00:08:27,785
Nail Snake is going to hold a memorial live performance tonight.

142
00:08:27,785 --> 00:08:31,385
Despite all kinds of things happening, Roku was the leader's best friend.

143
00:08:32,785 --> 00:08:36,185
The person behind this person is...

144
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,385
Yoko Okino.

145
00:08:42,385 --> 00:08:43,785
I mean the thing that she's holding

146
00:08:43,785 --> 00:08:45,385
is the pot I was talking about this afternoon

147
00:08:45,385 --> 00:08:48,785
that you can get from buying the drip type coffee.

148
00:08:49,885 --> 00:08:53,185
So Yoko was the one advertising it.

149
00:08:53,185 --> 00:08:57,385
You didn't even see the commercial so how did you find out about it?

150
00:08:57,385 --> 00:08:58,585
Well...

151
00:09:00,285 --> 00:09:01,985
It's because of this.

152
00:09:01,985 --> 00:09:04,185
The advertisement vehicle.

153
00:09:04,185 --> 00:09:07,185
It was so cute that I took a picture of it with my cell phone.

154
00:09:08,685 --> 00:09:09,685
Wait a second.

155
00:09:09,685 --> 00:09:13,585
If there's an advertisement vehicle for the pot, maybe...

156
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:16,385
No, there couldn't be.

157
00:09:16,385 --> 00:09:18,585
May I have a look at it, too?

158
00:09:18,585 --> 00:09:19,585
Sure.

159
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,085
But it really is a cute coffee pot.

160
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:33,585
I'm sorry. I think I mistakenly pushed the wrong button.

161
00:09:33,585 --> 00:09:34,885
No problem, really.

162
00:09:37,985 --> 00:09:41,985
And here we are at Big Haido Bridge, the last bridge.

163
00:09:41,985 --> 00:09:44,585
I guess you don't remember anything, right?

164
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:47,385
About which bridge you saw that suspicious man on.

165
00:09:50,785 --> 00:09:52,785
Let's go to the police.

166
00:10:05,685 --> 00:10:09,385
There are some things Takumi said that are incomprehensible,

167
00:10:09,385 --> 00:10:11,285
but it seems that he's telling the truth.

168
00:10:13,685 --> 00:10:16,785
But I'm sure the police will question him persistently

169
00:10:16,785 --> 00:10:18,985
about the shiny hammer and all.

170
00:10:46,185 --> 00:10:48,785
I see. So that's the story.

171
00:10:48,785 --> 00:10:50,085
I've figured out

172
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:53,785
who put Roku Itagaki in the bag and threw him in the river.

173
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:14,489
But I really saw it!

174
00:11:14,489 --> 00:11:17,889
A big shiny hammer.

175
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:19,289
You know what, kiddo?

176
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:22,089
I think he's talking about a dream that he had.

177
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:23,489
A dream?

178
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:24,889
It's not a dream!

179
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:27,389
The part about Mr. Itagaki being thrown in the river

180
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:29,289
was probably a coincidence.

181
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:32,289
But about him having seen Mr. Itagaki's face from inside the bag,

182
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:34,489
and the thing about the nail tattoo on the arm

183
00:11:34,489 --> 00:11:36,489
were all probably what he dreamt, too.

184
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:40,089
Back then, it was about this dark, right?

185
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:43,189
You can't see a person's face or a tattoo.

186
00:11:43,189 --> 00:11:45,289
I guess not.

187
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:47,189
Wait.

188
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:50,089
Maybe it's the fireworks?

189
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:53,089
He saw a lot of things because the place was lit up by the fireworks.

190
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:56,089
It seems that the fireworks were shot up at the start of the New Year.

191
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:58,889
Which means that the suspect was on the other side,

192
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:03,489
where you could see the fireworks.

193
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,989
If he was on the side where the fireworks went up,

194
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:07,389
it wouldn't be too easy to see that tattoo

195
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:10,489
because it would be overshadowed by backlight.

196
00:12:10,489 --> 00:12:11,789
I see.

197
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:14,689
But if he was on the other side of the bridge,

198
00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:16,889
he would be able to see the face that stuck out of the bag.

199
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:20,189
I don't think he'd be able to make out the tattoo drawing on the arm.

200
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:22,489
Even if the car Takumi was riding was in the middle lane,

201
00:12:22,489 --> 00:12:25,489
it'd still be hard to see the handrail.

202
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:28,589
So how could he see the man's arm?

203
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:33,489
I told you, I saw it because the car's driver side window was down.

204
00:12:33,489 --> 00:12:36,189
That means you saw the tattoo on the man's arm

205
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:40,889
when the man got in his car, right?

206
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:42,889
But he would've had to sit in the driver's seat.

207
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:45,289
If so, I don't think that you could've seen the tattoo.

208
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:47,089
But I saw it.

209
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:48,489
Maybe...

210
00:12:48,489 --> 00:12:52,389
the man had his arm out of the driver's window?

211
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:56,889
Wait! That means that his tattoo is on his right arm.

212
00:12:56,889 --> 00:12:58,189
If the car was in the other lane,

213
00:12:58,189 --> 00:13:00,189
the car would be facing right if looking from this side.

214
00:13:00,189 --> 00:13:01,989
His right arm can't be seen.

215
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,789
Okay, let's go to the tattoo shop that we went earlier

216
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:07,389
and have them show us the picture again.

217
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:08,689
I don't think we can.

218
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,989
Because they said they would be closing at 18:00 today

219
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:15,589
to go to a memorial live performance.

220
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:16,889
Hey...

221
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:18,389
Maybe...

222
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:22,289
there's a snapshot of them on your cell phone, Ran?

223
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:26,189
Right, Eisuke?

224
00:13:31,189 --> 00:13:33,089
I found it! It's here!

225
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,889
I don't remember taking a picture like this though.

226
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:38,589
Well,

227
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:41,289
when I mistakenly pushed the button,

228
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:42,689
I guess I took it coincidentally.

229
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:44,789
Well, I guess it was an unexpected success born of failure.

230
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:46,689
Thanks to this picture,

231
00:13:46,689 --> 00:13:50,589
the guy to the left with the tattoo on his left arm is ruled out,

232
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:52,489
so the culprit's been narrowed down to the guy on the right

233
00:13:52,489 --> 00:13:54,689
and the one in the middle.

234
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:57,089
The culprit was riding his car, right?

235
00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:00,389
So the person with his car in the picture is the most suspicious.

236
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:01,389
Idiot.

237
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:04,189
The guy to the right may be riding it, too.

238
00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:08,589
But the sales clerk said he's been driving foreign cars for 10 years.

239
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:11,689
That's more the reason why the guy in the middle could be a car lover,

240
00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:14,389
driving around in a foreign car and...

241
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:15,989
A foreign car?

242
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:17,889
The steering wheel of a foreign car is on the left.

243
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:20,789
That means if he had a foreign car, the wheel would be on the left.

244
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:23,289
The inside is dark so it cannot be seen from this side.

245
00:14:24,789 --> 00:14:27,389
Ran, give that to me.

246
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:31,189
But he could've rented a Japanese car on that day.

247
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:32,189
No.

248
00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:36,189
If he rented a car, he would've rented a foreign car.

249
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:38,389
Because everything would go to waste if he gets into an accident

250
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:41,089
while driving a car with the steering wheel that he's not used to

251
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,589
when transporting the corpse.

252
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:44,989
So the culprit is?

253
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:49,589
Yeah. The guy to the right, the one wearing the cap.

254
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,489
If I remember correctly, his name is Kiritani.

255
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:54,189
Let's report it to the police right away and have him arrested.

256
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:56,089
No. It's still impossible to get him arrested.

257
00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:59,189
Everything we've come up with till now is just circumstantial evidence.

258
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,689
We don't have any conclusive evidence yet.

259
00:15:02,689 --> 00:15:05,089
But with all that we have,

260
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:07,689
the police could take him to the station and interrogate him.

261
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:09,889
Possibly making him confess.

262
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:12,589
After all, there's Takumi's testimony, too.

263
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:14,389
However,

264
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:16,789
he shouldn't say anything about the shiny hammer.

265
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:19,389
Yes, I understand.

266
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:20,389
But I...

267
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:22,589
I really saw it!

268
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:23,789
Takumi.

269
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,489
Hey.

270
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:27,989
Maybe he's talking about this building?

271
00:15:27,989 --> 00:15:30,489
Look. The lights on both sides of the elevator connects

272
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:33,689
and it looks like the handle of a hammer.

273
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:36,989
Hey, like I've been saying, unless there's the tip of the hammer,

274
00:15:36,989 --> 00:15:38,589
it doesn't look like one.

275
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:41,589
What did the tip of a hammer look like?

276
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:44,989
I guess there are all kinds.

277
00:15:44,989 --> 00:15:46,389
Cylindrical ones,

278
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:50,389
ones with nail removers on one side that look like an upside down boat.

279
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:51,689
Talking of upside down,

280
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:53,989
there may be ones that are inflated in the middle

281
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:56,189
that kind of looks like a pot turned upside down.

282
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,389
-Pot! -Pot!

283
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:00,689
Come to think of it...

284
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:04,489
Just as I thought. Look!

285
00:16:04,489 --> 00:16:06,789
There are decorative lights around the pot.

286
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:09,589
Which means that the hammer was upside down, right?

287
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:14,489
What Takumi saw was the decorative lights on the advertisement vehicle

288
00:16:14,489 --> 00:16:17,089
and elevator light overlapping each other,

289
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:19,689
resulting in what resembled a large hammer.

290
00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:21,289
So you weren't dreaming after all.

291
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:22,589
I'm sorry, Takumi.

292
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:23,589
It's okay.

293
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:26,789
Why didn't he say it was upside down in the first place?

294
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:30,589
But the fireworks went up on this side, right?

295
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:33,789
If the culprit was on the side opposite the fireworks,

296
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:36,989
I don't think Takumi could've seen the building in question.

297
00:16:36,989 --> 00:16:40,389
It's true that it doesn't look that way from this bridge,

298
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:45,189
but he can see it from Central Haido Bridge that is between that building.

299
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:47,789
Which means that the culprit threw the bag with the dead body inside

300
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:49,489
from Central Haido Bridge.

301
00:16:49,489 --> 00:16:50,889
Yeah, most probably.

302
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:53,689
We'll probably be able to find some evidence over there.

303
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:55,389
Over there?

304
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,689
The elevator of that building is round and protruded.

305
00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:00,289
In order for the light on the other side to come into view

306
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:01,989
and become two beams of light,

307
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:05,289
you've got to move along a bit.

308
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:06,789
But then if you move too much,

309
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:10,389
the pot will look too backwards that it won't look like a hammer.

310
00:17:10,389 --> 00:17:14,289
So you have to be at a specific place to see a perfect glowing hammer.

311
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:15,689
So if we match all this,

312
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:18,689
the place where the culprit dropped the bag with the corpse inside

313
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:20,789
can more or less be specified.

314
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,789
But what kind of evidence could there be?

315
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:23,989
Probably...

316
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:26,889
If the culprit threw the lighter away,

317
00:17:26,889 --> 00:17:30,489
the fingerprints of the culprit may at least be found on the lighter.

318
00:17:30,489 --> 00:17:33,589
He may have been wearing gloves when he dropped the bag,

319
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:36,289
but if he drove off soon after he threw the lighter away,

320
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,389
I'm sure he took them off.

321
00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:40,189
Since the tattoo was near his wrist,

322
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:44,589
Takumi couldn't see the nail tattoo if the culprit was wearing gloves.

323
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:47,989
Maybe he's at Roku's memorial live?

324
00:17:47,989 --> 00:17:51,889
It could be, but we've got to find the evidence before we...

325
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:53,189
You know,

326
00:17:53,189 --> 00:17:57,389
I've thought up an interesting way to make the culprit confess right away.

327
00:17:59,689 --> 00:18:02,689
So the final song for today

328
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:06,689
is the song that my best friend, Roku, loved the most.

329
00:18:23,689 --> 00:18:25,289
Just what do you think you're doing?

330
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:27,089
This is a parking lot, you know!

331
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:29,689
It'll be a disaster if the flames touch the cars.

332
00:18:29,689 --> 00:18:31,389
Oh, just some kid.

333
00:18:31,389 --> 00:18:33,589
Excuse me. I'm with the police.

334
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:36,689
I'm very sorry,

335
00:18:36,689 --> 00:18:39,489
but I'd like to ask you to come with us for questioning.

336
00:18:39,489 --> 00:18:40,789
Why?

337
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:43,889
We've got a witness saying that somebody who resembled you

338
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:48,189
threw a bag with a dead body inside from Central Haido Bridge.

339
00:18:48,189 --> 00:18:50,889
He's watching you from the car on the other side

340
00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:53,089
and he said that he's certain you're the one.

341
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:54,689
You mean he's saying he saw my face?

342
00:18:54,689 --> 00:18:57,489
No, he didn't see your face.

343
00:18:57,489 --> 00:19:01,189
He saw that tattoo of yours.

344
00:19:01,189 --> 00:19:02,289
What?

345
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:05,589
And he also says he heard your voice.

346
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:08,289
Huh? The guy must be lying.

347
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:10,389
He couldn't have heard my voice

348
00:19:10,389 --> 00:19:11,889
because there were fireworks at that time.

349
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:18,489
He couldn't have heard you because of the fireworks?

350
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:20,289
Officer Takagi, you heard him just now, didn't you?

351
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:22,489
Yes, sir! I definitely heard him!

352
00:19:22,489 --> 00:19:24,189
The fact that there were fireworks shot up

353
00:19:24,189 --> 00:19:26,989
is something that only the culprit and witness know.

354
00:19:26,989 --> 00:19:29,889
We'd like you to explain at the station

355
00:19:29,889 --> 00:19:32,689
why you made such a remark just now.

356
00:19:32,689 --> 00:19:35,489
Don't tell me that you guys set up the fireworks just now, too?

357
00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:37,189
Yeah, that's right.

358
00:19:37,189 --> 00:19:39,589
We recreated the circumstances of what happened that day

359
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:42,789
and pretended to show you to the witness,

360
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:46,789
but we just wanted you to recall the events of that day,

361
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:50,989
to make you say the word "fireworks" from your side.

362
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:53,589
Well, setting up something as simple as this,

363
00:19:53,589 --> 00:19:55,889
can only be thought up by a brat, though.

364
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:02,089
After that, Mr. Kiritani was taken to the station

365
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:03,789
and confessed without resisting.

366
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:07,489
His motive was a grudge he held against Mr. Itagaki

367
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:10,289
for betraying the band and debuting alone.

368
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:13,589
He firstly intended to dispose the corpse in a mountain some distance away,

369
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:15,289
but he noticed that the police

370
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:18,789
were checking for drunk driving on Central Haido Bridge

371
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:21,689
and decided instantly to throw the corpse over the bridge.

372
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,989
By the way, the thing he threw down from the bridge

373
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:27,289
was Roku's lighter after all.

374
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:30,889
In order to hide the blood that splattered on him while hitting Roku,

375
00:20:30,889 --> 00:20:34,289
he seems to have worn Roku's jacket that was in the room.

376
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:35,289
When he disposed the corpse,

377
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:38,589
he absentmindedly used Roku's lighter that was in the jacket.

378
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:43,989
The lighter was also found in Teimusu River.

379
00:20:43,989 --> 00:20:49,289
With Takumi's testimony, Mr. Kiritani is sure to be arrested, too.

380
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:54,089
With this in mind, we finished interrogation and head for home.

381
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:56,989
Today was really exciting!

382
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:00,889
After all, I was able to work and solve the case

383
00:21:00,889 --> 00:21:03,089
where a famous person was killed.

384
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:04,489
No, no.

385
00:21:04,489 --> 00:21:06,489
I bet you've disclosed various kinds of cases

386
00:21:06,489 --> 00:21:08,889
involving famous people.

387
00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:11,789
Or at least cases about them, right?

388
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:13,489
Of course.

389
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:16,489
Yoko Okino asked me to work for her several times.

390
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:18,789
What? You mean that top idol?

391
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:20,389
You're indeed a renown detective, aren't you?

392
00:21:20,389 --> 00:21:21,689
I guess so.

393
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:25,689
Then I bet there have been cases with famous people that didn't go public.

394
00:21:27,189 --> 00:21:30,489
You know, when a famous person comes to you in secret.

395
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:35,389
And you solve the case

396
00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:37,289
even before it makes the news.

397
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:39,489
I wonder if I have ever handled a case like that?

398
00:21:39,489 --> 00:21:41,489
What? Come on.

399
00:21:42,389 --> 00:21:45,989
Please tell me without being bashful, Detective Mouri.

400
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:53,489
If it's okay with you, we can talk about it over dinner from now.

401
00:21:54,489 --> 00:21:57,189
I'm feeling pretty sleepy.

402
00:21:58,489 --> 00:22:01,489
I'm sorry, Eisuke. Can we make it some other day?

403
00:22:01,489 --> 00:22:03,389
It seems that Conan's tired.

404
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:04,989
Okay.

405
00:22:06,189 --> 00:22:07,989
No doubt about it.

406
00:22:07,989 --> 00:22:11,689
There was someone recently, too.

407
00:22:11,689 --> 00:22:13,089
Let's see...

408
00:22:13,089 --> 00:22:15,889
You know, they were on TV a lot,

409
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:19,289
but is taking a rest and now they don't appear anymore.

410
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:21,489
This guy is trying to get information...

411
00:22:22,989 --> 00:22:24,589
on Rena Mizunashi.

412
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:30,489
I can't be showing you our cards that easily.

413
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:35,189
So long as you keep your cards covered.

414
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:49,089
Next Conan's Hint:

415
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:51,289
"The Red-headed League"

416
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,689
I love Holmes!

417
00:24:52,689 --> 00:24:55,089
You're just like a certain Holmes freak that I know.

418
00:24:55,089 --> 00:24:56,189
That's true.
