1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,040
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,940
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,740
The princess and the queen, the two moms.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,640
The key is in Pop's hands.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,240
His name is Detective Conan.

8
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,760
Pops is asked to find the person

9
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,860
who is after the life of Mr. Mikio Fujieda

10
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,460
for a fee of 10 million yen.

11
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,260
He thinks this is an easy case

12
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,660
and holds a celebration party in advance, only to spend a lot of money.

13
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,560
He couldn't close the case, however,

14
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,360
and he is in debt of about 8 million yen.

15
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,460
He is shocked and takes to his bed.

16
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,660
Acting on behalf of pops,

17
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,460
Ran's mom goes to the client's place.

18
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,360
There, she happens to meet my mom.

19
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,360
And then, Mr. Mikio Fujieda is killed in a closed room.

20
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,360
"Two Princesses of a Kind (Part 2)"

21
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,160
Well, well. It's Eri.

22
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,160
And Yukiko, too.

23
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,560
What's the matter with you two?

24
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,660
I'm here for...

25
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,360
I'm here on behalf of my husband.

26
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,060
He got a request for finding a person living on the premises

27
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,360
that is after the life of Mr. Mikio Fujieda.

28
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,660
But how did he know

29
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,960
that the person is among the people on the premises?

30
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,560
These were placed under the pillow of Mr. Mikio Fujieda.

31
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,960
"Watch behind you! I'll send you to heaven."

32
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,560
So was this used bullet.

33
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,660
Who could have done a thing like that

34
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,260
except someone living in the house?

35
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,060
You could be right.

36
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,560
-The crime took place at about... -Hey.

37
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,660
-Wasn't it about 8 pm? -Yes.

38
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,660
It's when all of us were watching

39
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,960
the display of the surveillance camera.

40
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,260
I see.

41
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,860
Then suddenly, Mr. Fujieda stood up holding his hands up,

42
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,460
was shot and fell down to the floor.

43
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,460
We hurried to the room

44
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,060
and heard two gun shots from inside the room.

45
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,160
We broke the door, went inside the room,

46
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,560
and found this.

47
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,060
Inspector Megure!

48
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,360
We found the gun, sir.

49
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,760
Good!

50
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,960
The gun is a Colt Compact 45 automatic.

51
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,960
There were three cartridges beside the gun

52
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,560
and the number of cartridges coincides with the number of bullet wounds.

53
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,460
It seems that the culprit shot across this window

54
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,660
and hurried out of this place.

55
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,860
Then we have to consider the possibility of a culprit from outside.

56
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,160
But what is this?

57
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,260
This towel with a burn on it.

58
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,460
It is probably...

59
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,160
It was probably burnt when the culprit

60
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,860
wrapped the towel around the gun when firing,

61
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,360
and tried to hide the powder traces.

62
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,060
Or tried to muffle the gun shot but failed.

63
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,360
-Hey, ladies. -Officer Chiba, you go and find out

64
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,060
where and how the gun was obtained.

65
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,060
Yes.

66
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,160
Officer Takagi, you go and find out

67
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,860
if any suspicious person was around or seen.

68
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,960
Yes.

69
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,260
Hey, wait a minute.

70
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,960
And by the way...

71
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,860
Check the bullets in the body

72
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,360
against the bullet left under the pillow, please.

73
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,860
Now, Inspector, bring the lab people

74
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,260
and come with me to the living room.

75
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,960
We'll check the gun powder traces on all the people in the house,

76
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,160
and start questioning them.

77
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,160
Hey, Eri.

78
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,360
Come on, Inspector. Eri is trying her best.

79
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,560
-But... -For her, 10 million yen is at stake.

80
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,860
What?

81
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,260
Hey!

82
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,360
I wanna go to the toilet.

83
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,360
I need to...

84
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,960
Toilet!

85
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,360
Then, one by one, let's have each of you talk to the Inspector.

86
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,760
After Mikio was shot in the audio room,

87
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,260
for about 3 minutes until we found the dead body,

88
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,860
where were you all, and what were you all doing.

89
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,360
I went to my room to get the key

90
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,760
and ran to the audio room.

91
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,660
I called the police and an ambulance on the phone in my room

92
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,660
and I stayed in my room.

93
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,960
But you knew your husband was shot?

94
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,760
Still, there could be a man with a gun around!

95
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,160
Could be.

96
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,960
Besides, you know I was watching Mikio get shot and go down

97
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,260
on the display with the butler and the others?

98
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,260
If you must suspect someone, you can pick on Shigeru

99
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,460
because he went out of the monitoring room just before Mikio went down.

100
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,360
Did you leave?

101
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
I did.

102
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,160
I had to write the manuscript I was working on in my room.

103
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,960
But I stopped writing

104
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,760
and joined Eri and the others to go up to the audio room.

105
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,660
I heard the two gun shots in front of the room.

106
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,060
So I couldn't have possibly done it.

107
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,960
Did you hear any suspicious sound or something?

108
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,860
No. The sound of the classical music was so loud.

109
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,460
Excuse me, Inspector,

110
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,260
but do you mind if I sit down?

111
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,260
Of course not.

112
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,960
You can sit down, Mr. Ueki and everybody else.

113
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,760
I'd prefer to keep standing. It's easier on me.

114
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,860
Inspector Megure!

115
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,960
I caught a man loitering around the garden, sir.

116
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,960
-You did? -Hey! Come on up quick.

117
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,060
Oh, he is...

118
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,160
He is Mr. Doi, the gardener.

119
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,860
Gardener, is he?

120
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,460
He's been like this, sir.

121
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,760
He doesn't say anything, doesn't answer me.

122
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,860
Mr. Doi was at a place in the garden not very far from the audio room,

123
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,060
for at least 3 minutes after Mr. Fujieda was shot at 8 o'clock.

124
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,260
Mr. Doi was seen in the surveillance camera and on the display.

125
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,460
He was absorbed in gardening even after the incident

126
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,760
and just didn't come here.

127
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,660
Seeing is believing, they say.

128
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,160
Would you care to go

129
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,360
and take a look at the video of the surveillance camera?

130
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,660
I see.

131
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,360
He seems to be in the garden when he was shot.

132
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,660
But he disappeared right after it.

133
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,760
But the light is seen on the screen.

134
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,360
The light is flickering, and that means he is there.

135
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,260
But if there were cameras in all of the rooms,

136
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,060
we would be able to tell when, where, and who did what.

137
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,460
I wish we knew.

138
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,160
But these pictures tell you enough, don't they?

139
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,260
The chance of an outsider is breaking in is slight,

140
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,660
and the possibility that the crime was committed by an insider

141
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,160
is more likely.

142
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
How come?

143
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,760
There are so many cameras around,

144
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,960
but there is no picture of a suspicious person on any of them.

145
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,360
The crime was committed by a person

146
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,760
who knows precisely where the cameras are located, see?

147
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,860
I see.

148
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,860
So, we have four suspects to go.

149
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,860
When they commit the crime,

150
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,660
it seems that two of them are always together.

151
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,460
How about going after their motives?

152
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,760
Conan, you are very quiet today.

153
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,860
You usually get all excited over a case. What's come over you?

154
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,560
The two of them say so much

155
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,760
that there's not much left for me to say.

156
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,860
But this is a strange case.

157
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,360
The butler and Motoka were with us watching the display

158
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,260
when the first shot was fired.

159
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,160
But they have no alibi for the second and third shots.

160
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,060
Mr. Doi was not seen after the first shot except for the light.

161
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,760
Shigeru Fujieda has no alibi for the first shot,

162
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,460
but he was with us at the second shot.

163
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,560
This means, if the displayed image of the surveillance camera is a trick,

164
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,660
or if the second and third shots were part of a trick,

165
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,360
their alibis won't stand.

166
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,860
Two things worry me.

167
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,560
One is that the second shot

168
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,060
and the third shot were about 3 minutes apart,

169
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,260
and the other is that he inserted a bookmark into the book he was reading.

170
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,460
If he was being threatened with a gun pointed at him,

171
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,060
why did he do such a thing?

172
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,160
Who resented him?

173
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,160
Of the four people?

174
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,860
Yes.

175
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,460
Mr. Ueki, the butler, for sure.

176
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,960
He was ordered to clean the storage that was full of dust,

177
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,360
and he had a relapse of asthma.

178
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,660
But if I were Shigeru, I would've got angry.

179
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,860
I know the Master inherited this residence

180
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,360
but Shigeru has been living in this house since his childhood,

181
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,660
yet now he has to pay rent because he was told to pay.

182
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,260
The young mistress had no grudge on Master, I suppose,

183
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,560
but it's so obvious that she married for the inheritance.

184
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,160
I wouldn't be surprised if she is overjoyed about the master's death.

185
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,360
You could be right.

186
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,960
Mr. Doi, the gardener glared at the young Mistress the other day.

187
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,160
Of course, he would.

188
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,960
When she learned the master was going to rebuild this house,

189
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,760
she asked him to break down the garden

190
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,060
and turn it into a swimming pool.

191
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,560
What are you doing up there?

192
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,360
Excuse me, but the late Mistress cared much for the garden.

193
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,560
It has been most dear to her.

194
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,560
But...

195
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,660
That's enough. Leave right this minute.

196
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,860
Yes, sir.

197
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,260
Excuse me, but are you from Kouchi, Mr. Doi?

198
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,260
What?

199
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,860
I've been in Takajou town.

200
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,760
In Takajou town! What a coincidence.

201
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,460
I'm from Kami town.

202
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,460
Wow, from Kami!

203
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,160
When I was a small fry, I used to swim in the Kagami River.

204
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,460
You did, ma gal!

205
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,860
That river was the prettiest,

206
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,460
and that famous Ryoma Sakamoto

207
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,760
learned swimming in dat river, did ya know?

208
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,160
Is that Kouchi accent?

209
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,160
I wonder if Yukiko was born in Kouchi?

210
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,260
No. When she was an actress,

211
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,360
she played a role in Kouchi accent.

212
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,660
She learned the accent then.

213
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,160
She is a genius in playing and applying things like this.

214
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,260
That's what Shinichi used to tell me.

215
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,660
Is that so?

216
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,160
Good news?

217
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,060
Yes. He told me a very interesting thing.

218
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,660
He heard the gunshot several seconds

219
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,960
after he heard the glass crack.

220
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,860
What?

221
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,060
What does that mean?

222
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,260
Usually, the glass will crack at the same time as the gunshot?

223
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,260
I don't know.

224
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,060
The glass was cracked with a gun then the shot was fired?

225
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,160
But it bothers me, the sound of the cracked glass.

226
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,660
Naturally, it was before the first gunshot was heard, wasn't it?

227
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,960
He doesn't remember how many shots he heard.

228
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,660
He thought some naughty kids in the neighborhood

229
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,460
were making noise out of bamboo fireworks or something,

230
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,660
so he didn't care much about it.

231
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,560
I wonder it may have something to do with the hint Yusaku gave me.

232
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,660
Did you call your husband?

233
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,360
Yes, I did just a moment ago.

234
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,160
When I told him about the case,

235
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,760
he chuckled and told me.

236
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,160
He says, "Wrong road sign. Tell her that."

237
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,260
Tell her? Tell who?

238
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,760
Huh?

239
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,760
Of course, to you.

240
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,660
Oh, to me.

241
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,460
Should I be overjoyed?

242
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,960
Of course not.

243
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,160
I thought so.

244
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,240
Excuse me, Inspector,

245
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,840
but didn't you investigate enough already?

246
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,240
And besides, now you know it's impossible for us

247
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,740
to have committed the crime.

248
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,840
Inspector.

249
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,340
The neighbors say they have not seen any suspicious person.

250
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,540
I see.

251
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,240
And we don't know how the gun was obtained,

252
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,340
but the bullets used in the murder

253
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:13,840
were identical to the bullet that was used for making threats.

254
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,740
But there is one strange thing.

255
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,040
One of the bullets extracted out of the body

256
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,340
shows a streak on the surface of the bullet.

257
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,140
What does that mean?

258
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,540
Now I see.

259
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,940
-What? -Don't what me!

260
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,340
You look as if you alone know it all already.

261
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,540
Who cares because I do know it all.

262
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,440
Well, then, tell me all about it, Shinichi, dear.

263
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,740
Don't you call yourself the Night Baroness

264
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,540
and start a flashy action scene again, mom.

265
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,840
Don't worry. It's all right.

266
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,340
Tonight, I'll be cool and collected with no-frills action.

267
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,340
People!

268
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,040
It's past eleven o'clock already!

269
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,840
Will you do the rest of it tomorrow?

270
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,140
We are still investigating.

271
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,740
Investigating?

272
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,540
You have done all the investigating already and finished it!

273
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,040
I don't like to be deceived!

274
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,740
Yes, we have been deceived by the culprit.

275
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,440
It was made to look as if Mr. Mikio Fujieda was threatened

276
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,240
with a gun from outside the window and shot.

277
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,640
But the culprit couldn't deceive the eyes of the detective.

278
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,040
Can't deceive the private eyes of this Baroness of Night!

279
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,540
Hey. Where did she get those lights?

280
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,740
Are you saying that...

281
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,540
You found out who the culprit is?

282
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,540
I surely did.

283
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,940
But how did the culprit deceive you?

284
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,340
The surveillance camera?

285
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,040
We have been deceived a lot earlier than that.

286
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,740
The culprit has already deceived us into thinking wrong

287
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:54,240
by showing us the two memo sheets and the used bullet.

288
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,440
The culprit put up a deceiving road sign

289
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,840
to make us think he was going to shoot a gun.

290
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,940
But Mr. Mikio was actually shot with a gun.

291
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,340
Did you notice, Inspector Megure?

292
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,140
Mikio was reading a book just before he was shot,

293
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,640
and he placed a bookmark into the book.

294
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,840
Yes, I remember.

295
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,740
Usually, you put a bookmark between the pages

296
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,940
when you finish reading the page,

297
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:23,840
not when you are threatened with a gun pointed at you.

298
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,340
You are right.

299
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,240
What would you do, Inspector,

300
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,040
if you finished reading a book and wanted to take a rest?

301
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,540
I'd turn my head or rub my shoulders.

302
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,840
Or stretch out and...

303
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,840
That's right. He just stood up and stretched.

304
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,840
Don't be a fool.

305
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,140
Right after that, Mikio fell to the floor, didn't he?

306
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,140
You don't go down right after stretching.

307
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,440
It's not the stretching that did it. Standing up did it.

308
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,840
It's rare, but some people stand up quickly

309
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,140
and feel faint or fall down.

310
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,740
But how could he have fainted at such convenient timing?

311
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,140
There is a drug that does it.

312
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:06,740
The name of the chemical is isop... isopro... isope?

313
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,740
Isoprotelenol, it is.

314
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,540
It is used for inducing faintness.

315
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,440
It is given to patients who have a tendency to faint easily,

316
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,240
and it's used for inducing feeling faint.

317
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,540
They are trying to find out what causes fainting.

318
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,440
I see. That drug made him faint

319
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,440
and made us believe that he held at gun point then shot.

320
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,040
Is that right?

321
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,740
Yes. What I wanted to say is that

322
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,140
he was not yet shot at that time.

323
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,740
But the culprit thought that it was not sufficient to fool us,

324
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:39,140
so added a word to make sure to mislead us.

325
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,540
He said, "The master is holding his hands up."

326
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,240
What? Don't tell me...

327
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,740
He had us taken in good.

328
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,840
Yeah.

329
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,340
You did really well, didn't you?

330
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,740
Mr. Souhachi Ueki, the butler.

331
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,440
Mr. Ueki knew well

332
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,040
that Mr. Fujieda drinks coffee while he reads a book.

333
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,040
And he stands up and stretches after reading.

334
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,140
This chemical is good for asthma

335
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,240
when you take a moderate amount of it.

336
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,640
Well, he made an alibi for himself

337
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,340
and then pretended to go and get the key to the audio room,

338
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,540
but he actually went to the room from outside,

339
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:17,440
and shot three bullets into Mr. Fujieda who was passed out,

340
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,340
to murder him.

341
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,340
But you heard two shots, didn't you?

342
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,640
Yukiko asked Mr. Doi and learned so a while ago.

343
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,140
Several seconds after the sound of the glass cracking,

344
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,140
he heard the shots.

345
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:36,340
And there was the loud sound of classical music played.

346
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,740
You understand, don't you?

347
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,240
I see.

348
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,140
It's a silencer!

349
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,940
He put a silencer on when he fired the first shot

350
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,140
so only the sound of glass cracking was heard.

351
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:53,040
And the silencer left a streak on the surface of the bullet.

352
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,540
Then he used a towel to hide the traces of gun powder.

353
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,940
Anyway, go find the silencer.

354
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,740
You don't need to.

355
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,440
Because the butler must still have it.

356
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,040
Probably in one of his socks.

357
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,040
What?

358
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,140
Excuse me.

359
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,440
Inspector! I've found it, the silencer!

360
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,540
He hesitated to sit down, so it dawned on me.

361
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,540
Sitting down will make the hem of his pants go up

362
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:24,240
and it may show what he had concealed.

363
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,440
Hey. You have burn marks!

364
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,740
I can withstand the burn, sir.

365
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,240
It's nothing, if I can keep the garden for the late Mistress.

366
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,840
-The garden, you say? -Yes, sir.

367
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,740
The garden of the premises has been carefully maintained

368
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:42,440
since the madam was a little child.

369
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,440
I feel she is somewhere here with me.

370
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,940
I cannot forgive the master, who is a perfect stranger to the house,

371
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,640
to have everything done his own way.

372
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,140
Gosh!

373
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,640
So, it's you. You're the culprit.

374
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,440
All this time, I thought it was his brother, Shigeru.

375
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,040
Now, my share of inheritance has decreased.

376
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,740
I hired a detective to get something on him,

377
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,140
but I made a big mistake!

378
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,240
Listen.

379
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,540
If Mr. Mikio Fujieda had no parents, brothers or sisters,

380
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,240
you would've gotten the entire share of inheritance.

381
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,040
No share goes to the brothers of a former wife.

382
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,240
Really?

383
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,540
Why, I got it all wrong!

384
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,140
But this is only if Mr. Fujieda left no will behind.

385
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,540
Anyway, I must ask for the amount of 10 million yen

386
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,640
for finding the culprit.

387
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,040
What? How can you?

388
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,440
Mikio got killed already!

389
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,740
The contract says

390
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,040
nothing about protecting Mr. Fujieda's life, as you can see.

391
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,640
See? Your signature and seal are here.

392
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,740
Okay.

393
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,140
With Mikio's inheritance, 10 million yen is small money.

394
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,940
I might add that until the inheritance is settled and finalized,

395
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,840
all the assets in the name of Mr. Fujieda's will be frozen,

396
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,240
so please pay me out of your private account.

397
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,340
I don't believe it!

398
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,940
You'd better. If you refuse to pay,

399
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,640
I will execute it by law to attach your property.

400
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,340
You understand, I hope?

401
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,140
Well, so it goes.

402
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,740
Afterwards, Mikio Fujieda's will was publicized as follows.

403
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,040
It said, "No inheritance will go to

404
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,740
those who were not able to protect my life.

405
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,640
The entire estate shall be donated to the country."

406
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,340
This has been carried out to the letter.

407
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,940
"Mouri Detective Agency" -The next day.

408
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,240
Here you are, dear.

409
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,840
After deducting your debt,

410
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,940
it comes down to one million and 943 thousand yen.

411
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,840
Now, you can thank me.

412
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,240
Don't you smell something?

413
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,240
Do you keep a pet or something?

414
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,240
A client of mine came this morning with a dog, and it did it.

415
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,240
By the way, it's been a long time, Yukiko.

416
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,740
Yeah. There's something that I want to ask you, Kogoro.

417
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,540
Hey, Eri. Come on and ask him.

418
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:27,040
No. You're the one who wanted to ask.

419
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,940
They want to know which one you chose

420
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,640
for the Miss Teitan High School Contest.

421
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,040
You mean the one that took place 20 years ago.

422
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,740
It's probably Eri

423
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,840
because they were in love with each other.

424
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,440
Surely it's Yukiko.

425
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,640
She was unbelievably beautiful, then.

426
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,440
It must be Eri, if I remember right.

427
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,940
Dear.

428
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,040
I was very ignorant of those festivities at that time

429
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,840
so I took the word "Miss" Teitan to mean mistake

430
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,240
and wrote the name of the one who I thought was a klutz.

431
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,340
What?

432
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,040
Then, if you knew what it really meant,

433
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,040
which one would you have chosen?

434
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,440
Of course, it's Yukiko.

435
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,140
You don't have to ask me. She was utterly beautiful.

436
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,140
No! Eri was pretty, too, for a smart girl!

437
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,840
I'd like to tell you.

438
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,940
For the work Yukiko and I did for you this time,

439
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,440
we'll take 10 percent of the total, which is 1 million yen.

440
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,040
And for us, I have to get paid for the bills at the bars,

441
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,140
and be reimbursed for dad's advance allowance,

442
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,940
and the living expenses for this month and next month.

443
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,140
And laundering dad's pants.

444
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,740
Here is your change.

445
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,740
Hey.

446
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,340
It's only 4,382 yen in all.

447
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,640
Well, let's go out and have something delicious, Yuki.

448
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,140
Let's go, Eri.

449
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,640
Hey!

450
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,940
And which one won the contest?

451
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,440
It's marginal.

452
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,820
Together with Hanga.

453
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,820
Yeah, yeah.

454
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,280
A messy room!

455
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,220
This is bad, Conan! Summer vacation is almost over!

456
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,880
Second semester has already started.
