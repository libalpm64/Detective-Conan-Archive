1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:03,570
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,270
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,070
Travel mysteries are so popular,

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,970
mystery churns in the ocean.

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,670
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,570
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,970
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,730
You two should thank me.

9
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,530
I've got a golden arm.

10
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,530
Alright already.

11
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,330
You're so persistent, dad.

12
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,730
You know, Pops...

13
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,330
You really are kind of talented.

14
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,230
In lotteries, at least.

15
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,130
I can't believe you won the first prize again

16
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,930
which was this trip.

17
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,730
What do you mean "kind of talented"?

18
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,230
I'm a genius.

19
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,530
What? You want to kill yourself?

20
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,930
"Seiji Hario (30)" -Go ahead then, go on, I dare you.

21
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,330
I've always done things this way, that's my style.

22
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,330
I get rid of anything I don't like.

23
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,430
Next stop, Shin-Shimonoseki.

24
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,830
Shin-Shimonoseki.

25
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,030
You may exit through the left.

26
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:55,030
"Friendship and Murder at the Kanmon Strait (Part 1)"

27
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,130
"The Strait Dream Tower"

28
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,230
"The Strait Dream Tower" -Conan, look.

29
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,230
You can see...

30
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,630
"Observatory on the 30th floor" -the entire city of Shimonoseki.

31
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,230
Wow, this is great.

32
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,630
Look over there,

33
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,430
"Ganryu Island" -that's Ganryu Island,

34
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,430
that's where Musashi Miyamoto and Kojiro Sasaki fought that famous battle.

35
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,130
It's smaller than I expected.

36
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:16,530
Hey, Ran. Isn't that Kyushu over there?

37
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,830
Yes, it is.

38
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,030
The Kanmon Strait is pretty narrow, isn't it?

39
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:26,030
Says here the narrowest area's only 700 m.

40
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,630
If you ran across it, you'd reach Kyushu in five minutes.

41
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,830
Oh for goodness sakes, how are you going to run across the ocean?

42
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,430
Really?

43
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,930
Dad, you're so embarrassing.

44
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,130
He's right, you can run across.

45
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:48,030
Are you talking about that bridge?

46
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,730
No, that's the Kanmon Bridge, it's only for cars.

47
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,230
But there's an underwater tunnel

48
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,330
"Keisuke Otsubo, Toru Akitaya" -directly under it for human traffic.

49
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,230
It's nicknamed "The People's Tunnel".

50
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,130
Gee, you sure know a lot.

51
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,230
We grew up in this neighborhood.

52
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,530
No wonder.

53
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,130
It can't be.

54
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,930
"Eiko Nojima, Akane Isaka" -Aren't you Kogoro Mouri?

55
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,530
Yes, I am.

56
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,130
I knew it.

57
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,330
He's that famous private detective.

58
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,930
My name's Akitaya.

59
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,230
I'm Keisuke Otsubo.

60
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,830
I'm Akane Isaka.

61
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,430
I'm Eiko Nojima.

62
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,030
We're all fans of yours, Mr. Mouri.

63
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,230
Aren't we? Aren't we?

64
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,330
-We sure are. -Yes.

65
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,430
Really?

66
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,830
Yeah, everyone knows Kogoro only for his name and his face,

67
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,530
which means...

68
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,830
If it's not an imposition,

69
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,430
would you join us for dinner?

70
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,030
Great idea. We'd really like to hear your stories.

71
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,630
I knew it.

72
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,430
Well...

73
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,330
They were nice enough to offer,

74
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,030
shall we accept?

75
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,730
Besides, they're locals so they probably know

76
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,030
where the good restaurants are.

77
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,530
We were raised here

78
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,930
but she and I have been living in Tokyo since college.

79
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,530
How do you all know each other?

80
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,930
We were all in the same class in high school.

81
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,430
High school classmates?

82
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,230
That's so nice.

83
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,030
12 years have passed since you graduated

84
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,830
but you're all still so close.

85
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,530
"Strait Dream Square" -I guess it's because

86
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,130
we all have such different personalities.

87
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,430
I am confident of my ability

88
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,630
but not very smart.

89
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,330
Otsubo's smart but he's a coward.

90
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,130
You've got some nerve.

91
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,930
Akane's smart too but she's pretty mean.

92
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,030
You've got some nerve.

93
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,730
Eiko's sweet but shy.

94
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,930
Actually, there used to be one more in our group.

95
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,130
Another close friend of ours.

96
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,630
Another member?

97
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,330
His name was Hondo,

98
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,230
he could draw really well, he wanted to go to an art college.

99
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,430
But...

100
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,330
In our senior year of high school,

101
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,630
he went to the Kanmon Bridge

102
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,130
and killed himself.

103
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,030
He committed suicide.

104
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,430
I see, he was talented but he probably felt

105
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,330
he'd already given it all he had and nothing left.

106
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,630
You're wrong.

107
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,230
His dream...

108
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,730
His dream was taken from him.

109
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,730
His dream?

110
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,130
He broke his arm.

111
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,130
And it didn't heal right.

112
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,330
I see.

113
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,730
Yesterday was his 13th memorial service.

114
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,530
So that's why you all came from Tokyo.

115
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,830
Well, that was part of the reason.

116
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,630
These two wanted to make an announcement to Eiko and me.

117
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,430
It seems they've gotten engaged.

118
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,330
That's wonderful. Congratulations.

119
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,830
Well, I realized one day that she was the only single one left.

120
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,130
How dare you!

121
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,030
I'm marrying you only because I feel sorry for you.

122
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,230
I think you two make a great couple.

123
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,730
So do I.

124
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,330
-You've got to be kidding. -You've got to be kidding.

125
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,130
Hey, come on.

126
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,130
Conan, look over there. It's so cute.

127
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,830
It's a cetacean.

128
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,730
Well, I see you're all together.

129
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,930
-Hario. -Hario...

130
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,530
Akitaya, I want to talk to you alone,

131
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,730
but I guess this is a bad time.

132
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,530
I'll be here for three to four days,

133
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,030
I'll see you later.

134
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,330
Who was that man?

135
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,830
That's Seiji Hario.

136
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,030
He was also one of our classmates.

137
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,330
Him too?

138
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,230
I wonder what he came back for anyway?

139
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,730
Probably for the memorial service.

140
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,730
Maybe he feels responsible?

141
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,530
What do you mean?

142
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,830
It's that creep's fault.

143
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,430
He's the one who broke Hondo's arm 12 years ago.

144
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,630
He's the one?

145
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:25,030
I'm sorry, I have to excuse myself.

146
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,030
I think I've worn myself out. I'm going home.

147
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,530
I'm terribly sorry.

148
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,630
I promise to be there for dinner though.

149
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,130
Excuse me.

150
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,530
I hope she's alright.

151
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,230
She didn't look very good.

152
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:46,230
Hondo was Eiko's boyfriend.

153
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,330
I guess she can't forget him.

154
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,730
She's still in love with Hondo.

155
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,430
That's why she's still single.

156
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,730
It's been 12 years already.

157
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,230
Is Akitaya married?

158
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,430
No.

159
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,630
Why?

160
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,930
I just was just curious.

161
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,630
So we'll see you all later for dinner.

162
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,930
Yes, please enjoy yourselves.

163
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,130
Since the olden days,

164
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,130
"Port of Shimonoseki International Terminal" -Shimonoseki has a history

165
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,130
of being a port city open to foreign ships.

166
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,730
Really?

167
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,930
Look, Conan.

168
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,830
Doesn't this place look like the Dragon King's palace?

169
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,430
"Akama Shrine" -Yeah, you're right.

170
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,430
"Kanmon Bridge"

171
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,830
Boy, this sure is a big bridge.

172
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,030
"Entrance Human Tunnel" -Look, that must be the tunnel

173
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,030
"(Shimonoseki side)" -Mr. Akitaya told us about.

174
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,030
-Let's go inside. -Okay.

175
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,130
"Human Tunnel B3 (Shimonoseki side)"

176
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,930
"Moji"

177
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,930
I wonder if there's a possibility this place might spring a leak.

178
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,030
I mean, we are underwater.

179
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,930
Oh for goodness sakes, dad, don't worry.

180
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:18,730
"Yamaguchi Prefecture" "Fukuoka Prefecture"

181
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,830
Look at me. I'm standing in two prefectures at the same time.

182
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,030
Peace.

183
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:33,730
"Shimonoseki"

184
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,130
Can you believe this?

185
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,830
We just walked across the Kanmon Strait.

186
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:41,930
Yeah.

187
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:47,830
"Moji Retro Town"

188
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,330
"Moji Harbor Train Station"

189
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,130
This ferry takes only five minutes

190
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,730
and even if you go through that tunnel we took and walked slowly,

191
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,730
it takes only 15 minutes one way.

192
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,830
Honshu and Kyushu are very close, aren't they?

193
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:11,130
This is one of those things you can't tell just by looking at maps.

194
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,230
Yeah.

195
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,830
The locals call balloon fish "fuku" instead of "fugu"?

196
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,230
Yes. Fuku, not fugu.

197
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,230
I see.

198
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,230
"Fuku" for happiness.

199
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,030
Your father's so funny.

200
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,530
Excuse me.

201
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,530
Hario.

202
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:44,630
Akitaya, give your company up.

203
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,030
You tell me to give it up?

204
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:50,730
I'm a consultant for a food manufacturer now.

205
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,930
They told me they want to buy your company.

206
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,530
They'll pay good money.

207
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,730
Sounds like a fair deal, don't you think?

208
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,630
You've got to be kidding.

209
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:07,030
My father started the company and he worked hard for it.

210
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,330
I'm not letting go of it so easily.

211
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,330
I could crush your company right now if I wanted to.

212
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:17,130
You're nothing, you're just garbage.

213
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,430
What'd you say?

214
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,130
Enjoy yourself tonight.

215
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,430
I'll contact you tomorrow.

216
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,630
Hario, wait.

217
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,730
Did you come back to Shimonoseki to tell him that?

218
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,330
Didn't you come for Hondo's memorial service?

219
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,430
Who's that? I don't know anyone named Hondo.

220
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,830
Hario!

221
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,430
Hey! Wait, Hario!

222
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,930
Have you no heart? Answer me, Hario.

223
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,930
Apologize to Eiko.

224
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,130
Don't touch me with your filthy hands.

225
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,030
Otsubo.

226
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,830
I don't know what you're talking about.

227
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,130
Are you alright?

228
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,430
Darn.

229
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,030
He's so mean... so mean.

230
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,330
Eiko.

231
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,030
"Next day"

232
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,330
They're all such nice people, that's why...

233
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,230
"Former Akita Company" -I kind of, feel sorry for them.

234
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,830
You mean Mr. Akitaya and his friends?

235
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:43,630
Yes, but there's nothing we can do to help.

236
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,330
Hey, you two!

237
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:49,330
I just found out it's a 15 minute bus ride to Chofu from here.

238
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,230
Do we have to go to that "Mouri Residence"?

239
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,630
Of course we do.

240
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,530
The famous Motonari Mouri is my ancestor,

241
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,330
his descendant lives there.

242
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:02,230
Are you really related to the famous Motonari Mouri?

243
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,530
I heard this the first time today.

244
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,930
I thought so.

245
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:14,230
I wonder if there was an accident or something.

246
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,630
I guess my ancestor will have to wait.

247
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:35,130
The victim's driver's license.

248
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,730
Seiji Hario, 30 years old, the address is in Tokyo.

249
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,730
Did you say Hario?

250
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,030
-It can't be... -It can't be...

251
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,130
Who are you?

252
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:47,930
The name's Kogoro Mouri, I'm a private detective in Tokyo.

253
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,330
Mouri, the famous private detective.

254
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,530
Yes, I suppose I am.

255
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,530
I've heard all about you.

256
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:56,130
I'm Kusuda with the Yamaguchi Prefectural Police.

257
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,630
I'm Anzai with the Shimonoseki Police Department.

258
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:04,430
You seem to recognize the victim.

259
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,730
Yes, sort of...

260
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:12,130
He died of a cerebral contusion caused by a blow to the back of the head.

261
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,330
The murder weapon appears to be this rock

262
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,830
but we may not be able to get any fingerprints off of it.

263
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:22,130
Approximate time of death is between 9 am and 1 pm or thereabouts.

264
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,030
They've been scraped on the ground pretty hard.

265
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,630
I wonder why?

266
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,930
You again.

267
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,430
Keep out of the way.

268
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,530
There're no signs of a struggle

269
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,330
and nothing's been stolen.

270
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,530
Which means the murderer is someone who knew him and held a grudge.

271
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,130
Yes, we think so too.

272
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,530
Whoever did it must have hated him a lot too,

273
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,530
he was hit twice.

274
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:54,230
I've got it. I know how he got those marks.

275
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,230
There's four people I think we should talk to,

276
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,030
can you get them here?

277
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,230
Do you have an idea who the killer might be?

278
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,630
Dad, you can't be serious,

279
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,230
you don't think one of them did it, do you?

280
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,530
I don't want to suspect them either.

281
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:12,130
But this guy had a lot of enemies, he would've been very, very careful.

282
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:17,930
I'm sure he came back to Shimonoseki without telling anyone.

283
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,730
Which means he got someone mad

284
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,630
after he arrived in Shimonoseki yesterday

285
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,030
and then remember the scene we witnessed last night,

286
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,430
put them together and those four start to look pretty suspicious.

287
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,830
No way.

288
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,430
"Shimonoseki Central Police Station"

289
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,430
I see.

290
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,830
So that's what happened

291
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,330
between you people and Mr. Hario last night.

292
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:45,230
Sure, we were all mad at him, but not enough to kill him...

293
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,830
Alright...

294
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,830
But for the record, I need a statement from each one of you

295
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,530
as to what you were doing this morning.

296
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,630
Mr. Akitaya, let's begin with you.

297
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,430
At nine this morning,

298
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,630
I went to the office for awhile

299
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,830
but I was worried about what Hario told me yesterday

300
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,230
about the buy-out

301
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,730
so I went to the beach alone

302
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,430
and sat in my car thinking about what to do.

303
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,230
After that, I went to Karato Ichiba,

304
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,030
which is one of our customers.

305
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,930
I'm pretty sure I got there a little before 11 am.

306
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:21,230
I was out for a drive in my car all morning, alone.

307
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:24,430
Then I got a call from Akane

308
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,130
and I went to meet her at Kaikyokan.

309
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:28,530
I think that was about 10:50 am.

310
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:34,130
The two of us went to see the performing seals show at 11 am.

311
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,530
I was with Akane until 10 am,

312
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:39,030
"Moji Retro Town" -we were shopping in Moji.

313
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,030
Then we parted company,

314
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,630
I came back to Shimonoseki

315
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,930
but I realized I'd forgotten something

316
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:51,730
so I headed back to Moji on the 11 o'clock ferry.

317
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,930
I remember seeing Akane and Eiko at Kaikyokan.

318
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,430
-Right? -Yes.

319
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,730
We were in a hurry because the show was going to start though.

320
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,330
Look, it's Otsubo.

321
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:10,230
Over there, at the ferry landing.

322
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,730
Let's see.

323
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,030
Keisuke Otsubo,

324
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,530
we're always keeping an eye on you.

325
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:24,630
If you don't believe me, look over at the Kaikyokan.

326
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,730
You're right, he's waving.

327
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,130
Right?

328
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:35,030
I see, according to your statements,

329
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,030
at the time of Mr. Hario's estimated time of death

330
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,930
which is somewhere around 9 am and 11 am,

331
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,530
Mr. Akitaya, until past 9 am to 11 am

332
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,730
and Ms. Nojima, until you got to Kaikyokan at 10:50 am,

333
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,830
and Mr. Otsubo and Ms. Isaka,

334
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,530
you parted company at 10 am, so for that one hour,

335
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,630
you all have no alibis for a short span of time.

336
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,130
Dad.

337
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,230
Now wait a minute.

338
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,830
Did you say between 9 am and 11 am?

339
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,630
At 11 am, Hario was still alive,

340
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,430
he called me on the phone.

341
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,030
What did you say?

342
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,630
He called you at 11 am?

343
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,630
-Yes. -It can't be.

344
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,330
Are you sure, Akitaya?

345
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,730
It was a weird call.

346
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,030
He said Hondo's ghost was after him

347
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,530
and he wanted me to help him.

348
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,230
A ghost was chasing him?

349
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,130
Hondo's ghost.

350
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,630
Yeah.

351
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,930
He sounded like he was crying.

352
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,630
What do you mean his ghost?

353
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,530
I've heard enough nonsense.

354
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,630
What's the matter?

355
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,230
Nothing, it was just a prank call.

356
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,930
I hadn't been with the customer very long when the call came

357
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,530
so it must've been about 11 am.

358
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,430
No mistake.

359
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:50,430
I wonder where he called me from though?

360
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:54,430
The sound of his footsteps and his voice seemed to have a strange echo.

361
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,830
A place near the murder scene which would produce an echo...

362
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,130
The pedestrian tunnel.

363
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,030
There's supposed to be a surveillance camera there.

364
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,330
I'll go check.

365
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:10,130
Mr. Mouri, if the victim did indeed make the call at 11 am,

366
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,230
then that means he was killed after that.

367
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,430
And that means...

368
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:23,430
They all have alibis for that time.

369
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:29,330
Yeah, I remember this guy.

370
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,930
He was running all around the place inside the tunnel.

371
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:36,130
I thought somebody was chasing him

372
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,230
but I didn't see anyone.

373
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,230
So I just figured he was strange.

374
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,730
Do you remember what time it was?

375
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:50,230
I'm pretty sure it was about 11 am.

376
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,830
He's sure about that?

377
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,530
Yes. He said it was so strange,

378
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:57,530
he checked the time so he could make a report.

379
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:01,830
The call he claims he got, must've been from there.

380
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,930
So the murder took place after that,

381
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,430
after 11 am.

382
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,730
That's right. I understand.

383
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:20,330
We've verified Mr. Akitaya, Ms. Nojima and Ms. Isaka's alibis.

384
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:26,730
Ms. Nojima and Ms. Isaka saw Mr. Otsubo at the ferry landing.

385
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,930
So you're all in the clear, so to speak.

386
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,730
Sorry to have kept you here so long.

387
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:36,430
We've verified your alibis so you're all free to go now.

388
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,630
I apologize for the inconvenience.

389
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,130
I'm so happy, they've been cleared.

390
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,530
Me too.

391
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:52,930
See you later, Eiko.

392
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,130
See you later.

393
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,630
I'll call you later.

394
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,630
Okay.

395
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,730
I've got it.

396
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:29,330
I know how to break their alibis now.

397
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,980
Next Conan's Hint:

398
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,740
"Palm mark"

399
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,440
The next episode concludes this case.

400
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,480
Kyushu is more assertive than Honshu.

401
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,860
-What do you mean? -Because they hesitate.
