1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,140
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,040
Black entanglement also unravels.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,640
The contact is a matter of life and death this time.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,240
What will Gin and Vodka do?

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,640
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,760
After getting a clue from Mr. Itakura who had been murdered

9
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,660
of how to get in contact with the Black Organization,

10
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,260
Dr. Agasa and I came to his villa.

11
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,960
While we were there, we get a call from Vodka.

12
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,760
Hey, what's going on?

13
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,960
You're there, aren't you?

14
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,960
I know you're at the villa.

15
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,360
Hurry up and answer me,

16
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,560
Mr. Itakura.

17
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,860
Hey!

18
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,760
Oh, sorry. It's so dark in here

19
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,160
that I was having trouble picking up the phone.

20
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,360
I pretended to be Mr. Itakura

21
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,060
and talked Vodka into making me promise to meet him

22
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,960
at the coin locker located in the basement

23
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,960
of the Kenbashi Subway Station.

24
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,060
All right, I got them.

25
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,060
But on our way there,

26
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,560
Dr. Agasa's car went flat on a mountain path.

27
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,060
So, we got a car that was passing through to give us a lift,

28
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,360
and was somehow able to make it to Tokyo, but...

29
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,260
Strange.

30
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,060
There's something fishy about them.

31
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,760
Don't tell me that...

32
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,060
Don't tell me that they're...

33
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:27,660
"Contact with the Black Organization (Desperate Battle Edition)"

34
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,960
We're almost there, you guys.

35
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,160
Your destination, Kenbashi Station.

36
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,660
But isn't that place still under construction?

37
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,160
The train won't come even if you go there.

38
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,360
We live near the station.

39
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,360
How convenient.

40
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,060
I guess so.

41
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,060
Hey, Shinichi, are you really going to go?

42
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,560
Yes.

43
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,360
I've come up with something I gotta do before that, though.

44
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,660
I don't know what you're up to,

45
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,660
but will you cut out talking secret in my car.

46
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,360
Oh, I'm so sorry.

47
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,160
Hey! I told you not to smoke!

48
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,160
Oh, that's right.

49
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,760
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,460
I'll throw it away right away.

51
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,560
Hey. Don't throw litter out of the window.

52
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,460
Throw it away in the ashtray.

53
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,460
You got loose change mixed with cigarette butts and ash.

54
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,260
No matter how rich you are,

55
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,860
you'll be punished for doing something like this.

56
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,060
I guess it can't be helped.

57
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,360
Because these two people

58
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,160
are robbers.

59
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,360
What?

60
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,360
Just what do you mean, Shinichi?

61
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,060
This is probably not his car.

62
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,860
They probably abandoned the car

63
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,560
they made their getaway with in the mountains,

64
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,560
and stole this car from somebody who happen to pass by.

65
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,360
The legal owner of this car probably doesn't smoke,

66
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,460
so the owner probably kept his loose change in the ashtray

67
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,860
to pay highway tolls with ease.

68
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,760
He put his cigarette butt inside the ashtray without realizing this,

69
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,460
so even after he did,

70
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,560
he probably kept using it as an ashtray.

71
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,860
Until they gave us a lift, that is.

72
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,160
No way, sonny.

73
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,860
I put the coins in there to spite him

74
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,160
because I hate smokers.

75
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,160
There's still other evidence that this car is not his.

76
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,660
You drove from where you could

77
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,960
judge your position from the driver's seat

78
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,260
because you're not used to driving cars

79
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,960
with steering wheels on the left, right?

80
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,960
That's why you were driving near the center line

81
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,460
and got honked at a time and again.

82
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,560
When you backed the car up,

83
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,260
you looked to the left, which is more difficult to see behind,

84
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,660
and that's probably the same reason

85
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,960
why you were having trouble shifting gears with your right hand.

86
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,760
Moreover, when turning the curve

87
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,960
you turned on the wipers instead of the blinker, right?

88
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,260
You forgot that foreign cars with the steering wheel on the left,

89
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,260
have blinkers and wipers on the opposite side

90
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,060
as that of Japanese cars.

91
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,360
There's still more.

92
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,660
When we first got into this car...

93
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,460
If you opened the left door, I could've got in right away,

94
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,860
but I was wondering why you let me in

95
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,260
from the door on the side of the road.

96
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,360
But I figured out why at the checkpoint

97
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,960
after what Officer Yamamura said.

98
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,460
The seat that you're sitting on right now

99
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,960
is stained with the blood of the other robber,

100
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,760
the man who was shot in the leg and sitting there till a while ago.

101
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,860
And that other man is probably in the trunk.

102
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,260
He's probably hiding there

103
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,060
so you could get through the checkpoint.

104
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,760
Then why did they give us a lift?

105
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,060
Of course if they were just some ordinary car thieves,

106
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,860
they wouldn't have done so.

107
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,060
But they did so to help them get through the checkpoint.

108
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,160
They can throw the police off guard into thinking

109
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,660
that it's a family trip or something,

110
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,060
if a boy and an old man are with them, right?

111
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,960
That's how I figured out who they were.

112
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,360
The only people who would give us a lift

113
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,860
despite stealing somebody else's car

114
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,860
had to be the jewelry shop robbers on the run.

115
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,060
Sonny, you're pretty smart, aren't you?

116
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,560
I'm not all that sure if being too smart at your age

117
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,460
is all that great.

118
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,160
Shinichi.

119
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,960
Well, now that you know, we've got no choice.

120
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,760
We're going to need you to stick around with us a while longer then.

121
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,960
So the problem now is,

122
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,460
where we get rid of this old man and kid?

123
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,660
How about Kenbashi Station that's under construction

124
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,560
that they wanted to go to?

125
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,760
There's nobody there.

126
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,860
Besides, the construction workers

127
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,360
won't be coming until after daybreak.

128
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,660
By the way, sonny, why didn't you tell the police

129
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,160
about us at the checkpoint?

130
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,160
You already knew by then

131
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,260
that we were the jewelry shop robbers, didn't you?

132
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,860
I didn't want to lose time.

133
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,760
If I turned you in to the police at that time,

134
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,160
we would have to go through questioning

135
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,660
because we were riding the same car.

136
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,260
Then, I would be late for my important appointment.

137
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,260
Besides, we could catch you anytime anyway.

138
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,360
Sonny, you sound pretty confident, don't you?

139
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,760
I like people like you.

140
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,860
Talk as cheeky as you like while you can.

141
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,760
Even if you cry for help,

142
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,060
I'm not going to forgive you. Don't you forget that.

143
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,560
Hey?

144
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,060
He won't be getting up for a while

145
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,960
because I fired an anesthetic needle into him.

146
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,860
Anesthetic needle?

147
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,660
Hang on!

148
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,460
You brat, what a thing to do!

149
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,860
Cut it out.

150
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,860
You may have been able to deceive the jewelry shop

151
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,360
with a dingy model gun like that,

152
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,560
but you can't fool me.

153
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,660
What? Who are you, anyway?

154
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,060
Conan Edogawa. A detective.

155
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,760
Detective?

156
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,860
Oh, right, be careful over there.

157
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,960
It's a ball firing belt.

158
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,860
Gas is inside a special rubber and it turns into a soccer ball.

159
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,860
But this rubber is very elastic.

160
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,460
When you move the dial to maximum,

161
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,160
it inflates a large as an advertisement balloon.

162
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,760
I'll be on my way, then.

163
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,160
Dr. Agasa, please call the police and tell them

164
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,060
that you caught the jewelry shop robbers.

165
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:35,060
Hey, are you really going to the place of the deal?

166
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,660
Don't worry!

167
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,560
Since this is one station away from Kenbashi Station,

168
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,860
even if the police were to come,

169
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,760
they won't call off the deal.

170
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,160
No, that's not what I'm worried about.

171
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,360
See you, then!

172
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,360
If something comes up, I'll contact you with the detective badge,

173
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,960
so don't come near Kenbashi Station till then!

174
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,860
Hey, Shinichi!

175
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,560
It's almost time.

176
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,960
Is everyone in position?

177
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,260
Okay, don't let one mouse get through.

178
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,740
"Coin Locker"

179
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,240
Hey, Itakura.

180
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,340
Itakura, that rat's not here yet.

181
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,040
A check?

182
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,540
This is the same amount we paid Itakura.

183
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,740
This is the system software that we asked Itakura to make.

184
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,240
What an idiot.

185
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,840
He gives back the money we paid him,

186
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,440
and went chicken leaving just the stuff behind.

187
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,840
Okay, I got him!

188
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,340
Yes, it's me.

189
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:42,440
That Itakura should be somewhere nearby.

190
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,040
Go get him and bring him here!

191
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,940
What? The only ones who entered the station

192
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,140
are a drunkard and a kid?

193
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,440
It can't be! Look for him!

194
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,240
Just what are you up to?

195
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,440
Boss.

196
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,140
Gin.

197
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,540
The deal's supposed to be midnight tomorrow.

198
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,940
He complained that tomorrow wasn't good for him,

199
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,840
so the time was changed.

200
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,440
So, you exchanged e-mails with him

201
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,940
and he used you to his advantage.

202
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,440
No, I'm the one who set the time.

203
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,340
He received the e-mail at his villa

204
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,540
and said that there was a black-out

205
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,140
so I talked to him directly on the phone.

206
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,340
I couldn't get rid of him

207
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,240
but got a hold of what we were after.

208
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,840
And besides, he's got a pretty bad heart.

209
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,840
He'll croak over soon either way...

210
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,140
Why do you think this was stuck on with tape?

211
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,940
To get your fingerprints.

212
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:59,540
You can't take off the tape with gloves on, you see.

213
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,940
And...

214
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,040
if the one you're waiting for doesn't show up,

215
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,440
you get irritated and light cigarettes.

216
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,940
If the saliva on this is checked,

217
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:17,740
they'd even be able to find out your blood type.

218
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,440
Boss.

219
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,540
He's even trying to track down

220
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,140
the location of the base of our operations.

221
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,940
Look. There's a communicator on the inside of the CD case.

222
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,940
He sure is some sly fox.

223
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,740
That Itakura.

224
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,940
No, it's not Itakura.

225
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,640
In a place where there is a drastic difference in temperature,

226
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,540
the sympathetic nerves are stimulated

227
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,140
and a great load is placed on the heart.

228
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,640
I don't think a guy with heart problems

229
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,340
will go out of his way to a villa

230
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,140
in the mountains in the blizzard.

231
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:57,440
Then... then, who was the guy that I talked to on the phone?

232
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,740
Probably some wiz that he hired or something.

233
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,440
But he made one mistake.

234
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,340
This case.

235
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,440
The fingerprints seem to have been wiped off,

236
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,940
but it's still warm.

237
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,640
Which means...

238
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,340
Yes. He should still be hiding somewhere nearby.

239
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,040
This is bad.

240
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,740
If things keep up as is, they'll find me.

241
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,340
What now?

242
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,940
What can I do?

243
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,440
The only place left is there.

244
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,440
A sly fox is no more than a cornered rat now.

245
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,240
Cut out your blabbering.

246
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,540
Boss.

247
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,040
There's nobody here.

248
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,440
So, what now?

249
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,640
Boss?

250
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,840
Boss?

251
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,640
There's no way a grown adult could hide in a place like this.

252
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,940
Nevermind.

253
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,840
We'll change our appearance and get out of here.

254
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,640
He may have called the police.

255
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,140
What?

256
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,940
You mean the guy who Itakura hired?

257
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,240
Yes.

258
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,940
Be careful, there's no next chance.

259
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,140
It seems that some rat is snooping around us.

260
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,440
A fox detective.

261
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,340
What now? Should I go after them?

262
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,740
No, it's too early yet.

263
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,240
They may be lying in wait after pretending to leave.

264
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,840
But what is it?

265
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,540
What are those guys trying to do anyway?

266
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,340
Ai said that they made her make queer drugs,

267
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,840
but Mr. Itakura is a system engineer.

268
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,840
He has nothing to do with drugs.

269
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,540
A software that he abandoned making for the sake of mankind.

270
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:16,140
What on earth...

271
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,040
what on earth is it about?

272
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,940
Well, good work, Dr. Agasa.

273
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,740
Yes, well, I guess.

274
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,740
I'm sure you're tired,

275
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,140
but I'm going to have to ask you to come to the station with me

276
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,540
for questioning.

277
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,540
Yes.

278
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,940
Inspector, excuse me.

279
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,440
I'll see you later, then.

280
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,740
What is it, Officer Chiba?

281
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,940
About the wound of the suspect...

282
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,340
Shinichi.

283
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,340
What's going on?

284
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,840
Shinichi.

285
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,640
Footsteps?

286
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,940
Somebody's...

287
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,940
somebody's coming.

288
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,640
Darn. My body...

289
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,140
It won't move.

290
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,440
Ai?

291
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,740
Just what are you doing in a place like this?

292
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,740
What?

293
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,840
What are you doing here yourself?

294
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,640
Both Dr. Agasa and you didn't come back even after morning came,

295
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,540
so I used your spare pursuit glasses and came looking for both of you.

296
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,740
It... it's morning?

297
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:23,140
Little lady, did you find your friend?

298
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,140
Yes.

299
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,040
Okay then, you're getting in the way of work

300
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,840
so out you go.

301
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,040
Hey, wait, Shinichi.

302
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,140
I see.

303
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,640
I fainted in there because of lack of oxygen.

304
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,640
And?

305
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,540
Just what are you doing in a place like this?

306
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,540
I didn't get to sleep, so I was sort of taking a snooze.

307
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,940
Do you think that's answering my question?

308
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,340
Oh, well, what's the difference?

309
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,540
Let's hurry home and get some grub.

310
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,240
I'm starved.

311
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,640
Hey!

312
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,340
Where's Dr. Agasa?

313
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,640
Dr. Agasa's fine. He's at the police station.

314
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,340
Now for the next news.

315
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,940
Yesterday at about 5 pm,

316
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,740
the body of a man was found at Hotel New Baker.

317
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,840
The body was identified as that of a computer graphic designer,

318
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,140
Mr. Taku Itakura, age 45.

319
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,140
Don't tell me...

320
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,140
Hey, what's up?

321
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,440
It's nothing.

322
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,500
Next Conan's Hint:

323
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,980
"The Emperor and the Empress"
