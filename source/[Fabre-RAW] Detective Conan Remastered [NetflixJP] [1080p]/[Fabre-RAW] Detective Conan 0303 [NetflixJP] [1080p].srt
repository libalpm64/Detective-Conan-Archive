1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,490
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,390
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,190
Is a case like this truly exists?

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,090
You can't recycle crime!

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,490
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,690
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,090
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,520
On that day, we set off to Akebono-cho

9
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,420
in order to arrest a serial thief.

10
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,820
Conan, let's catch the thief no matter what it takes, okay?

11
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,520
Yeah.

12
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,920
But...

13
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,620
Doesn't it feel a bit eerie?

14
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,320
To have other people take over and use what can still be used,

15
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,720
cherishing what limited resources we have,

16
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,420
I'd say it's a splendid arrangement.

17
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,920
Oh, you mean recycling.

18
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,620
But, you don't know who the stuff was being used by previously.

19
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,620
Right, Conan?

20
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,120
No need for worry, because there is nobody

21
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,820
who rubs snot on everything like you do, Genta.

22
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,320
You really do, Genta?

23
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,920
You rat!

24
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,520
What a thing to say?

25
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,320
Stop it, don't touch me!

26
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,520
Oh, there's the bus headed for Akebono-cho.

27
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,220
Oh, right!

28
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:02,320
"The Victim Returns"

29
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,220
It sure is quiet.

30
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,520
There's nobody in sight.

31
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,920
Maybe that's why the thief targets this area.

32
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,620
If you see any suspicious looking people, be careful.

33
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,720
Geez, what the heck am I doing?

34
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,420
Is it that room?

35
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,320
Wait up, Conan!

36
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,220
What's going on?

37
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,920
Excuse me!

38
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,020
-Sorry for disturbing you... -Is this okay, Conan?

39
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,520
This is...

40
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,220
The cause of death is cerebral contusion

41
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,520
from being hit in the back of his head with a blunt object.

42
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,820
The estimated time of death

43
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,520
is between 14:00 to 15:00 yesterday.

44
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,820
She had nothing on her that would help us identify her.

45
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,620
Ms. Hosono, will you please explain in detail the condition

46
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,820
in which you found the corpse?

47
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,220
Yes, sir.

48
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,620
That sofa, is what I bought yesterday

49
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,020
at sundown at a recycle shop at Beika-cho.

50
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,520
And I had it delivered here at about 10 this morning.

51
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,020
By the way, after taking a good look,

52
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,320
the sheet was a little out of place

53
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,120
so I attempted to put it back in place.

54
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,620
I found that lady inside the sofa.

55
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,420
I see.

56
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,420
And do you have any idea who the victim is?

57
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,120
Not at all.

58
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,420
Where were you yesterday between the hours of 14:00 and 15:00?

59
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,320
Are you suspecting me?

60
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,320
No, no, it's just routine procedure to ask.

61
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,220
I was at the movies yesterday afternoon!

62
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,320
Was somebody else with you?

63
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,320
I went alone.

64
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,020
I wonder if Inspector Megure suspects her.

65
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,120
Yeah.

66
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,420
"402, Sanae Hosono"

67
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,620
There are two things that are thinkable.

68
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,720
Ms. Sanae Hosono killed the victim

69
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,820
and made it look like the corpse was inside

70
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,720
the sofa that was delivered.

71
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,120
The other is, a sofa with the corpse inside it is

72
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,620
was delivered just like she said.

73
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:47,120
But when we went over there, she really looked surprised and pale!

74
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,820
It didn't look like she was putting on an act at all!

75
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,220
Right.

76
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,420
Yeah.

77
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,820
It's the job of the police to consider all possibilities.

78
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,820
But...

79
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,920
Inspector, the old lady's shoes were also inside the sofa.

80
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,220
I wonder why she wasn't wearing her shoes.

81
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,420
When she was killed, she was probably not wearing her shoes.

82
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,920
I see! Which means she was killed in the room.

83
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,420
If she is the culprit, the site of the crime is in this room.

84
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,920
Officer Takagi, go and question the neighbourhood!

85
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,020
Yes, sir!

86
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,120
Inspector.

87
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,820
What... the room next door...

88
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,020
Excuse me, may I ask your name?

89
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,720
Tokunaga.

90
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,520
Did something happen?

91
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,620
Well, at your next door neighbour, Ms. Hosono's room,

92
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,320
a corpse was found in the sofa.

93
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
What?

94
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,220
And, Mr. Tokunaga, were you in your room

95
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,120
between the hours of 14:00 to15:00 yesterday?

96
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,620
Yes.

97
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,520
I work in the evening.

98
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,920
Around 15:00,

99
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,420
did you hear any strange sounds or voices from next door?

100
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,420
Please try to remember.

101
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:22,220
Come to think of it, I sort of heard somebody arguing.

102
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,120
You heard somebody arguing?

103
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,420
Yes.

104
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,020
And, what was the argument about?

105
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,120
I'm not sure of the details.

106
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,220
Oh, all right. Thank you.

107
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,220
I think I'll be asking you about it again later.

108
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,320
Yes, sir.

109
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,120
I wonder if what he said just now is true.

110
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,920
It's sort of hard to believe, isn't it?

111
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,820
The thing about her going to the movies seems to be a lie.

112
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,520
Inspector.

113
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,120
What is it?

114
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,620
I would like to go ask around the recycle shop.

115
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,620
I got curious on what the children was talking about.

116
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,520
Officer Takagi.

117
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,120
Okay.

118
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,220
Yeah, please do so then.

119
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,320
Yes, sir!

120
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,120
Oh, that sofa.

121
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,820
It's an item that we bought from a customer yesterday.

122
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,720
Yesterday?

123
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,020
You mean you bought it and put it out for sale right away?

124
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:37,520
Yes, we put the items that we purchase out for sale right away.

125
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,220
That way, we can sell the item for a cheaper price.

126
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,220
What about after Ms. Hosono bought it?

127
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,920
It was here right through till closing time.

128
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,520
Then it was loaded on the truck for delivery.

129
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,320
Is there any possibility that someone from outside

130
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,220
can get near the truck?

131
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,020
That's impossible

132
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,120
because the truck is parked inside the warehouse.

133
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,020
And, of course, the warehouse is locked.

134
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,220
Oh, is that so...

135
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,220
Which means that...

136
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:13,020
The old lady was in there already when it was purchased.

137
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,420
Does that mean that the previous owner of that sofa

138
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,020
is the culprit?

139
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,420
The fact is, that sofa

140
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,220
is not something that we bought from a customer.

141
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,220
What?

142
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,420
But, Mr. Hirose, I thought you said

143
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,520
that you were told to take the sofa, even if it were for free.

144
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,920
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,020
Yesterday afternoon, on the way back

146
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,320
after I went to purchase items in several places in town,

147
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,820
I think it was around 16:00...

148
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,020
What's the matter, Mr. Hirose?

149
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,420
Look at that, what a waste.

150
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,320
It still looks very usable.

151
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
You can say that again.

152
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,820
You picked it up at a trash dump that you happened to pass?

153
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,020
Right.

154
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,420
But manager, I felt it so wasteful to be thrown away like that

155
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,220
when it still looked so usable, so I...

156
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,720
I'm sorry I lied.

157
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,320
Well, I do understand your feelings of wanting to cherish things.

158
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,720
But, if you picked it up from a trash dump...

159
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,020
We have no idea who the culprit is.

160
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,720
Right.

161
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,620
But, Officer Takagi...

162
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,020
It's hard to think that

163
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,420
the culprit carried the corpse a long way, isn't it?

164
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,920
Wait a minute.

165
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,720
Where is the trash dump that you picked that sofa up from?

166
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,420
If I'm not mistaken, I think it was...

167
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,920
Akebono-cho, on 3rd Street.

168
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,020
Akebono-cho!

169
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,620
We're back where we started.

170
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,420
In other words, that old lady...

171
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:18,120
Yeah, she was left here about 16:00 yesterday,

172
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,420
and via the recycle shop,

173
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:25,220
came back to the original place about 10 this morning.

174
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,920
I'm sure the culprit is living somewhere near here,

175
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,220
but how do we go about looking for the culprit...

176
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:36,220
Besides, why did the culprit put the body into a sofa in the trash dump?

177
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,320
Why else?

178
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,120
Right, the culprit didn't think that

179
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,020
anyone would pick up a sofa that was thrown away.

180
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,120
But!

181
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,020
Oh, there you go again Conan with your "Buts".

182
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:52,520
It's a bad habit of yours of not looking at the situation as is.

183
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,120
Talk for yourself.

184
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,520
Mr. Tokunaga was a little creepy.

185
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,220
I saw him at that family restaurant this morning,

186
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,620
where he was drinking and all smiles.

187
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,820
Oh, so he smiles?

188
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,120
He always looks so super square.

189
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,120
So, something really good must've happened?

190
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,520
Tokunaga?

191
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,120
He's the one that we saw this morning, right?

192
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,220
Ms. Sanae Hosono's next door neighbour.

193
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,620
What're you doing here?

194
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,120
Inspector Megure.

195
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,620
What're you doing here, Inspector Megure?

196
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:35,020
I came to tell Ms. Hosono that her alibi's been backed up.

197
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,620
The person at the theater remembered her.

198
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,220
I'm glad!

199
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,120
But, if so...

200
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,320
The voice that Mr. Tokunaga said he heard,

201
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,920
must've been a mistake or something.

202
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,220
A mistake?

203
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,520
The thing is,

204
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,720
while we were tracing the source of where the sofa came from,

205
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,320
we ended back to where we started.

206
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,720
But, there is no mistake about the fact that

207
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,420
the victim was put inside the sofa here.

208
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,220
I'll go look for a witness.

209
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,220
Yeah, do that, will you?

210
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,020
I got it! I figured out who the culprit is!

211
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,120
Are you serious, Mitsuhiko?

212
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,220
Yes!

213
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,520
Mr. Tokunaga's testimony about having heard an argument

214
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,420
is probably not a mistake!

215
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,420
But, just a while ago, Inspector Megure...

216
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,520
So, the culprit is Mr. Tokunaga!

217
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,520
What?

218
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,220
He's the culprit?

219
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:50,590
It's just as those ladies were saying after all!

220
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,490
This morning, that man called Tokunaga

221
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,490
seemed to be in a super good mood.

222
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,390
So, my deduction's been backed up.

223
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,890
Mr. Tokunaga must be the suspect!

224
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:03,890
Conan, when a culprit wants to hide the corpse,

225
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,990
what do you think the purpose of the culprit usually is?

226
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:09,090
The culprit doesn't want anyone to find the corpse, right?

227
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,090
If the body is found, the victim will be identified.

228
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:15,090
And the people who are around the victim will be thoroughly checked.

229
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:18,590
The hands of the police will eventually reach the culprit.

230
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,490
The corpse is hidden to prevent this.

231
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,890
Exactly.

232
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,190
But if the culprit really wants to hide the body,

233
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:29,790
the body could be buried in the mountains, or sunk into the sea.

234
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,990
However, why didn't the culprit do so this time?

235
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,490
Yeah, that's the point's that hard to understand.

236
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,890
Right.

237
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,490
There is only one answer.

238
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:45,090
The culprit wanted to go hide the corpse in the mountains this time too.

239
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,890
But, the culprit had reasons for not being able to go.

240
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:51,490
So, what was the culprit's reason for not doing so?

241
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,990
He was saying that

242
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,290
he works from sundown.

243
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,590
That's why he couldn't go far to hide the body!

244
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:05,590
I see. Adults can't take off from work so...

245
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,190
Right, Officer Takagi?

246
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,990
Yeah...

247
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:15,290
That's why the culprit hid the corpse inside the sofa for the time being.

248
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,090
For the time being?

249
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,090
Yes!

250
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,190
The culprit was going to throw it away somewhere

251
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,790
after coming back from work!

252
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,990
But, when he returned from work...

253
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,790
Before the culprit could get to the sofa,

254
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,390
the truck of the recycle shop had already taken the sofa away!

255
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,490
Right.

256
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:40,890
I'm sure the culprit was surprised when he got home from work.

257
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,590
Because the sofa had suddenly disappeared.

258
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:48,890
And after he was surprised, delight filled his heart.

259
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:53,390
Because after all someone had taken care of the corpse for him.

260
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,190
He was spared the trouble of getting rid of the corpse himself.

261
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:00,490
Unable to hold back his joy, he went to celebrate on his own.

262
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,090
However, when he got back to the condo,

263
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,990
he found out the worse had happened.

264
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,490
The corpse that had disappeared somewhere

265
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,390
was found in the room next to his.

266
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:19,190
But the culprit who finds that the police suspects Sanae Hosono,

267
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:24,890
the one who first finds the corpse, remarks...

268
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:29,790
"Come to think of it, I heard the voices of people arguing."

269
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,490
It was no mistake,

270
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,890
but rather a lie to frame Sanae Hosono up as the culprit.

271
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,890
Everything falls right into place, Mitsuhiko!

272
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,190
Wow!

273
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,890
Nah, it's really no big deal.

274
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,490
What's the matter, Conan?

275
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,790
Even if the culprit had to go to work,

276
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:55,990
why did he have to go out of the way to move the corpse?

277
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,390
If he left it in his room until he got back,

278
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,190
nobody would've seem him, right?

279
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,190
Now that you mentioned it.

280
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:09,990
What did we come here to Akebono-cho today for in the first place?

281
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,690
To arrest the serial thief that's been raiding the houses

282
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,490
in this vicinity, right?

283
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:19,090
The culprit was afraid that the thief would break into his house!

284
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:23,990
I see! If the thief breaks in and finds the dead old lady,

285
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,690
the police may be contacted!

286
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,190
Exactly!

287
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:32,490
That's why he couldn't leave it in the house!

288
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,690
Your deduction is perfect, Mitsuhiko!

289
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,690
No, that won't do after all, Mitsuhiko.

290
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,290
Huh?

291
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,290
Think about it.

292
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,690
The possibility of someone witnessing him hiding the corpse

293
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,690
is higher than the possibility of a thief breaking into his house,

294
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,690
don't you think?

295
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,990
Besides, will he really be happy when he finds out that

296
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,990
the sofa where the corpse is hidden disappears?

297
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,890
I think it would be more natural for him to worry

298
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,790
that it may have been discovered by the police, don't you?

299
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,890
Besides, it wouldn't hurt to take a day off from work,

300
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,690
if just for a day.

301
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,790
In other words, deducing Mr. Tokunaga as being the culprit

302
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,190
is all an illusion created in your head.

303
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,690
This is homicide,

304
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,190
let's think about it more seriously, okay?

305
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,090
I'm thinking about it seriously too!

306
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:32,790
Just who is the one that is overtaken by illusion?

307
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,390
Although you say, normally this and normally that,

308
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,090
I'm sure there a people who get anxious over

309
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,390
thieves breaking into their houses.

310
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,490
I'm sure there are people who think themselves lucky

311
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,890
about the corpse disappearing too, don't you?

312
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,890
If someone who had never taken a day off from work does so,

313
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,890
the people around him may get suspicious.

314
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,990
Therefore, he may go to work as usual.

315
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,590
That's possible too, isn't it?

316
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,990
According to the manager of the condo, it seems that Mr. Tokunaga

317
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,990
is running a small pub in the neighbouring town.

318
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,390
It seems he's having a tough time,

319
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,290
but he seems to be running the pub without resting even one day.

320
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,390
The manager also commented that

321
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,990
Mr. Tokunaga is a square and timid personality.

322
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:22,790
It's just as Mitsuhiko had portrayed him.

323
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,490
Since he has to make preparations before opening the shop,

324
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,390
it seems he always goes out around this time.

325
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,190
It's 15:00 now.

326
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:35,290
But, no matter how timid he is, I wonder if he would be afraid of

327
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,190
a thief that he's not sure will break in or not.

328
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:42,490
Serial break ins have been reported in this area,

329
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:47,090
so please be sure to lock your doors when going out.

330
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,090
This is the Akebono Police Station.

331
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,290
Hey!

332
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,190
Please stop!

333
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,590
This is Officer Takagi from police headquarters!

334
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,090
Did you patrol this area yesterday too?

335
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,290
Yes, sir. But maybe yesterday we patrolled this area

336
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:03,090
about 10 minutes earlier than today.

337
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,690
Officer Takagi!

338
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,790
Yeah! So, that's the story!

339
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:13,490
Mr. Tokunaga was probably panic after killed the victim

340
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:18,190
and heard the voice from this police car.

341
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,490
This is the Akebono Police Station.

342
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:26,490
Serial break ins have been reported in this area.

343
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,190
Therefore, you were frightened

344
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,790
and hid the corpse inside the sofa

345
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,990
that you found in the trash dump nearby.

346
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,790
Isn't that right, Mr. Tokunaga?

347
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:44,590
I...

348
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:48,090
I owed that old lady money.

349
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:55,690
And I asked her to wait just another week for me to pay her back.

350
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,690
Then, she came to my condo and yelled at me

351
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,390
saying that if I didn't pay her back by the due date,

352
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:03,590
she would take this shop away from me.

353
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,590
That's why I...

354
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,790
That's why I lost my temper and...

355
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,890
I'm sorry.

356
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:19,390
Mr. Tokunaga, please come to the station with me.

357
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,590
Yes, sir.

358
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,390
You did it, Mitsuhiko!

359
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,490
Great!

360
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,190
Good deduction work, Mitsuhiko,

361
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:31,890
thanks to being free of preconceived opinions.

362
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:12,090
What? The thief who had been breaking into house in Akebono-cho

363
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,790
was arrested long time ago?

364
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:17,490
Yeah. Last week a man who was arrested on charges of theft

365
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:20,490
confessed to the other crimes as well.

366
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,990
Oh, boy.

367
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:25,090
We were all out to get him and then...

368
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:28,590
What a bummer, I even lost out on bus fare!

369
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:31,590
Which means that Mr. Tokunaga

370
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,190
didn't have to go out of the way

371
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,690
to hide the corpse in the sofa at the trash dump?

372
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,390
Yeah, if he left the corpse inside his room,

373
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:42,790
maybe the case would've never come to light.

374
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,390
He sure is an unlucky character, isn't he?

375
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,290
You can say that again.

376
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:56,990
Gee, it's a homicide case and no laughing matter.

377
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,660
Next Conan's Hint:

378
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,960
"Map symbol"
