1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,870
What lies in one's heart is a mystery to us all.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,770
Star and snow glitter on the two.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,370
Snow falls silently at night.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,470
A frightening suit of armor looms up from the darkness.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,970
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,870
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,770
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,130
In the warring era,

9
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,730
military commander Hidetomo Okikatsu advised

10
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,930
his lord Genbu Ohara, who was a tyrant,

11
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,530
to stop oppressing the people.

12
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,730
But this angered Genbu

13
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,330
and he ordered the Okikatsu clan to be disbanded.

14
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,430
Filled with despair,

15
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,830
Hidetomo put on his suit of armor

16
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,630
and killed Genbu,

17
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,830
then he committed suicide by stabbing himself in the throat.

18
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,030
Hidetomo's ghost still wanders about

19
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,830
and it is said that whoever sees it will die an untimely death.

20
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,830
This Okikatsu Festival is held

21
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,830
to appease the spirit of Hidetomo Okikatsu

22
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,130
For your information, the rainwear of straw worn in the dance

23
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,230
symbolizes the suit of armor worn by Hidetomo

24
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,930
when he killed himself.

25
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,730
Good grief.

26
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,930
The hot springs just ever that mountain,

27
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,930
why do we have to sit through this boring festival?

28
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,630
But this is so surreal.

29
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,030
Good grief.

30
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,530
This is the 500th anniversary of Hidetomo's death.

31
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,930
Please relax and enjoy the evening.

32
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,730
Thanks.

33
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,830
Are you satisfied now, Ran?

34
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,830
We'd better start heading for the hot spring already.

35
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,530
Excuse me.

36
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,630
I just heard that the road to the hot springs

37
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,830
have been closed due to heavy snow.

38
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,330
Are you sure?

39
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,130
What're we going to do, dad?

40
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,730
Don't ask me.

41
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,830
I guess we'll just have to find some place

42
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,030
around here to spend the night.

43
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,830
But I didn't see any inns around here.

44
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,230
Excuse me. Maybe I can help,

45
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,230
there's a house up ahead owned by the Daimon family.

46
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,330
I'm heading there now.

47
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,230
You can come with me if you want.

48
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,930
Thanks.

49
00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:00,330
"Frightening Legend On A Snowy Night (Part 1)"

50
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,330
Are you sure it'll be all right for us to go along?

51
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,330
Yes. In fact, I'd prefer you come with me.

52
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,430
Huh?

53
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,530
The head of the Daimon family

54
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,830
is the president of Daimon Industries.

55
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,630
That company's well known.

56
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,230
The president is a man who'd do anything for money.

57
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,530
He's even a tyrant in his own home, he and his oldest son,

58
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,330
who is next in line to be president, are always arguing.

59
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,430
And that son's wife prefers partying to helping in the home.

60
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,030
I've heard rumors that a divorce is imminent.

61
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,630
You sure know a lot.

62
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:35,330
I'm the second son. My name's Yoshiro Daimon.

63
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,830
I haven't been home for quite awhile now.

64
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,330
This is quite a mansion.

65
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,330
They must get a lot taken.

66
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,530
-Huh? -In taxes.

67
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,930
Kazuki, I'm home.

68
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,730
You're looking good.

69
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,130
Yoshiro. Why'd you come back now after all this time?

70
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,730
Is that any way to greet your younger brother?

71
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,630
We haven't seen each other for five years.

72
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:12,630
Young master, please come inside.

73
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,430
Hatsuho, you keep out of this.

74
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,630
Yoshiro, who are these people?

75
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,630
I met them at the Hidetomo Festival.

76
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,230
It was snowing heavily and they didn't have a place to stay.

77
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,130
You come back out of the blue

78
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,230
and you bring strangers with you on top of that!

79
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,030
Forgive me.

80
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,130
I forgot to introduce myself. I'm from Tokyo and I...

81
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,230
What's all the commotion?

82
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,430
Father.

83
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,830
Yoshiro, you've finally come home, I'm so happy.

84
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,830
Good evening, father.

85
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,130
You over there,

86
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,830
aren't you the famous private detective, Kogoro Mouri?

87
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,930
That's right.

88
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,730
Private detective?

89
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,830
Kogoro Mouri...

90
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,430
I'm one of your greatest fans.

91
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,330
This must be destiny. Please do spend the night.

92
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,330
Hatsuho.

93
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,430
Prepare the guest rooms for Mr. Mouri's party and Yoshiro.

94
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,730
Yes, sir.

95
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,130
Please follow me.

96
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,630
Mr. Mouri, you and your party can stay in this room.

97
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,330
Master Yoshiro, your room will be down the hall.

98
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,330
You can enter the garden through this back door.

99
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,330
It is very pretty. Everything is white with snow.

100
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,930
Please walk through it.

101
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,330
Thank you. We will.

102
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,430
Please forgive my brother and his wife.

103
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,830
They behaved terribly back there.

104
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,430
You don't have to apologize.

105
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,330
We're the ones who barged in unexpectedly.

106
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:50,030
Excuse me, madam. Where's the toilet?

107
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,730
It's right down the hall, there, at the far end.

108
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:57,330
The light switch is hard to find, so I'll go with you.

109
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,330
Thank you, I'd appreciate that.

110
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,830
I'll prepare some tea so please relax.

111
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,930
You needn't bother.

112
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,830
But I'd sure appreciate some.

113
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,530
I'll join you later.

114
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,730
This.

115
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,230
Thanks.

116
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,130
For goodness sakes, dad.

117
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,430
Here it is, the toilet.

118
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,830
Thank you. This sure is a huge house.

119
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,430
It certainly is.

120
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,630
What's down that way?

121
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,230
Everyone else's rooms.

122
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,530
Master Kazuki's audio room is down the hall

123
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,430
and the kitchen is in front of it.

124
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,730
Next to the kitchen,

125
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,630
we have a door that leads into the garden.

126
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,830
You can go in now.

127
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,530
We wouldn't want you to have an accident.

128
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,730
Right!

129
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,330
This is a very impressive home you have.

130
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:57,030
I am honored to be staying in a place like this.

131
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,630
No, this is just an old place.

132
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,830
We're always having to repair things.

133
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,130
Sir, madam says she isn't feeling well.

134
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,130
She's resting.

135
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:12,130
What, again! And just when Mr. Mouri is visiting.

136
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,430
Please don't get upset on my account.

137
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:18,430
I don't think mother can be bothered with dinner either tonight.

138
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,330
Kayoko!

139
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,930
Don't be like that. I think it'd be better if they knew.

140
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,130
Every year on the anniversary of Hidetomo's death,

141
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,230
at 12 midnight, my mother-in-law sits

142
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,430
in front of the altar in her room praying.

143
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,330
Supposedly, that's the time he killed himself.

144
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,830
I heard her once and it sounded so eerie.

145
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,830
Ever since then, whenever this day comes,

146
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,730
I climb into bed and cover my head with the blanket.

147
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,930
Mother really is quite frail.

148
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,430
I wish you'd be more considerate.

149
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,330
Kazuki!

150
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,530
You needn't worry about your mother.

151
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,830
Rather than spending your time worrying about her,

152
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,430
you should worry about your job!

153
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,130
Is the food to your liking?

154
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:01,130
It's delicious. The rice is good, too.

155
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,230
It is customary in this household

156
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,430
to cook the rice over a "kamado".

157
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:08,830
Really? I've never had kamado cooked rice before.

158
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,630
The burnt part was delicious!

159
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,980
By the way, father.

160
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,380
About the appointment of the next president...

161
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,080
We're in the middle of dinner.

162
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,780
We'll discuss that later.

163
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,180
Yoshiro, what are you doing now?

164
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,980
I'm a guitarist.

165
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,180
What? Such foolishness, quit that immediately

166
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,580
and come back home.

167
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,780
I think it's about time you started

168
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,880
considering helping my business.

169
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,380
Yoshiro.

170
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,280
What kind of music do you play?

171
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,580
Flamenco.

172
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,380
Really? I'd like to hear you play.

173
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,380
Mr. Mouri. Excuse me.

174
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,080
May I have your autograph?

175
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,780
The truth is, I'm a big fan of yours too.

176
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,980
You are, are you? It'd be my pleasure then!

177
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,780
-I'm so thrilled! -Yippee!

178
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,480
What a happy go lucky pair.

179
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,280
It seems the atmosphere in this house

180
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,680
has also brightened up thanks to Hatsuho.

181
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,780
Oh, it's just that I don't let things upset me.

182
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,280
Hatsuho, how long have you been working here?

183
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,180
Just over a year.

184
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,580
Your family's a very old family

185
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,080
and there's so much to remember, I'm having a hard time.

186
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,280
Oh, I see you have another one.

187
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,780
Yes, this is for Master Yoshiro.

188
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,680
Huh? You want my autograph too?

189
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,780
Of course. After all,

190
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,680
you're going to be a very famous guitarist someday!

191
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,680
I hope so.

192
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
If you become famous,

193
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,480
signing autographs will be the least of your worries,

194
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,080
Look at me!

195
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,380
I'll remember that.

196
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,580
Huh? You're left handed.

197
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,880
-Yes. -What are these figures?

198
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,480
I gave you the benefit of the doubt

199
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
and waited until the very last minute

200
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,580
but I guess it was a waste of time.

201
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,480
I can't relinquish my position to you at this rate!

202
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,380
Well, dad, your methods are rather high handed themselves.

203
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,680
I didn't ask you for your opinion!

204
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,480
Then, who are you going to name as president instead of me?

205
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,580
You're both two of a kind.

206
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,180
I came back here today

207
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,580
because I wanted to settle things with my dad once and for all.

208
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,380
Settle things?

209
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,580
Dad wants me to become one of the company's executives.

210
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,380
But everything is money, money, money.

211
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,380
He doesn't even try to understand how other people feel.

212
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,580
I left five years ago because I hated how pushy he was.

213
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,880
Well, he does look very overbearing.

214
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,480
The truth is, I'm going to Spain next month.

215
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,580
I don't intend on coming back to Japan

216
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,180
until I've become a first rate guitarist,

217
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,180
I may never see my father again.

218
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,080
That's why I thought I'd better come back

219
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,680
and try to make him accept the way I choose to live my life.

220
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,180
That's what you'd like us to believe. Isn't it, Yoshiro?

221
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,280
But the truth is you came back

222
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,580
to seize control of the company, didn't you?

223
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,280
You're out of your mind!

224
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,380
I'd never have left in the first place if I intended to do that!

225
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,580
I wonder about that.

226
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,880
Madam.

227
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,580
What's all the fuss?

228
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,080
Gosh, everybody makes me so mad!

229
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,680
I'm going back to my place!

230
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,980
I almost forgot. Mr. Mouri.

231
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,880
I'd like to show you something interesting. It'll lift your spirits.

232
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,280
That's where I live.

233
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,680
I see. This is very nice!

234
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,880
It's always so noisy at the main house

235
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,580
so I spend most of my time here relaxing.

236
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,280
Look at that.

237
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,180
That suit of armor looks so imposing.

238
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,080
You're right.

239
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,380
What do you think? Impressive, isn't it?

240
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,380
That's my pride and joy.

241
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,580
It's Hidetomo Okikatsu's suit of armor.

242
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,680
What?

243
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,980
So this belongs to the festival's hero.

244
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,480
So it's in your possession.

245
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,180
That suit of armor is cursed.

246
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,180
Tatsuko!

247
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,480
What are you doing here?

248
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,980
Hidetomo's spirit still roams this earth.

249
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:17,380
Those who see it are said to die untimely deaths.

250
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,780
These are so Hidetomo's feet don't get cold.

251
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,480
Please use these socks.

252
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,280
Stop that! I don't approve!

253
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,880
How dare you say that to me?

254
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,680
I pray to Hidetomo on the anniversary of his death every year

255
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,580
and give offerings in penance of the horrible way you do business!

256
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,680
So don't you ever say anything like that to me again!

257
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,280
Tonight is the 500th anniversary of Hidetomo's death.

258
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,280
Something might happen tonight.

259
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,380
Here in this very house.

260
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,740
Mr. Mouri.

261
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,240
I've decided to postpone talking to my father until tomorrow.

262
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,940
I see.

263
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,640
Why don't we drink more of that local sake

264
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,040
since we have the time?

265
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,040
Sounds good to me!

266
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,440
Yoshiro!

267
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,440
Mother. I thought you were asleep.

268
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,940
Yoshiro, Hidetomo must have brought you here tonight.

269
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,640
You're the only one who can protect this family.

270
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,740
Take this.

271
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,940
My mother was keeping articles like these.

272
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,440
Allow me.

273
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,140
December 10th 1996, Kenichi Saegusa,

274
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,540
president of Saegusa Industries commits suicide.

275
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,740
Daimon Industries used dirty methods

276
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,540
to deliberately drive the company into bankruptcy.

277
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,840
This was behind the suicide!

278
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,240
That's the way father always does business.

279
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,340
But you don't know for sure that this article was completely right.

280
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,540
I understand you saw the suit of armor in father's room.

281
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,040
Yes.

282
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,640
The man who committed suicide...

283
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,340
He was the original owner.

284
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:23,140
The day that man committed suicide, December 10th, that's today.

285
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,240
His factory was left untouched, it's falling apart.

286
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,940
Some people have seen his ghost there.

287
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,540
Spooky, isn't it?

288
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,340
Hidetomo Okikatsu and the owner of his suit of armor,

289
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,740
the anniversary of both their death is December 10th, unbelievable.

290
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,440
Could it be the curse of the suit of armor?

291
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,440
It's mere coincidence. That's all!

292
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,340
Besides, time's a wasting.

293
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,640
Let's enjoy our drinks and take in the beautiful snowy scenery.

294
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,640
It's stopped snowing.

295
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,940
It's so beautiful.

296
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,940
If only the snow could fall in our hearts

297
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,240
and cover everything up like this, it would be so nice.

298
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,340
I nearly forgot.

299
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,140
Your beddings been laid out so you can turn in.

300
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,940
Thank you, Hatsuho.

301
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,340
Come on, dad. You must be tired after all that driving.

302
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,440
You'd better get some rest.

303
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,740
Hey!

304
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,440
-I'm going to go get a drink. -What?

305
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,240
I meant water.

306
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,240
You'll get the inheritance money if your father dies, won't you?

307
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,540
But I don't think he's going to die very soon.

308
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,440
You're right.

309
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,940
What I don't understand is

310
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,440
why did that Yoshiro come back so suddenly.

311
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,840
He's not leaving Japan, that's a lie!

312
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,040
I'll bet he's going to try and make good with your father.

313
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,840
There wouldn't be any trouble

314
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,740
if only you could automatically become president.

315
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,440
And what about you? You married me for the money, didn't you?

316
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,440
How dare you!

317
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,640
If you get a hangover and we have to spend another night here,

318
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,240
-I'll be very angry! -Hey, Conan!

319
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,740
Ran here's in a real bad mood,

320
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,940
we'd better get to bed and fast!

321
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,440
Dad, you're talking too loud!

322
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,940
Pops, let's go to bed!

323
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,840
Are you sleeping in the audio room again tonight?

324
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,940
You love music more than me.

325
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,140
Hatsuho. I'd like a cup of my usual coffee.

326
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,140
Could you bring it to the audio room?

327
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,140
Yes, sir.

328
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,640
Nanmandabu...

329
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,640
Master Daimon is...

330
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,040
What on earth's the matter?

331
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,240
Master Daimon is dead in his room!

332
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,740
Are you sure?

333
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,040
You kids, stay here!

334
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,140
Conan!

335
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,940
Is something wrong?

336
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,040
Master Yoshiro.

337
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,140
Your father, in his room...

338
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,740
Father?

339
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,940
Father!

340
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,940
Don't go inside!

341
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,940
It looks like he was stabbed once

342
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,540
in the chest with a sharp object.

343
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,140
He died instantaneously.

344
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,040
Pops, look!

345
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,640
The suit of armor is gone!

346
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,540
And so is the sword.

347
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,540
It appears Mr. Daimon was killed

348
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,040
while he was having a glass of brandy.

349
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,440
Who did this?

350
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,040
Even the socks...

351
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,540
This is the only entrance to this place

352
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:47,040
and on top of that, there were no footprints leading here.

353
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,340
What's that?

354
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
I get it.

355
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,940
That door hid the footprints.

356
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,840
And on the way here,

357
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,940
the man made hill and hedges cast a shadow over the footprints,

358
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,540
that's why we didn't see them.

359
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,840
Sheet?

360
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,040
Gosh!

361
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,440
Why are you always wandering around like this?

362
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,640
There's a huge footprint over there!

363
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,540
It doesn't look like a human one.

364
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,840
What in the world is this?

365
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,340
I told you.

366
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,740
What huge footprints.

367
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,440
Hidetomo.

368
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,740
It's Hidetomo! I saw him!

369
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,840
I saw him walking around in his suit of armor last night.

370
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,740
But the curse didn't fall on me although I saw him,

371
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,540
it fell on Genichiro instead.

372
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,640
At any rate,

373
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,540
these footprints seem to lead to the back door of the main house.

374
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,540
We'll go back to the main house the way we came

375
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,640
but make sure you don't erase any of those footprints,

376
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,940
let's see where those footprints lead.

377
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,840
The killer came this way?

378
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,340
Kazuki!

379
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,240
He said he was coming here to listen to music

380
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,340
-but he never returned. -What?

381
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,940
Kazuki...

382
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,740
There another way in?

383
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,740
No, there isn't.

384
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,740
Gosh! I guess we'll have to break it down!

385
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,340
Mr. Mouri...

386
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,740
Kazuki...

387
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,040
Don't go in there!

388
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,640
Hidetomo was angry after all.

389
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,440
I don't believe it.

390
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,740
Kazuki!

391
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,440
It's Hidetomo's curse. The curse!

392
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,240
No, this is not curse.

393
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,940
But who in the world did this and how?

394
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,160
Next Conan's Hint:

395
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,040
"Gash"
