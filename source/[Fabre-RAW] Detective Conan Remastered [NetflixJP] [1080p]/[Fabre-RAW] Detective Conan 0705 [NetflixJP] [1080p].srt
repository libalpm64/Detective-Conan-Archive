1
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:03,983
We got involved in the murder case

2
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:07,055
that occurred on the Bell Tree Express.

3
00:00:08,155 --> 00:00:11,255
The case was solved.

4
00:00:11,255 --> 00:00:14,955
Furthermore, it was found that the man with the burn

5
00:00:14,955 --> 00:00:18,555
who was going around on board the train was Vermouth.

6
00:00:18,555 --> 00:00:21,055
In the meantime, a dark shadow closed in on Ai

7
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:23,755
who had returned to an adult's form after drinking the antidote.

8
00:00:31,555 --> 00:00:34,955
Just as expected of Hell Angel's daughter.

9
00:00:34,955 --> 00:00:37,255
You look alike.

10
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:43,355
How do you do?

11
00:00:45,055 --> 00:00:46,555
Bourbon...

12
00:00:46,555 --> 00:00:49,455
This is my code name.

13
00:00:49,455 --> 00:00:52,355
With the cooperation of my mother, Subaru Okiya,

14
00:00:52,355 --> 00:00:55,655
and the helping hand from Thief Kid who came to check the place out,

15
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:59,755
we succeeded in protecting Ai from those guys. However...

16
00:01:08,555 --> 00:01:12,355
If so, couldn't you have explained it beforehand?

17
00:01:12,355 --> 00:01:13,655
Well...

18
00:01:13,655 --> 00:01:15,355
I was really surprised.

19
00:01:15,355 --> 00:01:17,355
I desperately fled into Room B of carriage number 7

20
00:01:17,355 --> 00:01:19,155
because the door was open,

21
00:01:19,155 --> 00:01:22,055
then found your mother waiting for me there.

22
00:01:22,055 --> 00:01:24,355
And she told me, "Leave the rest to me".

23
00:01:24,355 --> 00:01:26,655
I had no idea of what was going on!

24
00:01:26,655 --> 00:01:29,655
On top of that, you came into that room later,

25
00:01:29,655 --> 00:01:32,071
and pushed your cell phone on me.

26
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:34,073
Was I supposed to tell you

27
00:01:34,073 --> 00:01:36,075
that Thief Kid disguised as you

28
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:39,655
and confronted the Black Organization?

29
00:01:39,655 --> 00:01:42,855
I thought that was some kind of joke.

30
00:01:42,855 --> 00:01:47,055
Come on now. We weren't really sure

31
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:50,089
if those guys were coming on board the train or not.

32
00:01:50,089 --> 00:01:51,455
I was off my guard as well,

33
00:01:51,455 --> 00:01:54,755
until I got a text mail from Mom saying that Vermouth

34
00:01:54,755 --> 00:01:56,355
was on board the train too.

35
00:01:56,355 --> 00:01:59,155
It also seemed that our room was tapped,

36
00:01:59,155 --> 00:02:02,755
so I couldn't really say anything.

37
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:05,855
It seems that Subaru who hacked your cell phone,

38
00:02:05,855 --> 00:02:07,855
saw the mail from Vermouth.

39
00:02:07,855 --> 00:02:11,555
He thought it might be too dangerous, so he went to get you.

40
00:02:11,555 --> 00:02:12,755
Hacking?

41
00:02:12,755 --> 00:02:15,355
Just as expected, it was lucky

42
00:02:15,355 --> 00:02:18,117
that you ran into Room B of carriage number 7.

43
00:02:18,117 --> 00:02:20,855
Who is that guy named Subaru, anyway?

44
00:02:20,855 --> 00:02:25,555
Why is he living together with your mother at your place?

45
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:30,129
It's okay. He's on our side.

46
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:34,155
Besides, Mom only comes around on weekends every so often.

47
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:39,055
Well, the best result we achieved this time was finding out

48
00:02:39,055 --> 00:02:42,141
that Amuro who did part-time work at the Poirot coffee shop

49
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:45,555
is Bourbon, one of their comrades.

50
00:02:45,555 --> 00:02:49,555
Come to think of it, it seems he hasn't been to work

51
00:02:49,555 --> 00:02:51,755
because he's not in good health.

52
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:52,855
Yeah.

53
00:02:52,855 --> 00:02:55,955
It's a mystery as to why he did part-time work at Poirot,

54
00:02:55,955 --> 00:02:58,555
but I don't think he'll be back anymore.

55
00:02:58,555 --> 00:03:03,655
Fortunately, it seems that he thinks you died in that explosion.

56
00:03:05,055 --> 00:03:06,755
I was thinking that if he dared to come back,

57
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:10,169
then I would check him out this time.

58
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:11,955
At any rate,

59
00:03:11,955 --> 00:03:14,173
if you ever do something like this without telling me again,

60
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:15,655
you won't get away with it!

61
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:17,655
I feel so deceived,

62
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:22,181
and I'm not happy or anything, you know!

63
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:24,455
Can I take that as

64
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:26,185
your way of saying "thank you"?

65
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:28,187
How stupid!

66
00:03:31,255 --> 00:03:35,555
Hey. Ai is sort of a sweet-and-sour type.

67
00:03:35,555 --> 00:03:37,955
Which part of her is sweet?

68
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:41,355
Aim for a 100% solution.

69
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,855
Clear all mysteries and codes.

70
00:03:43,855 --> 00:03:45,855
When I came to, I was in a locked room.

71
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:47,555
What on earth happened?

72
00:03:47,555 --> 00:03:49,155
He sees through the one and only truth.

73
00:03:49,155 --> 00:03:51,155
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

74
00:03:51,155 --> 00:03:53,555
His name is Detective Conan!

75
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,690
"Conan in a Locked Room"

76
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,323
Well. Thank you so much!

77
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:47,690
You invited us over to your villa in Izu Highland to compensate

78
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:53,090
for putting us through all the hassle on the Bell Tree Express.

79
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,190
Moreover, it's located near a tennis court,

80
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,790
so we can play all we like.

81
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,337
Furthermore...

82
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:05,890
I heard there are loads of young and healthy female tennis players, too!

83
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,347
It's just too much.

84
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,790
Well, it rained the last time we came.

85
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:15,790
You didn't have to compensate for anything though.

86
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,890
I figured I'd bring you along while I was at it,

87
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,890
but I'm actually going for a special tennis training!

88
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,190
A special training?

89
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,790
Is there a tournament coming up?

90
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:31,690
An event bigger than a tournament happened to come up.

91
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,790
At any rate, take a look at this.

92
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,090
How are you doing, Sonoko?

93
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,890
-It's Mr. Kyogoku! -I've recently

94
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:42,690
started incorporating tennis into my karate training.

95
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,383
I would like to have a match with you

96
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:46,385
the next time I return to Japan.

97
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,890
That's why I've decided to send you a video mail.

98
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,190
What's this? It's an invitation to a tennis date!

99
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,890
Yes, it is.

100
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,590
We're going to be lovey-dovey on the tennis court!

101
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,490
Just the two of us!

102
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:01,190
But if so, you don't have to train, do you?

103
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,190
Don't be silly. I'm a member of the tennis club.

104
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,890
I can't afford to lose easily to an amateur!

105
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,490
If so, why not ask one of your tennis club seniors to help you?

106
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,390
Those weaklings are of no use.

107
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,990
But neither Dad nor I is good enough to teach you, Sonoko.

108
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,890
Don't worry about that!

109
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,890
Right, Pops Kogoro?

110
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:28,427
Yeah! I got you a special and talented coach!

111
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:31,090
A special coach?

112
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,449
Why...

113
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:52,451
Wow, Amuro!

114
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,453
He's just like Nadal.

115
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:57,290
Well, I've been hearing that since I was in intermediate school.

116
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,090
How embarrassing.

117
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,790
Why is he here?

118
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,790
I was surprised when the manager of Poirot told me

119
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,490
that you have won the Junior Tournament.

120
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,790
Well. Right after that, I hurt my shoulder,

121
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,090
so I can't serve as many times as before.

122
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,390
But it won't hurt to teach someone.

123
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,490
I'm counting on you!

124
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,790
Are you sure it'll be okay?

125
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,090
I heard that you weren't in good health.

126
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,990
I just caught a slight summer cold.

127
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,190
I'm going back to do part-time work at Poirot starting next week.

128
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,790
What?

129
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,790
Anyway, there are so many spectators here.

130
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,490
I think they mistakenly thought

131
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,090
that a pro tennis player or something have come.

132
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,290
Let's start with serve training, then.

133
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,790
-Okay. -Back down. The ball may be dangerous.

134
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,390
No, what's dangerous is not the ball...

135
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,190
-Look out! -Huh?

136
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,690
Conan!

137
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,490
No, Ran. Stay away from him!

138
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,190
He's a member of...

139
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,890
the Black Organization.

140
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,390
Well, he seems to be conscious.

141
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,190
It's just a light concussion.

142
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,190
But if his hands or legs go numb

143
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,990
or if he feels nauseated,

144
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,539
take him to the hospital and have him checked.

145
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:21,690
Yes.

146
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,543
-Goodbye, then. -Thank you very much.

147
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,490
I'm glad that it wasn't anything serious.

148
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,590
Where is this?

149
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,551
It's not Sonoko's villa, is it?

150
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:34,990
It's the villa of the one who hit you by her racket.

151
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,555
"Kotone Momozono (21), University Student" -This is my villa.

152
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:38,090
I'm so sorry, little boy.

153
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,090
My racket slipped from my hand because of perspiration.

154
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,890
That's why I told you

155
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,990
"Machi Umejima (22)" -to wrap a grip tape firmly around the handle.

156
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,565
"University Student" -You sweat a lot.

157
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:49,090
How disappointing.

158
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:52,290
If the battery of my cell phone wasn't dead,

159
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,890
I would've taken a footage of that shocking moment

160
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,890
and uploaded it on the web.

161
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,890
"Saburo Ishiguri (21), University Student" -The title would be,

162
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,581
"A Killer Racket Attacks A Young Boy: A Failed Killer Serve"!

163
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:04,590
A child has gotten hurt, you know!

164
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,090
What do you think you're saying?

165
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,590
It's only a joke.

166
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,290
I just wanted to soften up this heavy atmosphere.

167
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,090
"Noboru Takanashi (22)" -Uryu could've died

168
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,593
"University Student" -because of that joke, you know?

169
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:15,890
Don't get angry.

170
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,390
We're gathering here after a long time

171
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:22,290
to celebrate Uryu's birthday, aren't we?

172
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,890
That's right. Let's not fight.

173
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,990
Uryu will be sad to know this.

174
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,890
-Yeah. -Yeah.

175
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,613
Since the boy is safe now,

176
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,290
everyone, would you like to have a group match with us?

177
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,890
Since we have exactly four men and women here,

178
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,490
how about a mixed doubles?

179
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,690
I don't mind.

180
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,627
Well, a match is also training, you see.

181
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:50,190
I don't mind playing,

182
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,390
but can we take a break before we start?

183
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:56,635
True. I'm all sweaty from the morning match, too.

184
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:59,190
I'm hungry, too.

185
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,990
Come to think of it, I'm hungry, too!

186
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,190
I'm hungry as well.

187
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,990
We're having cold Chinese noodles for lunch.

188
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,390
Would you all like some?

189
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,290
Yes! We'll have some!

190
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,651
-But is it okay? -Yes!

191
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,090
It's a token of my apology for hurting him.

192
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,790
Then, I guess I don't want any after all.

193
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:21,190
I'm going to eat the left-over ice cake from last night in my room.

194
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,190
I tell you.

195
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,190
You'll become even fatter

196
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,590
if you keep eating things like that!

197
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,590
Don't worry, don't worry!

198
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:32,671
Okay. We'll go and help prepare lunch,

199
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:35,990
so wait for us here, Conan.

200
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,690
Ran.

201
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,390
The person who carried me in here...

202
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,590
Was it...

203
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,290
It was Amuro.

204
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,990
He treated you precisely until the doctor came.

205
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,687
He was so reliable.

206
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:54,690
Conan?

207
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,990
Where are you?

208
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,090
Conan?

209
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,490
That brat said that

210
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,990
he was going to Mr. Ishiguri's room.

211
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,790
Then, the two of them went upstairs together.

212
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,190
It seems that

213
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,690
the air conditioner of this living room isn't working well.

214
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,190
Come to think of it, it really isn't too cool here.

215
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,490
Conan.

216
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,490
Your lunch is ready.

217
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,290
Conan?

218
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,990
It seems he's asleep, so why not let him be?

219
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,390
Missing lunch won't kill him either.

220
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,790
That's true.

221
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,190
It seems that the air conditioner of this room is working, too.

222
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,735
Are you joking?

223
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,090
You mean Ishiguri still hasn't come out of his room?

224
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,690
It's already past 3.00 pm, you know?

225
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,290
We don't have all day.

226
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,690
I knocked on the door many times.

227
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,747
But it seems he locked the door and fell asleep.

228
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,290
What was that sound just now?

229
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,190
It sounded like it came from Ishiguri's room.

230
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,757
I wonder if something happened?

231
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:08,767
What was that sound?

232
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:10,769
It sounded like something fell.

233
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,090
Anyway, it's really hot in this room.

234
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,190
I wish he'd keep the air conditioner on

235
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,590
because I'm sleeping here.

236
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:20,090
What...

237
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,790
Hey, Kotone. You have the spare key, don't you?

238
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,890
The thing is, the spare key to Ishiguri's room

239
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:33,290
has been missing since last night.

240
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,590
We've got no choice.

241
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,795
It may be a bit dangerous, but I can try

242
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:39,090
entering Ishiguri's room from the veranda.

243
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,590
If the window's open, I can get inside.

244
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,803
Even if it's not, I can check out the inside of the room.

245
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,590
True. We've done that before, too.

246
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,790
But there is quite a large gap,

247
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,811
so it's impossible for me to do.

248
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:56,815
It's because you don't like high places, Machi.

249
00:13:56,815 --> 00:14:00,190
If you don't mind, would you like me to unlock the door for you?

250
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:04,823
I'm pretty good at things like that.

251
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,590
It seems to have opened.

252
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,490
You're fantastic, Amuro!

253
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:22,190
You're just like Thief Kid!

254
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,843
I have a friend who works at a security company,

255
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,990
and he secretly taught me how to do this.

256
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,190
It's a great skill to have

257
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,851
for a detective who has to search for things.

258
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:40,390
Something is blocking the door from opening.

259
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,690
Conan?

260
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,390
Don't open it!

261
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,990
Don't open the door.

262
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,090
Because the thing that's blocking the door

263
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,790
is Mr. Ishiguri's corpse.

264
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,190
What?

265
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:01,190
Moreover, this is...

266
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,390
an impossible crime.

267
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:08,490
Don't tell me it's another locked room murder?

268
00:15:15,134 --> 00:15:18,434
What? A locked room murder?

269
00:15:18,434 --> 00:15:21,234
-Do you mean this is... -Yeah.

270
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:23,534
The door which is the only entrance to this room

271
00:15:23,534 --> 00:15:26,634
is blocked by Mr. Ishiguri's corpse.

272
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:30,234
Also, all the windows were locked from the inside.

273
00:15:30,234 --> 00:15:32,911
Conan, I know you love mysteries

274
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:35,734
because you're influenced by Mr. Mouri,

275
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:40,334
but on this racket under the hips of the corpse wearing a tennis wear,

276
00:15:40,334 --> 00:15:43,634
there are marks that look like scratch bumps.

277
00:15:43,634 --> 00:15:45,834
And on the shelf near the head of the corpse,

278
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:47,834
there are similar scratches, too.

279
00:15:47,834 --> 00:15:50,034
And if the copper flower vase

280
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:54,734
that is on the shoulder of the corpse was on that shelf...

281
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:56,134
Mr. Ishiguri could be practicing swinging his racket in the room

282
00:15:56,134 --> 00:15:58,634
and his hand slipped...

283
00:15:59,734 --> 00:16:02,941
and the racket that came flying hit the shelf.

284
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:06,734
When he bent over to pick up the racket that fell...

285
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:12,951
After that, he struggled and lay on his back,

286
00:16:13,134 --> 00:16:14,534
then died in front of the door.

287
00:16:14,534 --> 00:16:16,434
Maybe it's best to think of it this way.

288
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,034
But if that's the case,

289
00:16:18,034 --> 00:16:22,034
the racket should've been closer to the shelf.

290
00:16:22,034 --> 00:16:24,434
And if he struggled and ended up lying on his back,

291
00:16:24,434 --> 00:16:25,734
I don't think such a heavy looking vase

292
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,967
would be on his shoulder, right?

293
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:31,734
Besides, on the floor right below the shelf,

294
00:16:31,734 --> 00:16:33,534
there seems to be a big dent

295
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,534
that was probably made when the vase fell.

296
00:16:36,534 --> 00:16:40,434
I woke up because I heard a loud bang.

297
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:42,634
If that was the sound of the vase falling,

298
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,983
then this certainly isn't an accident.

299
00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:47,834
-Why is that so? -That's because...

300
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:49,534
right after it happened,

301
00:16:49,534 --> 00:16:52,334
I tried touching the dead body and vase,

302
00:16:52,334 --> 00:16:55,934
but the blood on both was already dried out.

303
00:16:56,734 --> 00:16:58,034
That means

304
00:16:58,034 --> 00:17:01,834
Mr. Ishiguri was already dead before I heard the sound,

305
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:03,834
and the vase on the shelf that already had blood on it

306
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:06,034
fell to the floor, right?

307
00:17:06,034 --> 00:17:07,634
That... That's true.

308
00:17:07,634 --> 00:17:09,334
It seems that the loud sound

309
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:13,334
was also heard by the other people who were at the villa.

310
00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:16,234
Maybe you should confirm it with them.

311
00:17:16,234 --> 00:17:17,934
But...

312
00:17:17,934 --> 00:17:21,734
if that's true, why did this vase with blood on it fall?

313
00:17:21,734 --> 00:17:23,021
Beats me.

314
00:17:23,234 --> 00:17:26,534
Besides, how was Mr. Ishiguri's body,

315
00:17:26,534 --> 00:17:29,334
being as fat as he is, moved near the door

316
00:17:29,334 --> 00:17:31,634
without even leaving a trace on the floor?

317
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,734
I still don't know yet.

318
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:36,434
But the one who did that

319
00:17:36,434 --> 00:17:39,434
came to this villa along with Mr. Ishiguri,

320
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:42,234
and is on the other side of the door.

321
00:17:42,234 --> 00:17:46,534
There's no doubt that the culprit is among the three.

322
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:53,534
I think that's what Pops Kogoro would say!

323
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:58,134
So Mr. Mouri is here, too!

324
00:17:58,134 --> 00:17:59,634
By the way, Conan.

325
00:17:59,634 --> 00:18:02,434
Why are you in this room?

326
00:18:02,434 --> 00:18:05,063
That's because this afternoon, a racket came flying at me

327
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:06,434
at the tennis court.

328
00:18:09,234 --> 00:18:11,634
And I fainted after being hit by it.

329
00:18:11,634 --> 00:18:14,234
The person who threw the racket

330
00:18:14,234 --> 00:18:16,634
is a woman called Kotone Momozono.

331
00:18:16,634 --> 00:18:19,077
And this is her villa.

332
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:23,081
Since her place was right near the tennis court,

333
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:26,234
I was brought here. After the doctor examined me,

334
00:18:26,234 --> 00:18:30,334
I slept on the bed in this room for a while.

335
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:33,091
At first, I was lying down on the sofa in the living room,

336
00:18:33,334 --> 00:18:36,634
but the air conditioner in that room wasn't working well,

337
00:18:36,634 --> 00:18:38,834
so I moved to this room.

338
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:41,099
But it seems that the air conditioner here

339
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:43,834
isn't working well either.

340
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:45,834
I don't know why,

341
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:48,334
but when I got up, it was turned off.

342
00:18:48,334 --> 00:18:50,734
I see.

343
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:54,334
By the way, what's that thing

344
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,634
on the table over there?

345
00:18:56,634 --> 00:18:58,034
It's an ice cake.

346
00:18:58,034 --> 00:18:59,117
It was left over from last night,

347
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:02,834
and Mr. Ishiguri said he was going to eat it for lunch.

348
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:05,734
But it has already melted.

349
00:19:05,734 --> 00:19:08,834
What? A locked room murder?

350
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:11,634
The corpse was blocking the door,

351
00:19:11,634 --> 00:19:14,734
so why is it murder?

352
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:16,034
But...

353
00:19:16,034 --> 00:19:18,534
Conan who was in the room

354
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:20,934
said that he heard a loud sound,

355
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:22,934
and touched corpse and vase right away,

356
00:19:22,934 --> 00:19:25,143
but the blood on both were already dried.

357
00:19:25,334 --> 00:19:26,934
I tell you.

358
00:19:26,934 --> 00:19:30,234
You can't tell whether he heard it right after the sound was made.

359
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:35,153
Because this brat was still groggy from a concussion.

360
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:37,534
Besides, we don't even know

361
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:40,834
if the sound was that of the vase falling.

362
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:42,034
A culprit committing

363
00:19:42,034 --> 00:19:44,434
an intellectual crime like a locked room murder

364
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,834
wouldn't commit a crime that's so obvious.

365
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:48,834
Maybe it's because the culprit

366
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:54,134
was confronted by two big miscalculations.

367
00:19:54,134 --> 00:19:56,534
The first one is that Conan

368
00:19:56,534 --> 00:20:00,034
was wrapped up in a blanket and was sleeping in the room.

369
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:06,034
The other one was that I ended up opening

370
00:20:06,034 --> 00:20:08,834
the door of that room that was locked.

371
00:20:10,534 --> 00:20:12,434
Without these two occurrences,

372
00:20:12,434 --> 00:20:15,734
someone would've had to use the veranda

373
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:17,195
and check on Mr. Ishiguri who didn't come out of his room

374
00:20:17,434 --> 00:20:19,834
through the window.

375
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:22,434
By the time police arrived at the scene, cracked the window

376
00:20:22,434 --> 00:20:24,334
and came into the room,

377
00:20:24,334 --> 00:20:25,834
it wouldn't be unnatural

378
00:20:25,834 --> 00:20:29,207
if the blood was dried because of the heat.

379
00:20:30,034 --> 00:20:32,534
Besides, even if someone were to break in

380
00:20:32,534 --> 00:20:35,234
through the window right after the corpse was found,

381
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,734
they would focus on whether Mr. Ishiguri was dead or alive,

382
00:20:38,734 --> 00:20:41,219
and not on whether the blood had dried or not.

383
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:45,223
And when the police arrived, all that'd be reported

384
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:47,834
was that he was bleeding from his head

385
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:50,134
and was lying on the floor in front of the door.

386
00:20:50,134 --> 00:20:52,834
Good work, Conan.

387
00:20:53,734 --> 00:20:57,834
By the way, who is he?

388
00:20:57,834 --> 00:21:01,534
He's my number-one disciple detective.

389
00:21:01,534 --> 00:21:04,034
Number-one disciple?

390
00:21:04,034 --> 00:21:05,243
Yeah.

391
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:08,934
He said he was impressed by my superb deductions.

392
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,634
Mr. Mouri.

393
00:21:10,634 --> 00:21:11,834
Although I just decided by myself,

394
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:15,934
I thought that I was your number one disciple.

395
00:21:15,934 --> 00:21:17,255
Is... Is that right?

396
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:21,259
At any rate, why don't we ask the three people

397
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:23,734
who were at this villa to begin with?

398
00:21:23,734 --> 00:21:26,434
They're the only ones

399
00:21:26,434 --> 00:21:28,834
who have motives for this murder.

400
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:31,034
No... No way.

401
00:21:31,034 --> 00:21:34,934
Are you saying that the culprit is among us?

402
00:21:34,934 --> 00:21:38,634
Right. It's very likely that there's no mistake about it.

403
00:21:38,634 --> 00:21:42,434
But the problem lies in that locked room.

404
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:47,634
How on earth did the culprit come out of that room?

405
00:21:47,634 --> 00:21:52,034
All the windows were locked from the inside

406
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:54,434
and Mr. Ishiguri's corpse was in front of the door

407
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:57,295
that opens inwardly.

408
00:21:57,295 --> 00:22:02,334
Even if the culprit had the spare key for the door,

409
00:22:02,334 --> 00:22:05,303
the corpse was lying in front of the door,

410
00:22:05,303 --> 00:22:08,434
so the culprit wouldn't be able to open it.

411
00:22:08,434 --> 00:22:11,734
On the other hand, it would've been impossible for the culprit

412
00:22:11,734 --> 00:22:15,734
to place Mr. Ishiguri's body in that position after leaving the room.

413
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,334
Darn it.

414
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:20,034
How on earth did the culprit do it?

415
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,500
Next Conan's Hint:

416
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,520
"PET bottle"

417
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,128
I should be careful of Amuro?

418
00:23:53,128 --> 00:23:54,380
Because he's Shinichi's rival?

419
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,413
No.
