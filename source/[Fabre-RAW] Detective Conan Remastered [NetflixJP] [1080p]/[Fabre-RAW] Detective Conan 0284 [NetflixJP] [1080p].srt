1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,670
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,370
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,970
Today, it's Chinatown in Yokohama.

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,170
The surprise figure linked to Ran.

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,770
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,670
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,870
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,910
Who presented Emperor Daigo

9
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,710
the Twelve-Article Recommendations?

10
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,710
Miyoshi no Kiyoyuki.

11
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,810
What is the name of the Jodo painting

12
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,810
depicting the descension of Buddha on earth?

13
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,910
The "Shouju-raikou-zu".

14
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,810
Hey. Get done with it.

15
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,510
I can feel my brain beginning to hemorrhage.

16
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,210
I can't help it.

17
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,910
I have a Japanese history test tomorrow.

18
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,610
I didn't have time to study

19
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,610
with all the extracurricular activities I have.

20
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,410
Then, why not do it at home?

21
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,710
Did I hear you say something?

22
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,710
You're telling me to stay home when I was the one

23
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,210
who won the meal coupon for dinner in Chinatown in the lottery?

24
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,610
That's why, I'm telling you to do it when you get back home.

25
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,010
That's not enough time.

26
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,410
There're a lot of TV programs I want to watch tonight.

27
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,910
But, reading inside a car can make you sick.

28
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,910
Worry not. I have superb sense of balance,

29
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,710
thanks to my vestibular system.

30
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,910
It's started to rain.

31
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,510
Yep. It's starting to rain pretty hard.

32
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,410
Rain.

33
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,710
Yes... he...

34
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,610
He was standing in the rain.

35
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,510
But I can't tell where it was.

36
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,910
A backstreet in a strange city.

37
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,510
But why?

38
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,110
Every time I try to recall that man...

39
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,010
His image comes back in my mind.

40
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:42,410
Yes. Standing in the rain just like this.

41
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,410
That lonely but gentle face.

42
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,510
Shinichi's face.

43
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,910
Why are you wet?

44
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,110
Why that lonely look?

45
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,710
Tell me, Shinichi.

46
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,510
Ran...

47
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,010
What happened, Ran?

48
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,010
You looked scary with wrinkles between your brows.

49
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,910
Oh. I couldn't remember the answer to a question in this book.

50
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,310
Well...

51
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,110
Insei rule, Fujiwara no Kiyohara...

52
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,810
Oh, no. I think I'm getting carsick.

53
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:33,110
"Chinatown Dejavu In The Rain (Part 1)"

54
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,610
What are we to do?

55
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,610
The shoot is about to begin,

56
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,210
and the female lead suffers bone fracture in a motorbike accident.

57
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,510
Well, it probably means this movie project must be scrapped.

58
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,010
It seems to me that it's cursed.

59
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,010
Hey, hey.

60
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,510
Are you going to throw away this moneymaker?

61
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,010
We're attracting attention for this sequel to a hit movie.

62
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,310
But, Mr. Kawabata.

63
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,610
The girl we finally managed to find to play the role got hurt.

64
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,810
"Motohiro Ito (38)" -There's no one else.

65
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,310
"Assistant director" -This is an omen.

66
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,210
You might be right. If we continue,

67
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,010
"Keigo Kitaura (29)" -we might end up the same

68
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,910
"Writer" -with a major accident.

69
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,710
Anyway, as the author of the book,

70
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,310
that girl wasn't exactly my image of the character.

71
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,010
It turned out lucky for me.

72
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,710
Mr. Kitaura.

73
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,410
Shoot. I wonder where I can find

74
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,110
a girl who's young and pretty and can handle stunts.

75
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,910
What do you mean?

76
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,910
We can't use the coupon?

77
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,410
So, I'm telling you...

78
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,910
Look here. The name of your restaurant.

79
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,410
Yes, that's us.

80
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,710
We issued the coupon.

81
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:55,710
But...

82
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,610
Then, why can't we use it?

83
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,110
I demand an explanation and a clear one.

84
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,910
-So, that's why... -Hey, kiddo.

85
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,110
What's your sister's name?

86
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,510
Who in the world are you?

87
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:17,410
Who am I?

88
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,610
I'll tell you, kiddo. My name is...

89
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,510
What kind of joint is this?

90
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,110
Don't tell me you pick your customers?

91
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,910
No. Of course not.

92
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,110
If you want to pick up a fight...

93
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,910
Excuse me, mister.

94
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,610
Let's talk outside.

95
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,810
You're not forcing us out of here.

96
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,910
We're not moving unless you give us a good reason.

97
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,310
Your sister's got brawn, too.

98
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:55,710
We're trying to tell you that it is written in the coupon

99
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,910
that it cannot be used on Sundays and holidays.

100
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,110
What?

101
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,010
Oh, yes. It's written in the fine print.

102
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,310
What?

103
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,010
"This coupon is not applicable during Sundays and holidays"

104
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,810
Oh...

105
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,110
Oh, no. I sincerely apologize.

106
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,110
I'm so sorry.

107
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,510
Oh, no, we're happy that you understand the provisions.

108
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,710
Geez, why didn't you check in the first place?

109
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,610
What about you? You're the one who rushed out first,

110
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,110
saying that early bird catches the worm?

111
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,610
Who says?

112
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,610
Well, young lady, that was a good kick.

113
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,610
How about you and me going to see a Bruce Lee movie?

114
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,810
Who's talking?

115
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,110
Me?

116
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,810
Hello.

117
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,610
Mike Hama?

118
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,510
I've heard that before.

119
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,410
So, that's Mike Hama.

120
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:55,610
I've got an office on the 2nd floor of Yokohama Nichigeki in Kogane-cho.

121
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,910
Yes, I remember.

122
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,510
That second-rate private eye who has an office

123
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,110
on the second floor of a movie theater.

124
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,210
Well, that's that.

125
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,510
Well, lady,

126
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:14,110
call me when you feel like going out with me.

127
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,610
See you later, kiddo.

128
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,410
What was that?

129
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,910
Don't know.

130
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,410
Sir.

131
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:28,210
Your dinner, sir. What would you like to do?

132
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,610
Well... actually...

133
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,010
Excuse me.

134
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,210
If you don't mind, how about dinner with us?

135
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,010
Of course, it's on us.

136
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,310
Thanks, but...

137
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,910
"Restaurant Conan Doyle"

138
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,910
What? A leading role in a movie?

139
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,910
You're exactly what we want.

140
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,710
Of course, if you're interested.

141
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,810
-Well... -Don't even think about it.

142
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,110
You'll only embarrass yourself, blowing your lines.

143
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:07,710
Unless you have the skills of elocution and persuasion I have.

144
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,110
The skills are not yours but mine.

145
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,410
Well...

146
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,110
But, young lady,

147
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,610
if you become popular with the movie,

148
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,110
you're going to join the stars.

149
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,910
You'll get to be friends with a lot of show biz celebrities.

150
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,510
-What? -Not only the celebrities.

151
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:27,310
There will be pro baseball players, pro soccer players, race drivers.

152
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,910
There may be shoots in America or Britain or France.

153
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,010
You can get to foreign countries around the world.

154
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,310
Why don't you try it?

155
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,910
Go for it. Take on challenges.

156
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,010
Really?

157
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,210
But you should be resolved to take anything

158
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,910
if you intend to take the plunge.

159
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,310
Yeah, considering a movie producer

160
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,910
who likes add a kissing scene

161
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,310
that is irrelevant to the plot of the book.

162
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,310
Kissing?

163
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:00,610
Mr. Kitaura, you don't mean me...

164
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,810
I changed my mind. Don't.

165
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,510
Don't. I didn't know that.

166
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,610
Me neither.

167
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,910
Forget it if you're intimidated by kissing.

168
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:16,610
You might even die during the shoot if you're unlucky.

169
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,210
Hey. Stop scaring her.

170
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,010
She's a gold mine.

171
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,910
I am not.

172
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,210
-Ouch. -I'm sorry.

173
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,610
Are you all right?

174
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,010
Never mind.

175
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,310
I'll wipe it off with this towel.

176
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:37,410
Waiter, can you get me a new pair of chopsticks?

177
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,210
Yes, sir. Coming up.

178
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,210
Huh?

179
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,910
You definitely have a fever. Are you okay?

180
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,210
I'm okay. Just a nose cold.

181
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,810
But, if you should faint like before...

182
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,910
-Before? -Nothing.

183
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,410
Come and sit here away from your pig-headed father.

184
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,910
Let's talk.

185
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,510
Tell me what you want.

186
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,510
I'll serve some up on a plate for you.

187
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,910
Oh, thanks.

188
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,210
Here you are.

189
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,010
Thanks.

190
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,510
Hey! I said no "pitans" and egg dishes!

191
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,510
What's wrong?

192
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,210
I'm allergic to eggs.

193
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,010
I hate even the sight of them.

194
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:36,010
Anyway, young lady, eat all you want.

195
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,810
Thank you. Well...

196
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,910
I want curry with rice.

197
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:45,110
Hey, kid, this is a Chinese restaurant.

198
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,110
They don't serve curry here.

199
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,210
What? I want curry.

200
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,910
Curry. Curry. Curry.

201
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,410
No curry? This place stinks.

202
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,010
Let's go home.

203
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:00,710
Please, we'd better go home, Ran.

204
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,710
You're being so pesky.

205
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,610
Okay.

206
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,910
How about this meat dumplings?

207
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,710
You liked it when you had it the last time, remember?

208
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,610
Oh, yeah.

209
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,910
Boy, are you good at picking up my message?

210
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,010
Well, where's the soy sauce?

211
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,510
There. In front of the old man.

212
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,610
There.

213
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,810
Darn it, it's back in front of Kogoro.

214
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,510
I'll get it this time.

215
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,310
Again...

216
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:37,510
What is it, Conan? What do you want?

217
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,410
Well, some soy sauce.

218
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,210
-Here. -Thanks.

219
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:46,910
Next, the chili oil is in front of that fox-eyed guy.

220
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:50,110
Here it comes.

221
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,510
What? Darn.

222
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,010
Here, chili oil, right?

223
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,410
Yeah.

224
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:04,710
Now she's taking care of me.

225
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,910
Oh. Here it comes.

226
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,910
Peking Duck here is the best.

227
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,410
By the way, are there actresses who you like?

228
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,810
Yes. There are two.

229
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,810
One is Yukiko Fujimine.

230
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,810
Actually, she is the mother of a friend since kindergarten.

231
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,710
I've idolized her since I was a child.

232
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,110
Who is the other one?

233
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,910
The other is an American actress.

234
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,010
Sharon Vinyard.

235
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,510
Though she died a year ago.

236
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,810
Oh. That great actress.

237
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,310
I had the opportunity to meet her once.

238
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,310
She was wonderful.

239
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,610
When did that happen? Meeting an American celebrity.

240
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,810
When you weren't around.

241
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:49,010
Yukiko Fujimine and Sharon Vinyard

242
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,710
more substance than glitz seems to be your taste.

243
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,010
They both have gained legendary status.

244
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,210
If she still alive,

245
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:01,210
she could have been a legend, too.

246
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,110
Huh?

247
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,210
Who's she?

248
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,410
The victim is Mr. Shiro Kawabata, age 46,

249
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,610
film producer.

250
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,510
Death by asphyxiation triggered by cyanide poisoning.

251
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:38,310
Gosh, cyanide, arsenic, caustic soda.

252
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:43,410
Where do criminals these days get these toxins?

253
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:47,410
And, did he eat something before he died?

254
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,310
Yes, Peking Duck.

255
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,310
According to the waiter who served him,

256
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,610
he started to suffer right after he put it in his mouth.

257
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,010
Peking Duck for his last dinner.

258
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,310
What a way to go.

259
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,710
But, poison was not found in that piece of duck meat,

260
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,210
and the waiter did not have it in his possession.

261
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:13,710
The victim probably had cyanide on his hand

262
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:17,410
before he bit into the food.

263
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,610
I see.

264
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,610
That means that the murderer

265
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:27,910
was sitting among you here at the table?

266
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,910
Anyway, I would like to ask all of you

267
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,910
your relationship with the victim.

268
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,410
Yes, member of the movie production staff.

269
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,010
The female lead in the movie

270
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,210
got hurt before the shooting started.

271
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:42,110
That's why we were discussing it.

272
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,910
Whether we should find a replacement

273
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,310
or scrap the project altogether.

274
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,610
Then, Mr. Kawabata took on a liking for that girl

275
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:53,510
and invited her and her father to our table.

276
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,910
You, with the beard.

277
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,110
I've seen you somewhere before.

278
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:02,710
Yes, of course. I am the...

279
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,510
Probably a criminal on the run.

280
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,510
Huh?

281
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,710
No, no.

282
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,710
I'm Kogoro Mouri.

283
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,410
Mo... Mouri?

284
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,710
Don't tell me...

285
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,110
That famous detective?

286
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,410
Yes, yes.

287
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,410
Oh, that two-bit detective called Smoking Kogoro.

288
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,810
Sleeping. Not Smoking.

289
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,510
Inspector. I found positive toxic reaction.

290
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,110
All right.

291
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,310
We didn't find it in the other dishes.

292
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,810
Cyanide has been found

293
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:37,010
on the chopsticks, plate and towel the victim used.

294
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,210
It was strongest on the towel.

295
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,610
Who sat beside him when he fell?

296
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,910
Me. I sat on his right.

297
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,610
Then, who was at his left?

298
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,710
Me.

299
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:57,010
I sat on his left eating my dumpling.

300
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,410
That makes things easy.

301
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,010
The person who poisoned the victim

302
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,710
by lacing his towel with cyanide is...

303
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,710
You, Mr. Detective.

304
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,010
What? Me?

305
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,010
A kid like him won't be able to commit murder,

306
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,610
and with you sitting on his right,

307
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,210
switching must have been easy.

308
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,710
If the victim was right-handed,

309
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,710
he most probably had his towel on his right.

310
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,810
You expected him to wipe his hands

311
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,710
before he ate his Peking Duck, right?

312
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,710
How's that?

313
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,710
I think I've seen you somewhere before.

314
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,410
Don't try to distract attention.

315
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,710
I have the same feeling.

316
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,810
You do, too?

317
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,810
I've only seen your face on TV and newspapers.

318
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,110
Inspector Yokomizo. Sir.

319
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,510
What is it?

320
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,510
Yokomizo?

321
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:53,110
Yes! You're Yokomizo! Yokomizo!

322
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,110
I suspect that you committed a blunder

323
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,710
and had to shave your head.

324
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,710
That's why you're so embarrassed

325
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,310
and are pretending not to know us.

326
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,710
Hey. Hey. You, the great pretender.

327
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,810
Well, to tell you the truth, that hair you had was quite unkempt.

328
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,610
You look much cleaner.

329
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:15,110
You are talking about my brother Sango with the Shizuoka Police.

330
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,610
I am Jugo Yokomizo of the Kanagawa Police.

331
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,710
A brother?

332
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:21,910
For real?

333
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:25,010
It appears that the naive and trusting brother of mine respected you,

334
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,910
but I'm different.

335
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:31,210
I don't have an inkling of respect for shady people like detectives.

336
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,810
Sir. Inspector.

337
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,310
Oh, kept you waiting.

338
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:37,310
Look what I found on the jeans the victim was wearing.

339
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,410
Some sort of the stain.

340
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,310
Beats me.

341
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:44,210
Oh, that's Mr. Kawabata's soup.

342
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,710
I spilled it when I sat next to him.

343
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,410
What? Next to him?

344
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,810
I thought that you and the kid were sitting next to him!

345
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:55,310
Mr. Kawabata changed seats just before he fainted.

346
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,010
He took a seat between Ran and me.

347
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:02,810
Later, Conan sat next to him.

348
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,210
Then, before he changed seats,

349
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,910
he was sitting next to the girl...

350
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,810
And me.

351
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:13,310
But, I just happened to sit there because Mr. Kawabata

352
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:16,210
invited that detective and others to our table.

353
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,110
Incidentally, before Mr. Mouri arrived,

354
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,310
we sat beside Mr. Kawabata.

355
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:27,210
But then, we were seated quite apart from each other.

356
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:32,310
I was seated right at opposite of him, so I'm innocent.

357
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,510
We will know after we investigate.

358
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,410
Then, why not check his jeans?

359
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:42,010
Mr. Kawabata changed his seat after he got the soup on his lap.

360
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,210
He wasn't trying to wipe it off with the towel.

361
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:47,810
If you check the stain, you'll probably know

362
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:50,710
when the towel was tampered with, right?

363
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,210
Isn't that right, Uncle Kogoro?

364
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,210
Well, yeah.

365
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:59,410
What? There was no cyanide in the stain?

366
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,010
Did you check it thoroughly?

367
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:04,210
Yeah. The waiter said he replaced the chopsticks

368
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:07,310
that fell on the floor with the soup on the victim's order,

369
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:11,310
there was no cyanide on the chopsticks either.

370
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,710
That means,

371
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,110
the culprit replaced that towel with a poisoned one

372
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,410
after all these event,

373
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:24,010
which means the suspect is you, who sat on his right.

374
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,510
Nonsense.

375
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,510
Why would I have to kill Mr. Kawabata, when I have seen him

376
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:33,810
for the first time at a restaurant I came for the first time?

377
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,310
There's no telling.

378
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,810
Well, the story about your daughter been asked to

379
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,910
appear in the movie at a restaurant you came for the first time

380
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,510
sounds suspicious, too.

381
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,710
Hey, that's...

382
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,010
That's true.

383
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,610
We came here just by coincidence...

384
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,110
Huh?

385
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,610
Rain.

386
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,910
A rainy day again.

387
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:16,310
I saw him.

388
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,510
Who is he?

389
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:23,710
Or, is it somebody else who looks like the Inspector?

390
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,010
I can't remember.

391
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,510
That faint image of three faces.

392
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,210
A mouth smiling.

393
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,410
Angry eyes.

394
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,610
And...

395
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,660
What?

396
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,460
What are you saying?

397
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,060
I can't hear, Shinichi.

398
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:54,260
Ran.

399
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,660
What happened?

400
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,660
You look pale.

401
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:02,060
Oh, I'm okay. I just felt faint.

402
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,660
Why don't you sit down here?

403
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:08,460
I think Uncle will solve the case soon.

404
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,060
Yeah, thanks.

405
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,860
And, don't get in the way, Conan.

406
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,960
Yep.

407
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,360
We're in trouble.

408
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,360
Ran must be really sick.

409
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,060
We have to get her to the hospital soon.

410
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,340
Next Conan's Hint:

411
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,340
"Wet towel"

412
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,000
The private eye Mike Hama?

413
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,540
Frivolous old man Kogoro will be put to test.
