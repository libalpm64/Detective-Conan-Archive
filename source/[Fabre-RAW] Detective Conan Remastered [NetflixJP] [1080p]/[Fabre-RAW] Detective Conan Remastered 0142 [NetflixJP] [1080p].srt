1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,380
Alibis, secret codes, tricks, deals.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,380
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,980
The case takes place the night before the wedding,

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,780
the one you love is very close.

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,480
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,380
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,880
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:57,490
Heiji and Kazuha come to Tokyo to attend an acquaintance's wedding.

9
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,690
While we are giving them a tour of the city,

10
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,290
we run into Shigematsu, the butler for the Morizono family

11
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,590
whose son is getting married.

12
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,290
Invited for a dinner by Shigematsu, we go to the estate.

13
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,790
But later that night,

14
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:13,790
he is murdered in a locked room.

15
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:19,390
Kazuha then discovers a connection between two of the suspects.

16
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:27,990
"Murder Behind Locked Doors on the Night Before the Wedding (Part 2)"

17
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,990
What? You can't find the weapon?

18
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,590
Yes, we're searching inside and outside the residence

19
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,590
but nothing's turned up be.

20
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,190
That's impossible.

21
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,390
It has to be somewhere around here.

22
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:45,990
The weapon used to stab the butler, Shigematsu has to be around here.

23
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,690
Not only the weapon,

24
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,190
you might find the bloody clothes the killer wore.

25
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,290
Look at Shigematsu's wound,

26
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,790
he lost a lot of blood.

27
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,190
I'm pretty sure a lot of blood got onto the killer

28
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,190
when he pulled the knife out.

29
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,590
You're right.

30
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,190
But Inspector,

31
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,090
if the killer was a burglar who just happened to sneak in,

32
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,190
it's possible he's already faraway and the weapon's with him.

33
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,890
No, that's not possible.

34
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:14,990
It isn't?

35
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,290
Security around this estate is tight.

36
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,890
The only outsiders entering the grounds

37
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:24,590
were we police and the mass media after the body was found.

38
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:30,590
Besides, the door and every window was found locked.

39
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,390
A burglar who just happened to break in

40
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,390
wouldn't be able to pull off a stunt like that.

41
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,090
Which means the killer

42
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,290
is someone who doesn't have an alibi

43
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:43,390
and is very familiar with this place, namely, one of those five.

44
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,890
So how'd it go?

45
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,090
You questioned them didn't you, Inspector?

46
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,390
Yes.

47
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,990
The head of the household,

48
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,190
Mikio was in his room waiting for Shigematsu

49
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,890
who was supposed to meet him there.

50
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,190
His daughter, Yurie was alone and taking a bath.

51
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,790
His son, Kikuhito was in his room

52
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,290
listening to music and reading a magazine.

53
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,190
Sakuraba, the hired help was searching the place

54
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,190
looking for the cat.

55
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,690
Kaede claims she was taking a nap

56
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,590
while waiting for someone from her home to come for her,

57
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,290
she's the most suspicious.

58
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,290
Why is that?

59
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,990
Yurie said she went to her room

60
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,590
to ask her to join her in the bath

61
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,890
but there was no answer.

62
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,690
What happened?

63
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,990
There so much broken glass.

64
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,290
Truth is after we found the body,

65
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,390
Sakuraba was angered by Kikuhito's insensitive remarks

66
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,190
and he attacked Kikuhito.

67
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,690
The force sent Kikuhito flying into the window.

68
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,090
Inspector Megure, please come here.

69
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,190
What is it, Tome?

70
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,790
Take a look at this.

71
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,490
Did you find something?

72
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,890
There's a little blood behind this latch.

73
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,190
You're right.

74
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,790
It looks like someone with a bloody glove grabbed it.

75
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:08,090
Which means the killer opened then closed this window.

76
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,890
But what'd the killer do?

77
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,990
The window was locked from the inside.

78
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,990
Hey, Hattori.

79
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,290
Here, look at this piece of glass.

80
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,590
There's a small hole in it.

81
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,490
Hey? I wonder how.

82
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,590
That hole wasn't there before it broke.

83
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,990
I don't blame you for missing it.

84
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,090
By looking at the shape of this piece,

85
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,090
it seems the hole was made at the very edge of the frame.

86
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,190
Which means there should be more.

87
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,190
Yes, "it" should be somewhere on the veranda.

88
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,190
Inspector, may I have a word with you?

89
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,990
Yes, what is it?

90
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,790
How much longer are you going to leave Shigematsu like this?

91
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,890
Before he became our butler,

92
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,590
he was a close friend to both my wife and me.

93
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,790
If it's possible, I'd like to take the body

94
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:00,390
and have funeral services performed,

95
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:03,790
he'll be buried close to my wife. She would like that.

96
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,290
I'm sorry,

97
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,190
we can't release the body until the autopsy's over.

98
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,890
I see. That's too bad.

99
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:16,090
So that story mom told me was true.

100
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,290
What story?

101
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,790
Mom told me that Mrs. Morizono, who died 4 years ago

102
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,990
was really in love with Shigematsu.

103
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,590
She used to come to this estate to see Shigematsu

104
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,490
but Morizono misunderstood and thought she was in love with him

105
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,590
so he proposed to her.

106
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,390
Both of their parents were in favor of the marriage

107
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,890
and she didn't know what to do

108
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,390
but Morizono's feelings for her won her over

109
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,190
and they got married.

110
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,190
That's that she told my mom.

111
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,490
The wife and the butler.

112
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,190
It sounds pretty fishy.

113
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,990
That's right, sounds familiar doesn't it?

114
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,290
Like those two with the matching pendants.

115
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,790
By the way Hattori,

116
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,690
did you find what we were talking about?

117
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,490
I couldn't find it anywhere.

118
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,890
If the killer escaped through this veranda,

119
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,490
there's bound to be some.

120
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,390
I think we should try it out on the veranda in the next room.

121
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,390
Try what out?

122
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,190
You know what I mean.

123
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,390
We're going to see if you can really get down from the veranda.

124
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,690
Who's going to do it?

125
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,690
You're the only one who can do it, Heiji.

126
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,690
Kudo, make real sure the rope won't get loose.

127
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,490
You don't have to remind me.

128
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,490
Who would do this?

129
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,190
Hey, how'd it go Hattori?

130
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,190
It was easier than I thought.

131
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:46,490
Which means, the killer must've gotten down by the veranda.

132
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,390
What's that?

133
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,090
Something's caught in the tree.

134
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,190
Where?

135
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,690
There, in the tree right in front of the room the body's in...

136
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,990
What're you doing?

137
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,690
Kudo! Hang on, I'll be right there!

138
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,390
Oh dear. Ran! Isn't that Conan?

139
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,690
I don't believe it.

140
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,290
-Hey, kid. -You there!

141
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,390
Don't just stand there!

142
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,590
Do something quick and save him!

143
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,190
Save him? I... I'm...

144
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,590
That was close.

145
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,090
What's going on here?

146
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,890
This kid was about to fall.

147
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:42,890
Oh my!

148
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,790
You! Why didn't you help him?

149
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,390
You were right there!

150
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,790
Wait! He couldn't help it.

151
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:57,690
Kikuhito's been terribly afraid of heights since he was a child.

152
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,590
That's right, Shigematsu mentioned something like that.

153
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,290
By the way, Hattori, about that thing...

154
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,390
Oh yeah, let's go check it out.

155
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,490
Now what're you two up to?

156
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,990
Why are you climbing this tree?

157
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,190
Be careful.

158
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,290
I see it. There.

159
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,390
Is it a bloody shirt?

160
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,390
There's bloody gloves and...

161
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,690
A knife.

162
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,090
Just as I thought, there's tape on it.

163
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:34,590
I figured out who the killer is and how the locked room trick was done.

164
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,690
-The case is hereby closed. -The case is hereby closed.

165
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,690
Something doesn't feel right.

166
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:46,090
Yeah. And we've still got a lot of keywords dangling in the air.

167
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,390
It's starting to rain.

168
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,990
It's starting to rain harder.

169
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,390
Hey, it's starting to rain.

170
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,990
It is?

171
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,390
Hey, wait a minute. I'm pretty sure...

172
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,690
The rain shutters.

173
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,190
Yes, I see.

174
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,890
If that's how it happened,

175
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,290
then the weapon not found on the scene,

176
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,390
the bloodstains from dragging the body,

177
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,190
the light out in the next room,

178
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,590
the cat in the room with the body,

179
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:18,390
and the evidence packaged neatly like this...

180
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,690
Everything fits perfectly!

181
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,890
I'm positive he's the killer.

182
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,790
But what can we do?

183
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,290
We don't have any proof.

184
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,590
Then we'll just get the killer to...

185
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,090
Confess!

186
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:40,090
Kazuha. Tell everyone to meet us in the room the murder took place.

187
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,290
What for?

188
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,990
Ran, ask the Inspector to come here.

189
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,790
Tell him Heiji has something very interesting to tell him.

190
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,890
Right?

191
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:50,990
Right.

192
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,690
What's going on?

193
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,090
Why does he want us all here?

194
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,490
Sorry to keep you waiting.

195
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,490
Hey, why'd you call us all here?

196
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,390
Don't tell me you're going to put on a mystery show.

197
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,490
That's right, I am...

198
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,590
-What? -What?

199
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,490
I figured out who the killer is

200
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,890
and how the locked room trick was done.

201
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:17,090
The person responsible for stabbing Shigematsu

202
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,590
and escaping while locking the room is...

203
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,890
you!

204
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,390
Sakuraba!

205
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,590
You're kidding.

206
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,390
I don't believe Sakuraba is the murderer.

207
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,590
It can't be.

208
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,390
I don't believe it.

209
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,990
You have an explanation, don't you?

210
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,690
How the murder behind locked doors was committed...

211
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,890
There, I did it.

212
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:43,890
The key to the trick was this tiny hole in the glass.

213
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,390
A hole?

214
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,990
The crime lab technicians have already checked it.

215
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,690
And this.

216
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:54,990
The end has been tied into a loop and then taped.

217
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,490
First you take the string to the latch, and put looped end over it.

218
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,690
Next, put looped end over it, then pass the other end,

219
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,590
through the hole in the glass,

220
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,090
and then you go out on the veranda,

221
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,690
close the window without locking it.

222
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,590
All you have to do now is pull the string carefully...

223
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,690
It locked.

224
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,690
Then you give one hard tug

225
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,690
and the string will pull out of the tape.

226
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,890
All that's left is to pull the string from the outside,

227
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,790
and you have your murder in a locked room.

228
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:33,190
But once the police see the hole, they'll figure it out right away...

229
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,990
That's why Sakuraba punched Kikuhito.

230
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,190
He used Kikuhito to break the glass

231
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,190
so the police wouldn't find it.

232
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,490
But he hit him because what Kikuhito said was cruel.

233
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,590
That doesn't matter!

234
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:52,990
Sakuraba was waiting for an opportunity to break the glass.

235
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:57,390
Unfortunately, it didn't break in a way to hide the hole.

236
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:01,390
But that's not enough to prove he's the killer.

237
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,790
Think carefully.

238
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,790
The killer got down from that veranda.

239
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,190
Mr. Morizono has a bad leg,

240
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,890
he wouldn't be able to something so strenuous

241
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,890
and it's too difficult for Yurie and Kaede because they're women.

242
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,890
We can strike Kikuhito out since he's afraid of heights,

243
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:21,190
the only one left is Sakuraba who is agile

244
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,090
and easily climbed up the tree to get the cat...

245
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,390
Yes, you!

246
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:30,290
You stabbed Shigematsu to death in this room,

247
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:33,290
used the trick I just showed to lock the window

248
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,590
then got down from the veranda,

249
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:39,090
and rushed here with everyone else acting like nothing happened.

250
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,590
Well? Did I miss something, Sakuraba?

251
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,490
You're wrong. I didn't do it.

252
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,390
I didn't kill anyone.

253
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,990
He's right. Sakuraba couldn't be the killer.

254
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,790
Because...

255
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:58,090
until he heard the scream and rushed over,

256
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,490
he was with me.

257
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,680
Is that the truth?

258
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,480
Yes, we were looking around the house for the cat.

259
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,180
Then why didn't you tell us this before?

260
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,580
Because...

261
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,480
You didn't want anyone to know your relationship with him?

262
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,880
What relationship?

263
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,880
They're both wearing the same pendant.

264
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,280
That proves they're deeply involved with each other.

265
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,680
I see, so they're lovers.

266
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,380
Mr. Morizono suggested she marry his son

267
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,780
and Shigematsu tried to break

268
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,080
then up so they killed him, is that it?

269
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,880
No. I didn't do it.

270
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,580
You can explain everything down at the station...

271
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,680
Please wait.

272
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,180
We really were together at that time.

273
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,780
I'm very sorry

274
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,980
but we can't accept the testimony

275
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,280
of someone closely involved with the accused.

276
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,480
That's not fair.

277
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,980
Take him away!

278
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,980
Yes, sir.

279
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,180
No. It wasn't me.

280
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,580
Please believe me.

281
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,980
I honestly didn't...

282
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,280
Sakuraba.

283
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,580
Sakuraba! No...

284
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,780
Here, wipe your tears.

285
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,380
I'll wait for as long as it takes

286
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,380
for you to forget about him and accept me.

287
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,280
I can't believe Sakuraba killed Shigematsu.

288
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,680
It's unthinkable.

289
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,480
It may be difficult to believe, but it's the truth.

290
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,480
There's no denying it, he's the inhuman,

291
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,480
ruthless murderer who killed the gentle Shigematsu.

292
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,780
Heiji.

293
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,780
Oh well, if we find the murder weapon in his room,

294
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,680
the murderer will have to confess.

295
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,480
You mean you haven't found it yet?

296
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,380
We're leaving for today

297
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,280
but we'll be back tomorrow to search for the weapon.

298
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,680
Well, I guess we should be going too.

299
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,280
Hey.

300
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,380
It's late, why don't we stay here tonight?

301
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,580
Is that okay?

302
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,780
"Sakuraba"

303
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,480
So, it was you after all.

304
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,780
Kikuhito?

305
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,680
I guess you figured you'd plant the evidence

306
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,680
in Sakuraba's things to make him look guiltier,

307
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,080
but you didn't fool me.

308
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,180
You don't know what you're talking about.

309
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,080
I have acrophobia, I could never commit that crime.

310
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,280
That trick's a fake.

311
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,280
And to prove it, there's blood smudged on the latch

312
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,980
as if a gloved hand touched it

313
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,680
but there's nothing outside on the veranda.

314
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,580
A killer who is so careful enough to use gloves

315
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,880
wouldn't deliberately take them off

316
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,080
when making his escape from the veranda.

317
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,080
Then how did I work that locked room trick?

318
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,080
You didn't need a trick.

319
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,180
You were in that room from the very start!

320
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,480
What?

321
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,580
I'm pretty sure you were hiding

322
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,480
behind the left curtain in the next room.

323
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,180
Isn't that why you closed the shutter on only that side?

324
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:01,280
So no one on the outside would be able to see you.

325
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,980
You opened the hole in the glass beforehand

326
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,080
and prepared the taped string

327
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
then you asked Shigematsu to meet you there

328
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,780
and you killed him.

329
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,280
The blood splashed onto Sakuraba's shirt,

330
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,780
the one you stole sometime before.

331
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,580
You dragged the body into the next room,

332
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,180
then wrapped the murder weapon and gloves in the shirt

333
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,580
and threw it out the window.

334
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,780
You saw us through the window and...

335
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,380
So you broke the glass to make us come here

336
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,980
then hid behind the curtain.

337
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,980
When we broke the door down and entered the room,

338
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,380
the trail of blood caught our attention

339
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,980
and led us into the next room

340
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,280
where we concentrated on the body.

341
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,380
That's when you came out of hiding.

342
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,280
It was dark and on top of that, the body had all our attention

343
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,880
so no one noticed you.

344
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,680
Then you made it appear as if you'd come with the others

345
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,780
when you heard the scream.

346
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,780
You put the cat in the room

347
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,980
to make Sakuraba's alibi seem suspicious.

348
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,580
Because you knew your father would make him go look for it

349
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,080
once he knew the cat was missing.

350
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,080
But anyone could have done it.

351
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,080
No, only you could've done it.

352
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,780
And the proof's the evidence tied in a bundle.

353
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:22,180
A perpetrator usually doesn't put all the proofs of evidence in one bundle.

354
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,880
But an acrophobic like you wouldn't be able to go out on the veranda

355
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,780
so you used the knife as weight and threw the bundle out the window.

356
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,880
You made him hit you so the glass with the hole would break,

357
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,780
you planned it.

358
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,680
It would look like he did it to destroy the evidence.

359
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,680
What are you talking about?

360
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,980
I came here to help solve the case.

361
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,280
I just found this knife in his bag.

362
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,280
You fool. Take a good look.

363
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,080
That isn't his bag.

364
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,480
It's mine.

365
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,580
Besides, the real Sakuraba's room is next door.

366
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,180
Everything, this bag and this room,

367
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,980
even the evidence we left hanging in the tree

368
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,680
and Sakuraba's faked arrest,

369
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,980
it was all a trap the Inspector and we put together.

370
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,680
So you'd put your guard down

371
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,180
and make a move proving your guilt.

372
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,480
It was all his fault.

373
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,280
He threatened to tell dad

374
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,280
about the crooked dealings my company was involved in

375
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,580
unless I called off the wedding.

376
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,880
He's the one who suggested we get married,

377
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,180
I didn't understand.

378
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,080
I thought that even if I called off the wedding,

379
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,680
he'd continue to blackmail me.

380
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,780
That's why I decided to kill him

381
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,280
and let Sakuraba take the blame since he stole my fiancee.

382
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,280
He didn't steal your fiancee.

383
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,880
Kaede was coming here to see Sakuraba all along.

384
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,180
Shigematsu misunderstood,

385
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,180
like your father did many years ago.

386
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,080
You're lying. He never said anything like that.

387
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,680
He probably couldn't because he knew how disappointed you'd be,

388
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,680
he wanted to spare you.

389
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,780
After all he himself suggested the marriage.

390
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,380
I doubt he really meant to blackmail you.

391
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,280
He just wanted to get you to cancel the wedding somehow,

392
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,080
so the two of them could get married.

393
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,680
Because he was once in the same situation a long time ago.

394
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,880
"Tokyo Station" -Thanks for everything old man.

395
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,780
Sure, now we're even since you took us around in Osaka.

396
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,080
I'm still mad you put on that show

397
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,780
without even discussing it with me.

398
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,080
To fool the enemy,

399
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,980
you must first fool your friends, or so the saying goes.

400
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,880
Hey, what happened to Sakuraba and Kaede?

401
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,280
You went to see them didn't you?

402
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:17,380
Yeah, I apologized for treating him like a perpetrator.

403
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:20,480
That Kazuha's late.

404
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,380
Forgive me, Ran.

405
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,180
I'm so embarrassed I could die.

406
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,780
Good grief. We're already here forget about it.

407
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,880
Now go.

408
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,280
What's going on, Kazuha?

409
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,980
You're wearing stripes too?

410
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,380
It... it's not what you think.

411
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,980
This is Ran's.

412
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,180
I don't know why but she made me wear it.

413
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,880
I'd better go to the restroom and change.

414
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,080
Come back here.

415
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,980
It doesn't bother me, you don't have to change.

416
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,780
Besides, it kind of looks like...

417
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,580
Looks like what?

418
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,880
It looks kind of funny, like we're brother and sister.

419
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,780
More like a comedy duo to me.

420
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,080
"Next Episode"

421
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,180
He's dead.

422
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,780
Next Conan,

423
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:32,400
"The Astronomical Observation"

424
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,480
Next Conan's Hint:

425
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,180
"Photo of the stars"

426
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,880
In the next episode, stars rain down at night.

427
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,880
Bring the net.
