1
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,690
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,690
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,890
The Matsue mystery is solved today.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,190
There are so many secrets in the lake.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,790
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,590
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,790
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,750
"Matsue Castle"

9
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,250
One autumn day,

10
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,550
the three of us went on a trip to Matsue City in Shimane.

11
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,750
At Matsue Lake Hotel, we meet a group of five people

12
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,950
who have come to compose what is called linked verses group.

13
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:09,950
The next day,

14
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,250
one of their members, Mr. Gozo Ushikubo was found murdered

15
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,350
on the Matsue Castle grounds.

16
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,350
His index finger seems to be pointing to something

17
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,550
and we must find out what his dying message is.

18
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,350
I'm absolutely positive one of those four killed him

19
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,350
and we're going to find out at that poetry session!

20
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:36,450
"The Linked Poetry Incident At Tamatsukuri In Matsue (Part 2)"

21
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,450
"Tamatsukuri Spa" -Our haiku gathering will now begin.

22
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,750
There will be a total of 14 poems this time

23
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,750
for our linked verses composition.

24
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,550
Also, to make it easier for Mr. Mouri who is a beginner,

25
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,250
we'll do it with a word game style,

26
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,550
using the last syllable of the previous word to start the new verse.

27
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,450
A word game?

28
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,450
Yes.

29
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,450
There are only a few rules you have to follow.

30
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,550
Other than that, it's pretty much anything goes.

31
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,150
First, we start with a 5-7-5 poem for the opening

32
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:08,650
then follow with a 7-7 poem, and another 5-7-5 and so forth.

33
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,150
However, you have to be careful not to link your poem

34
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,050
to the two poems before yours which is called "uchikoshi".

35
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,950
After that, all you have to do is include the four seasons

36
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,750
in some of the fourteen poems.

37
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,850
In between, we'll include one poem referring to the moon,

38
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,650
three love poems,

39
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,950
the thirteenth poem will refer to flowers.

40
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,450
And the closing poem will be a poem

41
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,850
about Spring bringing it to a happy end.

42
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,250
That's all you have to remember.

43
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,750
Sure.

44
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,550
Hey, are you sure you can handle it?

45
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,050
Well, let's just start and see.

46
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,750
First is the opening poem.

47
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,950
The poems you all wrote...

48
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,550
Mr. Shiina's,

49
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,050
"Even Gods will gather and gaze upon Deer's Window."

50
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,550
Mr. Yagisawa's,

51
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,450
"To the huge turtle, a mantis does raise its ax in reverence forsooth."

52
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,850
Mizuki's,

53
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,050
"Soft and gently where the sun shines upon

54
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,950
the dancing autumn leaves."

55
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,150
And now Mr. Ushikubo's poem,

56
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,450
"Autumn surges, there's no sorrow in my life."

57
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,750
I think they are all good poems.

58
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,350
But since this session is dedicated to Mr. Ushikubo,

59
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,450
I'd like to use his poem as the opener.

60
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,750
-Okay. -Okay.

61
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,250
All right. Will someone continue for the "waki"?

62
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,350
What is a "waki"?

63
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,350
It's the second poem.

64
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,550
Like hokku, it contains reference to the season.

65
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,150
I'll go.

66
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,950
Within the silence, I hear a nut falling from the tree.

67
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,550
That's very good. You interpreted the opener very cleverly.

68
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,250
All right. Why don't you go next, Mr Yagisawa?

69
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,450
Okay.

70
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,850
I wonder if dad will be able to do it.

71
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,650
The guy is about as boorish as he can be.

72
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,250
I'm done.

73
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,950
Under the moonlight, Dracula comes to join me in verse.

74
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,950
That's quite amusing.

75
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,250
The use of Dracula,

76
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,050
a very radical character is very stimulating.

77
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,550
Is that kind of poem allowed?

78
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,350
Yes, for the third poem, you can let yourself go.

79
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,850
Let your imagination go wild.

80
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,750
Let the imagination go wild?

81
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,350
Ms. Mizuki, it's your turn.

82
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,450
Okay.

83
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,950
That text I see there seems to be made in Japan.

84
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:34,850
I think it'd be better to use the word textbook instead of text.

85
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,950
It's all right if you have an extra word.

86
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,150
Okay.

87
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,450
-Mr. Mouri. -Yes!

88
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,650
Would you like to give it a try?

89
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,650
Use the last syllable of the last word,

90
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,150
so you'll have to start with a "pan" or "han" word.

91
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,550
All right!

92
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,050
Here goes!

93
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,050
Catching the killer will prove to all that I am a great detective.

94
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,150
Well, what do you think?

95
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,750
Let's see.

96
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,050
"Great detective" and "Dracula" do seem to belong to the same realm

97
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,350
which would bring us back to the "uchikoshi",

98
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,250
but I guess it's all night.

99
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,550
All right, I'm next.

100
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,250
What the future holds for us is what God alone knows for certain.

101
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,250
Bravo, Ms. Reiko.

102
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,750
You've subtly challenged the detective.

103
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,550
Are you saying solving the case won't be so easy?

104
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,650
All right, I'll go next.

105
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,250
"Ru"...

106
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,150
Done!

107
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,350
Human-like monkey,

108
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,950
your face does remind me of the girl next to me.

109
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,750
Funny, isn't it?

110
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,150
The 7th syllable, "O" is the main point.

111
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,450
Huh? What does he mean?

112
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,350
Huh?

113
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,550
Mr. Yagisawa.

114
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,950
Here.

115
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,950
I found it in the lobby just now.

116
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,350
Gosh. I must have dropped it again.

117
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,450
Thank you.

118
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,950
Don't mention it.

119
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,450
I see.

120
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,850
You're all so very good!

121
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,050
How's it going. Mr. Mouri?

122
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,450
Well, not very good actually.

123
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,550
Three more poems to go.

124
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,750
We've got to do something soon.

125
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,550
Hey, Ms. Mizuki.

126
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,050
Didn't you say you wrote the first poem

127
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,650
while you were looking at the autumn leaves

128
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,250
at the rest area in the grounds of the samurai residence?

129
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,650
Yes.

130
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,250
That's strange.

131
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,250
I went there just a little while ago.

132
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,150
But I couldn't see the leaves from the rest area.

133
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,450
Is that true, Conan?

134
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,150
Yes.

135
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,450
I probably saw the autumn leaves in another location.

136
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,200
Another location?

137
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,400
Where was that?

138
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,100
Well...

139
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,600
Is Ms. Mizuki the killer?

140
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,000
If she isn't, why did she lie like that?

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,200
This poem... Could it be...

142
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,300
That means she's doing it for that person.

143
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,700
But what did that dying message mean?

144
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,500
So that's what it meant.

145
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,100
But why did that person do something like this?

146
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,700
I've got it!

147
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,500
Now, I understand!

148
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,600
Orders from Mr. Mouri for me?

149
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,200
Yes. He said not to tell Detective Yasurai,

150
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,300
and he wants you to investigate something.

151
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,200
All right! I understand!

152
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,800
If my deduction is correct,

153
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,900
that person is the killer.

154
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,610
I've got it!

155
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,410
What do you mean?

156
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,010
I know what Mr. Ushikubo's dying message is.

157
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,910
He wasn't pointing to the bamboo.

158
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,810
He was pointing to something beyond that.

159
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,010
Something beyond the bamboo?

160
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,410
Past the shrubs around the walk way

161
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,410
and past Horikawa.

162
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,510
That's right!

163
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,510
It's the site of the samurai homes

164
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,710
where Ms. Mizuki went to compose her poem.

165
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,010
Which means the killer

166
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,310
is you, Ms. Mizuki!

167
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,110
That's not true.

168
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,110
Hey, Ms. Mizuki!

169
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:00,010
The 10th poem here, it's a love poem, right?

170
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,610
And it's a one sided love.

171
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,610
Huh?

172
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,110
And another thing. Mr. Yagisawa.

173
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,910
During dinner, you were whistling, right?

174
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,910
Oh, yes.

175
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,710
So that's what it is!

176
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:16,010
Mizuki is in love with Yagisawa.

177
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,210
I see. So that's why last night, she...

178
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,410
What about last night?

179
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:25,410
Mr. Ushikubo said something cruel to Mr. Yagisawa last night.

180
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,610
Ms. Mizuki was watching them and she looked very worried.

181
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,710
Wait just a minute.

182
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,910
Are you saying...

183
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,010
Oh, I get it!

184
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,910
Ms. Mizuki, are you trying to protect Mr. Yagisawa?

185
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,410
What do you mean by that, Mr. Mouri?

186
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,710
I mean that she was concerned about what happened

187
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:50,510
between Mr. Ushikubo and Mr. Yagisawa last night,

188
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,510
so she changed her plans

189
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:55,010
and went to Matsue Castle to see Mr. Ushikubo.

190
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:58,710
But when she got there, she saw...

191
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,010
No, you're wrong!

192
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,510
I saw no such thing!

193
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,510
All I saw was...

194
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,310
What did you saw?

195
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,610
Ms. Mizuki.

196
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:18,010
Ms. Mizuki, I think it'd be better if you told the truth.

197
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,610
But, Ms. Reiko...

198
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,610
I agree with her.

199
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,010
I'm sorry if I sounded cocky.

200
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,910
But if you really do love him,

201
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,410
and if you really think he's special...

202
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,010
At first, I had planned to go to Gessho Temple,

203
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,410
not Matsue Castle.

204
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,510
Because I was worried about Mr. Yagisawa.

205
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:49,910
But the bus heading to Matsue Castle passed by

206
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,810
and I saw Mr. Yagisawa in it.

207
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:59,210
So I headed for Matsue Castle right away.

208
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:02,510
But when I got to the walk way,

209
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,910
Mr. Ushikubo was already dead.

210
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,110
And at his fingertip, I found...

211
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,810
After that, I rushed back to the samurai residences

212
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,910
and sat in the rest area until I calmed down.

213
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:22,210
Then when it was time to meet back, I went back to the hotel.

214
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,910
Wait a minute.

215
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,610
Sure, it's true I went to the castle.

216
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,310
But I didn't kill him,

217
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,010
and I didn't go to the walk way either.

218
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,210
Then, what part of the castle did you go to?

219
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,810
To the Jouzan Inari Shrine.

220
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,910
That's where there's a lot of fox statues, right?

221
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,710
That's where Mr. Ushikubo told me to meet him.

222
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:45,610
About 30 minutes after I got to Gessho Temple,

223
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,510
I got an e-mail from Mr. Ushikubo on my phone.

224
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,910
It said "Come to the Jouzan Inari Shrine at Matsue Castle right now."

225
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,610
It was about 10:05 am when I got to the shrine.

226
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:04,910
I waited about fifteen minutes, but he never showed up.

227
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,510
So I tried calling his phone, but there was no answer.

228
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,210
There was nothing I could do, so I went back to Gessho Temple

229
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,710
and composed the poem about the big turtle.

230
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:18,210
Then, why was your eye medicine at the crime scene?

231
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,010
I don't know.

232
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:22,410
I'm telling you the truth detective!

233
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,510
If you don't believe me,

234
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,110
check Mr. Ushikubo's phone.

235
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,610
We've already checked all the data on his phone.

236
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,910
But there's no record of any message to you like you claimed.

237
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,710
That's impossible!

238
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,910
How about his spare phone?

239
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,710
Mr. Ushikubo said he always carried a spare in his bag.

240
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,510
We have checked all his belonging,

241
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,910
but there was only one phone.

242
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,610
Mr. Yagisawa.

243
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:50,710
You stole Mr. Ushikubo's spare phone

244
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,410
and sent yourself that message, right?

245
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,010
No, that's not true!

246
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,210
Detective Yasugi!

247
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,810
-We have found the murder weapon! -What?

248
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,610
We found it in the lotus pond at Gessho Temple.

249
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,110
The nightstick was wrapped in this raincoat,

250
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,110
and the blood on it matched the victim.

251
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,510
And this raincoat...

252
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,410
Yagisawa?

253
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,410
That settles it.

254
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,410
That's impossible.

255
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,010
Come on! You can tell us all about it at the station.

256
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,360
Officer, it wasn't me.

257
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,660
You're making a big mistake!

258
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,360
Mr. Yagisawa!

259
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,160
Oh, boy. What a poetry composing trip this has turned into.

260
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,760
Let's end today's session.

261
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,360
Good idea.

262
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,260
Excuse me, I have a poem I would like to contribute.

263
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,260
You're starting with "chi" next, aren't you?

264
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,160
I'm finished!

265
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,060
Yummy chocolate candy, hurry and give me some now.

266
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,860
No, that's not what you called linked verses!

267
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,560
No.

268
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,060
You associated chocolate candy with "ant trail", right?

269
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,560
That's a very amusing poem befitting a child.

270
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,560
The next one should be a flower poem.

271
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,760
Mr. Shiina, you do it.

272
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,860
Come on! Make a poem starting with "I" sound.

273
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,560
Make it a pretty one!

274
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,560
All right, then!

275
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,760
I'm done.

276
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,960
Someday, my daughter and I will go to a temple with flowers.

277
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,560
-What do you think? -How strange.

278
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,960
It's really strange.

279
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:01,160
That's the poem Pops read to me just a little while ago.

280
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,560
Look.

281
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,060
When did you write that, dad?

282
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,560
Well, I...

283
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,060
Matsue...

284
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,460
Tamatsukuri!

285
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,660
-Dad? -Ran.

286
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,460
The truth is, I didn't write that poem.

287
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,360
Mr. Tomonaga, the man we met in the lobby yesterday

288
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,260
from the brokerage firm wrote it.

289
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,960
Mr. Ushikubo had written it down in his memo pad.

290
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,060
Mr. Shiina.

291
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:44,660
You were convinced Mr. Ushikubo came up with it himself, right?

292
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,160
He was such a cruel man,

293
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,660
so you couldn't forgive him for writing such a beautiful poem.

294
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,860
That's why you tore it out of his memo pad, didn't you?

295
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,360
After you killed him, of course.

296
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,860
Your poems had secret messages in them, right?

297
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,960
The seventh syllable in the seventh poem,

298
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,760
the ninth syllable in the ninth poem,

299
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,960
and the eleventh syllable in the eleventh poem.

300
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,960
"I'm the killer".

301
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:20,560
That was your challenge to me.

302
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,160
You secretly put messages in your poems

303
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,360
mocking both the police and me,

304
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,860
you must have been enjoying yourself.

305
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,960
Judging from your personality

306
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,560
and given the right conditions,

307
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,060
I knew you would use the poem you stole from Mr. Ushikubo.

308
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:39,460
So, I had you pegged.

309
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,460
Because this is the kind of poem you like.

310
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,460
My favorite poems are those with feelings,

311
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,860
like how a father feels for his daughter.

312
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,560
The conditions were perfect.

313
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,260
Then when Mr. Yagisawa was taken away

314
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,560
as the suspect in the murder,

315
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,760
the thirteenth poem was a flower poem

316
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,560
so I composed the previous poem setting things up for you.

317
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,960
So that's why you told Conan to do the twelfth poem.

318
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,060
That's right.

319
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,260
And just as I figured,

320
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:15,060
you used Mr. Ushikubo's poem

321
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,360
because you were so sure that you have won.

322
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,660
The secret message in the poems was just a joke.

323
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,160
And about that poem,

324
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,260
Mr. Ushikubo showed it to me last night.

325
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,060
Besides, I have an alibi.

326
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,160
An alibi?

327
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,960
That's right. I just remembered that at about 10:05 am,

328
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,960
I saw a female attendant at the art museum

329
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,560
found the parents of a lost boy.

330
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,960
You could have set up a video camera below the hedges there

331
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,660
and see it on the tape.

332
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,360
Conan found marks left behind by a tripod.

333
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,660
When you arrived at the art museum this morning,

334
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,860
you set a video camera up underneath the hedges.

335
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,560
Then you sent an e-mail to Mr. Yagisawa

336
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,560
with Mr. Ushikubo's spare phone,

337
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,260
which you had stolen beforehand.

338
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,260
Then, you went to Matsue Castle and killed Mr. Ushikubo.

339
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,760
After that, you put Mr. Yagisawa's eye medicine

340
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,560
by Mr. Ushikubo's finger.

341
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,260
And went to Gessho Temple

342
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,360
to get rid of the raincoat and murder weapon,

343
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,960
then went back to the art museum for the video.

344
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,060
Finally, you came back to the hotel

345
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,560
pretending like nothing happened.

346
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,560
That's a very interesting story. Mr. Mouri.

347
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,060
I hate to disappoint you though...

348
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,660
I have the evidence to prove it.

349
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,460
It's Mr. Ushikubo's dying message.

350
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:45,860
He wasn't pointing to the bamboo or the samurai residence.

351
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,560
He was making the number one.

352
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,160
What's that supposed to mean?

353
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,460
Ran, what's the first poem in linked verses called?

354
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,860
Hokku.

355
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,960
Now, Officer Tsubaki, give us the results from the lab.

356
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,660
Yes, sir.

357
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,260
This is Mr. Shiina's shoe.

358
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,960
The left front hook on the left shoe

359
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,760
is where we found a bloody fingerprint

360
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,460
which matched Mr. Ushikubo's right index finger and it was his blood.

361
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:20,360
He was telling us to check your shoe in his dying message.

362
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,760
You were probably so engrossed with his memo pad

363
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,660
that you didn't notice he touched your shoe, right?

364
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,960
I give up, Mr. Mouri.

365
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,760
You're right. I killed him.

366
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,560
But what made you suspicious of me?

367
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:43,660
The first thing I found strange was last night's drawing of lots.

368
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,860
Usually, the person who makes the lots will draw it last

369
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,760
but you went second.

370
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,560
Since we're taking turns according to age,

371
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,660
so the next one is me.

372
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,660
You rigged the drawing

373
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,610
so that Mr. Ushikubo would pick a place

374
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,010
that would make killing him easy

375
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:04,310
and your place would be far away giving you an excellent alibi.

376
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:11,610
No wonder you're the country's best private detective.

377
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,810
So, your motive for killing Mr. Ushikubo was...

378
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:18,410
I couldn't forgive him for lying

379
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,010
and cheating us out of our money.

380
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:23,310
But that doesn't give you the right to pass sentence on him.

381
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,410
Yes, I know that.

382
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,710
I know that very well.

383
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,710
I know only God can pass judgement on him.

384
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:42,210
I guess the God of Izumo brought you here to teach that to me.

385
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,810
I'm so happy for them.

386
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,210
It looks like Mr. Yagisawa

387
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,610
feels the same for Ms. Mizuki.

388
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,510
It certainly does.

389
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,310
By the way, Ms. Reiko.

390
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,710
There is still one poem left for the linked verses.

391
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,710
All right, then. This one will express my gratitude to Mr. Mouri

392
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,410
and how I feel about Matsue City.

393
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:38,610
Infamous Lafcadio Hearn smiles brightly and Spring arrives.

394
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,310
That's a wonderful poem!

395
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,210
Isn't that right, dad?

396
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,210
Lafcalio?

397
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,310
It's Lafcadio Hearn!

398
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,510
It's about Yakumo Koizumi.

399
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,210
Koizumi...

400
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,810
At this rate,

401
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,710
Lafcadio Hearn, the spring of his amazement,

402
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,010
would be more appropriate.

403
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,440
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,240
"Offertory box"
