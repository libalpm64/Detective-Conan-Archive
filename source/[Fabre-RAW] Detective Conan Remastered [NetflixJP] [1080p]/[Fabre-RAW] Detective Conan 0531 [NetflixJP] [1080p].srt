1
00:00:02,741 --> 00:00:05,341
A culprit who goes after long-haired women

2
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:06,941
attacking them with a hammer.

3
00:00:06,941 --> 00:00:08,941
He is known as Hammer man.

4
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:11,541
Through an eye-witness report,

5
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:14,541
the condo where Hammer man is thought to reside is pinpointed.

6
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:20,341
Officer Takagi and other officers secretly stake out.

7
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:22,001
They try to keep the culprit from seeing through their surveillance

8
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,003
by putting on a lovey-dovey situation.

9
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:25,641
Officer Chiba reports that

10
00:00:25,641 --> 00:00:30,941
three people went in and out of the room that they were watching.

11
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:34,941
One of them was a male courier who came to pick up a parcel.

12
00:00:34,941 --> 00:00:37,441
The second person was a woman motorbike courier

13
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:39,341
who came to deliver a parcel.

14
00:00:39,341 --> 00:00:43,141
The third one was a man from the pizza shop who came to deliver pizza.

15
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:44,023
However,

16
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:47,241
all three people say that they did not see the resident of the condo.

17
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:50,029
They explain that a note telling them to come into the room

18
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:53,241
and do what they have to was posted on the front door.

19
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,037
Thinking that this may be

20
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:02,741
a strategy that Hammer man thought up to escape the condo,

21
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:06,641
we decided to bust into the room that was being watched,

22
00:01:06,641 --> 00:01:08,341
but when we got there,

23
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:11,541
we found a man that had been hit on the head and seriously injured.

24
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:16,041
Is he Hammer man?

25
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:20,341
Did one of the three who entered the room strike him?

26
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:23,041
There could've been a person connected to

27
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:27,241
one of the women who were attacked by Hammer man among the three people.

28
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:30,069
Although the police wanted to verify the identities of the three,

29
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:33,641
they had already been allowed to leave.

30
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:36,541
After going in to investigate the room with the officers,

31
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:39,041
we found several suspicious points.

32
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:41,041
Only the invoice of the pizza delivery was left behind

33
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:44,941
and the invoices of the courier and motorbike delivery were gone.

34
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:48,741
The plug of a chargeable electric shaver was not plugged in.

35
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:51,441
The bath tub is spic-and-span and super clean.

36
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:52,841
Strange.

37
00:01:52,841 --> 00:01:56,095
There must be something behind this incident.

38
00:01:56,095 --> 00:02:00,099
Something that is beyond our imagination.

39
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:03,541
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

40
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,641
Saturday nights are for mystery.

41
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:07,641
The surprising identity of Hammer man.

42
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:10,109
Funny Detective Queen Sonoko makes her appearance.

43
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:11,641
He sees through the one and only truth.

44
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:13,541
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

45
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:15,341
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

46
00:03:56,859 --> 00:04:00,219
"The Truth of the Urban Legend (Part 2)".

47
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,759
When we checked inside the dryer and washing machine,

48
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:09,559
we found these gloves among the laundry.

49
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:12,659
We'll have the forensic officers check it

50
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:16,235
and if the blood matches with those of the victim last night,

51
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:18,237
the man that was found lying on the floor here

52
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:21,059
is definitely Hammer man.

53
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:22,241
All we need to do now is

54
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:25,559
find the remains of anything that belonged to the one who hit Hammer man.

55
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:28,247
That could lead to some clue.

56
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:29,159
None here!

57
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:31,859
All the clothes that are here

58
00:04:31,859 --> 00:04:34,253
were inside the dryer and washer, weren't they?

59
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:38,257
If so, I wonder why there are

60
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:40,659
no underwear or socks.

61
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:41,959
True.

62
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:45,359
Although there are T-shirts, sweat shirts and towels.

63
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:48,267
Maybe they were all thrown away after being used.

64
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:51,659
Well, when I had to stake out for more than a week or so,

65
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,859
I used to throw away my underwear

66
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:55,859
without washing them too, at times like that.

67
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:58,277
Stake out...

68
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:01,059
You pretended to be lovers so that people wouldn't notice

69
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:03,959
that you were staking out, right?

70
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:06,759
What did you think it was?

71
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,287
Oh, no.

72
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:13,459
Is something the matter?

73
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:14,293
Chiba.

74
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:17,359
You staked out with Officer Sato in the past, didn't you?

75
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,159
Yes, two or three times.

76
00:05:19,159 --> 00:05:21,659
Did... did anything happen back then?

77
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:23,359
What do you mean?

78
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:26,659
No, if nothing happened, that's okay.

79
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,759
Is it that

80
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,309
you want to know whether I pretended being lovers with Officer Sato?

81
00:05:31,859 --> 00:05:33,859
Officer Sato seems to do it a lot

82
00:05:33,859 --> 00:05:35,559
to keep people from noticing that we're officers.

83
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:38,759
But, as for me, something like that during a stake out

84
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,759
will totally distract me from my duty.

85
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,359
Don't tell me that you...

86
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:48,327
Yes, I could never forget that soft touch.

87
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:51,259
Soft touch?

88
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:53,759
Kiss me. Right now.

89
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,059
A hot passionate one.

90
00:05:56,059 --> 00:05:58,359
What?

91
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,859
Did you find something?

92
00:06:00,859 --> 00:06:01,959
No.

93
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,659
Excuse me.

94
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:07,459
I think it's about time I take Conan home, if it's okay.

95
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:08,859
I guess so.

96
00:06:08,859 --> 00:06:10,349
Thank you, Conan.

97
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:13,459
You can leave finding Hammer man to the police.

98
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:14,959
But...

99
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,559
Then, the person who was carried away on the stretcher

100
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:18,759
was also attacked by Hammer man?

101
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:22,159
No, the person that was carried off on the stretcher is Hammer man.

102
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:24,359
A person connected with one of his victims

103
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:25,859
probably took revenge and attacked him.

104
00:06:25,859 --> 00:06:27,059
No way!

105
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:31,159
I thought that Hammer man was over 180 centimetres tall.

106
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:33,159
The person who was carried away

107
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,375
didn't look to be that tall at all, did he?

108
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,377
That's what the urban legend's about.

109
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:40,859
The victims were all attacked from behind,

110
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:45,159
and only got to see the attacker's rear view from the groundwhere they are,

111
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:47,959
so, the accurate height of the culprit is unknown.

112
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:51,959
Although last night's eye-witness was on his feet,

113
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:54,393
he seems to have been drunk, so...

114
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:56,759
Urban legend...

115
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,059
Wait a sec.

116
00:06:58,059 --> 00:07:00,159
A bathroom that's too clean,

117
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:02,401
an unplugged electric shaver,

118
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:03,859
and a toothbrush for some reason that weren't there,

119
00:07:03,859 --> 00:07:05,859
including no underwear or socks...

120
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:09,359
And the note that was found in front of the room,

121
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:12,411
the invoices of the courier and motorbike courier that disappeared...

122
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,059
Don't tell me that...

123
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,159
There is a piece of leather flap attached to the tip of the left shoe!

124
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:27,459
Where are the other shoes?

125
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:31,659
This is the only shoe with a leather flap attached to it!

126
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,659
Hey!

127
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:36,459
Conan.

128
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:39,859
Does something bother you about Hammer man's shoe?

129
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:43,359
No, these aren't the shoes of Hammer man.

130
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:46,759
He wasn't here to begin with.

131
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,759
What?

132
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,759
The man called Hammer man.

133
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,259
What do you mean,

134
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:54,453
saying that Hammer man wasn't here to begin with?

135
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:57,259
You know, like the woman with snake-like mouth

136
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:58,859
and dog that has a human-like face,

137
00:07:58,859 --> 00:08:00,459
rumour exaggerates

138
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:03,159
and they become really frightening characters, right?

139
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:04,759
Hammer man is said

140
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,459
to have run 100m in 11 seconds,

141
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:12,471
or be a tall man with a height over 180cm.

142
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:14,759
What I'm saying is that rumour exaggerates the facts

143
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:18,059
and ends up going around scaring people.

144
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:21,359
Woman like a snake-like mouth and a dog that has a human-like face...

145
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:24,159
You sure know a lot about old horror characters, don't you?

146
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:27,059
My teacher at school told us about them.

147
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:28,859
But Conan,

148
00:08:28,859 --> 00:08:30,489
unlike the woman with the snake-like mouth

149
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:32,259
and the dog with a human-like face,

150
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:36,959
there are actually four people who were victimized by Hammer man.

151
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,959
It's hard to believe that he's an imaginary character.

152
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,959
That just goes to show that there's a bad man

153
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:44,959
that's attacking long-haired woman with a hammer,

154
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,859
and we don't really know if that's the Hammer man or not, do we?

155
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:50,509
He's going around attacking people with hammers,

156
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:52,511
so he's a Hammer man, isn't he?

157
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:55,059
Are you saying that it was actually not a hammer?

158
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:57,159
So what I mean is...

159
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,517
What?

160
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:00,959
Talk louder so that everybody can hear...

161
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,525
Sonoko?

162
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:08,527
That... that queer dance...

163
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:09,759
Don't say that...

164
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,559
Yes, dance.

165
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:17,359
Conan's remark inspired me!

166
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:20,539
We were dancing around.

167
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,159
In other words, being deceived by an urban legend called Hammer man!

168
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:27,959
She's come! Deduction Queen Sonoko!

169
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:32,551
But she resembles Sleeping Kogoro in every way, doesn't she?

170
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:34,359
Of course she does.

171
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:36,259
No, I think the angle her head is facing down

172
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:38,859
is different from that of Mr. Mouri's.

173
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:40,559
Is... is that so?

174
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,559
There's no difference.

175
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,259
But, Sonoko,

176
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:47,059
if Hammer man is simply an urban legend,

177
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:51,140
who was that man that was knocked down and passed out in this room?

178
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,359
The only plausible explanation

179
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,859
is that one of the three who came to this room

180
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:57,959
hit Hammer man because of a grudge.

181
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:01,059
Think back and try to remember the details.

182
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:05,059
In what order and for what the three came to the room for?

183
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:09,359
If I remember correctly,

184
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:14,059
it was a tall male courier about 180 centimeters in height,

185
00:10:14,059 --> 00:10:18,159
a woman motorbike courier who is barely 160 meters tall,

186
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:23,959
and last, a thin pizza delivery man about 170 centimeters tall.

187
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:26,159
Those three who came to the room

188
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,759
because there was a note by the front door

189
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,159
telling them to come in and do what they had to

190
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:33,659
since the resident was in bed with a cold.

191
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:35,859
You can see that the only person who could've put that note there

192
00:10:35,859 --> 00:10:40,359
was the courier who came along first, right?

193
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:42,621
Then, the only one who could've hidden

194
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:45,759
the invoices of the courier and the motorbike woman courier

195
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:47,559
is either the motorbike delivery woman

196
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:51,959
or the pizza delivery man, right that came after the male courier, right?

197
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:55,459
Yes, that's what's been troubling us from a while ago.

198
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:59,359
But if you think of it this way, maybe the puzzle will fit?

199
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:02,659
If we were to assume that it was Hammer man who was in this room

200
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:05,659
that left the memo by the door, as well as hid the invoices!

201
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,759
It's true that he could've placed the memo there,

202
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,959
but why would Hammer man have to hide the invoices?

203
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:18,059
To keep the police from identifying who is who right away.

204
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:20,359
Because the culprit is just about to switch over

205
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:22,359
to being someone else right now!

206
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:23,359
What?

207
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:25,859
Switch? Don't tell me...

208
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:29,859
You mean Hammer man switched to one of those three?

209
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:33,159
Yes, Hammer man called the motorbike deliverer

210
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:37,359
and pizza delivery man in order to switch identities with them.

211
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:38,359
In other words,

212
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:40,679
the one who was knocked out and fainted in that room

213
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:43,559
was one of the three!

214
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,683
I see.

215
00:11:44,859 --> 00:11:46,685
So when the people the culprit called,

216
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:50,959
came to the room and followed the instructions on the memo by the door,

217
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,059
he knocked them out, put his clothes on them,

218
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:56,695
and set it up as if the man committed suicide.

219
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:58,259
The culprit left the man in the room,

220
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,259
wore the uniform of the man he knocked out

221
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:02,701
and left straightforwardly out the front door.

222
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:03,959
If so,

223
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,959
the first male courier that came

224
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,459
is cleared from the list of suspects.

225
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,709
After all, his physique is much too different from that of the man

226
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:12,711
who was knocked out in the room.

227
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:15,759
Besides, he couldn't have taken away the invoice of the motorbike courier

228
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,959
who came along later.

229
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:22,721
Which means that Hammer man is the pizza delivery man!

230
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:25,859
It's understandable that he hasn't returned to shop yet too, then.

231
00:12:25,859 --> 00:12:26,725
Okay.

232
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:28,359
Form a cordon right away

233
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:29,359
and look for the pizza delivery man.

234
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:32,359
My, my. Haven't you danced enough yet?

235
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:33,359
What?

236
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:36,059
After hearing of the situation of the room a while ago from Conan,

237
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:37,759
I figured it out right away,

238
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,459
that is, the identity of Hammer man.

239
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,759
Situation of the room?

240
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:44,359
About the bathroom being spic-and-span,

241
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:48,259
the chargeable shaver being unplugged,

242
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:50,259
no toothbrush.

243
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:55,259
As well as that fact that there were no underwear or socks in the laundry.

244
00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:58,159
What... what can you tell with all that information?

245
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,559
Can't you tell?

246
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:01,059
As for the bathroom being spic-and-span

247
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:02,761
and the toothbrush being taken away,

248
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,759
it was to get rid of any traces of she living in the room

249
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:07,659
until just a while ago,

250
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:10,769
and the reason the shaver was unplugged

251
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,959
was simply because it hasn't been used recently.

252
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,759
There were no underwear and socks among the laundry

253
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:20,259
in order to hide what gender the culprit is.

254
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:21,959
You get it now, don't you?

255
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:23,759
Don't tell me that...

256
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,785
Don't tell me that Hammer man is...

257
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:35,229
Don't tell me that Hammer man is...

258
00:13:35,229 --> 00:13:36,529
a woman?

259
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:38,129
The motorbike delivery person?

260
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:40,329
Yes, the underwear as well as the socks,

261
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:42,129
she hid because they would obviously

262
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:44,829
be much smaller in size than that of men!

263
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:46,429
She didn't want anyone to find out

264
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:48,829
that the resident of this room was a woman.

265
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:52,129
It... it's true that the culprit was called Hammer man,

266
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:56,129
but none of the victims said that they were attacked by a man.

267
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:59,329
It could've been a name that the media gave the culprit

268
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:02,629
because the attack was a brutal one with the weapon used being a hammer.

269
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:05,829
Giving the culprit a certain name catches on fast, so...

270
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:06,825
Come to think of it,

271
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:09,329
I was told that the one who rented this room was a man,

272
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:12,529
but that he had a woman living together with him.

273
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:16,029
In other words, the one who disappeared from this room was the man,

274
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:18,837
and the woman kept living here.

275
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:23,629
Well, if you look at the shoe with the leather flap that Conan found,

276
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,729
everything is quite apparent!

277
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:27,929
This is a shift pad that is used to protect the tip of the shoe

278
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:31,829
from the impact of stepping on the shift pedal of the motorbike.

279
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,853
Being that there was only one such shoe in the shoe cabinet

280
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:38,857
and no other shoe with a damaged tip means that...

281
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:41,629
The owner of the shoe wasn't the resident of this condo,

282
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:43,429
but rather the motorbike person.

283
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:44,529
In other words, it was the shoe of the man

284
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:46,629
who was knocked out after a blow on the head.

285
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:50,329
She probably took the woman's shoes she was wearing, her clothes

286
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:53,429
and her underwear away with her,

287
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:54,873
after packing them in her knapsack

288
00:14:54,873 --> 00:14:57,829
that she said received from the motorbike delivery person.

289
00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:01,329
The high heeled boots that she wore to make the culprit look tall

290
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:03,829
are probably in there too.

291
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:04,883
I see.

292
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:08,229
The drunk that saw her couldn't have caught up with her

293
00:15:08,229 --> 00:15:11,829
unless she was wearing those boots that were in trend some years ago.

294
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:13,229
But...

295
00:15:13,229 --> 00:15:17,329
if so, why isn't the pizza delivery man still not back?

296
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:18,897
It's very likely that he's been hit by the culprit

297
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:22,529
and being confined somewhere.

298
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:25,729
Because if he doesn't return, the police will probably suspect him.

299
00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:26,905
Okay!

300
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:28,907
This time for sure form a cordon and...

301
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:31,329
Maybe that won't be necessary.

302
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:32,329
What?

303
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:34,913
But, unless we go after her fast, she may flee on the motorbike.

304
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:36,915
If she could ride a motorbike,

305
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:37,829
she wouldn't leave this shoe

306
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:40,919
with a shift pad on it behind like this, would she?

307
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:42,029
In other words,

308
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:44,923
I'm sure she'd like to get out of the jumpsuit she's wearing.

309
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:45,829
Because the way she's dressed now,

310
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:48,529
it would make it difficult for her to even flag a cab.

311
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:50,129
The best place to get out of her jumpsuit

312
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:52,429
would be in a bathroom somewhere.

313
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:54,029
But if she would go inside a family restaurant wearing a jumpsuit,

314
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:54,933
it would be too conspicuous.

315
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:56,029
And besides, there's a chance that someone

316
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:59,829
would remember her face and clothing after she comes out changed.

317
00:15:59,829 --> 00:16:02,629
So, a bathroom where she could avoid all this would be...

318
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,229
A bathroom in a park!

319
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,729
The one nearest here

320
00:16:05,729 --> 00:16:08,629
is where the incident occurred last night, in Beika Park!

321
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:11,329
It's being investigated now.

322
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:19,929
Phooey, stupid guy.

323
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:22,229
To take that lie to be true...

324
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:25,529
You know the toilet in the park that I went to a while ago,

325
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:26,965
one of the compartments wouldn't open,

326
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:28,967
so will you come check it out with me?

327
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:32,971
It bothers me because it's the park where Hammer man appeared, you see.

328
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:34,973
Oh, okay.

329
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,129
There's no such toilet.

330
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:40,129
That's strange.

331
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:42,629
It was closed just a while ago.

332
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:46,985
All I need to do now is get out of this jumpsuit

333
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:48,429
get out of this park

334
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:51,929
and flee to where the stupid police won't find me.

335
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:54,729
Is anything wrong?

336
00:16:56,329 --> 00:16:58,329
I'm the police.

337
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:02,129
You know that an incident occurred here last night, don't you?

338
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:04,429
Oh, yes, sir!

339
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:08,129
Is there something in the toilet?

340
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:09,529
No.

341
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,629
I don't know if it has anything to do with the incident,

342
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:15,329
but a person is lying on the ground in the toilet beyond.

343
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,019
True.

344
00:17:21,229 --> 00:17:23,629
I'll call my men to come over right away.

345
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:28,029
So, please let me interrogate you for a while.

346
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:30,029
Yes, sir. My pleasure.

347
00:17:34,629 --> 00:17:36,729
We've got a report on you.

348
00:17:36,729 --> 00:17:39,629
Hammer man, was it?

349
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,043
So, Hammer man...

350
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:49,047
Rather, Hammer woman was arrested.

351
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:51,929
The curtains went down on the urban legend

352
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:55,053
before it was handed down from word of mouth.

353
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:56,429
The motive for her committing the crime,

354
00:17:56,429 --> 00:17:59,929
was a grudge she held against the man that ditched her.

355
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:02,329
The reason she attacked only women with long hair

356
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:06,629
was because the man that left her left with a woman with long hair.

357
00:18:07,229 --> 00:18:09,329
Since she was pursued by the eye-witness

358
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:11,329
and her residence was disclosed,

359
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:15,073
she tried to frame the man and make it look as if he was the culprit,

360
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:18,229
but the police caught on faster than she expected them to,

361
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:21,079
so she seems to have carried out her stupid crime.

362
00:18:22,729 --> 00:18:25,429
Thanks so much, Sonoko.

363
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:27,629
Your deduction was as fantastic as that of Sleeping Kogoro.

364
00:18:27,629 --> 00:18:31,089
Especially when you said, "My, my. Haven't you danced enough yet?"

365
00:18:31,329 --> 00:18:33,729
It really sounded like what a Deduction Queen would say!

366
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:36,429
You don't remember?

367
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:39,097
No, I mean the details.

368
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:41,099
Actually, I don't remember a thing.

369
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:43,729
Thank you too, Conan.

370
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:47,429
And, how far did you go?

371
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:49,129
How far? What?

372
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,109
What else,

373
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:53,111
but with Officer Sato of course.

374
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:55,729
It's been quite a while since you've been going with her, right?

375
00:18:55,729 --> 00:18:59,117
I don't want to tell you.

376
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:01,119
Are you by chance angry about the fact that

377
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:03,121
I acted like lovers with Officer Sato when staking out?

378
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:05,529
I'm not mad or anything.

379
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:06,929
No big deal,

380
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:09,429
because all I did was hold hands with her.

381
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:11,129
Huh?

382
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:15,129
But you mentioned something about a soft touch and all...

383
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:18,329
The touch of her hand when she grabbed mine.

384
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:22,629
Well, but right after that,

385
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,329
when I saw the way she glared at the suspect during the stake out,

386
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,729
I was scared at the look she was wearing

387
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:27,145
and kind of backed off.

388
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:29,147
Is that it?

389
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:30,429
Yeah.

390
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:32,529
It was the same with you, wasn't it, Officer Takagi,

391
00:19:32,529 --> 00:19:34,329
when you were staking out?

392
00:19:34,329 --> 00:19:36,729
No, in my case...

393
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:40,029
Kiss me.

394
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:41,529
Right now.

395
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:42,929
A hot passionate one.

396
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:47,929
I see. She said so, because it was me.

397
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:50,529
Officer Sato said so, because it was me.

398
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:01,179
We've finally found the residence

399
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:03,929
of the younger brother of the suspect of the murder case.

400
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:06,429
"First Investigation Division" -It's on the 2nd floor of a pachinko parlor

401
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:08,529
in Okuhocho 3-chome.

402
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:09,729
According to the information we have,

403
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:11,189
it's very likely that the suspect

404
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:13,629
will secretly be meeting his brother soon.

405
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,929
I want you to stake the place out like always.

406
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:20,929
I want Officer Sato who was pursuing this case to stake out with...

407
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,329
Me!

408
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:24,229
Please let me do it!

409
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:29,229
How unusual of you to say from your side that you'd like to stake out.

410
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,209
Didn't you know

411
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:33,629
that I actually love stake out?

412
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:35,213
Be on your guard.

413
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:36,829
He's the younger brother of the suspect,

414
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:38,929
but is said to be pretty violent.

415
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:40,129
Yes, sir!

416
00:20:40,129 --> 00:20:42,329
-Be careful. -I will!

417
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:45,223
What? Be careful?

418
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:52,529
There's no movement at all?

419
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:54,029
Inspector Sato.

420
00:20:56,729 --> 00:21:00,729
The name "Sato" is really common, isn't it?

421
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:05,029
It's sure a nice name.

422
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:28,929
This is Matsumoto.

423
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:29,929
I'm pursuing a man

424
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:32,929
who looks to be the serial killer suspect at Enha Pier!

425
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:34,529
What? Are you serious?

426
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:35,729
Yes, sir.

427
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,335
The model of the car as well as the color

428
00:22:37,335 --> 00:22:39,329
matches the description of the stolen car that was reported.

429
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:42,929
It's parked right now and there's only one person in the car.

430
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:44,629
Please confirm the license plate number.

431
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:46,329
Shinjuku 5...

432
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:53,351
What's up, Matsumoto? Go on.

433
00:22:53,351 --> 00:22:55,353
Whistling?

434
00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:07,365
No doubt about it, it's him.

435
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:09,367
He's whistling.

436
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:12,129
That familiar song.

437
00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:13,371
Did he see me?

438
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,129
Hey, answer me, Matsumoto!

439
00:23:20,129 --> 00:23:21,729
Matsumoto! Matsumoto!

440
00:23:22,729 --> 00:23:24,329
Superintendent Matsumoto!

441
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:28,029
Are you all right?

442
00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:30,629
You seem to have been having a bad dream.

443
00:23:30,629 --> 00:23:35,393
I'm sorry, I must've dozed off a bit.

444
00:23:35,393 --> 00:23:39,397
I think you should go home and get some rest at times.

445
00:23:39,629 --> 00:23:41,929
You've been sleeping over here for the past few days

446
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:43,401
and haven't been getting much sleep, have you?

447
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:45,929
I can't afford to rest just yet.

448
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:47,729
There's only a week left

449
00:23:47,729 --> 00:23:50,429
before the time for the serial killing case expires.

450
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,429
Even as we sit here like this,

451
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:56,429
the hands of the clock are ticking away.

452
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,292
Next Conan's Hint:

453
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:05,780
"Nickname".

454
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,224
Just as expected of Detective Queen Sonoko.

455
00:24:08,224 --> 00:24:10,300
And the Dance Queen as well, you know.
