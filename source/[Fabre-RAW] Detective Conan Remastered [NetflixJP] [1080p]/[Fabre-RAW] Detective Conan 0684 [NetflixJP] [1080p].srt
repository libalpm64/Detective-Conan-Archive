1
00:00:37,027 --> 00:00:40,019
"If you can kill me, go ahead and try. I'll be waiting inside the room."

2
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:41,827
"I'll be end up killing you, though. -From Daisaku Katsumoto"

3
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:44,527
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

4
00:00:44,527 --> 00:00:46,627
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

5
00:00:46,627 --> 00:00:48,527
The text mail that was transmitted simultaneously before the deadly fall

6
00:00:48,527 --> 00:00:50,527
was it a trick to hide the traces of a crime?

7
00:00:50,527 --> 00:00:52,031
He sees through the one and only truth.

8
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:54,027
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

9
00:00:54,027 --> 00:00:56,727
His name is Detective Conan!

10
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:44,143
"Foam, Steam, and Smoke (Part 1)"

11
00:02:44,143 --> 00:02:45,167
"Mouri Detective Agency"

12
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:46,667
I'm sorry, Conan.

13
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,167
It seems dad can't use the car.

14
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:51,267
It seems he was drinking till 5 this morning

15
00:02:51,267 --> 00:02:53,567
and he's still sleeping.

16
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:56,867
I'm sorry, but, can you and Ai go there by train?

17
00:02:56,867 --> 00:02:58,867
Yes, okay.

18
00:02:58,867 --> 00:03:00,167
Be careful, okay?

19
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:01,867
Yes.

20
00:03:01,867 --> 00:03:03,667
Come to think of it,

21
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:06,165
when I got up, pops wasn't in bed.

22
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:11,167
It seems like you couldn't get Kogoro to drive us over.

23
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:13,667
Darn. It's already 07:00 am.

24
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:15,067
Even if we walk back to the bus stop from now,

25
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:17,867
the ski bus, Dr. Agasa and the others are on would've left already.

26
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:19,667
I told you so.

27
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,867
I'm the one who forgot something,

28
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:24,183
so I, alone should've come back.

29
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:25,567
You idiot.

30
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,367
I came back with you

31
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:29,067
because there's danger of kidnap

32
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:30,767
for a child to be walking around alone, you know!

33
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:32,667
I'm no kid.

34
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:35,267
Outwardly, you look like nothing but a kid!

35
00:03:35,267 --> 00:03:37,067
But, just what do you plan to do?

36
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:39,967
We could go there by train

37
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:42,201
but we'd have to spend a lot of time transferring trains

38
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:44,203
and by the time we get there it'll be sundown.

39
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:48,207
It can't be helped we've got no other choice.

40
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:49,167
We do.

41
00:03:50,467 --> 00:03:53,467
We could have Subaru drive us over.

42
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,215
But, you don't mind?

43
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:57,667
No, why would I?

44
00:03:57,667 --> 00:04:00,219
He always looks like he has a lot of time on his hands.

45
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:02,221
Oh, no, I mean you.

46
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:04,667
You kept saying you don't like him.

47
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:07,667
I can't keep lingering on my likes and dislikes forever.

48
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:09,367
I'm no kid.

49
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:12,231
I'm telling you, that outwardly you're nothing but a kid...

50
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:15,567
But in this case, how you look on the outside has nothing to do with it.

51
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:17,367
Besides, he...

52
00:04:17,367 --> 00:04:18,967
maybe...

53
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:25,367
Yes, yes...

54
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:27,967
"Daisaku Katsumoto" -How boisterous from early morning.

55
00:04:29,467 --> 00:04:31,067
It's you.

56
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:33,567
You really came.

57
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:36,255
So, come in, will you I'll hear you out.

58
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:38,767
It's probably some boring talking anyway, so...

59
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:45,267
You're all going skiing together?

60
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:46,667
How lucky.

61
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:50,269
If I'm going either way, I guess I'll take a slide too.

62
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:53,067
I haven't moved my body for some time besides.

63
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:57,767
Oh, my, is there any reason why you need to keep your body in shape?

64
00:04:57,767 --> 00:04:59,267
Well, of course.

65
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:02,281
Because I'd like to make a good impression on women.

66
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:08,867
Officer Takagi!

67
00:05:10,867 --> 00:05:12,867
-Conan. -Staking out?

68
00:05:12,867 --> 00:05:16,295
Sort of I just changed shifts with Chiba.

69
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:20,067
But, I'm glad you got back to work faster than expected.

70
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:21,467
Yes.

71
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:24,303
But I still dream about it even now.

72
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:28,967
Well, the minute I fall off the board,

73
00:05:28,967 --> 00:05:30,767
I get up though.

74
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:33,367
I always make it a point to tell myself.

75
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:36,067
Don't worry. You haven't fallen. You haven't fallen.

76
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:37,767
He fell!

77
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:39,067
Somebody fell!

78
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:42,321
On the other side of the road?

79
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:43,967
Officer Takagi, go for it!

80
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:46,325
Let's go to the site.

81
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:47,767
Come on, hurry.

82
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:49,367
Yes.

83
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:54,333
I saw.

84
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,667
Wow!

85
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:56,867
Excuse me!

86
00:05:58,337 --> 00:06:00,339
Police.

87
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:01,767
What happened here?

88
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:08,867
This is...

89
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:11,467
I passed by while I was jogging

90
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:14,067
and suddenly he came falling from above.

91
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:16,355
I saw it too.

92
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:18,967
This happens to be my dog's walking course.

93
00:06:18,967 --> 00:06:21,667
I wonder if he fell from this condo.

94
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:24,767
Does anyone know who he is?

95
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:30,867
He's got a cell phone in his chest pocket.

96
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:32,867
True.

97
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:39,767
He sent out a strange text mail just before he fell.

98
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:44,383
Moreover, he seems to have simultaneously sent mail to several people.

99
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:47,367
Then why don't you try sending it again?

100
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:49,367
Oh, hey!

101
00:06:54,967 --> 00:06:58,867
It seems he sent it to those three.

102
00:06:58,867 --> 00:07:02,967
Which means they know this person who fell, right?

103
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:05,867
Why didn't they say anything, then?

104
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:07,267
"Keisuke Ogino (34)" -Oh, well...

105
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:10,409
I heard a loud sound and dashed out of my room.

106
00:07:10,567 --> 00:07:12,967
I didn't have time to confirm his face or anything.

107
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:15,067
"Kaori Tsukihara (28)" -Same here.

108
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:19,767
His voice was so loud that I spilled the coffee I was drinking.

109
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:22,421
"Kazutomo Sodezaki (31)" -I heard his voice and came too.

110
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:26,167
If the person who fell was the one who sent me mail,

111
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:28,427
he could be President Katsumoto?

112
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:30,429
-No. -No joke?

113
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:33,967
Is he the president?

114
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:37,267
Yes, he's the president as well as the editor

115
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:39,867
for Katsumoto publishing company, Daisaku Katsumoto.

116
00:07:39,867 --> 00:07:41,467
You know, the magazine "Weekly Great"

117
00:07:41,467 --> 00:07:43,567
that's been selling quite well recently.

118
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:47,567
Yes, the one who writes gossips of talents and such.

119
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:51,867
Both the president and the employees are living in the same condo?

120
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:52,967
It's a coincidence.

121
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:54,867
It's near the company too.

122
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:58,067
I was just thinking of moving out soon, though.

123
00:07:58,067 --> 00:08:00,459
I'm a free-lancer and not an employee.

124
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:03,067
Well, but we live on the 3rd floor

125
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:05,267
and the president lives on the 26th.

126
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:06,465
I see.

127
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:10,469
Then, may I ask you to please come to the station with me?

128
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:13,967
I've got a lot of things that I'd like to ask you.

129
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:15,767
Hey, hold it.

130
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:17,867
Are you suspecting us?

131
00:08:17,867 --> 00:08:19,067
I told you, didn't I?

132
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:21,567
That I was in my room till just a while ago.

133
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:24,483
Is there anyone who can verify that for you?

134
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:27,267
I don't think there is.

135
00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:29,467
Because all three of us, live alone.

136
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:34,493
Then, why don't we go to the rooms of the three now?

137
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:36,867
It's only been less than 4 minutes

138
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:38,967
since we heard the voice say, "He fell!" you see!

139
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:44,067
We might find something, right?

140
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:52,167
I wonder if anything can be found by checking the rooms?

141
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:54,513
Judging from the corpse,

142
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:57,167
he seems to have fallen from quite a high place.

143
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:59,167
If this is murder,

144
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:03,167
the culprit probably pushed this man out from his room

145
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:06,267
and rushed over down here.

146
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:09,367
If traces of you having been in your room till a while ago, are found,

147
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:11,667
you'll be taken off the suspect's list.

148
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:14,267
You're being asked to show your rooms right now,

149
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:17,867
because Officer Takagi happened to be at the scene.

150
00:09:17,867 --> 00:09:21,367
The culprit couldn't have known this,

151
00:09:21,367 --> 00:09:23,267
so he wouldn't have had to go through the trouble

152
00:09:23,267 --> 00:09:24,543
of going back into his room

153
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:28,867
to make it look as though he had been there all the while.

154
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:32,551
You sure know a lot when it comes to murder, don't you?

155
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:35,567
Yes, I'm a Sherlockian.

156
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:38,167
But, I'm not interested in the killing,

157
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:40,267
I'm only interested in, solving the mystery part.

158
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:41,767
Is that so...

159
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:48,567
Okay, will Ms. Kaori and Mr. Sodesaki stand

160
00:09:48,767 --> 00:09:51,067
and wait here with the door open?

161
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:52,067
-Yes. -Yes.

162
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,067
What is it? That package?

163
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:05,167
It's a package with return gifts from a funeral

164
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:07,167
that I attended the other day.

165
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:12,267
And? What's the proof that you were here till just a while ago?

166
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:16,595
See, the TV is on.

167
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:20,267
Well, I don't think that it will be enough to...

168
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:23,367
How about this?

169
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:26,605
There's still this much beer foam left here.

170
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:28,167
It's because I was drinking beer

171
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:29,967
and watching TV till just a while ago.

172
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:31,667
I see.

173
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:34,967
Proof that I was in this room till a while ago.

174
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,367
I wonder if I can find something.

175
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:42,621
You went to the same funeral as Mr. Ogino too, didn't you?

176
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:46,625
Yes. All three of us went.

177
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,627
The president didn't come though.

178
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:51,267
This coffee?

179
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:55,867
That's the coffee I was drinking before I left the room.

180
00:10:55,867 --> 00:10:58,967
I can't start my day without my morning coffee.

181
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:02,067
Then, this will for the time being, serve as proof.

182
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:04,643
There still some steam rising from it too.

183
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:08,367
Officer, hurry, hurry!

184
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,967
Hurry and look officer!

185
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:11,767
Please calm down.

186
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:15,067
After I heard about the steam of Ms. Tsukihara's coffee a while ago,

187
00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:16,667
I happened to remember.

188
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,867
No good. They're all snuffed out.

189
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:25,367
I left the cigarette standing in the ashtray when I left the room,

190
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:28,967
so I thought it'd still be lit, but...

191
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:30,467
Please look, see.

192
00:11:30,467 --> 00:11:32,671
The smoke's still rising, isn't it?

193
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:35,367
This is proof that I was here till just a while ago.

194
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:37,167
True.

195
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:42,067
Which means that none of you three went to the president's room?

196
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:43,067
No.

197
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:44,467
Of course not.

198
00:11:44,467 --> 00:11:46,967
We've been saying so all this time, haven't we?

199
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:50,167
The things that will serve as proof of the alibis are...

200
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:54,467
foam, steam, and smoke.

201
00:12:02,282 --> 00:12:05,282
Foam, steam, and smoke?

202
00:12:05,282 --> 00:12:07,082
Are you telling me that such intangible things

203
00:12:07,082 --> 00:12:08,707
are going to serve as alibis?

204
00:12:08,882 --> 00:12:10,082
Oh, yes.

205
00:12:10,082 --> 00:12:12,382
Please let me explain it to you in chronological order.

206
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:15,782
At about 07:30 am, when I changed shifts staking out

207
00:12:15,782 --> 00:12:17,682
and was on my way back to the station,

208
00:12:17,682 --> 00:12:20,382
I heard somebody shout, "A man fell!",

209
00:12:20,382 --> 00:12:22,721
and came running up to this condo.

210
00:12:22,882 --> 00:12:25,882
Then, I see a man dressed in PJs and a gown on the ground.

211
00:12:25,882 --> 00:12:27,582
From the testimony of the eye-witness,

212
00:12:27,582 --> 00:12:31,982
I found that the man had fallen from the top floor of the condo.

213
00:12:31,982 --> 00:12:34,733
A cell phone was in the pocket of the man so,

214
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:35,982
I checked it

215
00:12:35,982 --> 00:12:38,737
and found that at 07:25 am, just before he fell,

216
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:41,982
he simultaneously sent several people text mail.

217
00:12:41,982 --> 00:12:44,743
Then, when I tried re-sending the mail...

218
00:12:47,882 --> 00:12:49,182
I see.

219
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:53,682
So, these three received a provoking mail

220
00:12:53,682 --> 00:12:56,182
as if to encourage committing the murder.

221
00:12:56,182 --> 00:12:57,382
Yes.

222
00:12:57,382 --> 00:12:58,757
We found that the man who fell,

223
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:01,582
was company president Mr. Daisaku Katsumoto,

224
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:04,282
who worked with the three.

225
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:06,482
Since the contents of the mail were as such,

226
00:13:06,482 --> 00:13:08,767
I was going to ask the three to come voluntarily

227
00:13:08,982 --> 00:13:12,182
to the station for interrogation,

228
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:13,782
but, after the suggestion that going to their room right away

229
00:13:13,782 --> 00:13:15,582
may show evidence of them having been in the room

230
00:13:15,582 --> 00:13:17,882
till just before the incident.

231
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:20,082
You went to the rooms of the three

232
00:13:20,082 --> 00:13:21,582
and were shown the foam of the beer,

233
00:13:21,582 --> 00:13:23,782
the steam in the coffee cup

234
00:13:23,782 --> 00:13:25,282
and the smoke from the cigarette,

235
00:13:25,282 --> 00:13:27,082
is that the story?

236
00:13:27,082 --> 00:13:28,582
Yes, sir.

237
00:13:28,582 --> 00:13:30,789
If one of the three were the culprit that pushed...

238
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:33,882
President Katsumoto from the condo,

239
00:13:33,882 --> 00:13:36,482
and that person was mixed among the spectators

240
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,582
that person would've come here right away

241
00:13:38,582 --> 00:13:40,799
without going anywhere else.

242
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,382
After all, the sooner that person's witnessed here, the better,

243
00:13:44,382 --> 00:13:46,582
because when questioned later,

244
00:13:46,582 --> 00:13:48,807
the person can insist that he heard the commotion

245
00:13:48,982 --> 00:13:50,282
and rushed down here right away.

246
00:13:50,282 --> 00:13:53,082
But as for the foam, steam, and smoke,

247
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,813
you're the only one who saw them, right?

248
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:56,815
I took a picture of them too.

249
00:13:57,682 --> 00:14:00,482
I took it with my cell phone camera, though.

250
00:14:00,482 --> 00:14:02,282
Conan?

251
00:14:02,282 --> 00:14:04,382
I coincidentally happened to run into Conan

252
00:14:04,382 --> 00:14:06,582
and the others on the street in their car,

253
00:14:06,582 --> 00:14:10,829
when I heard the voice shouting that somebody fell.

254
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:14,382
And, you mean you took Conan

255
00:14:14,382 --> 00:14:16,835
to the room of someone who could possibly be a murderer?

256
00:14:17,082 --> 00:14:20,839
Yes, because Conan's the one who said

257
00:14:21,082 --> 00:14:22,382
that we should immediately go to the rooms.

258
00:14:22,382 --> 00:14:23,982
But...

259
00:14:23,982 --> 00:14:26,082
See, look.

260
00:14:26,082 --> 00:14:28,847
This is Mr. Ogino's beer foam.

261
00:14:29,082 --> 00:14:31,882
This is the steam from Ms. Tsukihara's coffee cup.

262
00:14:31,882 --> 00:14:34,853
Since it's hard to see in a photo, I took a video of this one only.

263
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:38,857
And, this is the smoke from Mr. Sodesaki's cigarette.

264
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:41,582
To make it easy to tell who's room it was,

265
00:14:41,582 --> 00:14:42,882
I had each resident of the room hold the thing up

266
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,382
before taking the picture.

267
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:45,782
Where were the two remaining people

268
00:14:45,782 --> 00:14:47,182
when the picture was being taken?

269
00:14:47,182 --> 00:14:50,182
I had them wait right outside the entrance with the door open.

270
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:54,873
Therefore, they didn't have time to go back to their rooms

271
00:14:54,873 --> 00:14:57,182
and change anything.

272
00:14:58,182 --> 00:15:01,582
And? Are you sure that President Katsumoto fell off

273
00:15:01,582 --> 00:15:06,682
from the veranda of his room that's on the 26th floor of this condo?

274
00:15:06,682 --> 00:15:07,782
Yes, sir.

275
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:11,882
The front door as well as the veranda window were left opened.

276
00:15:11,882 --> 00:15:14,082
Right after the president sent the mail in question out,

277
00:15:14,082 --> 00:15:18,082
he seems to have called the renovators too.

278
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:20,482
-Renovators? -Yes, sir

279
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:21,682
It seems that the carpet

280
00:15:21,682 --> 00:15:23,882
that the president ordered and was installed last night,

281
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:26,682
was not what he ordered.

282
00:15:26,682 --> 00:15:30,909
It seems that he actually measured the fluffiness of the carpet

283
00:15:31,082 --> 00:15:33,682
while on the phone and complained.

284
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,182
While he was on the phone,

285
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:37,682
the door bell seems to have rung,

286
00:15:37,682 --> 00:15:39,582
and he hung up saying that he would call back later.

287
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:45,182
President Katsumoto was in his room until right before he fell

288
00:15:45,182 --> 00:15:47,882
and it seems safe to say that the person who came to visit him

289
00:15:47,882 --> 00:15:49,582
is the culprit.

290
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:52,282
By the way, how long does it take

291
00:15:52,282 --> 00:15:54,933
to get from their room to the president's?

292
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:57,582
Since all three of them live on the 3rd floor,

293
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:00,939
to get to the president's room that is 23 floors above,

294
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:04,182
it would take about 7 minutes to go and come back.

295
00:16:04,182 --> 00:16:07,482
I actually used the stairs and tried it out myself,

296
00:16:07,482 --> 00:16:08,947
so there's no mistake about it.

297
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:10,582
You used the stairs?

298
00:16:10,582 --> 00:16:12,951
You didn't use the elevator?

299
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:15,882
There's a surveillance camera in the elevator,

300
00:16:15,882 --> 00:16:18,682
and when I had them show me the image on the camera in the control room,

301
00:16:18,682 --> 00:16:22,282
at the time President Katsumoto fell, around 07:30 am,

302
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:24,963
the images of the three weren't found.

303
00:16:25,182 --> 00:16:28,482
Therefore, if one of them is the culprit,

304
00:16:28,482 --> 00:16:31,682
I thought they took the stairs that had no camera.

305
00:16:31,682 --> 00:16:32,982
I see.

306
00:16:32,982 --> 00:16:35,582
The culprit rang the door bell of the president's room,

307
00:16:35,582 --> 00:16:38,977
and after being invited in, pushed him off.

308
00:16:39,182 --> 00:16:41,982
If you calculate the time it would take to get out of the room

309
00:16:41,982 --> 00:16:42,982
and run to the first floor,

310
00:16:42,982 --> 00:16:44,983
and you add the time it took you to enter

311
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:46,582
the rooms of the three after the incident...

312
00:16:46,582 --> 00:16:49,382
If anyone among the three is the culprit,

313
00:16:49,382 --> 00:16:51,782
it would mean that the person would've had to leave his room empty

314
00:16:51,782 --> 00:16:52,991
for more than 10 minutes.

315
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,082
Yes, sir.

316
00:16:54,082 --> 00:16:55,382
If left behind for that long,

317
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:58,997
I figured that the foam, steam, and smoke would've been long gone.

318
00:16:59,182 --> 00:17:00,982
I see.

319
00:17:00,982 --> 00:17:05,003
But why did the president send you all a mail like that?

320
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:06,282
Because of the lawsuit.

321
00:17:06,282 --> 00:17:09,982
All three of us were planning to sue that president.

322
00:17:09,982 --> 00:17:12,182
At the beginning of next month.

323
00:17:12,182 --> 00:17:13,382
Sue?

324
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:15,013
You know about it, don't you?

325
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:18,282
The incident about the popular actress who jumped to her death last week.

326
00:17:18,282 --> 00:17:22,082
Yes. If I remember correctly, she committed suicide

327
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,982
because her kiss scene with her "dangerous" lover

328
00:17:23,982 --> 00:17:26,682
made the headlines, right?

329
00:17:26,682 --> 00:17:29,027
I'm the one who took the picture.

330
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:31,482
I'm the one who wrote the article.

331
00:17:31,482 --> 00:17:35,033
And, I'm supposedly the one who edited it

332
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:37,482
and put it in the Weekly Magazine Great.

333
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:38,682
Supposedly?

334
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:42,582
Yes. Because the picture as well as the article are lies.

335
00:17:44,582 --> 00:17:48,682
That picture was taken right before they hugged each other.

336
00:17:48,682 --> 00:17:50,782
They weren't kissing or anything.

337
00:17:50,782 --> 00:17:52,782
The background of her boyfriend in the photo,

338
00:17:52,782 --> 00:17:54,782
that's written in the article, is full of baloney.

339
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,682
He happens to be a stunt man,

340
00:17:56,682 --> 00:17:58,582
and the wound on his face is one that he got

341
00:17:58,582 --> 00:17:59,782
from shooting a film that day.

342
00:17:59,782 --> 00:18:04,282
But, she was engaged with a young Diet member, wasn't she?

343
00:18:04,282 --> 00:18:06,382
In spite of that, if she was in somebody else's arms,

344
00:18:06,382 --> 00:18:08,782
it's not all baloney, is it?

345
00:18:08,782 --> 00:18:10,782
That's wrong too.

346
00:18:10,782 --> 00:18:13,071
He was her half younger brother, from her father's side,

347
00:18:13,282 --> 00:18:17,075
and was only hugging him telling him that she was getting married.

348
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:19,077
But, why, then?

349
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:21,582
We found all this out before we put it on the magazine

350
00:18:21,582 --> 00:18:23,582
and was going to trash it.

351
00:18:23,582 --> 00:18:26,282
But, that President Katsumoto re-wrote it without permission,

352
00:18:26,282 --> 00:18:27,682
and put it in the magazine.

353
00:18:27,682 --> 00:18:28,882
He wrote up a headline,

354
00:18:28,882 --> 00:18:30,782
"Popular Actress, Plays Dangerous Love Till Late

355
00:18:30,782 --> 00:18:32,882
on the Night Before her Wedding"!

356
00:18:32,882 --> 00:18:35,482
Since the day that magazine was to go out on the market,

357
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:39,582
was the day before her coming wedding with the groom-to-be Diet member,

358
00:18:39,582 --> 00:18:41,582
the magazine sold fast, but...

359
00:18:41,582 --> 00:18:46,382
Her younger brother was attacked by a fanatic fan of hers

360
00:18:46,382 --> 00:18:49,482
and is in the hospital even now, unconscious and in critical condition.

361
00:18:49,482 --> 00:18:51,582
Her marriage, most naturally shattered to pieces,

362
00:18:51,582 --> 00:18:55,582
and losing all hope, she chose suicide as a way out.

363
00:18:57,282 --> 00:18:59,982
But, if she told him the truth right away,

364
00:18:59,982 --> 00:19:02,082
it would've become obvious that everything was a lie, no?

365
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:03,982
She couldn't come out and tell him

366
00:19:03,982 --> 00:19:08,282
because her younger brother was the child of her father's mistress.

367
00:19:08,282 --> 00:19:11,129
But, I'm sure that the president wrote the article

368
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:12,782
because he saw through everything.

369
00:19:12,782 --> 00:19:14,582
But, it's totally unforgivable for him

370
00:19:14,582 --> 00:19:18,882
to use our names without permission and make up an article.

371
00:19:18,882 --> 00:19:24,382
That's why all three of us sent that guy our signed mail last night.

372
00:19:24,382 --> 00:19:26,282
We wrote that we had proof that he made that article up,

373
00:19:26,282 --> 00:19:29,147
so to be ready to take the consequences.

374
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:33,151
That we would keep on filing action against him until he's no more.

375
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:34,682
I see.

376
00:19:34,682 --> 00:19:37,155
So the president saw that mail this morning

377
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:40,182
and sent you all the mail that he did.

378
00:19:40,182 --> 00:19:45,163
Then, the funeral package that was found in the rooms of you three was...

379
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:46,082
Yes.

380
00:19:46,082 --> 00:19:48,782
It's the return gift that we received

381
00:19:48,782 --> 00:19:50,082
after attending that actress's funeral.

382
00:19:50,082 --> 00:19:53,171
Well, but we all kept our names hidden

383
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:54,682
and attended her funeral under the pretense

384
00:19:54,682 --> 00:19:57,982
of being people who were involved with her production company

385
00:19:57,982 --> 00:19:59,982
If that article is the motive,

386
00:19:59,982 --> 00:20:02,082
shouldn't we include the bereaved family of the deceased actress

387
00:20:02,082 --> 00:20:04,182
in the list of suspects too?

388
00:20:05,382 --> 00:20:09,882
But, the murder occurred right after the mail was sent.

389
00:20:09,882 --> 00:20:11,189
It doesn't seem right

390
00:20:11,382 --> 00:20:13,682
to take these three completely off the list of suspects.

391
00:20:13,682 --> 00:20:15,193
That's true.

392
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:18,382
The timing is too good for it to be a coincidence.

393
00:20:18,382 --> 00:20:20,582
But the foam, steam, and smoke are proof

394
00:20:20,582 --> 00:20:23,782
that they didn't do it.

395
00:20:23,782 --> 00:20:26,882
I thought that we would find something

396
00:20:26,882 --> 00:20:30,482
if we entered the room before any trick could be set up but...

397
00:20:30,482 --> 00:20:32,382
Or is there a way?

398
00:20:32,382 --> 00:20:34,882
A method, to set something up on the spot.

399
00:20:38,182 --> 00:20:39,582
Yes, hello.

400
00:20:39,582 --> 00:20:41,219
Conan?

401
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:43,782
About when do you think you'll be arriving here?

402
00:20:43,782 --> 00:20:46,582
We've started skiing already.

403
00:20:46,582 --> 00:20:48,882
Call us when you get here, okay?

404
00:20:48,882 --> 00:20:50,582
We'll be waiting for you, okay!

405
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,582
Sorry.

406
00:20:51,582 --> 00:20:53,582
I got caught up in a case here,

407
00:20:53,582 --> 00:20:55,233
so I don't think I'll be able to go there.

408
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:57,235
What? No joke!

409
00:20:57,235 --> 00:21:00,182
Conan says he can't come because of a criminal case.

410
00:21:00,182 --> 00:21:02,382
You mean Ai can't either?

411
00:21:02,382 --> 00:21:03,682
I guess not.

412
00:21:03,682 --> 00:21:05,882
Why don't you just let somebody else handle the case?

413
00:21:05,882 --> 00:21:09,582
All our breaths are super white here, and it feels really good.

414
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:11,982
Breath is white?

415
00:21:11,982 --> 00:21:14,582
Sorry. I'll call you again later.

416
00:21:14,582 --> 00:21:16,282
Conan?

417
00:21:16,282 --> 00:21:17,255
He hung up.

418
00:21:17,482 --> 00:21:19,782
Inspector Megure.

419
00:21:19,782 --> 00:21:23,261
Why don't we experiment while we're at it?

420
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:24,782
Experiment?

421
00:21:24,782 --> 00:21:28,582
Yes, an experiment with foam, steam, and smoke.

422
00:22:53,682 --> 00:22:56,182
So...

423
00:22:56,182 --> 00:22:58,982
I wonder what he's planning to do now?

424
00:22:58,982 --> 00:23:00,082
What about?

425
00:23:00,082 --> 00:23:01,782
Skiing.

426
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:04,082
Aren't Dr. Agasa and the others waiting?

427
00:23:05,363 --> 00:23:06,882
He's probably going to cancel going.

428
00:23:06,882 --> 00:23:09,367
The phone call that he got a while ago

429
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:10,682
was probably from the children.

430
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:13,371
He probably said something like,

431
00:23:13,371 --> 00:23:14,982
"I can't go because of a criminal case",

432
00:23:14,982 --> 00:23:16,682
or something to that effect, and cancelled.

433
00:23:16,682 --> 00:23:18,382
Like always.

434
00:23:18,382 --> 00:23:19,882
I see.

435
00:23:19,882 --> 00:23:21,682
That's too bad.

436
00:23:21,682 --> 00:23:24,482
So, you can go on home if you want to already.

437
00:23:24,482 --> 00:23:26,882
You don't have to drive us anywhere anymore.

438
00:23:26,882 --> 00:23:30,682
No, I'm concerned how the case is coming along too.

439
00:23:30,682 --> 00:23:34,082
Besides, I couldn't possibly leave a fragile little lady all by herself

440
00:23:34,082 --> 00:23:35,393
and leave.

441
00:23:35,393 --> 00:23:39,397
Because a murderer may be hanging around somewhere too.

442
00:23:39,582 --> 00:23:41,882
You sure are an unreliable knight.

443
00:23:42,982 --> 00:23:45,082
You're a tough one, aren't you?

444
00:23:47,082 --> 00:23:50,682
I'll protect you over my dead body, princess.

445
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,440
Next Conan's Hint:

446
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,840
"Business Tool".

447
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,116
Should we call Mr. Mouri over to do the experiment?

448
00:24:08,116 --> 00:24:10,192
Remove him from being in charge of beer.

449
00:24:10,192 --> 00:24:11,000
Yes.
