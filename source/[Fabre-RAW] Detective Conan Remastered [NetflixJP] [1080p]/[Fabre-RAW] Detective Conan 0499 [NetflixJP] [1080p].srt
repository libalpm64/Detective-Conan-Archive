1
00:00:02,231 --> 00:00:05,985
The Black Organization that shrunk my body.

2
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:07,231
After repeated attempts to grasp a chance

3
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:09,731
to disclose their identity,

4
00:00:09,731 --> 00:00:13,131
the FBI ends up on my side pursuing the same goal.

5
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:14,731
This time, we're taking repeated sink or swim risks

6
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:17,997
involving Rena Mizunashi.

7
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:22,931
The Black Organization that found out where she was hospitalized...

8
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:24,931
caused three different incidents to occur at the same time

9
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:28,007
in the vicinity of the hospital.

10
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:32,011
They also sent a bomb addressed to FBI agent James.

11
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:33,331
Furthermore, they went on to send bombs

12
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:34,531
under the pretense of get-well gifts

13
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:37,531
to a great number of patients at the hospital.

14
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:42,731
This plastic bomb alone is only capable of blowing up one room,

15
00:00:42,731 --> 00:00:45,631
but if several of these go off together...

16
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:51,031
This hospital will unmistakably collapse.

17
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:07,531
Sizzling hot suspense.

18
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:10,049
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

19
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:12,051
Serious tactics of outsmarting and counterplotting.

20
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:14,053
The hospital is in complete chaos.

21
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:15,331
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:17,031
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:17,031 --> 00:01:19,131
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

24
00:02:47,198 --> 00:02:52,151
"Red and Black Crash: Camouflage"

25
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:57,298
What's fortunate is that the bomb is set to go off at 5pm,

26
00:02:57,298 --> 00:02:59,198
giving us four more hours to go,

27
00:02:59,198 --> 00:03:02,161
and that if we remove the fuse that is poked into the bomb,

28
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:05,498
it won't function, thus, won't go off.

29
00:03:05,498 --> 00:03:10,169
In addition, almost all the packages have been delivered to hospital

30
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:13,298
and the total number amounted to almost 60.

31
00:03:13,298 --> 00:03:15,098
That's why the Organization over capacitated the hospital

32
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:18,177
with wounded and sick people?

33
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:21,198
If only one courier service delivered a whole lot of packages,

34
00:03:21,198 --> 00:03:22,698
they would be suspected.

35
00:03:22,698 --> 00:03:25,398
But if the packages are delivered by different couriers

36
00:03:25,398 --> 00:03:27,498
in this state of panic at the hospital,

37
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,598
nobody would really even bother to worry

38
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:31,898
whether the deliveries are suspicious or not.

39
00:03:31,898 --> 00:03:33,198
But, how did those guys at the Organization

40
00:03:33,198 --> 00:03:35,598
get the name of the patients?

41
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:37,098
From Kusuda.

42
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:38,197
He was taking pictures of the board

43
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:40,199
that indicated the names of the patients

44
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:43,098
and the corresponding room numbers in the nurse station,

45
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,598
so it's most likely that they wrote names of the people

46
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:47,398
that the gifts were addressed by using the picture that he sent them.

47
00:03:47,398 --> 00:03:50,798
Yes. At any rate, we've got four hours to go.

48
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:53,798
Dispatch all the agents, go to all the rooms

49
00:03:53,798 --> 00:03:55,398
and retrieve the bombs.

50
00:03:55,398 --> 00:03:56,598
Yes, sir...

51
00:03:57,898 --> 00:04:00,898
But, this is turning out way more difficult than we first figured.

52
00:04:00,898 --> 00:04:05,298
I thought they were only coming to retrieve Rena Mizunashi.

53
00:04:05,298 --> 00:04:06,798
Yes.

54
00:04:06,798 --> 00:04:09,598
I didn't think that they were going to go after her life

55
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,698
and try to shut her up on the spot to begin with.

56
00:04:13,698 --> 00:04:15,998
Agree, sonny?

57
00:04:15,998 --> 00:04:19,298
Right.

58
00:04:42,498 --> 00:04:45,098
I'm the security officer, may I come in?

59
00:04:46,265 --> 00:04:47,398
I'm checking for suspicious items.

60
00:04:47,398 --> 00:04:48,267
May I please ask for your cooperation?

61
00:04:54,698 --> 00:04:57,298
I wonder who this Mr. Kusuda is.

62
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,098
Excuse me.

63
00:05:01,098 --> 00:05:04,283
May I check the delivery that you received?

64
00:05:05,998 --> 00:05:08,287
It's this stuffed bear.

65
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:09,498
May I?

66
00:05:09,498 --> 00:05:10,698
Yes.

67
00:05:10,698 --> 00:05:11,998
I'm sorry, sonny,

68
00:05:11,998 --> 00:05:14,293
will you show me that bear, please?

69
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:15,898
Yeah, okay.

70
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,498
Thank you.

71
00:05:17,498 --> 00:05:18,698
I'll be done right away.

72
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:19,698
Okay.

73
00:05:23,898 --> 00:05:24,898
That...

74
00:05:24,898 --> 00:05:26,998
Oh, it's the lady that comes on TV!

75
00:05:35,998 --> 00:05:38,317
Rena Mizunashi?

76
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:41,698
It... it can't be? Why?

77
00:05:43,198 --> 00:05:45,498
I'm perfectly in good health now.

78
00:05:47,198 --> 00:05:49,298
To all you viewers out there,

79
00:05:49,298 --> 00:05:52,898
I'm really sorry to have worried you.

80
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,398
I thought she wasn't on TV recently.

81
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,398
Isn't that this hospital?

82
00:05:59,398 --> 00:06:01,098
No way.

83
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:03,698
Nice being back.

84
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:07,998
What? Rena Mizunashi is on TV?

85
00:06:07,998 --> 00:06:09,298
Is that true?

86
00:06:09,298 --> 00:06:10,798
Yes, sir!

87
00:06:10,798 --> 00:06:13,798
She's aired on the TVs in the hospital rooms and the lobby!

88
00:06:13,798 --> 00:06:15,298
It's being aired from her room in the hospital

89
00:06:15,298 --> 00:06:16,355
with her wearing a hospital gown,

90
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:18,998
saying my wounds have healed completely.

91
00:06:18,998 --> 00:06:22,698
Haven't you had any word from her room?

92
00:06:22,698 --> 00:06:24,098
No.

93
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:26,365
There are three agents guarding her room,

94
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:29,598
and one of them is to come out every five minutes

95
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,371
to report the circumstances to me.

96
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:35,198
You can't contact the room from your side, can you?

97
00:06:35,198 --> 00:06:37,798
No. The blood transfusion pump IV

98
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,379
has a tendency to malfunction from radio waves,

99
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:41,698
so I've ordered everyone to make sure

100
00:06:41,698 --> 00:06:45,498
to switch off their cell phones and wireless.

101
00:06:45,498 --> 00:06:47,698
At any rate, go to her room

102
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,598
and find out what's happening, will you?

103
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:51,498
Yes, sir! Everyone feels the same

104
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:53,198
and is headed for her room already.

105
00:06:54,898 --> 00:06:56,998
I see.

106
00:06:56,998 --> 00:06:59,798
So, that's what the Organization is after.

107
00:06:59,798 --> 00:07:02,098
Notify the agents of all the blocks!

108
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:04,198
Tell them not to go to Rena Mizunashi's room!

109
00:07:04,198 --> 00:07:05,298
What...

110
00:07:05,298 --> 00:07:07,898
It may be too late already, though.

111
00:07:07,898 --> 00:07:09,498
Too late...

112
00:07:09,498 --> 00:07:13,498
Don't tell me that the Organization already...

113
00:07:23,498 --> 00:07:24,998
Is something wrong?

114
00:07:24,998 --> 00:07:26,425
I came to check things out

115
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:28,798
because Rena Mizunashi was on TV.

116
00:07:28,798 --> 00:07:30,198
Didn't you see it?

117
00:07:30,198 --> 00:07:33,398
No, all the patients of the rooms that I went to,

118
00:07:33,398 --> 00:07:36,435
didn't have their TVs on.

119
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:39,898
Besides, all the members that were added to the group this time

120
00:07:39,898 --> 00:07:42,998
are still not informed of what room she's in.

121
00:07:42,998 --> 00:07:45,398
Would you like me to go too?

122
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:48,447
No, you go ahead and continue retrieving the bombs.

123
00:07:48,698 --> 00:07:51,398
There should be about ten minutes more left.

124
00:07:51,398 --> 00:07:53,698
Do your job right, okay?

125
00:07:53,698 --> 00:07:54,453
Roger.

126
00:07:56,455 --> 00:07:59,598
What... what on earth is going on?

127
00:08:00,798 --> 00:08:03,198
Hey! You!

128
00:08:03,198 --> 00:08:04,463
What on earth is going on?

129
00:08:08,898 --> 00:08:11,498
What the... she's here.

130
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:14,798
Then, what was that TV thing a while ago?

131
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:17,298
We were their puppets made to dance

132
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:21,898
on the palm of their hands just as they pleased.

133
00:08:21,898 --> 00:08:24,483
Puppets?

134
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:26,498
The TV image we saw a while ago was taken previously,

135
00:08:26,498 --> 00:08:30,198
after she got involved in the explosion accident and got hurt,

136
00:08:30,198 --> 00:08:32,491
and commented that she would be returning to the program.

137
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:34,198
To all you viewers out there,

138
00:08:34,198 --> 00:08:36,495
I'm sorry to have worried you.

139
00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:39,698
And after they doctored the clothing and background...

140
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:42,898
As you can see, my wounds have healed completely.

141
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:46,198
I saw the original video of it

142
00:08:46,198 --> 00:08:49,498
at the house of her biggest fan.

143
00:08:49,498 --> 00:08:52,511
But, why would the organization go out of their way

144
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:55,298
to hijack radio waves and air that image?

145
00:08:55,298 --> 00:08:58,517
To gather the members of the FBI here.

146
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:00,098
They saw through that nobody would be using cell phones

147
00:09:00,098 --> 00:09:02,521
or wireless in the hospital.

148
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:06,298
So, what now since they have us all gathered here?

149
00:09:06,298 --> 00:09:08,998
We were looking for them till just a while ago, right?

150
00:09:08,998 --> 00:09:10,529
What?

151
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:13,898
The toys that they delivered everywhere in this hospital.

152
00:09:13,898 --> 00:09:15,398
Where are they now?

153
00:09:15,398 --> 00:09:17,698
Oh, the bombs are in our pockets.

154
00:09:17,698 --> 00:09:19,798
With the fuse detached.

155
00:09:19,798 --> 00:09:21,598
Because we have to hurry to the next room

156
00:09:21,598 --> 00:09:23,998
after retrieving the bomb.

157
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:28,547
Don't tell me that...

158
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:34,553
Yeah, it was attached to that toy.

159
00:09:34,798 --> 00:09:36,898
A troublesome freebie.

160
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:46,565
They're like flies that gather around trash.

161
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:48,567
They're coming one after the other, aren't they, boss?

162
00:09:55,298 --> 00:09:59,198
That's room 307 on the forth floor, isn't it?

163
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,198
Yeah.

164
00:10:00,198 --> 00:10:01,898
Now that we have the room,

165
00:10:01,898 --> 00:10:05,098
it's our turn, Boss.

166
00:10:05,098 --> 00:10:07,098
From the beginning, the location of Kir's cage

167
00:10:07,098 --> 00:10:09,298
never interested me.

168
00:10:10,998 --> 00:10:14,998
Our point is to let them believe that we know where she is

169
00:10:14,998 --> 00:10:18,998
and drive a wedge of terror into their brains.

170
00:10:24,598 --> 00:10:27,198
All we have to do now is wait

171
00:10:27,198 --> 00:10:29,398
and see how the FBI that panics will fly.

172
00:10:29,398 --> 00:10:30,898
Communicator.

173
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:33,898
A communicator was rigged to the bombs.

174
00:10:33,898 --> 00:10:34,898
Yeah.

175
00:10:34,898 --> 00:10:38,617
In other words, everything that they did up to now

176
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:44,098
was done to figure out which room Rena Mizunashi was in.

177
00:10:44,098 --> 00:10:45,698
They made it look as if they were going to attack us

178
00:10:45,698 --> 00:10:48,627
with the first bomb they sent us.

179
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:51,398
They figured that we would panic at seeing the great number of bombs

180
00:10:51,398 --> 00:10:53,498
that were being delivered and run around to retrieve them,

181
00:10:53,498 --> 00:10:55,298
finally landing up here

182
00:10:55,298 --> 00:10:58,637
where the image of Rena Mizunashi was being aired.

183
00:10:58,637 --> 00:11:00,398
Then, you mean the Organization already...

184
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:03,298
They're probably working out their next move,

185
00:11:03,298 --> 00:11:05,698
watching us with grins on their faces.

186
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,998
So... what now?

187
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:19,098
Now that we know, we'd better get out of here fast.

188
00:11:19,098 --> 00:11:22,661
We will take the last resort that we talked of this morning.

189
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:24,398
We're splitting up in three different cars

190
00:11:24,398 --> 00:11:26,098
and going to confuse the Organization

191
00:11:26,098 --> 00:11:28,198
while we make it out of this hospital.

192
00:11:28,198 --> 00:11:30,398
The mission of the decoy car

193
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,698
is the bait will draw them as far away as possible.

194
00:11:33,698 --> 00:11:37,998
Ask Jodie as to who will be riding which car.

195
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:39,798
Hey.

196
00:11:39,798 --> 00:11:43,398
Why don't we take her on the Beetle of a man that I know?

197
00:11:43,398 --> 00:11:44,683
Huh...

198
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:46,685
She can be placed lying down in the backseat.

199
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:48,298
And those bad people are probably thinking

200
00:11:48,298 --> 00:11:51,098
that she's going to be moved out on a car

201
00:11:51,098 --> 00:11:53,398
that's big enough to load a stretcher.

202
00:11:53,398 --> 00:11:55,498
This way, they'll never be able to tell that she's in the car.

203
00:11:55,498 --> 00:11:57,998
That may be true but...

204
00:11:57,998 --> 00:12:01,198
I'll go outside and call him.

205
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:03,198
I'm sure he'll come right over.

206
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:06,705
I can't let you do that, sonny,

207
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:09,398
not even for you.

208
00:12:09,398 --> 00:12:12,098
This is a job for the FBI.

209
00:12:14,498 --> 00:12:16,715
We can't get any more ordinary citizens involved,

210
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:18,298
not more than we already have.

211
00:12:18,298 --> 00:12:20,198
Oh, but...

212
00:12:21,998 --> 00:12:24,498
Leave the rest to us.

213
00:12:24,498 --> 00:12:25,898
Then first of all,

214
00:12:25,898 --> 00:12:28,727
find the communicator that is attached to all the bombs

215
00:12:28,898 --> 00:12:30,298
and smash it.

216
00:12:30,298 --> 00:12:32,731
No.

217
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:36,735
I'd like you to smash it after you hear me out.

218
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,737
What is it, Akai?

219
00:12:38,898 --> 00:12:40,398
It just dawned on me

220
00:12:40,398 --> 00:12:42,198
after hearing what the boy had to say.

221
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:44,743
An excellent plan to deceive them

222
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:48,098
and get Rena Mizunashi out of here.

223
00:12:48,098 --> 00:12:49,298
What...

224
00:12:49,298 --> 00:12:50,398
What is it?

225
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,110
That's true...

226
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,210
we may be able to deceive them that way.

227
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:13,110
Well, I hope so.

228
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,910
Thank you, Conan for your great hints.

229
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,775
Yep.

230
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,910
The problem is who's going to drive the car

231
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,110
that Rena Mizunashi is riding.

232
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,783
Right.

233
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:26,785
Assuming that if the Organization finds out,

234
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:28,510
the driver may have to face a predicament

235
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,310
in which he would have to shake them off.

236
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,210
The driver would have to be able to play off the cuff,

237
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,310
know this area quite well,

238
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:39,510
and last but not least posses above average driving technique.

239
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:43,510
That person would be none other than you, Akai.

240
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,805
No. I don't think I'm a good pick.

241
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:49,310
The first thing they'll check

242
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:53,110
is to see which car I'm in.

243
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,813
In that case...

244
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,817
If so, I'll go.

245
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,821
I guess there's no one else but me who can handle this situation?

246
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:06,825
Oh, you're Camel that did a good job getting rid of the bomb.

247
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,110
I think he's the right one as well.

248
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:26,110
Fear of death is worse than death itself...

249
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,310
As the saying goes, no fear.

250
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,849
I won't. Death is what I am always prepared for.

251
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:32,851
After all, I've got no family that will cry of sadness for me

252
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:35,610
even if I were to die in the first place.

253
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,610
Then please get ready on the double.

254
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,910
Roger.

255
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:44,510
I'm Andre Camel.

256
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,865
I just got a call from my wife.

257
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,869
Oh, excuse me...

258
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:52,871
Huh? What is it?

259
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:56,310
Oh nothing. Good luck.

260
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,810
Thank you.

261
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:07,510
What's with that look on your face?

262
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,610
It's inevitable that this plan will succeed.

263
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,893
Or is my guarantee not enough for you?

264
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:18,310
No. It's more than enough.

265
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,899
Okay, Camel.

266
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,310
We're counting on you.

267
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,210
Whether we succeed or not is on your shoulders.

268
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,310
Yes, I understand, sir.

269
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,907
In the event that you succeed,

270
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:30,909
let me buy you a drink.

271
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:33,210
Yes. I'll be looking forward to it.

272
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,610
Wait!

273
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,917
Well...

274
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:43,210
I don't think we can leave it all up to you.

275
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,610
Let me go instead, will you?

276
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:50,410
I've got the route in mind.

277
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,710
It doesn't matter to me,

278
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,933
but don't blame me if you're bawled out later.

279
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,810
Never mind that. I'd like you to answer two or three questions...

280
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,610
Car number one, all set to go.

281
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,310
Car number two, all set to go.

282
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,010
Car number three, all set to go.

283
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,977
Car number one, two, and three,

284
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:40,979
are all set to go!

285
00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:44,310
Okay. Carry on as planned.

286
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,610
Keep all communication circuits open

287
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,510
and let me know immediately if something comes up.

288
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,510
Roger...

289
00:16:56,995 --> 00:16:58,997
By the way, Camel.

290
00:16:58,997 --> 00:16:59,910
Yes?

291
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,001
Would you happen to know where Jodie is?

292
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:05,810
It seems she left saying that she was going to see you.

293
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:09,510
Yes, she came about ten minutes ago.

294
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,510
Something about she thought up a good plan

295
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,510
to back up my car.

296
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,013
She left with her car

297
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:17,510
after telling me not to worry.

298
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,410
Hey... she did so without telling me?

299
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,021
I'm sure she's worried too.

300
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:25,023
Because after all, I'm the target car

301
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:29,027
that Rena Mizunashi is riding in.

302
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,010
It's come...

303
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,310
A dark blue wagon.

304
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,110
A second one.

305
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,010
A third one.

306
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:41,039
It seems there are three all together.

307
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,043
Okay, Chianti, you keep your eyes on the first car.

308
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,310
Okay.

309
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,010
Korn, on the second.

310
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,610
Okay.

311
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,051
Vodka, you take care of the third.

312
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:55,053
Roger.

313
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,055
I'll stick around the vicinity of the hospital

314
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:59,057
and keep an eye on the FBI agents here.

315
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:02,410
It could be that all three are decoys too.

316
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,710
When you each get hold of your cars in target,

317
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,410
use that method and find out what's going on inside.

318
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:13,071
I'll decide which car we'll narrow it down to.

319
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:16,510
By the way, Boss, did you get contact?

320
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:21,079
No, I got nothing from them.

321
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:25,083
Well, it's a strategy to ensure that person's life.

322
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:29,087
I'm not counting on it, to begin with.

323
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,110
Camel, report your situation.

324
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:46,410
Yes, sir. There is no suspicious moves of this car being pursued.

325
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,610
No, not even one.

326
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,710
Gin, I'm pursuing the first car.

327
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,510
How does it look?

328
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,110
The side windows are smoke

329
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,119
and I can't see inside.

330
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,410
Strip them naked.

331
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,510
Okay.

332
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,910
Projection completed.

333
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,410
I'll send it over to you.

334
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:20,810
The figures confirmable by thermograph are...

335
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,710
Nine.

336
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,910
It more or less matches the position

337
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,145
of the communicators set on the bombs.

338
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:31,149
Can you see the figure of the person lying down in the backseat?

339
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:33,151
Isn't that Rena Mizunashi?

340
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:34,310
She's the only one that's not showing response

341
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,510
from the communicator, right?

342
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,157
I've taken the image too.

343
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,410
I'll send it over.

344
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:47,165
The second car that Korn is pursuing also shows nine silhouettes,

345
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,167
but there are no signs of communicators.

346
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,169
I took an image here too.

347
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:58,310
The silhouette of people in the car that Vodka's pursuing is just two.

348
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,910
It seems that the two have communicators too.

349
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,210
Come on, hurry up and make up your mind, Gin.

350
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,810
If you keep me in suspense too long,

351
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,910
the rifle on my back is going to get impatient

352
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,187
and go off on its own.

353
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,810
Well, either way...

354
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:14,310
I guess you can forget about the car that I'm pursuing.

355
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,510
Judging from the position of the communicator

356
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,510
and number of silhouetted figures, they're only two FBI agents.

357
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,010
Moreover, if they go on as is,

358
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,610
it'll take them right back to the hospital they came from.

359
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:25,210
This car's unmistakably a decoy.

360
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,610
Thanks for waiting, Gin.

361
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,510
I finally found him.

362
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:35,710
Shuichi Akai's...

363
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:39,217
Chevy.

364
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:42,210
It must've been tough, Bellmot.

365
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:45,010
It was an order directly from that person, wasn't it?

366
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,225
Well, sorry.

367
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,010
He foresaw beforehand that this would happen

368
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:53,231
and had his car parked in a parking lot one kilometer away.

369
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:55,810
And? What's Akai's position?

370
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:59,237
Right through Haido Park leading into Beika-cho.

371
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:03,241
The car nearest here is the second car that Korn is pursuing.

372
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,810
It's about 200 meters behind.

373
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,010
Then, it's the car that Korn's pursuing!

374
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,810
Because Akai's guarding it!

375
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:17,010
Platinum Blonde long hair.

376
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,010
It's Bellmot.

377
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,810
They've finally appeared.

378
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:38,010
Talk about burning the tires.

379
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,610
At that rate, he'll catch up with the second car

380
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,279
in less than a minute.

381
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:45,010
He's probably realized that Korn is pursuing him.

382
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,510
The second car's bingo.

383
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,287
I'm changing course and joining Korn.

384
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,210
I'll go over to Korn too.

385
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,310
Pursuing the decoy's not going to get me anywhere.

386
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:59,297
I'm going to shoot him when he comes.

387
00:21:59,297 --> 00:22:00,810
Hold it, Korn.

388
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,710
Go into a side street and change course.

389
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,510
Why? You mean you're scared of Akai,

390
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,305
so you're going to give Kir up?

391
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:10,810
No, the one that we've got to go after is...

392
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:14,010
The third car that Vodka is pursuing.

393
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,313
Kir is in there.

394
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,140
Next Conan's Hint:

395
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,423
Kir.

396
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,322
In the next episode, Kir's secret is revealed.

397
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:09,810
-What's it about? -Well...

398
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,440
Find out next week.
