1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,440
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,440
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,240
Today's episode features a nostalgic bonnet bus.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,140
It also carries the memory of an incident that happened many years ago.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,240
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,890
"The 10th Passenger (Part 1)"

9
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,590
It feels so good.

10
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,490
The air's so fresh.

11
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,490
This bus is like the ones in the old days.

12
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,590
I like it because it doesn't have a cooler.

13
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,590
Good grief. I don't understand why

14
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,090
anyone's actually want to ride in this rundown bus.

15
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,290
It's because it's old that gives it charm!

16
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,690
I've never ridden in one before,

17
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,390
that's why I'm enjoying it!

18
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,290
What do they call this type of bus again?

19
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,190
It's a bonnet bus!

20
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,690
There were a lot around until 30 years ago!

21
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,690
See.

22
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,490
The front's narrow, isn't it?

23
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,390
That's what makes it fun when we pass another bus on a curb.

24
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,090
You're absolutely right!

25
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,990
You sure know a lot, kid.

26
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,990
I read about it in a book.

27
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,290
This kid knows a lot of useless information!

28
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,490
"Takuro Yabe (32)" -You're wrong! It's not considered useless information!

29
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,390
Not to those of us that live in Kagekuwa Village.

30
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,490
The bonnet bus is a valuable tourist attraction!

31
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,090
I didn't mean it like that.

32
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,790
"Head of the Youth Association, Takuro Yabe" -My name is Takuro Yabe,

33
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,490
I'm from Kagekuwa Village.

34
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,890
Head of the youth association.

35
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:23,590
On behalf of the bonnet bus and Kagekuwa Village, I welcome you!

36
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,390
Ladies and gentlemen! Kagekuwa Village has nothing to offer

37
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,190
except all the nature around you!

38
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,190
Please enjoy yourselves to your heart's content!

39
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,190
He's very cheerful.

40
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,290
"Toko Natsume (25), Bus Guide"

41
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,890
Hey, Natsume. Guide the way.

42
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,590
Yes! I'm sorry.

43
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,690
Look at this huge rock, it must've fallen from up there.

44
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,290
Oh, my!

45
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,990
Is that really okay?

46
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,290
That was scary.

47
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,190
"Memorial Tower"

48
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,590
A memorial tower?

49
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,290
Hey!

50
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,190
The seat's open.

51
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,490
"Sokichi Okumura (60), Deputy Mayor" -Go away! That's my seat!

52
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,290
Your seat?

53
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,590
Does this bus have reserved seats?

54
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,890
Mr. Okumura, behave yourself!

55
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,190
Today is Sunday!

56
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,890
I know that!

57
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,990
We agreed at the village meeting that unless it was a weekday,

58
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,190
we would give up our seats to the tourists!

59
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:17,390
The village mayor and you and your group decided that for yourselves!

60
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,690
What do you mean?

61
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,990
Interesting! Force me to follow orders?

62
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,990
Go ahead, see if you can do it!

63
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,290
Get out of my seat...

64
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:33,190
This has been my seat for 40 years!

65
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,290
I'm terribly sorry about that, sir.

66
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,390
Please take another seat.

67
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,190
What's with this bus anyway?

68
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,290
It gets pretty crowded.

69
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,890
That's because to the locals,

70
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,490
this isn't just a tourist attraction,

71
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,790
it's how they get around.

72
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,890
What was that?

73
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,690
What's wrong, Mr. Okumura!

74
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,690
What happened?

75
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,590
What's going on?

76
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,890
It looks like someone got sick.

77
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,590
"Mamoru Kajita (35), Bus Driver" -I'll head to the hospital right now!

78
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,690
It's no use!

79
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,590
It can't be...

80
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,290
He's dead.

81
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:41,990
Someone probably poisoned the tea in this bottle!

82
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,190
Stay in your seats!

83
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,790
No one gets off this bus until the police arrive!

84
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,990
Why we have to do that?

85
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,790
Wait a minute! I don't think that's necessary.

86
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,490
I especially mean you, Mr. Yabe! If this is a case of murder,

87
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,490
you'd be our prime suspect since you and the victim had an argument

88
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,390
and your seat is directly behind his!

89
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,590
Murder? Who are you anyway?

90
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,690
My name is Kogoro Mouri, I'm a private detective!

91
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,890
Mouri? You mean the famous private detective!

92
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,290
That means this is a big case!

93
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,890
That's right! It must be!

94
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,890
I wonder who did it?

95
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,790
"Patrolman Hitoshi Shinkai (28)" -I'm at your service!

96
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,290
Patrolman Hitoshi Shinkai of the Kagekuwa station, reporting!

97
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,990
It will be an honour to work with the infamous private detective,

98
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,190
Kogoro Mouri!

99
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,690
You seem to be a very promising officer!

100
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,190
I'll be glad to be of service!

101
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,590
Thank you very much!

102
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:45,390
By the way, it seems you claimed this was a murder,

103
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,690
but are you sure?

104
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:50,790
If it is, then we have a serious situation on our hands.

105
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,190
Well, we've got to investigate it thoroughly first...

106
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,290
It's murder.

107
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,590
You again! Always sticking your nose in where it doesn't belong!

108
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,890
Look at the plastic bottle.

109
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,090
Plastic bottle?

110
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,390
You can see it's leaking.

111
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,690
I think it's from that tiny hole, it looks like a needle hole.

112
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,990
He's right!

113
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,590
Maybe they used a hypodermic needle to put the poison in?

114
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,190
All right! Let's search everyone!

115
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,490
Whoever has a hypodermic needle is our murderer!

116
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,890
I wouldn't know about that.

117
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,590
The windows were open

118
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,490
so it could've been tossed out at any time!

119
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,290
And besides, the killer could've gotten off at one of the other stops!

120
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,590
I feel a storm coming.

121
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,790
What?

122
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,790
No, it'll be bigger than a storm.

123
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,690
There's going to be a war in the village!

124
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,890
What?

125
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,990
War?

126
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,890
This is... This is terrible.

127
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,890
What'll we do?

128
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,890
A lot of blood's going to flow.

129
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,590
Blood will flow?

130
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,590
-What? -What on earth is happening?

131
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,990
It's scary.

132
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,090
Mr. Mouri, the hypodermic needle has been found!

133
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,090
It was on the side of the road where the bus passed!

134
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,090
There was some poison in it, but very little!

135
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,190
What about fingerprints?

136
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,490
Officer Shinkai!

137
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,990
Detective Hino.

138
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,590
"Shohei Hino (41), Detective" -You shouldn't be giving out information

139
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,790
without permission!

140
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,290
Which means, you didn't find any fingerprints, did you?

141
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,590
What?

142
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,590
If you did, you'd have taken our fingerprints

143
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:17,490
the minute you arrived, to compare them.

144
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,090
As a matter of fact, you're right.

145
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,990
Who are those people?

146
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,790
Sir, this is Mr. Kogoro Mouri, a very famous private detective!

147
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,390
He just happened to be on the bus.

148
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,190
With your permission, I, "Sleeping Kogoro",

149
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,390
will be happy to assist in the investigation...

150
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,890
That's ridiculous!

151
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,990
While you're sleeping,

152
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,790
I'll bet somebody else is solving the crime for you!

153
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,890
He's almost right.

154
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,890
Well, you can do your thing,

155
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,890
as long as you don't get in the way of our investigation.

156
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,990
What a rude fellow!

157
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,890
All right, let's do our thing!

158
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,890
I know you can solve the case

159
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,190
without those policemen's help.

160
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,690
You can bet on it!

161
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:03,390
Just watch, Detective Hino! I'll show you!

162
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:07,990
Mr. Mouri, I may not be much help but I'd be glad to assist.

163
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,490
You won't get away with this!

164
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,290
Committing a murder right under my nose like that!

165
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,290
I'm going to find the killer on my own!

166
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,390
Excuse me,

167
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,690
please wait here until the investigators get done with the questioning.

168
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,890
Of course, this is the only lodging there is in the village.

169
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,790
Officer Shinkai.

170
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,590
What do you mean we're the only lodging? That's quite rude.

171
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,590
Ms. Komai! That's not what I meant.

172
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,090
"Kinu Komai (42), Innkeeper" -I was just kidding.

173
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,890
Welcome to the Komai Inn.

174
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,690
It's a wonderful place. It has a lot of character.

175
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:42,590
Yes, I love wooden buildings! They're human friendly.

176
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,090
Thank you very much.

177
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,590
Besides, this place is neutral.

178
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,990
Neutral?

179
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,590
You're been babbling strange things

180
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:54,090
about storms and wars.

181
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,490
Well, you see...

182
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,090
You'll find out soon enough.

183
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,890
But for now, please follow me to your rooms.

184
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,490
You can see Mountain Fuji from this place.

185
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,790
This is great!

186
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,890
You're Conan, aren't you? Is that your room?

187
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,590
You're the bus guide!

188
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,990
You live next door.

189
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,190
Yes, because you get the best view of Mountain Fuji from around here.

190
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,290
Mr. Mouri! Big news!

191
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,790
-What happened? -I have big news!

192
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,790
The investigators are questioning Mr. Yabe.

193
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,790
I knew it, so he's the prime suspect after all!

194
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,790
I'm not sure about that yet,

195
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,990
I'm talking about where they're questioning him!

196
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,990
What do you mean?

197
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,490
They didn't take him to the district station,

198
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,790
they're doing it at the substation here!

199
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:44,790
And both the pro and con factions have stormed their way in.

200
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,490
Pro and con factions?

201
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,290
Everyone go home! The police will do a thorough investigation!

202
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,490
We don't trust them! Give us Yabe!

203
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,690
He killed the deputy mayor!

204
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,790
Yes, that's right!

205
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,590
That's not true! Yabe didn't do it!

206
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,990
He's innocent!

207
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,590
Mayor, you told Yabe to do it, didn't you? You won't get away with it!

208
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,790
Get him!

209
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:09,390
Stop that! I'll arrest you for interfering in police business!

210
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:12,890
What's going on?

211
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,490
Stop that! Everybody calm down!

212
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,090
Everybody, just calm down!

213
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,390
Move it!

214
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,590
-Uncle Mouri! -Dad!

215
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,590
Mr. Mouri, are you all right?

216
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,690
Please stop!

217
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:36,890
I said stop it!

218
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,080
Yes, the crowd's breaking up

219
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,080
and things are settling now again!

220
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,380
Yes! Thank you very much!

221
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,380
That should do it.

222
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,180
Mr. Mouri, the police car transporting Mr. Yabe

223
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,280
has arrived safely at the district station!

224
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,080
Never mind that, what's going on in this village?

225
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,980
Actually, nothing like this happened here until a year ago

226
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,780
but ever since it was decided at the village assembly that

227
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:14,280
the bonnet bus would be used to promote tourism,

228
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,180
the faction backing the development of tourism

229
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,280
headed by the mayor and Mr. Yabe

230
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,480
and the opposing faction led by the victim, Mr. Okumura,

231
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,480
the deputy mayor has been at each other's throats.

232
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,880
That bus had always been used by the villagers

233
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,980
as their mode of transportation.

234
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,680
It's a small village and everyone knows each other,

235
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,980
so naturally, they all started to have their own seats,

236
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,980
it was just the way things worked out.

237
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,580
But then it was decided that on weekends,

238
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,280
the seats would be for the tourists.

239
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,980
And Deputy Mayor Okumura and his opposing faction

240
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,480
didn't like the idea.

241
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,880
You're right and things got worse.

242
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,480
But, who would have thought it'd lead to murder?

243
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,780
Yabe is innocent!

244
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,580
I'm sorry about how I acted before,

245
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,480
I'm the mayor, Takehiko Funaki!

246
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,280
"Takehiko Funaki (48), Mayor" -I hear you're a famous private detective?

247
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,880
I'd like you to work for us!

248
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,780
I can assure you Takuro Yabe did not kill the deputy mayor!

249
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,880
I don't like to talk ill about the dead

250
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,680
but he had a lot of enemies!

251
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,680
Some in his opposing faction too!

252
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,680
Please find the real killer!

253
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,680
But it could turn out to be Mr. Yabe after all.

254
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,780
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it!

255
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:34,480
I just want things in the village back to normal as soon as possible!

256
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,480
Everyone was finally beginning to forget

257
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,980
that tragic incident seven years ago

258
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,980
and now this...

259
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,980
What incident seven years ago?

260
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,280
Nothing you should be concerned about!

261
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,480
By the way, how does a fee of one million yen sound to you?

262
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,880
One... one million?

263
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,480
I just want this case to be solved and things back to normal!

264
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,480
Well, I'll be counting on you!

265
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,380
All right! Let's start asking around!

266
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,980
Then I'll be your guide!

267
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,880
Excuse me.

268
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,880
Did the victim, Mr. Okumura always take the bus at that time?

269
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,280
Go away!

270
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,680
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

271
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,180
Excuse me, I'd like to...

272
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,880
Hey! What's going on in this village?

273
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,880
Actually, there're more villagers against the proposal!

274
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,080
And I guess everyone's heard

275
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,580
you're working for the mayor who's on the other side,

276
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,280
that's why...

277
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,780
Gosh! How can we find anything out?

278
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,080
Ran, you and Conan go back to the inn!

279
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,580
I'm going to try a little longer!

280
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,680
Don't wait for me at dinner!

281
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,380
I don't know what time I'll be back!

282
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,180
Officer!

283
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,780
What is it, Conan?

284
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:08,180
What happened in this village seven years ago?

285
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,880
You're curious about what Mayor Funaki said back there?

286
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,080
It was an accident, a bus accident!

287
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,180
A bus accident? Did it involve that bonnet bus?

288
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:20,180
Yes, we had it repaired.

289
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,980
What caused the accident?

290
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,980
Did anyone get hurt? Was anyone killed?

291
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,980
It happened seven years ago, before I got transferred here,

292
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,780
so I don't know all the details.

293
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,180
But I heard about two people died.

294
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,280
What does that have to do with anything?

295
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,780
Nothing! I was just curious!

296
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,680
Hey, Officer Shinkai! Come on!

297
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,380
Yes, sir! Right away!

298
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,480
The bus accident seven years ago,

299
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,680
Mayor Funaki's suspicious behaviour

300
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,580
and that huge fee,

301
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,580
something fishy is going on here.

302
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,380
Everything looks delicious!

303
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,280
I hope you like it.

304
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,980
It's a meal using edible wild plants.

305
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,780
Miss! Miss Bus Guide!

306
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,080
Conan, what're you doing?

307
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,280
Ms. Toko, are you home?

308
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,380
What is it, Conan?

309
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,880
There's something I want to ask you.

310
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,580
You shouldn't do that from here, it's rude!

311
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,880
I'm sorry.

312
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,580
It's all right. What do you want to know?

313
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,580
It's about the bus accident seven years ago.

314
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,880
I'm sorry, Conan.

315
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,980
I only came here to work 6 months ago.

316
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,780
I heard about the accident but I don't know much.

317
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,680
I see.

318
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,280
But since we pass the spot it happened every day,

319
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,580
I'm reminded of it.

320
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,580
It's the spot where the memorial tower is!

321
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,980
Oh, that place...

322
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,280
That scary part of the cliff.

323
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,380
I heard that two of the passengers were drinking and they started fighting,

324
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,880
that caused the bus to lose control and they went over the cliff.

325
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,480
I'm... I'm terribly sorry!

326
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,280
My hands slipped. I'll bring another right away.

327
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,580
Are you all right?

328
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,580
Yes, I'm fine.

329
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,580
Ms. Toko, is something wrong?

330
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,880
It's nothing.

331
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,180
Well, I've got to go and prepare dinner,

332
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,880
I'll see you later, Conan.

333
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,580
Good grief! I don't believe this!

334
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,080
It's not only the con faction!

335
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,480
Even the ones that agree with the mayor won't cooperate!

336
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,180
Dad, keep your voice down, other people will hear you.

337
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,580
Who cares? Besides, this is neutral territory!

338
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,980
Why won't they cooperate?

339
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,080
According to Officer Shinkai,

340
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,480
although they support tourism on the one hand,

341
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,680
the tourists leave their trash behind, they destroy nature

342
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,480
and they stay up late making a racket!

343
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,480
They're giving the villagers a pretty bad time!

344
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,580
No wonder they'll act like that.

345
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,580
Yes, but that won't help me do my job!

346
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,680
It's not going to be easy if we can't get any information.

347
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,280
Darn it all!

348
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,580
Dad? Are you in your case solving sleep mode?

349
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,180
Dad...

350
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,280
What?

351
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,280
He's just drunk and fell asleep.

352
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,180
I knew that!

353
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,780
Conan! Tell them to clear the table!

354
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,680
And tell them to lay out our bedding too!

355
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,680
Hurry!

356
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,680
Yes!

357
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,980
It's the innkeeper.

358
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,980
Where is she going at this time with those flowers?

359
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,480
Conan.

360
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,880
Good grief, where'd he goes now?

361
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,280
Conan's shoes are gone!

362
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,280
Did he go outside?

363
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,880
I'm sorry...

364
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,380
It's Ms. Toko.

365
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,680
What on earth is going on?

366
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,680
Conan, where are you?

367
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,080
Kagekuwa Shrine.

368
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,080
Would he come in here?

369
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,880
Hey, you! What are you doing?

370
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,680
What? Conan, is that you?

371
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,380
What are you doing out here?

372
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,680
It was just playing hide and seek.

373
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,180
Don't scare me like that.

374
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,980
Did something happen around here?

375
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,480
Mr. Yabe was released for lack of evidence

376
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,480
so I figured I should let Mr. Mouri know.

377
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,980
That was Mayor Funaki's voice!

378
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,980
Conan!

379
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,280
What are you doing?

380
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,660
Ran!

381
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,140
Next Conan's Hint:

382
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,420
"Bank passbook"

383
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,360
In the next episode, many questions are answered!

384
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,180
What does "The 10th Passenger" mean?

385
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,780
That'll be answered in the next episode too.
