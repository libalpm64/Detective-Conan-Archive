There is a saying that

the stork brings new life and good fortune to homes

3
00:00:09,033 --> 00:00:10,633
on which it stops to rest.

4
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:16,333
And the small storks we just encountered

5
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,833
are no exception.

6
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,833

and was founded by Douchi Shounin, 1400 years ago.

Located in Northern Hyogo Prefecture,

"Amanohashidate" -it's surrounded by many scenic locations

00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:36,512
such as the Amanohashidate,

21
00:02:36,512 --> 00:02:38,612
known as one of the "three representations of Japanese scenery".

22

Seeking the seven hot springs,

Matsuba crabs, and Taraba beef,

Hurry, hurry, you two!

This feels good!

28
00:02:57,312 --> 00:02:59,112
This must be the foot bath!

29
00:03:00,412 --> 00:03:02,161
This feels good!

30
00:03:02,412 --> 00:03:04,612
Awesome, the weather is great too!

31
00:03:04,612 --> 00:03:07,212
Can't wait to get to the open-air bath!

32
00:03:07,212 --> 00:03:09,612
I didn't think much of hot springs,

33
00:03:09,612 --> 00:03:11,412
but I think I'm starting to like it.

34
00:03:11,412 --> 00:03:13,012
Excuse me.

35
00:03:13,012 --> 00:03:15,812
Sorry! Can you move down just a bit?

36
00:03:15,812 --> 00:03:17,712
My, we have nerves. I feel bad about it!

37
00:03:17,712 --> 00:03:20,512
Pardon us!

38
00:03:20,512 --> 00:03:22,181
It's because you're too fat!

39
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:24,912
Look who's talking!

40
00:03:24,912 --> 00:03:27,812
As I suspected, it's not all that good.

41
00:03:27,812 --> 00:03:30,189
Let's go to all the spas, okay?

42
00:03:30,412 --> 00:03:33,412
I wonder where Genta and the others started from.

43
00:03:35,712 --> 00:03:37,512

"Mandara Spa" -How luxurious for us

45
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:40,199
to be at the hot springs from early morning.

46
00:03:40,412 --> 00:03:42,812
Indeed.

47
00:03:42,812 --> 00:03:45,512
I got Mandara Spa!

48
00:03:45,512 --> 00:03:48,612
Crab ice cream after the bath hits the spot.

Next, we're headed to Ichino Spa.

Genta!

51
00:03:52,512 --> 00:03:55,112
You're dripping ice cream on your badge!

52
00:03:55,112 --> 00:03:57,512
What a waste!

And here's the reason why.

56
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,227
This is the infamous Kouno Spa

Thanks, Uncle.

60

Does he think I'm a stork?

61
00:04:17,812 --> 00:04:18,912
Don't you worry!

62
00:04:18,912 --> 00:04:22,612
It was recommended by a client from a previous case that I solved!

63
00:04:24,512 --> 00:04:27,312
Actually, I solved that.

64
00:04:27,312 --> 00:04:30,712
Anyway, how did you sprain your ankle?

65
00:04:30,712 --> 00:04:32,612
Well...

I don't want to tell you about it!

73
00:04:58,612 --> 00:05:01,112
I bet you weren't paying attention to where you were going.

74
00:05:01,112 --> 00:05:03,012
Gotta pay, attention?

75
00:05:07,112 --> 00:05:09,012
What the heck are you doing?

76
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,112
Isn't that...

77
00:05:14,612 --> 00:05:16,295

94
00:05:56,912 --> 00:05:59,012
Wait, you two!

95
00:05:59,912 --> 00:06:03,012
Isn't this Ayumi's?

96
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:05,412
Ayumi!

97
00:06:05,412 --> 00:06:06,812
I guess I'll hold on to it!

98
00:06:11,512 --> 00:06:14,712
Let's see. Yanagi Spa is...

99

This way.

100

That hurt!

Are you all right?

102
00:06:29,812 --> 00:06:30,812
Are you hurt?

103
00:06:30,812 --> 00:06:33,112
Don't touch me!

Haruna.

You're name is Haruna?

Aren't you with your mom and dad?

108
00:06:47,312 --> 00:06:49,812
I'm not!

109
00:06:49,812 --> 00:06:51,812
Wait!

110
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:53,412
Haruna!

111
00:07:02,412 --> 00:07:05,112

"Goshono Spa" -But, are you sure...

113
00:07:06,612 --> 00:07:08,407
this will make publication?

114
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:09,612
Of course!

115
00:07:09,612 --> 00:07:11,812
I'm gonna be following you throughout the day!

116
00:07:11,812 --> 00:07:13,912
Well, have it your way then!

117
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:17,912
Beer is nice,

118
00:07:17,912 --> 00:07:20,419
but Japanese sake with hot water from the hot spring is exceptional!

119
00:07:20,612 --> 00:07:23,312
Great! Just keep at it!

120
00:07:23,312 --> 00:07:25,412
Well, this is how an infamous detective

121
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:27,112
should be spending his vacation!

122
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:29,112
I got Ichino Spa!

123
00:07:29,112 --> 00:07:32,431
-That's three. -Hey!

124
00:07:32,612 --> 00:07:35,212
Ta-da! I got crab sticks!

125
00:07:37,512 --> 00:07:39,312
I know you're just being your usual self,

126
00:07:39,312 --> 00:07:41,712
but how much more are you going to eat, Genta?

127
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,212
I still have to get to the horse-beef steak!

128
00:07:44,212 --> 00:07:45,212
Horse-beef?

129
00:07:45,212 --> 00:07:47,612
You know, both horse meat and beef.

130
00:07:47,612 --> 00:07:49,312
It's a local specialty.

131
00:07:49,312 --> 00:07:52,912
"Horse Beef" -You mean...

132
00:07:52,912 --> 00:07:56,012
-Tajima beef? -Huh?

133
00:07:56,012 --> 00:07:59,112
It doesn't mean you can shorten it just because you can't read it!

134
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:02,461
What? It's not a combination of horse and beef?

135
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:05,012
I thought I was getting a good deal.

136
00:08:05,012 --> 00:08:08,812
Genta ate a whole bunch for breakfast.

137
00:08:08,812 --> 00:08:10,469
Huh? Where's Sister Ran?

138
00:08:10,712 --> 00:08:14,212
Well... We've lost her a while ago.

139
00:08:14,212 --> 00:08:15,912
Where could she be?

140
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,112
I just saw Sister Ran!

141
00:08:18,112 --> 00:08:22,012
-Really? -Yes, I recall it was by the Yanagi Spa.

142
00:08:22,012 --> 00:08:24,483
See.

143
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,912
The person in this photo is Ran, right?

144
00:08:27,912 --> 00:08:30,512
Who is that girl in the photo with her?

145
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:34,493
Mitsuhiko, let me take a look at the left.

146
00:08:34,712 --> 00:08:37,512
-Like this? -Yes.

147
00:08:37,512 --> 00:08:39,312
This guy is...

148
00:08:39,312 --> 00:08:40,812
This man...

149
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,312
-This guy ticked me off! -What?

150
00:08:43,312 --> 00:08:46,505
He's the guy that bumped into Genta and didn't apologize!

151
00:08:50,812 --> 00:08:52,112
Genta!

152
00:08:52,112 --> 00:08:54,513
What the heck is his problem?

153
00:08:56,512 --> 00:08:59,112
My crab ice cream!

154
00:08:59,112 --> 00:09:01,112
That was only my second one!

155
00:09:01,112 --> 00:09:04,523
Is that man following Ran and the girl?

156
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:06,912
Gotta call Sister Ran regardless.

157
00:09:08,712 --> 00:09:10,512
The phone you are trying to reach

158
00:09:10,512 --> 00:09:14,533
is either out of the service area or turned off and...

159
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:16,112
What's up, what's up?

160
00:09:16,112 --> 00:09:18,537
Are you guys talking about lunch?

161
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:21,812
-Sister Ran disappeared. -What?

162
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,812
She's not answering her phone either!

163
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:25,412
What's going on?

164
00:09:25,412 --> 00:09:27,212
Things are getting interesting!

165
00:09:27,212 --> 00:09:29,712
Hey, the close-up is over!

166
00:09:29,712 --> 00:09:31,512
What?

167
00:09:31,512 --> 00:09:34,112
But I've already informed the editor!

168
00:09:34,112 --> 00:09:36,112
My daughter is missing.

169
00:09:36,112 --> 00:09:37,912
I'm sorry, but this is it.

170
00:09:37,912 --> 00:09:41,012
-Can't you do something about it? -Don't be so pushy!

171
00:09:41,012 --> 00:09:43,312
There goes my chance to make a breakthrough.

172
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:45,212
Darn it!

173
00:09:45,212 --> 00:09:47,512
So, don't we have any clues

174
00:09:47,512 --> 00:09:49,512
that'll leads us to Ran's whereabouts?

175
00:09:49,512 --> 00:09:50,912
Well...

176
00:09:50,912 --> 00:09:54,573
If I only knew who that girl is...

177
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:58,312
What's wrong? Walking on crutches...

178
00:09:58,312 --> 00:10:00,579
Did you fall down and twist your ankle?

179
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:01,812
Hattori!

180
00:10:01,812 --> 00:10:03,712
I mean, Brother Heiji?

181
00:10:03,712 --> 00:10:06,012
What a coincidence to see you here.

182
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:07,912
Where's Ran?

183
00:10:07,912 --> 00:10:10,312
Ran disappeared!

184
00:10:10,312 --> 00:10:11,912
-What? -Disappeared?

185
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:16,112
Yes, she is supposedly with this girl.

186
00:10:16,112 --> 00:10:17,412
Girl?

187
00:10:17,412 --> 00:10:19,612
Wait a minute! This girl...

188
00:10:19,612 --> 00:10:21,712
You know her?

189
00:10:21,712 --> 00:10:23,712
Sure I know her.

190
00:10:23,712 --> 00:10:27,512
We're here to find that kid.

191
00:10:27,512 --> 00:10:30,012
Haruna Tabuse, 8 years old.

192
00:10:30,012 --> 00:10:33,412
The only daughter of the president of a famous restaurant franchise.

193
00:10:33,412 --> 00:10:35,412
She's been missing since yesterday.

194
00:10:35,412 --> 00:10:37,812
-What? -Missing?

195
00:10:39,512 --> 00:10:40,912
Mr. Tabuse!

196
00:10:40,912 --> 00:10:43,112
Sorry to keep you waiting.

197
00:10:43,112 --> 00:10:44,112
Hattori!

198
00:10:44,112 --> 00:10:45,312
"Shuhei Tabuse (42)" -Where's Haruna?

199
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,512
Did you find my daughter Haruna?

200
00:10:47,512 --> 00:10:51,412
Not yet, but we have a solid clue.

201
00:10:51,412 --> 00:10:53,312
Really?

202
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:56,012
By the way, who's this?

203
00:10:56,012 --> 00:10:58,112
He's a detective from Tokyo.

204
00:10:58,112 --> 00:11:00,012
I'm Kogoro Mouri.

205
00:11:00,012 --> 00:11:01,912
Mouri... The...

206
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,312
The infamous detective?

207
00:11:04,312 --> 00:11:06,212
Huh?

208
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:08,212
What is that stain?

209
00:11:08,212 --> 00:11:10,649
And this little one is...

210
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:12,651
I'm Conan Edogawa!

211
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:14,312
"Little" was so unnecessary.

212
00:11:15,312 --> 00:11:17,712
Man, why are you following us?

213
00:11:17,712 --> 00:11:19,312
Stay out of this, little brat!

214
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:22,412
Well, I'm worried about Sister Ran!

215
00:11:22,412 --> 00:11:24,012
Sister Ran?

216
00:11:24,012 --> 00:11:30,012
Actually, it looks like your daughter is with our daughter Ran.

217
00:11:30,012 --> 00:11:32,671
Your daughter kidnapped Haruna?

218
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:34,412
Say something!

219
00:11:34,412 --> 00:11:36,112
Now, now...

220
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,312
"Kinosaki Base Spring"

221
00:11:37,312 --> 00:11:40,012
Meat bun made from Tajima beef.

222
00:11:43,812 --> 00:11:45,312
So good!

223
00:11:45,312 --> 00:11:49,012
The Tajima meat bun is tasty!

224
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:50,689
This crab bun looks delicious, too!

225
00:11:50,912 --> 00:11:54,693
Hey! Stop! I'm not your wallet!

226
00:11:54,912 --> 00:11:58,697
Come on, treat me a bit.

227
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:00,312
By a "bit", you mean

228
00:12:00,312 --> 00:12:02,701
ten hot spring eggs, five pork buns,

229
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:04,012
and four beef buns?

230
00:12:04,012 --> 00:12:07,612
That's not fair! Conan took off without us.

231
00:12:07,612 --> 00:12:11,712
I guess something really happened to Ran?

232
00:12:11,712 --> 00:12:15,512
At least Edogawa seems to think so.

233
00:12:15,512 --> 00:12:20,112
Then, let's find Sister Ran before Conan does!

234
00:12:20,112 --> 00:12:23,412
I agree! That's the way the Youth Detectives roll!

235
00:12:23,412 --> 00:12:25,912
There wouldn't be a problem if we can do that.

236
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:29,112
Our only clue is that photo.

237
00:12:29,112 --> 00:12:31,212
Right.

238
00:12:31,212 --> 00:12:33,112
This backpack!

239
00:12:33,112 --> 00:12:36,112
It's the same one that I wanted!

240
00:12:36,112 --> 00:12:37,812
The same?

241
00:12:37,812 --> 00:12:40,739
See, on this brochure...

242
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:42,512
Isn't this the backpack?

243
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:47,212
I'm so sorry. I lost my temper.

244
00:12:47,212 --> 00:12:50,112
Please, don't worry about it.

245
00:12:50,112 --> 00:12:52,751
Mr. Tabuse. If it's okay with you,

246
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:55,012
can you tell us what happened from the beginning?

247
00:12:55,012 --> 00:12:56,512
Sure.

248
00:12:56,512 --> 00:12:59,412
It all started yesterday.

249
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,512
An exhibition piece was stolen yesterday

250
00:13:01,512 --> 00:13:04,763
from the Tabuse Museum in Kobe.

251
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:09,212
It happened while we were rearranging the exhibition.

252
00:13:09,212 --> 00:13:11,112
And around the same time,

253
00:13:11,112 --> 00:13:17,612
my daughter Haruna who was visiting the museum also disappeared.

254
00:13:17,612 --> 00:13:20,112
I was here in Kinosaki for business,

255
00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:22,512
"Kamachi Takeshi (45)" -received word from Director Kamachi,

256
00:13:22,512 --> 00:13:24,012
then with the help of my colleague,

257
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,785
I requested Hattori to search for my daughter.

258
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:30,012
So, what was the stolen piece?

259
00:13:30,012 --> 00:13:32,012
It was a piece called "The Rainbow's Child"

260
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:34,793
by a sculptor named Kaho Handa.

261
00:13:35,012 --> 00:13:36,512
Let's see.

262
00:13:38,412 --> 00:13:42,112
So this is the sculpture of "The Rainbow's Child".

263
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,112
So that means, when this sculpture was stolen,

264
00:13:44,112 --> 00:13:49,312
Haruna just happened to be there and was kidnapped.

265
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:52,512
Where could Haruna be?

266
00:13:52,512 --> 00:13:55,612
By the way, what about the clue?

267
00:13:55,612 --> 00:14:00,112
In fact, it looks like Haruna is here in Kinosaki.

268
00:14:00,112 --> 00:14:02,821
In Kinosaki?

269
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:04,112
This is...

270
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:08,012
It's Haruna! No doubt about it!

271
00:14:08,012 --> 00:14:10,412
Who is that man in the corner?

272
00:14:10,412 --> 00:14:12,512
We don't have proof,

273
00:14:12,512 --> 00:14:14,512
but we suspect he's probably the kidnapper!

274
00:14:14,512 --> 00:14:17,712
So it seems like your daughter ran away from the kidnapper,

275
00:14:17,712 --> 00:14:18,837
bumped into Ran,

276
00:14:19,012 --> 00:14:21,712
and they're on the run together!

277
00:14:21,712 --> 00:14:26,012
Ran. Why aren't you contacting us at all?

278
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:27,612
Could it be...

279
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:30,849
The man already...

280
00:14:35,764 --> 00:14:36,855
"Toyooka Caban Street"

281
00:14:37,064 --> 00:14:39,564
Toyooka means bags!

282
00:14:39,564 --> 00:14:42,564
Look, a bag vending machine!

283
00:14:42,564 --> 00:14:43,964
What a rare sight!

284
00:14:43,964 --> 00:14:45,664
Gotta buy one! Gotta buy it!

285
00:14:45,664 --> 00:14:47,864
The stork design looks nice!

286
00:14:47,864 --> 00:14:50,264
Hey, why don't you buy one too?

287
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,864
Hey, let me go!

288
00:14:59,664 --> 00:15:01,264
Excuse me.

289
00:15:01,264 --> 00:15:04,164
-Awesome! -It's full of bags!

290
00:15:04,164 --> 00:15:06,564
We're looking for a girl.

291
00:15:06,564 --> 00:15:11,164
Was there a girl who ordered the same bag like that one over there?

292
00:15:11,164 --> 00:15:12,891
Can you hang on for a minute?

293
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:14,893
Go ahead, please listen to them.

294
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:16,895
I'll be alright.

295
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:18,464
I apologize.

296
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:21,464
-By "backpack", you mean this one? -Yes.

297
00:15:21,464 --> 00:15:25,564
If it is, the most recent one was for Mr. Tabuse's Haruna.

298
00:15:25,564 --> 00:15:27,464
It was a pink backpack!

299
00:15:27,464 --> 00:15:29,564
Then, I'm pretty sure.

300
00:15:29,564 --> 00:15:31,364
Um...

301
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:34,064
"Iruka Yui (23), Dolphin Trainer" -Are you guys Haruna's friends?

302
00:15:34,064 --> 00:15:36,164
Something happen to Haruna?

303
00:15:36,664 --> 00:15:39,264
-Kinosaki Marine World? -Yes.

304
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:42,164
The dolphin trainer who knows Haruna

305
00:15:42,164 --> 00:15:45,264
called her colleague on a hunch,

306
00:15:45,264 --> 00:15:47,364
then they told her that they saw the two that fit the description.

307
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:48,464
Really?

308
00:15:48,464 --> 00:15:51,864
I'll give you a call when I find out more.

309
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:54,564
Hey! I'll be there too...

310
00:15:54,564 --> 00:15:56,364
Hold on!

311
00:15:56,364 --> 00:15:59,664
There are still things that need to be investigated in this city.

312
00:15:59,664 --> 00:16:01,964
I'll move for you!

313
00:16:01,964 --> 00:16:05,564
You just sit tight and tell us what we need to do!

314
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,864
Hattori...

315
00:16:07,864 --> 00:16:08,947
I appreciate it.

316
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:12,064
By the way, what happened to your leg?

317
00:16:12,064 --> 00:16:15,564
You weren't paying too much attention to that girl, were you?

318
00:16:15,564 --> 00:16:17,764
No way!

319
00:16:18,164 --> 00:16:20,959
"Kinosaki Marine World"

320
00:16:28,764 --> 00:16:29,864
Awesome!

321
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,564
Yui, you're cool!

322
00:16:33,364 --> 00:16:35,464
This is Genta, the sea lion!

323
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:38,764
Check it out! His name is Genta!

324
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,164
It's huge!

325
00:16:40,164 --> 00:16:42,764
Looks just like you. You two brothers?

326
00:16:42,764 --> 00:16:44,264
How is that possible!

327
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:47,964
We're not here to have fun.

328
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:02,664
She was also doing the same at that bag store.

329
00:17:03,364 --> 00:17:05,964
Have you seen this child?

330
00:17:05,964 --> 00:17:08,664
I'm looking for this child.

331
00:17:08,664 --> 00:17:11,009
I've seen this child.

332
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:15,964
There. They were visiting the Kishimojin.

333
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:18,564
Was searching for something?

334
00:17:18,564 --> 00:17:22,164
Yeah, while going around the spas

335
00:17:22,164 --> 00:17:23,464
and the usual tourist spots.

336
00:17:23,464 --> 00:17:27,025
And, have you heard of the Legend of Kishimojin?

337
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:29,464
"The Legend of Kishimojin"?

338
00:17:29,464 --> 00:17:31,964
I think...

339
00:17:31,964 --> 00:17:35,964
In ancient India, there was a demon with a thousand children,

340
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:39,037
feared for eating human children.

341
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:44,064
One day, Shakyamuni Buddha hid the demon's youngest child.

342
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,664
Buddha taught the mourning demon a lesson

343
00:17:46,664 --> 00:17:50,664
on how the parents suffered the loss of their children.

344
00:17:50,664 --> 00:17:53,051
From that point on,

345
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:55,464
the reformed demon became the God of easy delivery

346
00:17:55,464 --> 00:17:58,064
and the protector of children, the Kishimojin.

347
00:17:58,064 --> 00:18:02,364
They were also searching for something around the Kishimojin shrine.

348
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:05,864
Are they really being chased?

349
00:18:05,864 --> 00:18:07,764
Seems to me like

350
00:18:07,764 --> 00:18:10,364
Ran is being dragged around on a kid's sightseeing tour.

351
00:18:11,064 --> 00:18:13,564
Yeah, I recognize her.

352
00:18:13,564 --> 00:18:16,564
It's probably the family in this photo.

353
00:18:16,564 --> 00:18:18,864
This photo is from three years ago.

354
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:23,964
Haruna Tabuse. Her father, Shuuhei, her mother, Kaho.

355
00:18:23,964 --> 00:18:27,564
Kaho? If I'm not mistaken, Kaho is...

356
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,264
The sculptor of "The Rainbow's Child",

357
00:18:30,264 --> 00:18:33,564
Handa Kaho is your ex-wife

358
00:18:33,564 --> 00:18:36,264
and also Haruna's mother.

359
00:18:36,264 --> 00:18:38,064
Why didn't you tell us?

360
00:18:38,064 --> 00:18:41,764
That's a first for me too, Mr. Tabuse.

361
00:18:41,764 --> 00:18:44,264
I wasn't trying to hide the fact.

362
00:18:44,264 --> 00:18:47,105
Where is Kaho now?

363
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:51,764
That woman is...

364
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:55,113
That woman is a demon who took art over her own daughter!

365
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:57,664
I don't know where she is! I don't even want to know!

366
00:18:57,664 --> 00:19:00,364
Mr. Tabuse.

367
00:19:00,364 --> 00:19:03,121
But why did you exhibit

368
00:19:03,364 --> 00:19:05,123
the piece of a person whom you won't forgive?

369
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:08,464
That is...

370
00:19:08,464 --> 00:19:11,129
-I got it! That woman did it! -What?

371
00:19:12,364 --> 00:19:15,464
That woman stole "The Rainbow's Child"!

372
00:19:15,464 --> 00:19:18,364
Or, she made Haruna take it.

373
00:19:18,364 --> 00:19:21,139
That's what happened!

374
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:25,764
So, does that mean that suspicious person is Kaho in disguise?

375
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:29,964
I think that's a bit premature.

376
00:19:29,964 --> 00:19:32,464
That thing, Kabachi.

377
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:34,264
All right.

378
00:19:34,264 --> 00:19:37,864
A letter from Kaho addressed to Ms. Haruna.

379
00:19:37,864 --> 00:19:40,464
It was found by and acquired from the President.

380
00:19:40,464 --> 00:19:41,964
Excuse me.

381
00:19:41,964 --> 00:19:44,064
May I take a look?

382
00:19:44,064 --> 00:19:46,164
Sure.

383
00:19:46,164 --> 00:19:49,964
Let's see. "Kinosaki Springs and the Marine World.

384
00:19:49,964 --> 00:19:52,164
That was fun, wasn't it?

385
00:19:52,164 --> 00:19:54,464
Sure, you were still small,

386
00:19:54,464 --> 00:19:56,464
so you might not remember much."

387
00:19:56,464 --> 00:19:57,564
It's the same!

388
00:19:57,564 --> 00:20:00,764
The spas, play ground, and Kiyamachi Square.

389
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:03,564
Haruna's appeared in all the locations mentioned in this letter!

390
00:20:03,564 --> 00:20:09,187
So, Haruna is revisiting the locations they had visited in the past!

391
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:11,864
That woman is waiting for Haruna

392
00:20:11,864 --> 00:20:13,964
and "The Rainbow's Child" at one of those locations.

393
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:17,464
No. Then, they'll just need to specify a location.

394
00:20:17,464 --> 00:20:20,464
This is irritating me.

395
00:20:20,464 --> 00:20:22,864
-That's strange. -What's strange?

396
00:20:22,864 --> 00:20:24,664
Haruna also stopped by

397
00:20:24,664 --> 00:20:28,464
the Kinosaki Straw Crafting Tradition Hall

398
00:20:28,464 --> 00:20:30,964
that's not mentioned in the letter.

399
00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:32,764
On the other hand, they didn't stop by

400
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:36,064
the Kinosaki Art and Literature Hall that's in the letter.

401
00:20:36,064 --> 00:20:39,217
Let me see!

402
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:42,964
"I unexpectedly saw my friend, Michiko's straw craft

403
00:20:42,964 --> 00:20:45,664
at the Kinosaki Art and Literature Hall and..."

404
00:20:45,664 --> 00:20:47,225
Who's Michiko?

405
00:20:47,464 --> 00:20:49,664
Kaho's high school classmate

406
00:20:49,664 --> 00:20:51,564
and a straw crafting artist.

407
00:20:51,564 --> 00:20:55,233
But, how come Haruna went to where she's never been?

408
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:57,964
The memory is from three years ago, when she was five years old.

409
00:20:57,964 --> 00:20:59,764
She probably doesn't remember.

410
00:20:59,764 --> 00:21:01,764
Is that so?

411
00:21:01,764 --> 00:21:04,464
Something doesn't feel right.

412
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:06,264
What's this?

413
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:10,164
"I'll keep it with the memory of our trip."

414
00:21:10,164 --> 00:21:13,864
Hey, hey. What is the "it" mentioned here in the letter?

415
00:21:13,864 --> 00:21:16,164
I don't know.

416
00:21:16,164 --> 00:21:19,964
More important is where the daughter is headed next.

417
00:21:19,964 --> 00:21:25,564
That is probably Kinosaki Springs Station mentioned in the letter!

418
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:37,964
"Jibo Kannon Statue"

419
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,279
Yes! Maybe it's here!

420
00:21:41,464 --> 00:21:45,764
Hey, Haruna. What have you been looking for?

421
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:47,064
Hey!

422
00:21:48,964 --> 00:21:52,464
Where is it? Where is it?

423
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,964
Let me go!

424
00:21:58,964 --> 00:22:00,464
Haruna!

425
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:04,164
Let go of her!

426
00:22:04,164 --> 00:22:05,664
Don't move!

427
00:22:07,664 --> 00:22:09,307
Haruna!

428
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:12,664
Where did you put it?

429
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,664
-I don't know! -Stop right there!

430
00:22:17,315 --> 00:22:20,064
Haruna! Contact the police, now!

431
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:28,964
Miss!

432
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

433
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,180
"The Detectives Badge"

434
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:09,016
Got it, this badge will solve the case for sure!

435
00:24:09,016 --> 00:24:10,480
Genta, it's cold and it means delicious crabs.
