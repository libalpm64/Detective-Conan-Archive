1
00:00:02,344 --> 00:00:03,983
We've got a case! Kudo!

2
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:06,544
Huh?

3
00:00:08,644 --> 00:00:11,344
Hattori and Kazuha.

4
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,444
What do you mean by Kudo?

5
00:00:13,444 --> 00:00:14,444
Huh?

6
00:00:15,444 --> 00:00:16,944
You said that name just now, didn't you?

7
00:00:16,944 --> 00:00:18,644
"We've got a case, Kudo!"

8
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:22,001
I meant, "You all got a case to go to."

9
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:25,244
Things will end up becoming lively.

10
00:00:25,244 --> 00:00:26,544
It's a homicide,

11
00:00:26,544 --> 00:00:28,007
and yet what an inappropriate thing to say.

12
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:29,744
A homicide?

13
00:00:29,744 --> 00:00:31,644
Don't tell me you came all the way from Osaka

14
00:00:31,644 --> 00:00:33,744
to discuss a case that happened there?

15
00:00:33,744 --> 00:00:35,144
No, no!

16
00:00:35,144 --> 00:00:37,044
It happened here in Tokyo,

17
00:00:37,044 --> 00:00:40,544
and the witness is Mr. Otaki, here.

18
00:00:40,544 --> 00:00:43,044
Inspector Otaki from the Osaka City Police Department.

19
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:45,544
Hi there, long time no see!

20
00:00:45,544 --> 00:00:47,144
The case titled "Locked Room Murder

21
00:00:47,144 --> 00:00:50,029
Where the Feet and Help were Not in Reach."

22
00:00:50,244 --> 00:00:51,444
Right?

23
00:00:51,444 --> 00:00:53,344
Yeah, I suppose.

24
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:58,037
What's that supposed to be?

25
00:00:59,344 --> 00:01:01,044
Aim for a 100% solution.

26
00:01:01,044 --> 00:01:03,644
Clear all mysteries and codes.

27
00:01:03,644 --> 00:01:05,644
The mysterious murder that occurred in the elevator.

28
00:01:05,644 --> 00:01:07,844
It's a deduction battle between Hattori and me.

29
00:01:07,844 --> 00:01:09,444
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,344
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:11,344 --> 00:01:14,053
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:02:54,153 --> 00:03:00,159
"Everyone Was Watching (Part 1)"

33
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,481
-"Mouri Detective Agency" -What?

34
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,581
The man who was under police surveillance

35
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:05,581
was killed without anyone noticing?

36
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:08,881
Yes. Last month a man in his 70's

37
00:03:08,881 --> 00:03:12,581
died in his condo in Haido-cho.

38
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:16,175
The man who died called Hidemichi Mizuki,

39
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:19,481
used to be a high school teacher until a few years ago.

40
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:21,381
He taught a student

41
00:03:21,381 --> 00:03:23,781
by the name of Kiriya Hido back then.

42
00:03:23,781 --> 00:03:25,881
Kiriya Hido.

43
00:03:25,881 --> 00:03:27,781
That name sounds familiar.

44
00:03:29,481 --> 00:03:31,481
He's a serial killer who killed two people in Osaka

45
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:33,081
and one person in Kobe,

46
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:35,681
and was on the run.

47
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:38,197
We received intel that he was seen in Tokyo,

48
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:39,781
so we were working together with the MPD

49
00:03:39,781 --> 00:03:42,781
and staking out Mr. Mizuki's condo.

50
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:45,181
If there was anywhere that Hido,

51
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:46,981
who has no family around would rely on,

52
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:48,681
we thought that he would go to Mr. Mizuki's place

53
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:50,581
because he helped Hido look for a job and etc.

54
00:03:50,581 --> 00:03:52,211
And on the third day in the morning

55
00:03:52,381 --> 00:03:54,213
after staking out,

56
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:56,215
although it was time for him to come out

57
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:58,217
to go on his usual walk, he didn't so.

58
00:03:58,217 --> 00:03:59,381
I thought something was wrong

59
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:01,681
and went to check out his room.

60
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:03,981
I found Mr. Mizuki dead after hanging himself

61
00:04:03,981 --> 00:04:05,581
from a rope passed through

62
00:04:05,581 --> 00:04:09,481
the ventilation hole of the air conditioner.

63
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:13,681
Then, didn't he commit suicide?

64
00:04:13,681 --> 00:04:15,881
Of course you were keeping an eye on the window

65
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,381
and entrance of his room too. Weren't you?

66
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:18,981
Yes. That's why the case

67
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:22,241
was closed once as a suicide case

68
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:24,243
but the position of the toes of the suicide victim

69
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:26,245
was strangely very high.

70
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:29,981
That is, it was slightly under my crotch.

71
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:30,981
And surprisingly,

72
00:04:30,981 --> 00:04:32,581
the chair that was knocked over

73
00:04:32,581 --> 00:04:34,253
by the feet of the victim...

74
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:38,257
Was the same as the one in my kitchen!

75
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:40,981
That chair was a vintage produced in limited number

76
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,281
and they were all of the same size.

77
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:46,881
I measured it together with Mr. Otaki

78
00:04:46,881 --> 00:04:48,267
and found that from the toes of the dead body

79
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:49,681
to the seat of the chair

80
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:52,981
there was a space of more than 10cm!

81
00:04:52,981 --> 00:04:53,981
Hey, hey,

82
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:55,781
if there was a space of more than 10cm,

83
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:58,277
then he wouldn't reach it even if he stood on his tiptoes!

84
00:04:58,277 --> 00:04:59,381
Yeah.

85
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:00,981
In other words...

86
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:02,281
That chair was a prop

87
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:05,381
that the culprit deliberately put there

88
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:09,281
to make it look as if Mr. Mizuki had committed suicide!

89
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:11,081
I see. That's why,

90
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:14,281
"The Feet and Help were Not in Reach."

91
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:17,781
It seems that the room was not locked,

92
00:05:17,781 --> 00:05:19,981
so it was most likely homicide.

93
00:05:19,981 --> 00:05:24,303
It can't be that the killer called Kiriya Hido.

94
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:26,081
Wrong.

95
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:30,081
Kiriya Hido was arrested in Hiroshima

96
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:32,311
but, it seems he was spending the nights all this month

97
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:34,081
at an Internet Cafe.

98
00:05:34,081 --> 00:05:37,481
But, the police had their eyes on him, didn't they?

99
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:41,781
How did he go in and out?

100
00:05:41,781 --> 00:05:42,781
Right.

101
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:46,325
This is a case of circumstantial locked room murder.

102
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:48,327
We got permission from the bereaved family of the victim,

103
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:51,281
and are headed towards his condo from now.

104
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:53,881
And, you folks want to come along too, don't you?

105
00:05:57,181 --> 00:05:59,381
And, is it true that

106
00:05:59,381 --> 00:06:02,341
the crime scene is still left as is?

107
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:03,281
Yes.

108
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:05,781
The daughter of the victim said that she'd be coming

109
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:08,081
to get his belongings tomorrow, though.

110
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:10,349
Well, I guess there'd be no problem if we solved

111
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:12,681
the locked room murder case by today, right?

112
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:14,353
Look, look, Ran!

113
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:16,355
This elevator has a window!

114
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:19,481
There're quite a lot of them around! Those with windows on them.

115
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:21,381
Keep the noise down!

116
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,481
We aren't going on a play trip, you know!

117
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:25,181
I know!

118
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:27,181
I've got an important mission

119
00:06:27,181 --> 00:06:30,369
that only I can carry out, you know!

120
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:32,781
An important mission?

121
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,681
No doubt about it!

122
00:06:37,681 --> 00:06:39,981
This chair is the same as the one in my house!

123
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:43,081
Even the wood and the color are exactly the same!

124
00:06:43,081 --> 00:06:44,381
Don't you think there's something strange

125
00:06:44,381 --> 00:06:46,681
about this case after all, Heiji?

126
00:06:46,681 --> 00:06:49,081
I've been telling you that to begin with.

127
00:06:49,081 --> 00:06:51,481
Mission completed!

128
00:06:52,181 --> 00:06:55,381
I mean she didn't have to come all this way.

129
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:58,397
All she had to do was measure the height of the chair.

130
00:06:58,581 --> 00:06:59,781
So, now, the question is,

131
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:02,401
how did the culprit go in and out of this room

132
00:07:02,581 --> 00:07:04,403
under strict police surveillance?

133
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:08,407
Maybe there's a secret path somewhere?

134
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:10,409
Just as Inspector Otaki said,

135
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:12,411
the rope was passed through the ventilation hole

136
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:14,081
of the air conditioner.

137
00:07:14,081 --> 00:07:17,381
Huh? There's something on the ground right below the rope.

138
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:20,419
Shaved pencil debris?

139
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:23,681
It seems that the inhabitant of this room

140
00:07:23,681 --> 00:07:26,881
favored using pencils.

141
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,681
But, why would something like that be clumped up

142
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:31,881
and left on the floor like this?

143
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:33,981
From the looks of this room,

144
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:35,981
it seems that the inhabitant was pretty tidy

145
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:38,981
to the point of having a cleaning robot, and yet...

146
00:07:38,981 --> 00:07:41,181
And the cylinder type trash can that

147
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:43,881
is knocked over in the corner of the room.

148
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:47,081
A tidy inhabitant would never leave something like that as is.

149
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:52,451
Hey, Hattori, don't tell me that this is...

150
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,881
Yeah. I guess the answer is this.

151
00:07:56,681 --> 00:07:58,457
Hey, Heiji?

152
00:07:58,681 --> 00:08:01,581
Just what're you doing? Moving something like that around.

153
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:03,681
Solving a mystery.

154
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:04,463
Huh?

155
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:07,081
When Mr. Mizuki hung himself,

156
00:08:07,081 --> 00:08:10,469
he didn't use that chair as a foot stool.

157
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:12,781
He used this elongated trash box.

158
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:14,473
What?

159
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:17,681
He probably had this right under the rope.

160
00:08:17,681 --> 00:08:18,981
He stood it upside down

161
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:21,281
so that he could easily climb on it.

162
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:23,681
As proof of it, pencil shavings

163
00:08:23,681 --> 00:08:26,481
were found clumped up around here.

164
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:28,487
When he turned the trash box upside down, the shavings

165
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:32,491
that were stuck at the bottom of the trash box fell out.

166
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:33,481
See?

167
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:35,281
This is higher than the chair

168
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:36,881
and his feet would reach too, right?

169
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:38,497
But, Heiji.

170
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:42,181
When we came in, there was no such thing.

171
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:45,381
No problem.

172
00:08:46,681 --> 00:08:48,781
When he hung himself, if he kicks the trash box over

173
00:08:48,781 --> 00:08:52,181
so that it is caught between the legs of the chair.

174
00:08:55,581 --> 00:08:57,681
All that needed to be done, was for the cleaning robot

175
00:08:57,681 --> 00:08:59,881
to push the trash can over to the corner of the room.

176
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:02,521
Then, return to its original battery charging base.

177
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:04,181
This way, this strange situation

178
00:09:04,181 --> 00:09:06,781
of the man being hung is completed!

179
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:08,527
The evidence is that

180
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:11,381
the robot only cleans this route.

181
00:09:11,381 --> 00:09:13,781
I'm sure that the robot was probably made to

182
00:09:13,781 --> 00:09:15,181
memorize this route

183
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:18,537
by putting obstacles in place as needed.

184
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:20,181
Hey, hold it.

185
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:21,781
Then, this case...

186
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:24,543
Yeah. No matter how you look at it...

187
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:26,545
It's a suicide.

188
00:09:30,081 --> 00:09:31,181
Heiji.

189
00:09:31,181 --> 00:09:32,551
Are you okay?

190
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,555
Too bad there was no chance to pitch in.

191
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:39,681
But, why did Mr. Mizuki decide to die like that?

192
00:09:39,681 --> 00:09:41,781
Mr. Mizuki goofed at stocks

193
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,281
and seems to have been in great debt.

194
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:46,565
And, it seemed he really hated that stock broker

195
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:49,281
who caused him to end up that way.

196
00:09:49,281 --> 00:09:51,981
He seems to have said when he was drunk

197
00:09:51,981 --> 00:09:55,281
that he would go to hell together with that guy.

198
00:09:55,281 --> 00:09:58,577
That's why he wanted to make it look

199
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:00,579
as if that broker killed him, maybe.

200
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:01,481
But, unfortunately,

201
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:04,281
because he was under police surveillance,

202
00:10:04,281 --> 00:10:06,381
it was concluded without a doubt

203
00:10:06,381 --> 00:10:09,581
that he committed suicide.

204
00:10:09,581 --> 00:10:11,181
By the way, does that broker

205
00:10:11,181 --> 00:10:13,381
live in this neighborhood?

206
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:14,593
Neighborhood's not the word.

207
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:17,581
It seems that he moved over there last year.

208
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:19,181
If I remember correctly, his name is...

209
00:10:19,181 --> 00:10:21,781
Mr. Fuura who lives on the 2nd floor, right?

210
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:25,581
Everybody in this condo finds him to be a nuisance!

211
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:28,607
-Huh? -He talks about stocks with people

212
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:31,081
who are waiting for the elevator.

213
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:33,581
At first you make a little profit but,

214
00:10:33,581 --> 00:10:35,281
the minute you let him take care of a large sum,

215
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:37,181
you lose a large amount.

216
00:10:37,181 --> 00:10:39,481
Even my husband almost fell for it,

217
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:41,881
and it was tough trying to stop him from doing so.

218
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:44,623
Oh, is that so?

219
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:46,881
He was really like Death

220
00:10:46,881 --> 00:10:48,627
and his face looked just like Death too!

221
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:50,381
His had hollow eyes and cheeks.

222
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:52,381
His complexion was pale.

223
00:10:52,381 --> 00:10:54,633
Oh. Talk of the devil.

224
00:10:57,881 --> 00:11:00,181
-Wh... -What?

225
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:09,072
Darn! It went up!

226
00:11:09,072 --> 00:11:11,072
Mr. Otaki, where's the stairs?

227
00:11:11,072 --> 00:11:13,072
I think it was...

228
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:15,672
You should know since you live here, don't you?

229
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:18,972
Never mind! I'll look for it myself!

230
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:20,272
Hold it!

231
00:11:20,272 --> 00:11:21,472
It's come down.

232
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,661
What?

233
00:11:43,072 --> 00:11:45,272
What? You were investigating a case

234
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:47,672
that was closed as a suicide case?

235
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:50,689
Yes. There was something that bothered me a bit, you see.

236
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:53,972
I took a break and came over from Osaka.

237
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:54,972
After investigating,

238
00:11:54,972 --> 00:11:58,072
it was concluded to be a suicide case after all.

239
00:11:58,072 --> 00:11:59,672
Just as I was about to leave

240
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:01,572
on the elevator along with Mr. Mouri and the others

241
00:12:01,572 --> 00:12:04,172
who came along with me to help me.

242
00:12:04,172 --> 00:12:07,272
I ran into this site.

243
00:12:07,272 --> 00:12:09,672
I see.

244
00:12:09,672 --> 00:12:11,572
The deceased is Mr. Kaizo Fuura

245
00:12:11,572 --> 00:12:15,172
who lives on the 2nd floor of this condo.

246
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:18,272
He seems to have been a stock broker.

247
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:20,172
Correct, isn't it?

248
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,772
Yes, sir.

249
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:23,972
Who is she?

250
00:12:23,972 --> 00:12:25,472
She was trying to go downstairs

251
00:12:25,472 --> 00:12:28,172
and rode the elevator with us.

252
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:31,172
Her name is Nanami and she lives on the 3rd floor.

253
00:12:31,172 --> 00:12:35,172
It seems she goes to an esthetic salon every week at this time.

254
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:37,672
In other words, when the door of the elevator opened,

255
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:40,072
this is what you saw.

256
00:12:40,072 --> 00:12:41,372
Wrong, Mr. Takagi.

257
00:12:41,372 --> 00:12:43,572
From the window of the elevator that came from below,

258
00:12:43,572 --> 00:12:46,745
we saw Mr. Fuura riding the elevator.

259
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:49,772
He shot himself in the temple with a gun.

260
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:55,972
It was just as if he wanted to show us what he was doing.

261
00:12:55,972 --> 00:12:59,372
Which means that the elevator went up as is?

262
00:12:59,372 --> 00:13:00,759
Yeah. I was going to confirm

263
00:13:00,972 --> 00:13:04,072
where he was getting off so I went up the stairs but...

264
00:13:04,072 --> 00:13:06,372
this elevator came down right away

265
00:13:06,372 --> 00:13:08,472
and when the door opened...

266
00:13:08,472 --> 00:13:11,672
This is what we saw.

267
00:13:11,672 --> 00:13:14,072
Then, this is undoubtedly a suicide, no?

268
00:13:14,072 --> 00:13:17,972
Yes. There's this message here too, you see.

269
00:13:19,972 --> 00:13:21,972
Good...

270
00:13:21,972 --> 00:13:24,572
Goodbye?

271
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:27,772
There's a spray can by the feet of the corpse,

272
00:13:27,772 --> 00:13:29,872
rolling on the floor, see?

273
00:13:29,872 --> 00:13:31,472
I think he used it to write what he did

274
00:13:31,472 --> 00:13:33,372
just before he died.

275
00:13:33,372 --> 00:13:35,772
A will, I guess.

276
00:13:35,772 --> 00:13:38,072
That's why, no matter how you try looking at this,

277
00:13:38,072 --> 00:13:39,072
it's definitely...

278
00:13:39,072 --> 00:13:40,472
A murder.

279
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:42,472
Huh?

280
00:13:42,472 --> 00:13:44,172
I'm telling you that no matter

281
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:47,072
how you look at it, this is murder!

282
00:13:47,072 --> 00:13:49,272
You mean this is a murder case?

283
00:13:49,272 --> 00:13:50,272
Yeah.

284
00:13:50,272 --> 00:13:52,572
Don't say something so irresponsible!

285
00:13:52,572 --> 00:13:53,872
The case that you claimed to be a homicide

286
00:13:53,872 --> 00:13:56,372
turned out to be a suicide case after all too, you know!

287
00:13:56,372 --> 00:13:58,817
Take a good look at the surveillance camera

288
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:02,272
set up above the floor indicator of the elevator then.

289
00:14:02,272 --> 00:14:04,823
It's covered with spray paint, isn't it?

290
00:14:05,972 --> 00:14:07,872
True.

291
00:14:07,872 --> 00:14:10,572
That's why I called the manager of this condo

292
00:14:10,572 --> 00:14:12,272
and confirmed.

293
00:14:12,272 --> 00:14:15,272
Then, I was told that a hand holding the spray can

294
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:17,872
suddenly appeared on the monitor and sprayed the camera.

295
00:14:17,872 --> 00:14:19,572
Since the culprit

296
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:21,172
didn't want to be in view of the camera,

297
00:14:21,172 --> 00:14:25,872
he stretched over his hand to cover it with spray.

298
00:14:25,872 --> 00:14:29,872
But, maybe he just didn't want the camera

299
00:14:29,872 --> 00:14:31,872
recording the suicide.

300
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:34,853
It was clearly on the recorded image.

301
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:38,372
The right hand of someone holding the spray can!

302
00:14:39,372 --> 00:14:41,472
I'm sure it was the right hand.

303
00:14:41,472 --> 00:14:44,472
Most Japanese people are right handed after all, you see.

304
00:14:44,472 --> 00:14:46,865
Hold it there!

305
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:49,572
This man is holding the gun in his left hand.

306
00:14:49,572 --> 00:14:51,672
Maybe he's left handed?

307
00:14:51,672 --> 00:14:54,873
Everybody knows that Mr. Fuura is left handed.

308
00:14:55,072 --> 00:14:58,872
I see! His left hand was holding the gun so...

309
00:14:58,872 --> 00:15:00,879
Then, do you mean that he went out of his way

310
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,672
to hold the can in his right hand to write the word?

311
00:15:03,672 --> 00:15:07,272
Besides, the wristwatch that he's wearing.

312
00:15:07,272 --> 00:15:09,472
It's not unusual for a left-handed person

313
00:15:09,472 --> 00:15:12,891
to be wearing his wristwatch on his left wrist.

314
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:15,272
No. It's stopped.

315
00:15:15,272 --> 00:15:18,272
At the time when we found the corpse.

316
00:15:18,272 --> 00:15:19,872
Then, maybe it ran out of battery

317
00:15:19,872 --> 00:15:22,272
or broke when he fell.

318
00:15:22,272 --> 00:15:25,872
But this wristwatch...

319
00:15:25,872 --> 00:15:27,472
winds automatically!

320
00:15:27,472 --> 00:15:29,172
It winds itself automatically

321
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:31,772
when the person wearing it moves, right?

322
00:15:31,772 --> 00:15:34,372
See! It moves when it's shaken.

323
00:15:34,372 --> 00:15:36,172
Isn't it strange?

324
00:15:36,172 --> 00:15:37,672
True.

325
00:15:37,672 --> 00:15:39,172
That's probably because...

326
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,672
The one who wanted to kill Mr. Fuura

327
00:15:41,672 --> 00:15:43,872
deliberately made him wear the wristwatch

328
00:15:43,872 --> 00:15:47,672
right after committing the crime.

329
00:15:47,672 --> 00:15:49,672
I don't know why yet, though.

330
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:51,372
But the fact that, that someone

331
00:15:51,372 --> 00:15:55,672
is still somewhere here above the 3rd floor is what I do know.

332
00:15:55,672 --> 00:15:57,472
After finding the corpse, I called

333
00:15:57,472 --> 00:15:58,937
the manager's room on the 1st floor right away

334
00:15:59,172 --> 00:16:01,472
and had them guard the stairs, you see.

335
00:16:01,472 --> 00:16:02,941
Until you people from the police came,

336
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:06,945
there's no one who used the stairs to come down, you see!

337
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:09,972
Would you like me to go check each and every room?

338
00:16:09,972 --> 00:16:11,572
Yes.

339
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:14,372
Then, let 's start from the 4th floor right above.

340
00:16:14,372 --> 00:16:16,972
Three rooms?

341
00:16:16,972 --> 00:16:20,072
There were only three suspicious rooms?

342
00:16:20,072 --> 00:16:21,472
This building is a seven story building

343
00:16:21,472 --> 00:16:24,672
and there are many rooms above the 3rd floor and yet...

344
00:16:24,672 --> 00:16:27,772
Yes. Because of the suicide last month,

345
00:16:27,772 --> 00:16:30,372
there seems to have been many people who moved out.

346
00:16:30,372 --> 00:16:32,072
At any rate, the only ones who live alone

347
00:16:32,072 --> 00:16:36,772
and had no alibi were the inhabitants of these three rooms.

348
00:16:36,772 --> 00:16:42,472
If so, let's go hear the story of those three people once again.

349
00:16:42,472 --> 00:16:44,672
I don't think that the person would think

350
00:16:44,672 --> 00:16:47,372
it possible that he would be suspected so soon too.

351
00:16:47,372 --> 00:16:50,989
No good. Heiji's switch is turned on.

352
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:52,772
What shall I do, when it's almost time for the bullet train

353
00:16:52,772 --> 00:16:54,272
we're taking back home is going to depart.

354
00:16:54,272 --> 00:16:57,472
I guess you'll just have to sleep over at our place.

355
00:16:59,972 --> 00:17:02,472
Murder?

356
00:17:02,472 --> 00:17:05,572
Didn't Mr. Fuura commit suicide?

357
00:17:05,572 --> 00:17:09,372
No. The fact that he may have been murdered also emerged.

358
00:17:09,372 --> 00:17:13,011
But, why do you know about this?

359
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:17,272
Because Nanami twitted on the internet that.

360
00:17:17,272 --> 00:17:21,772
"'Death' committed suicide in the elevator of our condo."

361
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:24,372
"Death" refers to Mr. Fuura, the nickname

362
00:17:24,372 --> 00:17:27,572
that Nanami gave him.

363
00:17:27,572 --> 00:17:30,772
That lady was twittering when she was working her cell phone

364
00:17:30,772 --> 00:17:33,031
without saying a word.

365
00:17:34,472 --> 00:17:37,035
I hope you don't mind me stepping in a bit.

366
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:38,572
No.

367
00:17:38,572 --> 00:17:40,472
I don't mind.

368
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,472
By the way, what do you do for a living?

369
00:17:45,472 --> 00:17:48,472
I'm employed at a building maintenance company.

370
00:17:48,472 --> 00:17:50,772
I handle intercoms and locker deliveries.

371
00:17:50,772 --> 00:17:52,372
I also handle air conditioners.

372
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,672
Which means you also handle

373
00:17:54,672 --> 00:17:57,055
elevator and security maintenance?

374
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:59,057
Yes. Sort of.

375
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:02,072
By the way, who are those young men?

376
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:05,063
Please don't let them bother you.

377
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:06,472
By the way, you.

378
00:18:06,472 --> 00:18:09,772
What's your relationship with Mr. Fuura, the deceased?

379
00:18:09,772 --> 00:18:13,672
Your name was in Mr. Fuura's cell phone, you see.

380
00:18:13,672 --> 00:18:16,372
Oh, well, I talked to him a bit about stocks.

381
00:18:16,372 --> 00:18:19,772
Which means that you lost out on stocks

382
00:18:19,772 --> 00:18:21,972
because of Mr. Fuura, and hated him too?

383
00:18:21,972 --> 00:18:24,572
It's true that I had a grudge against him,

384
00:18:24,572 --> 00:18:26,472
but I wouldn't kill him because of it.

385
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,872
Please stick your hands forward, then.

386
00:18:28,872 --> 00:18:30,272
Hands?

387
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:35,872
Don't tell me that you're arresting me just like that?

388
00:18:35,872 --> 00:18:37,672
No.

389
00:18:37,672 --> 00:18:39,097
We're just checking to see

390
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:41,372
if there are any discharge residue

391
00:18:41,372 --> 00:18:43,772
on your hands and sleeves after a gun is fired.

392
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:46,772
Since the forensic officers are here too.

393
00:18:48,472 --> 00:18:50,872
It's true that I lost out too,

394
00:18:50,872 --> 00:18:54,072
because of the stocks Mr. Fuura recommended me to buy.

395
00:18:54,072 --> 00:18:55,972
But, I don't have any grudge against him!

396
00:18:55,972 --> 00:18:58,072
Because it's my fault too for not being able to read

397
00:18:58,072 --> 00:19:01,372
the direction of where the stocks were headed for, you see.

398
00:19:03,772 --> 00:19:05,972
This room smells of thinner.

399
00:19:05,972 --> 00:19:07,672
That's because I was coloring

400
00:19:07,672 --> 00:19:09,572
the freshly severed-like dolls' necks.

401
00:19:09,572 --> 00:19:11,872
Freshly severed necks?

402
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:16,572
They're making a splatter movie at my university,

403
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,372
and that's what they're going to be used for!

404
00:19:18,372 --> 00:19:21,139
It's really well made, though.

405
00:19:21,372 --> 00:19:23,141
They look real.

406
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:26,272
I'm sure that Ran would faint if she saw them.

407
00:19:26,272 --> 00:19:29,972
That one over there looks exactly like my Dad.

408
00:19:29,972 --> 00:19:32,872
If so, I'm sure you can make it then, no?

409
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:34,072
A freshly made severed neck

410
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,472
that looks exactly like Mr. Fuura?

411
00:19:36,472 --> 00:19:38,672
Then, do you also take scenes of people

412
00:19:38,672 --> 00:19:40,672
are shot successively with guns?

413
00:19:40,672 --> 00:19:42,772
Not much of that.

414
00:19:42,772 --> 00:19:44,472
I usually take movies of people being stabbed,

415
00:19:44,472 --> 00:19:46,172
slashed or chopped up.

416
00:19:46,172 --> 00:19:49,172
Do you have it too?

417
00:19:49,172 --> 00:19:51,169
The same wristwatch as Mr. Fuura?

418
00:19:51,372 --> 00:19:54,272
Yeah. I got it as a gift from Mr. Fuura

419
00:19:54,272 --> 00:19:56,672
when I made out on the first stocks I bought.

420
00:19:56,672 --> 00:19:58,572
Mr. Mutsu that we talked to a while ago

421
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,772
was also wearing the same wristwatch.

422
00:20:00,772 --> 00:20:04,172
Well, it seems that yours is moving like it should be, though.

423
00:20:04,172 --> 00:20:06,472
I usually wear it, you see.

424
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:07,972
Although I'm not wearing it now

425
00:20:07,972 --> 00:20:09,672
to keep from getting paint on it.

426
00:20:09,672 --> 00:20:11,872
Then, please show me your hands

427
00:20:11,872 --> 00:20:13,772
so I can check for discharge residue.

428
00:20:13,772 --> 00:20:17,672
Okay, but I was painting, you know.

429
00:20:17,672 --> 00:20:19,772
So, it's like this.

430
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:23,201
Yes. If it's that wristwatch,

431
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:26,072
I also got it from Mr. Fuura.

432
00:20:26,072 --> 00:20:29,207
In celebration of profiting from stocks.

433
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:31,209
I just wore it once and put it in my drawer,

434
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:32,872
never to take it out again.

435
00:20:32,872 --> 00:20:37,572
Ms. Izutsu, what do you do for a living?

436
00:20:37,572 --> 00:20:40,772
Can't you tell by looking?

437
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:44,072
A tracing table, tone, cutter knife.

438
00:20:44,072 --> 00:20:45,772
A G-pen, mapping pen, a brush,

439
00:20:45,772 --> 00:20:47,872
calligraphy paint and ink.

440
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,227
I'm a cartoonist!

441
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:52,572
Haven't you ever heard of my pen name Kotori Misono?

442
00:20:52,572 --> 00:20:55,872
You're the author of the beautiful detective girl cartoon

443
00:20:55,872 --> 00:20:57,572
that Chiba is hooked on.

444
00:20:57,572 --> 00:21:01,239
Which means it wouldn't be hard for you

445
00:21:01,472 --> 00:21:03,241
to come up with a story to make it look

446
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:05,243
as if someone committed suicide in the elevator

447
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:07,245
by using a gun, and kill him.

448
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,249
If I came up with such an amusing story,

449
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:13,251
I would've drawn a comic about it already.

450
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:17,972
It's too wasteful to use such a story on a guy like him.

451
00:21:17,972 --> 00:21:21,272
How come you have four tracing tables?

452
00:21:21,272 --> 00:21:23,772
Three are for my assistants.

453
00:21:23,772 --> 00:21:25,263
They left after finishing what they had to do

454
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:26,472
this morning, though.

455
00:21:26,472 --> 00:21:28,772
I always thought that the room of a cartoonist

456
00:21:28,772 --> 00:21:30,772
would be full of books,

457
00:21:30,772 --> 00:21:32,772
but you don't have too many.

458
00:21:32,772 --> 00:21:36,572
You can say that again. There are only a few comic books lined out.

459
00:21:36,572 --> 00:21:39,872
Just what age are you talking about anyway?

460
00:21:39,872 --> 00:21:41,279
Don't put me in the same categories as cartoonists

461
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:43,281
in the past, mind you?

462
00:21:44,172 --> 00:21:48,972
I would like to check your hands for now.

463
00:21:49,772 --> 00:21:52,472
I don't mind.

464
00:21:52,472 --> 00:21:54,572
Too bad I disappointed you.

465
00:21:54,572 --> 00:21:57,572
As you can see, I just finished taking a bath.

466
00:21:57,572 --> 00:22:01,572
The discharge residue would've washed off already.

467
00:22:02,772 --> 00:22:05,303
Mr. Mouri, did you come up with something?

468
00:22:05,303 --> 00:22:07,305
No, not at all.

469
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:09,307
All three of them seem suspicious

470
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:11,309
and on the other hand, not.

471
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:13,572
No. The culprit is probably

472
00:22:13,572 --> 00:22:16,572
that person who was hiding that thing.

473
00:22:16,572 --> 00:22:19,317
The question is the trick.

474
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,572
How did the culprit kill Mr. Fuura?

475
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,724
Next Conan's Hint:

476
00:23:48,724 --> 00:23:50,680
"Word Written With Spray"

477
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,800
Kakudo, Kokudo and Sokudo.

478
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,411
What is that?

479
00:23:53,582 --> 00:23:55,413
They're words of excuses that I can use the next time I mistakenly call you Kudo.
