1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,740
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,540
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,440
A gun is between Conan and Haibara.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,140
While Ran is putting on quite a performance with a certain someone.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,640
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,490
We, the Youth Detective Squad,

9
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,990
go on a camping trip with Doctor Agasa.

10
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,390
And find a limestone cave in the forest.

11
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,690
We immediately decide to go in and explore it.

12
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,790
But inside the cave,

13
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,190
we come across a gang of bank robbers

14
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,990
who are trying to hide the body of one of their partners.

15
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,490
And of all the bad luck,

16
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,090
I am shot and seriously injured.

17
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,290
But thanks to the good work of the Youth Detective Squad,

18
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,690
we escaped and the robbers were arrested.

19
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,690
I was quickly taken to the hospital

20
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,490
and thanks to Ran whose blood they used for my transfusion,

21
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,890
I pulled through.

22
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,290
I have the same blood type as him.

23
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,690
Ran knew for sure.

24
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,190
She knew my blood type.

25
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,890
She knows who I am.

26
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,390
And just when I figured the only option I had

27
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,190
was to tell Ran the whole truth...

28
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,390
Haibara comes and points a gun at me!

29
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:04,990
"Perilous Return: The Third Choice"

30
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,790
Haibara...

31
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,390
Sorry about this.

32
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,090
I guess

33
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,190
there was still some bad blood flowing through me.

34
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,190
What?

35
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,690
What? You didn't you know?

36
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,590
My cover has been blown.

37
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,590
By those you call "men in black".

38
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,490
Want to know how?

39
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:34,190
It was that incident at the Haido City Hotel.

40
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,190
I never dreamed it would happen.

41
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,190
Who would have thought there was another man there

42
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,490
besides Pisco.

43
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,390
What he told them

44
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,390
made the organization suspect

45
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,290
the potion turned me into a child.

46
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,590
And they found out where I was and contacted me this morning.

47
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,890
I thought they'd kill me off right there.

48
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,690
But they said that if I returned to the organization,

49
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,290
they'd overlook the fact I betrayed them.

50
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:07,790
They want me to get back to developing the APTX 4869,

51
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,190
that's their objective.

52
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,990
So that's it.

53
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,990
That's why you're here to kill me

54
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,790
because I know about your organization.

55
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,090
That's right.

56
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,090
That's what they told me I had to do if I want to go back.

57
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,090
Of course, your parents and your detective friend in Osaka

58
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,490
will also be killed tomorrow.

59
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,290
I'm sorry about this.

60
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,890
But Doctor Agasa's been taken hostage.

61
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,890
So, this is the only thing I can do to save him.

62
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,690
But you can also thank me.

63
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,590
You won't have to see your parents or your friend get killed.

64
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,590
Because I'm going to kill you first.

65
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,990
What do you think?

66
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,290
-What? -What if...

67
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,690
there really was someone like that at the hotel?

68
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:06,690
And what if they did find me and take the doctor as hostage?

69
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,890
I will do exactly like what I just did, you know.

70
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,890
But then it's a sure bet

71
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:16,490
that they will kill anyone and everyone I came in contact with.

72
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,090
No doubt about that.

73
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,490
Hey, what are you trying to get at?

74
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,990
I came here to make things clear to you.

75
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,690
Make what clear?

76
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,190
If you let your feelings get the best of you

77
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,590
and you tell her about the organization,

78
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,390
I want you to know that

79
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:37,190
she'll certainly be one of those the organization gets rid of.

80
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,890
Do you mean Ran?

81
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,890
That's right.

82
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:46,590
I'm almost positive she knows who you are.

83
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:51,090
And you're thinking you can't fool her this time.

84
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,290
So, you're thinking of telling her

85
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,290
all about the potion and the organization.

86
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,290
And get everything off of your chest.

87
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,690
Why are you so surprised?

88
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:05,590
Anyone could tell by looking at you now.

89
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,390
If I can see through you,

90
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,290
she probably can, too.

91
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,490
She might just be thinking,

92
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:15,090
"He's going to tell me any day now."

93
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,090
Oh, come on.

94
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,590
You have three choices.

95
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,890
Three?

96
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,090
The first is,

97
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,290
leave things as it is,

98
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,690
don't tell her anything and keep your distance.

99
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,890
Second,

100
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,090
you cast your fates to the wind

101
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,490
and tell her everything.

102
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,290
Or your third choice which is...

103
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:45,790
"Teitan High School Festival"

104
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,490
"Shuffle Romance"

105
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,390
Good grief, I don't believe this.

106
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,290
Why are there so many people out there?

107
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,690
And we're up next, too!

108
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,390
That's because they've heard good things about it!

109
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,590
After all, it's being billed as the best love romance

110
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,390
surpassing even "Romeo and Juliet"!

111
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,490
Ran!

112
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,590
Kazuha!

113
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,490
I decided to come after all!

114
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,090
Heiji said I shouldn't since I'd only be imposing, though.

115
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,290
You mean Hattori didn't come with you?

116
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,190
Oh, shucks! I have a secret crush on him, though.

117
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,290
What?

118
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,090
She's just joking!

119
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:34,890
Sonoko's crazy about another tall dark boy, aren't you?

120
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,990
Well, excuse me for liking them tall and dark.

121
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,390
And where is Kudo?

122
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,290
I didn't invite him.

123
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,490
Gosh.

124
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,990
You invite old friends and people from your neighborhood,

125
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,390
but you don't invite your honey, I don't understand you.

126
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,590
Oh, I get it.

127
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:56,390
I'm not the only one you invited today.

128
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,390
Conan, I'm glad you could make it!

129
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,090
He's still got a cold,

130
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,590
so I told to him stay at home and rest.

131
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,490
He said he promised to come so nothing could stop him.

132
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,690
How are you?

133
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,890
Do you feel okay?

134
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,190
I'm okay.

135
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,290
Don't push yourself just for me.

136
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,190
Ran, may I speak to you?

137
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,290
It's about the cue to the last dialogue.

138
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,690
Be right there.

139
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,490
He's nice looking!

140
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,590
Is he by chance her partner in the play?

141
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:27,490
That's right! Don't you think they make a nice couple?

142
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,290
Well, I'll be going to my seat now.

143
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,290
Don't get nervous!

144
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,690
Good luck!

145
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:39,490
Oh, no! It's 15 minutes before stage time!

146
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,890
We've got to change into our costumes!

147
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,190
Sorry it took so long.

148
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,890
What took you so long?

149
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,990
"Yota Mitani (27)" -I'm dying of thirst.

150
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,390
"Mai Kogami (28)" -Sorry about that,

151
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,690
but the concession was pretty crowded.

152
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,290
I have to go to the restroom, could you take these?

153
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,390
Are you going now?

154
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,490
"Yumemi Noda (27)" -Then, you'd better hurry, Mai.

155
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,190
I think it's about to start.

156
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,490
Really?

157
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,490
I have less than a minute left. I better hurry.

158
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,390
Hurry!

159
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,690
Let's see, Mai has an iced coffee and...

160
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,990
Mine's orange juice.

161
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,390
Orange juice.

162
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,990
-Here. -Thank you.

163
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,890
Kohei, you're having iced coffee, aren't you?

164
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,590
Yes.

165
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,990
Mine is the oolong tea.

166
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,390
"Kohei Kamata (28)"

167
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,890
No way...

168
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,490
It's her...

169
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,790
"Ayako Ninagawa (18)"

170
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,290
What's wrong?

171
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,390
No, it's nothing.

172
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:46,990
The B group of the junior class will now perform "Shuffle Romance".

173
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,090
I hope you all enjoy the play.

174
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,890
Omniscient and omnipotent God Zeus!

175
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,890
Why do you subject me to such cruelty?

176
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,090
Or are you telling me to resign myself to this marriage

177
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,590
that I do not wish?

178
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,290
That's the way, show us your stuff!

179
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,490
Well, that's my daughter up there!

180
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,090
Oh, how embarrassing.

181
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,890
I want to change my seat.

182
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,290
It's the first climatic scene!

183
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,790
Hurry and get up there to stand by for...

184
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,190
Who are you ruffians?

185
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,890
Do you realize this is Princess Heart's carriage?

186
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,590
Her father is the Duke Bridge!

187
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,490
Of course, we know that!

188
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,190
Our orders are to kill the princess

189
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,590
so the wedding doesn't take place!

190
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,190
To our empire,

191
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,490
it is more convenient

192
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,690
for the Duke and the King to remain at odds.

193
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,590
It is to our benefit.

194
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,690
Get out of the way!

195
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,290
Come!

196
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,690
Ran, give him a karate chop!

197
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,090
Take those guys out!

198
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,990
-Huh? -Raven feathers?

199
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,290
It can't be...

200
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,090
Black knight?

201
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,290
He is so cool!

202
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,090
Darn it! Let's get out of here!

203
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,990
You've saved me not once but twice.

204
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,490
Just who are you?

205
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,390
Unnamed knight with your black cloak,

206
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,590
if you would grant me my wish,

207
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,790
please remove that dark mask that you're wearing.

208
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,190
And show me your face.

209
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,590
Ran, you're so lucky.

210
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:57,990
Mr. Arade.

211
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,390
This wasn't in the script.

212
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,690
That animal...

213
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,690
What is he doing to my young daughter?

214
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,190
Unforgivable!

215
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,390
Don't go up there, sir! Don't interrupt them!

216
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,190
This is the best part!

217
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,690
Sonoko.

218
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,390
What am I supposed to do?

219
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,590
"Just keep going!"

220
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,790
What do you mean keep going?

221
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,890
Are you sure about this?

222
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,590
Could you by chance be Spade?

223
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,090
The man my father slashed between the eyes,

224
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,490
then threw out of our land.

225
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,190
But no one dreamt you were the prince of Trump empire.

226
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,690
If you haven't forgotten the promise we made

227
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,590
when we were children,

228
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,390
please...

229
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,890
Plant a kiss upon my lips.

230
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,790
You idiot! What are you saying, Ran?

231
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,980
The deceased is Kohei Kamata, 27 years old.

232
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,880
He's a doctor at the Beika General Hospital, right?

233
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,380
-That's right. -You say he collapsed...

234
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,480
while watching the play, right?

235
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,280
It seemed as if he was suddenly overcome with pain.

236
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,780
Then, he just collapsed.

237
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,180
Could he have collapsed

238
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,580
after drinking the contents of this cup?

239
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,680
I don't know.

240
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,280
I was concentrating on the play.

241
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,380
There isn't much left inside.

242
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:01,680
At approximately what time did Mr. Kamata collapse?

243
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,780
Let's see...

244
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,680
The play started a little after 2...

245
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,180
I believe it was about 2:40 pm.

246
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,080
Ran?

247
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,980
We heard the scream

248
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,380
during the climatic scene in the first half of the play.

249
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,780
Isn't that right, Mr. Arade?

250
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,480
Mr. Arade?

251
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,580
Oh, I get it!

252
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,480
This is Ran's high school and it's their school festival!

253
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,880
Which means...

254
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,780
That fellow must also be here.

255
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,380
Are you looking for somebody, Inspector?

256
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,480
I certainly am looking for you!

257
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,080
You murder magnet!

258
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,580
So, you've finally brought bad luck onto your daughter's school.

259
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,380
And? You did make sure

260
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,880
that no one got close to the corpse, didn't you?

261
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,880
Of course, Inspector!

262
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,180
Preserving the scene of the crime

263
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,480
is one of the most basic steps in crime solving.

264
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,780
This officer was the first one to touch the body.

265
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,780
Have you determined the cause of death?

266
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,980
Yes, I'm certain this was...

267
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,080
It was potassium cyanide.

268
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,280
What?

269
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,280
I'm sure this guy died after drinking potassium cyanide.

270
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
Hey!

271
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,580
I thought you said no one touched the body!

272
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,380
Well, I didn't see anybody...

273
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,480
You fool!

274
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,680
You don't have to touch the body

275
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,580
to figure out how he died.

276
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,680
When somebody dies,

277
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,680
it's normal for them to take on death's colors.

278
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,780
But this guy's lips and his nails aren't purple,

279
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,980
they're pink.

280
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,280
That's proof he died of potassium cyanide poisoning.

281
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,380
Potassium cyanide is different from other poisons is that

282
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,880
when you drink it,

283
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,180
it destroys the electron transmission in the cells.

284
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:41,380
And the oxygen in the blood gets circulated without being used.

285
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,680
That's why the complexion takes on a healthy color.

286
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,780
Also, there's the smell of almond coming out his mouth

287
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,280
that points at potassium cyanide poisoning.

288
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,680
Officer, is what he said true?

289
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,180
Yes.

290
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,080
And there is an almond smell.

291
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,380
This boy is right,

292
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,380
it's almost certain he died of potassium cyanide poison.

293
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,680
Hey, you.

294
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,980
You seem to know a lot about this case.

295
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,080
You weren't anywhere near the victim's chair

296
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,680
when it happened, were you?

297
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,780
No way.

298
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,280
I was sitting in the very front row of the block

299
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,680
across the aisle from him.

300
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,680
The first row of the next block...

301
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,780
That's right, I was sitting three seats away from you!

302
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,680
Mouri, is that true?

303
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,880
Well, you see...

304
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,180
I was concentrating on the play,

305
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,580
so I didn't notice who was sitting in the other seats.

306
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:34,280
Is there anybody else who can prove you were there?

307
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,480
Let's see now...

308
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,880
Just ask him!

309
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,880
I was sitting right next to that kid with the glasses!

310
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,580
Is that right, Conan?

311
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,080
Yes, I think so.

312
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,580
But still, I got this funny feeling

313
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,780
that I know you from some place.

314
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,780
Who are you anyway?

315
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,580
Don't tell me you've already forgotten about me?

316
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,180
I'm so disappointed!

317
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:03,080
After all the trouble I went through to get back here.

318
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,680
It's me, Shinichi Kudo!

319
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,380
What?

320
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,380
The kid with the eye glasses called me.

321
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,680
That's why I came to see your play, sweetie!

322
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,280
Isn't that right, kid?

323
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,180
Aren't you...

324
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,880
Huh?

325
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,180
Heiji, what are you doing?

326
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,580
Kazuha?

327
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,680
I told you not to come here!

328
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,980
You put powder on your face and changed your hair style.

329
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,480
Are you going to put on a kabuki show for us here?

330
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,980
No, you've got everything wrong.

331
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,080
Take a good look!

332
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,980
I'm not Heiji, I'm Shinichi Kudo!

333
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,980
What kind of joke is this anyway?

334
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,880
Oh, I give up!

335
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,880
You're right, it's just a joke!

336
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,980
I thought I'd dress up Iike Kudo and surprise everybody.

337
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,580
But I guess it didn't work!

338
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,180
Good grief. What's up with you anyway?

339
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,180
One fool is enough and that's Mouri.

340
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,180
Well, it's just a joke.

341
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,580
Darn it.

342
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,080
All I wanted to do was pretend to be Kudo,

343
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,780
and sit next to the real mini Kudo.

344
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,080
So that Ran would see us.

345
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,680
And maybe she wouldn't be suspicious anymore.

346
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,680
My plan was perfect

347
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,380
and that darn Kazuha spoiled everything!

348
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,180
At any rate, let's continue the investigation.

349
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,880
So did the deceased Mr. Kamata buy his own drink?

350
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,680
No, he didn't.

351
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,980
I bought the drinks.

352
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,680
From that concession.

353
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,480
I bought four drinks

354
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,980
and took them to my friends who were waiting at their seats.

355
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,980
After that, I handed the drinks to Mitani

356
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,980
and I went to the restroom, isn't that right?

357
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,080
Yes.

358
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,380
So Mr. Mitani, did you give the victim his drink?

359
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,380
No.

360
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,880
Mai asked me to pass out the drinks and...

361
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,580
I'm going to the restroom, could you take these?

362
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,480
Are you going now?

363
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,380
Then, you'd better hurry, Mai.

364
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,280
! think it's about to start.

365
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,680
Really?

366
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,780
I have less than a minute left. I'd better hurry.

367
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,580
Hurry!

368
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,880
Let's see, Mai has an iced coffee and...

369
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,180
Mine's orange juice.

370
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,380
Orange juice.

371
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,380
Here.

372
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,280
Thank you.

373
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,280
Kohei, you're having iced coffee, aren't you?

374
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,580
Yes.

375
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,880
So she was the one who handed him his drink.

376
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,280
What's that supposed to mean?

377
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,880
You're the one who picked out which cup was his!

378
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,480
Excuse me

379
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,280
but could you tell me

380
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,980
what is your relationship with Mr. Kamata?

381
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,780
We all graduated from this high school

382
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,480
and we were in the same drama club.

383
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,880
We all coincidentally got jobs in the same company.

384
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,380
And it's become a tradition for us

385
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,280
to come see the play at the school festival.

386
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,380
I can't believe something Iike this would happen to Kamata.

387
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,580
And he was so excited that his doctrine

388
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,780
might finally be recognized.

389
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,480
Yes, that's right.

390
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,980
But, Ms. Mai,

391
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,680
I don't understand why

392
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,380
you went to buy four drinks all by yourself.

393
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,980
Isn't it pretty hard to carry four drinks by yourself?

394
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,580
Well, it was crowded

395
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,180
so I told the others to go and get the seats.

396
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,680
Kamata came back later and...

397
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,280
Mai, can you manage all those drinks alone?

398
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,280
I'll help you.

399
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,680
Thank you.

400
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,380
Huh?

401
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,880
I'm sorry, but I'll wait at my seat.

402
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,080
What?

403
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:32,380
Kamata suddenly got pale and went back to his seat.

404
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,780
He got pale?

405
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,580
I wonder what happened?

406
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,780
Maybe it was because he saw me working at the concession.

407
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,180
Ayako, is that you?

408
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,380
You're a student here, too?

409
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,680
I knew it! I knew I recognized you from somewhere.

410
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,480
Do you know her?

411
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,480
Yes.

412
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,680
Her father is the director of the hospital we work in.

413
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:58,480
Then, the person who put the drinks in this group's cups was...

414
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,880
It was me.

415
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,280
I see.

416
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,080
Now, we have all the suspects!

417
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,380
Just hold on a minute!

418
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,780
Kohei and I both drank iced coffee!

419
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,180
If I put the poison in his drink,

420
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,980
I'd give him his drink personally

421
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,180
so that I wouldn't drink it by mistake!

422
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:20,380
But if you poisoned both and then just didn't drink your own...

423
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,280
I drank every drop!

424
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,580
Maybe you poured yours down the toilet?

425
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,880
Didn't I tell you

426
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,780
I left all the drinks and then went to the restroom?

427
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,380
When I got back, the play had already started

428
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,680
and I never left my seat after that.

429
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,480
All I did was pass out the drinks,

430
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,480
I didn't have time to put any poison in it.

431
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,280
Neither did I!

432
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,180
But you did have time to open the lid and look inside, didn't you?

433
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,580
We didn't have to open them up.

434
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,180
The contents of each cup was written on the lid.

435
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:56,380
Besides, the iced coffee had tubs of gum syrup and milk on them.

436
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,880
Then, someone could have brought poisoned gum syrup or milk

437
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,080
and switched them later.

438
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,780
Then, he would have died as soon as he drank it!

439
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,380
Potassium cyanide causes instant death!

440
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,280
But Kamata's cup was almost completely empty!

441
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,080
It's still not clear what trick the killer used

442
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,480
to poison Mr. Kamata's drink,

443
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,780
nonetheless,

444
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:26,780
it's clear one of you is the killer.

445
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,440
Next Conan's Hint:

446
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,620
"Ice"

447
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,520
In the next episode, he will finally appear!

448
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,420
No, he won't come! I'm good enough!

449
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,600
That's not true!
