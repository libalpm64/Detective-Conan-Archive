Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,090
A pension in the highlands at the end of summer.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,090
An impossible crime involving a one-path road.

He sees through the one and only truth.

Thank you for coming all this way to an inconvenient place like this.

00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:11,950
I'm sorry.

-Sure. -Sure.

17
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:27,350
Is it true that you are running the pension together with your brother?

18
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,450
Oh, no.

I see.

22
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,250
Come to think of it, Shiro...

23
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,950
We're going to be delivering watermelon to dad, aren't we?

24
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,250
No, isn't our priority to see our guests off first?

25
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,450
Are we going to stop over somewhere?

26
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,950
If so, then...

27
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,150
I would like to go to the restroom.

28
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,150
Yes, of course.

29
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,450
It's right over there across the bridge.

30

Oh, that's just great.

31
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,950
Come on, dad, you're drinking too much.

32
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,150

Well, well, this is indeed a fine vase.

Are you a ceramic artist, village head?

38
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,750
No, I'm just doing it to kill time because I live alone.

39
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,550
But, I got hurt yesterday and can't do anything today.

40
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,950
That's right. Father, this was taken from our field.

41
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,450
I hope you like it.

42
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,550
Are you trying to humor me?

43
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,050
Father, Shiro's doing no such thing.

44
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,550
Despite my strongly going against him marrying into his wife's family,

45
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,950
he went along and did so.

46
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,850
Listen, Shiro.

47
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,150
I have no intention of lending you money.

48

Take that and get out of here.

I'm sorry you had to see something so unsightly.

I'm very sorry.

51
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,450
I guess he just happened to be in a bad mood today.

52
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,150
No, he's always like that.

53
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,950
On top of being stubborn, his way of thinking is old fashioned.

Hello.

Hi, Aiko.

59
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,550
Would you like me to pay for ours in advance?

60
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,050
Thanks, but I'll come to collect it next time,

61
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,650
because I'd like to be meticulous with money matters.

62
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,150
How do you do, Aiko?

63
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,550
I am Kogoro Mouri, a private detective.

64
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,250
I'm planning to spend the night here,

65
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,150
and my room is... let me see...

66
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,950
I'm sorry, I've got to make deliveries,

67
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,250
so if you will excuse me?

68

The beauty of the healing forest.

69
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,050
My hat.

Be careful.

71
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,650
Don't go into the river because it's dangerous.

72
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,250
I'll go get it for you.

73
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,550
Thank God. I've got it, Miss.

74
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,250
Thank you so much.

75
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,250
I'm sure glad you didn't get wet?

76
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,350
But, you slacks got wet, Mr. Murakami.

77
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,150
No problem. But, more than that,

78
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,350
now everybody knows that I can't swim.

79
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,650
See you, then. We'll pick mountain vegetables for dinner.

80
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,350
We're going to go.

81
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,550

83
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,650
Thank you.

84
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,950
Here's your additional order.

85
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,350
Thank you always.

86
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,750
Is a tour group or something spending the night here or something today?

87
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,750
Oh, well sort of.

88
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,550
Hey.

89
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,850
There's no more beer. Beer.

90
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,350
Gosh, dad.

91
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,650
How dare he get drunk and sack out.

92
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,350
Mr. Murakami, did you pick mountain vegetables?

93
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,650
Yes, well sort of.

94
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,550
I remembered that I had something to do

95
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,650
that I came back early.

96
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,950
I see.

97
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,950
But please rest assured.

98
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,850
My younger brother's taking care of gathering the mountain vegetables.

99
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,950
Now, where is this now?

100
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,150
I tell you, dad...

101
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:14,350
Mouri Detective Agency.

102
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,250
What did you say? The village head had been killed?

103
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,450
I'm back.

104
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,050
Yes. I understand,

105
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,750
I'll be right over, yes.

106
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,850
"Yoji Midorikawa (54)" -You're Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

107
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,450
"Police Officer" -I'm Midorikawa who is stationed here.

108
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,850
Good work. I'd like to see the murder site.

109
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:43,850
Yes, sir. This way please.

110
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,650
-Father. -Father.

111
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,550
A paper knife, so this is the murder weapon.

112
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,650
R.M... initials?

113
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,650
It's the belongings of the village head.

114
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,050
Judging from the looks of the corpse,

115
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,550
the killer was in the study

116
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,650
and probably stabbed the village head from the front.

117
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,050
Since the papers were scattered,

118
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,250
does that mean that the killer was looking for something?

119
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,650
About the method of entry,

120
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,150
aside from the front entrance,

121
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,750
all the other places are locked from the inside.

122
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:28,950
Aiko, please give us the details of when you found the village head.

123
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,950
Yes, sir.

124
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,250
If I remember correctly, at about 5 minutes to 4,

125
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,150
I came here to collect payment for milk.

126
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,950
I had him stamp this notebook back then.

127
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,050
And after that?

128
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,350
On my way to Shiro's pension,

129
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,950
I heard someone scream,

130
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,150
so came back here immediately,

131
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,150
and found the village head.

132
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,450
And, what time did you hear the scream?

133
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,050
Four o'clock.

134
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,850
I was in the middle of making my round of patrol.

135
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,050
I arrived at the village head's house a while after Aiko,

136
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,250
which was about 5 minutes after 4:00 pm.

137
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,850
Which means,

138
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,950
he was killed only a few minutes after Aiko left his house.

139
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:15,350
In other words, the killer seems to have been here

140
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,150
when Aiko came to collect the money.

141
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:24,450
Pops, his money and credit cards haven't been stolen.

142
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,050
Besides, the things on his desk just seem to have fallen on the floor,

143
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,450
that it doesn't seem to be a robbery case...

144
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,550
Ouch.

145
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,350
I tell you, don't touch things without permission.

146
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,350
It seems that the killer came to see the village head,

147
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,650
encountered a problem and impulsively stabbed him.

148
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,050
By the way, where were you two at 4:00 pm sharp?

149
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,950
I was already back at the pension.

150
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,650
I was probably walking along the one path road.

151
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,750
Can someone prove that for you?

152
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,650
Well...

153
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:02,350
At around 4:10 pm when Mr. Murakami got a call from Aiko,

154
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,150
he was already here at the pension.

155
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,550
And, Mr. Tateshiba came back

156
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,050
while Mr. Murakami was on the phone, remember?

157
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,650
And, besides...

158
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,550
Why would we want to kill our father?

159
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,450
It takes at least an hour to get from father's house

160
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,750
to this pension here on foot.

161
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,350
If by car it only takes about 5 minutes,

162
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,750
but back then I went out on foot.

163
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,250
The car was parked at the pension right through.

164
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,150
Any other way of transportation?

165
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,450
There is no other way.

166
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,650
There is only one road leading to the pension and besides,

167
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,250
it's a dead end street. Precipitous mountains surround the path.

168
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,750
That means it would be impossible to return to the pension

169
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,650
from the village head's house in 10 minutes.

170
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,850
Which means that the killer is Aiko?

171
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,550
No. Judging from the wound,

172
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:52,750
the killer would have been splattered with a large amount of blood.

173
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,450
I see.

174
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,250
In other words, it would've been impossible for anyone here

175
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,350
to commit the crime.

176
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,750
The culprit is most likely a third party,

177
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,050
who broke in to steal something

178
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,850
and ended up committing a murder.

179
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,950
Something's not right.

180
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,150
Something.

181
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,300
Will you show me that notebook?

182
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,300
You mean this?

183
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,400
Sure, sonny.

184
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
This is...

185
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,800
All the documents have to do with the village heads work

186
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,300
and are all dated today.

187
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,800
But...

188
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,250
Why?

189
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,350
Mr. Mouri.

190
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,250
Is it alright if we go back to the pension once?

191
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,350
I don't see why not.

192
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,050
The clay has decreased.

193
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,750
The village head whose hand was hurt couldn't have used the clay.

194
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,550
Besides, the rope that was on top is also gone.

195
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,550
I get it.

196
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,150
What's up, Pops?

197
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,150
-Mr. Mouri? -Dad.

198
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,050
It's nothing, I just figured out who the killer is.

199
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,050
The killer is among us.

200
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,460
But... you just finished saying a while ago

201
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,060
that it would be impossible for anyone here to commit the crime.

202
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,660
As far as Aiko is concerned,

203
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,260
she was immediately deleted from the list of suspects.

204
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,660
The killer would've had to get rid of the clothes

205
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,660
that was splattered with blood.

206
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,760
But, she did not change clothes,

207
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,960
nor did she have time to get rid of the blood

208
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,660
that would've splattered on her.

209
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,360
Shiro and Kinji have both changed clothes.

210
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,960
We both changed clothes because we got dirty picking mountain vegetables.

211
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,960
Either way, if one of the two were to be the killer,

212
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,760
how was he able to get back to the pension in 10 minutes?

213
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,260
He went down the river.

214
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,060
If go downstream the Tsunakawa

215
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,360
that flows near the village head's house and the pension.

216
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,060
Well, it'd be possible to come back to the pension in 2 to 3 minutes.

217
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,860
But, there is no scaffold in that area where you can tie a boat to.

218
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,360
No, there is none. Moreover, since this was murder committed on impulse,

219
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,260
no boat was prepared beforehand either.

220
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,960
Are you saying that the killer swam down the river?

221
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,960
Then, I'm counted out because I can't swim.

222
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,460
Then did Kinji do it?

223
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:54,360
-Don't be ridiculous! -Well, let me finish.

224
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:02,060
Most probably after the killer killed the village head on impulse,

225
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,460
he snapped back to himself

226
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,060
and realized that a lot of blood had splattered on him.

227
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,560
Therefore, he figured he had to get out

228
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,560
of the village head's residence as soon as possible

229
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,260
and wash off the blood from himself.

230
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,560
The method he thought of

231
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,860
was to use the clay and rope that was left on the dirt floor.

232
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,560
The clay and rope, but how?

233
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,060
First the killer takes off his slacks that was splattered with blood.

234
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:33,160
He then washed his slacks lightly at the water basin of the dirt floor,

235
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,260
taking the clay and rope with him.

236
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,460
He then turned his wet slacks inside out,

237
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,760
smearing clay on the inside of his slacks.

238
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,160
He turns his slacks right side out again,

239
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,960
then tied the hem of each side of his slacks with the rope.

240
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,660
Next, he holds the waist part of the slacks, filling it with air.

241
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,860
Then, he jumps off the bridge, into the river.

242
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:01,760
The slacks that inflated served as a float,

243
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,560
and the killer headed downstream.

244
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,260
Like a child usually plays when taking a bath

245
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,960
by filling the towel up with air.

246
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,960
It's the same principle.

247
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:19,360
Clay keeps water from entering the slacks through the seams.

248
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,660
All the killer had to do was leave the rest up to the flow.

249
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,460
Then he would reach the bank of the river beside the pension.

250
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:29,260
Almost all the blood that's splattered on his slacks would wash off too.

251
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,760
After arriving, the killer quickly changes clothes

252
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,760
and appears before us as if nothing had happened.

253
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,660
So, which one of them is the killer?

254
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,860
Before that, Aiko...

255
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,960
Yes.

256
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,960
We will be taking that notebook as evidence,

257
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,960
so please collect what you have to from Mr. Murakami.

258
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,060
Why, at a time like this?

259
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,960
Could you stamp it then...

260
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,860
It seems that you've realized what I'm trying to get at.

261
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,260
That notebook, Mr. Murakami...

262
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,960
is the very thing that is evidence of you being the killer.

263
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,160
-What? -What?

264
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:34,160
Please closely compare the stamps of Ryuzo and Shiro.

265
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,060
Their stamps are interchange?

266
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,260
-What? -What?

267
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:46,060
Look. Ryuzo's seat up to last month is stamped nicely but...

268
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,660
this month a part of the outer circle was chipped off.

269
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,660
You're right.

270
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,460
Shiro's is,

271
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,760
until last month the outer circle of the stamp was chipped off, but...

272
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,760
the stamp for this month is perfectly rounded with no chips.

273
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,960
I see.

274
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,060
Taking a good look,

275
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,260
it's obvious that the two stamps are interchange?

276
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,460
Right.

277
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,760
In other words, Shiro,

278
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,360
that serves as infallible evidence

279
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,660
that you were at the village head's house when the murder took place.

280
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:25,560
Shiro visited the village head's house bringing his own seal with him,

281
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,460
but got into an argument with the village head.

282
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,160
Since the stamps of both men are involved,

283
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,560
they must've argued on money matters.

284
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:40,560
Then, one of them threw the papers that were on the desk onto the floor,

285
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,960
and this was when their stamps interchanged.

286
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,860
No... It did not interchange today.

287
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,060
I'm sure it was the other day.

288
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,360
That's highly unlikely.

289
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,260
The stamps were interchanged today

290
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,960
just before Aiko came here.

291
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,960
The papers that are scattered on the floor

292
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,760
are all stamped with today's date on them.

293
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,760
Moreover, that stamp is exactly the same

294
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:08,060
as the one the village had been using up to last month.

295
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,960
In other words, out of all the things he stamped his seal on today,

296
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,160
the only time he stamped a different seal

297
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,460
is when Aiko came to collect payment.

298
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,160
He probably stamped a different seal just today.

299
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:25,860
Being that he holds an important position as the village head,

300
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,360
he would never suddenly change his seal.

301
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,860
Besides, whether the seal is real or fake,

302
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,860
as well as the fingerprints on the seal can easily be verified.

303
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,060
-This could never serve as evidence. -Mr. Murakami.

304
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:44,560
Conan told me that before you went mountain vegetable picking,

305
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,360
you stamped your seal for the liquor man who came to make delivery.

306
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:54,060
If we check which seal that was, then...

307
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,260
It's not true, is it, Shiro?

308
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:06,360
Why would you have to kill our father?

309
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,960
Say something, Shiro!

310
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,960
Tell me that it's not true!

311
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,660
Father hated me.

312
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,760
I was always being compared with my kid brother

313
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,160
who excelled in everything.

314
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,560
Shiro.

315
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,360
Financial woes because of the sluggish economy.

316
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,560
I needed money badly

317
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,860
so I went to ask him for financial aid.

318
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,660
Please, father.

319
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,160
At least be my warranter.

320
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,860
Enough! When I say I can't, I can't!

321
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,760
Hello, village head,

322
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,960
it's sure hot today too, isn't it?

323
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,460
You're still there brooding. You're nothing but trouble.

324
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,360
You should have left this house instead of Kinji!

325
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,260
That one phrase...

326
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,160
triggered all the anger I felt towards father and I exploded.

327
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,560
And,

328
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,560
I quickly wiped my fingerprints off the knife,

329
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,260
picked up the IOU and the seal

330
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,560
and left the room.

331
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,860
The rest is just as Mr. Mouri had explained.

332
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,660
Shiro.

333
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,760
Shiro.

334
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,760
Though it was a trick, you thought out a way to go downstream,

335
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,060
despite not being able to swim.

336
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,960
Therefore, don't you think

337
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,060
that there may have been another way to get around

338
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,560
the ill feelings you had against your father?

339
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,360
Whether you make an effort to find a way or not,

340
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,160
is what divides fate.

341
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,760
This is supposed to be a Healing Forest and yet.

342
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,660
Is pops up?

343
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,460
He's sulky and just pretending to sleep.

344
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,560
He's upset because Aiko didn't come to see him off.

345
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,760
She can't help it because she's working today and then.

346
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,360
Mr. Mouri!

347
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,760
Mr. Mouri.

348
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,460
Conan! Ran!

349
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,760
- It's Aiko. -It's Aiko.

350
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,260
Aiko!

351
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,860
My beautiful Aiko!

352
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:48,160
Please come again for a relaxing tour again someday.

353
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,060
I'll give you my word that I'll come again someday!

354
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:54,960
The only thing that can heal me is your smile!

355
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,860
We've awakened a sleeping child.

356
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,440
Next Conan's Hint:

357
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,900
"Autograph square"

358
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,800
Idol Yoko appears in the next episode.

359
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:41,670
Yoko, long time no see.
