2
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:08,792
Dad was suddenly invited to a party.

3
00:00:08,792 --> 00:00:13,091
That's why Pops' Sunday suit is hanging outside.

4
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:15,491
Right. And this is done.

5
00:00:17,992 --> 00:00:19,191
What is wrong?

6
00:00:20,892 --> 00:00:24,691
I'd like to give Shinichi a better tie.

7
00:00:31,691 --> 00:00:35,092
What're you blushing for, Conan?

8
00:00:35,092 --> 00:00:37,192
Well...

9
00:00:37,192 --> 00:00:38,592
Where's Pops?

10
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:40,192
At the barber.

11
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,692
He's late, isn't he?

12
00:00:41,692 --> 00:00:43,991
I'll go get him then.

13
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:50,692
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

The two who confront each other is a mystery.

00:00:52,892 --> 00:00:54,491
What is the secret of the strange eye-witness

16
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:56,292
who was at the site, but didn't see what happened?

17
00:00:56,292 --> 00:00:58,092
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:00,092
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

00:03:01,113 --> 00:03:03,113
"Open"

23
00:03:03,113 --> 00:03:04,513
Hold it!

24
00:03:05,913 --> 00:03:07,813
Wait up!

25
00:03:12,513 --> 00:03:13,613
I'm closing already.

26
00:03:13,613 --> 00:03:16,113
Sorry, I'm in a rush.

27
00:03:20,413 --> 00:03:22,713
There's another customer here too.

28
00:03:22,713 --> 00:03:24,513
Please. If you do me first,

29
00:03:24,513 --> 00:03:26,413
I promise to patronize you shop from here on.

30
00:03:26,413 --> 00:03:27,713
All right.

31
00:03:27,713 --> 00:03:30,913
Since he's fast asleep, I'll do you first.

32
00:03:30,913 --> 00:03:32,313
Thanks.

33
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,713
Hot, hot!

34
00:03:35,713 --> 00:03:37,113
One moment please.

35
00:03:41,313 --> 00:03:44,213
I wonder what kind of dishes are going to be served at today's party?

36
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:46,613
French cuisine would be just great.

37
00:03:48,313 --> 00:03:50,313
Chinese food's not bad either,

38
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,713
shark's fin and Peking duck.

39
00:03:54,613 --> 00:03:59,013
It's the shuttle bus of the swimming school that opened recently.

40
00:04:01,513 --> 00:04:03,913
Hei. It's a noisy like always.

41
00:04:05,013 --> 00:04:06,413
It's so noisy.

42
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:10,613
I'll sue them for disturbing the public. Darn!

43
00:04:11,913 --> 00:04:15,513
I wish they'd hurry and go somewhere else.

44
00:04:15,513 --> 00:04:18,513
Cut out the noise, cut out the noise. Darn.

45
00:04:22,613 --> 00:04:24,413
Thank God...

46
00:04:26,913 --> 00:04:29,113
What?

47
00:04:29,113 --> 00:04:30,313
What is it?

48
00:04:37,013 --> 00:04:39,213
He's dead.

49
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:41,113
Ebihara?

50
00:04:43,513 --> 00:04:45,413
Pops!

51
00:04:45,413 --> 00:04:46,913
You weren't at the usual shop,

52
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:48,313
so I came searching for you!

53
00:04:48,313 --> 00:04:51,213
Conan! Didn't you see anyone suspicious?

54
00:04:51,213 --> 00:04:52,913
No, I didn't.

55
00:04:52,913 --> 00:04:54,713
Is anything wrong?

56
00:04:54,713 --> 00:04:56,113
Please call the police.

57
00:04:56,113 --> 00:04:58,713
Yes, sir.

58
00:04:58,713 --> 00:05:00,113
-Pops. -Hey! Conan.

59
00:05:00,113 --> 00:05:02,113
Children out...

60
00:05:02,113 --> 00:05:03,213
This is...

61
00:05:05,713 --> 00:05:06,813
Hey.

62
00:05:10,013 --> 00:05:12,613
Okay. I'm going to fly this one more time.

63
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:14,213
Hey, Genta!

64
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,713
Conan.

65
00:05:15,713 --> 00:05:18,013
Didn't anyone come out of here?

66
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:20,513
Nobody came out!

67
00:05:20,513 --> 00:05:22,613
Is anything wrong?

68
00:05:24,713 --> 00:05:26,913
I wonder if something happened?

69
00:05:30,713 --> 00:05:32,113
Darn!

70
00:05:32,113 --> 00:05:34,513
A murder was committed right behind me.

71
00:05:34,513 --> 00:05:35,813
Audacious dare-devil.

72
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:38,513
Who on earth are you?

73
00:05:38,513 --> 00:05:42,213
I'm the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri.

74
00:05:42,213 --> 00:05:43,713
You mean that famous...

75
00:05:43,713 --> 00:05:45,513
Exactly.

76
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,213
Conan, is it another case?

77
00:05:49,213 --> 00:05:53,013
Hey, children aren't allowed inside!

78
00:05:53,013 --> 00:05:54,413
That goes for you too.

79
00:05:54,413 --> 00:05:56,213
Yes, you're right.

80
00:05:57,713 --> 00:06:01,013
And, when I turned to look surprised at the loud noise,

81
00:06:01,013 --> 00:06:04,313
the owner of this shop, Mr. Ebihara was lying on the floor.

82
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:06,513
He was already dead.

83
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:07,913
I see.

84
00:06:07,913 --> 00:06:12,413
Your ears heard every detail of what happened, right?

85
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,213
Yes, sir.

86
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:17,013
So, what you heard was this fall?

87
00:06:17,013 --> 00:06:18,413
Yes, sir.

88
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:21,013
It was on the cash register counter.

89
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,213
It probably fell

90
00:06:22,213 --> 00:06:25,813
when Mr. Ebihara's arm touched it as he collapsed.

91
00:06:25,813 --> 00:06:27,113
I see.

92
00:06:28,713 --> 00:06:34,213
Why is only that dart on the ground such a distance away?

93
00:06:34,213 --> 00:06:35,913
Mr. Noda, was it?

94
00:06:35,913 --> 00:06:38,413
You say you were fast asleep

95
00:06:38,413 --> 00:06:40,913
when Mr. Mouri walked in here?

96
00:06:40,913 --> 00:06:41,913
"Masao Noda (43)" -Yes, sir...

97
00:06:41,913 --> 00:06:46,613
That's why I didn't notice Mr. Mouri coming here at all.

98
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:49,213
At around what time did you come here?

99
00:06:49,213 --> 00:06:52,813
Well... since I was looking around or a shop that was opened

100
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:55,013
that I'm not sure what time it was.

101
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:57,113
But, the incident occurred

102
00:06:57,113 --> 00:07:00,013
only several minutes after I entered the shop.

103
00:07:00,013 --> 00:07:01,913
We got report of the incident by phone

104
00:07:01,913 --> 00:07:04,813
at the police at around 6:36 pm,

105
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:09,613
so Mr. Mouri would've entered the shop around 6:30 pm.

106
00:07:09,613 --> 00:07:12,613
Around what time did you come?

107
00:07:12,613 --> 00:07:15,613
At around 6:20 pm.

108
00:07:15,613 --> 00:07:18,413
Only, because of daily exhaustion,

109
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:21,813
I fell asleep as soon as I sat in the chair.

110
00:07:23,313 --> 00:07:26,213
And, are you sure that no one went in or out

111
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,513
of this shop on the day the incident occurred?

112
00:07:28,513 --> 00:07:29,813
Yes, sir.

113
00:07:29,813 --> 00:07:31,013
Just about that time,

114
00:07:31,013 --> 00:07:35,013
the shuttle bus of the swimming school was in front of the shop.

115
00:07:35,013 --> 00:07:37,213
I think it would be impossible for anyone to go in and out of the shop

116
00:07:37,213 --> 00:07:38,813
without being seen by anyone.

117
00:07:38,813 --> 00:07:42,113
I didn't seen anybody come out of the shop too.

118
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:45,013
There's no one who went out of the back door either?

119
00:07:45,013 --> 00:07:47,613
No. Nobody did.

120
00:07:47,613 --> 00:07:51,713
We were playing all the while at the vacant lot in back.

121
00:07:51,713 --> 00:07:54,313
The culprit probably threw the dart

122
00:07:54,313 --> 00:07:57,713
from outside the shop and killed Mr. Ebihara.

123
00:07:57,713 --> 00:07:59,113
From outside?

124
00:07:59,113 --> 00:08:01,713
Just at that time the shuttle bus of the swimming school

125
00:08:01,713 --> 00:08:05,513
was playing music so loud that it was nothing but noise.

126
00:08:05,513 --> 00:08:09,613
I'm sure the owner opened the window to complain.

127
00:08:09,613 --> 00:08:10,913
So, the culprit took this opportunity

128
00:08:10,913 --> 00:08:13,913
to throw the dart at him.

129
00:08:13,913 --> 00:08:17,213
Right. The culprit was probably hiding

130
00:08:17,213 --> 00:08:19,113
in the alley in front of the shop.

131
00:08:19,113 --> 00:08:21,813
From the alley to here is about 4 m,

132
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:24,713
so a dart would make its mark considering the distance.

133
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:28,413
It seems that poison was smeared on the tip of the dart.

134
00:08:28,413 --> 00:08:32,813
I wonder why Mr. Ebihara was wearing a wig?

135
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:37,013
It's true that he doesn't look like he needs a wig.

136
00:08:37,013 --> 00:08:38,613
What do you think, Mr. Noda?

137
00:08:38,613 --> 00:08:39,913
I wonder...

138
00:08:41,913 --> 00:08:44,713
A reason for wearing a wig...

139
00:08:46,413 --> 00:08:50,213
Mr. Ebihara is wearing a strange sweatshirt, isn't he?

140
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:53,913
That's a sweatshirt that the members of the darts bar

141
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:56,313
Darts Lovers Club that was established in the neighborhood wore.

142
00:08:56,313 --> 00:08:59,213
Darts Lover Club?

143
00:08:59,213 --> 00:09:02,113
-Are you a member too? -Yes, sir.

144
00:09:02,113 --> 00:09:06,313
One who patronizes the darts bar is killed with a dart.

145
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:07,813
It could be that the culprit is someone

146
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,913
who also frequents the darts bar.

147
00:09:14,613 --> 00:09:17,713
They both frequent the darts bar.

148
00:09:17,713 --> 00:09:19,713
"Nozomu Shimazaki (28)" -Mr. Nozomu Shimazaki who works

149
00:09:19,713 --> 00:09:22,713
for a linen service company,

150
00:09:22,713 --> 00:09:26,113
"Tatsutaro Koike (45)" -and Mr. Tatsutaro Koike who works

151
00:09:26,113 --> 00:09:27,913
at a pharmacy in the neighborhood.

152
00:09:27,913 --> 00:09:30,613
I hear that you got into an argument

153
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:33,313
with Mr. Ebihara at the darts bar last night.

154
00:09:33,313 --> 00:09:35,813
No...

155
00:09:35,813 --> 00:09:37,113
It's because that old man Ebihara

156
00:09:37,113 --> 00:09:39,913
started saying this and that's that weren't true.

157
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,113
What kind of this and that's?

158
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:43,313
Well...

159
00:09:43,313 --> 00:09:46,513
Mr. Ebihara started accusing

160
00:09:46,513 --> 00:09:48,613
Mr. Shimazaki of embezzling money from the company,

161
00:09:48,613 --> 00:09:51,213
so Mr. Shimazaki got angry and grabbed him by the neck,

162
00:09:51,213 --> 00:09:54,713
so all I did was go in between them to stop them.

163
00:09:54,713 --> 00:09:57,113
You gotta be joking! You went pale too,

164
00:09:57,113 --> 00:10:01,113
when he accused you of making up for the red of your store

165
00:10:01,113 --> 00:10:02,513
by putting goods on the black market.

166
00:10:02,513 --> 00:10:04,413
No way...

167
00:10:07,113 --> 00:10:10,913
Noda, you're still coughing?

168
00:10:10,913 --> 00:10:12,813
Why aren't you wearing a mask?

169
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:14,713
I must've dropped it somewhere.

170
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:18,413
Mr. Noda, although you're standing there like this has nothing to with you,

171
00:10:18,413 --> 00:10:21,613
but you borrowed money from old man Ebihara too, didn't you?

172
00:10:21,613 --> 00:10:26,413
Right, Ebihara said that he lent you money to manage your shop.

173
00:10:26,413 --> 00:10:27,913
Well, how about it?

174
00:10:27,913 --> 00:10:29,813
It's true I borrowed money from him,

175
00:10:29,813 --> 00:10:31,913
but it wasn't all that much.

176
00:10:31,913 --> 00:10:33,113
I wonder about that.

177
00:10:33,113 --> 00:10:36,513
You were at the barbershop on the day of the incident, weren't you?

178
00:10:36,513 --> 00:10:38,513
Doesn't that make you really suspicious?

179
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:42,613
No, Mr. Noda was sitting in the chair

180
00:10:42,613 --> 00:10:45,813
next to mine at the time Mr. Ebihara was murdered.

181
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:47,613
He couldn't have committed the murder.

182
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:50,313
Who are you? Acting like some big shot.

183
00:10:50,313 --> 00:10:53,413
I'm the famed Detective Kogoro Mouri.

184
00:10:53,413 --> 00:10:56,213
-What? -What? The Sleeping Kogoro.

185
00:10:56,213 --> 00:10:59,913
By the way, where were you two

186
00:10:59,913 --> 00:11:01,613
at around 6:30 pm in the evening?

187
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:03,213
Mr. Koike, first.

188
00:11:03,213 --> 00:11:05,313
I was at the shop.

189
00:11:05,313 --> 00:11:08,313
Do you have anyone that will testify that for you?

190
00:11:08,313 --> 00:11:10,113
I think not.

191
00:11:10,113 --> 00:11:11,713
There were no customers

192
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:15,213
and my wife is the kitchen preparing dinner.

193
00:11:15,213 --> 00:11:17,113
So no one else?

194
00:11:17,113 --> 00:11:20,813
But, I didn't do it. Please believe me.

195
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,013
How about you, Mr. Shimazaki?

196
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:24,513
At about 6:30 pm

197
00:11:24,513 --> 00:11:26,713
I was still in the midst of making deliveries.

198
00:11:26,713 --> 00:11:29,313
That's right, I stopped over at a service station.

199
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,313
A service station?

200
00:11:31,313 --> 00:11:34,413
Then, the employee there would remember you if we want to confirm it?

201
00:11:34,413 --> 00:11:37,013
No, it was a self-service gas station

202
00:11:37,013 --> 00:11:38,613
so I didn't see any employee.

203
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:40,813
But, I have the receipt.

204
00:11:43,313 --> 00:11:45,713
6:24 pm.

205
00:11:45,713 --> 00:11:48,513
Even if I were to come here from that service station at top speed,

206
00:11:48,513 --> 00:11:50,613
it would take 30 minutes.

207
00:11:50,613 --> 00:11:52,913
I saw that man a while ago.

208
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:54,513
Where did you see him?

209
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,113
In front of this shop.

210
00:11:56,113 --> 00:11:59,313
He was just about to come out of the shop.

211
00:11:59,313 --> 00:12:01,713
What time was that?

212
00:12:01,713 --> 00:12:03,113
In the evening.

213
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:08,013
Let's see, I saw the clock through the window of the shop.

214
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:10,013
It was 5:50 pm.

215
00:12:10,013 --> 00:12:12,013
That clock...

216
00:12:13,413 --> 00:12:16,313
4:15 pm?

217
00:12:16,313 --> 00:12:19,213
What? 7:45 pm?

218
00:12:21,013 --> 00:12:24,313
That clock is a mirror image.

219
00:12:24,313 --> 00:12:26,613
So that the customers can see what time it is through the mirror.

220
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,113
I see.

221
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:30,213
So, he finally got it.

222
00:12:30,213 --> 00:12:32,513
It used to be an ordinary clock until some time ago, right?

223
00:12:32,513 --> 00:12:34,913
When did you deliver it to him?

224
00:12:34,913 --> 00:12:36,813
Oh, yeah, last night.

225
00:12:36,813 --> 00:12:40,613
Which means that the time Ayumi saw Mr. Shimazaki,

226
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:44,513
was not at 5:50 pm, but rather, 6:10 pm.

227
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:47,313
If he left here at 6:10 pm,

228
00:12:47,313 --> 00:12:50,813
he couldn't have made it to the service station by 6:24 pm.

229
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:55,713
Well, I did come here to retrieve towels.

230
00:12:55,713 --> 00:12:59,213
And, I got into an argument with him about the night before,

231
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:00,713
but I still had deliveries to make,

232
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:03,013
so I left right away.

233
00:13:03,013 --> 00:13:05,713
Just as she says, it was before 6:00 pm.

234
00:13:05,713 --> 00:13:09,413
So, since that clock is a mirror image clock,

235
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,213
it was 6:10 pm.

236
00:13:11,213 --> 00:13:14,213
Wrong. It was before 6:00 pm.

237
00:13:14,213 --> 00:13:18,313
Mr. Shimazaki, you killed Mr. Ebihara

238
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:20,213
because he accused you of embezzlement.

239
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:21,913
Don't be ridiculous.

240
00:13:21,913 --> 00:13:24,713
After leaving the shop, you hid yourself in the alley

241
00:13:24,713 --> 00:13:27,213
and killed Mr. Ebihara when he opened the window.

242
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:28,613
I could never do it, not with my skill.

243
00:13:28,613 --> 00:13:33,213
I'm the worst darts player in the Darts Lovers Club.

244
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:36,813
Right, you could do it, Mr. Koike.

245
00:13:36,813 --> 00:13:38,613
What're you talking about?

246
00:13:38,613 --> 00:13:41,313
You're the best player among all of us!

247
00:13:41,313 --> 00:13:44,213
There was poison smeared on the dart used as a murder weapon!

248
00:13:44,213 --> 00:13:45,913
Since Mr. Koike is a pharmacist,

249
00:13:45,913 --> 00:13:49,413
he could mix and make poison, couldn't he?

250
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:51,713
Don't be ridiculous.

251
00:13:51,713 --> 00:13:55,013
Mr. Koike, you're the killer!

252
00:13:55,013 --> 00:13:56,613
No!

253
00:13:56,613 --> 00:13:58,413
Which one's the killer?

254
00:13:58,413 --> 00:13:59,713
If you're a famed detective,

255
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:03,113
I wish you would clarify who it is.

256
00:14:03,113 --> 00:14:06,113
Talk about unreliability.

257
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:08,213
You guys get out of here!

258
00:14:10,613 --> 00:14:12,213
Shoots, miser!

259
00:14:12,213 --> 00:14:15,513
We're also making important testimonies, and yet!

260
00:14:15,513 --> 00:14:17,213
Right! Right!

261
00:14:20,813 --> 00:14:23,613
If the culprit got a poisoned dart ready,

262
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,913
it's obviously a planned crime.

263
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:30,913
If so, would the culprit throw the dart from this far?

264
00:14:35,913 --> 00:14:38,313
The clock is not in view from the window.

265
00:14:38,313 --> 00:14:41,513
Ayumi, where did you see the clock from?

266
00:14:43,613 --> 00:14:45,413
Let's see.

267
00:14:45,413 --> 00:14:47,013
Around here.

268
00:14:47,013 --> 00:14:48,713
That's strange,

269
00:14:48,713 --> 00:14:50,613
I can't see the clock.

270
00:14:50,613 --> 00:14:53,113
But I did see it a while ago.

271
00:14:53,113 --> 00:14:56,413
The clock was moved? But, why?

272
00:15:03,213 --> 00:15:04,513
I see.

273
00:15:04,513 --> 00:15:05,913
That's what it was.

274
00:15:06,913 --> 00:15:08,413
I got it.

275
00:15:08,413 --> 00:15:10,913
He's the culprit.

276
00:15:25,084 --> 00:15:27,184
Mr. Shimazaki and Mr. Koike,

277
00:15:27,184 --> 00:15:28,784
please come to the police station with me

278
00:15:28,784 --> 00:15:29,984
and tell us about the details.

279
00:15:29,984 --> 00:15:31,484
No.

280
00:15:37,584 --> 00:15:38,984
Please wait.

281
00:15:40,284 --> 00:15:43,784
I will solve this case right here and now.

282
00:15:43,784 --> 00:15:45,684
What?

283
00:15:45,684 --> 00:15:49,284
Are you saying that you've figured out the truth of the case?

284
00:15:49,284 --> 00:15:51,084
The fact is that the culprit

285
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:53,684
was at the shop even before I got here.

286
00:15:53,684 --> 00:15:56,384
And, he's still here.

287
00:15:57,484 --> 00:15:59,684
What?

288
00:15:59,684 --> 00:16:02,084
Yes, the culprit is...

289
00:16:02,084 --> 00:16:03,884
Mr. Noda,

290
00:16:03,884 --> 00:16:05,084
it's you.

291
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:09,984
Mr. Noda, you...

292
00:16:09,984 --> 00:16:12,784
Come on, Mr. Mouri.

293
00:16:12,784 --> 00:16:17,684
Back then, I was sitting in the chair next to you.

294
00:16:17,684 --> 00:16:21,584
When you heard something fall and turned to look,

295
00:16:21,584 --> 00:16:26,084
Mr. Noda also just got up from his chair, didn't he?

296
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:31,084
Mr. Ebihara wasn't killed when that sound was heard.

297
00:16:31,084 --> 00:16:35,584
The fact is, he was already killed when I got here.

298
00:16:35,584 --> 00:16:38,184
-What? -Don't be ridiculous.

299
00:16:38,184 --> 00:16:42,384
You met Mr. Ebihara when you came here, didn't you?

300
00:16:42,384 --> 00:16:46,484
Yes, I met a person who had disheveled hair,

301
00:16:46,484 --> 00:16:50,784
wearing a mask and wearing a Darts Lovers Club sweatshirt.

302
00:16:50,784 --> 00:16:52,884
That was Ebihara.

303
00:16:52,884 --> 00:16:56,184
No, that was you in disguise.

304
00:16:56,184 --> 00:16:57,584
Disguise?

305
00:16:57,584 --> 00:17:00,884
You quickly put on a wig and mask so as not to be recognized

306
00:17:00,884 --> 00:17:03,984
because I suddenly came bursting in here.

307
00:17:03,984 --> 00:17:09,084
Mr. Noda, you still actually have the mask with you, don't you?

308
00:17:09,084 --> 00:17:12,184
Then, where was Mr. Ebihara's dead body?

309
00:17:12,184 --> 00:17:15,184
On the chair next to me.

310
00:17:15,184 --> 00:17:16,584
An apron was put on him

311
00:17:16,584 --> 00:17:19,684
and he had a steamed towel on his face.

312
00:17:19,684 --> 00:17:21,384
What?

313
00:17:21,384 --> 00:17:25,384
Mr. Noda, after killing Mr. Ebihara in this shop,

314
00:17:25,384 --> 00:17:26,684
you were planning to walk out of this shop

315
00:17:26,684 --> 00:17:29,284
as if nothing happened.

316
00:17:29,284 --> 00:17:31,884
However, I happened to come in just then.

317
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,684
I was lead to believe that you were the owner

318
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:36,984
because of your sudden disguise.

319
00:17:36,984 --> 00:17:40,084
Therefore, you put a steamed towel

320
00:17:40,084 --> 00:17:41,284
on my face to cover my eyes

321
00:17:41,284 --> 00:17:43,784
and tried to flee out the backdoor.

322
00:17:43,784 --> 00:17:46,784
But, children were playing in the vacant lot in back,

323
00:17:46,784 --> 00:17:48,484
so you couldn't flee.

324
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,084
You couldn't go out from the front either

325
00:17:51,084 --> 00:17:54,684
because there were people there too.

326
00:17:54,684 --> 00:17:58,284
That's when the swimming school shuttle bus came by.

327
00:17:58,284 --> 00:18:00,084
A shuttle bus?

328
00:18:00,084 --> 00:18:02,884
With the loud music that was playing from the bus,

329
00:18:02,884 --> 00:18:05,084
you hit upon an idea.

330
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,684
You decided to change places with the dead body and yourself

331
00:18:08,684 --> 00:18:10,184
using this noise to your advantage.

332
00:18:11,784 --> 00:18:13,884
In the midst of that loud noise

333
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,684
most other sounds would be erased.

334
00:18:16,684 --> 00:18:20,484
You quickly lay the body down in front of the counter

335
00:18:20,484 --> 00:18:22,684
and sat yourself down in the chair in place of it.

336
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:25,184
Then, how did he drop the things

337
00:18:25,184 --> 00:18:26,884
that were on the counter?

338
00:18:26,884 --> 00:18:29,284
He threw a dart.

339
00:18:29,284 --> 00:18:32,684
There's a dart on the ground below the window.

340
00:18:32,684 --> 00:18:33,884
I see.

341
00:18:33,884 --> 00:18:37,584
Then, you pretended to wake up surprised by the loud noised

342
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:42,084
and along with me, became the first to discover the body.

343
00:18:42,084 --> 00:18:44,184
Is that so.

344
00:18:44,184 --> 00:18:45,984
But, Mr. Mouri,

345
00:18:45,984 --> 00:18:47,984
why did Mr. Noda go out of his way

346
00:18:47,984 --> 00:18:49,984
to put the dead body in the chair?

347
00:18:49,984 --> 00:18:52,584
He didn't know you were coming, did he?

348
00:18:52,584 --> 00:18:57,184
Mr. Ebihara was killed when he was sitting in the chair.

349
00:18:57,184 --> 00:19:00,684
Why would the owner of a barber shop sit in the chair?

350
00:19:00,684 --> 00:19:03,584
He was confirming the position of the clock.

351
00:19:03,584 --> 00:19:05,584
The position of the clock?

352
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:07,284
That clock was brought here today

353
00:19:07,284 --> 00:19:11,084
before the murder was committed.

354
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:14,384
I saw it from outside just a while ago...

355
00:19:14,384 --> 00:19:17,184
Conan, when did you get here?

356
00:19:17,184 --> 00:19:20,384
But, I couldn't see it from the window.

357
00:19:20,384 --> 00:19:22,084
You couldn't see it?

358
00:19:22,084 --> 00:19:23,684
Just what do you mean?

359
00:19:23,684 --> 00:19:26,884
Maybe the clock was originally somewhere around there?

360
00:19:26,884 --> 00:19:28,884
Yeah, that's right.

361
00:19:28,884 --> 00:19:30,984
It was over there before.

362
00:19:30,984 --> 00:19:33,884
If it's from that position you can see it, right?

363
00:19:33,884 --> 00:19:37,184
When Ayumi saw Mr. Shimazaki,

364
00:19:37,184 --> 00:19:40,684
a normal clock was still hung there.

365
00:19:40,684 --> 00:19:42,484
Then, Mr. Noda came along later

366
00:19:42,484 --> 00:19:46,184
and hung a mirror display clock there.

367
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:48,584
And, in order to check the position,

368
00:19:48,584 --> 00:19:51,884
Mr. Ebihara sat in the chair.

369
00:19:51,884 --> 00:19:53,484
Then, the culprit pinned him down from behind

370
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,584
and poked the dart into his chest.

371
00:19:55,584 --> 00:19:57,584
Then, the culprit placed a steamed towel on his face

372
00:19:57,584 --> 00:19:59,784
and placed an apron on top of him.

373
00:19:59,784 --> 00:20:02,984
He did so, that if in case someone were to look into the shop,

374
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:06,784
it would just look like someone were waiting for a shave.

375
00:20:06,784 --> 00:20:08,684
But, you just so happened to come

376
00:20:08,684 --> 00:20:11,184
before the culprit could flee.

377
00:20:11,184 --> 00:20:14,184
But, where is the original clock, then?

378
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:16,484
I found it in the shoe cabinet by the back door.

379
00:20:16,484 --> 00:20:18,484
That's all baloney.

380
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:20,384
Do you have proof that the first person

381
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:23,784
you met was me in disguise, Mr. Mouri?

382
00:20:23,784 --> 00:20:27,584
Mr. Noda, isn't what you're wearing under that shirt,

383
00:20:27,584 --> 00:20:30,184
the sweatshirt of the darts lovers club?

384
00:20:30,184 --> 00:20:32,684
Will you please take it off and show us all of it?

385
00:20:34,084 --> 00:20:35,584
Please, will you?

386
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:37,784
All right.

387
00:20:48,084 --> 00:20:50,684
Nothing's written on it.

388
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:52,784
Too bad.

389
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:59,084
I won't fall for a childish trick like that.

390
00:20:59,084 --> 00:21:02,984
Officer Takagi, take off Mr. Noda's shirt.

391
00:21:02,984 --> 00:21:04,184
Quickly.

392
00:21:04,184 --> 00:21:05,384
Yes, sir.

393
00:21:05,384 --> 00:21:07,484
What do you think you're doing? Stop it.

394
00:21:07,484 --> 00:21:08,484
Let me go.

395
00:21:18,284 --> 00:21:21,484
He was wearing it back to front.

396
00:21:21,484 --> 00:21:23,484
He quickly changed it

397
00:21:23,484 --> 00:21:25,584
while switching himself with the body.

398
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:30,284
No one other than the culprit has any reason to wear it backwards.

399
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:32,384
Noda, why did you...

400
00:21:35,484 --> 00:21:37,784
The IOU that I wrote out to Ebihara

401
00:21:37,784 --> 00:21:40,284
when I borrowed money from him

402
00:21:40,284 --> 00:21:43,184
was handed over to a loan shark.

403
00:21:43,184 --> 00:21:44,884
-What? -What?

404
00:21:44,884 --> 00:21:47,584
Money collectors came every day demanding to get their money back,

405
00:21:47,584 --> 00:21:49,784
that my wife had a neurotic breakdown.

406
00:21:49,784 --> 00:21:52,584
Why'd Mr. Ebihara do something like that?

407
00:21:52,584 --> 00:21:55,784
He was the one who originally was in debt.

408
00:21:55,784 --> 00:21:58,984
But he sold me to them in order to get rid of his own debt.

409
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,384
No way.

410
00:22:00,384 --> 00:22:02,884
I couldn't forgive him.

411
00:22:02,884 --> 00:22:04,784
I just couldn't forgive him.

412
00:23:32,784 --> 00:23:37,984
Darn, I thought we were feasting today.

413
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:42,084
You mean, he fell asleep right after solving the case?

414
00:23:42,084 --> 00:23:44,384
Yes, fast asleep.

415
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:47,184
That's why he missed going to the party.

416
00:23:52,584 --> 00:23:54,784
Ran! Give me another serving.

417
00:23:54,784 --> 00:23:59,984
Too bad you missed out on the feast, pops.

418
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,640
Next Conan's Hint:

419
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,760
"Animal Figurine"
