1
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:06,631
Just as you told us to we closed off the toll gate

2
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:08,931
but, are you sure that there was a dead person

3
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:10,831
inside the moving car?

4
00:00:10,831 --> 00:00:13,731
Yeah. And on top of it, the guy seems to have been strangled to death.

5
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:17,997
Then, isn't the person that was in the car with him the culprit?

6
00:00:18,231 --> 00:00:20,931
No, but the strange thing is

7
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:23,531
only the driver was in the car.

8
00:00:23,531 --> 00:00:25,131
That can't be...

9
00:00:25,131 --> 00:00:28,531
How can you strangle somebody who is driving a moving car?

10
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:30,009
I wonder...

11
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:32,531
But, Heiji was saying that.

12
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:35,131
The corpse's body was still warm,

13
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:37,631
so the culprit is somewhere nearby.

14
00:00:37,631 --> 00:00:40,019
Shinichi also said that so long as the toll gate that is a kilometer away

15
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:41,331
from the murder site is closed off,

16
00:00:41,331 --> 00:00:44,931
we can unmistakably arrest the culprit.

17
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:46,931
Heiji and Shinichi said so?

18
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:50,631
And? Where are those two?

19
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:52,331
They said they were going to narrow down the suspects

20
00:00:52,331 --> 00:00:54,731
and disappeared into the line of cars.

21
00:00:54,731 --> 00:00:56,531
How?

22
00:00:56,531 --> 00:00:59,731
When there are close to 100 cars?

23
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:02,931
Let's see what they can do.

24
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:04,631
The much rumored about high school detectives...

25
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,631
Three cars.

26
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:10,831
There are only three suspicious cars here.

27
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:13,831
A crisis is gracefully revived.

28
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:16,055
The table is turned and the mystery solved.

29
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:17,731
Deduction made by two. The case and love.

30
00:01:17,731 --> 00:01:20,059
What is the real question Ran wants to ask Shinichi?

31
00:01:20,231 --> 00:01:22,061
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:23,731
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:26,065
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

34
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:08,167
"The Real Question"

35
00:03:08,369 --> 00:03:09,769
Three cars.

36
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:13,369
There are only three suspicious cars here.

37
00:03:13,369 --> 00:03:14,969
All the other cars are in the way,

38
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:17,269
so you can let them go on their way.

39
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:19,169
Three cars?

40
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:22,869
The condition of the corpse tells us so.

41
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,669
It's an obvious fact that the victim's been strangled

42
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:27,169
while the car was on the move.

43
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:31,369
If so, the culprit's car must've approached the victim's car

44
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:33,669
and done something.

45
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:35,769
That's most natural, isn't it?

46
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:38,769
No matter what kind of method the culprit used,

47
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:40,769
what's for sure is that the culprit had to prepare beforehand,

48
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:45,669
and get on this freeway at roughly the same time as the victim.

49
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:47,069
I see.

50
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:48,769
So there were only three cars

51
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:51,869
that entered the interchange at the same time the victim's car did.

52
00:03:51,869 --> 00:03:54,213
But, is that true?

53
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:56,215
I'm sure you were shown the ticket

54
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:58,217
that was given to them at interchange,

55
00:03:58,217 --> 00:04:00,219
but nowadays there is a system called ETC (electric toll collection)

56
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:01,769
where you don't have to get tickets

57
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:04,769
to go through the gate, isn't there.

58
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:09,269
The victim got on the freeway using the same interchange we did,

59
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:12,569
the ETC device was out of order since before noon

60
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:16,235
and only the general gate where tickets were issued was open.

61
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:17,669
I see!

62
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:19,969
So you narrowed the drivers down to only those

63
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:21,969
who had the ticket of this interchange.

64
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:25,969
Moreover, after looking at the ticket the victim had...

65
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:30,249
We found that he got on the freeway an hour before us.

66
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:31,469
One hour before you?

67
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:35,169
They were probably eating at the parking area along the way or something.

68
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:36,269
In other words,

69
00:04:36,269 --> 00:04:38,569
although they got on the freeway

70
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,969
at the same time from the same interchange,

71
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:43,069
for some reason, there were only three cars

72
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:45,169
driving around the car of the victim,

73
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:47,869
despite him taking an hour break

74
00:04:47,869 --> 00:04:50,769
in the parking area.

75
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:52,869
-Right. -By the way,

76
00:04:52,869 --> 00:04:55,269
the car with the corpse of the victim in it

77
00:04:55,269 --> 00:04:58,669
is parked a kilometer ahead with its hazard lights on,

78
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:01,469
so please call forensics and have them make a detailed investigation.

79
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:03,669
Okay, shall we go over to the cars of the suspects

80
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:05,369
and listen to what they have to say?

81
00:05:05,369 --> 00:05:07,469
Yes.

82
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:12,569
Officer Sato, about the dinner, let's make it some other time.

83
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:14,769
Officer Sato?

84
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:17,769
What... What's with...

85
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:20,299
What's with those boys?

86
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:25,869
Why's Shinichi wearing your cap, Heiji?

87
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:28,307
He asked me to lend it to him.

88
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:31,169
Did you like caps, Shinichi?

89
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:32,869
Yes.

90
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:35,269
It somehow doesn't look right.

91
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:37,969
Stop bugging me and shut up.

92
00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:40,069
I'm just changing my image, you get?

93
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:46,325
Well, the guys that are after Shinichi thinks he's dead

94
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:50,329
so I put in on him thinking it best to keep his face hidden,

95
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:54,333
but I wonder how long he can stay the way he is?

96
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,969
Shinichi said the drug may keep for half a day.

97
00:05:57,969 --> 00:05:59,769
But, I wonder if it's true.

98
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,369
These are the three drivers

99
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:14,969
of the three suspicious cars we mentioned a while ago.

100
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:16,355
"Riko Mizuhashi (25)" -I was just

101
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:19,269
taking a drive on the freeway with Gunpei.

102
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:21,969
After all, the victim Gunpei was my boyfriend.

103
00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:27,069
Taking a drive? You were driving your own car, weren't you?

104
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:31,169
Yes, because Gunpei and I love to drive around by car.

105
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:32,371
What's wrong with that?

106
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:33,969
Did you both plan beforehand

107
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:36,375
that you would stop by at the parking area?

108
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,769
No.

109
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:39,769
Gunpei said that he suddenly got sleepy,

110
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:42,169
so he wanted to sleep about an hour.

111
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:44,169
So, I had no choice and went to kill time at the restaurant

112
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:46,869
of the parking area and woke him up when the time came.

113
00:06:46,869 --> 00:06:48,387
I see.

114
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:52,391
Then, what were the other two of you doing in the parking area?

115
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:54,769
"Atsuo Chuda (34)" -I got a bit hungry

116
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:58,069
so came inside the parking area to eat.

117
00:06:58,069 --> 00:06:59,969
Then, what about you?

118
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:01,369
My stomach...

119
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:05,669
"Futoshi Shimodori(48)" -suddenly got queasy while I was driving, so...

120
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:08,407
so I went to use the restroom in the parking area.

121
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:10,969
I heard that someone seems to have died in his car,

122
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:13,569
but we've got nothing to do with him!

123
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:17,269
I... I think it's somebody I don't know, too.

124
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:21,369
Liar! You both know Gunpei very well!

125
00:07:21,369 --> 00:07:22,421
What?

126
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:24,869
You're the leader of the Black Stars,

127
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:27,569
Gunpei's rival team!

128
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:32,969
You're the father of Akira, one of Gunpei's team members

129
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:35,969
who died the other day of an accident!

130
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:37,269
Hold on.

131
00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:40,439
Is the victim Gunpei Furuki?

132
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:43,569
"Gunpei Furuki (32)" -The former leader of that street racing gang

133
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:45,469
that hangs out in western Tokyo, the Red Comets?

134
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:47,469
Yes.

135
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:50,869
Although he stopped dyeing his hair and shaved off his beard.

136
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:53,069
I heard that the leader of Red Comets quit

137
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:55,269
after feeling responsible

138
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:57,969
for the accident that occurred.

139
00:07:57,969 --> 00:08:00,459
So, he was just taking his car out

140
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:03,469
for a last spin.

141
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:07,069
And yet. He came up right behind Gunpei's car

142
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,369
and insistently flashed his passing lights!

143
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:11,169
I'm sure he was venting his anger out at Gunpei

144
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:13,569
because he never once won races on mountain roads!

145
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:14,869
Shut up!

146
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,475
That guy had the nerve to say

147
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:18,269
he was resigning after his winning streak.

148
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:20,069
I just kind of gave him a push from behind.

149
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:23,869
But, he refused to take the hint, so I passed him.

150
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:26,485
Well, I guess after all he was taking a drive

151
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:29,969
with the woman he spilt with, so...

152
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:32,491
He tooted his horn so many times.

153
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:35,469
That's because after he overtook Gunpei,

154
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:38,769
I was right behind Gunpei's car.

155
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:42,069
But, he suddenly slowed down and I almost collided into his car,

156
00:08:42,069 --> 00:08:44,503
so I tooted my horn.

157
00:08:45,369 --> 00:08:47,569
Then he came out to the passing lane

158
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,969
as if to go after the car that overtook him,

159
00:08:49,969 --> 00:08:51,969
so I sounded my horn at him again.

160
00:08:53,869 --> 00:08:55,569
On the day of my sons funeral,

161
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:59,869
Gunpei swore that he was going to quit street racing,

162
00:08:59,869 --> 00:09:01,769
so I got upset.

163
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:03,569
It was right after that...

164
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:07,469
that the car Gunpei was driving started moving strangely.

165
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:09,069
He didn't try to overtake any car

166
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:10,529
despite having gone into the passing lane,

167
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:12,531
and started driving slowly scraping the side of his car

168
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:14,533
against the guardrail.

169
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:16,969
Thanks to my swift and accurate judgment

170
00:09:16,969 --> 00:09:19,069
of seeing that something was wrong,

171
00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:21,069
you went in front of his car

172
00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:23,869
and slowed down in order to stop his car,

173
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:27,269
and found the strangled victim.

174
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:30,269
You did that because Shinichi told you to.

175
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:35,069
So, you guys were the one who first found the body?

176
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:36,069
No,

177
00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:38,169
she did.

178
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:41,569
I thought that something was strange about Gunpeis car, too.

179
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:43,369
That's why I parked my car behind him

180
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:45,169
and ran up to him right away.

181
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:46,569
Gunpei!

182
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:49,969
But, if what the three are saying are true,

183
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:53,469
they wouldn't have had a chance to strangle him.

184
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:54,573
Then,

185
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:56,969
will you take us to where the car of the victim is now,

186
00:09:56,969 --> 00:09:58,269
Mr. Detectives?

187
00:09:58,269 --> 00:09:59,869
Sure, of course.

188
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:01,969
I'll go too, then.

189
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:05,669
Officer Takagi, please end the road block of the toll gate,

190
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:07,769
and wait here together with these three people.

191
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:09,069
Oh, yes, ma'am.

192
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:12,591
Kazuha, you wait here with that lady too.

193
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:15,669
We'll be right back.

194
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:20,169
He's leaving.

195
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:22,601
Shinichi's going to leave me again.

196
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:32,269
See you.

197
00:10:57,969 --> 00:11:00,369
You're not the only one.

198
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:04,643
I've got stuff that I want to ask you and say, too.

199
00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:08,269
So wait, okay?

200
00:11:10,969 --> 00:11:13,369
Shinichi.

201
00:11:15,469 --> 00:11:17,469
According to my deduction,

202
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,469
the stuff you want to ask me

203
00:11:19,469 --> 00:11:23,269
is probably the same thing I want to ask you about too.

204
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:38,969
Hey, what with all that lovey-dovey stuff!

205
00:11:38,969 --> 00:11:41,369
Oh, come off it, it's nothing like that.

206
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:42,681
Let's hurry and go.

207
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,683
I know.

208
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:46,369
Listen, Ran.

209
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:48,169
When Shinichi comes back,

210
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:50,689
don't you ever let him go!

211
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:56,269
You've got to be joking.

212
00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:59,069
Was the car really moving under this condition?

213
00:11:59,069 --> 00:12:01,169
Yes. Strange, isn't it?

214
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:02,701
What bothers me

215
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:04,069
are these thin lines here

216
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:06,705
on the rim of the edge of the window.

217
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:10,169
It seems that something was pulled from outside.

218
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:13,969
Hey, hey, don't tell me that a string or something

219
00:12:13,969 --> 00:12:16,715
was wrapped around his neck, and pulled on,

220
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:20,069
while the car was moving.

221
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:21,969
Something like that is impossible, not possible!

222
00:12:21,969 --> 00:12:25,769
Yes, if you pull on it with the strong force of a car,

223
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:29,869
before he suffocates to death, his neck bone would break.

224
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:32,369
That's what's bothering us.

225
00:12:32,369 --> 00:12:36,735
But, I wonder why the window was fully open?

226
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,469
Because he was a heavy smoker, maybe?

227
00:12:38,469 --> 00:12:42,369
See. The ashtray is full of cigarette butts.

228
00:12:42,369 --> 00:12:46,069
Maybe he had the window open to let the smoke out?

229
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:49,469
But since he was driving on the freeway,

230
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,069
I would think he'd only open the window just a little,

231
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:52,769
so the top part would be open.

232
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:54,753
How much is just a little bit?

233
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:58,769
So, like I was saying... Just enough to let the smoke out.

234
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:07,269
Holes?

235
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:11,469
There are two holes on the very bottom of the window.

236
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:14,569
I see.

237
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:16,775
So, that's the story.

238
00:13:16,969 --> 00:13:18,777
I know what trick was used

239
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:21,569
and figured out the culprit too, Shinichi.

240
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:25,369
Hey, how come you're sweating like that?

241
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:31,969
What? The effect of the drug may already have worn off?

242
00:13:31,969 --> 00:13:32,791
Yes.

243
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:35,069
I can't come up with the exact figures,

244
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:38,797
but judging from the last time the drug was given to Shinichi

245
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:42,569
it's about time he get another attack.

246
00:13:44,469 --> 00:13:46,269
Hey, Shinichi.

247
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:49,669
Don't tell me that...

248
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:53,969
No kidding. An attack already.

249
00:13:53,969 --> 00:13:57,169
I may be building up resistance to the drug...

250
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:00,819
-but it's only been 24 hours yet. -Shinichi! What's wrong?

251
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:04,823
Well, guess Shinichi'll somehow find a way to cope with it.

252
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:05,969
He did say that he could hold up about 30 minutes

253
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:08,827
after the attack hits him.

254
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:11,469
Oh, come on, you should know better.

255
00:14:11,469 --> 00:14:14,069
The effect of the drug shortening means that

256
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:15,869
the time it takes for his body to become that of child

257
00:14:15,869 --> 00:14:18,569
after the onset of the attack is also shortened.

258
00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:20,839
I'm not sure if he can hold out for 10 minutes or not.

259
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:22,841
Ten minutes?

260
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:25,369
If he doesn't know about this,

261
00:14:25,369 --> 00:14:27,169
that's it for him.

262
00:14:35,651 --> 00:14:37,651
Hey, Shinichi, are you okay?

263
00:14:37,651 --> 00:14:39,651
It seems you had a cold but...

264
00:14:39,651 --> 00:14:42,861
I think you should have a doctor check you after all.

265
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:45,851
I'll do that after I solve the mystery.

266
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:48,551
Please bring the three people here.

267
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:51,151
You've figured out who the culprit is?

268
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:54,873
Yes, ma'am. I'll go over there with the three right away.

269
00:14:56,151 --> 00:14:59,251
I'll take you by car, so please come this way.

270
00:14:59,251 --> 00:15:01,951
Come on, let's go too, Ran!

271
00:15:01,951 --> 00:15:04,883
I'll wait here.

272
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:07,751
Shinichi said that he'll be right back too.

273
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:08,887
I mean,

274
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:11,251
he always disappeared on you saying so, right?

275
00:15:11,251 --> 00:15:14,651
But, I don't want to get in the way of his deduction, either...

276
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:19,451
-Run! -Hey, wait!

277
00:15:24,051 --> 00:15:26,905
What? He was strangled to death?

278
00:15:27,151 --> 00:15:29,751
You mean while he was driving on the road?

279
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:30,909
Yes.

280
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:34,051
Then, wouldn't it have been impossible for us to do it?

281
00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:36,915
On the contrary,

282
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:40,919
if Gunpei is lured into taking a certain action, it's possible...

283
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:42,551
Hey, Shinichi!

284
00:15:42,551 --> 00:15:43,951
Don't talk anymore.

285
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:47,651
A certain action... Just what is that supposed to be...

286
00:15:47,651 --> 00:15:48,927
Ridiculous...

287
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:52,151
Just what can you do when you're speeding through the freeway...

288
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,951
Yes, you can!

289
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:56,651
If you use these two little holes made

290
00:15:56,651 --> 00:15:58,551
at the very bottom of the side mirror

291
00:15:58,551 --> 00:16:01,451
of the driver's seat.

292
00:16:01,451 --> 00:16:03,551
Holes?

293
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:05,251
The trick's simple.

294
00:16:05,251 --> 00:16:07,851
First you put both ends of a thin and strong fishing line

295
00:16:07,851 --> 00:16:11,551
through these two holes and pull them inside the car.

296
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:13,951
Then you pass both ends

297
00:16:13,951 --> 00:16:16,051
through the space in back of the headrest.

298
00:16:16,051 --> 00:16:20,151
Then you slip one end of the line in the back of Gunpei's necktie,

299
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:23,451
which after you tie this end of the line onto the other end of the line.

300
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:26,451
Then, all that's left to do, is to make him open the window.

301
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:31,251
The line will be pulled and automatically choke his neck.

302
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:33,451
There's an automatic button on the driver's seat side

303
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,975
that will keep the window lowering until it's fully opened.

304
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:41,651
But boy, just how did the culprit make him open the window then?

305
00:16:41,651 --> 00:16:46,251
All I did was tailgate from behind and overtake him.

306
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:50,751
All I did was toot my horn after that.

307
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:54,751
The first time was because Gunpei's car suddenly reduced speed

308
00:16:54,751 --> 00:16:58,997
and the second time was because he tried to go after Mr. Chuda's car.

309
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:00,999
I've got nothing to do with

310
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:02,651
because I did nothing.

311
00:17:02,651 --> 00:17:06,251
No. You slowed down, didn't you?

312
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:11,009
When you who were driving in front of Gunpei reduced speed,

313
00:17:11,251 --> 00:17:13,651
he slowed down too.

314
00:17:13,651 --> 00:17:16,151
Then, thinking that something was wrong,

315
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:17,951
he went out into the passing lane

316
00:17:17,951 --> 00:17:20,351
and came alongside your car.

317
00:17:20,351 --> 00:17:21,851
Wait a sec!

318
00:17:21,851 --> 00:17:23,951
Are you saying I shouted for Gunpei

319
00:17:23,951 --> 00:17:26,251
to open his window at that time or what?

320
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:28,051
Did you hear me shouting like that or what?

321
00:17:28,051 --> 00:17:29,027
No.

322
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:31,029
You didn't have to make a sound.

323
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:34,551
All you had to do was make a panicky face

324
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:36,451
and pretend to be shouting

325
00:17:36,451 --> 00:17:39,037
after aligning yourself with Gunpei's car.

326
00:17:40,451 --> 00:17:41,751
I see.

327
00:17:41,751 --> 00:17:44,551
He opened the window trying to figure out what you were shouting about.

328
00:17:44,551 --> 00:17:46,351
The only person who could've carried out this trick

329
00:17:46,351 --> 00:17:50,751
is you, Gunpei's girlfriend, lady.

330
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:55,351
You set the trick up when Gunpei was taking a nap in the parking area.

331
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:56,751
You probably had the key of his car

332
00:17:56,751 --> 00:17:59,051
because you were going to wake him up.

333
00:18:00,051 --> 00:18:01,851
I see.

334
00:18:01,851 --> 00:18:04,251
You probably put Gunpei to sleep

335
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,651
with a sleeping pill or something beforehand.

336
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:08,251
You probably opened the holes in the window

337
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:10,751
before going on the drive too.

338
00:18:10,751 --> 00:18:13,071
If Gunpei had the top part of his window open all the time

339
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:16,351
to let the smoke from his cigarette outside,

340
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:19,077
the holes would be hidden and out of view.

341
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:20,551
What proof do you have?

342
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:23,081
Do you have any proof that proves I did it?

343
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:25,751
After the corpse was found, the only time you were able to be alone

344
00:18:25,751 --> 00:18:29,651
was in your car when you were heading for the toll gate.

345
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:33,851
So, if we check your car, we should be able to find

346
00:18:33,851 --> 00:18:37,095
the fishing line that you cut and removed

347
00:18:37,251 --> 00:18:40,351
when you ran over to his car before we did.

348
00:18:42,151 --> 00:18:45,103
It could be that the chloroform you used

349
00:18:45,351 --> 00:18:49,107
to make Gunpei sleep sounder

350
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:51,751
and the bottle of ammonia that you used to wake him up

351
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:55,113
may still be in your car and be found.

352
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:02,451
The fishing line,

353
00:19:02,451 --> 00:19:06,151
the chloroform, as well as the ammonia

354
00:19:06,151 --> 00:19:08,551
are all in my car.

355
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:17,151
Well, I expected to at least be questioned by the police

356
00:19:17,151 --> 00:19:22,151
but I had no idea that these two cute detectives

357
00:19:22,151 --> 00:19:24,851
would suddenly see through my trick.

358
00:19:24,851 --> 00:19:27,751
It's just as these detectives say,

359
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:31,149
I sent Gunpei to his grave

360
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:33,551
while he was at the wheels.

361
00:19:33,551 --> 00:19:36,951
Yes, in the same way...

362
00:19:37,951 --> 00:19:39,651
Akira died at the wheels.

363
00:19:39,651 --> 00:19:41,851
What? Akira?

364
00:19:41,851 --> 00:19:44,151
You mean my son, Akira?

365
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:45,551
Yeah.

366
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:49,151
I switched from Gunpei to Akira,

367
00:19:49,151 --> 00:19:51,851
right after Gunpei lost the battle against Akira

368
00:19:51,851 --> 00:19:53,551
when driving through the mountain path.

369
00:19:53,551 --> 00:19:57,175
Because I like the fastest driver.

370
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:58,751
I see.

371
00:19:58,751 --> 00:20:02,351
That's why Gunpei set up that race battle

372
00:20:02,351 --> 00:20:04,451
on that rainy day?

373
00:20:04,451 --> 00:20:05,951
It wasn't raining!

374
00:20:05,951 --> 00:20:07,185
It was a storm!

375
00:20:07,351 --> 00:20:10,851
That was no day that a battle could be held!

376
00:20:10,851 --> 00:20:14,051
But Gunpei went and provoked Akira.

377
00:20:15,451 --> 00:20:17,751
Just as expected, Akira's car

378
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:20,951
slipped on the wet rainy road and fell to the bottom of cliff.

379
00:20:20,951 --> 00:20:23,201
But, weren't they both responsible for what happened then?

380
00:20:24,451 --> 00:20:25,951
The one who was provoked most likely

381
00:20:25,951 --> 00:20:28,651
knew of the risk he was taking too, right?

382
00:20:28,651 --> 00:20:30,051
And the one that provoked the victim

383
00:20:30,051 --> 00:20:33,851
felt sorry for what he did and was planning to go straight, right?

384
00:20:33,851 --> 00:20:35,651
That guy go straight?

385
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,215
You've got to be kidding!

386
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:39,217
He's just feigning to go straight!

387
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:41,219
I agree too.

388
00:20:41,451 --> 00:20:43,551
Once you become a street racer,

389
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:45,223
you can't quit until you die.

390
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:47,951
That's why I stopped him!

391
00:20:47,951 --> 00:20:51,229
The cold-blooded red devil of the mountain road!

392
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:56,851
No. I think he was full of regret.

393
00:20:56,851 --> 00:21:00,151
How the hell do you know?

394
00:21:00,151 --> 00:21:02,851
On top of the meter panel of the driver's seat side

395
00:21:02,851 --> 00:21:05,851
were a lighter and cigarette, right?

396
00:21:05,851 --> 00:21:09,247
From the fact that the cigarette filter in the ashtray being damp,

397
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:14,251
it's definite that he was smoking until the time he was strangled.

398
00:21:14,251 --> 00:21:18,051
He would've noticed as soon as he leaned over to take a cigarette,

399
00:21:18,051 --> 00:21:21,051
that something was attached behind his neck.

400
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:25,051
Then, why didn't he... why didn't he cut the line?

401
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:28,051
Probably because he had made up his mind

402
00:21:28,051 --> 00:21:33,271
to atone for what he had done by taking his own life.

403
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:36,251
No way.

404
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:40,051
Don't tell me that he did what he did, knowing what would happen?

405
00:21:40,051 --> 00:21:44,251
Even so, I don't feel the least bit sorry for him

406
00:21:44,251 --> 00:21:47,285
or for you who killed him.

407
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:49,651
The choice he made of turning you into a criminal

408
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:52,751
is more than unforgivable.

409
00:21:52,751 --> 00:21:57,051
No matter what the reason may have been,

410
00:21:57,051 --> 00:21:59,751
it's a choice he should've never...

411
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:02,251
sought to be the answer...

412
00:22:02,251 --> 00:22:03,951
Shinichi!

413
00:22:03,951 --> 00:22:05,951
Officer Takagi, call an ambulance!

414
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:07,305
Yes, ma'am!

415
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:11,309
-No. -Not the hospital!

416
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:13,311
Let's go to the hospital.

417
00:22:13,311 --> 00:22:14,951
Ran?

418
00:22:14,951 --> 00:22:18,951
Let's go to the hospital and after you're well,

419
00:22:18,951 --> 00:22:21,051
you're going to have to tell me

420
00:22:21,051 --> 00:22:23,321
the answer to the deduction you made, Shinichi!

421
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:24,951
Ran.

422
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,411
Next Conan's Hint:

423
00:23:53,411 --> 00:23:55,400
"Fleece jacket"

424
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,236
In the next episode, it seems like somebody's in a bad mood.

425
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:00,068
-Who? -Can't you tell just by looking.

426
00:24:00,068 --> 00:24:00,940
See.
