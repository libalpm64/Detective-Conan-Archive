1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,040
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,240
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,040
The case of the treasure thief is solved!

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,240
What is Ayumi's real motive?

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,840
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,160
We the members of the Youth Detective Squad

9
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,960
were taken by Ayumi

10
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,960
to go get a set of Girls' Festival dolls at the Kanno residence.

11
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,960
While we were there...

12
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,060
Mr. Mizutaka Tsumagari brings an antique appraiser, Mr. Yoshiharu Mie,

13
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,360
with him saying that he wants to buy

14
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,660
the hanging scroll at a very high price, but...

15
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,960
Mrs. Kanno's grandma flatly refuses.

16
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,460
But, while we were out for shopping,

17
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,760
that hanging scroll disappears!

18
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,260
Look, the time the fax was sent out all show 15:28!

19
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,460
Which means that the fax kept coming in

20
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,260
all the while we were out shopping until we came back, right?

21
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,760
Do you think a burglar would break into a room

22
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,860
where noise is constantly coming from?

23
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,060
Besides, it's strange that

24
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,360
the burglar didn't notice her wallet

25
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,560
and if the burglar couldn't find what he was after,

26
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,260
wouldn't all the other rooms be ransacked too?

27
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,060
True.

28
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,660
The strangest thing is,

29
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,260
why only the hanging scroll was stolen.

30
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,260
But, that hanging scroll is worth 20,000,000 yen.

31
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,260
You idiot, only a professional would know

32
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,060
if that scroll is really worth that price.

33
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,060
Which means that

34
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,460
the burglar knew that the scroll was here to begin with.

35
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,160
Yeah.

36
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,660
But if the burglar was after the scroll,

37
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,060
the other room wouldn't have been ransacked.

38
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,860
Maybe the burglar messed up the other room

39
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,860
just to throw people off, so that he's not suspected.

40
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,560
Which means the culprit has no definite alibi, and on top of that

41
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,860
had to face the police reluctantly after the incident.

42
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,960
Furthermore, that person knows the value of that hanging scroll!

43
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:49,860
"Girls' Festival Dolls in the Sunset (Part 2)"

44
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,160
Hey, Conan.

45
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,760
But in the Japanese room...

46
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,960
All there is the set of Girls' Festival dolls,

47
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,260
and nothing else...

48
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,360
Look, see!

49
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,060
It's changed, isn't it?

50
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,260
It's somehow different from how it was before we went shopping.

51
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,360
Somehow different?

52
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,360
It looks the same to me.

53
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,160
Oh, I see!

54
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,460
The position of the Emperor and the Empress isn't correct.

55
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,560
The right and left is opposite!

56
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,960
Right.

57
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,960
It's not only those two.

58
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,060
Ayumi, will you get your digital camera out?

59
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,660
Okay!

60
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,160
-Here you go! -Thank you!

61
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,260
See. Although it's very slight,

62
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,660
when you compare the picture with the one that was taken previously,

63
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,960
the position of the other 13 dolls are slightly moved, right?

64
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,160
You're right.

65
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,860
It's most likely that the person who took the hanging scroll

66
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,160
bumped into the altar of the dolls accidentally

67
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,360
and the dolls fell.

68
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,660
I see.

69
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,760
So the person who lined the dolls back again,

70
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,860
placed them in the wrong position.

71
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,660
And? Who's the culprit?

72
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,160
-Huh? -Hurry up and tell us!

73
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,660
Oh, well, as to that...

74
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,260
I still haven't figured it out.

75
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,260
Is that so?

76
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,560
Stop talking like you got the answer then!

77
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,060
The dolls look sad.

78
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,460
See. This doll here was smiling a bit more

79
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,260
when it was first lined up.

80
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,960
How dare they drop the dolls

81
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,260
after we went through the trouble of lining them up right.

82
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,460
I see! I got it!

83
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,760
Huh?

84
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,360
The burglar is somebody who doesn't know very well

85
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,660
how the dolls should be lined up.

86
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,160
The burglar is you!

87
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,560
Mr. Tsumagari!

88
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,260
I remember you said you don't have a daughter

89
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,960
so you're not interested in the dolls, right?

90
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,960
I see, so that's why you lined the dolls up wrong!

91
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,960
Please confess!

92
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,060
You're the burglar, aren't you?

93
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,560
No.

94
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,060
It's not Mr. Tsumagari!

95
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,760
The burglar is one of the two!

96
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,660
Only these two would be able to do something like this!

97
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,260
But why?

98
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,560
Why did the person line the dolls that dropped back again?

99
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,960
It would've been more effective to leave the dolls as they were,

100
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,460
to make it look like burglary.

101
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,360
Mr. Tsumagari,

102
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,360
will you please let me check your room out?

103
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
Huh?

104
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,760
Of course, I'm asking you to do it voluntarily.

105
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,860
Oh, all right!

106
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,760
Go on and check my room out if you want to!

107
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,260
I assure you that you'll find nothing!

108
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:30,460
Oh, and I'm going to have to do a body check on all three of you,

109
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,660
since there is a possibility that

110
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,460
you may be hiding the hanging scroll somewhere in your body.

111
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,260
Okay, we'll get a woman officer and start right away.

112
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,260
We better move fast or the sun will set.

113
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,460
-Yes, sir. -What? Oh, no...

114
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,760
It's this late already.

115
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,460
Are you sure that Mr. Tsumagari is the culprit?

116
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,960
Although you did seem really confident...

117
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,760
You're the one that started this whole thing!

118
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,360
Hey, Conan.

119
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,960
Did you figure out who the culprit is?

120
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
Huh?

121
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,260
Oh, I'm sorry,

122
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,660
I'm in the process of thinking now.

123
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:14,160
We'd better hurry or the steps will...

124
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,660
The steps...

125
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,260
-Huh? -Thanks, Ayumi!

126
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,060
I've figured it out!

127
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,960
Really? Have you figured out who the culprit is, then?

128
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,360
Yeah, thanks to you, Ayumi!

129
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,560
I'll go get the officers then!

130
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,760
Ayumi?

131
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,760
What, you've figured out who stole the hanging scroll?

132
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,960
Who could've done a thing like that?

133
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,960
You'll find out after you come to Mrs. Kanno's room!

134
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,560
Hurry, officer!

135
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,760
Okay.

136
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,360
Please...

137
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,960
Please, sunset.

138
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,660
Stay still a little while longer.

139
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,360
Just a little while longer.

140
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,560
I see.

141
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,260
So this sunset was what you were waiting for.

142
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,160
Haibara.

143
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,260
Looks beautiful, doesn't it?

144
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,260
You seem to have an eye for these things.

145
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,660
Really?

146
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,360
So let's hurry and solve the case, bring him along!

147
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,460
Okay!

148
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,760
The sunset.

149
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,460
It smears the world in blood.

150
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,560
The death throes of the sun.

151
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,160
I wonder how many more times I'll get to see.

152
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,060
This sad color.

153
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,160
And, who is it that solved the case?

154
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,260
Don't tell me you did, Mrs. Kanno?

155
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,860
-Oh, no. -Me!

156
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,960
You, sonny?

157
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,360
Yep! I've figured it all out!

158
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,260
The one who took the hanging scroll and where it is too!

159
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,660
The hint is the altar of the dolls!

160
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,660
When the thief took the hanging scroll and fled,

161
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,060
the thief accidentally bumped into the doll altar and the dolls fell.

162
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,660
Then when putting the dolls back on the steps,

163
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,660
the position of the Emperor and Empress were reversed, right?

164
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,260
That's why we searched Mr. Tsumagari's room.

165
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,260
Of all the four people

166
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,560
that have a motive for stealing the hanging scroll,

167
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,860
only he doesn't know how to line the dolls up!

168
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,860
-No, it's just the opposite! -Opposite?

169
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,660
Take a good look at the altar!

170
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,660
When you compare it to the time when we lined the dolls up,

171
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,460
before the burglar broke in,

172
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,160
all of the dolls are a bit out of position,

173
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,460
and except for the Emperor and Empress,

174
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,860
all the dolls are in the correct position!

175
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,460
Is he right?

176
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,960
Yes, he's correct.

177
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,660
I checked the position of the dolls

178
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,460
after the children lined them in place.

179
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,260
If the burglar bumped into the altar with enough impact

180
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,760
to drop the Emperor and the Empress,

181
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,460
the other dolls and accessories would have fell too, right?

182
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,160
If the person didn't know how to line the dolls up,

183
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,060
there is no way that the dolls would be lined up as perfectly as this!

184
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:26,860
But, the burglar did actually line the Emperor and Empress up wrong.

185
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,960
What if it's not a mistake?

186
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,560
What if this is the traditional way that

187
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,560
dolls used to be lined up in ancient times in Japan?

188
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,460
The traditional way?

189
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,960
Yep!

190
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,160
Originally in Japan, the honourable seat was to the left

191
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,560
and the lower seat to the right,

192
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,360
so the person who is higher in rank used to stand on the left.

193
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,560
As you can see, the elderly Minister of the Left is on the left,

194
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,160
whereas, the young Minister of the Right is on the right.

195
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,560
So, the Emperor and Empress in accordance

196
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,960
to this tradition of men being higher in rank than women,

197
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,860
the Emperor is on the left and the Empress is on the right.

198
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,460
Hey, Conan, you're wrong!

199
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,460
The man's on the right!

200
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,160
Like I've been telling you, from the view point of the dolls,

201
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,160
the Emperor is to the left of the Empress!

202
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,860
Oh, I see.

203
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,260
But, all the dolls decorated in show windows

204
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,760
are opposite from the altar there.

205
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,860
That's because this is Tokyo!

206
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,860
During the Meiji Restoration, when the western custom

207
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,860
of the "right side being the honourable position" entered Japan,

208
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:31,360
the position of the Emperor during the coronation also changed,

209
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,460
and so followed the doll industry of Tokyo!

210
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,060
You sure know a lot, don't you, sonny?

211
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:44,460
Yep, I love to check out things like this!

212
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,260
Conan?

213
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,160
I've been wanting to ask you from some time ago but...

214
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,160
Why do you always talk childish only when you talk to adults?

215
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,160
It's as you're fawning on them or something.

216
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,860
Oh, yeah?

217
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,560
Rather, you give me the creeps.

218
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,060
Okay, I will act natural like always. Satisfied?

219
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,960
I like the way you talk, it's cute.

220
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,860
Although it's kind of girlish, it's sweet.

221
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,360
So, who's the burglar, sonny?

222
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,960
Oh, yes. So, the burglar is someone

223
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,460
who knows how the dolls used to lined up in olden times.

224
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,960
Either Grandma Kanno or Appraiser Mr. Mie!

225
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,330
When grandma was still a child,

226
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,730
the old way of lining up the dolls was widespread.

227
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,030
Besides, she's originally from Kyoto!

228
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,330
There are many homes in Kyoto that take traditional seriously

229
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,930
and stick to the traditional way of doing things.

230
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:57,930
She probably learned to line the dolls up the traditional way!

231
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:02,730
Mr. Mie should also know the traditional way of lining the dolls up,

232
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,830
and if he knows that those dolls are from Kyoto,

233
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:11,330
it's not inconceivable that he would line them up that way.

234
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,730
Does he know that those dolls are from Kyoto?

235
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,130
Because Setsuko told him so,

236
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,830
and the dolls from Kyoto have accessories

237
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,530
that are different from the dolls in Tokyo,

238
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,730
so a professional would be able to tell right off the bat.

239
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,730
So, which one of them is the burglar

240
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,530
and where is the hanging scroll?

241
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,930
Don't tell me you don't know who it is again?

242
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,630
I know who it is!

243
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,830
Because Ayumi gave me the hint, "steps".

244
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,830
Steps, don't tell me that...

245
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,430
I get it!

246
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:43,530
The burglar climbed the altar as if they were steps

247
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:47,630
and hid the hanging scroll in the cabinet above the closet!

248
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,330
And, when the burglar did so,

249
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,230
some of the dolls were kicked by the burglar's foot,

250
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,130
so the dolls fell!

251
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:56,230
Hey, Genta, be careful!

252
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:01,330
So, the hanging scroll is probably still in here.

253
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,230
It's not here.

254
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,330
Not there. In the back, behind!

255
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:09,030
A steps like this altar was brought out

256
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,330
and the hanging scroll was hid in the back.

257
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:15,830
So the dolls fell when the altar was moved.

258
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,430
The burglar wasn't aware that if you go inside the closet like this,

259
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,330
it would've been easy to hide the scroll.

260
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:27,730
The box for the doll set is here, but there's nothing else.

261
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:33,130
Maybe the dolls fell when the burglar fled, after all.

262
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,030
No... no dolls were dropped.

263
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:40,730
The burglar took all the dolls away from the altar deliberately

264
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,130
in order to hide the hanging scroll.

265
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,430
Took the dolls away?

266
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,130
Don't tell me that the hanging scroll is...

267
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,130
Hey, help me move the dolls!

268
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,330
Yes, sir!

269
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,530
Yes, it's a convenient place to hide paper things

270
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,630
such as hanging scrolls.

271
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:03,130
And yet, it's a place that's hard to find even if you search for it.

272
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,230
The place is...

273
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:11,530
behind the red cloth of the altar!

274
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,530
I see.

275
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:17,530
A place that is not visible unless all the dolls are moved,

276
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:21,130
is hard to reach, in other words, hard to find.

277
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:25,430
And, Ayumi mentioned that the dolls looked sad.

278
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,930
That's because the this wooden plate that

279
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,030
is on the top of the hanging scroll was underneath.

280
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,030
If you put the wooden place above this laughing doll,

281
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,530
it tilts forward

282
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,830
and its facial expression changes, doesn't it?

283
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:42,330
I see, that's why its laughing face looked a bit different!

284
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,630
But, why is it placed reversed?

285
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,630
Because the thick plate that is attached under the hanging scroll

286
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,730
cannot be covered with just the red cloth.

287
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,830
That's why it was placed upside down and hidden behind

288
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,530
the folding screen on the very top of the altar.

289
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,130
Wait!

290
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,330
If the burglar hid the hanging scroll in a place like this,

291
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,330
it means...

292
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:05,130
Yeah. After the police leave, the burglar

293
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,930
can pretend to put the dolls away

294
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,830
and also retrieve the hanging scroll.

295
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,830
Only grandma is capable of doing this, right?

296
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,930
-What? -Grandma?

297
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,430
-Oh, no! -No joke?

298
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,530
Yeah. After we left to go shopping and she was at home all alone,

299
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,030
she probably came up with the idea

300
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,930
of hiding the hanging scroll

301
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,530
and messing up the room to make it look like a burglar broke in!

302
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,330
And then she goes up shopping herself

303
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:38,530
to make it look as if a burglar broke in while she was out.

304
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,430
But, I wonder if that granny would even come across

305
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,830
the idea of a burglar opening the veranda window

306
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,730
and breaking in through the roof?

307
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,830
Well, they broadcast a lot of those kinds of programs on TV recently

308
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,530
that I'm sure grandma had seen them too.

309
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:56,230
I guess so.

310
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,730
But, why would she do a thing like that?

311
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,730
Don't tell me...

312
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,530
You tried to get insurance money for it

313
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,930
after making it look as if it were stolen...

314
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,430
I would never do something so evil.

315
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:13,930
This hanging scroll is the protective god of the Kanno family.

316
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,430
Protective god?

317
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,630
Yes. That's why I decided to hide it for now,

318
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,430
and after my son returns from work,

319
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:28,030
I was going to show him the Thunder God and tell him about it.

320
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:32,630
That is, not to repeat the mistake that I made.

321
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,930
Repeat? Don't tell me that...

322
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,630
Right.

323
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,830
We originally had the hanging scroll of the Wind God here too.

324
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:46,030
It was found in the storeroom of my husband's parental home,

325
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,430
so we're not sure where it came from but...

326
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,030
My husband used to always say,

327
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,330
"We are the Kanno family, so this hanging scroll"

328
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,530
"is most likely our protective god!"

329
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:59,130
Come to think of it, the Wind God and Thunder God

330
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,530
are the guardian deity of the 12 handed Goddess of Mercy.

331
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:06,430
When my son got married,

332
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,230
we were having trouble getting money together to buy this condo.

333
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:14,130
Therefore, I decided to sell the Wind God scroll.

334
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,230
I sold it secretly while my husband was on a company trip.

335
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,630
Then...

336
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:24,730
the passenger liner that my husband was on board sunk

337
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,530
when they encountered a typhoon

338
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:29,630
as if the Wind God had created.

339
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:35,530
Then are you saying that the cursed Wind God scroll

340
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,230
made its rounds and came to me.

341
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,430
It is not cursed.

342
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,930
Like they say the Girls' Festival dolls were originally placed

343
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,630
by the pillow of the child

344
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:48,530
as a protective charm to ward off evil.

345
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:55,130
Likewise, every time that hanging scroll is stained or soiled,

346
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,430
I feel that it may be warding off misfortune

347
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:02,630
that may befall our family for us.

348
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:11,330
So, please do not lay a hand on that Thunder God scroll.

349
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,930
Oh, well...

350
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:19,030
Now that we know it is not only very valuable,

351
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,730
but also has additional benefits,

352
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:24,930
the more we wouldn't mind risking our lives for it,

353
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,330
right, Mr. Tsumagari?

354
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,130
No, I'm totally satisfied with only the Wind God.

355
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,630
Forget all of this, okay?

356
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:37,430
My, how disappointing...

357
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:41,730
However, I will be back again later, Mrs. Kanno.

358
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,630
Huh?

359
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:46,530
To teach you an easy way to store it.

360
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,830
Let's get going too, officers.

361
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:59,130
I'll have to be punished for having committed this case.

362
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,130
A case?

363
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,130
Give me a break!

364
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,430
The owner of the house messes the room up,

365
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:08,130
and something disappears so there was a great fuss over it.

366
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,930
If I file this as a case,

367
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:13,930
I'm really going to be struck by my boss' thunder!

368
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,430
Oh, god. How frightening.

369
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:24,830
However, it is a fact that I scared the children.

370
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,230
I'll help you pack the dolls as a token of my apology.

371
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,030
So that you can take it home right away.

372
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,330
Oh, on second thought I'm not going to take it!

373
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:36,230
Maybe my Hina doll was broken

374
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:41,730
because it warded off evil in my place.

375
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:44,930
So, I'll try asking daddy again

376
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,630
if he'll get it repaired for me!

377
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,330
I'm so sorry, after you went out of your way to help me.

378
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,730
Oh no, no problem.

379
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,130
Are you sure?

380
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,830
Yep!

381
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,230
Besides,

382
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:59,830
the Girls' Festival doll that I really wanted...

383
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,330
What I really, really want is...

384
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,330
What I really, really want is...

385
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,830
I don't care what but...

386
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,330
You'd better hurry

387
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:45,730
or you're going to lose the chance to push the shutter.

388
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,630
Because it looks just great now.

389
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,730
Hey, take a look of that!

390
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,030
What a beautiful sunset.

391
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,530
I see!

392
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:00,530
You wanted to take a picture of this sunset, right, Ayumi?

393
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,230
Conan, you sit right here!

394
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:06,730
Mitsuhiko, Haibara and Genta sit one step below!

395
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,030
Here's the camera!

396
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,530
Yes, yes.

397
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,130
But, why are we facing this way?

398
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:15,030
You may as well take a picture with the sunset in the background

399
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,730
because it'll be a nice picture that way.

400
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,930
Oh, never mind.

401
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,430
Okay, everybody, smile!

402
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:25,730
The stairs are red from the sunset,

403
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:29,330
so with the cream-colored elevator door in the background,

404
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,630
you all look as if you're...

405
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,430
Hina dolls!

406
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,730
Huh?

407
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,530
Which means Conan is the Emperor

408
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:39,030
and I'm the Minister of the Right?

409
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,130
Rather, the three Court Ladies.

410
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,330
Hey, you gotta be joking!

411
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,030
No, I...

412
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:48,530
-Haibara, let's go up the steps! -Huh?

413
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,130
Move it, Conan!

414
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,630
No!

415
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:59,830
I mean, we're more like the five Musicians.

416
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,440
Next Conan's Hint:

417
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,960
"The White-Eye's nest"

418
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,840
Pops's will be making his appearance after a long time!

419
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,960
Are you sure the needle of your tranquilizing gun isn't rusted?
