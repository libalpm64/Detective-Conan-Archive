1
00:00:02,664 --> 00:00:04,364
The light of summer is the glory of yesterday.

2
00:00:04,364 --> 00:00:06,564
After the tears is a yellow sunflower.

3
00:00:06,564 --> 00:00:08,164
A sudden sad tragedy.

4
00:00:08,164 --> 00:00:09,564
No matter how well something is hidden,

5
00:00:09,564 --> 00:00:11,264
the sunflower witnesses it all.

6
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:12,664
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,664 --> 00:00:14,264
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,364
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:02:03,697 --> 00:02:04,797
Inspector!

10
00:02:04,797 --> 00:02:05,897
Mr. Mouri.

11
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:14,997
I heard that Ms. Hiroko Inoue was murdered.

12
00:02:14,997 --> 00:02:17,497
Is the victim an acquaintance of yours?

13
00:02:19,297 --> 00:02:20,697
Mr. Takaoka.

14
00:02:20,697 --> 00:02:23,297
I don't know what to say.

15
00:02:23,297 --> 00:02:26,197
I wanted her to lead a happy life from now on.

16
00:02:26,197 --> 00:02:29,797
"Akira Takaoka, age 35" -What a thing to happen at such a time.

17
00:02:29,797 --> 00:02:32,597
I understand how you feel.

18
00:02:32,597 --> 00:02:36,297
Who could've done something as ruthless as this?

19
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:44,997
And, Inspector.

20
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:46,897
What is the estimated time of death?

21
00:02:46,897 --> 00:02:48,697
According to the coroner,

22
00:02:48,697 --> 00:02:51,497
it seems to be between 11am to 1pm today.

23
00:03:07,797 --> 00:03:09,697
Sunflower...

24
00:03:09,697 --> 00:03:12,497
Hiroko used to like this flower.

25
00:03:12,497 --> 00:03:15,597
Hey, you saw the culprit, didn't you?

26
00:03:15,597 --> 00:03:17,197
Who was it?

27
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,097
The one that did this to her.

28
00:03:20,097 --> 00:03:22,197
Who the heck was it, anyway?

29
00:03:28,197 --> 00:03:33,997
"Yellow Alibi"

30
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:38,597
Hiroko used to run a bar called Sunflower.

31
00:03:38,597 --> 00:03:41,197
I used to go there too.

32
00:03:41,197 --> 00:03:42,697
Sunflower?

33
00:03:42,697 --> 00:03:46,197
Yes, she used to say that she liked sunflowers,

34
00:03:46,197 --> 00:03:47,697
because they stand tall facing the sun

35
00:03:47,697 --> 00:03:51,097
and watching them gave her courage.

36
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,697
That's why she said she named her shop after them.

37
00:03:53,697 --> 00:03:55,297
"Bar Sunflower"

38
00:03:55,297 --> 00:03:58,497
I visited the shop yesterday too.

39
00:03:58,497 --> 00:03:59,997
And at that time she said that...

40
00:03:59,997 --> 00:04:02,397
"Hiroko Inoue, age 38" -she finally found happiness.

41
00:04:02,397 --> 00:04:05,297
She really looked so happy.

42
00:04:05,297 --> 00:04:06,897
Cheers...

43
00:04:06,897 --> 00:04:08,797
Finally found happiness?

44
00:04:08,797 --> 00:04:09,997
Yes.

45
00:04:09,997 --> 00:04:12,897
She and Mr. Takaoka...

46
00:04:12,897 --> 00:04:14,597
they're going together.

47
00:04:14,597 --> 00:04:16,397
He worked on directing independent films

48
00:04:16,397 --> 00:04:18,697
for the past seven years.

49
00:04:18,697 --> 00:04:21,597
But just recently, a large movie company...

50
00:04:21,597 --> 00:04:25,297
asked him to direct a film for them.

51
00:04:25,297 --> 00:04:26,597
Oh...

52
00:04:26,597 --> 00:04:27,997
I think it's going to be a movie featuring the crying sand

53
00:04:27,997 --> 00:04:30,297
that's found on White Sand Beach

54
00:04:30,297 --> 00:04:33,397
in his homeland in Fukushima prefecture.

55
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:35,397
It seems like he went there by himself last night

56
00:04:35,397 --> 00:04:38,797
to do a preliminary inspection of the filming site.

57
00:04:38,797 --> 00:04:41,297
Believing in his talent

58
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:43,097
and knowing his day would come,

59
00:04:43,097 --> 00:04:46,497
Hiroko supported him all this time.

60
00:04:46,497 --> 00:04:48,897
"Bar Sunflower"

61
00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:50,797
Her long support during tough times

62
00:04:50,797 --> 00:04:53,597
was just about to be rewarded,

63
00:04:53,597 --> 00:04:56,497
so, I feel so vexed.

64
00:05:01,597 --> 00:05:03,497
Yes, this is Megure.

65
00:05:03,497 --> 00:05:06,397
The old lady at the cigarette shop diagonal to the condo

66
00:05:06,397 --> 00:05:08,797
seems to have been at the shop all day,

67
00:05:08,797 --> 00:05:10,597
but didn't witness anybody going in or out of the condo

68
00:05:10,597 --> 00:05:13,997
before or after the estimated time of death.

69
00:05:13,997 --> 00:05:15,497
Only after that...

70
00:05:15,497 --> 00:05:16,697
an employee from an electric appliance shop

71
00:05:16,697 --> 00:05:18,897
carry a large cardboard box and went into the condo,

72
00:05:18,897 --> 00:05:21,297
but this was just a while ago

73
00:05:21,297 --> 00:05:24,597
at about 4.30pm.

74
00:05:24,597 --> 00:05:27,797
It doesn't seem to have anything to do with this case.

75
00:05:27,797 --> 00:05:29,997
Please continue asking around.

76
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,197
The one who sitting next to Mr. Takaoka?

77
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:33,397
His name is Mr. Shu Kizuka.

78
00:05:33,397 --> 00:05:35,697
They are both co-workers at a part-time job.

79
00:05:35,697 --> 00:05:37,597
He found the victim

80
00:05:37,597 --> 00:05:39,297
and called police.

81
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,897
Huh? You mean he's the one who found Ms. Hiroko

82
00:05:42,897 --> 00:05:44,397
and not Mr. Takaoka?

83
00:05:44,397 --> 00:05:45,497
Yes.

84
00:05:45,497 --> 00:05:47,997
He wants to be a script writer.

85
00:05:47,997 --> 00:05:49,497
"Shu Kizuka, age 35" -Since Mr. Takaoka told him

86
00:05:49,497 --> 00:05:51,597
that he wanted to borrow ideas for his story,

87
00:05:51,597 --> 00:05:54,697
they arranged to meet in this room at 5pm.

88
00:05:54,697 --> 00:05:57,297
He says the door wasn't locked.

89
00:05:58,297 --> 00:05:59,497
Hello.

90
00:05:59,497 --> 00:06:00,797
I'm Kizuka.

91
00:06:00,797 --> 00:06:04,297
Hiroko, is Mr. Takaoka back?

92
00:06:07,097 --> 00:06:09,097
Hiroko...

93
00:06:09,097 --> 00:06:13,897
We got his call and arrived here at 5.20pm.

94
00:06:13,897 --> 00:06:16,697
Mr. Takaoka arrived home a little before that.

95
00:06:16,697 --> 00:06:19,697
He seems to have been caught in a traffic jam on his way here

96
00:06:19,697 --> 00:06:23,097
and arrived 15 minutes after the promised time.

97
00:06:24,897 --> 00:06:26,597
Officer Takagi.

98
00:06:26,597 --> 00:06:28,897
And Mr. Kizuka's alibi?

99
00:06:28,897 --> 00:06:31,097
Yes, I've already confirmed it.

100
00:06:31,097 --> 00:06:32,997
He was at his part time job

101
00:06:32,997 --> 00:06:35,097
at a large electric appliance shop

102
00:06:35,097 --> 00:06:37,097
and from 11am to 1pm,

103
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:40,397
he was taking out merchandise from the warehouse.

104
00:06:40,397 --> 00:06:42,097
Hey, Mr. Kizuka?

105
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:44,097
When you got here,

106
00:06:44,097 --> 00:06:46,897
the front door wasn't locked, was it?

107
00:06:46,897 --> 00:06:49,497
That... yeah, that's right.

108
00:06:49,497 --> 00:06:53,297
Then, I wonder if Hiroko forgot to lock the door,

109
00:06:53,297 --> 00:06:56,397
because when a woman are home alone,

110
00:06:56,397 --> 00:06:58,397
wouldn't she normally lock the front door to be safe?

111
00:06:58,397 --> 00:07:01,197
She did often forget to lock the door.

112
00:07:01,197 --> 00:07:04,197
If only I had warned her more strongly,

113
00:07:04,197 --> 00:07:05,797
this wouldn't have had to happen.

114
00:07:05,797 --> 00:07:07,697
"Weekly TV Parlor magazine"

115
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,897
Only stand-up comedy shows are circled in red.

116
00:07:13,897 --> 00:07:16,197
I guess, not to forget?

117
00:07:16,197 --> 00:07:18,997
I wonder if she liked to watch programs like these.

118
00:07:18,997 --> 00:07:20,197
I wonder...

119
00:07:20,197 --> 00:07:21,597
I guess so.

120
00:07:21,597 --> 00:07:22,997
"Neta Battle SP. Big Laugh with Comedian in Studio"

121
00:07:26,297 --> 00:07:27,997
It seems that she was planning to watch

122
00:07:27,997 --> 00:07:29,997
from 3pm to 5pm today too.

123
00:07:29,997 --> 00:07:31,497
Sigh...

124
00:07:31,497 --> 00:07:34,597
She couldn't even watch her favorite program.

125
00:07:34,597 --> 00:07:36,997
Is it just plain robbery?

126
00:07:36,997 --> 00:07:39,497
No, something bothers me.

127
00:07:41,497 --> 00:07:42,597
Inspector!

128
00:07:42,597 --> 00:07:44,997
Oh... how was it?

129
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,697
Here. This...

130
00:07:47,697 --> 00:07:49,697
What's this picture?

131
00:07:49,697 --> 00:07:53,097
I was asking trying to get an alibi for Mr. Takaoka

132
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:56,297
around the time of the crime which was between 11am to 1pm.

133
00:07:56,297 --> 00:07:58,997
He was in Fukushima with the film crew, wasn't he?

134
00:07:58,997 --> 00:08:01,197
Yes, he was at White Sand Beach.

135
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:04,697
But, didn't seem to meet anyone there.

136
00:08:04,697 --> 00:08:08,597
I see, you can't get proof of his alibi.

137
00:08:08,597 --> 00:08:12,897
Then he says he took money out at a nearby bank.

138
00:08:12,897 --> 00:08:15,297
So, I confirmed with the White Sand Beach prefectural police

139
00:08:15,297 --> 00:08:18,397
and confirmed it in this picture.

140
00:08:20,497 --> 00:08:22,797
I'm on the monitor of the surveillance camera.

141
00:08:23,897 --> 00:08:25,597
Yes, true.

142
00:08:25,597 --> 00:08:27,297
I usually hate to be taken this way,

143
00:08:27,297 --> 00:08:29,197
because I don't like being watched,

144
00:08:29,197 --> 00:08:32,397
but just this time, I'm grateful to the surveillance camera.

145
00:08:32,397 --> 00:08:35,797
Mr. Takaoka, it's not that I suspect you,

146
00:08:35,797 --> 00:08:38,697
but after went back to the hotel last night,

147
00:08:38,697 --> 00:08:40,397
did you meet anyone?

148
00:08:40,397 --> 00:08:41,997
No, I met no one.

149
00:08:41,997 --> 00:08:43,897
You didn't see anyone?

150
00:08:43,897 --> 00:08:46,097
"Hotel White Sand" -Oh, that's right.

151
00:08:46,097 --> 00:08:48,697
I order room service at night

152
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:51,497
a little after 12am.

153
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:56,797
Yes, let me explain what I did yesterday in order.

154
00:08:59,097 --> 00:09:00,397
I usually use this

155
00:09:00,397 --> 00:09:02,497
when making arrangements with the cameramen.

156
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:08,597
Could it just be a passing robbery?

157
00:09:08,597 --> 00:09:10,897
Something's not right to conclude so.

158
00:09:10,897 --> 00:09:11,997
Sunflower...

159
00:09:16,697 --> 00:09:18,097
I see.

160
00:09:18,097 --> 00:09:20,797
This was what was bothering me.

161
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:22,297
And...

162
00:09:22,297 --> 00:09:23,897
An empty video case...

163
00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:28,797
Yesterday at sundown, at 5pm,

164
00:09:28,797 --> 00:09:31,397
I parted with Hiroko in front of the shop.

165
00:09:31,397 --> 00:09:32,797
Exactly.

166
00:09:32,797 --> 00:09:36,197
It was the time I went to the shop so.

167
00:09:39,797 --> 00:09:42,997
Conan, don't touch stuff here and there now.

168
00:09:42,997 --> 00:09:44,397
Yes, sir.

169
00:09:46,097 --> 00:09:47,997
This plug probably...

170
00:09:52,897 --> 00:09:54,497
I was interviewed by a newspaper agency

171
00:09:54,497 --> 00:09:58,497
in Fukushima after 10pm.

172
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,597
This is the name card of the journalist

173
00:10:00,597 --> 00:10:02,397
and cameraman back then.

174
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,297
It's not how someone would take off their shoes.

175
00:10:07,297 --> 00:10:08,897
Did the culprit kick it?

176
00:10:11,297 --> 00:10:12,897
Or...

177
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:15,797
What's this?

178
00:10:17,097 --> 00:10:21,097
I checked out of the hotel the following morning after 8am.

179
00:10:21,097 --> 00:10:22,097
This is...

180
00:10:22,097 --> 00:10:24,797
The tab and receipt.

181
00:10:24,797 --> 00:10:28,397
At 2.17am, you ordered curry.

182
00:10:28,397 --> 00:10:30,697
Mr. Takaoka's signature is on it too.

183
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,797
-Yeah. -In other words...

184
00:10:32,797 --> 00:10:36,797
his alibi in the middle of the night is undoubtedly proven.

185
00:10:41,997 --> 00:10:44,597
So that's the story, after all...

186
00:10:44,597 --> 00:10:48,597
Then, I was taken by the surveillance camera of the bank after 12pm.

187
00:10:49,497 --> 00:10:53,497
In other words, Mr. Takaoka didn't leave Fukushima at all

188
00:10:53,497 --> 00:10:56,997
from last night till afternoon today.

189
00:10:56,997 --> 00:10:58,097
No.

190
00:10:58,097 --> 00:10:59,597
Perfect.

191
00:10:59,597 --> 00:11:03,597
It's an alibi so perfect that not even an ant can get through it.

192
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,497
Oh, no, Conan!

193
00:11:07,497 --> 00:11:08,697
Don't touch!

194
00:11:08,697 --> 00:11:10,397
Oh, I'm sorry.

195
00:11:10,397 --> 00:11:11,597
But, it's all as well,

196
00:11:11,597 --> 00:11:14,797
because I had forgotten what Pops told me to do.

197
00:11:14,797 --> 00:11:16,697
He wants you to check this.

198
00:11:16,697 --> 00:11:18,897
Check what?

199
00:11:18,897 --> 00:11:21,597
The contents of Hiroko's bag and her shoes?

200
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,697
Yep. He said that it's important to conclude who the culprit is,

201
00:11:24,697 --> 00:11:27,597
so to do it immediately.

202
00:11:36,584 --> 00:11:39,684
Mr. Mouri, this is what you asked me to get.

203
00:11:39,684 --> 00:11:42,384
Huh? I didn't...

204
00:11:42,384 --> 00:11:45,084
Huh? But, Conan just told me...

205
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:47,584
Officer Takagi, where have you been?

206
00:11:47,584 --> 00:11:50,184
Prepare an investigation team for me.

207
00:11:50,184 --> 00:11:52,684
Check all the robberies there were in the past

208
00:11:52,684 --> 00:11:54,284
and search for eye-witnesses.

209
00:11:54,284 --> 00:11:55,784
Mr. Takaoka.

210
00:11:55,784 --> 00:11:57,984
I understand how depressed you are,

211
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,084
but for Hiroko's sake too,

212
00:12:00,084 --> 00:12:02,084
please make a splendid film

213
00:12:02,084 --> 00:12:03,884
and get back on your feet again as soon as possible.

214
00:12:07,884 --> 00:12:10,884
Mr. Mouri...

215
00:12:10,884 --> 00:12:14,584
Inspector, thanks to Officer Takagi,

216
00:12:14,584 --> 00:12:16,684
we have found many new facts.

217
00:12:16,684 --> 00:12:17,784
New facts?

218
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:18,984
Yes.

219
00:12:18,984 --> 00:12:21,284
By the way, Mr. Kizuka.

220
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:25,184
Will you please look inside the video deck, please?

221
00:12:25,184 --> 00:12:26,484
Huh... okay.

222
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:31,984
There's a tape in there, isn't there?

223
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:35,384
-Yes. -Let's see what's recorded on it.

224
00:12:35,384 --> 00:12:39,384
Please rewind it a little and play it.

225
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:41,884
"Bakuhatsu Konto"

226
00:12:42,884 --> 00:12:45,384
Oh, this is a re-run.

227
00:12:45,384 --> 00:12:49,284
I saw this program about a month ago.

228
00:12:49,284 --> 00:12:50,484
What...

229
00:12:50,484 --> 00:12:53,784
The leg of the chair that was knocked over caught on to the cord

230
00:12:53,784 --> 00:12:56,184
and pulled the plug out of the outlet.

231
00:12:56,184 --> 00:13:00,284
Hmm... most probably when Hiroko struggled with the culprit.

232
00:13:00,284 --> 00:13:03,884
But, then why is the program that was recorded then still there?

233
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:08,284
The culprit didn't know that Hiroko was recording the program.

234
00:13:08,284 --> 00:13:11,284
The video that was cut off is the 2-hour special

235
00:13:11,284 --> 00:13:14,984
about 3/4ths through the program.

236
00:13:14,984 --> 00:13:19,384
It started recording at 3pm and is cut off an hour and a half later.

237
00:13:19,384 --> 00:13:22,684
Which means that the room was ransacked about 4.30pm

238
00:13:22,684 --> 00:13:26,084
and not at the same time she was killed.

239
00:13:26,084 --> 00:13:29,084
The culprit killed Hiroko a little afternoon,

240
00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:32,484
then came back here again at sundown and ransacked the room.

241
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:34,484
It's not likely, is it?

242
00:13:34,484 --> 00:13:38,184
The culprit killed Hiroko between 11am and 1pm at another place

243
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,684
and after bringing her body here,

244
00:13:40,684 --> 00:13:42,484
ransacked the room

245
00:13:42,484 --> 00:13:46,484
to make it look as if a robbery took place.

246
00:13:53,084 --> 00:13:56,284
Officer Takagi, please show the inspector what you checked on.

247
00:13:56,284 --> 00:13:57,284
Oh, yes.

248
00:13:58,484 --> 00:13:59,784
Inspector, here it is.

249
00:14:01,684 --> 00:14:04,784
Plain sand? Is what it looks like.

250
00:14:04,784 --> 00:14:08,884
This is what was found on the insole of Hiroko's shoes.

251
00:14:08,884 --> 00:14:09,884
What?

252
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:15,484
Forensics checked on it

253
00:14:15,484 --> 00:14:18,284
and found that it's something called crying sand.

254
00:14:18,284 --> 00:14:19,384
Crying sand?

255
00:14:19,384 --> 00:14:21,784
Yes. It is composed of a lot of quartz

256
00:14:21,784 --> 00:14:25,784
and is valuable sand that is found on unpolluted beaches.

257
00:14:25,784 --> 00:14:28,884
There are 20 places with crying sand throughout the nation,

258
00:14:28,884 --> 00:14:32,684
but one of them is White Sand Beach in Fukushima prefecture.

259
00:14:32,684 --> 00:14:34,384
I would like to also add that it is the place

260
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:37,784
that Mr. Takaoka was yesterday on location.

261
00:14:37,784 --> 00:14:42,584
Mr. Takaoka, I take it that you called Hiroko last night.

262
00:14:42,584 --> 00:14:43,784
You probably told her something like,

263
00:14:43,784 --> 00:14:47,984
why don't you come to Fukushima because I finished work.

264
00:14:47,984 --> 00:14:49,484
"Hotel White Sand"

265
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:56,684
So, Hiroko recorded the program she wanted to watch

266
00:14:56,684 --> 00:14:59,784
and headed for Fukushima early this morning.

267
00:14:59,784 --> 00:15:02,284
You made plans to meet her after 12pm.

268
00:15:02,284 --> 00:15:04,384
That's right after your image was taken

269
00:15:04,384 --> 00:15:06,184
by the surveillance camera of the bank.

270
00:15:11,784 --> 00:15:15,484
Hiroko arrived at the beach earlier than you.

271
00:15:15,484 --> 00:15:17,784
After all, it's the beach that is the stage

272
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:20,684
for the movie her lover is going to be directing.

273
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:24,184
So, I'm sure she had special feelings dancing inside her.

274
00:15:24,184 --> 00:15:25,284
But...

275
00:15:32,084 --> 00:15:35,584
White Sand Beach is your hometown.

276
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:39,584
You knew when the place would be empty without people.

277
00:15:42,384 --> 00:15:45,184
Right after that, you drove your car

278
00:15:45,184 --> 00:15:48,584
and rushed over near here to this condo.

279
00:15:48,584 --> 00:15:51,284
You parked your car in an inconspicuous place.

280
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,184
Under the disguise of a deliveryman of an electric appliance store,

281
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:56,184
you brought the cardboard box with Hiroko's dead body inside

282
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:59,184
up to this room.

283
00:16:00,884 --> 00:16:02,684
In other words, the electric appliance shop deliveryman

284
00:16:02,684 --> 00:16:05,184
that was witness after 4.30pm was...

285
00:16:05,184 --> 00:16:06,584
Mr. Takaoka.

286
00:16:06,584 --> 00:16:08,484
You disguised yourself using the clothes and cap of the place

287
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:11,484
where you work part-time for, didn't you?

288
00:16:11,484 --> 00:16:14,784
Mr. Mouri, please stop.

289
00:16:14,784 --> 00:16:16,584
I've been listening to you silently for a while,

290
00:16:16,584 --> 00:16:19,384
but you're making me sound like I'm the one who killed her.

291
00:16:19,384 --> 00:16:20,984
Huh...

292
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:26,084
"Check the car, from Mr. Mouri"

293
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:27,084
Excuse me.

294
00:16:27,084 --> 00:16:28,984
Hey, Officer Takagi, where are you going?

295
00:16:29,984 --> 00:16:31,784
It seems he just remembered something else

296
00:16:31,784 --> 00:16:33,684
that I asked him to check for me.

297
00:16:33,684 --> 00:16:37,684
Let me continue then.

298
00:16:37,684 --> 00:16:39,984
After carrying Hiroko up here,

299
00:16:39,984 --> 00:16:42,484
you in order to make this place look as if a robber had broken in,

300
00:16:42,484 --> 00:16:45,584
struggled with her and killed her, messed the room up

301
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:48,584
and thought you successfully carried out your trick of deception.

302
00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:51,484
Then, you got rid of the cardboard box, clothes and cap

303
00:16:51,484 --> 00:16:55,184
that you used to disguise yourself somewhere.

304
00:16:55,184 --> 00:16:57,484
Then finally told probably told Mr. Kizuka that you got caught in traffic

305
00:16:57,484 --> 00:17:02,284
and deliberately appeared later than the time you promised.

306
00:17:02,284 --> 00:17:04,184
Hiroko.

307
00:17:04,184 --> 00:17:06,084
Hiroko!

308
00:17:06,084 --> 00:17:08,784
This is the way you made it look as

309
00:17:08,784 --> 00:17:10,984
if Hiroko was killed in this room

310
00:17:10,984 --> 00:17:14,984
while you were in Fukushima at the time of the crime

311
00:17:14,984 --> 00:17:17,384
and created a fake alibi.

312
00:17:17,384 --> 00:17:18,884
Ridiculous.

313
00:17:18,884 --> 00:17:21,184
Mr. Mouri, your deduction is based on the grounds

314
00:17:21,184 --> 00:17:23,084
that Hiroko was called by me

315
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,084
and came to White Sand Beach

316
00:17:25,084 --> 00:17:28,984
after which I killed her between 11am to 1pm.

317
00:17:28,984 --> 00:17:31,484
You seem to be under the impression that's right.

318
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:36,184
But, do you have proof that Hiroko actually came to White Sand Beach?

319
00:17:36,184 --> 00:17:37,484
I do.

320
00:17:37,484 --> 00:17:40,684
Inspector, will you please look inside the envelope

321
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,584
that Officer Takagi brought a while ago?

322
00:17:44,284 --> 00:17:45,284
This is...

323
00:17:45,284 --> 00:17:46,384
"Director Debut in Hometown"

324
00:17:46,384 --> 00:17:49,084
This is an article in Fukushima Nippo's morning paper today.

325
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:51,984
It was probably written at yesterday's interview.

326
00:17:51,984 --> 00:17:55,984
That clipping was in the pocket of Hiroko's bag.

327
00:17:57,384 --> 00:18:00,884
After arriving in Fukushima, Hiroko bought a newspaper

328
00:18:00,884 --> 00:18:05,184
because she knew that you were interviewed yesterday.

329
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,884
Although it is a small article, it was about you.

330
00:18:07,884 --> 00:18:09,384
For Hiroko, it was top news...

331
00:18:09,384 --> 00:18:12,884
more important than any other news.

332
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:15,684
The support she gave you all this time everything was worthwhile.

333
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:18,184
The time when her efforts were to be rewarded has come.

334
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:20,184
I'm sure she put the precious article in her bag

335
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:21,984
with a dancing heart thinking the bud has finally bloomed.

336
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:26,984
A large sunflower has grown.

337
00:18:26,984 --> 00:18:29,384
No, you're wrong. Hiroko never came!

338
00:18:29,384 --> 00:18:32,784
I bought the newspaper.

339
00:18:32,784 --> 00:18:36,084
And I cut it out and put it in her bag.

340
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:37,784
Mr. Takaoka.

341
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,584
Have you ever taken a good look

342
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:43,284
at the words written on the wall panel?

343
00:18:43,284 --> 00:18:45,784
Watching only you.

344
00:18:45,784 --> 00:18:48,584
It seems to be the feeling that the sunflower symbolizes.

345
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:51,484
It meant everything to Hiroko.

346
00:18:51,484 --> 00:18:54,284
Mr. Takaoka, shouldn't you admit to your crime

347
00:18:54,284 --> 00:18:55,884
and atone for the wrong you did?

348
00:18:57,184 --> 00:18:58,584
That's absurd!

349
00:18:58,584 --> 00:19:00,884
I didn't kill Hiroko!

350
00:19:05,384 --> 00:19:07,984
Oh, Officer Takagi, how was it?

351
00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:09,684
Yes, what?

352
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:12,284
Huh?

353
00:19:13,484 --> 00:19:14,784
Inspector, please take a look.

354
00:19:14,784 --> 00:19:17,084
I'm sending you the image.

355
00:19:17,084 --> 00:19:18,684
It seems to be sand.

356
00:19:18,684 --> 00:19:20,584
Yeah, white sand...

357
00:19:20,584 --> 00:19:21,884
It's a lie.

358
00:19:21,884 --> 00:19:23,784
There's no way something like that would be there.

359
00:19:23,784 --> 00:19:25,084
Because I've made sure the blanket...

360
00:19:26,984 --> 00:19:30,584
The blanket... what about it?

361
00:19:30,584 --> 00:19:32,584
Shook all the sand off the blanket?

362
00:19:32,584 --> 00:19:35,584
Although a very slight amount, there's some left under the blanket.

363
00:19:35,584 --> 00:19:40,584
Mr. Takaoka, I'm sure that the sand is crying sand.

364
00:19:40,584 --> 00:19:42,284
Will you please explain?

365
00:19:42,284 --> 00:19:45,984
Why was crying sand found in the trunk of your car?

366
00:19:47,484 --> 00:19:49,084
You're still talking like that?

367
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:51,884
You really want to end our relationship?

368
00:19:51,884 --> 00:19:54,684
Just because a little luck seems to have turned your way,

369
00:19:54,684 --> 00:19:57,184
don't say such things so easily.

370
00:19:57,184 --> 00:19:59,184
I feel bad.

371
00:19:59,184 --> 00:20:01,084
You've gotta be kidding.

372
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:04,884
How much do you think I devoted myself to you?

373
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:07,784
Next it's your turn to look after me.

374
00:20:07,784 --> 00:20:11,784
You're spending your entire life paying me back.

375
00:20:13,584 --> 00:20:16,584
I found a spare key inside Hiroko's bag,

376
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:18,984
so I borrowed it.

377
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:24,884
I found out that Hiroko intended to depend on me for life.

378
00:20:24,884 --> 00:20:27,984
I didn't want her to swallow my whole life.

379
00:20:27,984 --> 00:20:31,584
I wanted to protect my freedom.

380
00:20:31,584 --> 00:20:33,384
However, Mr. Mouri,

381
00:20:33,384 --> 00:20:35,784
your intuition sure is sharp.

382
00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:38,884
You saw through my trick by a fluke.

383
00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:40,184
Mr. Takaoka.

384
00:20:40,184 --> 00:20:43,784
When you saw that potted sunflower knocked down on the floor,

385
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,084
didn't you feel something?

386
00:20:47,584 --> 00:20:50,184
I don't know how it was in Fukushima,

387
00:20:50,184 --> 00:20:51,784
but this town was clear and sunny

388
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:53,484
with not a cloud in sight.

389
00:20:54,684 --> 00:20:55,884
What about it?

390
00:20:55,884 --> 00:20:58,484
This room faces south.

391
00:20:58,484 --> 00:21:00,684
Moroever, the curtain has been torn apart

392
00:21:00,684 --> 00:21:03,184
and there is nothing to shut the light out.

393
00:21:03,184 --> 00:21:05,084
If that potted plant was knocked over

394
00:21:05,084 --> 00:21:09,784
between the estimated time of her death which was 11am to 1pm,

395
00:21:09,784 --> 00:21:12,584
the sunflower would've been exposed to a lot of sunshine

396
00:21:12,584 --> 00:21:17,084
until you found Hiroko at 5pm.

397
00:21:17,084 --> 00:21:21,584
For the sunflower, sunshine is the energy to make it bloom.

398
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:23,684
Most naturally the flower...

399
00:21:23,684 --> 00:21:25,484
However...

400
00:21:26,684 --> 00:21:28,484
The flower is face down.

401
00:21:28,484 --> 00:21:29,984
From all the facts so far,

402
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:33,284
we can deduce that the potted plant was knocked down at a later time.

403
00:21:33,284 --> 00:21:35,884
That is, right before the dead body was found.

404
00:21:35,884 --> 00:21:40,184
As a result of re-checking everything from that point of view.

405
00:21:40,184 --> 00:21:42,184
I see, I understand.

406
00:21:42,184 --> 00:21:45,084
But, Mr. Mouri, there is just one mistake.

407
00:21:46,484 --> 00:21:49,384
It was when everything was completed and I was ready to leave.

408
00:21:49,384 --> 00:21:51,084
That sunflower...

409
00:21:57,684 --> 00:22:02,284
Maybe something made the soil inside become lopsided.

410
00:22:02,284 --> 00:22:05,684
I didn't touch it at all.

411
00:23:35,484 --> 00:23:39,184
"The Mouri Detective Agency" -Well, I guess he said so, but...

412
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,284
But, I think it was you.

413
00:23:40,284 --> 00:23:42,884
You fell down from the stand to disclose the truth.

414
00:23:42,884 --> 00:23:45,984
Right, Hiroko avenged her death.

415
00:23:45,984 --> 00:23:49,784
Does Pops have a guest or something?

416
00:23:49,784 --> 00:23:53,784
Hey, I really think so, but how about you?

417
00:23:56,384 --> 00:24:00,984
He's talking seriously to the sunflower.

418
00:24:46,784 --> 00:24:49,384
Next Conan's Hint:

419
00:24:49,384 --> 00:24:50,984
Kitchen Knife.

420
00:24:50,984 --> 00:24:52,884
The next episode is a difficult case involving a mountain crone.

421
00:24:52,884 --> 00:24:53,984
Yama's making an appearance.

422
00:24:53,984 --> 00:24:55,784
Oh, that klutzy police detective.
