1
00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:06,491
After the strange letter that Pop's received,

2
00:00:06,491 --> 00:00:10,891
we were lead to the Kora Inn in Gunma Prefecture.

3
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:15,391
We met Mr. Rokuro Tokubi and Mr. Kazuki Araiwa along the way

4
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:18,391
and found out that 11 years ago in the river near the inn,

5
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:21,191
Tatsuhiko Numayama, an elementary school student,

6
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:24,291
got swept away in a flood and died.

7
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:30,591
Could this have been the "murder" mentioned in the letter?

8
00:00:30,591 --> 00:00:34,391
Tatsuhiko's friends had set up a riverside grave stone

9
00:00:34,391 --> 00:00:37,891
was kicked by Tatsuhiko's father, Banzo, is somewhat strange.

10
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:39,591
"Kora Inn"

11
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:40,791
The next morning,

12
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,691
Banzo is found dead in the attic of the inn,

13
00:00:43,691 --> 00:00:49,191
drowned in the water from reservoir where Tatsuhiko's body was found.

14
00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:51,191
Could it have been the work of the water sprite

15
00:00:51,191 --> 00:00:53,591
that Ran mentioned seeing last night?

16
00:00:53,591 --> 00:00:54,891
Or...

17
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,791
Brooding over passing seasons

18
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:18,691
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

19
00:01:18,691 --> 00:01:20,491
Inspector Yamamura of the Gunma Prefectural Police

20
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:22,691
discloses the sad identity of the water sprite!

21
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:24,291
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:26,291
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,491
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

24
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:57,997
"The Water Sprite's Dream (Part 2)"

25
00:02:58,797 --> 00:03:02,797
It seems that the journalist was telling the truth.

26
00:03:02,797 --> 00:03:06,397
The editor-in-charge confirmed that they were talking on the phone

27
00:03:06,397 --> 00:03:08,597
for over an hour without pausing.

28
00:03:08,597 --> 00:03:11,997
So, he couldn't have drowned someone while making the call.

29
00:03:11,997 --> 00:03:14,397
Inspector Yamamura!

30
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:17,397
We got alibis from all the employees!

31
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,797
It seems that at the time of the crime,

32
00:03:18,797 --> 00:03:20,897
all of them were preparing breakfast...

33
00:03:20,897 --> 00:03:22,997
Come again?

34
00:03:22,997 --> 00:03:25,497
You see... At the time of the crime...

35
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,697
-From before that! -What?

36
00:03:27,697 --> 00:03:30,297
The alibis of the employees...

37
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:32,397
Before that.

38
00:03:32,397 --> 00:03:35,997
Let see... Inspector Yamamura...

39
00:03:37,197 --> 00:03:38,897
That's it...

40
00:03:38,897 --> 00:03:41,497
Did you want to report something to Inspector Yamamura?

41
00:03:41,497 --> 00:03:43,997
Yes... well, sort of...

42
00:03:43,997 --> 00:03:46,697
To think that this hack was promoted to inspector.

43
00:03:46,697 --> 00:03:47,997
We've also confirmed

44
00:03:47,997 --> 00:03:51,497
that the water in question matched the water in the reservoir!

45
00:03:53,697 --> 00:03:58,497
Then, was there anyone who snuck out of the inn last night?

46
00:03:58,497 --> 00:03:59,897
The only ones who went out last night

47
00:03:59,897 --> 00:04:02,897
were your group and Mr. Nohira.

48
00:04:02,897 --> 00:04:05,997
He said that he wanted to take pictures of this area

49
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:08,497
and left before you did.

50
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:12,397
It seems that he came back drenched after all of you came back.

51
00:04:12,397 --> 00:04:16,097
Why did you all go out of the inn, Mr. Mouri?

52
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:19,697
Because Ran said that she dropped her cell phone near the river,

53
00:04:19,697 --> 00:04:21,497
so we went out to look for it.

54
00:04:21,497 --> 00:04:24,497
That's when I saw it...

55
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,797
A real water sprite!

56
00:04:26,797 --> 00:04:28,697
A water sprite again?

57
00:04:28,697 --> 00:04:30,997
It is! It's really true!

58
00:04:30,997 --> 00:04:34,797
It was standing near the river where I dropped my cell phone.

59
00:04:34,797 --> 00:04:37,897
Then, didn't you take any pictures of it as proof?

60
00:04:37,897 --> 00:04:39,997
You had the cell phone with you, didn't you?

61
00:04:39,997 --> 00:04:42,197
I was so scared that it didn't dawn on me to...

62
00:04:42,197 --> 00:04:45,797
I could draw it if you like.

63
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:49,097
"Rokuro Tokubi (42)" -I can draw in my wet sketchbook.

64
00:04:53,397 --> 00:04:56,797
Yes, the beak was a bit larger!

65
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,097
About this big?

66
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,497
Yes... that's right!

67
00:05:00,497 --> 00:05:03,897
Strange. In order to use a water bucket to drown somebody,

68
00:05:03,897 --> 00:05:05,797
at least a liter of water is needed,

69
00:05:05,797 --> 00:05:08,897
but why can't the container with the water in it be located?

70
00:05:08,897 --> 00:05:11,697
Mr. Tokubi's water ink bottles are filled,

71
00:05:11,697 --> 00:05:13,897
and he's actually drawing with them right now too.

72
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,997
Mr. Araiwa's PET bottle was opened

73
00:05:16,997 --> 00:05:19,497
but it's still half filled with oolong tea.

74
00:05:19,497 --> 00:05:23,097
All the water from his water pillow had been drained.

75
00:05:23,097 --> 00:05:25,797
The most suspicious would be the multitude of film cases

76
00:05:25,797 --> 00:05:27,497
that Mr. Nohira had on him.

77
00:05:27,497 --> 00:05:31,797
But, he has an alibi proving that he was on the phone.

78
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:34,397
Besides, to begin with, Tatsuhiko, who was swept away by the river,

79
00:05:34,397 --> 00:05:36,897
was wearing his swimming trunks only.

80
00:05:36,897 --> 00:05:38,997
If he was in fact taking a swim in the cold,

81
00:05:38,997 --> 00:05:41,397
would he be wearing shoes?

82
00:05:41,397 --> 00:05:43,297
Besides, his shoes

83
00:05:43,297 --> 00:05:45,997
were soiled with green stuff here and there.

84
00:05:45,997 --> 00:05:48,597
Amazing!

85
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:51,297
It looks just like it! It was just like that.

86
00:05:51,297 --> 00:05:52,397
What?

87
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:58,397
Hey, Ran! Did you really see this thing?

88
00:05:58,397 --> 00:06:00,997
Yep! It was exactly like this!

89
00:06:00,997 --> 00:06:03,097
Could I take a look at it too?

90
00:06:11,297 --> 00:06:15,497
Hey, don't tell me that the water sprite is the murderer?

91
00:06:15,497 --> 00:06:18,397
No... It's...

92
00:06:18,397 --> 00:06:19,597
It's not a water sprite...

93
00:06:19,597 --> 00:06:21,597
This is indeed...

94
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:23,297
An alien!

95
00:06:23,297 --> 00:06:26,297
-What? -What? Alien?

96
00:06:26,297 --> 00:06:29,497
Yes! This is an age where space travel is possible,

97
00:06:29,497 --> 00:06:31,797
so it's not surprising

98
00:06:31,797 --> 00:06:34,397
if a space being from outer space were to come here!

99
00:06:34,397 --> 00:06:38,397
If so, where's the spaceship that the guy came on?

100
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:42,397
You shouldn't take their power of science lightly!

101
00:06:42,397 --> 00:06:44,897
It could be a spaceship this small

102
00:06:44,897 --> 00:06:47,097
and yet be carrying millions of space beings

103
00:06:47,097 --> 00:06:50,497
that are shrunk and jam packed!

104
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:51,797
No joke!

105
00:06:51,797 --> 00:06:53,897
Come on...

106
00:06:53,897 --> 00:06:55,597
I see.

107
00:06:55,597 --> 00:06:59,197
So it was tightly put into smaller containers.

108
00:06:59,197 --> 00:07:02,097
At any rate, since Ran witnessed this extraterrestrial life form

109
00:07:02,097 --> 00:07:05,397
whose nature remains totally unknown to us,

110
00:07:05,397 --> 00:07:09,497
I'm sure the culprit is none other than this alien!

111
00:07:09,497 --> 00:07:13,497
Therefore, this case will be stored in the dark depths

112
00:07:13,497 --> 00:07:16,397
of the Gunma Prefectural Police HQ as classified top secret X-File

113
00:07:16,397 --> 00:07:19,097
where it will never ever see the light of day!

114
00:07:19,097 --> 00:07:21,997
Hey... Are you going to put it away as unsolved?

115
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:24,097
I mean, there's no such file is there.

116
00:07:24,097 --> 00:07:26,597
But, why would an alien

117
00:07:26,597 --> 00:07:28,797
be interested in the owner of this inn, Banzo?

118
00:07:28,797 --> 00:07:30,297
Hey, don't take him seriously.

119
00:07:30,297 --> 00:07:31,497
You heard about the fact, right?

120
00:07:31,497 --> 00:07:33,497
That Banzo was always watching the river banks using binoculars

121
00:07:33,497 --> 00:07:36,697
from the attic, didn't you?

122
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:40,097
I'm sure that Banzo saw them back then!

123
00:07:40,097 --> 00:07:41,997
The multitude of aliens that look like water sprites

124
00:07:41,997 --> 00:07:43,897
that were playing in the river!

125
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:47,697
That's why he was probably you know what...

126
00:07:54,797 --> 00:07:57,597
Well, I guess it'll be simpler to work things out

127
00:07:57,597 --> 00:07:59,497
by putting him to sleep this time.

128
00:07:59,497 --> 00:08:00,797
Hey, Yamamura?

129
00:08:00,797 --> 00:08:03,397
He looks just like you when you're Sleeping Kogoro, dad.

130
00:08:03,397 --> 00:08:06,397
Don't tell me... It's the curse of the water sprite?

131
00:08:06,397 --> 00:08:08,297
-Yes, the water sprite. -What?

132
00:08:08,297 --> 00:08:11,997
Yes, when I called it, "water sprite", it suddenly hit me,

133
00:08:11,997 --> 00:08:14,597
the truth of this case!

134
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:18,197
Even his non sequitur tie-ins are the same.

135
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:21,397
-What? Am I like that? -Yep!

136
00:08:21,397 --> 00:08:25,797
Now, please call the remaining two suspects here.

137
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:29,397
I shall disclose the truth of the case to you!

138
00:08:29,397 --> 00:08:33,697
Over the name of the inspector of Gunma Prefectural Police!

139
00:08:36,197 --> 00:08:38,597
"Chrysanthemum Room" -You've figured who the culprit is?

140
00:08:38,597 --> 00:08:41,297
"Kazuki Araiwa, Bosuke Nohira" -And you gathered us here...

141
00:08:41,297 --> 00:08:45,297
Don't tell me that the culprit is among us?

142
00:08:45,297 --> 00:08:48,497
I thought all suspicions were cleared a while ago

143
00:08:48,497 --> 00:08:51,397
when the Inspector and the others made the rounds through our rooms.

144
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,397
Right, Yamamura!

145
00:08:53,397 --> 00:08:55,697
The point of this case

146
00:08:55,697 --> 00:08:57,997
is the water in the reservoir with a foul odor

147
00:08:57,997 --> 00:08:59,797
that is 10 km ahead of here,

148
00:08:59,797 --> 00:09:02,097
that drowned Mr. Banzo Numayama!

149
00:09:02,097 --> 00:09:05,097
In order to drown him using the water dipper,

150
00:09:05,097 --> 00:09:07,297
about 1 liter of water is necessary.

151
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:10,797
In other words, the one who put 1 liter of the smelly water

152
00:09:10,797 --> 00:09:14,697
in some container and brought it in here is the culprit.

153
00:09:14,697 --> 00:09:17,397
The bottles of color ink that Mr. Tokubi had

154
00:09:17,397 --> 00:09:19,997
were almost all full

155
00:09:19,997 --> 00:09:23,597
and he was in fact drawing using the ink.

156
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:27,097
Although Mr. Araiwa had two PET bottles of 500 ml of water

157
00:09:27,097 --> 00:09:29,697
and a water pillow in his bag,

158
00:09:29,697 --> 00:09:33,597
the PET bottle was still half filled, and when he entered the inn,

159
00:09:33,597 --> 00:09:37,497
the water pillow was flattened out.

160
00:09:37,497 --> 00:09:41,097
Neither of them could've brought the water in.

161
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:44,497
As for the journalist, Mr. Norihira, because of his job,

162
00:09:44,497 --> 00:09:46,897
had a lot of film cases,

163
00:09:46,897 --> 00:09:49,897
but at the time the crime was committed from 06:00 am to 07:00 am,

164
00:09:49,897 --> 00:09:51,597
he was on the phone right through

165
00:09:51,597 --> 00:09:55,397
with his editor-in-charge, so he has a perfect alibi.

166
00:09:55,397 --> 00:09:59,297
So, then, who among the three here is the culprit then?

167
00:09:59,297 --> 00:10:01,897
Don't you think it's strange?

168
00:10:01,897 --> 00:10:04,697
Putting aside Mr. Norihira who has an alibi

169
00:10:04,697 --> 00:10:07,397
unless somebody knew of the contents of their belongings,

170
00:10:07,397 --> 00:10:09,097
Mr. Araiwa and Mr. Tokubi

171
00:10:09,097 --> 00:10:13,497
wouldn't have been able to avoid suspicion.

172
00:10:13,497 --> 00:10:15,197
He probably brought the water in using a paper pack

173
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,997
or balloon and after committing the crime,

174
00:10:16,997 --> 00:10:19,497
he could've torn the container up,

175
00:10:19,497 --> 00:10:23,597
flush it down the toilet and act like nothing happened.

176
00:10:23,597 --> 00:10:25,897
True...

177
00:10:25,897 --> 00:10:28,997
But, we were able to verify the contents

178
00:10:28,997 --> 00:10:32,097
of your belongings beforehand.

179
00:10:32,097 --> 00:10:34,397
Why is that?

180
00:10:34,397 --> 00:10:36,397
Mr. Tokubi!

181
00:10:36,397 --> 00:10:41,797
You deliberately slipped and fell into the river,

182
00:10:41,797 --> 00:10:43,497
then, spread out the contents of your bag

183
00:10:43,497 --> 00:10:47,097
and showed it to us saying you wanted to check your belongings!

184
00:10:47,097 --> 00:10:49,997
You did all this to set up the murder trick.

185
00:10:49,997 --> 00:10:52,097
-What? -What?

186
00:10:52,097 --> 00:10:54,897
Then... don't tell me that...

187
00:10:54,897 --> 00:10:57,897
Mr. Tokubi is the culprit?

188
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,810
Mr. Tokubi lured Mr. Mouri here by sending him

189
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,710
a letter under the suspicious name of Mika Tatezato.

190
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,010
Then you waited for his car to pass by on a road

191
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:20,110
on the way to the inn and got into his car.

192
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,110
Saying that you wanted to visit the grave of Tatsuhiko,

193
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:27,110
Banzo's son, which is located on the bank of the river.

194
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,610
Because you had to act out

195
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,810
accidentally falling into the river,

196
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:35,010
you deliberately made Mr. Araiwa who coincidentally visiting the grave,

197
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:39,210
fall along with you to also protect him from being suspected.

198
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:43,910
But, how did you know about the letter?

199
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,310
I told him about it!

200
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,410
I told him that we came to this inn because we got a strange letter,

201
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:53,410
whose name could be morphed into "water sprite".

202
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,010
But...

203
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:59,810
All Mr. Tokubi had were color ink bottles this small!

204
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,210
Just where in this bottle can you pour a liter of water?

205
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,810
Nine 60 ml bottles.

206
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,910
Sixteen 15 ml.

207
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,710
Including a 100 ml squirt bottle,

208
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,910
that makes 880 ml.

209
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,410
If water was poured all the way to the top of the bottles,

210
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,210
it'll add up close to 1 liter.

211
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:25,310
That's enough water to drown a person using a water bucket.

212
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:30,210
But, Mr. Tokubi was drawing using the color ink, wasn't he?

213
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,310
He was using all kinds of colors,

214
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,810
and even the bottles that he didn't use

215
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,010
have the same color ink corresponds to the label, you know?

216
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,510
He didn't use the squirt bottle, did he?

217
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,210
Look. The empty squirt bottle there on the floor!

218
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,610
Color ink is usually diluted when using,

219
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,810
because it's too thick if used as is.

220
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,910
Despite this, Mr. Tokubi finished drawing that painting

221
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,910
without adding a single drop of water.

222
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:59,110
Why? Because the undiluted color ink

223
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,010
was only in the dropper that was attached to the lid of the bottle,

224
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:07,710
and after the crime was committed, they were diluted using tap water.

225
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,410
Tap water?

226
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,010
I see...

227
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,910
He sucked the water up beforehand

228
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,910
using the dropper and emptied the bottle.

229
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,410
Then he filled up the empty space with water from the reservoir

230
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,710
and drowned Banzo.

231
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,810
After committing the crime,

232
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,410
he poured in the tap water and mixed it

233
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,010
with the left over solution in the dropper

234
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,210
to keep at least the color intact.

235
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:33,010
So, at a quick glance it would look like color ink.

236
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:38,610
Of course the tips were sealed with tape or something

237
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,910
to prevent the ink from mixing with the water from the reservoir.

238
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,510
As proof of this, when he checked his belongings

239
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,510
after falling into the water,

240
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:51,310
Mr. Tokubi didn't take the color ink bottles out of the cases.

241
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,510
If he did, it'll reveal the bottles not filled with vivid color ink,

242
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:58,910
but rather, dirty water from the reservoir.

243
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,610
How stupid can he get?

244
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,310
If he didn't draw such a picture, he may have gotten away with it.

245
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,710
He didn't have much of a choice.

246
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:09,310
After committing the crime, he had to clean out so many bottles

247
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,910
in such a short time is virtually impossible.

248
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,310
I'm sure that there is still some left

249
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,910
in the color ink bottles the remains of the substance

250
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,210
of the water from the reservoir.

251
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,010
That's why he went out of his way

252
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,310
and offered to draw of his own initiative.

253
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,710
He wanted to give everyone the impression

254
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:29,810
that the contents of the bottles were indeed color ink.

255
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:33,310
Well, if we ask forensics to check the composition of the color inks,

256
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,510
the result should soon be clear.

257
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,610
That can't be!

258
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,010
Mr. Tokubi couldn't possibly be the culprit!

259
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,010
Because...

260
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:45,410
Because Mr. Tokubi never failed to come to Tatsuhiko's grave

261
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:48,010
for the past 11 years, you know?

262
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,010
Even after he quit being a teacher, he still kept visiting!

263
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,810
How could you even think that Mr. Tokubi would kill Tatsuhiko's father?

264
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,010
It was because of his father!

265
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,310
-What? -What?

266
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,710
Because he was Tatsuhiko's father.

267
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,810
That's why all the more I couldn't forgive him!

268
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:09,110
Tatsuhiko was swept away by the river because of that guy!

269
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,610
It wouldn't be wrong to say he killed Tatsuhiko!

270
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,410
Mr. Tokubi...

271
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:19,610
I found Tatsuhiko in the dimly lit art room after school,

272
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,210
the day before he was swept away by the river.

273
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,910
Tatsuhiko was desperately rummaging the paint

274
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,910
that somebody had forgotten in the dimly lit room.

275
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:32,010
I thought that he wanted to draw something

276
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,210
so I gave him some brand new paint.

277
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:38,110
But a few days after Tatsuhiko was swept away by the river,

278
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,810
the guy returned the paint to me.

279
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,310
Since none of the colors seemed used,

280
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,610
I thought that he decided not to draw,

281
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:52,510
and kept the paint in memory of Tatshiko without using them.

282
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:56,110
But, a few days ago, I happened to realize.

283
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,310
Only the green color paint

284
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:02,110
was replaced by one of a different manufacturer!

285
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:05,910
-What? -Why only the color green?

286
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,110
I dug up the grave

287
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,410
after he was swept away by the river,

288
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,310
I checked the shoes that Tatsuhiko was wearing.

289
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,310
I was convinced...

290
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,510
There was green paint on the inside of Tatsuhiko's shoes

291
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,510
because on the day that he was swept away by the river,

292
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:24,610
Tatsuhiko had painted his entire body green!

293
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,210
His entire body green?

294
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,110
Hey! Don't tell me that...

295
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,010
Yeah... that's right!

296
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,110
Tatsuhiko's father had made Tatsuhiko go around the inn

297
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:37,410
in the figure of a water sprite

298
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,210
to attract guests to the inn!

299
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:43,810
Moreover, during a cold season like this!

300
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,210
No way...

301
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:48,810
Then, all the eye-witness reports were...

302
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,210
Probably Tatsuhiko acting out the water sprite

303
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,210
because the guy made him do it.

304
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:56,710
The fact that the guy took one shoe off

305
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,610
who he found floating in the reservoir,

306
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,910
hid it closed to his chest.

307
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,310
He returned the paint to me after replacing the green paint

308
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:07,010
were all to get rid of the evidence!

309
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,810
That's why that guy was always looking

310
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,310
through his binoculars from the attic!

311
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,210
He wanted to make sure that the other shoe

312
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,510
wouldn't be found!

313
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,110
You were wrong.

314
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:22,410
I think that Tatsuhiko decided to act like a sprite on his own.

315
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:26,710
And, secretly too, for the sake of his father's inn!

316
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,210
What're you talking about, boy?

317
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,910
Because if he were making his son do it in secret,

318
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,710
he'd make his son go and buy the paint!

319
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,410
If anyone were to find him rummaging through the paint,

320
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,810
it would give away the fact

321
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,910
that he were acting out the water sprite.

322
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,310
Besides, paints don't have to be bought in sets either,

323
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:47,310
and it's not strange for a child to be buying ink!

324
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,810
Then, why did he take the shoe from the corpse?

325
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,810
For Tatsuhiko's sake, I think.

326
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:57,610
He would be laughed that he died acting out the water sprite,

327
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,510
and moreover, it's his son's memento.

328
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,810
On top of that, he couldn't risk to be found,

329
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,710
I don't think he would carry it around in his pocket,

330
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,110
but would've gotten rid of it long time ago.

331
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:09,410
Don't you think so too, Mr. Araiwa?

332
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:14,410
Because when you heard Ran say she saw a water sprite,

333
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,410
you said that it may be a ghost, right?

334
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,710
You knew that Tatsuhiko was acting out the water sprite,

335
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,210
didn't you?

336
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,810
Actually...

337
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,510
The day Tatsuhiko got swept away by the river,

338
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,710
I was right near him.

339
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,210
-What? -What?

340
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,710
Back then, there was a rumor going around

341
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:40,010
that maybe somebody was acting as the water sprite when it got cold,

342
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,310
the water sprite didn't appear.

343
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:45,510
So, Tatsuhiko said that he's going to put on his act that day.

344
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,210
I told him not to do it because it started raining,

345
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,310
but he said it wasn't raining that hard yet so he'd be okay.

346
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,410
He then told me to go tell the guests

347
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,810
at the inn that the water sprite appeared.

348
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:58,110
But, it began to pour on my way back to the inn so,

349
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,510
I went back to tell him that we should cancel it.

350
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:04,910
Then, I saw Tatsuhiko's foot stuck between the rocks in the river.

351
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,910
I rushed back to go get Tatsuhiko's father.

352
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:11,010
But, when I got back, Tatsuhiko was already nowhere in sight.

353
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,910
Later after searching for him together,

354
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:16,010
you found him downstream floating in the reservoir?

355
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:21,410
Yep. As he was removing Tatsuhiko's shoe,

356
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,510
Banzo told me not to tell anybody

357
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:27,910
that Tatsuhiko was acting as a water sprite.

358
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,010
Because if someone were to copy him and end up like Tatsuhiko,

359
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:32,910
it would make Tatsuhiko very sad.

360
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,810
I see...

361
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,410
That's why he was always watching over the river.

362
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,410
He wasn't only watching to prevent somebody from being swept away,

363
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,610
but also to stop them from acting as a water sprite.

364
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:46,210
That can't be...

365
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,510
No way...

366
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:51,010
But, what about the rumor about that old man

367
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:54,210
snooping around the grave night after night, then?

368
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,210
He was probably

369
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:00,910
fixing the grave that he had kicked down in order

370
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,810
to keep Tatsuhiko's friends away from the river.

371
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,710
Although it was a grave made of stones being piled up,

372
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:11,510
it was a precious grave that his son's friends had made.

373
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,910
As if in response to Mr. Tokubi's wailing voice,

374
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,810
as he was taken away.

375
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,510
The surroundings were dyed

376
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:33,810
with the sad color of the sunset.

377
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:00,010
Well, you impressed me, Yamamura!

378
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:04,210
I guess becoming an inspector rubbed off on you?

379
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,210
I have no idea what he's talking about.

380
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:09,110
Well, since the case has been solved,

381
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,410
how about going out and drinking up tonight?

382
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:13,510
Sounds good!

383
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,310
Hey, hold it!

384
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:19,410
The mystery of the water sprite I saw hasn't been solved yet.

385
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:22,610
What? Are you still talking such nonsense?

386
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:25,310
Come on... Enough already.

387
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,110
I'm telling you that I really saw it!

388
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,410
So, like everyone's saying,

389
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,210
you were so scared and frightened

390
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,810
so your fear made you see what you saw!

391
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:36,810
What's with you?

392
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:39,310
Talking to me like a grown up trying to reason with a child.

393
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,210
I mean, you're still only a child yourself.

394
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,810
Water sprite?

395
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,110
-What? -What?

396
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,710
It's appeared!

397
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:51,010
Hey, Ran, get rid of it using karate!

398
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:53,010
What? No way!

399
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,810
So you're the one who was disguised as a water sprite?

400
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,210
I went near the grave last night hoping

401
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,310
to get some good pictures.

402
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,710
Then, you guys came along and surprised me,

403
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:13,310
so I slipped and fell into the water!

404
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:16,110
Since your daughter made a fuss about a water sprite,

405
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:18,710
I figured I'd stay quiet since I didn't want to end up

406
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,910
being suspected as the culprit.

407
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,410
But,

408
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,110
this picture shows a thinner body.

409
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,310
The lower stomach part is popped out and there's furry looking stuff

410
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,910
showing from under the shell.

411
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,710
His body looks thinner

412
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,910
because he was drenched from falling into the water

413
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,910
and his clothes stuck flat against his body.

414
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,010
And, he looked to have a pop belly

415
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,410
because he had something inside there, right?

416
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,710
Yeah. Film cases and all sorts of other things.

417
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,610
So then...

418
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:47,710
What's that flurry thing under the shell?

419
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:50,410
I sometimes do survival games,

420
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:54,010
so I camouflage my entire body with leaves.

421
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,710
What an idiot!

422
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,610
Well, the case is closed.

423
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,980
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,120
"Tennis ball"
