1
00:00:06,791 --> 00:00:09,989
The moment of vengeance has come!

2
00:00:11,691 --> 00:00:14,691
The curtains will soon rise.

3
00:00:17,691 --> 00:00:21,091
The masque of death is ready to commence.

4
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:29,791
A crisis is gracefully revived.

5
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:32,011
The table is turned and the mystery solved.

6
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:34,013
The malicious intent of an unseen face is frightening.

7
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:36,015
Tragedy during a Masque performance.

8
00:00:36,191 --> 00:00:38,017
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:40,019
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

10
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:42,021
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

11
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:24,123
"The Malice Hidden Behind the Masque"

12
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:33,541
Masque...

13
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,641
"The Triumph of Folly" -in other words, a masque is a play

14
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:37,641
that used to be popular in England

15
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:40,541
in the days before Shakespeare.

16
00:02:51,941 --> 00:02:54,441
The play that's being performed right now is John Benson's

17
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,155
"The Triumph of Folly".

18
00:02:56,341 --> 00:02:58,157
"Shimizu Kinuko (26)" -In Japanese...

19
00:02:58,157 --> 00:03:01,241
"Troupe Company Manager" -Orokasa (folly) no Shouri(triumph).

20
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:03,241
I see.

21
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:12,171
You know, this performance is really something.

22
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:13,441
We borrowed...

23
00:03:13,441 --> 00:03:16,175
"Manabu Tabuchi (50)" -genuine rapiers to practice with.

24
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:56,641
No dialog?

25
00:03:56,641 --> 00:03:58,217
Yes.

26
00:03:58,217 --> 00:03:59,841
It's silent play.

27
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:01,941
I see.

28
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:11,841
He vanished?

29
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:14,233
There's a landing below the veranda

30
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:16,235
and he jumped down.

31
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,741
And this scene is?

32
00:04:27,741 --> 00:04:29,141
This is a scene in which the two unwanted characters, the prince

33
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:30,641
and the minister die,

34
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:33,041
and the king raises his cup in celebration.

35
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:36,255
Of course, it was the king who orchestrated

36
00:04:36,255 --> 00:04:38,841
the feud between the two.

37
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:53,841
The wine the king was just drank

38
00:04:53,841 --> 00:04:56,841
was poisoned by the minister beforehand.

39
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:15,941
What a bloody story.

40
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,541
The story is indeed bloody,

41
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:20,041
but the play itself is also said to be cursed.

42
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,641
Just what do you mean?

43
00:05:21,641 --> 00:05:24,303
They say that ever since the first performance in the 17th century,

44
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:25,641
this play has been cursed

45
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:29,041
and somebody involved in the play is destined to die.

46
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:38,641
The guy playing the prince really looks like a prince, doesn't he?

47
00:05:38,641 --> 00:05:40,841
"Robert Banno (21)" -That is our star actor,

48
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,641
called Robert Banno.

49
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:50,329
Oh, that's Hiroshi Komazuka!

50
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:52,331
-Dad, do you know him? -Yeah.

51
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,333
"Hiroshi Komazuka (50)" -Back when I was a student,

52
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,741
I used to watch his movies all the time.

53
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:01,641
The one playing the minister is Atsushi Yabuki.

54
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:03,941
"Atsushi Yabuki (28)" -As for the lift I'll be taking a plunge for,

55
00:06:03,941 --> 00:06:07,341
could you raise the platform a bit more?

56
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:09,141
The fact is, during practice suspicious happenings

57
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:11,541
have occurred one after the other.

58
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,353
That's why we called on you, Detective Mouri.

59
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:16,341
Leave it to me!

60
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:19,941
It shall be as easy as relaxing on a boat... No, I mean a cruise liner.

61
00:06:42,941 --> 00:06:46,141
Well, no problem at all.

62
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:51,041
Where is that kid go?

63
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,541
Conan!

64
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,841
It's such a big place, he could have gotten lost.

65
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:57,541
I'll go find him.

66
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:00,399
That kid is such a pain.

67
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:15,741
By switching this rapier with the real one.

68
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:17,641
Robert will...

69
00:07:25,941 --> 00:07:29,341
Kyoko, I don't know where you are now,

70
00:07:29,341 --> 00:07:32,431
but make sure you watch tomorrow's news.

71
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:35,741
Because there will be a news coverage of the accidental death

72
00:07:35,741 --> 00:07:38,437
of the man who had his fling with you!

73
00:07:40,141 --> 00:07:44,841
Robert. Come tomorrow, the sword of justice

74
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:48,141
shall pierce right through your sinful heart!

75
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,941
Who... who are you?

76
00:07:58,141 --> 00:08:00,441
Hello. Good-bye!

77
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:01,541
Hold on!

78
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:05,641
You're Detective Mouri's...

79
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:07,641
I didn't hear a thing.

80
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:10,141
There's no way you didn't hear anything.

81
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:13,541
Now that you've heard, there's no way I can let you go.

82
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:17,241
At least until the show is finished.

83
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:27,741
Stay put right here.

84
00:08:31,741 --> 00:08:35,541
Darn. My alcoholism is acting up again.

85
00:09:03,641 --> 00:09:05,441
Hi.

86
00:09:05,441 --> 00:09:07,441
Anything?

87
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:10,941
Have you seen a child about this tall?

88
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,641
Haven't seen him.

89
00:09:13,641 --> 00:09:16,841
Is that so? Sorry for the trouble.

90
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,241
There we go.

91
00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:35,341
That's right.

92
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,557
The real rapier is missing.

93
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:40,041
Rapier?

94
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:44,241
Could it be...

95
00:09:48,941 --> 00:09:50,569
How dangerous!

96
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:52,571
Darn it! I'm going tell them off!

97
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:57,041
No, wait a second.

98
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,841
Rather than shocking him to death on the stage lift,

99
00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:02,241
maybe this way I can be sure to kill him.

100
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:05,841
I'm not the one who mistook the rapiers,

101
00:10:05,841 --> 00:10:08,341
so I can claim it was an accident.

102
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,341
Now, the problem is

103
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:12,591
how to switch roles before the real performance begins.

104
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:14,593
He'll definitely take the bait.

105
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:16,941
All right, I'll talk him into it.

106
00:10:18,841 --> 00:10:20,141
What?

107
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:21,341
You don't have money to pay me back,

108
00:10:21,341 --> 00:10:23,141
so you're giving me your role?

109
00:10:23,141 --> 00:10:24,603
My apologies.

110
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:26,605
There's just no way I can get the money ready.

111
00:10:26,841 --> 00:10:28,607
As such, I'm giving you my role.

112
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:30,341
Don't be stupid.

113
00:10:30,341 --> 00:10:33,041
It's just before the performance, you know.

114
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:36,241
Hold it. This is a silent play,

115
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:39,041
I guess I can somehow handle it because there is no dialog.

116
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,541
Rather... All right.

117
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,541
I'll take it.

118
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,941
Well, hurry and tell the manager.

119
00:10:45,941 --> 00:10:49,441
Why don't we keep it as a surprise until encore?

120
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:53,141
In view of performance, I think it would be more interesting.

121
00:10:53,141 --> 00:10:55,241
I guess so.

122
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:01,141
Let's go with it.

123
00:11:01,141 --> 00:11:03,241
I'll just leave this here.

124
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:11,541
I want to undo the trap.

125
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,141
No, so long as I fall to the side,

126
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:15,341
I should be fine.

127
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:19,041
Conan, where are you?

128
00:11:24,241 --> 00:11:27,241
Even elephants are said to die with this.

129
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:29,741
So, as for that old man, he doesn't stand a chance.

130
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:33,641
A gift from the fans?

131
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:34,673
Yes.

132
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:37,441
But, I don't drink...

133
00:11:41,141 --> 00:11:44,141
Well, I guess I'll have some, after all.

134
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:50,689
-Mr. Komazaki, is everything going OK? -Yeah.

135
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:53,641
Please, Robert and Yabuki

136
00:11:53,641 --> 00:11:55,441
are acting their first starring roles,

137
00:11:55,441 --> 00:11:58,441
so please do guide them along the way.

138
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:00,699
Yeah, I got it.

139
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:01,741
Bye.

140
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,703
Just don't do anything foolish

141
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:07,841
that would embarrass me like you did during rehearsal!

142
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:09,741
I'll pay closer attention.

143
00:12:09,741 --> 00:12:11,941
Though you're all too ready to promise,

144
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:14,713
too bad you have zero acting talent.

145
00:12:14,941 --> 00:12:17,641
I'm not even sure how someone like you

146
00:12:17,641 --> 00:12:19,241
was allowed to go on the stage.

147
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:20,719
Put this away.

148
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:24,341
I quit drinking.

149
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:26,241
I understand.

150
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:30,141
What a nag.

151
00:12:30,141 --> 00:12:33,541
I would've landed the big role much earlier

152
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,735
if it hadn't been for you nagging about this and that's.

153
00:12:37,641 --> 00:12:38,737
Hurry up and realize that the audience

154
00:12:38,941 --> 00:12:42,241
is sick of watching your mildew ridden act.

155
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:46,441
Well, from the next performance, I'll be the one in the spotlight.

156
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:55,741
What's wrong? Everything will be just fine.

157
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,641
I suppose but...

158
00:12:57,641 --> 00:12:58,757
Where's Conan?

159
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:01,741
I've looked everywhere, but I can't find him.

160
00:13:01,741 --> 00:13:04,341
Could it be that something happened?

161
00:13:04,341 --> 00:13:07,941
Nah, no worries, he's always like this.

162
00:13:13,141 --> 00:13:15,941
The moment of vengeance has come!

163
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:21,041
The curtains will soon rise.

164
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,441
The masque of death is ready to commence!

165
00:14:01,565 --> 00:14:03,665
You don't have the slightest clue that this performance is about

166
00:14:03,665 --> 00:14:05,565
to become your last.

167
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,665
Everything's okay.

168
00:14:11,665 --> 00:14:13,565
Same here.

169
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:20,365
Conan, where are you?

170
00:14:33,765 --> 00:14:37,765
How did a guy like him...

171
00:14:39,865 --> 00:14:42,265
You said it, didn't you?

172
00:14:42,265 --> 00:14:44,865
My dream is to see out the remainder

173
00:14:44,865 --> 00:14:47,465
of my life on the stage.

174
00:14:47,465 --> 00:14:50,665
I'm merely obliging by fulfilling your wish.

175
00:14:53,465 --> 00:14:55,865
It's almost the climax.

176
00:14:55,865 --> 00:14:58,865
I guess everything will somehow work out okay.

177
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:00,465
Yeah.

178
00:15:04,665 --> 00:15:08,365
That Yabuki seems to really be into it today.

179
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,665
Could it be that he performs better during show time?

180
00:15:11,665 --> 00:15:13,765
No matter, it'll be in this state that you put a sword

181
00:15:13,765 --> 00:15:15,965
right through him.

182
00:15:17,265 --> 00:15:20,665
Whatever happens, don't blame me.

183
00:15:20,665 --> 00:15:21,765
It's an accident.

184
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:25,965
The acting of the two look as if they've switched, you say?

185
00:15:25,965 --> 00:15:27,265
Yes.

186
00:15:27,265 --> 00:15:29,365
Could I just be imagining things?

187
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,765
Yes, that must be it.

188
00:15:48,265 --> 00:15:50,929
Your pleas for mercy will be in vain.

189
00:15:59,765 --> 00:16:01,665
What? He shrieked?

190
00:16:01,665 --> 00:16:04,565
I did it! I finally did it! I've killed Robert!

191
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:10,265
I'm sorry.

192
00:16:10,265 --> 00:16:12,965
But it was an accident.

193
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,265
What was that sound just now?

194
00:16:25,765 --> 00:16:28,565
What goes around comes around.

195
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:37,365
It would be fantastic if this were actual wine.

196
00:16:37,365 --> 00:16:40,365
Just to be safe, I'll go take a look at the stage lift.

197
00:16:58,465 --> 00:16:59,865
Don't tell me that...

198
00:16:59,865 --> 00:17:01,765
-Dad. -Ran.

199
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,765
He's still alive.

200
00:17:13,765 --> 00:17:15,013
Ran, call an ambulance.

201
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:16,265
All right.

202
00:17:17,565 --> 00:17:19,017
It's too late.

203
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:21,765
The poison's already going through his body.

204
00:17:21,765 --> 00:17:23,021
This is the punishment for looking down on me

205
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:25,023
who knows how many times.

206
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:29,027
But, more importantly who switched the rapier for a real one?

207
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:31,965
I was the one who did.

208
00:17:31,965 --> 00:17:36,165
Robert, that's punishment for making my daughter suffer.

209
00:17:36,165 --> 00:17:38,165
What did you say?

210
00:17:39,265 --> 00:17:40,765
Robert!

211
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:47,045
Mr. Yabuki!

212
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:49,047
What's going on?

213
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:51,049
When I found out that the rapier was genuine,

214
00:17:51,265 --> 00:17:53,865
I switched roles with him

215
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,965
in place of repaying him what I owed him.

216
00:17:55,965 --> 00:17:58,665
Everything was going fine

217
00:17:58,665 --> 00:18:03,061
until I ended up falling into my own trap.

218
00:18:03,965 --> 00:18:07,065
Hurry and shut off the power to the lift!

219
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:08,065
All right.

220
00:18:09,065 --> 00:18:11,665
Just what is going on here?

221
00:18:12,665 --> 00:18:16,365
Robert.

222
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:17,765
Am I going to die?

223
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:20,765
A shock that small won't kill you.

224
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:22,765
Still, we'll need an ambulance!

225
00:18:29,665 --> 00:18:33,091
But, when was the rapier switched?

226
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:37,365
The last time I checked, it was definitely the fake one.

227
00:18:38,365 --> 00:18:41,565
It's the fake?

228
00:18:41,565 --> 00:18:43,465
Of course it's the fake.

229
00:18:43,465 --> 00:18:45,665
I was the one who secretly switched them.

230
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:47,465
And not only that,

231
00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:49,465
I weakened the electrical flow,

232
00:18:49,465 --> 00:18:52,065
and also switched the wine inside the decanter.

233
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:54,765
But I really panicked when...

234
00:19:02,365 --> 00:19:04,265
Darn it.

235
00:19:06,865 --> 00:19:09,127
After escaping from the coffin,

236
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:12,165
I used the genuine rapier to cut the rope.

237
00:19:12,165 --> 00:19:13,465
And...

238
00:19:13,465 --> 00:19:18,865
Right. The real rapier is missing.

239
00:19:23,865 --> 00:19:25,565
How dangerous!

240
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,965
Darn it! I'm going tell them off!

241
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:30,265
I believed everything was all right at that point.

242
00:19:30,265 --> 00:19:32,765
No, wait a second.

243
00:19:32,765 --> 00:19:35,565
Rather than shocking him to death on the stage lift,

244
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:38,865
maybe this way I can be sure to kill him.

245
00:19:38,865 --> 00:19:41,465
I wasn't the one who mistook the rapiers,

246
00:19:41,465 --> 00:19:43,965
I can claim it was an accident.

247
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:46,765
Don't tell me that even Robert...

248
00:19:46,765 --> 00:19:50,665
In a hurry, I switched it to the prop rapier.

249
00:19:50,665 --> 00:19:53,665
Then, just to be safe, I went to Mr. Yabuki's dressing room,

250
00:19:53,665 --> 00:19:55,165
and this time...

251
00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:58,665
Even elephants are said to die with this.

252
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:01,179
So, as for that old man, he doesn't stand a chance.

253
00:20:02,365 --> 00:20:04,265
Dealing with one criminal is relatively simple,

254
00:20:04,265 --> 00:20:06,565
but three is too many to handle.

255
00:20:06,565 --> 00:20:10,065
And even if they were stopped now, there will be a next time.

256
00:20:10,065 --> 00:20:11,865
So...

257
00:20:13,765 --> 00:20:16,865
I have to save him, even though he's a criminal.

258
00:20:16,865 --> 00:20:20,065
Well, I guess I'll take it.

259
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:24,765
-Mr. Komazuka, is everything going OK? -Yeah.

260
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:28,065
Please, Robert and Yabuki

261
00:20:28,065 --> 00:20:29,665
are acting their first starring roles,

262
00:20:29,665 --> 00:20:33,865
so please do guide them along the way.

263
00:20:35,665 --> 00:20:38,565
Afterwards, the show began.

264
00:20:44,965 --> 00:20:47,865
A bottle cap should be enough.

265
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:55,665
First, make Yabuki lose consciousness.

266
00:20:57,665 --> 00:21:00,065
Next, Robert.

267
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:08,065
Oh, no.

268
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:13,565
And then, Mr. Komazuka.

269
00:21:34,665 --> 00:21:36,465
The evidence is all here,

270
00:21:36,465 --> 00:21:39,277
so the three cannot deny what they did.

271
00:21:41,665 --> 00:21:45,065
Well, if they'd promise not to do something stupid like this ever again,

272
00:21:45,065 --> 00:21:47,285
and repent what they did, then...

273
00:21:48,665 --> 00:21:50,265
Conan!

274
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:52,665
Where were you all this time?

275
00:21:52,665 --> 00:21:55,665
Well, the restroom.

276
00:21:55,665 --> 00:21:58,765
I've been looking everywhere for you!

277
00:21:58,765 --> 00:22:00,665
I had my reasons too.

278
00:22:00,665 --> 00:22:02,265
Apologize.

279
00:22:02,265 --> 00:22:04,365
Yes. I'm sorry.

280
00:23:25,065 --> 00:23:28,665
"The Mouri Detective Agency" -You act in a masque, dad?

281
00:23:28,665 --> 00:23:30,265
Can you pull it off?

282
00:23:30,265 --> 00:23:31,765
Of course, I can.

283
00:23:31,765 --> 00:23:32,965
"Strange Attempted Murder Scenario" -Well...

284
00:23:32,965 --> 00:23:34,965
"Plays Out At The Theater" -let's give it a try.

285
00:23:45,403 --> 00:23:48,265
Is that supposed to be a masque?

286
00:23:48,265 --> 00:23:49,765
Yes...

287
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,780
Next Conan's Hint:

288
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,780
"The trace of a ring"

289
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:59,080
Next episode, Mom and Dad makes up!

290
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,500
-Really? -Yes, really!
