1
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:04,514
"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:05,514 --> 00:00:07,714
-I'm here. -What?

3
00:00:07,714 --> 00:00:09,114
Hey, Ran!

4
00:00:09,114 --> 00:00:12,314
What do you mean you'll be sleeping over at school tonight?

5
00:00:12,314 --> 00:00:15,995
Sorry. The karate championship is drawing near,

6
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:17,997
so everyone's pumped up.

7
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:20,014
Since there's no school tomorrow,

8
00:00:20,014 --> 00:00:24,014
we decided to stay overnight and practice.

9
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:26,005
We just got permission from our teacher.

10
00:00:26,214 --> 00:00:30,009
Hey, hey. What about our dinner?

11
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:32,314
I'm so hungry, I could collapse any minute.

12
00:00:32,314 --> 00:00:35,014
Just go to Poirot downstairs.

13
00:00:35,014 --> 00:00:36,614
Get your breakfast there too.

14
00:00:36,614 --> 00:00:38,017
-Hey. Listen. -All right,

15
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:39,814
I'll be back at noon tomorrow.

16
00:00:39,814 --> 00:00:41,814
So take care of Conan for me.

17
00:00:43,814 --> 00:00:44,814
Wait.

18
00:00:48,714 --> 00:00:52,031
So said to eat at Poirot for dinner.

19
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:54,314
Guess we'll be having boxed meals

20
00:00:54,314 --> 00:00:55,514
from a convenience store tonight.

21
00:00:57,014 --> 00:00:59,114
Because today, Poirot is...

22
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:08,047
"We'll be closed from 4th to 5th due to circumstances. - Poirot's owner"

23
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,414
That's right, Poirot's owner.

24
00:01:12,414 --> 00:01:14,414
He did say he'd invited the neighborhood association guys

25
00:01:14,414 --> 00:01:16,914
to a hot spring trip today.

26
00:01:19,714 --> 00:01:22,061
I know. There's that Iroha Zusi.

27
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:24,514
"Iroha Zusi"

28
00:01:24,514 --> 00:01:27,514
"Closed today - Iroha Zusi"

29
00:01:27,514 --> 00:01:29,314
And they're closed too?

30
00:01:29,314 --> 00:01:31,614
Looks like he invited a lot of people.

31
00:01:31,614 --> 00:01:34,073
Since there are a lot of shops with their lights off.

32
00:01:39,314 --> 00:01:40,079
Oh, no.

33
00:01:40,314 --> 00:01:44,083
Every single eatery in the neighborhood is blacked out.

34
00:01:44,914 --> 00:01:48,087
As it is, there won't be food delivery tool.

35
00:01:48,087 --> 00:01:49,714
Just in case, I bought the flyers

36
00:01:49,714 --> 00:01:53,514
from all kinds of eating places that were in our mailbox.

37
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:55,714
Shall we try them?

38
00:01:55,714 --> 00:01:58,097
Anything that looks good?

39
00:01:58,097 --> 00:02:00,099
Specialty Pizza "Colossoo",

40
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:02,101
Miso cutlet "Tsubouchi",

41
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:05,114
Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki "Kondo"...

42
00:02:05,114 --> 00:02:07,514
None of which I'm in the mood for.

43
00:02:09,814 --> 00:02:11,114
It's a bit of a distance,

44
00:02:11,114 --> 00:02:12,814
but why don't we give this a try?

45
00:02:33,114 --> 00:02:35,014
If all cases were men,

46
00:02:35,014 --> 00:02:36,914
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

47
00:02:36,914 --> 00:02:38,514
The good old style ramen shop,

48
00:02:38,514 --> 00:02:40,139
I can feel something reeking around there.

49
00:02:40,314 --> 00:02:42,141
He sees through the one and only truth.

50
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:43,914
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

51
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,145
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

52
00:04:10,906 --> 00:04:16,235
"Ramen So Good it's to Die For (Part 1)"

53
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:17,506
"Delicious"

54
00:04:17,506 --> 00:04:18,906
"Ramen"

55
00:04:18,906 --> 00:04:20,239
"To Die For"

56
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,206
"Ramen So Good it's to Die For" "Ramen Ogura"

57
00:04:25,206 --> 00:04:29,006
It's quite a venerable shop isn't it?

58
00:04:29,006 --> 00:04:32,251
The picture on the flyer was a lot nicer, right?

59
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:34,253
Should we look for another shop?

60
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:35,606
Idiot.

61
00:04:35,606 --> 00:04:39,506
This kind of unvarnished shop is what we call a "hidden gem",

62
00:04:39,506 --> 00:04:41,806
it must be super tasty and well-loved.

63
00:04:41,806 --> 00:04:43,806
Plus, on a cold day like this,

64
00:04:43,806 --> 00:04:46,265
it's best to eat some ramen and warm up.

65
00:04:50,806 --> 00:04:53,406
Darn it.

66
00:04:53,406 --> 00:04:55,006
Guess you have a point.

67
00:04:58,906 --> 00:04:59,906
Welcome.

68
00:05:03,206 --> 00:05:04,283
It's cold.

69
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,706
-Chilly today, ain't it? -Yes.

70
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:13,206
And no other customers.

71
00:05:14,806 --> 00:05:18,306
Sir, anywhere but that seat please.

72
00:05:18,306 --> 00:05:20,299
It's the seat of one of our loyal customers.

73
00:05:21,806 --> 00:05:23,806
"Katsumasa Ogura (49)" -Well, although he was a loyal customer,

74
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:26,306
he passed away last month.

75
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:29,406
It's just my desire to reserve the seat

76
00:05:29,406 --> 00:05:31,706
in memory of him until the 49 days of mourning are up.

77
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,306
If you say so...

78
00:05:34,306 --> 00:05:36,306
Sorry about that.

79
00:05:36,306 --> 00:05:39,906
So that's why flowers have been left on the table.

80
00:05:43,506 --> 00:05:46,325
A customer... Two even?

81
00:05:46,506 --> 00:05:49,106
Guess I won our bet then, Sayo.

82
00:05:49,106 --> 00:05:50,329
Geez.

83
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:53,306
"Sayo Ohasi (28)" -My part-time pay is low enough already.

84
00:05:53,306 --> 00:05:55,406
Cut me loose once in a while.

85
00:05:55,406 --> 00:05:58,337
Anyway, give our guests some water.

86
00:05:58,506 --> 00:05:59,506
Fine.

87
00:06:00,906 --> 00:06:04,343
What kind of bet were you talking about?

88
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:06,706
It's about whether the number of gusts today

89
00:06:06,706 --> 00:06:08,806
would go into double digits or not.

90
00:06:11,106 --> 00:06:14,006
Dinner time's almost over,

91
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,355
and we just finally helped them make it ten customers on the day?

92
00:06:16,606 --> 00:06:19,106
May I take your orders please?

93
00:06:19,106 --> 00:06:20,359
Any recommendations?

94
00:06:20,606 --> 00:06:23,206
Your best bet is, our pride and joy,

95
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:26,365
that's so delicious it's to die for is "The Death Lord Ramen."

96
00:06:26,606 --> 00:06:27,906
We do have the plain miso or

97
00:06:27,906 --> 00:06:30,369
dipping ramen on the menu just in case.

98
00:06:30,606 --> 00:06:33,306
But if you somehow want anything other than...

99
00:06:33,306 --> 00:06:35,106
"The Death Lord Ramen."

100
00:06:35,106 --> 00:06:37,006
We'll still serve you as you wish.

101
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:42,806
Well, then w'll try some of that Death Lord ramen.

102
00:06:42,806 --> 00:06:44,383
Me too.

103
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:46,385
Two orders of the Death Lord ramen.

104
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:47,906
All right.

105
00:06:55,006 --> 00:06:57,206
So cold.

106
00:06:57,206 --> 00:06:58,906
It's a good thing

107
00:06:58,906 --> 00:07:01,006
we chose ramen like pops suggested.

108
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:03,406
Scumbag, what are you doing here?

109
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:07,106
Screw off. We don't serve ramen to the likes of you.

110
00:07:10,106 --> 00:07:13,306
What's with using that manner of speech to a customer?

111
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:15,606
"Tokumori Saizu (51)" -I made a special effort to come

112
00:07:15,606 --> 00:07:17,606
to this seedy shop where business is so slow,

113
00:07:17,606 --> 00:07:21,606
just to give you fine folks some much needed profit.

114
00:07:21,606 --> 00:07:22,906
We're losing customers

115
00:07:22,906 --> 00:07:27,006
only because those young jackasses from your place

116
00:07:27,006 --> 00:07:29,506
are always causing trouble in my shop.

117
00:07:29,506 --> 00:07:33,606
My bad, they're all brainless, energetic grunts.

118
00:07:33,606 --> 00:07:36,435
But we should've already properly compensated you

119
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:39,206
for the tableware my boys broke.

120
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:41,306
That's not the problem!

121
00:07:41,306 --> 00:07:44,806
Well, I did give these boys an earful.

122
00:07:44,806 --> 00:07:47,706
Telling them they should've made sure

123
00:07:47,706 --> 00:07:50,106
to seriously hurt the owner while they're at it.

124
00:07:50,106 --> 00:07:52,906
The did you say?

125
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:55,606
I'm joking, joking.

126
00:07:55,606 --> 00:07:57,906
All right, then...

127
00:07:57,906 --> 00:07:59,606
That seat...

128
00:07:59,606 --> 00:08:02,006
Oops, my bad.

129
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:04,006
I knocked it over.

130
00:08:04,006 --> 00:08:05,406
Wipe it for me, will you?

131
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:07,806
You're the one who spilled it,

132
00:08:07,806 --> 00:08:09,106
so wipe it up yourself.

133
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:12,471
My, what an insolent shop.

134
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:14,473
It's your fault for putting out shabby flowers

135
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:16,475
as decoration in a spot like this.

136
00:08:19,806 --> 00:08:21,406
Your order?

137
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:24,806
If you're not ordering anything, please go home.

138
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:26,006
Immediately!

139
00:08:27,706 --> 00:08:30,489
Then, I'll have that "so good it's die for" thing.

140
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:35,506
Well...

141
00:08:35,506 --> 00:08:40,499
Have you made up your mind yet, master?

142
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:41,706
Well...

143
00:08:41,706 --> 00:08:44,306
If you ask me, I won't sell this shop.

144
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:46,506
Since we and the Haido Shopping Street proprietors

145
00:08:46,506 --> 00:08:48,506
have joined forces

146
00:08:48,506 --> 00:08:52,106
and made an unwavering pact recently.

147
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:54,906
A great example of "ignorance is bliss".

148
00:08:54,906 --> 00:08:58,906
Your own shop is being called the black sheep, you know?

149
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:00,106
What?

150
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:04,006
Before I came in here,

151
00:09:04,006 --> 00:09:06,525
I got a haircut from Barber Taninaka next door, and...

152
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:10,006
The owner of that barbershop was complaining too.

153
00:09:10,006 --> 00:09:12,531
He was saying he'd like for this beat up ramen shop

154
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:15,106
to be run out of this stylish shopping street

155
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:16,806
since it just didn't fit.

156
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,406
Is that for real?

157
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:23,006
My, spewing nonsense, are you?

158
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:27,506
I only said, "If he remodeled once in a while,

159
00:09:27,506 --> 00:09:31,206
his business would've been more prosperous."

160
00:09:31,206 --> 00:09:32,551
"Atsusi Taninaka (47)" -My shop and yours

161
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:36,006
opened on this shopping street at the same time twenty years ago.

162
00:09:36,006 --> 00:09:38,006
My shop has remodeled three times already,

163
00:09:38,006 --> 00:09:42,006
yet this place has been the same, right?

164
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:43,106
Yes.

165
00:09:43,106 --> 00:09:45,806
I've been thinking about doing it,

166
00:09:45,806 --> 00:09:49,006
but things are a bit tight over here.

167
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,106
I understand perfectly.

168
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:53,606
Instigating a falling out between friends

169
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:55,706
in order to wreck this shopping district

170
00:09:55,706 --> 00:09:58,577
was Mr. Land Shark's aim all along.

171
00:10:00,906 --> 00:10:03,106
I'll have the Death Lord ramen.

172
00:10:03,106 --> 00:10:04,306
All right.

173
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:09,306
Here. Thanks for waiting.

174
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:12,606
Your Death Lord ramen.

175
00:10:14,106 --> 00:10:15,706
What is this?

176
00:10:15,706 --> 00:10:18,006
Bamboo shoots are piled sky high?

177
00:10:18,006 --> 00:10:19,406
I see.

178
00:10:19,406 --> 00:10:22,601
It's a pun on "Enma" (Death Lord) and "Menma" (Bamboo shoots).

179
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:25,406
Let's see... the chopsticks are...

180
00:10:26,606 --> 00:10:29,506
Mister, could you pass those chopsticks?

181
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:32,606
Here you are.

182
00:10:32,606 --> 00:10:33,906
Thanks.

183
00:10:33,906 --> 00:10:36,615
Well, anyway, give it a try.

184
00:10:37,806 --> 00:10:39,506
Yes.

185
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:40,906
Okay, I'll get right to it.

186
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:50,206
Let's eat.

187
00:10:52,406 --> 00:10:54,206
Here goes...

188
00:11:05,506 --> 00:11:07,506
-So Good! -So Good!

189
00:11:07,506 --> 00:11:10,649
-I've never tasted anything like this before. -Yes.

190
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:12,206
Right? Right?

191
00:11:12,206 --> 00:11:14,653
These bamboo shoots are especially delicious.

192
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:16,306
Right, right.

193
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:19,306
The secret to its tastiness is in these bamboo shoots.

194
00:11:19,306 --> 00:11:22,006
The recipe is a trade secret, of course.

195
00:11:22,006 --> 00:11:23,606
You're right.

196
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:28,306
I could get used to this flavor all the time.

197
00:11:28,306 --> 00:11:30,206
Thank you.

198
00:11:31,306 --> 00:11:35,206
We should invite Ran, Dr Agasa and the others here next time.

199
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:39,906
A run-down shop with a top-notch taste?

200
00:11:39,906 --> 00:11:43,006
Guess it won't be closing down anytime soon.

201
00:11:43,006 --> 00:11:44,206
No.

202
00:11:44,206 --> 00:11:47,106
Cheap, fast and tasty is our motto.

203
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,006
We're definitely going to keep on track.

204
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:52,691
Well, that's good to hear.

205
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:55,906
In contrast, my company is going down in flames.

206
00:11:55,906 --> 00:11:58,706
It makes me feel as if I want to die.

207
00:11:59,806 --> 00:12:03,006
Then, why don't you fold up your fishy business,

208
00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:05,206
and start a new trade instead?

209
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:09,706
It's not that easy to make it in this world.

210
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:15,406
Mister, you're left-handed?

211
00:12:15,406 --> 00:12:16,506
Yes.

212
00:12:16,506 --> 00:12:21,106
But earlier you wiped up the water on the table using your right hand?

213
00:12:21,106 --> 00:12:23,506
I was corrected by my parents when I was a kid,

214
00:12:23,506 --> 00:12:25,406
so I'm ambidextrous.

215
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:30,106
But I still use my left hand whenever I eat,

216
00:12:30,106 --> 00:12:32,106
or else I feel uncomfortable.

217
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:39,706
"Ramen so good it's die for"?

218
00:12:39,706 --> 00:12:43,906
If only someone could die after eating this for my sake,

219
00:12:43,906 --> 00:12:47,506
then this shop would go out of business immediately.

220
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:54,753
Why don't try poisoning this stuff?

221
00:12:56,206 --> 00:12:57,606
Look here you.

222
00:12:57,606 --> 00:12:58,757
I've been listening this whole time,

223
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:01,906
but you're just spewing bull shit and being disprespectful.

224
00:13:05,206 --> 00:13:06,765
Darn.

225
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:10,769
Hey. Let's take it outside.

226
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:13,806
I'll give you a piece of my mind.

227
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:15,206
Sir!

228
00:13:21,106 --> 00:13:23,906
Hey, are you even listening? Hey?

229
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,406
Call an ambulance!

230
00:13:52,406 --> 00:13:55,106
Hurry, call an ambulance. Hurry!

231
00:13:55,106 --> 00:13:56,106
Okay.

232
00:13:57,806 --> 00:14:00,106
Screw him.

233
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:01,306
Idiot.

234
00:14:01,306 --> 00:14:04,106
Do you think we're going to fall for that same trick, again?

235
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:07,206
What? Hold on, what are you saying?

236
00:14:07,206 --> 00:14:09,706
I know this guy's game.

237
00:14:09,706 --> 00:14:11,706
But he's just faking a collapse in my shop

238
00:14:11,706 --> 00:14:15,106
to raise a big fuss about having gotten food poisoning.

239
00:14:15,106 --> 00:14:16,606
What?

240
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,106
Taninaka, give me a hand.

241
00:14:19,106 --> 00:14:22,841
We'll throw this punk out onto the street and wake him up.

242
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:24,006
Sure.

243
00:14:24,006 --> 00:14:25,706
You can't touch him!

244
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:28,606
It'll be best if everyone returned

245
00:14:28,606 --> 00:14:32,406
to where they originally were without touching anything.

246
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,855
Also, in addition to the ambulance,

247
00:14:37,106 --> 00:14:38,106
call the police as well.

248
00:14:38,106 --> 00:14:40,006
The police?

249
00:14:40,006 --> 00:14:41,606
This man...

250
00:14:41,606 --> 00:14:43,706
I'm pretty sure he'd already dead.

251
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:54,873
"Ramen So Good it's to Die For" "Ramen Ogura"

252
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:58,877
"Ramen so good it's to die for"?

253
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:01,567
And immediately after eating it,

254
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,667
he collapsed in agency and passed away?

255
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:04,667
Yes.

256
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:07,667
Well, the ramen certainly was good, but...

257
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:09,867
Who would've thought he'd really die for it?

258
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,367
Don't be stupid.

259
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:14,067
People don't just drop dead from food that's too delicious.

260
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:19,167
And? What's the victim's name?

261
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:21,967
Tokumori Saizu, 51 years old.

262
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:23,667
He was apparently the president

263
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:25,967
of the real estate business he managed in Haido City.

264
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,367
It seems he had wanted to buy up

265
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:30,367
and raze the entire Haido Shopping Street,

266
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:34,467
and build a large shopping mall instead.

267
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:39,367
The people of this area considered him to be a major nuisance.

268
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:41,667
He was considered a nuisance?

269
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:44,923
Yes, in order to destroy this shopping street,

270
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:47,967
it appears that he would frequently use his employees

271
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,867
to purposely disrupt the businesses.

272
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:50,929
Yes.

273
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:53,367
When they came here,

274
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:54,933
they'd find some reason to pick on one of our customers

275
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,935
and start a fight.

276
00:15:56,935 --> 00:16:00,667
Can't even count how many of my ramen bowls they've broken.

277
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:04,267
It was the same at your shop, wasn't it, Taninaka?

278
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:05,467
Yes.

279
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:06,967
Purposely shifting while getting a shave

280
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,667
and causing their cheeks to get cut

281
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:10,967
and then raising a huge fuss

282
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:13,867
and demanding we pay for the medical bill, it's their rutine.

283
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:15,767
How did it go today?

284
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:19,567
Saizu said he had gone to your shop to get a haircut

285
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:23,467
before coming here to eat ramen, right?

286
00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:26,167
Yes, today, it went fine.

287
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:29,567
So this guy was a so-called land shark?

288
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:33,767
Yes, it seems the whole shopping street got together

289
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:36,567
and planned to file a lawsuit over his outrageous behavior, but...

290
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:39,667
The attorney representing them died last month,

291
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,467
and the lawsuit was dropped.

292
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:42,981
He didn't just die.

293
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:46,985
You could say he was murdered.

294
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:50,667
Because my dad trying to stop a fight here

295
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:52,267
while eating his ramen,

296
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:54,067
and a heart attack struck him due to his chronic disease.

297
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:56,995
He was taken to the hospital and died there.

298
00:16:56,995 --> 00:17:00,999
By "dad", you mean you're the attorney's daughter?

299
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:03,001
-That's right. -From when she was little,

300
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:07,367
that attorney would often bring her along to this shop.

301
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:11,567
She used to say she'd also open a ramen shop once she grew up.

302
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:13,767
But I never thought she'd really come

303
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:17,767
and ask me for any job, even a part-time one.

304
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:20,167
Incidentally, what was your dad's chronic disease?

305
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:22,067
Hypertension.

306
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:23,767
His death of cerebral hemorrhage

307
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:25,367
was probably due to his over-agitation

308
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:29,027
from dragged into the fight, the doctor said so.

309
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:33,031
But isn't it bad for people with high blood pressure to eat ramen?

310
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:37,035
My father took medicine to control his blood pressure.

311
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:37,967
And he was even told by his doctor

312
00:17:37,967 --> 00:17:41,667
that it was okay to eat ramen as long as he didn't drink the soup.

313
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:43,467
I understand.

314
00:17:43,467 --> 00:17:46,267
The victim's cause of death was poison, right?

315
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:49,967
Yes. According to the coroner,

316
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:51,667
he probably ingested the hydrocyanic poison

317
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:55,367
through his mouth as he was eating ramen.

318
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:56,467
So in short,

319
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:59,057
having been in this shop at the time of the incident

320
00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:01,667
and possession sufficient motive,

321
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:07,065
the three of you had the opportunity to poison the victim to death.

322
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:09,567
Please wait a moment.

323
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:11,067
Are you joking?

324
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:14,167
Are you saying there was poison in our ramen?

325
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:16,567
We shall investigate that now.

326
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:20,867
So, if you all would submit to body searches

327
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:23,467
and wait outside until we finish our investigation inside the shop.

328
00:18:23,467 --> 00:18:25,083
But...

329
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:28,667
is it wise to restrict it to only the three of us?

330
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:31,089
What do you mean?

331
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:33,091
Before Saizu collapsed,

332
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:37,095
that customer grabbed him by the collar.

333
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:39,097
Me?

334
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:40,467
That did happen.

335
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:42,467
Is that really true?

336
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:46,867
I was just thinking I'd give him a good talking

337
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:48,667
to since he was talking nonsense.

338
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:52,667
Then, you'll undergo a body search too, and then get out.

339
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:55,113
Yes, sir.

340
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:00,667
Geez, on such a cold day,

341
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:03,667
why did I have to be shut out too?

342
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:07,125
Pops, do you know how ramen is made?

343
00:19:08,867 --> 00:19:11,667
Why don't you ask the expert for that sort of thing?

344
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:14,767
But...

345
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:16,167
I see.

346
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:19,467
If he had laced poison somewhere during the cooking process,

347
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:21,967
there's no way he'd answer you.

348
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:23,867
Let's see.

349
00:19:23,867 --> 00:19:27,145
What I usually see on TV is to boil the noodles

350
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:29,147
upon receiving an order from the customer.

351
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:33,151
And then add the sauce and stuff like seasoning in the ramen bowl.

352
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:35,667
Then, after that was...

353
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:38,467
You'd put soup into the bowl.

354
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:44,167
Next, you drain the noodles and put them into the bowl.

355
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:47,567
And then finish it off with garnishes such as roast pork,

356
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:48,967
eggs, bamboo shoots and long green onions.

357
00:19:48,967 --> 00:19:50,467
Well, in the case of my shop,

358
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:53,667
Sayo is the one who does the garnishing.

359
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,867
Yes.

360
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:58,567
In short, if it had been you or Sayo,

361
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:01,967
either one of you could have laced it with poison at your leisure, right?

362
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,167
Well, I guess that'd be the case.

363
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:07,185
But we never laced anything with poison.

364
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:08,967
Really?

365
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:12,167
Never!

366
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:14,067
Say, say, mister.

367
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:18,567
Did you eat ramen with the late Saizu often?

368
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:21,199
Well... every once in a while.

369
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:25,203
In that case, is there anything Saizu really likes

370
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:28,867
that he'd definitely eat up before he even touched the noodles?

371
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:31,209
Like bamboo shoots or eggs...

372
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:32,767
Beats me...

373
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:35,213
I've never actually looked at how he ate.

374
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:39,767
Then, what about any habits he has when he eats ramen?

375
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:40,967
Habits?

376
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:43,967
Like, I was thinking if he always touches something out of habit,

377
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:46,867
it'd be easy to just apply the poison there.

378
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:50,267
Why are you asking me that?

379
00:20:50,267 --> 00:20:52,567
Because you were the only one, mister...

380
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:56,867
The only person who didn't get close to Saizu nor Saizu's ramen.

381
00:20:56,867 --> 00:20:58,767
You're right.

382
00:20:58,767 --> 00:21:02,367
Since you guys were sitting in the seats between me and him.

383
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:07,267
Yes, and if I recall, the closest you ever got to Saizu,

384
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:10,467
was when you hold out the chopstick stand to us,

385
00:21:10,467 --> 00:21:13,251
but Saizu didn't use those chopsticks at all.

386
00:21:13,467 --> 00:21:14,567
Yes.

387
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:18,867
But, I wonder why we didn't have

388
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:20,967
any chopsticks in the stand in front of us?

389
00:21:20,967 --> 00:21:22,967
Because there was a customer who dropped that stand,

390
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:25,767
and scattered the chopsticks all over the floor.

391
00:21:25,767 --> 00:21:27,867
-What? -And before I could refill it

392
00:21:27,867 --> 00:21:30,767
with some replacement chopsticks, you guys came.

393
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:35,067
Unsurprisingly, the customer was one of Saizu's subordinates.

394
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:37,767
We made sure to charge him for the chopsticks.

395
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:41,279
Then, is refilling the chopsticks your duty, Sayo?

396
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:44,367
Yes, that's me all right.

397
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:47,967
But, I never touched the chopsticks that man used.

398
00:21:47,967 --> 00:21:51,289
Since that seat was my dad's reserved seat.

399
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:54,167
There weren't really any customers who sat there.

400
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:58,167
Then, that means the loyal customer who died last month was indeed...

401
00:21:58,167 --> 00:22:01,299
Yeah, it was that attorney.

402
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:04,567
Saizu sat in that seat without taking no for answer,

403
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:06,167
does he always do that?

404
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:09,667
Almost always.

405
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:11,967
After he found out it was the lawyer's seat,

406
00:22:11,967 --> 00:22:15,313
he'd purposely sit there as a form of harassment.

407
00:22:15,313 --> 00:22:18,767
In short Saizu sitting at that seat

408
00:22:18,767 --> 00:22:21,319
was something that could've been foreseen to some extent.

409
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,967
If that's the case...

410
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:34,467
Among those three who were in the shop at that time

411
00:22:34,467 --> 00:22:38,067
and had the chance to poison Saizu.

412
00:22:38,067 --> 00:22:40,367
Who on earth did it?

413
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,790
Next Conan's Hint:

414
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,423
"The Glasses".

415
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,720
Conan, once you takes off your glasses,

416
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,720
you just look like Shinichi when he was a child.

417
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,940
Indeed I am.
