1
00:00:23,363 --> 00:00:25,963
The answer lies behind the message.

2
00:00:25,963 --> 00:00:27,963
Who is to win? God only knows.

3
00:00:27,963 --> 00:00:29,363
He sees through the one and only truth.

4
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,163
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

5
00:00:31,163 --> 00:00:33,263
His name is Detective Conan!

6
00:01:57,076 --> 00:02:00,976
Somebody visited us to invite us to the final game of the high school

7
00:02:00,976 --> 00:02:02,276
baseball tournament and Takarazuka Revue show, all the way from Osaka.

8
00:02:02,276 --> 00:02:04,976
It was Heiji and Kazuha.

9
00:02:04,976 --> 00:02:08,276
However, after finding out that both events will be on the same day,

10
00:02:08,276 --> 00:02:09,876
the people from Osaka started to have a fight.

11
00:02:10,976 --> 00:02:15,176
In order to decide which one to watch, Pops comes up with a suggestion.

12
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,476
A deduction battle begins.

13
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:25,676
"The Deduction Battle (Part 2)"

14
00:02:26,476 --> 00:02:28,576
Kazuha.

15
00:02:28,576 --> 00:02:31,476
What's wrong, Kazuha?

16
00:02:31,476 --> 00:02:35,076
I'm just confused. This dying message is killing me.

17
00:02:37,576 --> 00:02:40,276
If we can't figure out what it means, we're going to lose this battle.

18
00:02:40,276 --> 00:02:45,076
No Takarazuka show. I just don't want to lose.

19
00:02:45,076 --> 00:02:46,276
Battle...

20
00:02:47,476 --> 00:02:54,276
Come on, there are no winners or losers in deduction.

21
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:55,976
Because...

22
00:02:55,976 --> 00:03:01,076
what we have to do is to find the one and only truth.

23
00:03:02,776 --> 00:03:04,176
That's true.

24
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:07,476
Hey, Hattori.

25
00:03:07,476 --> 00:03:09,376
You got it too, right?

26
00:03:09,376 --> 00:03:11,876
The true meaning of the dying message.

27
00:03:11,876 --> 00:03:13,776
Nope. Not at all.

28
00:03:15,076 --> 00:03:20,276
How come we don't have the actual blocks that have the ink spots on them?

29
00:03:20,276 --> 00:03:23,176
If these were the actual blocks, not the pictures,

30
00:03:23,176 --> 00:03:25,176
we could've looked at them like this.

31
00:03:25,176 --> 00:03:27,376
Maybe there was something hidden behind them.

32
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:33,276
Well, too bad we can't see the backside of the blocks

33
00:03:33,276 --> 00:03:35,876
because these are pictures.

34
00:03:42,176 --> 00:03:44,876
I see. This guy...

35
00:03:47,776 --> 00:03:50,976
It seems that the president

36
00:03:50,976 --> 00:03:54,476
was having a hard time putting the ink on the blocks, huh?

37
00:03:54,476 --> 00:03:56,876
His hands were tied behind his back.

38
00:03:56,876 --> 00:03:59,976
Plus, he had to read the characters on the blocks with his fingers

39
00:03:59,976 --> 00:04:03,076
in order to choose the right ones, right?

40
00:04:04,276 --> 00:04:06,576
Look at those blocks. Each of them has different characters

41
00:04:06,576 --> 00:04:08,976
and also a picture of an animal on it.

42
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:12,476
I would be confused and pick the wrong block for sure.

43
00:04:12,476 --> 00:04:15,476
If it wasn't blocks but pieces of Japanese chess,

44
00:04:15,476 --> 00:04:16,976
it would be so much easier

45
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:19,276
because there's only one character on each backside of the piece.

46
00:04:19,276 --> 00:04:20,976
Kudo.

47
00:04:20,976 --> 00:04:23,776
Only one character on the backside?

48
00:04:23,776 --> 00:04:28,076
That would be even harder, stupid.

49
00:04:28,076 --> 00:04:30,376
The pieces are not big enough to see

50
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:34,676
whether it was the victim's dying message or not.

51
00:04:34,676 --> 00:04:36,576
Are they?

52
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:44,176
Yes. Maybe the president just dropped the pieces on the ink accidentally.

53
00:04:46,076 --> 00:04:48,676
Maybe the dying message is actually on the...

54
00:04:50,176 --> 00:04:54,676
So you did find the motive to kill

55
00:04:54,676 --> 00:04:56,976
from the four workers who found the victim.

56
00:04:56,976 --> 00:04:58,276
Yes.

57
00:04:58,276 --> 00:05:01,476
First, about the accountant, Nao Aiko.

58
00:05:01,476 --> 00:05:03,176
She was the former wife of President Tsujiya.

59
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:06,576
She had an affair with another man and got divorced.

60
00:05:06,576 --> 00:05:08,876
They were having problems with alimony.

61
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:11,376
Atsushi Hasami, the sales clerk.

62
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:13,976
He had been told by the victim that he would be fired

63
00:05:13,976 --> 00:05:17,676
if this year's revenue goes below last year's.

64
00:05:17,676 --> 00:05:21,076
The planner, Isao Nakagami had been told the same thing.

65
00:05:21,076 --> 00:05:23,676
Also, there had been a lot of conflict between him and the victim

66
00:05:23,676 --> 00:05:26,876
because of the design of their new toys.

67
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:29,476
Lastly, the vice president, Hajime Iwatomi

68
00:05:29,476 --> 00:05:31,176
was not having a fight or anything with the president.

69
00:05:31,176 --> 00:05:33,376
But actually, he is supposed to be the next president

70
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:36,376
if anything happens to President Tsujiya.

71
00:05:36,376 --> 00:05:39,376
So all of them have a decent motive for murder.

72
00:05:41,176 --> 00:05:45,176
A, u, e, o, u, i.

73
00:05:45,176 --> 00:05:48,476
There you go. You're almost there.

74
00:05:48,476 --> 00:05:53,176
There had been a lot of conflict between the president and the workers.

75
00:05:53,176 --> 00:05:55,576
I'm curious what kept this company going so long.

76
00:05:55,576 --> 00:06:00,176
The workers had been drinking in Mr. Iwatomi's house,

77
00:06:00,176 --> 00:06:03,276
complaining about their boss and stuff.

78
00:06:03,276 --> 00:06:05,976
On June 29th, which was the day of the murder,

79
00:06:05,976 --> 00:06:08,976
the three workers went to Mr. Iwatomi's house to drink,

80
00:06:08,976 --> 00:06:10,276
and stayed over night.

81
00:06:10,276 --> 00:06:13,276
On the next day, all four workers came to the office together

82
00:06:13,276 --> 00:06:15,676
and found the dead president.

83
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:17,176
One more thing.

84
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:21,076
This may have nothing to with the case.

85
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:24,076
But each worker has a strange obsession.

86
00:06:24,076 --> 00:06:25,776
Obsession?

87
00:06:25,776 --> 00:06:29,076
Ms. Aiko gets cold easily so she has 50 pairs of gloves.

88
00:06:29,076 --> 00:06:33,376
She brings at least three pairs when she goes fishing.

89
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:36,676
Mr. Hasami is a movie lover and has 30 sunglasses.

90
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:38,176
Those actually include the limited models

91
00:06:38,176 --> 00:06:41,476
which some famous actors used to wear.

92
00:06:41,476 --> 00:06:44,176
Mr. Nakagami has at least 40 hats.

93
00:06:44,176 --> 00:06:48,576
He wears them when he goes to the turf, just for good luck.

94
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:52,976
Mr. Iwatomi was the victim's golf friend, had 30 pairs of white golf shoes.

95
00:06:52,976 --> 00:06:54,876
These are all expensive brand shoes.

96
00:06:54,876 --> 00:06:58,476
He polishes them all once a week.

97
00:06:58,476 --> 00:07:02,776
And lastly. The victim, President Tsujiya was obsessed with idols.

98
00:07:02,776 --> 00:07:05,576
It seems he had been collecting a lot of idol goods.

99
00:07:05,576 --> 00:07:11,276
I found a lot those idol goods in the president's room over there.

100
00:07:11,276 --> 00:07:13,776
That! See the one on the desk?

101
00:07:13,776 --> 00:07:17,676
Pens and pen stands with the idol's picture on them and stuff.

102
00:07:17,676 --> 00:07:18,876
I see.

103
00:07:20,776 --> 00:07:23,176
Hey, Kudo. Have you noticed it?

104
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:26,276
You mean the unnaturalness of the desk?

105
00:07:26,276 --> 00:07:28,776
But it's not only that.

106
00:07:28,776 --> 00:07:32,776
Right. There's one more thing that's kind of bugging me.

107
00:07:32,776 --> 00:07:36,376
I suppose this calendar is also the president's stuff, right?

108
00:07:36,376 --> 00:07:40,276
Yes. That calendar is actually his favourite,

109
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:43,476
so he kept it even after that month passed.

110
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:48,876
Hattori.

111
00:07:50,376 --> 00:07:53,776
Did you buy it? The novel.

112
00:07:53,776 --> 00:07:57,076
My mom also got me one first thing in the morning today.

113
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,976
Have you figured out something, Kazuha?

114
00:07:59,976 --> 00:08:01,376
Kazuha?

115
00:08:01,376 --> 00:08:04,176
Sorry, Ran. I can't talk right now.

116
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:05,976
I think I'm just about to solve it.

117
00:08:09,476 --> 00:08:12,876
What is it now? What time do you think it is?

118
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:16,376
Don't you tell me you are still suspicious about us?

119
00:08:16,376 --> 00:08:17,676
Well...

120
00:08:17,676 --> 00:08:22,076
I heard some money matters were involved in this murder.

121
00:08:22,076 --> 00:08:26,876
It's all because of our vague alibis. We have no proof as to it.

122
00:08:26,876 --> 00:08:30,276
But what can I do? I was really at the turf that day.

123
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:34,576
I was at a golf course, watching the final round of the tournament.

124
00:08:34,576 --> 00:08:38,376
I was watching movies. Actually, three movies in a row.

125
00:08:38,376 --> 00:08:42,376
I was out fishing. I just happened to go by myself.

126
00:08:42,376 --> 00:08:43,376
All right.

127
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:45,576
So who found the dead body first?

128
00:08:45,576 --> 00:08:46,876
Who is this boy?

129
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:50,676
Could you just tell me more about it, please?

130
00:08:52,276 --> 00:08:55,276
It's me who found him first.

131
00:08:55,276 --> 00:08:59,076
I was going to sit at my desk when I found him lying on the floor.

132
00:08:59,076 --> 00:09:00,676
I screamed.

133
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:02,676
As we heard Mr. Iwatomi's scream,

134
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:06,176
we all came here and called the police.

135
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:07,476
Right.

136
00:09:09,576 --> 00:09:13,276
Before I forget, is it your president who rips the pages off the calendar?

137
00:09:13,276 --> 00:09:17,876
Yes. The president gets upset if we do it because we might ruin it.

138
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:20,076
So Mr. Tsujiya always rips it off.

139
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:23,776
And he keeps it in his room like some kind of precious treasure.

140
00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:28,176
Was he also the one who wrote the schedule on the calendar?

141
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:34,976
We were all supposed to play some golf together next Sunday.

142
00:09:34,976 --> 00:09:37,376
I can't believe this actually happened.

143
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:41,576
Anyway, we've got to go to look for something.

144
00:09:41,576 --> 00:09:43,876
You guys do the talking, okay?

145
00:09:51,876 --> 00:09:54,276
All right. Let's do it.

146
00:09:54,276 --> 00:09:56,076
Yes.

147
00:09:56,076 --> 00:09:59,376
The fact the video camera was at a blind spot

148
00:09:59,376 --> 00:10:01,276
from the victim's point of view,

149
00:10:01,276 --> 00:10:03,876
and the unnaturally neat desk.

150
00:10:03,876 --> 00:10:08,476
The bloodstain on the leather coat the murderer was wearing.

151
00:10:08,476 --> 00:10:11,176
The suspects' strange obsessions.

152
00:10:11,176 --> 00:10:15,076
And the president's dying message.

153
00:10:15,076 --> 00:10:16,476
Right.

154
00:10:16,476 --> 00:10:19,176
Now, all we need is that thing.

155
00:10:19,176 --> 00:10:21,876
The thing that connects the pieces of the mystery all together.

156
00:10:21,876 --> 00:10:25,276
What? One of the suspects got a solid alibi?

157
00:10:25,276 --> 00:10:29,476
Yes. I'm at the TV station, checking the footage.

158
00:10:29,476 --> 00:10:30,976
I see him.

159
00:10:30,976 --> 00:10:32,376
Clearly.

160
00:10:34,876 --> 00:10:35,976
Kudo.

161
00:10:39,276 --> 00:10:40,476
Ran.

162
00:10:41,876 --> 00:10:43,176
I found it.

163
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,176
It's the June calendar.

164
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:48,676
There's a thin bloodstain, but I can still see it.

165
00:10:48,676 --> 00:10:50,076
That must be it.

166
00:10:50,076 --> 00:10:52,076
The murderer is...

167
00:10:52,076 --> 00:10:53,376
I got it.

168
00:10:54,576 --> 00:10:56,976
Ran, I think...

169
00:10:56,976 --> 00:10:58,876
I got the answer.

170
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:07,239
Seriously? You really got the answer?

171
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:11,839
The dying message the president left at the murder scene.

172
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,739
Yes. The four building blocks with the ink spots, right?

173
00:11:15,739 --> 00:11:19,439
That looked like a hidden secret code,

174
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:22,439
but it was simply indicating the murderer.

175
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:24,039
The murderer?

176
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:28,039
I don't think there's any person that looks like a building block.

177
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,939
No! It's the name.

178
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,039
Name?

179
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:34,239
None of the four names are related to "o", "mo", "chi", "ya" though.

180
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:36,839
Heiji mentioned it earlier. Remember?

181
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:39,339
The victim might have just put the blocks on the ink,

182
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:42,639
and not because he wanted us to read what's with the ink spots.

183
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,639
In other words, the backside of the ink spotted character

184
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,139
is the true dying message.

185
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:52,139
I understand. But we can't see what behind those characters.

186
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:56,039
I can ask the forensic officers to bring them here.

187
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,939
No, you don't have to do that.

188
00:11:57,939 --> 00:11:59,339
Look.

189
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:02,339
The blocks of "o" character

190
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:05,639
would look like this if I were to unfold it.

191
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,839
U, e, o?

192
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,739
You all know what kind of character will be in the blank space, right?

193
00:12:11,739 --> 00:12:15,439
Just in case, I checked the blocks over there.

194
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:17,739
As I expected,

195
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:22,939
the characters are lined up in the correct order.

196
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:24,839
Ms. Aiko, am I right?

197
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,639
Yes. Each block contains five characters with the same consonant

198
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,639
and an animal picture in the same order.

199
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:41,039
If you know which character is on which side, it is no longer a hustle.

200
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:43,439
The backside of "o" is "i".

201
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:47,939
Accordingly, "mo" is "mi" and "chi" is "to".

202
00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:52,339
Right! So the real dying message is "i", "mi", "to"...

203
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:53,539
And what's the last one?

204
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,139
It doesn't make sense.

205
00:12:55,139 --> 00:13:01,339
According to Kazuha, the last block "ya" is supposed to be "yu".

206
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:03,639
But I actually see "yo" on it.

207
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:06,139
That block is special.

208
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:09,939
Look. You see "wo" on the right side of "yo"?

209
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,939
That means this block consists of "ya", "yu", "yo", "wa", "wo" "n".

210
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:20,739
If we put those characters in the same order, the animal part will be "n".

211
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:22,339
That's it!

212
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:26,339
According to the same rule, "ya" is "wa".

213
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,239
So the dying message is

214
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:30,939
"i", "mi", "to", "wa", right?

215
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:34,639
-So that's... -Imiwato.

216
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,139
Iwamito...

217
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:38,639
-Iwato. -Iwato.

218
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,639
That's right.

219
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:42,639
That's what the president wanted to tell us before he was killed.

220
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,739
The vice-president, Mr. Iwatomi.

221
00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:48,839
It was your name.

222
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,139
I see.

223
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:54,139
You wanted to kill your president and take over the company, didn't you?

224
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:55,739
No, I...

225
00:13:55,739 --> 00:13:57,339
Kazuha, that was amazing!

226
00:13:57,339 --> 00:13:59,639
You actually solve the case before Hattori.

227
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,139
We won this deduction battle!

228
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:03,539
So that means...

229
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:06,839
We can go to the Takarazuka show.

230
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,439
Sorry, Kazuha.

231
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:10,339
Mr. Iwatomi is not the murderer.

232
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:15,039
I had a phone call from Chiba.

233
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,539
The 29th of last month around 5pm, when the murder occurred,

234
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:21,039
Mr. Iwatomi was in fact on TV.

235
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:23,039
-No way. -Why?

236
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:25,639
Don't ask me why.

237
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,439
You have a twin brother?

238
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:28,639
No, I don't.

239
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,639
Sorry to tell you this, but Kazuha's idea was wrong.

240
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,639
Oh, no.

241
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,539
No. She was right.

242
00:14:41,539 --> 00:14:43,839
The four blocks are really the dying message

243
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,939
the president Tsujiya left before he was killed.

244
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:50,339
Heiji.

245
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:53,739
But Hattori, Mr. Iwatomi has an alibi.

246
00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:55,839
Of course he has an alibi.

247
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,439
Because Mr. Iwatomi is not the murderer at all.

248
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,139
What?

249
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:04,739
You just said that it was the real dying message, didn't you?

250
00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:07,539
Yes. For sure, I did.

251
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:11,239
But I didn't say the message was correct, did I?

252
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:13,739
Hey, hey. What are you talking about?

253
00:15:13,739 --> 00:15:15,239
Hey, don't you remember?

254
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:18,239
How did President Tsujiya leave a message on the blocks?

255
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:19,939
Try to remember that.

256
00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:25,839
Well, I think he was tied down on the floor behind the desk.

257
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,939
He picked the building blocks

258
00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:31,539
and put them in the puddle of ink on the floor, something like that.

259
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:32,539
You got that right.

260
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:36,439
The problem is the ink stain that's on the president's back.

261
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:38,039
What's wrong with it?

262
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:42,439
He got that ink stain when he was fighting the murderer, right?

263
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:45,439
That's what I thought at first.

264
00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:48,439
But I noticed the unnaturalness on this desk.

265
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:51,039
Unnaturalness?

266
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:58,739
It's weird.

267
00:15:58,739 --> 00:16:01,939
The chair just hit it lightly, but the pen stand fell.

268
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:06,039
Well, the ink bottle fell off the desk because people were fighting

269
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,839
and hitting the desk hard, right?

270
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:08,939
Right.

271
00:16:08,939 --> 00:16:12,139
Then how come the pen stand did not fall during the fight?

272
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,939
That is certainly strange.

273
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:16,739
This just sounds like

274
00:16:16,739 --> 00:16:20,139
the murderer spilled the ink on the floor on purpose.

275
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:23,839
No way. Why would he do that?

276
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,139
That's like he's giving the president

277
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:29,339
a chance to write something about him.

278
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:30,339
Maybe...

279
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:33,039
It was on purpose.

280
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:37,739
That's right. The murderer deliberately spilled the ink on the floor

281
00:16:37,739 --> 00:16:40,639
to compel the president to leave a dying message about him.

282
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,639
But it's dangerous. The president could leave the murderer's name.

283
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,339
That's only if he saw the murderer's face.

284
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:52,339
Why don't you lie down on the floor like the president was?

285
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:54,139
What? Okay.

286
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:00,039
Maybe you'll get to experience how the president felt.

287
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,839
How he felt?

288
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:09,339
I got it! Shoes.

289
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,339
It's the shoes!

290
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:13,539
The murderer narrowed the victim's scope with this desk

291
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:16,439
and made him determine who he was only by looking at his shoes.

292
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,939
So, the murderer wore white shoes

293
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:24,239
to make him leave a fake dying message about the murderer.

294
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:29,939
That's why the video camera was set up in the victim's blind spot.

295
00:17:29,939 --> 00:17:32,739
The murderer was watching the president on the monitor

296
00:17:32,739 --> 00:17:35,139
to make sure that the president wrote the desired dying message.

297
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:36,739
And then, he killed the victim.

298
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:39,639
But who did it anyway?

299
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:41,039
Hey, look.

300
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,139
What?

301
00:17:42,139 --> 00:17:45,539
I found this strange calendar in the president's room.

302
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:46,539
See?

303
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:50,439
I thought you might know what this is.

304
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:55,539
Well, it's got a little stain, but other than that...

305
00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:58,339
Don't you get it?

306
00:17:58,339 --> 00:18:01,939
It's been wiped off, but it's a bloodstain.

307
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,739
Also, don't you think it's strange

308
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:09,439
that the president was murdered on June 29th,

309
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:12,739
but the June calendar at the murder scene was already ripped off?

310
00:18:12,739 --> 00:18:17,839
In fact, there's a schedule written down on the 30th of the June calendar.

311
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:22,339
Who in the world would do that without any reason?

312
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:23,639
Hey...

313
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:29,139
The June calendar was ripped, because someone had to hide the bloodstain.

314
00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:32,839
We got something that's got the same bloodstain on it.

315
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:35,939
The coat the murderer was wearing!

316
00:18:35,939 --> 00:18:38,339
The bloodstain on the shoulder looked kind of rubbed.

317
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:42,639
That's why I made the four workers stand in front of the calendar.

318
00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:44,239
Hey!

319
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:45,839
The only person who is tall enough

320
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:47,539
to touch the top of the calendar with his shoulders...

321
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:49,339
You moron.

322
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:50,939
It is you,

323
00:18:50,939 --> 00:18:52,539
Mr. Hasami!

324
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:54,739
No one else could do it.

325
00:18:54,739 --> 00:18:57,039
Good job.

326
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,339
When the president came back to the office,

327
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,239
you attacked him from behind with a golf club.

328
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:06,539
Wearing Mr. Iwatomi's white shoes and setting up the video camera,

329
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:11,839
you made sure that the president left behind the fake message.

330
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:16,139
You probably were relieved after killing the president,

331
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:19,039
and leaned against the wall.

332
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,939
That's when you got the bloodstain on the calendar.

333
00:19:22,939 --> 00:19:24,739
You didn't notice it until the next day.

334
00:19:24,739 --> 00:19:26,739
That's why you didn't dump it right away.

335
00:19:26,739 --> 00:19:31,739
In fact, it's easy to steal the white shoes from Mr. Iwatomi's house.

336
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:35,439
People came and drunk at Mr. Iwatomi's house so often.

337
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:37,539
You had a lot of chance to steal them.

338
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:40,439
But the height of his shoulders is not enough evidence

339
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:42,739
to accuse him for the murder.

340
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:45,539
Actually, the evidence are those shoes.

341
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:48,739
You were wearing Mr. Iwatomi's shoes until the president left the message.

342
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:51,439
It's quite a long while.

343
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:54,039
The smell of your feet are definitely on them.

344
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:57,239
The police dog will sense your smell right away, right?

345
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:00,639
I guess you had a decent reason for wearing those shoes

346
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:04,039
until they smelled of your feet.

347
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:07,039
You can tell us about it if you want.

348
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:11,639
I wanted to kill the president by framing Mr. Iwatomi up for the murder.

349
00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:15,039
I wanted him out of the toy production.

350
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,739
That's all.

351
00:20:16,739 --> 00:20:18,339
Why me?

352
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:20,739
I don't think I ever mistreated you or anything.

353
00:20:20,739 --> 00:20:23,239
It's not me that you mistreated.

354
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:24,639
It's the children.

355
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:27,639
The children who are going to be playing with the toy

356
00:20:27,639 --> 00:20:30,739
that you and the president were trying to sell.

357
00:20:30,739 --> 00:20:32,239
I don't get it.

358
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:35,439
Here, look at this building block.

359
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:37,339
See how the corner have been smoothed off.

360
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:42,839
But to cut down the cost, they told us not to do it.

361
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:45,339
That includes not only the blocks but the other toys, too.

362
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:48,239
They certainly look more appealing and could be more profitable,

363
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:50,639
but are dangerous for children.

364
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:52,539
I disagreed with the idea, but we were going to be fired

365
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:54,439
if we did not follow their plan.

366
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:56,939
But you didn't have to kill him.

367
00:20:56,939 --> 00:20:59,039
This company is having a hard time.

368
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,539
Hard time?

369
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:05,239
Guess what President Tsujiya said?

370
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:08,939
Iwatomi! You want money?

371
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:12,739
I got tons of it. I'm not lying, just look in the safe!

372
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:14,639
-What? -He had money?

373
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:18,939
Yes. I have no idea what and how he did it though.

374
00:21:18,939 --> 00:21:19,939
But it doesn't matter.

375
00:21:19,939 --> 00:21:25,239
I just didn't want to see the poorly-made toys and deceive kids.

376
00:22:57,339 --> 00:23:00,239
You really got that trick. I'm impressed.

377
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:02,939
It's because of the novel.

378
00:23:02,939 --> 00:23:09,239
The title of the novel my mom got me gave me the idea of that trick.

379
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:11,639
You better thank your mom.

380
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:14,439
You won this deduction battle because of it.

381
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:16,839
We can finally go to the Koshien Stadium.

382
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:18,339
Congratulations, Heiji.

383
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:20,639
Oh, shoot! I forgot.

384
00:23:21,739 --> 00:23:24,839
Now, I have to practice the boola boola.

385
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:27,339
Kazuha, wait.

386
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:32,839
Kazuha, I can ask Hattori for you to go to the Takarazuka show.

387
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:35,739
You are the one who solved the mystery of the dying message.

388
00:23:35,739 --> 00:23:37,939
You are actually half the winner, right?

389
00:23:37,939 --> 00:23:39,939
Forget it.

390
00:23:39,939 --> 00:23:42,439
What I really wanted to see

391
00:23:42,439 --> 00:23:44,939
wasn't the Takarazuka show or the baseball game.

392
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,739
It was Heiji's smile that he shows when he solves a case.

393
00:23:53,739 --> 00:23:57,039
Where did I go wrong?

394
00:23:58,339 --> 00:23:59,839
You stupid.

395
00:24:31,966 --> 00:24:34,066
Next Conan's Hint:

396
00:24:34,066 --> 00:24:36,166
"Retired Number"

397
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,166
The next episode of Conan is a two hour special Christmas present!

398
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:39,866
We'll be at the Koshien Stadium. Of course, I'm the hero!

399
00:24:39,866 --> 00:24:41,066
What? You are gonna be playing?
