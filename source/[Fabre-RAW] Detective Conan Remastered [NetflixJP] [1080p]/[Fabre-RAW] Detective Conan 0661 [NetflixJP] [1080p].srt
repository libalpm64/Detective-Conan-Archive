1
00:00:04,829 --> 00:00:05,985
What?

2
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:09,989
You're going to be late tonight, so you don't need dinner?

3
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:13,629
But you said the same thing the day before yesterday, too!

4
00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:16,829
I'm sorry. I've got an urgent matter to attend to.

5
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:17,997
Then, what are you going to do about

6
00:00:18,229 --> 00:00:21,229
the person who asked you to search for his first love the other day?

7
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:23,629
Weren't you supposed to inform that person on the progress of the case?

8
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:24,829
Idiot!

9
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:26,629
What makes you think that the great Detective Kogoro Mouri

10
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:29,429
can be bothered by such a trivial case?

11
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,011
Call the client and say that I've found nothing yet!

12
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:37,429
Make sure you chain lock the door!

13
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:39,229
Hey, dad!

14
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:43,529
Seriously. I wonder what's gotten into him recently.

15
00:00:43,529 --> 00:00:45,529
He always comes home in the wee hours of the night.

16
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:49,029
Maybe he found himself a lover or something.

17
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:51,429
Well, if he's investigating marital affairs,

18
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:54,033
he may work till late at night, doesn't it?

19
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:57,229
He's probably at the Beer Garden at Beika Department Store

20
00:00:57,229 --> 00:01:00,529
that was just opened last week.

21
00:01:00,529 --> 00:01:03,329
The beer garden is known for the fried noodles they serve.

22
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:04,629
And there's green seaweed on Pop's toothbrush

23
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,829
each morning after he comes home late.

24
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:11,429
I'm sure he doesn't want to be scolded by you for coming home drunk,

25
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:13,829
so he secretly comes home late at night.

26
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:16,729
Does that mean he was drinking up beer,

27
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:18,057
leaving his family up to themselves,

28
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:20,329
and having a good time all by himself?

29
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:24,063
Well, I guess Pops has got other things to do, too.

30
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:26,065
Great detective, my foot!

31
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:27,829
Sleeping Kogoro, my foot!

32
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:29,829
He's just a good-for-nothing father!

33
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:31,529
No.

34
00:01:31,529 --> 00:01:35,429
Mr. Kogoro Mouri is a very very good person!

35
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,029
"Takae Kiritani (70)" -There's no reason why he should be insulted

36
00:01:37,029 --> 00:01:39,729
"Apartment Landlady" -by some unknown girl student.

37
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:44,083
Unknown girl student? I'm Kogoro Mouri's daughter.

38
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,129
Daughter?

39
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:48,087
Are you really Mr. Kogoro's daughter?

40
00:01:48,087 --> 00:01:50,629
Yes, my name's Ran.

41
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:53,729
So, he's kept it a secret from you.

42
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,029
He comes to visit this old lady every week

43
00:01:57,029 --> 00:02:01,429
and helps me solve cases for free.

44
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:03,329
My dad's working for free?

45
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:04,629
It can't be.

46
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:06,929
Looks like that moustached man is pretty good!

47
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:10,109
But what kind of cases does he solve for you?

48
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:13,629
Just simple ones like looking for lost items.

49
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:17,029
Would you like to come over to my house and see for yourself?

50
00:02:17,029 --> 00:02:21,229
Mr. Kogoro will also come over to my house today.

51
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:22,629
Yes.

52
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,729
If all cases were men,

53
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:46,429
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

54
00:02:46,429 --> 00:02:48,429
Kogoro's imposter appears?

55
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:50,149
A grave case where Death is summoned!

56
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:51,629
He sees through the one and only truth.

57
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,429
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

58
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:56,155
His name is Detective Conan!

59
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:24,524
"Kogoro is a Good Person (Part 1)"

60
00:04:27,624 --> 00:04:30,824
So you're the landlady of an apartment.

61
00:04:30,824 --> 00:04:34,724
Yes, the one standing next door is the apartment.

62
00:04:34,724 --> 00:04:37,524
My husband, my son and his wife have passed away.

63
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:39,624
The only one alive, my granddaughter

64
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:42,261
seems to have no intention of taking over this place,

65
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:46,265
so I'm thinking of letting go of this apartment soon.

66
00:04:46,265 --> 00:04:47,724
I see.

67
00:04:47,724 --> 00:04:51,424
Mr. Kogoro loves the okonomiyaki that I make.

68
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,624
He eats at least two pieces every time he visits.

69
00:04:53,624 --> 00:04:57,024
I'm sorry that you have to make some for us, too.

70
00:04:57,024 --> 00:05:00,924
So the green seaweed came from this granny's okonomiyaki?

71
00:05:00,924 --> 00:05:02,624
But what a surprise.

72
00:05:02,624 --> 00:05:04,283
To think that dad was secretly doing

73
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:06,824
good deeds like this for the elderly.

74
00:05:06,824 --> 00:05:09,924
No. There must be something behind all this.

75
00:05:12,024 --> 00:05:13,924
He's here.

76
00:05:13,924 --> 00:05:17,524
I'll open the door and surprise him then.

77
00:05:19,424 --> 00:05:21,024
Yes!

78
00:05:25,824 --> 00:05:27,124
Who are you?

79
00:05:27,124 --> 00:05:29,124
You... You are?

80
00:05:29,124 --> 00:05:31,224
Welcome, Mr. Kogoro!

81
00:05:31,224 --> 00:05:33,424
I coincidentally ran into your daughter on the street

82
00:05:33,424 --> 00:05:35,924
and had her come over.

83
00:05:35,924 --> 00:05:38,324
Kogoro?

84
00:05:38,324 --> 00:05:39,624
Daughter?

85
00:05:39,624 --> 00:05:43,024
You're wrong, granny. This man is...

86
00:05:54,524 --> 00:05:55,924
What?

87
00:05:55,924 --> 00:05:59,224
The granny's granddaughter asked you to do her a favor?

88
00:06:01,124 --> 00:06:04,343
What's your relationship with her granddaughter?

89
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:06,345
I... I'm her boyfriend.

90
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:09,324
I was her classmate at the university.

91
00:06:09,324 --> 00:06:10,824
"Ryohei Onda (21)" -When I came for the first time three months ago,

92
00:06:10,824 --> 00:06:13,424
"University Student" -a thief broke into houses in the neighborhood.

93
00:06:13,424 --> 00:06:16,724
Her granny was so scared that she couldn't sleep.

94
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:18,124
I set up two locks for her

95
00:06:18,124 --> 00:06:20,359
and taught her how to protect herself.

96
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:25,124
Even so, you didn't have to pretend to be my dad, did you?

97
00:06:25,124 --> 00:06:28,624
She persuaded me that it would be more convincing if I did, so...

98
00:06:28,624 --> 00:06:33,224
Besides, it seems that granny had sent a letter to Detective Mouri, too.

99
00:06:33,224 --> 00:06:35,924
But that thief was caught last month, so I don't think

100
00:06:35,924 --> 00:06:37,824
you need to be around anymore, do you?

101
00:06:37,824 --> 00:06:39,624
Right, but...

102
00:06:39,624 --> 00:06:42,924
I started rejecting strange soliciting calls for her after that.

103
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:44,924
I was also asked to do other things

104
00:06:44,924 --> 00:06:47,124
like looking for the neighbors' missing cats.

105
00:06:47,124 --> 00:06:49,924
Don't tell me that you're acting as an imposter of Kogoro Mouri

106
00:06:49,924 --> 00:06:53,024
in an attempt to deceive granny so you can swindle her.

107
00:06:53,024 --> 00:06:56,395
-No way... -I don't think he'd do so.

108
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:59,824
If so, I'm sure he would have fled

109
00:06:59,824 --> 00:07:02,124
the minute he ran into you, Ran, who is his daughter.

110
00:07:02,124 --> 00:07:06,924
Pops has many friends in the police force, too.

111
00:07:06,924 --> 00:07:09,224
So please cover for me just this once.

112
00:07:09,224 --> 00:07:10,409
I'm sure granny would be disappointed

113
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:12,124
if she finds out that I'm an imposter.

114
00:07:12,124 --> 00:07:15,824
I promise that I won't ever do something like this again.

115
00:07:15,824 --> 00:07:17,424
Seriously.

116
00:07:20,924 --> 00:07:23,924
Have you finished your father-daughter talk already?

117
00:07:23,924 --> 00:07:27,924
Yes, my daughter really surprised me out of my wits.

118
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:33,224
Then, please solve the case like you always do.

119
00:07:33,224 --> 00:07:34,224
Yes.

120
00:07:34,224 --> 00:07:38,424
Ran, watch carefully how your father works!

121
00:07:45,224 --> 00:07:47,024
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:48,124 --> 00:07:51,224
So that means that the real Pops is...

123
00:08:00,024 --> 00:08:02,024
Draft beer is fantastic!

124
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:11,524
Zapping?

125
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,924
Are you talking about channel surfing

126
00:08:13,924 --> 00:08:16,475
where you use the remote controller to switch channels

127
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:17,524
one after the other?

128
00:08:17,524 --> 00:08:20,124
Yes. Last night, when I was watching TV,

129
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,724
I wasn't touching the remote controller at all,

130
00:08:21,724 --> 00:08:23,024
and yet the channels suddenly kept changing.

131
00:08:23,024 --> 00:08:26,124
What do you call that?

132
00:08:26,124 --> 00:08:29,224
I think it's "poster east guide" or something.

133
00:08:29,224 --> 00:08:32,124
"Poster east"?

134
00:08:32,124 --> 00:08:33,624
You mean a poltergeist?

135
00:08:33,624 --> 00:08:34,824
Right, right.

136
00:08:34,824 --> 00:08:38,024
I thought a ghost appeared and I was so scared

137
00:08:38,024 --> 00:08:41,024
that I called Mr. Kogoro.

138
00:08:41,024 --> 00:08:43,224
Can you explain what happened?

139
00:08:43,224 --> 00:08:47,324
Well, it's probably your husband who died last year.

140
00:08:47,324 --> 00:08:50,024
Ghosts don't exist in this world.

141
00:08:50,024 --> 00:08:53,324
Ghosts only appear in cartoons, dramas and novels.

142
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,515
Right, Pops?

143
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:58,124
Yeah, of course.

144
00:08:58,124 --> 00:09:02,521
So, this is not the work of a ghost.

145
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:05,024
In other words...

146
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:09,024
Hey, Conan. Why don't you help him?

147
00:09:09,024 --> 00:09:12,324
You've figured something out already, haven't you?

148
00:09:12,324 --> 00:09:14,533
I do, but may I say it?

149
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:18,224
He doesn't seem like a bad person.

150
00:09:20,524 --> 00:09:23,224
I feel a bit sorry for him.

151
00:09:23,224 --> 00:09:25,924
Seriously. I guess I'll help him out, then.

152
00:09:27,724 --> 00:09:29,624
Granny.

153
00:09:29,624 --> 00:09:32,551
You were watching TV in that room, right?

154
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:34,553
Yes...

155
00:09:34,553 --> 00:09:38,824
Do you always stack that many books on the table like that?

156
00:09:38,824 --> 00:09:42,224
Right. I have this urge to look things up

157
00:09:42,224 --> 00:09:44,563
as soon as I come up with something that bothers me.

158
00:09:44,724 --> 00:09:47,024
Then, maybe the remote controller of the TV

159
00:09:47,024 --> 00:09:48,567
is buried somewhere underneath?

160
00:09:48,724 --> 00:09:52,571
Right, right. It's hard to pull it out from underneath.

161
00:09:56,824 --> 00:09:58,924
Goal!

162
00:09:58,924 --> 00:10:01,524
-Big Osaka's star player! -No way.

163
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:03,124
It turned on.

164
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:08,324
Since the TV remote controller was buried underneath the books,

165
00:10:08,324 --> 00:10:11,424
the channel button happened to be pressed down.

166
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:15,524
Therefore, it caused zapping.

167
00:10:15,524 --> 00:10:19,024
Isn't that right, Uncle Kogoro?

168
00:10:19,024 --> 00:10:22,601
Yeah, that... That's right.

169
00:10:22,824 --> 00:10:25,024
Thank you, Mr. Kogoro!

170
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,224
Thanks to you, the mystery's been solved.

171
00:10:27,224 --> 00:10:32,611
Well... I think it'd be better to tidy up the table.

172
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:35,624
If he's making her happy, maybe we should overlook his misdemeanor.

173
00:10:35,624 --> 00:10:38,617
I... I guess so.

174
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:40,324
Well...

175
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:44,623
It's not a big deal anyway.

176
00:10:47,524 --> 00:10:49,824
Hey, isn't he dead?

177
00:10:49,824 --> 00:10:51,824
Oh, no. Why?

178
00:10:51,824 --> 00:10:54,624
Ambulance! No, call the police!

179
00:10:54,624 --> 00:10:57,224
It... It seems like something happened next door.

180
00:10:57,224 --> 00:11:01,224
Next door? Do you mean my apartment?

181
00:11:01,224 --> 00:11:02,641
Conan?

182
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:03,624
Hey...

183
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:16,424
The door is busted!

184
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:21,824
This is...

185
00:11:26,665 --> 00:11:28,667
A room key?

186
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:32,424
Hey. Why is the door busted?

187
00:11:32,424 --> 00:11:35,624
-What is this, kid? -Never mind, just tell me.

188
00:11:35,624 --> 00:11:38,677
"Kumi Bannai (22)" -The bell of Mr. Denkawa's alarm clock

189
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:41,024
"Apartment Resident" -wouldn't stop ringing.

190
00:11:41,024 --> 00:11:42,681
"Ken Ishigame (64)" -So I came up to the door

191
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:45,124
"Apartment Resident" -and repeatedly asked him to stop the clock.

192
00:11:45,124 --> 00:11:46,685
"Junji Hyodo (28)" -Since there was no answer,

193
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:49,424
"Apartment Resident" -we had no choice but to bust the door open.

194
00:11:49,424 --> 00:11:52,691
Something similar happened last night, too.

195
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:54,693
Something similar?

196
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:57,624
He suddenly turned the TV on full blast.

197
00:11:57,624 --> 00:12:00,024
Moreover, it was zapping right through.

198
00:12:00,024 --> 00:12:02,324
Talk about a nuisance.

199
00:12:02,324 --> 00:12:04,703
Zapping?

200
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:06,024
When the three of us came and complained about it

201
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:07,224
in front of the door last night,

202
00:12:07,224 --> 00:12:09,124
it finally stopped.

203
00:12:09,124 --> 00:12:12,711
But the room key is near the corpse

204
00:12:12,924 --> 00:12:15,624
and he's holding a knife in his hand.

205
00:12:15,624 --> 00:12:19,224
I wonder if he cut his own neck and committed suicide.

206
00:12:19,224 --> 00:12:21,524
No, this is a homicide.

207
00:12:21,524 --> 00:12:23,324
Moreover, the killer is...

208
00:12:25,524 --> 00:12:28,024
among these three people here.

209
00:12:28,024 --> 00:12:31,124
Well, we should leave the rest to the police.

210
00:12:31,124 --> 00:12:35,324
No need to worry! The case will be solved immediately.

211
00:12:35,324 --> 00:12:36,424
The landlady?

212
00:12:36,424 --> 00:12:40,739
We've got the great Detective Kogoro Mouri on our side.

213
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:42,324
-What? -What?

214
00:12:44,524 --> 00:12:46,745
Hey...

215
00:12:53,996 --> 00:12:55,396
The victim is

216
00:12:55,396 --> 00:12:58,757
"Apartment Resident" -Mr. Gensuke Denkawa, 44 years old.

217
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:01,596
He had been living in this apartment since 10 years ago,

218
00:13:01,596 --> 00:13:03,696
and he was a construction worker.

219
00:13:03,696 --> 00:13:05,596
Am I correct?

220
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:06,765
Yes.

221
00:13:06,996 --> 00:13:08,767
It'd be better if you could've talked to my husband.

222
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:11,196
He would've been able to give you more information.

223
00:13:11,196 --> 00:13:14,396
But I've been in charge of maintaining this apartment

224
00:13:14,396 --> 00:13:15,796
since 10 years ago.

225
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,496
I formally took over as landlady

226
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:21,796
since last year after my husband passed away.

227
00:13:21,796 --> 00:13:24,196
By the way, is it true

228
00:13:24,196 --> 00:13:28,496
that Mr. Denkawa's alarm clock didn't stop ringing,

229
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:30,196
so the residents of this apartment,

230
00:13:30,196 --> 00:13:36,296
Ms. Bannai, Mr. Ishigame and Mr. Hyodo broke into this room?

231
00:13:36,296 --> 00:13:38,797
Yeah, we pounded on the door repeatedly

232
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:40,796
and told him to stop it, but...

233
00:13:40,796 --> 00:13:44,096
He wouldn't answer us at all, so we had no choice.

234
00:13:44,096 --> 00:13:47,496
And when we came inside, Mr. Denkawa was already...

235
00:13:47,496 --> 00:13:51,396
Then, this boy suddenly came into the room.

236
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:53,596
I was at the landlady's house

237
00:13:53,596 --> 00:13:56,596
and heard these people making a lot of noise through the window,

238
00:13:56,596 --> 00:13:58,096
so I decided to come.

239
00:13:58,096 --> 00:14:00,096
You saw them through the window?

240
00:14:00,096 --> 00:14:04,823
The landlady's house is right next door, you see.

241
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:08,827
But why were you at the landlady's house, Conan?

242
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:10,196
We're an acquaintance of the landlady,

243
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:12,496
and he was visiting her with me.

244
00:14:12,496 --> 00:14:13,496
What?

245
00:14:13,496 --> 00:14:17,396
Well, I can understand Ran and Conan being here but...

246
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:20,496
Who are you?

247
00:14:20,496 --> 00:14:23,796
Well, I...

248
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,596
You! You're a police detective

249
00:14:25,596 --> 00:14:28,196
but you don't know the great Detective Mouri?

250
00:14:28,196 --> 00:14:30,096
Of course, I know him, but...

251
00:14:30,096 --> 00:14:33,996
You go ahead and tell her since you're his daughter!

252
00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:36,196
Well...

253
00:14:36,196 --> 00:14:38,857
Thank you for always taking care of my dad!

254
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:42,596
Just what do you mean?

255
00:14:45,996 --> 00:14:47,896
I see.

256
00:14:47,896 --> 00:14:51,196
The landlady's granddaughter asked you to take care of her

257
00:14:51,196 --> 00:14:53,796
since she's living alone and feeling lonely.

258
00:14:53,796 --> 00:14:55,596
That young man with the fake mustache

259
00:14:55,596 --> 00:15:00,496
who's the granddaughter's boyfriend is pretending to be Mr. Mouri.

260
00:15:00,496 --> 00:15:01,996
Please!

261
00:15:01,996 --> 00:15:03,896
The landlady completely believes him.

262
00:15:03,896 --> 00:15:07,196
If she finds out that he's an imposter, she might feel depressed.

263
00:15:07,196 --> 00:15:09,596
Well, as long as he doesn't get in the way of the investigation,

264
00:15:09,596 --> 00:15:12,096
I could leave it at that.

265
00:15:12,096 --> 00:15:14,096
Thank you very much.

266
00:15:14,096 --> 00:15:17,496
If Inspector Megure finds out about it, he'll bawl us out.

267
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:19,996
So, back to the subject.

268
00:15:19,996 --> 00:15:22,896
Wasn't it taking things a bit too far to bust the door open

269
00:15:22,896 --> 00:15:26,696
just because the alarm clock didn't stop ringing?

270
00:15:26,696 --> 00:15:29,196
Don't you think so, Detective Mouri?

271
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:31,996
Well... Yeah.

272
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:33,696
I feel the same way!

273
00:15:33,696 --> 00:15:36,915
Denkawa had busted down my door too, you know.

274
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:40,696
He left a message saying that he pulled out the telephone line

275
00:15:40,696 --> 00:15:42,396
because my phone wouldn't stop ringing.

276
00:15:42,396 --> 00:15:45,996
In my case, he once taped my door with masking tape from the outside

277
00:15:45,996 --> 00:15:48,927
so that I couldn't get out of the room!

278
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:50,929
After finding out that Mr. Denkawa had done it,

279
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:52,931
I cornered him to tell me why he did it.

280
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:55,396
And he had the nerve to say it was because there was a foul odour.

281
00:15:55,396 --> 00:15:58,396
-A foul odour? -I was grilling salted fish,

282
00:15:58,396 --> 00:16:01,496
so it might have been a bit smelly.

283
00:16:01,496 --> 00:16:03,896
He also cracked my window.

284
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,796
It seems that Mr. Denkawa had a grudge against my grandson

285
00:16:05,796 --> 00:16:07,696
who cracked his window

286
00:16:07,696 --> 00:16:10,949
with a baseball when he came to see me.

287
00:16:11,196 --> 00:16:13,796
Did you report all the incidents to the landlady?

288
00:16:13,796 --> 00:16:16,496
Yeah, we reported it to the previous landlord.

289
00:16:16,496 --> 00:16:17,996
Everything was settled out of court

290
00:16:17,996 --> 00:16:19,796
since we thought we were partly to blame.

291
00:16:19,796 --> 00:16:23,896
After that, he started leading a quiet life.

292
00:16:23,896 --> 00:16:26,965
By the way, the volume of the TV last night was unreal.

293
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:29,396
Suddenly, he started watching TV with the volume at full blast.

294
00:16:29,396 --> 00:16:31,796
Furthermore, he was zapping the whole time.

295
00:16:31,796 --> 00:16:35,296
Since it was a nuisance to the neighbors, we knocked on the door

296
00:16:35,296 --> 00:16:37,796
and asked him to turn the volume down like we did today.

297
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:41,496
And? Did Mr. Denkawa listen to you?

298
00:16:41,496 --> 00:16:44,496
-Yes. -He did turn off the TV.

299
00:16:44,496 --> 00:16:46,296
He didn't say anything though.

300
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:49,696
But, why would Mr. Denkawa do something like that all of a sudden?

301
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:50,989
Beats me.

302
00:16:51,196 --> 00:16:53,696
Maybe he thought that we had gone out already.

303
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:57,296
The three of us were just about to leave.

304
00:16:57,296 --> 00:16:59,396
All three of you went out together?

305
00:16:59,396 --> 00:17:00,999
Yeah.

306
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:02,796
The parents of our friend live in Izu

307
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:04,496
and run a hot spring inn there.

308
00:17:04,496 --> 00:17:06,996
They offered to let us stay for cheap, so...

309
00:17:06,996 --> 00:17:10,196
The three of you get along well, don't you?

310
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:13,596
Well, we used to exchange a lot of stink talks about Denkawa.

311
00:17:13,596 --> 00:17:17,296
We were trying to figure out ways to chase him out of here.

312
00:17:17,296 --> 00:17:19,017
We went to talk it over at the inn.

313
00:17:19,196 --> 00:17:22,296
And when we came back just a while ago,

314
00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:24,696
the bell of the alarm clock was ringing.

315
00:17:24,696 --> 00:17:26,596
We went to put our things in the room,

316
00:17:26,596 --> 00:17:29,027
but the alarm didn't stop ringing even after a while.

317
00:17:29,196 --> 00:17:32,396
That's why we went to complain to him again!

318
00:17:32,396 --> 00:17:36,796
So, you busted the door down and found the corpse?

319
00:17:36,796 --> 00:17:39,696
What time did you leave for the hot spring last night?

320
00:17:39,696 --> 00:17:43,041
I think it was around 6 pm.

321
00:17:44,796 --> 00:17:47,696
By the way, where are the other residents of this apartment?

322
00:17:47,696 --> 00:17:49,396
We're the only ones living here.

323
00:17:49,396 --> 00:17:52,496
Because everyone else disliked Mr. Denkawa and left.

324
00:17:52,496 --> 00:17:55,053
In other words, after you three left,

325
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:58,396
there was nobody in the apartment except Mr. Denkawa.

326
00:17:58,396 --> 00:18:01,496
If I remember correctly, the time of death that the coroner estimated

327
00:18:01,496 --> 00:18:04,696
was between 5 pm to 7 pm last night.

328
00:18:04,696 --> 00:18:07,065
Yes. According to the testimony of the three,

329
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:10,396
it seems like Mr. Denkawa was still alive at 6 pm.

330
00:18:10,396 --> 00:18:13,096
The key to this room was near his body,

331
00:18:13,096 --> 00:18:15,396
and he was holding a blood-smeared knife in his hand.

332
00:18:15,396 --> 00:18:17,075
Judging from the circumstances,

333
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:20,096
he seems to have slashed his own throat with the knife

334
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:22,596
between 6 and 7 pm after the three left.

335
00:18:22,596 --> 00:18:25,083
Yes. Although we haven't found a suicide note yet,

336
00:18:25,296 --> 00:18:26,496
this seems to be none other than a suicide.

337
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:29,087
I don't think it was suicide.

338
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:29,896
What?

339
00:18:29,896 --> 00:18:33,396
I think this is the work of Death.

340
00:18:33,396 --> 00:18:36,096
Look. Although this key is located on the blood,

341
00:18:36,096 --> 00:18:38,896
there's no blood stain on it, right?

342
00:18:38,896 --> 00:18:40,196
True.

343
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:42,496
It's possible that when we came into the room,

344
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:45,596
someone accidentally kicked the key on the floor

345
00:18:45,596 --> 00:18:47,596
onto the pool of blood.

346
00:18:47,596 --> 00:18:50,496
But when I came into the room,

347
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:54,096
I touched the key a bit. And it was still a bit warm.

348
00:18:54,096 --> 00:18:55,396
What?

349
00:18:55,396 --> 00:19:00,696
I'm sure that Death killed this man and tried to take him away.

350
00:19:00,696 --> 00:19:04,896
But since those three busted the door and came in,

351
00:19:04,896 --> 00:19:08,096
he was surprised

352
00:19:08,096 --> 00:19:11,129
and dropped the key he was holding onto the dry blood.

353
00:19:12,096 --> 00:19:15,133
Huh? But that's strange.

354
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:18,096
I thought Death's hands were supposed to be cold.

355
00:19:18,096 --> 00:19:20,196
So how come the key was warm?

356
00:19:20,196 --> 00:19:24,596
That's probably because somebody hid the key in his or her hand,

357
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:27,996
and threw it near the corpse after entering this room

358
00:19:27,996 --> 00:19:31,496
to make it seem like the door was locked.

359
00:19:31,496 --> 00:19:33,696
It's one of the three of you

360
00:19:33,696 --> 00:19:35,996
who busted down the door and came in.

361
00:19:35,996 --> 00:19:37,155
What?

362
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:39,157
I wonder if the culprit thought that if he locked the door

363
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:41,796
and left the place after killing Mr. Denkawa,

364
00:19:41,796 --> 00:19:45,643
that it would be a perfect alibi?

365
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,462
Wait a second!

366
00:19:47,462 --> 00:19:50,562
Then, what about the loud sound of the TV

367
00:19:50,562 --> 00:19:53,171
that was playing before we left?

368
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:56,962
We've already confirmed that the sound came from Mr. Denkawa's room.

369
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:59,862
Maybe the sound of the TV was recorded beforehand

370
00:19:59,862 --> 00:20:01,462
and set to play with a timer.

371
00:20:01,462 --> 00:20:04,762
But the first thing we heard was the 6 pm news,

372
00:20:04,762 --> 00:20:06,962
The date, the day as well as the news that were aired

373
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:08,562
were all from yesterday.

374
00:20:08,562 --> 00:20:11,189
The channels were switched after two to three minutes though.

375
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:15,562
Then, maybe a TV or DVD recorder was used.

376
00:20:15,562 --> 00:20:18,362
Nowadays, you can reserve the program you want to watch

377
00:20:18,362 --> 00:20:20,762
and the TV will turn on by itself.

378
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,662
If several devices are used,

379
00:20:22,662 --> 00:20:24,762
it could sound like it's zapping, too.

380
00:20:24,762 --> 00:20:28,262
I don't think that's possible.

381
00:20:28,262 --> 00:20:32,162
There's only one TV in this room.

382
00:20:33,562 --> 00:20:36,262
There doesn't seem to be anything that looks like a timer here either.

383
00:20:36,262 --> 00:20:40,062
The only things here are the alarm clock beside the bed

384
00:20:40,062 --> 00:20:42,262
and the two electric fans.

385
00:20:42,262 --> 00:20:45,223
One of the fans was knocked over though.

386
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:47,862
I was the one who knocked it over.

387
00:20:47,862 --> 00:20:52,062
At any rate, I wanted to stop the bell of the alarm clock right away.

388
00:20:52,062 --> 00:20:54,162
I came into the room when it was dim.

389
00:20:54,162 --> 00:20:57,235
As for me, I tripped over the corpse's feet

390
00:20:57,235 --> 00:20:59,237
and scraped my elbow.

391
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:03,241
I pulled the string of the light and turned the light on,

392
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:05,243
and found the room in this condition.

393
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:09,247
Anyway, do you need two fans in a room?

394
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,862
Some people do that.

395
00:21:10,862 --> 00:21:11,962
One is for cooling themselves,

396
00:21:11,962 --> 00:21:14,362
and the other is for ventilating the room.

397
00:21:14,362 --> 00:21:16,562
Kamen Yaiba!

398
00:21:16,562 --> 00:21:18,462
The sound is so loud!

399
00:21:22,762 --> 00:21:25,263
This TV has the function of recording programs,

400
00:21:25,462 --> 00:21:28,262
but I don't think that zapping is possible.

401
00:21:28,262 --> 00:21:30,062
But this is strange.

402
00:21:30,062 --> 00:21:32,362
The room looks quite tidy and yet

403
00:21:32,362 --> 00:21:35,662
the laundry seems to have been taken in and left as is.

404
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:39,277
Even the clothes pins are scattered on the floor.

405
00:21:39,462 --> 00:21:41,562
The newspaper leaflets left on the mattress

406
00:21:41,562 --> 00:21:43,281
also seem out of place.

407
00:21:43,281 --> 00:21:45,762
Besides that, there's only one TV set,

408
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:48,762
so why are there two remote controllers?

409
00:21:48,762 --> 00:21:51,062
This one is a universal remote controller.

410
00:21:51,062 --> 00:21:53,762
Did he buy a universal remote controller

411
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:57,062
because he lost the remote controller and found it later on?

412
00:21:58,762 --> 00:22:01,299
There are splattered blood spots on the side of the remote controller.

413
00:22:01,462 --> 00:22:03,862
Moreover, it's slightly scraped.

414
00:22:11,462 --> 00:22:13,762
Don't tell me this is...

415
00:22:15,313 --> 00:22:19,317
The culprit is one of the three who found the corpse after all.

416
00:22:27,562 --> 00:22:29,962
The culprit may have schemed a perfect crime

417
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:32,462
and made it look as if Mr. Denkawa committed suicide,

418
00:22:32,462 --> 00:22:34,462
but he can't fool me.

419
00:22:34,462 --> 00:22:39,662
Whoever it is, I'll disclose the culprit for sure!

420
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:03,820
Next Conan's Hint:

421
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,702
"Clothes Pin"

422
00:24:05,702 --> 00:24:08,740
Even Mr. Mouri's imposter can solve cases.

423
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,560
True. Wait, do you mean me?
