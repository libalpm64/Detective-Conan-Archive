1
00:00:02,568 --> 00:00:04,368
The light of summer is the glory of yesterday.

2
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:06,468
After the tears, comes the knife of the mountain crone.

3
00:00:06,468 --> 00:00:08,168
The members of the Youth Detective Squad get lost.

4
00:00:08,168 --> 00:00:09,468
In the mountains where a mountain crone is said to live.

5
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:11,068
Something's bound to happen tonight!

6
00:00:11,068 --> 00:00:12,568
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,568 --> 00:00:14,168
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,168 --> 00:00:16,468
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:12,801
"Road Closed"

10
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:14,101
It's a dead end.

11
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:17,101
What? Not again...

12
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:19,201
The 17th time.

13
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:22,101
The roads around here are really difficult to make out.

14
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:26,601
There are many forked and dead end roads that aren't on the map...

15
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:28,901
I told you not to, didn't I?

16
00:02:28,901 --> 00:02:30,201
When you said that you wanted to avoid traffic

17
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:33,101
and take a side road, Doc.

18
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:34,501
Traffic jams and heat

19
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:37,701
are the two worst conditions for aircooling engines.

20
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:40,901
Besides, I figured that even if we did get lost

21
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:43,301
using the navigation system of the cell phone would suffice.

22
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:44,501
You're saying that you didn't think

23
00:02:44,501 --> 00:02:47,301
this area would be out of range?

24
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:50,001
Why don't you have a navigator equipped in your car?

25
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:51,501
If you had a navigator in your car,

26
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:54,101
it would tell us where to go and all.

27
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:56,301
I'm hungry.

28
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,301
My navigator is still in the developmental stage.

29
00:02:59,301 --> 00:03:01,901
Once it's completed, it'll really be something.

30
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:05,201
It'll be one of the best around, full of functions.

31
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:07,201
If it's ever completed.

32
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:10,801
Either way, let's go back.

33
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:12,001
If we keep on going,

34
00:03:12,001 --> 00:03:14,701
we may be able to get out of the out of service range

35
00:03:14,701 --> 00:03:17,201
and meet cars or people on the way too.

36
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:19,501
Okay.

37
00:03:19,501 --> 00:03:22,201
It's so hard to figure these places out.

38
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:30,701
Shoots, it's completely flat.

39
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:33,001
You didn't bring the spare tire, did you?

40
00:03:33,001 --> 00:03:36,401
I just changed all the tires to new ones,

41
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:38,601
so I didn't think I'd end up with a flat.

42
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:41,401
More than that, I had to leave the spare tire behind

43
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:44,201
in order to load all the bags.

44
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:46,501
The sun's gone down and it's dark.

45
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:49,101
We don't even know where we are.

46
00:03:49,101 --> 00:03:51,201
I guess we've got no choice but to sleep out here.

47
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:52,501
What...

48
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:54,401
What do you mean what?

49
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,901
We were planning to camp to begin with anyway.

50
00:03:56,901 --> 00:03:58,901
We've got everything we need to camp outside.

51
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:04,501
But, isn't this mountain? Kind of creepy.

52
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:07,601
Like a ghost appearing, right?

53
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:10,601
Oh, yeah... the kind that comes out in the folklores of Japan.

54
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:14,101
Like cannibal witches and mountain crones...

55
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:15,101
Mountain crones...

56
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:16,401
Hey, come off it...

57
00:04:16,401 --> 00:04:19,301
There are no such things in real life.

58
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:23,301
Huh? But, a house that fits the image is in view over there.

59
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,601
Hey, don't tell me that it's...

60
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:32,801
The house of a mountain crone.

61
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:34,001
No joke!

62
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:36,501
Oh, come on, no way.

63
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:39,501
That's right. It looks pretty big too,

64
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:42,301
so let's go ask if they'll let us spend the night there.

65
00:04:42,301 --> 00:04:45,001
Huh...

66
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:47,001
At that house...

67
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:48,601
But, it's strange.

68
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:49,901
Since no other light is in view elsewhere,

69
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:52,801
that house is the only one around here.

70
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:54,901
To think that there's only one big house like that

71
00:04:54,901 --> 00:04:57,401
deep in the mountains like this...

72
00:04:57,401 --> 00:04:59,601
True.

73
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:03,001
It's just as if the house is beckoning us to come.

74
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:04,701
Telling us to come over...

75
00:05:04,701 --> 00:05:06,101
What...

76
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:08,501
At any rate, we've got to decide

77
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:10,001
whether we want to spend the night out here

78
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:12,201
or ask whether we'll be able to spend the night over at the house.

79
00:05:12,201 --> 00:05:13,301
What shall we do?

80
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:14,801
I'm scared.

81
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:18,201
But to sleep out here is dangerous too.

82
00:05:20,301 --> 00:05:22,601
Let's go! To the mountain crone's house!

83
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:24,201
Huh?

84
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:25,901
Haibara and Ayumi!

85
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:28,401
I'll protect both of you with my life!

86
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:30,601
Thank you.

87
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:33,601
I guess you're going to give yourself if she decides to eat me then?

88
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,601
I don't think so.

89
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:39,101
Besides, I think the mountain crone would prefer Genta than me

90
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:41,201
for he has more fat on him and looks more delicious.

91
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:44,601
You'll make good soup stock yourself.

92
00:05:44,601 --> 00:05:45,601
Really stupid.

93
00:05:45,601 --> 00:05:47,201
So everyone!

94
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:50,301
Each of you hold your own bags, all right?

95
00:05:50,301 --> 00:05:51,801
Okay...

96
00:05:53,101 --> 00:05:58,901
"The Sword of The Mountain Crone Part One"

97
00:06:00,701 --> 00:06:05,001
Well, the house sure has a fine thatched roof.

98
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:07,901
It doesn't seem to be the house of a mountain crone, does it?

99
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,301
-Let's go. -See.

100
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:13,201
They say that mountain crones usually live in small shabby huts.

101
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:16,501
Yes, right, and they're always holding kitchen knives, right?

102
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,501
Yeah, a really big knife, right?

103
00:06:21,601 --> 00:06:23,701
Well, is it...

104
00:06:23,701 --> 00:06:26,401
this kind of knife?

105
00:06:26,401 --> 00:06:27,901
There she is...

106
00:06:27,901 --> 00:06:29,101
A mountain crone!

107
00:06:30,401 --> 00:06:32,401
Do you live here, granny?

108
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:34,101
Yeah, I do. Who are you people?

109
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:36,701
Could you put us up for the night?

110
00:06:36,701 --> 00:06:38,901
Our car tire went flat.

111
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:41,101
A flat? In a place like this?

112
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:44,301
We're sorry to have to ask you something like this out of the blue,

113
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:48,201
but we got lost on the way to the camping site.

114
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:51,901
We were at a loss what to do, when your house came into view.

115
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:54,801
Is that so? You should have said so earlier?

116
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:57,101
What's with that knife of yours?

117
00:06:57,101 --> 00:07:00,701
I was cutting pickled vegetables in that hut

118
00:07:00,701 --> 00:07:03,101
when I heard your voices.

119
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:06,301
So, I came out to see who would come to a place like this.

120
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,601
Then, I heard you talking of a mountain crone.

121
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:12,501
There are no other lights in view elsewhere

122
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:15,001
except for your house, granny.

123
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,301
This is the only house in this area.

124
00:07:18,301 --> 00:07:20,901
All those who used to live here

125
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:23,601
have left for town already.

126
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:26,201
Well, I can't give you a decent welcome,

127
00:07:26,201 --> 00:07:28,901
but if that's okay with you, come on inside.

128
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:30,401
Thank you very much.

129
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:36,601
Huh?

130
00:07:36,601 --> 00:07:40,201
Is there somebody else living here with you?

131
00:07:40,201 --> 00:07:42,601
No. I live here alone.

132
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:46,001
But, there is another pair of slippers out.

133
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:48,601
"Tanaka Iwae, age 74" -Those slippers are my grandson Shota's.

134
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:52,701
He left ten years ago saying that he wants to become a cook.

135
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:57,301
It's just been left as is, since he left.

136
00:07:57,301 --> 00:07:59,701
You can go ahead and use them if you want.

137
00:07:59,701 --> 00:08:03,501
There are a lot of slippers in this shoe cabinet too.

138
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:06,701
Oh, no, I didn't mean to make it sound that way...

139
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:09,401
-Huh? -Here you go, Ayumi and Haibara.

140
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:10,801
There's a pair for you too, Conan.

141
00:08:10,801 --> 00:08:12,101
Thanks.

142
00:08:12,101 --> 00:08:13,501
Huh?

143
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:15,601
I wonder who this person is?

144
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:16,601
I wonder...

145
00:08:16,601 --> 00:08:18,501
That's Shota.

146
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:21,401
He's a heartless character that never once came to visit

147
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:24,701
nor sent any letters after leaving here ten years ago.

148
00:08:24,701 --> 00:08:27,801
He seems to have become a skilled chef now

149
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:31,101
and sends me a lot of money every month.

150
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:34,001
But I haven't touched

151
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:36,401
a cent of that heartless guy's money.

152
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:39,601
Oh, goldfish!

153
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:41,401
It's my grandson's goldfish too.

154
00:08:41,401 --> 00:08:44,501
The nerve of him to leave something so bothersome behind.

155
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:47,501
The goldfish is pretty big, isn't it?

156
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:50,401
It's been alive for more than ten years already, you see.

157
00:08:50,401 --> 00:08:52,101
Are you going to make it fat, then eat it?

158
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:54,001
Genta, what's with you, all stuck on eating stuff?

159
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:56,101
You're no different from a mountain crone.

160
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:57,701
Right, Conan?

161
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:02,301
What's the matter, Tsuburaya?

162
00:09:02,301 --> 00:09:04,301
Just now, someone was looking this way

163
00:09:04,301 --> 00:09:05,601
from the gap in that door!

164
00:09:05,601 --> 00:09:06,901
What?

165
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:10,501
Huh? Now, who would come to a place like this?

166
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:12,101
Hey, Conan!

167
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:15,801
Who are you?

168
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:17,501
What are you doing there?

169
00:09:20,301 --> 00:09:22,501
Boy, do you live here?

170
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:25,501
Yes, they are...

171
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:27,601
Would you go call the person then?

172
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,701
What do you want?

173
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:32,001
We hate to trouble you.

174
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:33,201
"Akane Ouba, age 25" -We came to this mountains

175
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:36,401
to go on a forest retreat.

176
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:38,501
"Raito Adachi, age 29" -But, we got lost

177
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:40,401
and on top of that we ran out of gas.

178
00:09:40,401 --> 00:09:41,701
"Fuga Kahara, age 28" -If it's okay with you,

179
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:44,601
could you let us spend the night here just tonight?

180
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:50,601
We're not bad people or anything like that.

181
00:09:50,601 --> 00:09:52,501
I'm Fuga Kahara.

182
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:55,001
I'm Akane Ouba.

183
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:57,201
I'm Raito Adachi.

184
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:59,701
I work in the service industry in Tokyo.

185
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,301
And I'm his customer.

186
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:06,601
Please do let us stay for just one night, please?

187
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:09,901
I'll let you stay tonight.

188
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,401
Thanks.

189
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:15,501
However, don't you ever come back here again.

190
00:10:15,501 --> 00:10:17,101
What a snob.

191
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:19,301
She seems to be in a bad mood.

192
00:10:19,301 --> 00:10:20,301
I tell you...

193
00:10:20,301 --> 00:10:23,701
I wouldn't spend the night here, if she begged me to.

194
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:26,001
-Come on... -Don't just stand there, you guys.

195
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,301
But sit down where you can!

196
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:28,801
Yes, madam.

197
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:31,401
Don't irk her any further. We really can't afford that to happen.

198
00:10:31,401 --> 00:10:34,701
I tell you, it's all because you got lost, Fuga.

199
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:37,201
I'm so sorry, my lady.

200
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:39,401
Well, let's go inside.

201
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:42,501
Host?

202
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:44,901
Both of you are hosts?

203
00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:48,501
Yeah. I'm Number two at the shop,

204
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:50,901
while Raito is Number One.

205
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:55,201
Thanks to our lady here who patronizes us.

206
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:57,201
Look...

207
00:10:57,201 --> 00:10:58,501
Goldfish...

208
00:10:58,501 --> 00:10:59,901
Don't you think they're really cute?

209
00:10:59,901 --> 00:11:01,801
There're quite a lot of them.

210
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:03,301
Oh, it's a Tamasaba!

211
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:04,301
Tamasaba?

212
00:11:04,301 --> 00:11:06,001
See, this one!

213
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:09,901
It has a body like goldfish, but the tail of a mackerel.

214
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:11,601
Out of all the 12,

215
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:14,301
this one's a goldfish you don't get to see very often.

216
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:16,801
Fuga, you're knowledgeable!

217
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,501
I used to have them before, that's why...

218
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:20,301
You erudite king.

219
00:11:20,301 --> 00:11:22,201
I know about stones, you know.

220
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:24,801
The transparent one at the right end is a quartz

221
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:27,601
and the one beside it, the mottled one is isinglass.

222
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:30,801
The one on the front left, that shiny black one

223
00:11:30,801 --> 00:11:33,701
is an obsidian that was used in the Jomon Period.

224
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:35,301
Amazing...

225
00:11:35,301 --> 00:11:37,001
You're both super geniuses!

226
00:11:37,001 --> 00:11:38,001
I think it's call knowledgeable

227
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:40,901
and not genius in this case.

228
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,401
She's got it all thought out.

229
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:45,901
She acts dumb like that and makes men feel good,

230
00:11:45,901 --> 00:11:48,401
and as a result she gets pampered.

231
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:50,601
She's the type that drives men down the drain.

232
00:11:50,601 --> 00:11:52,501
What? Are you serious?

233
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:54,101
Yes, I'm serious, dead serious.

234
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:56,301
Excuse me.

235
00:11:56,301 --> 00:11:57,501
If it's okay with you,

236
00:11:57,501 --> 00:11:59,901
would it be all right to use your kitchen?

237
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:01,901
The kitchen?

238
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:04,201
Well, since I was planning to cook curry with the children

239
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:06,101
at the camp site,

240
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:09,001
I brought the ingredients to make it along.

241
00:12:09,001 --> 00:12:10,801
I'm hungry.

242
00:12:10,801 --> 00:12:12,401
Since it's easy to make,

243
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:15,501
I thought I'd make it for them.

244
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,401
Men shouldn't stand in the kitchen!

245
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:19,801
Huh?

246
00:12:19,801 --> 00:12:21,001
If you've got the ingredients,

247
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:23,201
I'll make the curry for you.

248
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,101
Thank you.

249
00:12:25,101 --> 00:12:27,101
I'll help you!

250
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:29,601
Kids shouldn't worry about things like that.

251
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:30,801
Just stay put.

252
00:12:30,801 --> 00:12:32,301
Okay.

253
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:35,301
I never cooked before.

254
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:38,301
Fine. I can make curry without anyone's help.

255
00:12:38,301 --> 00:12:41,501
I used to make it a lot for my grandson before.

256
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:42,901
Where are the ingredients?

257
00:12:42,901 --> 00:12:45,401
In that bag over there.

258
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:47,601
What a big bag.

259
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:51,001
I was wondering what he'd brought along also.

260
00:12:56,305 --> 00:12:59,705
Granny's curry was good.

261
00:12:59,705 --> 00:13:02,805
As long as you get to eat, anything's delicious right, Genta?

262
00:13:02,805 --> 00:13:04,305
It sure was good, though.

263
00:13:04,305 --> 00:13:05,905
Yes.

264
00:13:05,905 --> 00:13:07,905
The children use the room to the right

265
00:13:07,905 --> 00:13:10,105
at the end of the hall.

266
00:13:10,105 --> 00:13:12,105
Okay...

267
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:13,705
Thank you very much.

268
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:17,705
And you men use the room at the end of the hall to the left.

269
00:13:17,705 --> 00:13:19,405
You use this room!

270
00:13:19,405 --> 00:13:20,405
What?

271
00:13:20,405 --> 00:13:22,705
I want to stay in the same room as the two of them.

272
00:13:22,705 --> 00:13:24,505
Men and women should not share the same room

273
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:25,905
after the age of seven!

274
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,405
Huh? Just what kind of a spell is that?

275
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:31,105
What a thing for a young unmarried woman to say!

276
00:13:31,105 --> 00:13:33,105
What loose conduct!

277
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:35,105
What does loose conduct mean?

278
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,705
We're seven years old,

279
00:13:36,705 --> 00:13:38,405
but is it alright for us to be in the same room?

280
00:13:38,405 --> 00:13:40,105
I'm not married either.

281
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,005
Huh?

282
00:14:18,005 --> 00:14:19,605
What's this sound?

283
00:14:27,205 --> 00:14:29,305
The sound's coming from here.

284
00:14:29,305 --> 00:14:32,005
I'm sure that this was the kitchen.

285
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:40,505
Huh?

286
00:14:46,105 --> 00:14:48,505
What's the matter, Mitsuhiko?

287
00:14:48,505 --> 00:14:51,105
It still before 4am.

288
00:14:51,105 --> 00:14:53,205
Please run away.

289
00:14:53,205 --> 00:14:54,205
Huh?

290
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:56,605
Hurry... get out of here.

291
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:59,205
Or else, we'll be killed.

292
00:15:02,005 --> 00:15:03,505
The voice just now...

293
00:15:03,505 --> 00:15:05,305
It... it's that lady, right?

294
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,905
It came from outside.

295
00:15:12,905 --> 00:15:15,905
Hey, my lady...

296
00:15:15,905 --> 00:15:17,605
What's the matter, Akane?

297
00:15:17,605 --> 00:15:19,205
-Akane! -What's the matter?

298
00:15:19,205 --> 00:15:20,205
What's up?

299
00:15:21,205 --> 00:15:23,505
Akane...

300
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,505
Call the ambulance and the police.

301
00:15:25,505 --> 00:15:28,505
-Okay, I got it. -Quick!

302
00:15:28,505 --> 00:15:31,105
Akane. Raito.

303
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:33,605
-Fuga? -Let's take her inside.

304
00:15:33,605 --> 00:15:35,605
Oh... okay.

305
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,705
It's no use.

306
00:15:41,705 --> 00:15:44,905
Her artery's been stabbed with a sharp weapon,

307
00:15:44,905 --> 00:15:46,305
and there's too much bleeding.

308
00:15:46,305 --> 00:15:47,605
It's too late already.

309
00:15:47,605 --> 00:15:49,105
Hey, kid,

310
00:15:49,105 --> 00:15:50,205
don't say something you're not sure of...

311
00:15:50,205 --> 00:15:51,305
Fuga.

312
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:56,305
I can't believe it.

313
00:16:04,105 --> 00:16:05,505
A sharp weapon?

314
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:09,805
Normally a dagger or a kitchen knife.

315
00:16:09,805 --> 00:16:13,805
The problem is... who would want to kill her at this hour of the day,

316
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:15,905
and with what kind of sharp weapon.

317
00:16:15,905 --> 00:16:17,505
Moreover, in a remote mountains like this.

318
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:20,005
A knife in the remote mountains.

319
00:16:20,005 --> 00:16:21,105
Don't tell me that...

320
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,505
Mountain crone...

321
00:16:23,505 --> 00:16:25,105
The police as well as the ambulance

322
00:16:25,105 --> 00:16:27,105
should be here in an hour or so.

323
00:16:28,205 --> 00:16:29,205
Hey...

324
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:31,505
What's the matter, Mitsuhiko?

325
00:16:31,505 --> 00:16:33,005
Nothing...

326
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:34,405
I hope you're not thinking

327
00:16:34,405 --> 00:16:37,705
that I'm the mountain crone.

328
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,405
Oh, granny.

329
00:16:39,405 --> 00:16:41,705
Would you lend me your bathroom?

330
00:16:41,705 --> 00:16:43,605
Yeah, go ahead.

331
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:46,105
I really want to wash the blood off.

332
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,105
That...

333
00:16:47,105 --> 00:16:50,205
Oh, go out the sliding paper door, turn right at the stairs

334
00:16:50,205 --> 00:16:52,805
and go all the way to the end of the hall to go to the bathroom.

335
00:16:52,805 --> 00:16:55,205
See, just beyond the kitchen.

336
00:16:55,205 --> 00:16:57,305
Kitchen...

337
00:17:00,605 --> 00:17:03,305
So putting your story together.

338
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:07,105
This morning at about 3.58am, you went out

339
00:17:07,105 --> 00:17:10,205
because you suddenly heard a scream from outside the house

340
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:13,805
and found this woman with her neck slashed, is that right?

341
00:17:13,805 --> 00:17:15,505
Yes.

342
00:17:15,505 --> 00:17:20,705
The name of the victim is Ms. Akane Ouba, age 25.

343
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:23,205
She's the daughter of the president of a financial company?

344
00:17:23,205 --> 00:17:25,805
Yes, that's right.

345
00:17:25,805 --> 00:17:28,105
And according to what I hear...

346
00:17:28,105 --> 00:17:30,605
When you all got here,

347
00:17:30,605 --> 00:17:34,305
there was another person who was already right beside her.

348
00:17:34,305 --> 00:17:35,605
Oh, that's me.

349
00:17:35,605 --> 00:17:37,705
Huh? Are you the one who killed her?

350
00:17:37,705 --> 00:17:39,305
Oh, no.

351
00:17:39,305 --> 00:17:42,605
I was on the first floor to go to the restroom

352
00:17:42,605 --> 00:17:44,105
when I heard her scream.

353
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:48,405
That's why I got to her before everyone else did.

354
00:17:48,405 --> 00:17:49,805
And when you got to her,

355
00:17:49,805 --> 00:17:52,205
did you see any suspicious person around?

356
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:53,905
No, not that I recall.

357
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:56,005
It was sort of dark yet besides,

358
00:17:56,005 --> 00:17:58,205
and above all, I was more concerned about her lying on the ground.

359
00:18:00,505 --> 00:18:02,105
By the way, what's your name?

360
00:18:02,105 --> 00:18:05,805
Huh... Raito Adachi.

361
00:18:05,805 --> 00:18:08,205
Mr. Raito Adachi.

362
00:18:08,205 --> 00:18:09,805
And, you?

363
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:11,305
Fuga Kahara.

364
00:18:11,305 --> 00:18:13,905
Mr. Fuga Kahara.

365
00:18:13,905 --> 00:18:17,305
Huh? This house is the Yamada residence, isn't it?

366
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:18,805
It's Tanaka!

367
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:20,705
This is the Tanaka residence.

368
00:18:20,705 --> 00:18:24,405
I'm Iwae Tanaka, the one who called you.

369
00:18:24,405 --> 00:18:25,905
Oh, I'm sorry.

370
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,305
Right...

371
00:18:27,305 --> 00:18:28,405
I've got your name down

372
00:18:28,405 --> 00:18:31,805
as the one who reported the incident, right here.

373
00:18:31,805 --> 00:18:34,005
Is he really all right?

374
00:18:34,005 --> 00:18:38,505
I'm just wondering why a Mr. Adachi and Mr. Kahara

375
00:18:38,505 --> 00:18:40,705
is at the Tanaka residence?

376
00:18:40,705 --> 00:18:45,305
Also, how is everyone connected with the woman victim?

377
00:18:45,305 --> 00:18:48,905
She's a customer of the shop where Fuga and I work at.

378
00:18:48,905 --> 00:18:52,805
We're hosts who brought Akane

379
00:18:52,805 --> 00:18:54,505
who said she wanted to forest bathe

380
00:18:54,505 --> 00:18:56,205
to the mountains here by car.

381
00:18:56,205 --> 00:18:57,505
You're hosts?

382
00:18:57,505 --> 00:19:00,305
Yes, he got lost yesterday

383
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,705
and the car ran out of gas.

384
00:19:02,705 --> 00:19:05,405
So, we spent the night here last night

385
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:07,805
at Mrs. Tanaka's house.

386
00:19:07,805 --> 00:19:11,705
Where are the members of your family Mrs. Tanaka?

387
00:19:11,705 --> 00:19:13,705
They're not here.

388
00:19:13,705 --> 00:19:16,805
Ten years ago after my grandson left,

389
00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:19,305
I've been living here alone.

390
00:19:20,905 --> 00:19:23,205
And you folks just happened to be here...

391
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,405
Just like those men there.

392
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:28,405
We got lost on the way to the camping site,

393
00:19:28,405 --> 00:19:30,605
and on top of that, we ended up with a flat tire.

394
00:19:30,605 --> 00:19:33,105
We asked granny to put us up for the night.

395
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:36,005
A little before they did.

396
00:19:36,005 --> 00:19:37,805
Then it's the same as usual,

397
00:19:37,805 --> 00:19:40,405
you've found yourself involved in a case?

398
00:19:40,405 --> 00:19:42,505
Well, I guess so.

399
00:19:43,505 --> 00:19:46,205
Ran out of gas and a flat tire.

400
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:52,205
Let's see, Conan, was it?

401
00:19:52,205 --> 00:19:53,305
I'll be honest with you,

402
00:19:53,305 --> 00:19:55,305
but I'm sure that you should go and have yourself blessed.

403
00:19:55,305 --> 00:19:58,305
I just know that you're possessed by something that's not too good.

404
00:19:58,305 --> 00:20:01,905
Do you have any idea who the culprit may be?

405
00:20:01,905 --> 00:20:04,005
Well, not really.

406
00:20:04,005 --> 00:20:06,705
Although it was raining at the time of the murder,

407
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,305
there are no footprints around the house,

408
00:20:08,305 --> 00:20:10,005
except for the front entrance area,

409
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:12,005
and no murder weapon has been found either.

410
00:20:12,005 --> 00:20:15,905
On top of that, no suspicious person has been witnessed.

411
00:20:15,905 --> 00:20:18,205
In other words, the killer, as well as the murder weapon

412
00:20:18,205 --> 00:20:21,705
are probably in this house.

413
00:20:21,705 --> 00:20:22,805
Huh?

414
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:25,605
Hey...

415
00:20:25,605 --> 00:20:28,605
Don't tell me that you're suspecting us?

416
00:20:28,605 --> 00:20:29,705
It can't be helped.

417
00:20:29,705 --> 00:20:30,805
Huh?

418
00:20:30,805 --> 00:20:33,905
Because we're the ones who brought her here.

419
00:20:33,905 --> 00:20:35,605
-But... -Of course,

420
00:20:35,605 --> 00:20:38,605
it's not that I suspect just you two.

421
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:41,005
I will have to interrogate everyone here.

422
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:43,905
One by one, about the incident.

423
00:20:43,905 --> 00:20:46,405
Let me start with the one who first found her, Mr. Raito Adachi?

424
00:20:46,405 --> 00:20:48,805
Yeah. That's the name that I use at the shop and...

425
00:20:48,805 --> 00:20:50,605
You gotta be kidding!

426
00:20:50,605 --> 00:20:51,905
Interrogation without any proof,

427
00:20:51,905 --> 00:20:54,005
and you're treating us like we're the killer?

428
00:20:54,005 --> 00:20:58,005
It's not that I'm treating you like the killer.

429
00:20:58,005 --> 00:20:59,805
Hey... Fuga.

430
00:20:59,805 --> 00:21:02,805
I'm not going to say a word unless you come up

431
00:21:02,805 --> 00:21:05,705
with some evidence or the murder weapon!

432
00:21:05,705 --> 00:21:08,705
That's fine but taking that kind of an attitude,

433
00:21:08,705 --> 00:21:11,305
will give you a bad impression.

434
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:18,205
A saw, a knife, chopper and two kitchen knives.

435
00:21:18,205 --> 00:21:20,105
Dr. Agasa...

436
00:21:20,105 --> 00:21:21,605
Why do you have so many things

437
00:21:21,605 --> 00:21:23,805
that could be potential weapons?

438
00:21:23,805 --> 00:21:28,005
Most naturally because we came here to camp.

439
00:21:28,005 --> 00:21:29,505
You two...

440
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:32,305
really have nothing on you?

441
00:21:32,305 --> 00:21:35,705
No, you already checked our body a while ago too, didn't you?

442
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,005
And in this house there are...

443
00:21:39,005 --> 00:21:42,805
three kitchen knives, a hoe, a sickle,

444
00:21:42,805 --> 00:21:44,905
an ax and a scissors.

445
00:21:44,905 --> 00:21:46,705
Is this really everything?

446
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,405
The only other thing left

447
00:21:48,405 --> 00:21:50,905
is my grandson's tool box in the shed.

448
00:21:50,905 --> 00:21:53,605
I'm sure it's already rusty though.

449
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:54,905
That... that's a lie!

450
00:21:54,905 --> 00:21:57,405
Huh? What did you just say?

451
00:21:57,405 --> 00:21:59,905
I... I saw her this morning.

452
00:21:59,905 --> 00:22:02,305
I noticed a strange sound when going back

453
00:22:02,305 --> 00:22:04,605
to my room from the restroom.

454
00:22:08,505 --> 00:22:10,905
I heard the sound coming from the kitchen,

455
00:22:10,905 --> 00:22:12,005
so I took a peek...

456
00:22:14,105 --> 00:22:16,905
And saw granny...

457
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:22,105
here...

458
00:22:22,105 --> 00:22:24,105
sharpening a knife!

459
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:26,205
Her hair was dishevelled!

460
00:22:26,205 --> 00:22:28,905
It was a kitchen knife with a bright red handle!

461
00:22:28,905 --> 00:22:30,705
She looked like an ogre!

462
00:24:46,805 --> 00:24:49,005
Next Conan's Hint:

463
00:24:49,005 --> 00:24:50,905
Goldfish Aquarium.

464
00:24:50,905 --> 00:24:52,105
We encounter an incident involving a mountain crone in the mountains.

465
00:24:52,105 --> 00:24:53,105
Officer Yamamura appears and the case reaches a climax,

466
00:24:53,105 --> 00:24:54,105
just a step to being solved!

467
00:24:54,105 --> 00:24:55,905
This story is certainly full of mountain, heights and climax.
