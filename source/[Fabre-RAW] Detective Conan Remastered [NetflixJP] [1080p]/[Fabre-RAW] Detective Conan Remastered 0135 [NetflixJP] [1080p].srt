1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,680
Alibis, secret codes, tricks, deals.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,880
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,680
Today's scene of the crime is a condominium.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,780
City crows are happy on trash collection day.

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,180
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,280
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,680
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,990
"Investigation Case Of The Missing Murder Weapon"

9
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,190
Isn't there any interesting cases happening?

10
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,490
That past one about the stadium was great, wasn't it?

11
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,390
Yeah, wish something like that would happen again.

12
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:15,090
It'd be a disaster if a case like that happened all the time.

13
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,390
Hey, hey.

14
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,090
I always come to this beauty shop with Mother.

15
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,890
Midori Beauty Salon?

16
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,290
The manager's name is "Midori".

17
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,890
And, there's a beautician named, Mika,

18
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,090
who has really good sense.

19
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,390
The appointments are always filled.

20
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,490
Mika, wait a minute!

21
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,490
What is it?

22
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,590
What's this all about?

23
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,790
Like I said, I want to go to another shop.

24
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,190
I'll be quitting next week Monday.

25
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,090
You can't just do as you please.

26
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,590
"Midori Gotoh (39), Manager" -In the first place...

27
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,690
-Madam. -What is it?

28
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,990
The customer is waiting.

29
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,590
I'll be right there, so have her wait a little longer.

30
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,990
Yes.

31
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,390
Anyway, I won't let you do as you please.

32
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,490
Oh, Ayumi.

33
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,390
You're with friends today, aren't you?

34
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,890
Mika, are you quitting?

35
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,790
Another salon has invited me over to work for them.

36
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,390
It's a shock.

37
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:25,290
I wanted to have you cut my hair at least once.

38
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,990
Then, shall I do it for you?

39
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,190
Your mother always asked for me to do her hair,

40
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,690
so this'll be a special service for you.

41
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,690
Really?

42
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,890
But, my appointments are filled until Monday.

43
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,090
That's right. I'll be starting work late tomorrow,

44
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,890
we can do it at my home.

45
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,590
-At your home? -Can we go too?

46
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,890
Sure, all of you can come.

47
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,490
No, I'll pass on this one.

48
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,990
Conan, you're coming too, aren't you? Aren't you?

49
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,690
I got it.

50
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,090
"The next day, Saturday"

51
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,990
"The next day, Saturday" -I got up at 5am this morning.

52
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,790
I was so happy.

53
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,790
Wonder what sort of hairstyle Ayumi is gonna get.

54
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,790
I can't wait to see it.

55
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,490
How peaceful...

56
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,590
but why do you have to come along too?

57
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,190
Oh, what else could there be to observe you,

58
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,790
who's playing the complete role of a child?

59
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,790
Genta, are you all right?

60
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:29,490
Ouch...

61
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,590
Good grief, what're you doing?

62
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,290
Get a hold of yourself.

63
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,590
You see, even the crow is making a fool of you.

64
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,790
No way.

65
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,090
Let's see.

66
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,690
It's that condo.

67
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,490
What am I doing this early in the morning?

68
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,190
Hey, Conan!

69
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,490
What're you daydreaming for?

70
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,790
We're gonna leave you behind!

71
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,090
Oh, sorry...

72
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,590
"301, Mitsui"

73
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,690
Here it is. This is the room.

74
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,790
That's funny, wonder if she forgot her promise.

75
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,990
Maybe she's still sleeping?

76
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,490
That's possible.

77
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,290
She did say that she would be starting work late today.

78
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,090
Huh?

79
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,690
The door's not locked.

80
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,090
Careless, isn't it?

81
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,990
Excuse me,

82
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,590
is Mika here?

83
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,690
Wonder if she went out?

84
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,590
Hey, isn't that Mika sleeping over there?

85
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,190
Hey. Hey, Conan!

86
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,590
Conan...

87
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,390
Mika... what happened?

88
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,090
Murdered.

89
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,390
She's been choked by someone.

90
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,690
The victim is the resident of this room,

91
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,990
Miss Mika Mitsui, age 24.

92
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,790
A beautician who works for the Midori Beauty Salon

93
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,990
in the Beika Town arcade.

94
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,890
I see.

95
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,990
Are you finished?

96
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,390
Yes, please go ahead, Inspector.

97
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,490
Judging from the turbidity of the cornea,

98
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,890
it's been 10 to 13 hours from the time of death.

99
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,990
Cause of death is suffocation.

100
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,890
She was choked with something.

101
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,490
Inspector, what's the matter?

102
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,390
Look.

103
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,290
Choke-marks on her neck are only on the front.

104
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,490
It's true. I wonder why?

105
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,990
Conan.

106
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,690
You shouldn't be in here.

107
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,390
Rather than that, Inspector,

108
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,290
look, there's something blue

109
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,990
on the middle fingernail of her right hand.

110
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,590
Wonder what it is?

111
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,790
I can't say exactly until it's been analyzed,

112
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,490
but probably, it's a bit of plastic.

113
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,590
Plastic.

114
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,190
Midnight snack in the convenience store shopping bag.

115
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,090
A dress that was just picked up from the cleaners.

116
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,190
And, a one-piece dress on the floor

117
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,490
attached with a cleaning tag,

118
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,990
and the plastic bag that's been torn off and thrown away.

119
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,390
Looks like

120
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,390
Mika stopped by the cleaners and the convenient store

121
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:38,490
before coming home and was killed soon after that.

122
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,990
But something...

123
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,090
Something...

124
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,790
Something bothers you, doesn't it?

125
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,490
Yeah.

126
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,490
Me too, something...

127
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,790
Hey! The two of you!

128
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,790
Please, go outside!

129
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,690
This is no place for kids to be wandering around!

130
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,190
But, we're the first ones who found the victim.

131
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,390
I'll listen to the story later.

132
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,190
Please wait in the lobby on the first floor.

133
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,490
Yes.

134
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,690
Takagi, call the Midori Beauty Salon

135
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,990
and have someone identify the corpse.

136
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,490
Yes, sir.

137
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,590
Mika... a thing like this has happened to her.

138
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,590
It's shocking.

139
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:24,290
What is that piece of blue plastic?

140
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,990
Is it a part of something the murderer owns?

141
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,190
Or, the murder weapon?

142
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,790
If so, what could the weapon be...

143
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,690
It's Mrs. Midori.

144
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,590
She's been called by the police to identify the body.

145
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,490
Ah?

146
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,790
Where's she going?

147
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,390
Mrs. Midori!

148
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,990
Ayumi.

149
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,490
Mika's condo is over here.

150
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,790
Yes, you're right.

151
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,590
I'm completely shocked.

152
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,090
But, Ayumi, why are you here?

153
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:18,890
Mika invited us over today and...

154
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,890
Is that so?

155
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,590
You must've been shocked.

156
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,790
Hey, lady.

157
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,190
What is it?

158
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,690
What happened? That bandage.

159
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,090
Huh?

160
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,790
Just a little burn.

161
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,390
I'm really clumsy.

162
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:47,390
Mika. Why did this happen?

163
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,890
Wonder where Midori is going?

164
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,690
She was crying, wasn't she?

165
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,990
Lady, what's the matter?

166
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,490
What were you looking at?

167
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,790
Nothing.

168
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,790
I felt sick and thought I'd get some fresh air.

169
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,590
I'm fine now.

170
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,490
What is it? What was she looking at?

171
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,990
Kudo.

172
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,990
Haibara.

173
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,990
A minute ago, you said something bothered you, didn't you?

174
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,890
Did you find out something?

175
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,690
It's missing.

176
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,890
It should have just come back from the cleaners,

177
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,990
-but, that thing... -That thing?

178
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,890
That's right.

179
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,090
The piece of plastic that was stuck in the fingernail

180
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,190
is the murder weapon.

181
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,890
Maybe...

182
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,590
If that person is the murderer,

183
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,990
what she was looking at from here was...

184
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,390
Oh, no.

185
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,620
Hey! Wait a minute!

186
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,820
Huh?

187
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,720
What's wrong, kid? Why are you so shook up?

188
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,520
Take out all the trash you collected on this street.

189
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,020
There's something important in there, please.

190
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,520
Don't be impossible.

191
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,320
Hurry, hurry.

192
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,320
Hold on a minute.

193
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,720
That girl...

194
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,920
Inspector, people who take their trash out at night

195
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,120
are a problem, aren't they?

196
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,120
What?

197
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,320
If trash are out at night,

198
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,220
people walking pass have the tendency to litter, don't they?

199
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,820
Hey, what are you talking about?

200
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,320
If the collectors pick up the trash the next morning,

201
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,320
the proof will be gone.

202
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,020
Conan, the Inspector and I are busy now

203
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,120
and we can't be bothered with story about trash.

204
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,220
Wait a minute, Takagi.

205
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,620
Excuse me.

206
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,920
Yes.

207
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,220
Has the garbage from that condo been collected yet?

208
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,820
Yes, it has.

209
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,720
Because this area and this street are our last pickups.

210
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,320
Is that so?

211
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,820
I'm very sorry, but can you unload all the garbage

212
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820
that you collected from the parking lot of that condo?

213
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,120
What?

214
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,320
Inspector, is something wrong?

215
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,520
Takagi, the murder weapon.

216
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,920
After the crime was committed,

217
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,520
the murderer might have thrown away the weapon in

218
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,820
with the trash that was put out on the street.

219
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,120
The victim lived alone in the condo.

220
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,820
Chances that the corpse would not be found

221
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,020
until the following morning would be great.

222
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,520
I see, which means that the trash would already

223
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,920
have been collected by the time the investigation started.

224
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,320
Right.

225
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,220
Oh, but, if we don't know what the weapon is,

226
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,120
how can we find it?

227
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,220
That's it.

228
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,320
A while ago, I saw some hangers thrown out

229
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,720
and I thought it was real wasteful.

230
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,620
Hangers?

231
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,020
That's it.

232
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,720
Takagi, I got it.

233
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,320
The murder weapon is a blue plastic hanger.

234
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,420
Huh?

235
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,220
Remember, when you send things to the cleaners,

236
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,120
they come back on those disposable hangers.

237
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,520
Come to think of it, the dress on the floor,

238
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,820
it didn't have a hanger.

239
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,020
The murderer probably

240
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,020
reshaped the hanger on the dress into a ring,

241
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,520
dropped it over her head from behind,

242
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,320
pulled on it and strangled her.

243
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,120
Right,

244
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,620
that's why there were marks only on the front of the neck.

245
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,120
But, why a blue hanger...

246
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,620
Oh...

247
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,720
That's right.

248
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,420
The blue plastic on the victim's fingernail.

249
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,520
That was a piece of the hanger roll.

250
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,520
The victim tried to escape the hanger that was choking her

251
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,320
and grabbed the hanger like this.

252
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,420
At that time, a piece of the hanger was scratched off

253
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,520
with the fingernail of the middle finger of the right hand.

254
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,220
Lady!

255
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,120
Lady, did you come to see the rubbish too?

256
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,120
It must really bother you.

257
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,320
You were looking at it from the rooftop a while ago too.

258
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,020
You even tried to come this way

259
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:34,220
when you first arrived at the condo too.

260
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,220
No, little boy, what're you talking about?

261
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:42,220
I just wondered why all of you were gathered here.

262
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,020
I'm sorry, this is a murder investigation,

263
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,520
please cooperate with us.

264
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,320
I understand.

265
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,220
If my intuitions are right,

266
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,420
there should be proof of the murderer left on the hanger.

267
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,920
Clear, unmovable proof.

268
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,920
There's this much.

269
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,620
Well, it's all compressed and loaded into collection vehicles.

270
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,420
All right, please divide up and start.

271
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,620
Wonder if they'll really find it.

272
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,220
They'll find it. The Inspector seems to have confidence.

273
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,720
Inspector, it wasn't there.

274
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,020
We've looked through all of it but...

275
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,820
That can't be! Check it better...

276
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,120
Conan.

277
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,920
I'm sorry.

278
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,820
Why... why wasn't it found?

279
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,620
Inspector, what do you want to do?

280
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:25,420
Anyway, let's help out and clear away the place.

281
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,520
And, politely thank the collectors.

282
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,320
I understand.

283
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,220
Ms. Gotoh.

284
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,320
Pardon my rudeness, but...

285
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,120
Where were you and what were you doing

286
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,520
between 8pm and 11pm last night?

287
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,220
Why are you asking me that?

288
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,120
Oh, just for the records.

289
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,920
Are you saying that I killed Mika?

290
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,920
You've got to be joking. Why me?

291
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,120
But, you were arguing with Mika yesterday.

292
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,520
Mika said she wanted to change shops

293
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,720
and you said you wouldn't let her do as she pleased.

294
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,620
I definitely said that, but...

295
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,920
Ms. Gotoh, will you please come down to headquarters

296
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,720
and give us the details?

297
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,320
I refuse. I took time off from work to come here.

298
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,220
If you demand that I go,

299
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,420
show me proof that I'm the criminal.

300
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,020
Excuse me.

301
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,420
Inspector.

302
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:42,220
Judging from her reaction, there's no doubt that

303
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,720
she threw away the hanger in this garbage.

304
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,120
Then...

305
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,120
It's my intuition, but...

306
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,820
There's probably no mistake that she's the murderer.

307
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,520
It's just as Inspector Megure says.

308
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,720
Judging from her actions, there's no doubt about it.

309
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,620
But, why didn't the hanger come out...

310
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,720
Why...

311
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,120
I can't believe Ms. Midori is the murderer.

312
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:14,420
But, Inspector Megure said that there's no doubt about it.

313
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:18,020
Then, I wonder why the hanger wasn't found.

314
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,120
Maybe someone picked it up.

315
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,620
You know, sometimes people pick up things that

316
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,820
they think are still usable.

317
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,920
Yeah, I've picked up a Kamen Yaiba doll before too.

318
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,920
Genta, that's dirty.

319
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,920
That's not something to boast about.

320
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,820
Isn't that right, Conan?

321
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,620
What's the matter?

322
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,920
It's a net to keep the crows out of the trash.

323
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,920
Conan, is something wrong with it?

324
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,920
Maybe, it was a crow that went off with the hanger.

325
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,920
Do crows eat hangers?

326
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,320
They use it to build nests.

327
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,220
Possible. I saw on television that crows in the city

328
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,420
use things like hangers and wire to build their nests.

329
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,520
Then, if we find the nest...

330
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,520
Okay. The Youth Detective Squad'll start a crow's nest search!

331
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,820
There's a crow's nest?

332
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,920
Yes, it's making its nest right now.

333
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,120
Which tree is it?

334
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,920
No, it's not in a tree, it's over there.

335
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,520
It's on that light pole.

336
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,520
It's there. A crow's nest.

337
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:04,020
We found it. The blue hanger.

338
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,620
Ms. Gotoh.

339
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,520
This is the murder weapon, the hanger.

340
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,320
The piece of plastic from the victim's fingernail

341
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,920
and the scratched portion from this hanger

342
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,620
made a perfect match.

343
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,920
Furthermore, there's a little bit of blood

344
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,120
on the tip of this wire.

345
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,520
But, it's been confirmed that

346
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,420
it's not the same type blood as the victim.

347
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,020
We think that it got on the hanger

348
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,520
when the murderer was strangling the victim

349
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,220
and cut his hand.

350
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,020
Ms. Gotoh, can you take off the bandage

351
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,320
on the back of your right hand?

352
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,620
That girl...

353
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,220
she threw the hanger at me.

354
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,920
I went to ask her not to quit the shop.

355
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,920
Please, if it's about your salary, I'll reconsider it.

356
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,620
Let go of me.

357
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,820
I'm going to do as I please.

358
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,820
Please go home.

359
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,420
I couldn't forgive her.

360
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,520
Forgetting the gratitude

361
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,820
and throwing that hanger at me.

362
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,520
Is that your reason?

363
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,820
Did you take a person's life for a worthless reason like that?

364
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,720
I'm glad the case is solved but...

365
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,020
I still can't believe it.

366
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,020
They both were so kind to me.

367
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,120
People have different sides to them.

368
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,320
Hey...

369
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,120
That crow doesn't it look like he's glaring at us?

370
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,220
Maybe, they're mad at us for taking the hanger from the nest?

371
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,120
Which means...

372
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,220
We won't be able to come to this park for a while.
