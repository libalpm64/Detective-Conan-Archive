1
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,980
Today's case is a very odd one.

2
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,980
Identical twins are killed at the same time in different towns.

3
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,580
Such a thing is just not possible!

4
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,180
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,080
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,380
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:59,641
"Beika Sports Center"

8
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:23,541
"Shoichiro Hitomi, (45)" -I beg you, give me a few more days.

9
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:26,541
Just a while longer!

10
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:31,741
I've waited and waited all this time.

11
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:33,541
I can't wait any longer.

12
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:37,741
Why don't you ask your younger brother for help?

13
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:43,441
If only I could do so...

14
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:50,441
"A Case of Synchronicity (Part 1)"

15
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,841
What shall I do? What can I do?

16
00:03:15,441 --> 00:03:17,541
Men's room.

17
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:29,741
-Hello? -Oh, Dad.

18
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:31,141
Oh, Ran.

19
00:03:31,141 --> 00:03:33,041
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Dad, what about lunch?

20
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,541
Do you think that you'll be coming home?

21
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,341
I'm still working.

22
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,141
Okay, then I'm going with Ran

23
00:03:39,141 --> 00:03:42,041
to the "Super Cheap All-You-Can Eat Buffet"

24
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,741
so keep up your good work, Pops.

25
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:49,641
The Super Cheap All-You-Can Eat place?

26
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,641
But he really takes a long time.

27
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,841
Wait, could it be that he noticed me?

28
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:13,441
What the...

29
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:16,141
He seems like a totally different person from a while ago.

30
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:23,241
Oh, well.

31
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:37,141
"Beika Hotel"

32
00:04:50,341 --> 00:04:51,741
Dad.

33
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:54,841
You two... what brings you both here?

34
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:57,041
I mentioned it over the phone, didn't I?

35
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,141
Over there.

36
00:04:58,141 --> 00:04:59,941
"Adult 980 yen, Child 600 yen" -Look.

37
00:04:59,941 --> 00:05:01,041
"Restaurant Chuka Cuisine Buffet"

38
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:04,441
So this is where you two were talking about.

39
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,641
Oh, I mean this is no time for something like this.

40
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:13,841
Excuse me!

41
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:18,141
I'm Minamizato of room 1050,

42
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:19,741
"Kaoru Minamizato, (25)" -Uh...

43
00:05:19,741 --> 00:05:23,141
Do you have something for me from a person called Mr. Anzai?

44
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:27,541
No, ma'am.

45
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,041
It can't be because I got a call a while ago

46
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,241
saying that the package was delivered here.

47
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:33,941
Please check carefully once more.

48
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:43,441
Oops...

49
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:47,841
We don't seem to have anything for you after all.

50
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,941
I see.

51
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,141
It's good.

52
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:02,241
I feel bad for dad, though.

53
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:04,941
It can't be helped because he's working.

54
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:12,041
What happened?

55
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,541
-A man fell. -What is it?

56
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,941
Conan!

57
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:18,841
It was the man we saw just a while ago!

58
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:20,341
Which means that...

59
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:21,441
Pops!

60
00:06:24,241 --> 00:06:25,941
How can something like this happen?

61
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:28,341
While I was tailing him...

62
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:45,841
Shoichiro Hitomi, age 45.

63
00:06:45,841 --> 00:06:47,941
I've been tailing him since this morning.

64
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:51,241
However, please do not ask me who asked me to do so.

65
00:06:51,241 --> 00:06:54,841
What on earth happened?

66
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:56,641
Let me explain.

67
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:48,241
I didn't want him to know that I was tailing him but...

68
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:50,941
No! Don't!

69
00:07:50,941 --> 00:07:52,841
What's wrong?

70
00:07:52,841 --> 00:07:54,341
Is anything the matter?

71
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:58,341
Don't tell me that...

72
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:07,241
Are you okay?

73
00:08:08,141 --> 00:08:09,441
You're...

74
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:19,541
Sorry, I don't know what's come over me.

75
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,141
Just what are you talking about?

76
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:24,841
Never mind that, hurry and get down from there!

77
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:31,141
No, please overlook this.

78
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:48,541
Ms. Minamizato,

79
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:52,241
what is your connection with Mr. Shoichiro Hitomi?

80
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,641
I don't know.

81
00:08:53,641 --> 00:08:54,641
Huh?

82
00:08:54,641 --> 00:08:56,841
I'd like to ask you that question myself.

83
00:08:56,841 --> 00:09:01,241
Who on earth is this Mr. Hitomi?

84
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:04,641
He tried to attack you, you know.

85
00:09:04,641 --> 00:09:06,541
What do you mean you don't know?

86
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,541
It can't be the case.

87
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:12,141
It's true! I really don't know who he is!

88
00:09:12,141 --> 00:09:13,441
But...

89
00:09:14,141 --> 00:09:16,841
-Ms. Kaoru Minamizato. -Yes, sir?

90
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:19,841
That's the name you registered on the guest list,

91
00:09:19,841 --> 00:09:23,441
but isn't your real name Kanako Hitomi?

92
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:26,841
And, who's that supposed to be?

93
00:09:26,841 --> 00:09:30,941
The wife of Shoichiro's younger brother, Takehiko.

94
00:09:30,941 --> 00:09:35,641
No, inspector, I've seen Kanako in a picture but...

95
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,341
Why did you think so?

96
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:41,341
When I checked the history of incoming calls on Shoichiro's cell phone,

97
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:46,741
the last person he had called to was Kanako Hitomi.

98
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:50,041
Calls? What time was it?

99
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,741
11.20am.

100
00:09:51,741 --> 00:09:53,741
Oh, if so...

101
00:09:53,741 --> 00:09:56,341
He went in at 11.10am

102
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:59,641
and came out at 11.30am.

103
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:04,441
I guess, Shoichiro...

104
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:08,041
He called his brother's wife from inside the toilet during this time.

105
00:10:11,241 --> 00:10:14,441
May I be excused, now?

106
00:10:15,341 --> 00:10:18,341
I'm sorry, I'd like to be left alone.

107
00:10:20,741 --> 00:10:23,241
The name was Anzai, wasn't it?

108
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:29,241
You know, the name you mentioned at the front desk a while ago.

109
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:32,741
Is there anything for me from a person called Mr. Anzai?

110
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:36,841
I know Mr. Anzai.

111
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:38,741
Is anything wrong with that?

112
00:10:38,741 --> 00:10:40,041
No.

113
00:10:46,741 --> 00:10:51,641
Gosh. What an outright lie to say she doesn't know Shoichiro.

114
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:53,641
Maybe she really doesn't know him.

115
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:55,841
No darn way!

116
00:10:55,841 --> 00:10:57,341
Huh?

117
00:10:57,341 --> 00:10:58,541
What happened?

118
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:02,041
Pops, don't you think this is strange?

119
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,441
What's strange?

120
00:11:03,441 --> 00:11:07,141
Because Shoichiro had a cell phone, didn't he?

121
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:10,641
Then why did he use the public phone?

122
00:11:10,641 --> 00:11:13,041
Maybe his phone was out of the service area.

123
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,141
It doesn't seem to be so.

124
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,741
Look.

125
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:18,241
True.

126
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:20,241
Mouri! Bad news!

127
00:11:20,241 --> 00:11:21,841
What's the matter?

128
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:24,841
Look at that TV over there.

129
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:27,841
This is the site of the crime, Haido Condo.

130
00:11:27,841 --> 00:11:29,741
The man who was killed is...

131
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:32,541
"Takehiko Hitomi, (45)" -It's Takehiko,

132
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,841
Mr. Shoichiro's younger brother.

133
00:11:35,741 --> 00:11:37,641
The same age...

134
00:11:37,641 --> 00:11:39,341
You mean...

135
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:40,941
they're twins!

136
00:11:40,941 --> 00:11:42,441
The estimated time of death

137
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:45,641
is around 12.15pm in the afternoon today.

138
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:49,841
No way. 12.15pm is when Shoichiro...

139
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:53,041
It happened at the same time?

140
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:56,441
No way. Is something like that possible?

141
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:05,819
What?

142
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:08,819
The one that asked you to investigate on Shoichiro

143
00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:12,519
was his younger brother, Takehiko who was killed at Haido-cho?

144
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:13,619
Yes.

145
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:19,219
And, what did Takehiko want you to do?

146
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:21,119
To check on his behavior.

147
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,819
According to Takehiko, Shoichiro, because of the fact that

148
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:27,419
they were identical twins who looked exactly alike,

149
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:33,219
may have been posing to be him and doing fraudulent business.

150
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,019
Oh, and what did you come up with?

151
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:37,119
Nothing definite yet.

152
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:40,219
But he really did have a large amount of debt,

153
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:41,519
and he was being pressured by the loan-sharks

154
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,219
to return the money this morning.

155
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,419
Which means...

156
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:49,419
that Shoichiro came to Beika Hotel

157
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:53,019
because he came up with some good idea to pay the money back?

158
00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:57,319
Synchronicity!

159
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:59,919
What's with you, shouting out of the blue?

160
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,719
To think that the older and younger brother who were twins

161
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:04,119
died at the same time,

162
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:06,619
seems to be a coincidence...

163
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,119
However, maybe that's not all there is to it.

164
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:11,919
Maybe there was something more fateful involved there.

165
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:14,019
You mean that's synchro...

166
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:16,119
Synchronicity.

167
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:19,419
That's the theory that Psychologist Jung came up with.

168
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:28,119
You know, maybe it's the same as how we ran into you at this hotel, dad.

169
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:31,719
I see, I guess you could say so.

170
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:34,319
There is a possibility of it being a coincidence,

171
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:36,119
but I wonder...

172
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:39,219
Right, everything fits in too well.

173
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:42,619
We've got to scrutinize that two cases more closely.

174
00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:45,619
The door was locked.

175
00:13:45,619 --> 00:13:48,519
There are no signs of the door being forced opened either.

176
00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:52,819
What an odd looking key hole.

177
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:55,819
It wouldn't be easy to make a spare key.

178
00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:03,919
Was he killed here?

179
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,619
As you can see, the window is cracked from the outside.

180
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:19,619
It seems to have been a robbery.

181
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:25,419
If Takehiko was really killed by someone who broke in to rob him,

182
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:29,119
it would have nothing to do with the case in Beika-cho.

183
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,719
Could it actually be a mere coincidence?

184
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:38,919
"Kanako Hitomi, (36)" -You returned home around 2pm,

185
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:44,119
saw your husband dead, and called the police?

186
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:45,119
Yes, sir.

187
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:47,719
And, where did you return home from?

188
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:49,619
Beika-cho.

189
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:53,119
-Beika-cho? -Beika...

190
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:57,419
Is anything wrong?

191
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:00,319
Is this supposed to be synchronicity too?

192
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:04,819
We were at Beika-cho just before coming here.

193
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,219
I see.

194
00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:11,319
Shoichiro fell to his death from Beika Hotel.

195
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:14,119
Shoichiro did...

196
00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:17,519
Oh no, is that true?

197
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,919
It's true.

198
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,819
Could it be that you went to Beika-cho

199
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:25,219
to meet Shoichiro there?

200
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:27,519
The thing is, we found after checking the outgoing calls

201
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,519
that he made on his cell phone, that he had called you.

202
00:15:32,619 --> 00:15:33,819
Yes.

203
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:38,019
Please tell us what he wanted to talk to you about.

204
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:40,119
Shoichiro mentioned that

205
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:41,919
he wanted to make up with my husband

206
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:45,419
and asked me to act as their go-between.

207
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:48,419
Oh, make up.

208
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:49,719
Yes.

209
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:51,619
The thing is...

210
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:53,919
Shoichiro and Takehiko

211
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:57,619
had been working at father's company for quite some time

212
00:15:57,619 --> 00:16:01,019
and there were times when the subject of

213
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:03,619
who will be succeeding father came up.

214
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:06,819
However, just about then, father suddenly passed away.

215
00:16:08,219 --> 00:16:09,919
Why is it you?

216
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:12,319
Why are you, my kid brother, the president?

217
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:15,219
Don't ask me, it was in father's will!

218
00:16:15,219 --> 00:16:17,919
Well, it is not hard to understand why dad picked me.

219
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,019
What?

220
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:22,819
I hear your wife went back to her home country.

221
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:26,719
Didn't you realize that she was only after your money?

222
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,619
That's what father based his decision on.

223
00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:30,119
Shut up!

224
00:16:33,819 --> 00:16:36,219
You're fired. Get out of here, this minute!

225
00:16:36,219 --> 00:16:41,619
"Hitomi's Trade Company" -Shoichiro then started a company of his own

226
00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:44,419
but, it didn't work out either and went bankrupt

227
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:46,919
leaving him deeply in debt.

228
00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:51,019
Then, several nights ago...

229
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:57,319
I apologize. Please, I was wrong.

230
00:16:58,219 --> 00:17:00,019
So, please...

231
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,619
No, I beg you.

232
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:04,619
I... I need money...

233
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,419
I don't owe you anything.

234
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,719
If only...

235
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:24,519
If only you weren't here...

236
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:28,319
I wanted them to make up

237
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,019
and become the two brothers that I had know before.

238
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:32,619
Therefore,

239
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:35,419
without letting my husband know,

240
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:38,219
I secretly gave Shoichiro my cell phone number,

241
00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:40,619
as well as the spare key to the house.

242
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:46,319
On the other hand, Takehiko thinking that Shoichiro

243
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:48,519
being as cornered as he was,

244
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:51,919
may scheme up something using his name,

245
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,419
asked me to keep an eye on him.

246
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:58,419
To think that both of them would die at the same time...

247
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:00,219
Is this a coincidence...

248
00:18:00,219 --> 00:18:02,019
or rather, some work of fate?

249
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:07,719
What did Shoichiro want when he called Kanako?

250
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:11,419
Didn't you hear? He wanted to make up with his brother.

251
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:13,819
Rather, please, I'd like to know too.

252
00:18:13,819 --> 00:18:16,219
Could you tell us more in detail what the call was about?

253
00:18:16,219 --> 00:18:17,519
Yes, sir.

254
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:27,219
-Hello? -Is Takehiko there?

255
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:30,619
Yes, he is. Would you like me to get him?

256
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:31,919
No, never mind.

257
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,019
I see.

258
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:38,419
Rather, I'd like to discuss something with you, Kanako.

259
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:41,619
I'd like to make up with Takehiko,

260
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:43,919
but I wonder if you could act as go-between for us.

261
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,519
Really? That's great.

262
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:48,819
Yes, of course, I'd be happy to!

263
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:51,719
Will you please come meet me at Beika-cho then?

264
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:53,219
Where in Beika-cho?

265
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:57,319
Beika Station at 12.30pm in front of the wicket.

266
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,519
Bye.

267
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:01,519
"Beika Station"

268
00:19:03,219 --> 00:19:05,519
But, although I waited for quite some time,

269
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,019
Shoichiro never showed up.

270
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:16,119
I had no idea that things would turn out this way.

271
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:29,419
I wonder if he was planning to see her

272
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:33,119
after he finished what he had to do at Beika Hotel.

273
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:34,519
I guess so.

274
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:38,319
Only, that's if we believe Kanako's story.

275
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:41,119
I don't see any reason why we shouldn't.

276
00:19:42,219 --> 00:19:45,719
For instance, for her to sneak into Takehiko's house

277
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:47,319
using that tree over there,

278
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,619
no matter how you look at it,

279
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:50,919
it's impossible for her to do so.

280
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:54,919
I guess so, which means that it is a robbery case after all.

281
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:56,819
If so...

282
00:19:56,819 --> 00:20:01,019
The two cases are not related to each other in any way.

283
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:04,519
It can only be explained as a case of "synchronicity".

284
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:08,519
But, just to be on the safe side, let's check on Kanako's alibi too.

285
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:09,819
Alibi?

286
00:20:11,219 --> 00:20:13,819
If Shoichiro didn't die...

287
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:16,919
"Shoichiro, Takehiko, Kanako" -He would've met with Kanako

288
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,319
and they would both have a perfect alibi.

289
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,619
This would exclude them from

290
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:23,919
the suspect list of Takehiko's homicide case.

291
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,019
But...

292
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:28,119
Shoichiro fell to his death in Beika.

293
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:31,819
And, another character, Kaoru Minamizato comes into the picture.

294
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:33,519
Although this case involved a simple relationship

295
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:34,719
between two brothers and the wife,

296
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:36,719
"Shoichiro, Minamizato" -the appearance of Kaoru

297
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:39,319
makes the structure of the case even more complex.

298
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:42,519
Kaoru Minamizato.

299
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:44,519
Who on earth is she anyway?

300
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:48,819
But I really don't know who he is!

301
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:51,119
How can you say you don't know him?

302
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,119
He attacked you, didn't he, Shoichiro?

303
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:58,319
He must've hand a grudge on you or jealous of you or something.

304
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:00,119
You don't know him.

305
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:03,119
That's something that is totally unbelievable.

306
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:05,319
Just what do I have to do to get you to believe me?

307
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:07,619
Please tell us the truth!

308
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:10,619
It's true, I'm not lying!

309
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:12,119
Why would I lie to you after going through

310
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:14,219
something frightening like that?

311
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:16,019
God, you tell me...

312
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:19,419
Why... why is it like this?

313
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:21,519
Why?

314
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:24,819
Why is this all happening to me?

315
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,219
The incident in Haido-cho is a homicide

316
00:21:36,219 --> 00:21:38,119
so investigation will continue

317
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:40,719
but this incident can probably be closed as an accident.

318
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:43,119
Is this a mere accident?

319
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:45,619
Well, it's true that the fact that Shoichiro falling to his death

320
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:47,219
was an accident,

321
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:50,219
but what about the fact that he attacked Kaoru?

322
00:21:50,219 --> 00:21:51,519
Assault and battery.

323
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,419
Maybe it's a case of attempted homicide.

324
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:55,919
Even so, the case is closed through the death of the suspect

325
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,219
and when the necessary papers are turned in.

326
00:21:58,219 --> 00:22:00,319
How can it be?

327
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,119
I'm sure she's hiding something, though.

328
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:05,719
I wonder if she's trying to protect someone.

329
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:08,419
I'm sure the press will pursue this case though as an odd case,

330
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:10,219
in which twin brothers died at the same time

331
00:22:10,219 --> 00:22:13,419
in two separate places.

332
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:15,819
Maybe it's "synchronicity" after all.

333
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:18,419
"Shoichiro, Takehiko" -Wrong, that's not it.

334
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:21,119
"Kanako, Kaoru Minamizato" -This is not a case of synchronicity.

335
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:24,619
The line that connects Kaoru with the others.

336
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:27,219
If I can figure out what that is, the mystery would be solved.

337
00:22:27,219 --> 00:22:30,919
Why did Shoichiro attack,

338
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:33,719
rather, try to kill Kaoru?

339
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,519
For what reason?

340
00:24:31,746 --> 00:24:34,046
Next Conan's Hint:

341
00:24:34,046 --> 00:24:36,246
"Detective Kogoro's investigation"

342
00:24:36,246 --> 00:24:38,146
In the next episode, Pop's investigation comes in really handy.

343
00:24:38,146 --> 00:24:40,546
-How unusual. -Really?
