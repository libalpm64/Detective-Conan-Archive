1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,140
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,240
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,940
Today, there is a coffee shop located by a slope.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,240
A truck Is this a case or an accident?

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,740
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,190
I can't walk anymore.

9
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,090
Hey, hang in there.

10
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,890
Just a little more to go.

11
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,990
According to Dr. Agasa's map, it's right around the curve up ahead.

12
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,790
Hang in there, Genta.

13
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,290
Maybe taking the bus would've been faster.

14
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,990
No way. We're going to be treated to lunch,

15
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,290
so if we take the bus it would render everything meaningless.

16
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,990
You mean you just wanted to save bus fare?

17
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,990
What a tight brat...

18
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:32,090
"Coffee Shop Truck Crash"

19
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:37,190
It's supposed to be around here...

20
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,590
Mitsuhiko, isn't that it?

21
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,990
Peach Sunday.

22
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,690
This is the place after all.

23
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,290
Can you read English, Mitsuhiko?

24
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,690
I'm bilingual.

25
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,190
Come on let's go inside. I'm starved.

26
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,590
Yes, let's go.

27
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,790
Hello.

28
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,290
We're...

29
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,890
The Youth Detective Squad, right?

30
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,990
You're going to meet with Dr. Agasa here, aren't you?

31
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,290
-This way please. -All right...

32
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,690
I'm hungry.

33
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,990
I want the window seat.

34
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,690
Hi, welcome to our shop.

35
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,890
Dr. Agasa called me about you.

36
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,590
He said that he's going to be a little late,

37
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,090
so for you to eat anything you like.

38
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,090
It looks so good!

39
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,190
Hey, Genta, ladies first.

40
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,990
Of course!

41
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,290
Here you go.

42
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,690
Thank you.

43
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,190
Welcome.

44
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,590
My name is Ohara. I have reservations.

45
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,390
Please come this way.

46
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,590
The most recommended menu here is Peach Sundae.

47
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,090
It's the master's original menu.

48
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,590
I'll take that, then.

49
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,290
Me too.

50
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,490
What would you like, Conan?

51
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,290
The same as all of you is fine.

52
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,390
Four Peach Sundaes please.

53
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,790
Okay.

54
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,790
It looks delicious!

55
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,090
This is really delicious.

56
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,890
-You see. -Aren't you going to eat, Conan?

57
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,690
Give it to me then.

58
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,490
-Genta. -What a waste if the ice cream melts.

59
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,890
What's that?

60
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,590
-Leaflets again? -It's a rush job.

61
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,290
"Kazuo Ohara (52)" -They're going to be passing it out

62
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,190
"Ohara Planning's President" -at the shopping arcade this coming Sunday.

63
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,190
"Toru Aida (35)" -You should just refuse such a cheap paying job.

64
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,790
"Ohara Planning's Designer" -I can't do that.

65
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,790
This is the kind of job that leads to a stable income. Right?

66
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,190
Right.

67
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,890
Will you think about it for me?

68
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,190
No matter how many times you ask me, my answer will not change.

69
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,390
Is it money you want? If so I'll increase the amount...

70
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,390
I don't think you can, with the work that you're doing now.

71
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,090
Maybe not just yet,

72
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,590
but I promise that someday I'll...

73
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,990
There you go again.

74
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,590
Can't you do something about it?

75
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,990
Talk about persistence.

76
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:07,290
I don't want to end my life making leaflets.

77
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,890
Working with you is ruining my talent.

78
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,190
Take it easy.

79
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,090
I'll bet you don't have any gripes on the pamphlets of the resort hotel

80
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,290
that I'm asking you to work on this time.

81
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,590
Yeah, as for that, I'll take the job as retirement pay.

82
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,490
You can't handle it anyway if I leave, can you?

83
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,890
What?

84
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,990
But, I promise to finish these leaflets

85
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,090
before I leave.

86
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,890
Let's get started. You're in a rush, aren't you?

87
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,590
To do this leaflets.

88
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,790
I'm going to the restroom.

89
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,990
Jeepers, it was that delicious.

90
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,490
Two of them?

91
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,890
Talk about fast.

92
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,990
Mitsuhiko, what's your second recommendation?

93
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,390
You'll get a stomach ache if you eat too much.

94
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,690
I'll be fine, no big deal.

95
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:15,790
-I told you so. -I have to go to the restroom.

96
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,590
Genta somebody's using the restroom now...

97
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,290
Somebody's inside.

98
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,890
That was good.

99
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,290
It's indeed worth recommending.

100
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,390
Genta, someone was inside, right?

101
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,590
Yeah.

102
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,990
I don't know who's in there,

103
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,490
but he doesn't answer when I knock.

104
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,990
I feel like I'm going to explode.

105
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,090
He's come out.

106
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,390
It can't be.

107
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,590
You mean the guest.

108
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,890
Saved.

109
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,490
If you're going to order another serving, order one for me too!

110
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,890
He's using his right hand this time.

111
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,490
Talk about skill.

112
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,890
He's ambidextrous.

113
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,990
Hello.

114
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,290
- Dr. Agasa. -I'm sorry I'm late.

115
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,290
We're all digging in.

116
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,290
Eat all you like.

117
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,790
I won the raffle at the shopping arcade.

118
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,390
Okay then, I'll take...

119
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,890
Chocolate parfait, pudding a la mode

120
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,490
and strawberry shortcake!

121
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,990
Is your stomach okay?

122
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,590
No problem, no problem.

123
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,490
Look, look at that bus.

124
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,590
I wonder what it is. It's beautiful.

125
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,690
True.

126
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,390
I think I dropped my lighter. I'll go check.

127
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,590
I want it done by sundown.

128
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,190
I'm counting on you.

129
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,290
Yes, yes.

130
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,290
Conan, what are you going to have?

131
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,590
I'll have coffee.

132
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,690
Coffee?

133
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,490
Oh, no, I mean...

134
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,990
What is this?

135
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,790
What is this?

136
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,290
Which means that you just happened to leave your seat,

137
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,190
so you were spared?

138
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,690
Yes, I just happened to go to the restroom to look for my lighter.

139
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,890
Thank goodness you were spared.

140
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,190
You're the president of Ohara Planning.

141
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,890
The office is located right above this hill, isn't it?

142
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,390
Mr. Saito.

143
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,490
I've found the driver of the truck!

144
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,490
Okay, I'll be right there.

145
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,490
Did you park your car part way up the slope like this

146
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,290
and make your delivery?

147
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,490
I'm sorry,

148
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,590
"Jiro Kobayashi (25)" -I usually park on a flat place

149
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,790
"Courier" -up the slope

150
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,290
but that car was parked here today,

151
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,490
so I had no choice but to park my car in front of it.

152
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,190
I made sure my side brakes were locked

153
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,690
and had my gear in reverse just to be safe.

154
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,290
Mr. Saito, I went to the site right away

155
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,290
and checked the driver's seat

156
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,290
but the side brakes weren't locked.

157
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,690
It can't be.

158
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,290
Please check more carefully.

159
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,790
I'm positive that I pulled my side brakes and locked it.

160
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,190
Of course he's lying.

161
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,190
Aida was...

162
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,890
Aida was my precious right hand man.

163
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:40,690
Without him, my company is finished.

164
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,490
Oh no... did someone pass away?

165
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,490
President.

166
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,690
Segawa.

167
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,590
What are you doing in a place like this?

168
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,690
"Michiko Segawa (46)" -If we don't deposit the money today,

169
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,490
"Ohara Planning's employee" -they're going to stop shipment of the goods!

170
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,690
I know.

171
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,990
But, this is no time for something like that.

172
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,090
-Aida passed away. -What?

173
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,090
He got mixed up in an accident.

174
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,090
Oh no.

175
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:18,290
Strange. I wonder what it means.

176
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,590
- Conan. -Conan.

177
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,890
Hey, this place is off limits.

178
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,290
I forgot something in the restroom.

179
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,490
He was licking his finger

180
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,290
when he first came out of the restroom.

181
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,590
I wonder if he got hurt in the restroom?

182
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,590
But why?

183
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,590
Blood stains?

184
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,490
These are traces of a hand touching the frame from outside!

185
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,290
I see.

186
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:17,190
The blood got here when he came back from outside.

187
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,890
That's why there was no answer when Genta knocked.

188
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:24,690
Mr. Ohara wasn't in the toilet then.

189
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:31,190
He hurt his left hand when he was outside.

190
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:36,990
That's why he held the pencil in his right hand after coming back.

191
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:42,190
But, where did he go to do what?

192
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,390
Before the accident,

193
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,690
Mr. Ohara seemed very concerned about the time.

194
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:03,190
Did he have to go out at a certain time?

195
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,690
Time...

196
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:09,690
Conan, where were you?

197
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,290
I just went to get something I forgot.

198
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:20,090
Does anybody remember what time the accident occurred?

199
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,790
About 2:30 pm.

200
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,890
It was right after Dr. Agasa got here.

201
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,590
2:30 pm.

202
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,690
There's one at 2:07 pm.

203
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,390
-Is something wrong? -Yeah.

204
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,390
I wonder what route the bus that left here

205
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,390
just before the accident took place?

206
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,290
I think it's about time it'll come back.

207
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,690
It supposed to make a round from the apartment complex back

208
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,790
to the shopping arcade.

209
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,190
Why was that bus parked?

210
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,590
This is the terminal as well as the depot,

211
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,590
so the buses take a 5 to 10 minutes time adjustment break time.

212
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,490
What is it?

213
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,790
Do we have a case?

214
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,090
No fair, Conan!

215
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,990
You're always hogging the clues!

216
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,790
He's right!

217
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,290
Hey, I'd like to ask you kids some questions too.

218
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,690
So come here, will you?

219
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:28,690
Okay!

220
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,490
A piano cord?

221
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,390
I see, I've got it.

222
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:42,290
This is homicide! And the killer is...

223
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,190
I'm sure it's him!

224
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,670
Officer.

225
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,070
Yes?

226
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,370
I have some urgent business to attend to

227
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,470
so I'd like to be excused for a while.

228
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,870
We can't allow that.

229
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,470
I have to go make a transfer to one of my clients.

230
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,970
30 minutes... no, 20 minutes will do.

231
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,170
Please.

232
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,170
Has he been interrogated?

233
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,970
Yes, briefly.

234
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,670
I guess you can go then.

235
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,570
Thank you so much.

236
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,770
No good.

237
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:19,670
If he is released, he'll go and get rid of all the evidence.

238
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,170
Dr. Agasa.

239
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,570
This is homicide.

240
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,870
What?

241
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,870
-Move your lips like always for me. -Okay.

242
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,270
Wait just a minute!

243
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,470
Who, me?

244
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,070
Yes, I can't have you leave just yet.

245
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,670
What are you talking about?

246
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,170
We've got a homicide case.

247
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,070
Who are you?

248
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:49,270
I am Dr. Agasa.

249
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,270
Will outsiders stay out of this?

250
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,770
Hold it, let's at least hear him out.

251
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,270
Dr. Agasa, do you have any leads?

252
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,270
I not only have a lead, I even have proof.

253
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:03,570
Mr. Ohara, I have proof that you are the killer.

254
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,970
Don't be ridiculous.

255
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,370
No matter how you look at it,

256
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,170
this is an accident caused by the carelessness of the driver

257
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,970
whose truck crashed into the shop.

258
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,170
That's not true.

259
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,570
I'm all ears, Dr. Agasa.

260
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:22,470
All right, let me start with the trick involved in this case.

261
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,970
Nonsense.

262
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,570
I'm a busy man.

263
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:28,370
I don't have time to waste listening to a fabricated story.

264
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,970
Mr. Ohara.

265
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,970
It'll just be a short while, so let's hear him out.

266
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,870
Please go ahead.

267
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:42,170
Mr. Ohara, you parked your car on the top of the hill

268
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,470
where the courier truck always parks.

269
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,570
Then you asked Mr. Aida to come with you to the coffee shop

270
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,270
at the bottom of the hill.

271
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,770
And then, you made him sit by the window

272
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,070
so that he couldn't see the slope from his side.

273
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,870
Isn't that right?

274
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,170
No.

275
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:01,370
I didn't make him sit by the window so that he couldn't see the slope.

276
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,370
The place he sat just happened to be by the window.

277
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,670
I see.

278
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:10,170
Then, you left a while later in the middle of negotiations

279
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,970
pretending to go to the restroom.

280
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,670
I wasn't pretending.

281
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,770
I really went to the restroom.

282
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,070
That's strange.

283
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,970
Genta here says,

284
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,470
he tried knocking at the door many times

285
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,370
but you didn't answer.

286
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:28,770
That's right. My stomach was so sore, I thought I'd die.

287
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,470
That's because...

288
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,970
Back then, you snuck out of the toilet,

289
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,970
and went over to the courier truck.

290
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:41,270
You placed a wooden linchpin that you had set up beforehand

291
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,370
in front of the front tires of the truck.

292
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,770
Don't be ridiculous.

293
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,870
Why would I have to do something like that?

294
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:54,070
It was a trick to make it look like you weren't committing the crime.

295
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,370
You tied a piano cord to that linchpin,

296
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,770
and then tied the piano cord

297
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,270
onto the rear end of the bus that was parked for time adjustment.

298
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:07,270
Then, you shifted the gear of the courier to neutral,

299
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,670
and released the side brake.

300
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:13,870
You then returned to the coffee shop as if nothing had happened.

301
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,470
When the time came, and the bus leaves,

302
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,470
the linchpin would come off.

303
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,270
That would make the courier truck,

304
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:26,070
roll down the hill on its own.

305
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,670
All you had to do next, was wait for the bus to go by the coffee shop

306
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,970
and get out of the way

307
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:35,770
by pretending to go to the restroom to look for your lighter.

308
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,070
I see!

309
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,070
The thing that was shimmering at the rear end of the bus

310
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,870
was the piano cord.

311
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,670
Yes. And this is that stopper.

312
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,670
Lets see...

313
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,870
You mean this?

314
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,370
-Here you go. -Oh, yes.

315
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,070
It's just a plain piece of wood.

316
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,470
The wooden linchpin is dragged along by the bus,

317
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,970
and shatters as it bounces on the pavement.

318
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:06,570
That is what is left of the linchpin.

319
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,470
The car which had gained speed because of the slope,

320
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:13,270
crashed into the window of the coffee shop and burst inside,

321
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,970
just as you had planned.

322
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:26,870
Mr. Aida was hit by the truck from behind and passed away.

323
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:30,470
Let's say the trick is as you say.

324
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:33,470
But, do you have proof that I did it?

325
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,170
I have proof.

326
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:38,870
Your mistake was, when you tied the piano cord on,

327
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:42,370
you hurt your finger.

328
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,970
My hand got stuck to the knob of the door of the restroom.

329
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,970
The courier truck can be operated with just one hand,

330
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,070
so you didn't leave any blood stains there.

331
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,370
But, when you went in through the toilet window,

332
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,370
you touched it and left blood stains on it.

333
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:06,970
Blood is left on the inside of the window of the toilet.

334
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,970
After returning from the restroom,

335
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,770
you continued making arrangements.

336
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,270
But since you hurt your left hand,

337
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,370
you held the pencil with your right hand.

338
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:24,270
Conan witnessed you licking your left hand occasionally.

339
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,670
Isn't that right, Conan?

340
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,670
Yes.

341
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,570
It's true that I hurt my finger.

342
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,870
But like I said, it was scraped by the door knob.

343
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,970
Can something like that be considered proof?

344
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,470
Can it, officer?

345
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,070
True.

346
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,570
-Shut up. -Yes, sir.

347
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,970
Anyway, if you insist that I'm the killer,

348
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,970
-show me concrete evidence. -Hey, what's that?

349
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:59,070
There's a glove with a strange pattern in the car.

350
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:14,070
What is the meaning of this Mr. Ohara?

351
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:17,070
If the piano cord on the bus is checked

352
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,970
your blood should also be detected on it.

353
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,870
The wound that you acquired on your hand in the toilet,

354
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:29,070
and the glove with blood stains on it is in your car.

355
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,670
The blood stain on the frame of the window of the toilet

356
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,470
shows that you held the frame from outside.

357
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:36,870
Furthermore, your blood stains are also on the piano cord

358
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,670
that is tied to the bus.

359
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,770
How are you going to explain all this?

360
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,970
How about it, Mr. Ohara?

361
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:55,070
Yes. I killed him.

362
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:03,970
That guy... Aida, he dared forget all that I did for him now,

363
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:08,870
and betrayed me by saying he was going to quit working for me.

364
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:15,370
If he quits the company, my company may go bankrupt.

365
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,370
If it were going to go bankrupt any way,

366
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,970
I figured I should kill him, making it look like an accident,

367
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:25,170
and at least get of hold of his life insurance money as compensation.

368
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,170
To tell the truth,

369
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,170
I was undecided until I began making arrangements with him

370
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,770
at the coffee shop.

371
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,070
But, he had the nerve to say,

372
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,370
he was going to take away a big job that I found,

373
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,970
as retirement pay, so...

374
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,670
What a thing to do...

375
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:45,370
I'm very sorry.

376
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:24,270
"Celebration, Renovated and reopening"

377
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,670
Thank you so much, Dr. Agasa.

378
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,870
Thanks to you, my innocence has been proven.

379
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,070
No problem, no big thing,

380
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,170
I can handle things like this hands down.

381
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:43,170
For I am the one who taught that famous high school detective,

382
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,270
Kudo the skills of being a detective, after all.

383
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,170
Oh, really?

384
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,470
Oh yeah, sure.

385
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,870
Oh well, who cares?

386
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,370
Amazing.

387
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,070
Yeah, right?

388
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,280
Next Conan's hint:

389
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,600
"Sculpture"

390
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,580
The next episode is a sonorous story.

391
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,200
I'm taking the content from the story.

392
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,720
That's good.
