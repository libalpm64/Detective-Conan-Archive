1
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:24,739
Today's code is pretty difficult.

2
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:26,339
The star and the killer are called by the same name.

3
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:28,039
Search and see through the telescope trick!

4
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:29,439
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,239
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,339
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:57,192 --> 00:02:02,392
We go over to a pension in the mountains to observe stars.

8
00:02:02,392 --> 00:02:06,192
Besides the owner of the pension, Mr. Ryoji Amatsuchi,

9
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:09,392
three people received an invitation card, Ms. Etsuko Nonomiya,

10
00:02:09,392 --> 00:02:13,392
Mr. Hajime Futagawa, and Mr. Heihachi Mikami.

11
00:02:13,392 --> 00:02:17,192
We went to look at the stars...

12
00:02:17,192 --> 00:02:18,192
When we got to a hill nearby,

13
00:02:18,192 --> 00:02:20,492
to our surprise we found a skeletonized corpse!

14
00:02:20,492 --> 00:02:22,692
Moreover, in its hand it was holding six cigarettes

15
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:24,692
thought to be a dying message.

16
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:28,192
-And, that night... -What was that sound?

17
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:30,992
Mr. Futagawa?

18
00:02:33,692 --> 00:02:36,392
The same dying message again?

19
00:02:36,392 --> 00:02:38,892
No, this time...

20
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,592
there's one more.

21
00:02:43,392 --> 00:02:48,492
"Stars, a Cigarette and a Code (Part 2)"

22
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:52,392
True.

23
00:02:52,392 --> 00:02:54,492
There are seven cigarettes in all.

24
00:02:54,492 --> 00:02:56,392
What does this mean?

25
00:02:56,392 --> 00:03:00,092
It's likely that the person that the six cigarettes stand for,

26
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:05,992
which Mr. Kono, who was killed a year ago was holding

27
00:03:05,992 --> 00:03:09,692
and the person that Mr. Futagawa is trying to describe

28
00:03:09,692 --> 00:03:12,292
using the seven cigarettes may not be the same.

29
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:15,992
Maybe the killer deliberately added one more

30
00:03:15,992 --> 00:03:18,292
just to throw investigation off.

31
00:03:18,292 --> 00:03:19,992
That's not possible.

32
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,892
We heard something drop to the ground

33
00:03:22,892 --> 00:03:25,592
and went running over right away.

34
00:03:25,592 --> 00:03:29,592
There was no light when we ran over here, was there?

35
00:03:29,592 --> 00:03:31,692
No, it was pitch dark.

36
00:03:31,692 --> 00:03:35,292
Which means that one who killed Mr. Kono,

37
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:36,892
and the one who killed Mr. Futagawa are two different people.

38
00:03:36,892 --> 00:03:40,992
Or, it could be that Mr. Futagawa tried to leave some kind of clue behind.

39
00:03:42,392 --> 00:03:44,992
There's blood on just one match.

40
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:47,392
There is blood on his hand that was holding the cigarette case.

41
00:03:50,192 --> 00:03:53,892
There's blood on the other cigarette case in his pocket too.

42
00:03:53,892 --> 00:03:56,092
It could be that...

43
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:02,992
Your detective badge is beeping.

44
00:04:05,492 --> 00:04:07,592
Oh, it's me! Can you see me?

45
00:04:07,592 --> 00:04:09,992
Above. Look up!

46
00:04:09,992 --> 00:04:11,092
Dr. Agasa!

47
00:04:13,492 --> 00:04:15,792
Hey, is anybody there?

48
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:17,193
No, no one in particular.

49
00:04:17,193 --> 00:04:19,492
We didn't see anyone, did we?

50
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,892
But, we did find something on the ground!

51
00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:23,193
Something on the ground?

52
00:04:23,193 --> 00:04:25,292
A cell phone.

53
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:27,893
There's a mail that hasn't been sent out.

54
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,593
What's written on the mail?

55
00:04:30,593 --> 00:04:31,593
"Will"

56
00:04:31,593 --> 00:04:33,193
A will.

57
00:04:33,193 --> 00:04:35,992
A will?

58
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:39,292
Mr. Futagawa is dead?

59
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:41,593
Oh no. It can't be.

60
00:04:41,593 --> 00:04:44,693
He fell off the cliff and I think he died instantly.

61
00:04:44,693 --> 00:04:49,693
Mr. Futagawa's cell phone was found on the cliff.

62
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:53,492
A mail "will" with no "send to" address was found in his cell phone.

63
00:04:53,492 --> 00:04:55,693
There was a will in his cell phone?

64
00:04:55,693 --> 00:04:57,893
This is what is written.

65
00:04:57,893 --> 00:05:00,693
I invited everyone to this pension

66
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:04,893
because I wanted to confess before everyone what I did a year ago,

67
00:05:04,893 --> 00:05:06,393
here at this pension.

68
00:05:06,393 --> 00:05:10,792
Right. The one who killed Mr. Asao Kono a year ago is I,

69
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:12,593
Hajime Futagawa

70
00:05:12,593 --> 00:05:15,492
Ms. Etsuko Nonomiya, who was his fiance,

71
00:05:15,492 --> 00:05:19,492
I am sorry to have killed someone so precious to you.

72
00:05:19,492 --> 00:05:22,992
Mr. Ryoji Amatsuchi, Mr. Kono's upper classman during his university days.

73
00:05:22,992 --> 00:05:27,992
I am sorry for throwing dirt on this pension that you manage.

74
00:05:27,992 --> 00:05:30,393
And Editor Mikami,

75
00:05:30,393 --> 00:05:34,893
please carry on with Space Sunday even after my death.

76
00:05:34,893 --> 00:05:37,893
He died because I had a slight argument with him

77
00:05:37,893 --> 00:05:40,093
on the cliff and pushed him.

78
00:05:40,093 --> 00:05:41,593
He unfortunately fell off

79
00:05:41,593 --> 00:05:45,193
I was going to confess to this truthfully

80
00:05:45,193 --> 00:05:46,893
and ask for your forgiveness.

81
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:49,492
But I found it hard to come up with the subject.

82
00:05:49,492 --> 00:05:51,193
Therefore, I have decided to make amends by killing myself

83
00:05:51,193 --> 00:05:56,193
before the police arrive here tomorrow, Hajime Futagawa.

84
00:05:56,193 --> 00:05:58,792
Then, he's dead after all, Asao's...

85
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,792
Asao's really...

86
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:05,593
I'm sorry, please accept my apologies too, as his superior.

87
00:06:05,593 --> 00:06:07,893
Don't cry, Etsuko.

88
00:06:07,893 --> 00:06:11,393
Now we know why he suddenly disappeared

89
00:06:11,393 --> 00:06:13,393
as well as found out who killed him.

90
00:06:13,393 --> 00:06:14,593
But, I wonder...

91
00:06:14,593 --> 00:06:17,093
Would a person who writes a letter then commit suicide,

92
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:19,893
leave something like this behind?

93
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:21,693
What?

94
00:06:21,693 --> 00:06:24,492
Mr. Futagawa, who fell from the cliff,

95
00:06:24,492 --> 00:06:26,593
was holding on tightly to these seven cigarettes.

96
00:06:26,593 --> 00:06:28,292
Mr. Kono had six.

97
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:31,093
Mr. Futagawa was holding one longer cigarette more.

98
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:36,292
If Mr. Futagawa killed Mr. Kono,

99
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:38,292
and if he realized that the message was about himself,

100
00:06:38,292 --> 00:06:40,193
leading him to commit suicide.

101
00:06:40,193 --> 00:06:42,893
I don't think he would increase the number of cigarettes, do you?

102
00:06:43,893 --> 00:06:47,593
On top of that, there's blood only on the one that has been increased.

103
00:06:47,593 --> 00:06:50,193
There was blood on Mr. Futagawa's hand

104
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:54,893
and the other cigarette case that was in his pocket.

105
00:06:54,893 --> 00:06:56,693
There were also traces of him having been hit

106
00:06:56,693 --> 00:06:58,792
on the head with a steel pipe too.

107
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,193
Hit?

108
00:07:00,193 --> 00:07:02,792
Yes! I think the blood got on

109
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:06,193
when he touched his bleeding head with his hands.

110
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:08,593
In other words, while the someone on the cliff,

111
00:07:08,593 --> 00:07:11,693
who hit Mr. Futagawa on the head, stole his cell phone

112
00:07:11,693 --> 00:07:13,093
and was keying in the will,

113
00:07:13,093 --> 00:07:15,393
Mr. Futagawa deliberately took out one cigarette

114
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,292
from another cigarette case that he had,

115
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:19,492
and put that extra cigarette

116
00:07:19,492 --> 00:07:21,593
into the original cigarette case with the six cigarettes inside it,

117
00:07:21,593 --> 00:07:23,992
and completed the message.

118
00:07:23,992 --> 00:07:26,893
I feel that this is indeed a dying message.

119
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:28,292
Oh no.

120
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:31,393
He probably had the cigarette case with six cigarettes in it,

121
00:07:31,393 --> 00:07:35,893
to verify whether Mr. Kono's dying message applied to him.

122
00:07:35,893 --> 00:07:37,593
Wait.

123
00:07:37,593 --> 00:07:38,693
If there were seven,

124
00:07:38,693 --> 00:07:42,693
doesn't that mean that you're the killer, Mr. Amatsuchi?

125
00:07:44,393 --> 00:07:48,492
Mr. Mikami's name Heihachi is also seven cigarettes.

126
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:55,792
Aren't your initials seven cigarettes too, Ms. Nonomiya?

127
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:58,193
Come, come, let's stay cool.

128
00:07:58,193 --> 00:08:01,693
Then all three of you, didn't see him in the forest?

129
00:08:01,693 --> 00:08:03,393
-No. -No.

130
00:08:03,393 --> 00:08:06,093
Then, let us check all your rooms.

131
00:08:07,093 --> 00:08:11,093
We don't want the one who hit Mr. Futagawa with the steel pipe,

132
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:14,593
hiding it somewhere and come after us with it, do we?

133
00:08:15,693 --> 00:08:19,393
Hey, don't mess things up too much.

134
00:08:19,393 --> 00:08:22,992
Oh, you brought a telescope with you, sir?

135
00:08:22,992 --> 00:08:25,693
Yeah. It's the one that was in the editing room.

136
00:08:25,693 --> 00:08:29,992
A lens barrel, a stand, a finder and a tripod.

137
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:34,093
The lens barrel of a telescope is not hard enough to hit someone with.

138
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:36,793
A tripod like that would probably bend

139
00:08:36,793 --> 00:08:38,492
if you hit someone with it, right?

140
00:08:38,492 --> 00:08:39,992
True.

141
00:08:39,992 --> 00:08:43,992
You tried a lot of different cigarettes too, didn't you, sir?

142
00:08:43,992 --> 00:08:44,993
Yeah.

143
00:08:44,993 --> 00:08:48,493
I couldn't figure anything out though.

144
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:51,193
Hey, that's enough!

145
00:08:51,193 --> 00:08:53,392
How long are you going to keep searching?

146
00:08:53,392 --> 00:08:54,993
The only thing that could serve as a murder weapon

147
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,793
would be this umbrella.

148
00:08:56,793 --> 00:08:59,193
But, it's not bent anywhere.

149
00:08:59,193 --> 00:09:02,993
Of course not. Because I'm not the killer.

150
00:09:02,993 --> 00:09:05,993
What about the liquor bottle you had?

151
00:09:06,993 --> 00:09:08,693
I threw it away in the forest.

152
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:11,093
When I threw you guys off.

153
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,892
Threw us off?

154
00:09:12,892 --> 00:09:14,993
You came after me, didn't you?

155
00:09:14,993 --> 00:09:18,593
You, the freckled boy and the girl with the bangs.

156
00:09:18,593 --> 00:09:20,793
I suddenly felt nauseated back then

157
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,793
and was throwing up behind a tree.

158
00:09:28,093 --> 00:09:32,793
You were trying to figure out Mr. Kono's dying message too, weren't you?

159
00:09:32,793 --> 00:09:37,392
Yes. But I didn't think they were Mr. Futagawa's initials.

160
00:09:37,392 --> 00:09:40,793
I didn't know his first name.

161
00:09:41,892 --> 00:09:45,593
Then, finally, it's your turn Mr. Amatsuchi.

162
00:09:45,593 --> 00:09:49,093
But since this pension is in its entirety like your own room,

163
00:09:49,093 --> 00:09:50,793
I guess we'll ask the police to investigate

164
00:09:50,793 --> 00:09:52,493
when we call them in the morning.

165
00:09:52,493 --> 00:09:53,693
Yes, sir.

166
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:57,693
Make sure you tell the police to search inside the forest!

167
00:09:57,693 --> 00:10:00,593
Because if I were the killer, I'd hide the murder weapon there.

168
00:10:00,593 --> 00:10:02,892
Yes.

169
00:10:02,892 --> 00:10:05,093
Ai, so how was it?

170
00:10:05,093 --> 00:10:07,793
I searched every nook and cranny of Mr. Futagawa's room

171
00:10:07,793 --> 00:10:09,593
for the thing you told me to look for

172
00:10:09,593 --> 00:10:12,892
but found nothing.

173
00:10:12,892 --> 00:10:14,392
That's strange.

174
00:10:14,392 --> 00:10:16,593
If the killer left such a will behind and killed him,

175
00:10:16,593 --> 00:10:19,593
it should be around somewhere.

176
00:10:19,593 --> 00:10:21,993
While you were investigating the rooms,

177
00:10:21,993 --> 00:10:24,793
I was here watching over the people who were waiting.

178
00:10:24,793 --> 00:10:27,493
That man called Amatsuchi is suspicious.

179
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:30,593
-He sure is suspicious. -Why?

180
00:10:30,593 --> 00:10:33,392
Because he was looking over the guest list over and over.

181
00:10:33,392 --> 00:10:35,392
Yes, really carefully, over and over.

182
00:10:35,392 --> 00:10:38,593
And with a frightening face like this.

183
00:10:38,593 --> 00:10:40,293
The guest list.

184
00:10:40,293 --> 00:10:45,493
Come to think of it, Mr. Mikami and Mr. Futagawa said that

185
00:10:45,493 --> 00:10:47,493
they met Mr. Kono only once.

186
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:49,892
After Mr. Kono's whereabouts became unknown,

187
00:10:49,892 --> 00:10:52,293
these two men have been here several times.

188
00:10:52,293 --> 00:10:53,392
Here it is.

189
00:10:53,392 --> 00:10:54,892
It's probably this day.

190
00:10:54,892 --> 00:10:57,693
The day when Mr. Kono died.

191
00:10:57,693 --> 00:11:01,793
Yes, after Mr. Kono and Ms. Nonomiya's names

192
00:11:01,793 --> 00:11:04,093
come the names of Mr. Mikami and Mr. Futagawa,

193
00:11:04,093 --> 00:11:05,593
so there's no doubt about it.

194
00:11:05,593 --> 00:11:07,093
Maybe this is...

195
00:11:10,493 --> 00:11:12,793
I see, so that's the story.

196
00:11:15,693 --> 00:11:17,993
Ai, come here a minute.

197
00:11:23,793 --> 00:11:25,593
Okay! Please.

198
00:11:26,793 --> 00:11:28,593
I agree with Ayumi too.

199
00:11:28,593 --> 00:11:29,793
Right?

200
00:11:29,793 --> 00:11:33,093
A Fusae brand wallet about this size.

201
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,593
If you get it for me, I'll help you.

202
00:11:37,892 --> 00:11:40,892
Its hurt.

203
00:11:40,892 --> 00:11:43,392
Ai! What's wrong?

204
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:46,392
-Ai, are you okay? -Ai!

205
00:11:46,392 --> 00:11:48,693
Oh no! She may have appendicitis!

206
00:11:48,693 --> 00:11:51,093
What? Does it hurt, Ai?

207
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:54,093
But, we've got a problem. The phone won't connect.

208
00:11:54,093 --> 00:11:55,892
And even if we were to carry her down,

209
00:11:55,892 --> 00:11:57,593
-who knows how long it'll take. -Ai!

210
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:59,593
It hurts, Dr. Agasa.

211
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,892
Do something, Dr. Agasa.

212
00:12:03,993 --> 00:12:07,993
Its hurt. Help.

213
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:18,392
Hello, could you send an ambulance up here?

214
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:20,693
Yes, a child suddenly fell ill.

215
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:22,392
Just as I thought.

216
00:12:31,037 --> 00:12:33,737
Hello, please send an ambulance up here.

217
00:12:33,737 --> 00:12:34,937
-Yes, a child suddenly fell ill. -No joke.

218
00:12:34,937 --> 00:12:38,337
I thought the modular cable for the phone was gone?

219
00:12:38,337 --> 00:12:40,737
The address is Gunma prefecture...

220
00:12:46,537 --> 00:12:47,537
Conan?

221
00:12:47,537 --> 00:12:49,837
We have to contact the ambulance quickly or Ai will...

222
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:51,637
Just what do you think you're doing?

223
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:54,537
There's no need to call one I was just acting.

224
00:12:54,537 --> 00:13:00,037
In order to reveal the one who hid the modular cable

225
00:13:00,037 --> 00:13:04,737
and flattened the tires of our cars to confine us here.

226
00:13:04,737 --> 00:13:08,037
Don't tell me that the one who used Asao's name

227
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,137
and sent out the invitation card to gather us here was...

228
00:13:10,137 --> 00:13:11,937
You.

229
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:15,237
You're the one who left a will in Mr. Futagawa's cell phone,

230
00:13:15,237 --> 00:13:16,737
made it look like he committed suicide

231
00:13:16,737 --> 00:13:18,937
and pushed him off the cliff,

232
00:13:18,937 --> 00:13:22,137
Mr. Ryoji Amatsuchi!

233
00:13:22,137 --> 00:13:23,137
Oh, no...

234
00:13:29,937 --> 00:13:31,137
Wrong.

235
00:13:32,737 --> 00:13:33,937
Wrong?

236
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:37,337
It's true that Mr. Amatsuchi is the one who invited everyone here

237
00:13:37,337 --> 00:13:38,937
and confined us here.

238
00:13:38,937 --> 00:13:40,637
But, he's not the killer.

239
00:13:40,637 --> 00:13:42,637
Why not, Conan?

240
00:13:42,637 --> 00:13:46,337
It was in the will that the killer wrote, wasn't it?

241
00:13:46,337 --> 00:13:48,937
That the killer's the one who invited everyone here.

242
00:13:48,937 --> 00:13:52,537
If Mr. Amatsuchi was the one who killed Mr. Futagawa,

243
00:13:52,537 --> 00:13:54,837
wouldn't he have made it look like...

244
00:13:54,837 --> 00:13:58,237
Mr. Futagawa was the one who confined everyone here?

245
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:02,837
And he would've hidden that modular cable into Mr. Futagawa's clothes,

246
00:14:02,837 --> 00:14:04,337
or hidden it in the room.

247
00:14:04,337 --> 00:14:06,037
True.

248
00:14:06,037 --> 00:14:09,037
Mr. Amatsuchi called everyone here

249
00:14:09,037 --> 00:14:11,237
because he found the bones,

250
00:14:11,237 --> 00:14:14,137
the ring and dying message cigarettes of Mr. Kono,

251
00:14:14,137 --> 00:14:17,537
whose whereabouts became unknown a year ago.

252
00:14:17,537 --> 00:14:20,637
If not, he couldn't have been so accurate

253
00:14:20,637 --> 00:14:22,137
just taking a quick glance at the cigarettes

254
00:14:22,137 --> 00:14:23,737
and remarking that there were four long cigarettes

255
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,737
and two short ones, right?

256
00:14:25,737 --> 00:14:28,337
Yeah. I sent out the invitation

257
00:14:28,337 --> 00:14:30,337
to the people who spent the night here that day

258
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:32,437
because I found those things.

259
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:34,237
I figured that if the killer found out

260
00:14:34,237 --> 00:14:35,937
that I found the bones and the message,

261
00:14:35,937 --> 00:14:38,937
the killer would confess.

262
00:14:38,937 --> 00:14:41,437
But, since Mr. Futagawa died,

263
00:14:41,437 --> 00:14:42,837
I couldn't come out and say so.

264
00:14:42,837 --> 00:14:46,337
Which means then that the person who killed Mr. Futagawa is...

265
00:14:46,337 --> 00:14:50,737
Of course! The killer is that woman called Ms. Nonomiya, right?

266
00:14:50,737 --> 00:14:53,137
What a thing to say?

267
00:14:53,137 --> 00:14:54,837
That is possible.

268
00:14:54,837 --> 00:14:59,037
If she realized that the cigarettes stood for Mr. Futagawa's initials.

269
00:14:59,037 --> 00:15:02,237
Avenging the death of her fiance that was killed.

270
00:15:02,237 --> 00:15:04,137
That's more than enough motive.

271
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:09,637
No, Ms. Nonomiya said she passed us in the forest.

272
00:15:09,637 --> 00:15:12,937
She couldn't possibly have gone up the hill before us,

273
00:15:12,937 --> 00:15:14,437
meet Mr. Futagawa and push him off the cliff.

274
00:15:14,437 --> 00:15:18,137
But when Mr. Futagawa fell off,

275
00:15:18,137 --> 00:15:20,137
all three of you ran right over, didn't you?

276
00:15:20,137 --> 00:15:23,037
If somebody was watching that from on top of the cliff...

277
00:15:23,037 --> 00:15:25,137
Seen from on top the cliff

278
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:28,137
were only three little lights the size of a bean.

279
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:32,237
It's impossible to make out who the three of us were from that distance.

280
00:15:32,237 --> 00:15:34,937
In other words, by means of elimination

281
00:15:34,937 --> 00:15:37,237
the only one capable of being the killer is,

282
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,437
Mr. Futagawa's boss and editor,

283
00:15:39,437 --> 00:15:42,237
Mr. Heihachi Mikami, you are the killer, right?

284
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:50,537
If the other two aren't the killer, you say that it's me?

285
00:15:52,337 --> 00:15:56,337
But, Mr. Futagawa was holding seven cigarettes.

286
00:15:56,337 --> 00:15:59,837
That was a message pointing out your name, Heihachi.

287
00:15:59,837 --> 00:16:01,337
It's only a coincidence.

288
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:05,337
And, besides, why do I have to go and kill Futagawa?

289
00:16:05,337 --> 00:16:10,037
If he did kill the guy called Kono a year ago, then the more so.

290
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:12,037
I have no obligation to avenge the death

291
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:14,537
of a person that I've met for the first time.

292
00:16:14,537 --> 00:16:15,837
True.

293
00:16:15,837 --> 00:16:20,337
But that's only if Mr. Futagawa had actually killed Mr. Kono.

294
00:16:20,337 --> 00:16:21,637
What?

295
00:16:21,637 --> 00:16:25,237
I looked through the guest book

296
00:16:25,237 --> 00:16:29,337
and noticed that Mr. Mikami's name was listed after Mr. Kono's name.

297
00:16:29,337 --> 00:16:31,337
It dawned on me that maybe Mr. Kono knew Mr. Mikami's name

298
00:16:31,337 --> 00:16:34,437
only by sound and not the kanji character.

299
00:16:34,437 --> 00:16:35,937
By sound?

300
00:16:35,937 --> 00:16:38,437
The kanji for the word "mi" in Mr. Mikami's name

301
00:16:38,437 --> 00:16:40,937
is also pronounced as "o", right?

302
00:16:40,937 --> 00:16:42,337
Yes, the usual kanji character for "Mikami"

303
00:16:42,337 --> 00:16:43,837
is made out of the word three (San) and top (Ue).

304
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,737
The number of strokes for the kanji character are...

305
00:16:45,737 --> 00:16:47,937
One, two, three...

306
00:16:47,937 --> 00:16:50,137
-Six! -Six!

307
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:53,737
Right, the six cigarettes left behind by Mr. Kono

308
00:16:53,737 --> 00:16:57,137
as well as the seven cigarettes left behind by Mr. Futagawa

309
00:16:57,137 --> 00:17:01,837
are both dying messages that stand for Heihachi Mikami!

310
00:17:01,837 --> 00:17:04,137
Mr. Futagawa increased the number of cigarettes

311
00:17:04,137 --> 00:17:06,037
to make it easier to understand.

312
00:17:06,037 --> 00:17:07,637
He chose the same brand of cigarette

313
00:17:07,637 --> 00:17:11,137
because the killer for both incidents was the same person.

314
00:17:11,137 --> 00:17:12,937
Come to think of it,

315
00:17:12,937 --> 00:17:18,137
Mr. Futagawa was laughing while looking at the guest book back then.

316
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:21,537
That's when he realized that Mr. Mikami killed Mr. Kono.

317
00:17:21,537 --> 00:17:23,537
So, when he tried to confirm it,

318
00:17:23,537 --> 00:17:26,937
he was probably killed instead, no?

319
00:17:26,937 --> 00:17:30,137
This is ridiculous. Do you have any evidence?

320
00:17:30,137 --> 00:17:34,737
The evidence is the bag that was found in your room.

321
00:17:34,737 --> 00:17:40,237
If something like the steel pipe that killed Mr. Futagawa is found,

322
00:17:40,237 --> 00:17:43,237
it will serve as concrete evidence!

323
00:17:43,237 --> 00:17:45,237
Hey.

324
00:17:45,237 --> 00:17:48,337
You checked that bag a while ago.

325
00:17:48,337 --> 00:17:51,137
Yeah. I couldn't find the steel pipe,

326
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,037
but I couldn't find something that should've been there either.

327
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:54,337
Something that should've been there?

328
00:17:54,337 --> 00:17:57,137
The heavy-weight for the telescope.

329
00:17:57,137 --> 00:18:00,537
You put something else into this lens barrel

330
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,937
and removed the heavy-weight.

331
00:18:02,937 --> 00:18:05,637
In order to keep the weight what is should be.

332
00:18:05,637 --> 00:18:08,637
So, will you show us the inside of the lens barrel?

333
00:18:08,637 --> 00:18:11,237
No matter how well you wipe it,

334
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:13,237
the luminol reaction from the blood that stuck to it

335
00:18:13,237 --> 00:18:16,037
after you hit Mr. Futagawa is bound to be there.

336
00:18:16,037 --> 00:18:20,037
Futagawa's blood is definitely still here.

337
00:18:20,037 --> 00:18:21,937
So, you're the one after all.

338
00:18:21,937 --> 00:18:24,537
Right. I went out of my way to look after him

339
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,137
and see that he made it to the desk,

340
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:28,237
yet he had the nerve to say to pay him 50,000,000 yen

341
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:31,037
if I wanted him to keep his mouth shut about the murder.

342
00:18:31,037 --> 00:18:34,637
All I did was punish Kono for not being grateful.

343
00:18:34,637 --> 00:18:35,937
Punished him?

344
00:18:35,937 --> 00:18:38,137
Just what do you mean?

345
00:18:38,137 --> 00:18:40,337
A comet.

346
00:18:42,537 --> 00:18:46,937
A year ago, that day, the guy named Kono came to ask me a favor.

347
00:18:46,937 --> 00:18:52,237
He asked me to verify whether the comet he found was a new one or not.

348
00:18:52,237 --> 00:18:55,737
You mean the comet that was named after you?

349
00:18:55,737 --> 00:19:00,837
It was found by that man and I confirmed it on that cliff.

350
00:19:00,837 --> 00:19:02,637
Don't tell me that you killed Asao

351
00:19:02,637 --> 00:19:04,637
so that you could hog that comet all for yourself?

352
00:19:04,637 --> 00:19:08,537
I asked him to put my name on the comet, of course.

353
00:19:08,537 --> 00:19:10,337
But that guy...

354
00:19:10,337 --> 00:19:11,737
Talk about ungrateful.

355
00:19:13,037 --> 00:19:15,237
No, I can't.

356
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,737
We've already decided that the name of the star is...

357
00:19:18,737 --> 00:19:19,937
Amatsuchi, Nonomiya, Kono comet.

358
00:19:21,437 --> 00:19:23,237
I thought...

359
00:19:23,237 --> 00:19:24,537
Come to think of it,

360
00:19:24,537 --> 00:19:28,037
he mentioned that the time's finally come.

361
00:19:28,037 --> 00:19:31,437
I thought that he found somebody else.

362
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:35,537
It was a dream I've held since childhood too.

363
00:19:35,537 --> 00:19:39,337
And yet he refused to listen to me.

364
00:19:39,337 --> 00:19:41,737
So, I figured that I'd go and submit it before he does

365
00:19:41,737 --> 00:19:43,737
and headed back for the pension.

366
00:19:43,737 --> 00:19:47,037
Then, that guy came clinging onto me so I brushed him away

367
00:19:47,037 --> 00:19:49,537
and he fell off the cliff.

368
00:19:49,537 --> 00:19:53,037
Then, later when you came here again

369
00:19:53,037 --> 00:19:54,337
in order to hasten skeletonizing of the corpse,

370
00:19:54,337 --> 00:19:56,037
you poured lime over it, right?

371
00:19:56,037 --> 00:19:57,037
Right.

372
00:19:57,037 --> 00:19:58,837
What a surprise it was to find that

373
00:19:58,837 --> 00:20:02,437
Mr. Amatsuchi was the sender of the invitations.

374
00:20:02,437 --> 00:20:05,237
I thought it was Futagawa all this time.

375
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,437
Hey, hurry and take out the steel pipe.

376
00:20:07,437 --> 00:20:08,837
Stop pushing me.

377
00:20:08,837 --> 00:20:11,137
It's a steel pipe...

378
00:20:12,137 --> 00:20:14,837
but, not an ordinary steel pipe.

379
00:20:14,837 --> 00:20:17,237
Shot gun.

380
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:20,337
Okay! You line up there too!

381
00:20:21,737 --> 00:20:26,437
In Futagawa's case, I just hit him to avoid the gun shot,

382
00:20:26,437 --> 00:20:29,637
but this time I'll finish you all off in a blow.

383
00:20:29,637 --> 00:20:31,537
I'll sure need a lot of lime.

384
00:20:34,237 --> 00:20:36,337
No need to be scared little lady.

385
00:20:36,337 --> 00:20:40,337
I'll turn you into a star in no time.

386
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:41,837
What are you doing brat?

387
00:20:41,837 --> 00:20:44,137
Can't you see? I'm wearing my shoes.

388
00:20:44,137 --> 00:20:45,937
Shoes?

389
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:49,037
You idiot! Do you think you can get away?

390
00:20:49,037 --> 00:20:51,337
No. Mine's the same as yours.

391
00:20:51,337 --> 00:20:53,037
What?

392
00:20:53,037 --> 00:20:56,037
Mine is also...

393
00:20:57,537 --> 00:20:58,837
not an ordinary shoe.

394
00:21:02,337 --> 00:21:03,437
See.

395
00:21:13,737 --> 00:21:15,737
Aren't you glad

396
00:21:15,737 --> 00:21:19,437
now that your name will finally be branded

397
00:21:19,437 --> 00:21:22,937
as one owned by a criminal, a convict, rather than comet?

398
00:22:54,137 --> 00:22:58,637
I wonder why Mr. Kono was so obsessed about the name of the comet?

399
00:22:58,637 --> 00:23:01,337
I can understand him wanting to name it after his fiance, Ms. Nonomiya,

400
00:23:01,337 --> 00:23:04,537
but why couldn't he let Mr. Amatsuchi wait and name it after Mr. Mikami?

401
00:23:04,537 --> 00:23:05,637
Then, this wouldn't have happened.

402
00:23:05,637 --> 00:23:09,237
But, they were upper classman and under classman at the university.

403
00:23:09,237 --> 00:23:12,037
-They were probably very good friends! -Guess so.

404
00:23:12,037 --> 00:23:14,237
I don't think that's all there is to it.

405
00:23:14,237 --> 00:23:16,637
He really didn't want to leave out Mr. Amatsuchi

406
00:23:16,637 --> 00:23:18,937
because "Ama" from Amatsuchi's name, "No" from Nonomiya's name,

407
00:23:18,937 --> 00:23:21,037
and "Kawa" from his name, when you them line up horizontally

408
00:23:21,037 --> 00:23:22,837
stands for Amanogawa, which means the Milky Way.

409
00:23:22,837 --> 00:23:24,337
-I understand. -I see.

410
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:26,837
Conan, you're fantastic!

411
00:23:26,837 --> 00:23:29,937
Hey, will you guys be a little quieter?

412
00:23:29,937 --> 00:23:31,937
I was going to go to the country over to grandma's place

413
00:23:31,937 --> 00:23:35,237
and I get dispatched so early in the morning like this.

414
00:23:35,237 --> 00:23:37,137
I guess it'll be a while till I get to go again.

415
00:23:37,137 --> 00:23:39,837
I'm so sleepy...

416
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:41,537
Where?

417
00:23:41,537 --> 00:23:43,137
Where did you call just now?

418
00:23:43,137 --> 00:23:45,437
Grandma's place in Tottori.

419
00:23:45,437 --> 00:23:47,937
Tottori?

420
00:24:31,764 --> 00:24:34,964
Next Conan's Hint:

421
00:24:34,964 --> 00:24:36,164
"Tent"

422
00:24:36,164 --> 00:24:37,864
It's time limit for Saturday's homework.

423
00:24:37,864 --> 00:24:39,164
Hey, it's already Monday night.

424
00:24:39,164 --> 00:24:41,068
-I've got to watch Detective Conan. -It just ended.
