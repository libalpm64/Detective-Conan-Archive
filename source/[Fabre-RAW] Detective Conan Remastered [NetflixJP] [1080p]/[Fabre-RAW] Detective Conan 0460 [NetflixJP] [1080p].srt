I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:06,191 --> 00:00:07,691
The whereabouts of Ms. Kobayashi is not known?

4
00:00:07,691 --> 00:00:10,091
1st grade class B, let's all go to do a grand search!

5
00:00:10,091 --> 00:00:11,391
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,391 --> 00:00:13,091
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:15,291
His name is Detective Conan!

00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:06,081
It's started to really rain hard after all.

10
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:08,381
Bummers, rain.

11
00:02:08,381 --> 00:02:11,781
We were supposed to play dodge ball fifth period.

12
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:13,881
But I guess it's cancelled.

13
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:17,381
No way! And I was looking forward to playing!

14
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:20,481
Then what're we going to do on the fifth period?

15
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:22,081
Beats me.

16
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:25,581
We already finished funfest last week.

17
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:27,881
Then, maybe it'll be reading time?

18
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,681
That's boring.

00:02:36,981 --> 00:02:38,981
Okay.

21
00:02:38,981 --> 00:02:40,181
Done.

22
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,881
Perfect!

00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:57,081
Do you all have a pencil with you?

26
00:02:57,081 --> 00:03:00,281
Make sure you write kanji in the correct order!

27
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:01,681
Geez.

28
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,981
Honestly, give me a break.

29
00:03:05,281 --> 00:03:08,181
No, Conan.

30
00:03:08,181 --> 00:03:09,681
Listen, Conan.

31
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:11,481
The order in which to write the kanji character woman is

32
00:03:11,481 --> 00:03:16,281
first write the shape "ku" then "no" and finally "ichi"!

33
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:17,481
Yeah...

34
00:03:17,481 --> 00:03:19,181
Oh, no!

35
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:21,381
I forgot to bring my eraser!

36
00:03:24,081 --> 00:03:25,181
Here.

37
00:03:26,781 --> 00:03:28,581
Use mine.

Thank you, Ai.

00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:33,681
Use mine. She says.

41
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,881
I'm sorry!

42
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:38,481
Haibara, you're gonna get it.

43
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:40,581
Oh? Is something wrong, Conan?

44
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:44,081
Ms. Kobayashi!

45
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:45,381
Yes?

46
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:48,581
There's a student that's not writing anything at all!

47
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:50,681
What's the matter, Sakamoto?

48
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:52,381
Do you feel sick or something?

49
00:03:52,381 --> 00:03:53,681
No.

50
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:56,181
The tips of all my pencils broke off.

51
00:03:56,181 --> 00:03:58,581
So I can't write even if I want to.

52
00:03:58,581 --> 00:04:01,581
Didn't you bring a pencil sharpener with you?

53
00:04:01,581 --> 00:04:03,181
I forgot.

54
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:06,181
Then why don't you borrow one from somebody.

55
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:08,081
Somebody, who?

56
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,181
-What? -Come, now.

00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:11,481
Here you go!

58
00:04:11,481 --> 00:04:13,881
I'll lend you my pencil.

00:04:13,881 --> 00:04:14,981
Thank you.

60
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:18,081
From next time if you are in a fix, let's not worry on our own,

61
00:04:18,081 --> 00:04:20,081
and discuss the problem with everybody, okay?

62
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:21,181
Yes.

63
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:25,181
-Oh, my. -All right!

00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,581
Next is the long awaited lunch time!

65
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:31,681
You're always so energetic when it comes to lunchtime, Genta.

66
00:04:31,681 --> 00:04:33,081
Oh, everybody.

67
00:04:33,081 --> 00:04:34,781
What? There's no lunch?

68
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:35,781
Genta.

69
00:04:35,781 --> 00:04:40,381
Please leave the classroom open at recess after lunchtime.

70
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:41,881
In the meantime,

71
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:45,481
I will have to meet someone here.

72
00:04:45,481 --> 00:04:48,081
We can't stay in the classroom, no matter what?

73
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:50,081
I'm so sorry.

74
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,181
That person is very shy so...

75
00:04:53,181 --> 00:04:54,881
Okay, lunchtime.

76
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:56,081
Yes...

77
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:58,581
"Library" -I wonder what it is.

78
00:04:58,581 --> 00:05:00,981
Ms. Kobayashi's wink.

79
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:03,681
She's surely hiding something.

80
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:09,081
What's this?

81
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:12,081
That's our classroom, isn't it?

82
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:14,381
I wonder what's come up.

83
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,081
Did something happen?

84
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:17,281
Bad news!

85
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:19,681
Ms. Kobayashi...

86
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:23,981
"I will be taking care of Ms. Kobayashi."

87
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:25,581
"Can you figure out where she is?"

88
00:05:25,581 --> 00:05:28,081
"From the fiend with 200 faces."

89
00:05:28,081 --> 00:05:29,681
The fiend...

90
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:31,681
With 200 faces?

91
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:34,881
I see.

92
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:37,181
So this was the reason for her wink.

93
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:41,381
Cute, isn't she?

94
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:43,481
I tell you that Rampo freak.

95
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:44,781
Then,

96
00:05:44,781 --> 00:05:47,381
does that means the person Ms. Kobayashi was seeing during recess was...

97
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:49,381
The fiend?

98
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:52,381
I'll go report this to the principle...

99
00:05:52,381 --> 00:05:54,481
Hold it!

100
00:05:54,481 --> 00:05:57,481
I found this piece of paper in my desk.

101
00:05:57,481 --> 00:05:59,381
Is it from the fiend?

102
00:05:59,381 --> 00:06:04,981
No. I think this is a deduction game that Ms. Kobayashi set us up with.

103
00:06:04,981 --> 00:06:06,981
Deduction game?

104
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:11,281
In other words, she's going to drop us hints

105
00:06:11,281 --> 00:06:14,481
so that we can figure out where she's hiding.

106
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:18,781
Since she sent us out of this classroom during recess,

107
00:06:18,781 --> 00:06:21,681
maybe she still has some clue hidden here somewhere.

108
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:22,981
-Let's look for it. -Let's look for it.

109
00:06:22,981 --> 00:06:23,981
Let's go!

110
00:06:25,781 --> 00:06:28,181
I found one in my desk too!

111
00:06:28,181 --> 00:06:29,781
Paper number two.

112
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:31,781
Mine is paper number one.

113
00:06:31,781 --> 00:06:34,281
I have number five!

114
00:06:34,281 --> 00:06:35,681
Number three.

115
00:06:35,681 --> 00:06:36,981
Number two.

116
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:38,481
Number one.

117
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,281
Number five.

118
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:41,981
Number four is missing.

119
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:45,481
Then, it should be somewhere in the classroom too, right?

120
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:47,981
Okay. Let's all look for it, then!

121
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:49,181
-Yeah. -Yeah.

122
00:06:49,181 --> 00:06:53,981
I found this paper in my desk too.

123
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,681
All right! It's number four!

124
00:06:56,681 --> 00:06:58,381
Now we've got all the cards!

125
00:06:58,381 --> 00:07:00,881
Hey, wait a second.

126
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:03,081
Who are you anyway?

127
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:04,581
How rude, Genta.

128
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:07,881
She's Maria Higashio who transferred to our school the other day.

129
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:09,981
Maria Higashio?

130
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:13,081
That's right, Genta. Don't tell me you don't remember.

131
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:15,081
My god.

132
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:18,181
Well, I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't remember.

133
00:07:18,181 --> 00:07:19,181
What?

134
00:07:19,181 --> 00:07:22,181
Because he was absent from school with a cold

135
00:07:22,181 --> 00:07:24,381
when she first came to our school.

136
00:07:25,481 --> 00:07:27,781
Oh, I see, no wonder.

137
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,881
Anyway, let's organize the hints that we've gathered.

138
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:32,581
Okay.

139
00:07:32,581 --> 00:07:35,581
The card with number one on it

140
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:38,181
was in Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya's, that is my desk.

141
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:40,581
Number two was in Ayumi Yoshida's desk.

142
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:43,181
Conan Edogawa had number three.

143
00:07:43,181 --> 00:07:45,581
Maria Higashio had number four.

144
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:48,081
And Genta Kojima had number five.

145
00:07:49,181 --> 00:07:52,481
I wonder why only Genta's number is written in red.

146
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:55,781
Have you had nose bleeds recently?

147
00:07:55,781 --> 00:07:57,781
No, I didn't have any!

148
00:07:57,781 --> 00:08:02,681
Maybe it's in order of grades?

149
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:05,781
See, in Japan, report cards are graded by

150
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:07,381
using the numbers one to five, right?

151
00:08:07,381 --> 00:08:09,481
For example, if the grades of the five people here

152
00:08:09,481 --> 00:08:13,081
matches the grades for... let's say art,

153
00:08:13,081 --> 00:08:15,881
then maybe Ms. Kobayashi is in the art room.

154
00:08:15,881 --> 00:08:18,981
One to five grading method?

155
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:22,281
The number two is about me?

156
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:25,881
The first graders at Teitan Elementary are evaluated only by two words,

157
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,581
"good" and "a bit more".

158
00:08:27,581 --> 00:08:30,081
Oh, is that how?

159
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:31,481
I heard that when my big sister was going to school

160
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:33,781
they were graded on a five number evaluation method.

161
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:36,981
I guess I misunderstood it a bit.

162
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:38,581
If I remember correctly,

163
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:40,681
it seems to have been that way some time ago, but...

164
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:43,681
How many years apart are you from your big sister, Haibara?

165
00:08:43,681 --> 00:08:46,681
Haibara, do you have a big sister?

166
00:08:46,681 --> 00:08:49,981
Oh, maybe it was mum that said that.

167
00:08:49,981 --> 00:08:54,881
Hey. It seems that the hint is not limited to just the five numbers.

168
00:08:56,681 --> 00:09:00,181
See. In the back of the paper that was posted on the blackboard.

169
00:09:03,381 --> 00:09:04,981
-Dice? -Dice?

170
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:07,781
316. (Pronounced as mi-i-mu)

171
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,281
245. (Pronounced as ni-shi-go)

172
00:09:09,281 --> 00:09:10,781
316. (Pronounced as sa-hi-ro)

173
00:09:10,781 --> 00:09:13,181
245. (Pronounced as fu-yo-go)

174
00:09:13,181 --> 00:09:16,181
I don't think it has to do with a play on words.

175
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:19,981
But I wonder what these six numbers on the dice are?

176
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:22,581
We only found five numbers

177
00:09:22,581 --> 00:09:24,781
so they seem to have no connection.

178
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:27,381
No, they are very deeply connected.

179
00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:30,381
There should still be a number six

180
00:09:30,381 --> 00:09:33,581
hidden somewhere in this classroom.

181
00:09:33,581 --> 00:09:35,481
The number six?

182
00:09:35,481 --> 00:09:37,681
There was none in my desk.

183
00:09:37,681 --> 00:09:39,481
None in mine either.

184
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:40,581
Me neither.

185
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:41,981
Same here.

186
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,981
Then, where is number six?

187
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:49,281
It was inside.

188
00:09:49,281 --> 00:09:51,381
If it's this meaningless paper you're talking about.

189
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:54,281
Come on! Why didn't you hurry up and tell us?

190
00:09:54,281 --> 00:09:56,481
It's up to me what I want to do, isn't it?

191
00:09:56,481 --> 00:10:01,281
What? Come to think of it, you don't look all that familiar either.

192
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:02,381
Who is he?

193
00:10:02,381 --> 00:10:05,281
Come on, Genta! Have you forgotten?

194
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:07,481
He was badly hurt right after we entered 1st grade,

195
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:10,181
and started coming to school finally since October.

196
00:10:10,181 --> 00:10:11,581
His name is Sakamoto...

197
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:14,681
What? What was your first name?

198
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:19,681
Surely it was Sakamoto...

199
00:10:19,681 --> 00:10:21,781
Takuma!

200
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:25,681
Your full name's Takuma Sakamoto, right?

201
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:26,681
Yes.

202
00:10:26,681 --> 00:10:28,181
Is that it?

203
00:10:28,181 --> 00:10:30,181
Just as expected of you, Conan!

204
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:31,781
You remembered?

205
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:36,081
No, I hate to say this but I forgot too.

206
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:38,581
How'd you figure out his name, then?

207
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:41,181
Thanks to Ms. Kobayashi's code.

208
00:10:41,181 --> 00:10:45,981
I deciphered her code and came up with the name "Takuma".

209
00:10:45,981 --> 00:10:47,181
What? Then...

210
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:50,081
Did you figure out where Ms. Kobayashi is hiding?

211
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:52,181
Yeah, of course.

212
00:10:52,181 --> 00:10:54,881
-Where? Tell me, Conan! -Where? Where is she?

213
00:10:54,881 --> 00:10:56,981
Yes. Out with it without keeping us in suspense.

214
00:10:56,981 --> 00:10:58,981
Darn it, Haibara!

215
00:10:58,981 --> 00:11:02,881
First of all, as to why your number 5 is red, Genta...

216
00:11:02,881 --> 00:11:06,381
1st grader, Conan Edogawa of class B.

217
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:08,981
Please come to the teacher's room immediately.

218
00:11:08,981 --> 00:11:11,381
-I repeat! 1st grader, -You're being paged, Conan.

219
00:11:11,381 --> 00:11:13,281
-Conan Edogawa of class B. -I guess.

220
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:16,081
Come immediately.

221
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:18,681
Looks like I have to go.

222
00:11:18,681 --> 00:11:20,681
-What? -Hey, Conan.

223
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:24,181
Go if you have to but tell us the answer of the code before going!

224
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:25,481
Don't worry.

225
00:11:25,481 --> 00:11:27,581
You guys can figure it out right away!

226
00:11:27,581 --> 00:11:31,881
It's a simple game that every kid knows.

227
00:11:31,881 --> 00:11:33,981
Bye then. I'm counting on "you're" guys!

228
00:11:33,981 --> 00:11:35,781
"You're" guys? Come on!

229
00:11:35,781 --> 00:11:37,181
-Hey! -Conan!

230
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:42,281
"You're"? "Yon (means four)- roku (means six) - shiku".

231
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:48,581
So, that's what it means.

232
00:11:53,678 --> 00:11:58,678
Hey. Do we have to solve Ms. Kobayashi's code without Conan?

233
00:11:58,678 --> 00:12:01,878
You think we should wait until Conan comes back.

234
00:12:01,878 --> 00:12:03,378
Oh come on.

235
00:12:03,378 --> 00:12:04,578
If he can solve it,

236
00:12:04,578 --> 00:12:07,978
there's no reason why we can't, don't you think so?

237
00:12:09,378 --> 00:12:11,478
But, you see...

238
00:12:11,478 --> 00:12:14,278
Besides, this is a code that an elementary school teacher

239
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:17,378
made for the students of her class.

240
00:12:17,378 --> 00:12:21,078
It's not a mysterious dying message left

241
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:23,178
after a murder case or a code for a treasure map

242
00:12:23,178 --> 00:12:27,078
so I'm sure it's made so that we can solve it on our own.

243
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:31,278
There's no reason why we should back off even before trying, is there?

244
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:32,778
Right.

245
00:12:32,778 --> 00:12:35,078
I'm starting to feel like we can solve it!

246
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:37,178
-Let's give it our best shot! -Then, let's start

247
00:12:37,178 --> 00:12:39,278
by attaching the name of the person

248
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:42,978
that had numbered cards in their desk to the number on the dice.

249
00:12:42,978 --> 00:12:47,478
First, it's three, so Conan.

250
00:12:47,478 --> 00:12:51,378
Next it's one, so Mitsuhiko, then six is Takuma!

251
00:12:51,378 --> 00:12:53,378
Two is Ayumi.

252
00:12:53,378 --> 00:12:56,678
Four is Maria and five is me!

253
00:12:56,678 --> 00:13:01,878
Conan, Mitsuhiko, Takuma, Ayumi, Maria and Genta.

254
00:13:01,878 --> 00:13:03,878
If we take only the first vowel sound of our names,

255
00:13:03,878 --> 00:13:07,078
it comes out to CO-MI-TA-A-MA-GE.

256
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,978
"Comita amage"?

257
00:13:08,978 --> 00:13:10,078
If it's our last names,

258
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:12,678
it would be Edogawa, Tsuburaya, Sakamoto,

259
00:13:12,678 --> 00:13:15,478
Yoshida, Higashio, Kojima.

260
00:13:15,478 --> 00:13:19,478
It'll be "E-Tsu-Sa-Yo-Hi-Ko".

261
00:13:21,578 --> 00:13:23,178
Maybe the numbers that were in our desks

262
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:26,578
and this dice are completely different things.

263
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:31,178
The fact that only Genta's five was written in red bothers me too.

264
00:13:33,178 --> 00:13:34,778
What's the matter, Ai?

265
00:13:34,778 --> 00:13:36,878
Did you figure something out?

266
00:13:36,878 --> 00:13:38,178
Oh, look.

267
00:13:38,178 --> 00:13:43,278
One thing that is red among six,

268
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:45,878
I think there was something like that.

269
00:13:45,878 --> 00:13:49,378
One thing that is red among six?

270
00:13:49,378 --> 00:13:52,378
As for traffic lights, it's only one out of three.

271
00:13:52,378 --> 00:13:56,778
As for playing cards, it's 26 out of 52.

272
00:13:56,778 --> 00:13:59,278
Well...

273
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:00,978
That...

274
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:04,678
I get it!

275
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,278
Dice, right?

276
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,378
Incredible, Maria, you did great to figure it out!

277
00:14:09,378 --> 00:14:13,878
Yes! I love playing "sugoroku" (children's dice game)!

278
00:14:13,878 --> 00:14:14,878
You have a Kansai dialect.

279
00:14:14,878 --> 00:14:16,578
You love "sugoroku"?

280
00:14:16,578 --> 00:14:18,478
There's no need to be ashamed.

281
00:14:18,478 --> 00:14:21,178
Dialects are like accessories to words.

282
00:14:21,178 --> 00:14:23,078
If you want to talk without it, it's okay,

283
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:24,878
but you shouldn't get rid of it.

284
00:14:24,878 --> 00:14:29,678
Because it carries an important message

285
00:14:29,678 --> 00:14:32,278
of the district you were born.

286
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:34,478
Yes! That's right!

287
00:14:34,478 --> 00:14:40,378
What does my number being red have anything to do with the dice?

288
00:14:40,378 --> 00:14:42,878
In a dice, the only red number is one, right?

289
00:14:42,878 --> 00:14:44,078
In other words,

290
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:46,478
it means that aside from the five that was in your desk,

291
00:14:46,478 --> 00:14:49,678
one holds meaning!

292
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:54,278
If it means that I'm number one of all six of us...

293
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:57,778
The only thing thinkable is your height or weight.

294
00:14:57,778 --> 00:14:59,478
But when we measured height and weight the other day,

295
00:14:59,478 --> 00:15:03,978
Ayumi and I were just about the same height and weight.

296
00:15:03,978 --> 00:15:08,078
Besides, kids this age seem to grow at a fast rate on a daily basis,

297
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:09,978
so I guess it's not this.

298
00:15:09,978 --> 00:15:11,578
Incidentally.

299
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:16,678
Takuma, are there any games or sports you're good at?

300
00:15:16,678 --> 00:15:17,978
Why?

301
00:15:17,978 --> 00:15:20,978
Remember Conan saying?

302
00:15:20,978 --> 00:15:25,178
That the hint was a game that every kid knows.

303
00:15:25,178 --> 00:15:29,878
So I thought maybe it's in order of who's good at some game or sports!

304
00:15:29,878 --> 00:15:32,478
Genta is number one, so...

305
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:34,978
Okay, it's baseball!

306
00:15:34,978 --> 00:15:37,578
I can play baseball too.

307
00:15:37,578 --> 00:15:40,278
Because I used to play ball with dad a lot.

308
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:42,678
Then, are you better than me?

309
00:15:42,678 --> 00:15:44,478
Hold it.

310
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:47,178
I mean you're not professional baseball players or anything,

311
00:15:47,178 --> 00:15:49,678
but just 1st graders who are good at sports.

312
00:15:49,678 --> 00:15:50,778
Something like that is too hard to determine,

313
00:15:50,778 --> 00:15:52,978
that it's not something that can be lined out in order, is it?

314
00:15:52,978 --> 00:15:54,678
I guess so.

315
00:15:54,678 --> 00:15:58,478
There must be something else, another game that will serve as a hint.

316
00:16:01,578 --> 00:16:04,678
"1-B" -Ms. Kobayashi, right?

317
00:16:04,678 --> 00:16:07,878
You've been here eavesdropping on everybody's conversation, weren't you?

318
00:16:07,878 --> 00:16:11,578
Since I was easily able to solve your code,

319
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:13,578
you used your cell phone

320
00:16:13,578 --> 00:16:16,778
and asked another teacher to suddenly page me, right?

321
00:16:16,778 --> 00:16:18,278
I couldn't help it, could I?

322
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:21,178
Having you solve it too easily is no fun!

323
00:16:21,178 --> 00:16:24,778
It's not only because it's no fun, is it?

324
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:27,378
You precocious brat.

325
00:16:27,378 --> 00:16:30,378
But it's going to work out.

326
00:16:30,378 --> 00:16:32,778
-Hide-and-seek. -TV game!

327
00:16:32,778 --> 00:16:35,078
Playing house!

328
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,278
None of them sound right.

329
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:39,878
I'm good at musical chair!

330
00:16:39,878 --> 00:16:42,378
It's because you have a big rear end, Genta.

331
00:16:42,378 --> 00:16:44,678
Musical chair. Rear end.

332
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:49,178
Doesn't anything cross your mind, Ai?

333
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:50,778
Well.

334
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:55,178
Maybe it's not a physical game.

335
00:16:55,178 --> 00:16:57,578
Yes. For example...

336
00:16:57,578 --> 00:16:58,778
Word chain game!

337
00:17:00,178 --> 00:17:03,378
The names of all six of us match the word chain game.

338
00:17:03,378 --> 00:17:05,678
Word chain game?

339
00:17:05,678 --> 00:17:06,978
True!

340
00:17:06,978 --> 00:17:09,878
Genta, Takuma, Maria,

341
00:17:09,878 --> 00:17:12,878
Ayumi, Mitsuhiko, Conan.

342
00:17:12,878 --> 00:17:16,878
Really! You've gotta find the right word and Genta is the first one!

343
00:17:16,878 --> 00:17:19,578
It's amazing you figured it out!

344
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:21,078
It was just by chance.

345
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:26,378
I see. Ms. Kobayashi is hiding in that classroom.

346
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:30,378
But, Mitsuhiko. So what if it's a word chain game?

347
00:17:30,378 --> 00:17:34,678
So, match the order of the names to the number on the dice,

348
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:38,578
and then line out the numbers that were in the desk of the six of us.

349
00:17:38,578 --> 00:17:42,178
The third name in line is Maria, so it's four!

350
00:17:42,178 --> 00:17:44,578
First is Genta so it's five.

351
00:17:44,578 --> 00:17:46,778
Sixth is Conan and it's three.

352
00:17:46,778 --> 00:17:48,878
Second is Takuma so it's six.

353
00:17:48,878 --> 00:17:50,678
Fourth is Ayumi, so it's two.

354
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:53,078
Fifth is me and it's one.

355
00:17:53,078 --> 00:17:54,878
If we read this in order it goes.

356
00:17:54,878 --> 00:18:00,478
Four, five, three, six, two, one.

357
00:18:00,478 --> 00:18:03,078
Yo-ko-sa-mu-ni-i?

358
00:18:03,078 --> 00:18:05,378
It's mumbo-jumbo, isn't it?

359
00:18:05,378 --> 00:18:08,478
Maybe it's not the word chain game?

360
00:18:08,478 --> 00:18:09,978
It has to be!

361
00:18:09,978 --> 00:18:13,478
Because the word chain fits in too well to be a coincidence!

362
00:18:13,478 --> 00:18:17,578
Come to think of it, Conan was saying that when he deciphered the code,

363
00:18:17,578 --> 00:18:20,978
he figured out that Sakamoto's first name was Takuma, right?

364
00:18:20,978 --> 00:18:25,378
Yes. If the game is making a word chain,

365
00:18:25,378 --> 00:18:30,178
the only name that can come between Genta and Maria is Takuma.

366
00:18:30,178 --> 00:18:33,578
But, there's a person called "Tajima" living in the neighborhood!

367
00:18:33,578 --> 00:18:35,378
There's a guy called "Tanuma" too!

368
00:18:35,378 --> 00:18:38,078
But, they're both last names, aren't they?

369
00:18:39,878 --> 00:18:45,178
I think Conan figured out the "ku" part of Takuma's name.

370
00:18:45,178 --> 00:18:46,578
-That's it! Right! -That's true!

371
00:18:46,578 --> 00:18:47,978
Is something the matter?

372
00:18:47,978 --> 00:18:50,678
Takuma's last name is Sakamoto.

373
00:18:50,678 --> 00:18:52,678
The sound "ku" in his name is the sixth letter

374
00:18:52,678 --> 00:18:54,278
from the top if written in hiragana.

375
00:18:54,278 --> 00:18:56,978
Everybody's saying that it matches the number six

376
00:18:56,978 --> 00:18:59,878
that was found in Takuma's desk!

377
00:18:59,878 --> 00:19:01,578
I see!

378
00:19:01,578 --> 00:19:04,078
"Tsuburaya" -So, my name is Tsuburaya and I found number one,

379
00:19:04,078 --> 00:19:05,378
so the first letter is "tsu" in hiragana.

380
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:09,278
So, I'm Genta Kojima and found number five,

381
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:10,578
"Genta" -so the hiragana "ge" of my name is to be used?

382
00:19:10,578 --> 00:19:12,078
You mean "n".

383
00:19:12,078 --> 00:19:14,278
"Yoshida" -I'm Yoshida and found number two,

384
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,578
so the hiragana "shi" of my name is to be used!

385
00:19:15,578 --> 00:19:19,278
"Higashio" -My name's Higashio and I found number four, it's "o".

386
00:19:19,278 --> 00:19:22,778
"Edogawa" -Edogawa is number three, so the hiragana used is "ga".

387
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:24,978
So, shall we read the letters just now

388
00:19:24,978 --> 00:19:27,578
in the order of the numbers on the dice that we saw a while ago?

389
00:19:27,578 --> 00:19:31,578
The first "three" on the dice is me, so...

390
00:19:31,578 --> 00:19:33,378
"O"!

391
00:19:33,378 --> 00:19:35,378
Next is Kojima so...

392
00:19:35,378 --> 00:19:36,878
"N"!

393
00:19:36,878 --> 00:19:38,478
What about Edogawa that comes next?

394
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:39,478
"Ga"!

395
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,178
Next, Sakamoto.

396
00:19:41,178 --> 00:19:42,778
"Ku"!

397
00:19:42,778 --> 00:19:43,878
Yoshida.

398
00:19:43,878 --> 00:19:45,078
"Shi"!

399
00:19:45,078 --> 00:19:46,778
Then, Tsuburaya!

400
00:19:46,778 --> 00:19:48,378
"Tsu"!

401
00:19:48,378 --> 00:19:50,978
The music classroom (ongakushitsu)!

402
00:19:53,278 --> 00:19:56,678
I'm kind of starting to understand how tough things are for Kudo.

403
00:19:56,678 --> 00:19:59,778
Let's all head on over to the music room then!

404
00:19:59,778 --> 00:20:01,078
-Yeah! -Yeah!

405
00:20:01,078 --> 00:20:03,678
Let's go, Maria!

406
00:20:08,878 --> 00:20:11,278
Hey! You're coming too!

407
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:12,578
If the answer's not correct,

408
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:16,478
we've got to think it over again together.

409
00:20:16,478 --> 00:20:17,778
I know.

410
00:20:17,778 --> 00:20:19,778
"Music room"

411
00:20:21,478 --> 00:20:24,578
Is Ms. Kobayashi there?

412
00:20:26,178 --> 00:20:28,078
No.

413
00:20:28,078 --> 00:20:30,078
Nobody seems to be here.

414
00:20:30,078 --> 00:20:32,078
No joke!

415
00:20:32,078 --> 00:20:36,778
Don't tell me that something was wrong in the way we solved the code.

416
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:40,278
Maybe it's the dice that I mentioned.

417
00:20:40,278 --> 00:20:44,178
I think it's the word chain that was wrong.

418
00:20:44,178 --> 00:20:46,378
It can't be!

419
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:50,078
Look really good before complaining.

420
00:20:50,078 --> 00:20:52,578
I'm sure she's here somewhere!

421
00:20:52,578 --> 00:20:56,178
I mean, you're stretching it out too far.

422
00:21:01,978 --> 00:21:04,978
Ms. Kobayashi!

423
00:21:04,978 --> 00:21:08,078
Which means that our deduction was...

424
00:21:08,078 --> 00:21:10,378
Yes, of course!

425
00:21:10,378 --> 00:21:11,978
You hit the bull's eye!

426
00:21:16,578 --> 00:21:18,078
You'd better be grateful!

427
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:19,478
I had a hard time.

428
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,078
Sorry.

429
00:21:21,078 --> 00:21:24,078
Okay then, Ms. Kobayashi. Give us a reward.

430
00:21:24,078 --> 00:21:25,978
I have no such thing for you!

431
00:21:25,978 --> 00:21:27,978
You mean we don't get anything?

432
00:21:27,978 --> 00:21:31,678
I lose, you guys are fantastic.

433
00:21:31,678 --> 00:21:34,478
Will this do?

434
00:21:34,478 --> 00:21:36,778
No way...

435
00:21:36,778 --> 00:21:40,778
No, you win, Ms. Kobayashi.

436
00:21:40,778 --> 00:21:44,478
A girl who was flustered by the change in environment

437
00:21:44,478 --> 00:21:47,478
because she just transferred to this school.

438
00:21:47,478 --> 00:21:50,378
And a boy who was absent for a long period of time from school

439
00:21:50,378 --> 00:21:52,978
because of a wound and couldn't quite fit into class.

440
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,478
You put their names into the code

441
00:21:55,478 --> 00:21:57,578
and helped everyone remember their names.

442
00:21:57,578 --> 00:21:59,278
You set it up so that, like it or not,

443
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:02,178
they had to participate in solving the code too.

444
00:22:02,178 --> 00:22:03,678
And you perfectly helped the two melt in

445
00:22:03,678 --> 00:22:06,178
and get along with the others in class.

446
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,378
Hey, then!

447
00:23:34,378 --> 00:23:35,478
For our next extra curricular activity,

448
00:23:35,478 --> 00:23:38,978
why don't we go explore the mysterious western style building on Nichome?

449
00:23:38,978 --> 00:23:42,578
You mean the "Etou" house, right next door to Dr. Agasa's?

450
00:23:42,578 --> 00:23:45,078
Rumor has it that it's vacant again

451
00:23:45,078 --> 00:23:47,978
and that there's an evil spirit living there!

452
00:23:47,978 --> 00:23:51,178
Come on, hey. That's my house!

453
00:23:51,178 --> 00:23:52,978
Oh? That sure sounds interesting!

454
00:23:52,978 --> 00:23:55,978
Yes! Exploration of the mysterious western style house in Nichome!

455
00:23:55,978 --> 00:23:57,978
"Etou..."

456
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,078
It's read "Kudo".

457
00:24:46,878 --> 00:24:48,678
Next Conan's Hint:

458
00:24:48,678 --> 00:24:51,078
"Photo frame"

459
00:24:51,078 --> 00:24:52,778
Next Episode is Kanto Railway.

460
00:24:52,778 --> 00:24:54,378
Where has that train run off to?

461
00:24:54,378 --> 00:24:55,878
I can't break it to you.
