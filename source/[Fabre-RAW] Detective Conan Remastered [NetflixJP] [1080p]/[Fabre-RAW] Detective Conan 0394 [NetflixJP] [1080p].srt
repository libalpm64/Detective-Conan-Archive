1
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:06,419
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:08,219
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:08,219 --> 00:00:11,519
The Youth Detective Squad goes through great adventure

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,519
at an eccentric mansion of tricks. Off we go after the treasure!

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,019
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:16,919
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:16,919 --> 00:00:19,119
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:03,472
Mountains are for men.

9
00:02:12,672 --> 00:02:16,272
Genta, come on and get to work.

10
00:02:17,672 --> 00:02:20,572
Please help us collect firewood!

11
00:02:20,572 --> 00:02:22,672
Huh? I'm not slacking off!

12
00:02:22,672 --> 00:02:24,772
I already have a lot.

13
00:02:24,772 --> 00:02:25,772
Look.

14
00:02:27,872 --> 00:02:30,172
That's far from enough, Genta!

15
00:02:31,172 --> 00:02:33,472
I see.

16
00:02:33,472 --> 00:02:35,672
But why isn't Conan here?

17
00:02:37,572 --> 00:02:38,572
Not again.

18
00:02:38,572 --> 00:02:41,672
Like I told you just a while ago.

19
00:02:49,372 --> 00:02:50,972
Did you catch a cold?

20
00:02:50,972 --> 00:02:52,172
No.

21
00:02:53,372 --> 00:02:55,072
Shinichi.

22
00:02:55,072 --> 00:02:57,472
What were we talking about?

23
00:02:58,972 --> 00:03:01,072
I shouldn't have asked him.

24
00:03:01,072 --> 00:03:02,572
A song? The "Seven Baby Crows".

25
00:03:02,572 --> 00:03:04,472
The "Seven Baby Crows", right?

26
00:03:04,472 --> 00:03:05,572
Yes, I know the song.

27
00:03:07,272 --> 00:03:12,672
"Crow, oh crow, why do you cry..."

28
00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:14,272
That's the song, right?

29
00:03:14,272 --> 00:03:16,472
Yes, that's the one.

30
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:19,672
I used to sing it a lot on my way home from school.

31
00:03:20,772 --> 00:03:21,772
And? What about it?

32
00:03:21,772 --> 00:03:23,372
Is it your music homework or something?

33
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:25,472
No!

34
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:28,172
Remember the number I mentioned the other day?

35
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:30,872
When I use my cell phone and hit the buttons rhythmically,

36
00:03:30,872 --> 00:03:33,272
it sounds like the beginning part of that song, right?

37
00:03:33,272 --> 00:03:34,872
0858.

38
00:03:34,872 --> 00:03:36,872
"Crow, oh crow..."

39
00:03:36,872 --> 00:03:39,272
Let me see.

40
00:03:46,072 --> 00:03:47,872
True.

41
00:03:47,872 --> 00:03:50,172
It finally came back to me.

42
00:03:51,472 --> 00:03:55,472
Back then, when Bellmot was sending mail to the boss,

43
00:03:55,472 --> 00:03:59,972
I felt somewhat sad and nostalgic.

44
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:01,772
But it wasn't the expression on her face that made me feel that way.

45
00:04:01,772 --> 00:04:04,972
It was the sound of the buttons she was pushing.

46
00:04:04,972 --> 00:04:09,272
What? Then are you saying that the mail address of their boss

47
00:04:09,272 --> 00:04:10,572
is the "Seven Baby Crows"?

48
00:04:15,072 --> 00:04:17,272
It can't be.

49
00:04:17,272 --> 00:04:20,272
Why would the boss use a children's song for his mail address?

50
00:04:20,272 --> 00:04:24,872
What if they remembered the address by the melody?

51
00:04:24,872 --> 00:04:26,872
By the melody?

52
00:04:26,872 --> 00:04:27,972
Yes.

53
00:04:27,972 --> 00:04:32,872
Then they wouldn't have to register the mail address inside their phone.

54
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,972
Which makes it safe for a variety of reasons, right?

55
00:04:34,972 --> 00:04:40,772
0858 may sound like "Crow, oh crow", but...

56
00:04:42,572 --> 00:04:46,272
"Why do you cry" is not so easy.

57
00:04:47,472 --> 00:04:50,972
Well, it's true that it's not all that accurate,

58
00:04:50,972 --> 00:04:53,872
but if we make do with the slight difference in sound...

59
00:04:55,172 --> 00:04:56,572
and put it together.

60
00:04:58,472 --> 00:05:00,772
It comes out like this.

61
00:05:00,772 --> 00:05:04,972
This is the mail address of the boss of the Black Organization.

62
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,672
What?

63
00:05:08,672 --> 00:05:11,072
I quite sure it is.

64
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:15,772
Hey, don't tell me you sent mail there?

65
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:20,172
Why would I do something so stupid as to let them know where we are?

66
00:05:20,172 --> 00:05:21,372
I guess so.

67
00:05:21,372 --> 00:05:22,972
You scared me out of my wits.

68
00:05:24,172 --> 00:05:25,872
Well, if I'm going to send mail out,

69
00:05:25,872 --> 00:05:28,672
it'll be after I tell Officer Takagi of the circumstances.

70
00:05:28,672 --> 00:05:30,072
They'll annihilate him.

71
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,272
Officer Takagi.

72
00:05:33,272 --> 00:05:36,172
At the point that he tries to specify who the boss is,

73
00:05:36,172 --> 00:05:38,672
they'll kill him with their very hands.

74
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,272
Then, their target will turn to the one who provided the mail address,

75
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:43,972
that is you, Kudo.

76
00:05:43,972 --> 00:05:46,672
Not only Officer Takagi,

77
00:05:46,672 --> 00:05:47,872
but the police should also be notified

78
00:05:47,872 --> 00:05:49,272
after we explain the situation to them.

79
00:05:49,272 --> 00:05:51,972
We should face the organization prepared.

80
00:05:51,972 --> 00:05:53,272
Impossible.

81
00:05:53,272 --> 00:05:55,772
If right after that incident, maybe,

82
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,572
but now that it's been closed as a mere kidnap case.

83
00:05:59,572 --> 00:06:02,172
Aside from Officer Takagi who might believe a story like that,

84
00:06:02,172 --> 00:06:05,572
it's unthinkable that anyone else will.

85
00:06:05,572 --> 00:06:08,272
Yes. In order to get the police to make a move,

86
00:06:08,272 --> 00:06:13,172
we needed that mail address at that time.

87
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:17,972
I mean somebody unthinkable may emerge after all, you know.

88
00:06:17,972 --> 00:06:20,172
Someone unthinkable?

89
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,472
Don't tell me...

90
00:06:21,472 --> 00:06:23,472
You know who it is?

91
00:06:23,472 --> 00:06:28,472
Don't tell me you know their mail address or who the boss is?

92
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,472
I wonder?

93
00:06:32,472 --> 00:06:35,072
But what a waste that we can't do a thing about it,

94
00:06:35,072 --> 00:06:40,472
despite having found the boss' mail address.

95
00:06:40,472 --> 00:06:43,172
Well, it's best you give up

96
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:44,372
and forget about it.

97
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:50,172
You should never open that mail address.

98
00:06:52,272 --> 00:06:53,872
It's Pandora's Box.

99
00:06:57,372 --> 00:07:03,072
"Adventure at an Eccentric Mansion - Lock In"

100
00:07:04,672 --> 00:07:06,172
What did you just say?

101
00:07:07,472 --> 00:07:09,572
What's this? What's this about a panda's box?

102
00:07:09,572 --> 00:07:11,272
Tell us, Conan.

103
00:07:11,272 --> 00:07:13,172
Treasure?

104
00:07:13,172 --> 00:07:16,872
Don't tell me there's a panda inside?

105
00:07:16,872 --> 00:07:19,372
No, Ayumi.

106
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:23,172
It is a story in Greek mythology,

107
00:07:23,172 --> 00:07:25,272
in which God gives a box filled with evils and disasters that exist,

108
00:07:25,272 --> 00:07:28,172
to a woman called Pandora,

109
00:07:28,172 --> 00:07:31,172
and tells her never to open it.

110
00:07:31,172 --> 00:07:33,472
But the more somebody tells you not to open something,

111
00:07:33,472 --> 00:07:36,272
the more it makes you want to open it, right?

112
00:07:36,272 --> 00:07:38,172
Come on, Genta.

113
00:07:38,172 --> 00:07:39,272
Right.

114
00:07:39,272 --> 00:07:42,472
Pandora went against God's words and opened the box,

115
00:07:42,472 --> 00:07:46,472
which brought about evil and disaster into this world.

116
00:07:46,472 --> 00:07:47,972
That's how the story went, right?

117
00:07:47,972 --> 00:07:49,472
Yes.

118
00:07:49,472 --> 00:07:52,372
And what about that panda's box?

119
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,372
-Right, right! -Right, right!

120
00:07:54,672 --> 00:07:56,672
It's nothing.

121
00:07:58,772 --> 00:08:01,072
Talking about box, while we were picking up firewood,

122
00:08:01,072 --> 00:08:03,772
we found a strange looking stone box.

123
00:08:03,772 --> 00:08:04,872
Yes!

124
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:07,172
A stone box?

125
00:08:07,172 --> 00:08:08,872
What is that?

126
00:08:08,872 --> 00:08:14,072
Yes. A stone that looks like an old box with a hole in two places.

127
00:08:14,072 --> 00:08:17,872
When we looked inside through the hole, it was full of words.

128
00:08:19,172 --> 00:08:23,572
Something about a God's stone this and that was what written inside.

129
00:08:23,572 --> 00:08:25,472
There were many difficult kanji characters written inside.

130
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,972
-So we couldn't read it. -Exactly.

131
00:08:27,972 --> 00:08:29,172
Hey.

132
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:32,172
Will you take me to where you found that stone box?

133
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,672
Yes.

134
00:08:38,772 --> 00:08:42,072
This way. This way. It's this way.

135
00:08:46,972 --> 00:08:48,672
This way. This way.

136
00:08:48,672 --> 00:08:50,572
It's this way.

137
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:53,072
You don't need to run.

138
00:08:53,072 --> 00:08:54,972
Hey!

139
00:08:54,972 --> 00:08:56,772
That's right.

140
00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:02,872
How far did you guys go pick up firewood anyway?

141
00:09:04,672 --> 00:09:06,472
See, over there.

142
00:09:06,472 --> 00:09:07,472
Right!

143
00:09:17,572 --> 00:09:21,372
I didn't know there was such a mansion in a place like this.

144
00:09:21,372 --> 00:09:23,472
After taking another good look at it...

145
00:09:23,472 --> 00:09:25,372
It sure is beat up.

146
00:09:27,272 --> 00:09:28,672
Oh, my.

147
00:09:28,672 --> 00:09:32,172
This is really a dilapidated building.

148
00:09:39,772 --> 00:09:42,072
It kind of looks creepy.

149
00:09:42,072 --> 00:09:44,372
You can say that again.

150
00:09:44,372 --> 00:09:48,972
It seems to have been left unused for quite a number of years.

151
00:09:54,672 --> 00:09:55,972
This place is...

152
00:09:57,672 --> 00:10:00,172
Conan!

153
00:10:00,172 --> 00:10:02,072
Over here! This way!

154
00:10:16,772 --> 00:10:20,772
This is the stone box that you've been wanting to see, Conan.

155
00:10:20,772 --> 00:10:26,572
We were looking into this swamp and found this box sunk at the bottom...

156
00:10:28,272 --> 00:10:31,072
and a carp was lost inside it!

157
00:10:31,072 --> 00:10:35,472
We tried to catch the carp and pulled the box up,

158
00:10:35,472 --> 00:10:38,072
and noticed the words inside it.

159
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:40,972
The carp got away though.

160
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:46,372
Isn't this a stone garden lantern?

161
00:10:46,372 --> 00:10:48,872
What? Stone garden lantern?

162
00:10:50,672 --> 00:10:53,172
The kind you see a lot in Japanese gardens.

163
00:10:53,172 --> 00:10:56,672
A lantern made of stone, you know.

164
00:10:58,372 --> 00:11:03,072
This is probably the fire pouch in the middle where you place the candle.

165
00:11:04,172 --> 00:11:07,372
Now that you mentioned it, it does look that way.

166
00:11:07,372 --> 00:11:08,472
But if it is really so,

167
00:11:08,472 --> 00:11:11,672
the covering and the base should also be on the ground somewhere.

168
00:11:13,772 --> 00:11:15,772
It is on the ground.

169
00:11:15,772 --> 00:11:17,472
Inside the swamp.

170
00:11:17,472 --> 00:11:20,272
And it's not like just one or two.

171
00:11:24,072 --> 00:11:25,272
True!

172
00:11:25,272 --> 00:11:28,572
We were so absorbed in the carp a while ago that we didn't notice it.

173
00:11:29,572 --> 00:11:33,372
They probably sank all the stone garden lanterns they had in the yard

174
00:11:33,372 --> 00:11:36,072
into the swamp.

175
00:11:36,072 --> 00:11:37,572
To make it look as if

176
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,172
there were no stone garden lanterns here...

177
00:11:41,972 --> 00:11:44,072
to begin with.

178
00:11:47,472 --> 00:11:50,172
They didn't want anyone other than themselves

179
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:53,672
to decipher the code that they found

180
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:56,372
and take away the treasure.

181
00:11:58,072 --> 00:12:00,672
Treasure...

182
00:12:02,672 --> 00:12:04,672
Are you serious?

183
00:12:04,672 --> 00:12:07,472
Yes, most likely.

184
00:12:15,472 --> 00:12:18,172
No, that's not all.

185
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:20,172
It seems that the stone garden lanterns

186
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,472
were not only sunk into the swamp to hide the code.

187
00:12:24,372 --> 00:12:25,972
What do you mean?

188
00:12:37,072 --> 00:12:40,572
It seems it was done to hide a crime, too!

189
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:33,050
The temperature of this swamp is approximately 20 degrees centigrade.

190
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:38,250
Despite this, decay gas is not accumulated in the body yet.

191
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,950
Which means it hasn't been too long since the victim's been killed.

192
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:48,350
From the traces of strangulation left on the neck,

193
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,550
he was probably choked to death then sunk into the swamp.

194
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,050
The stone garden lanterns were probably stacked up one on top the other

195
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,050
so that his body wouldn't come floating up.

196
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,450
Who could've done this?

197
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,850
Beats me.

198
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,750
I'm sure it has something to do with treasure though.

199
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,350
Mr. Teruhisa Tamai, age 42.

200
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,850
How about it? Anything?

201
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:13,950
No.

202
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:17,550
It's just a driver's license, nothing else.

203
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,750
There's something's inside.

204
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,450
Hey. Is that the treasure?

205
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:26,850
No.

206
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,450
This is...

207
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,250
a comma-shaped bead made of stone.

208
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,250
The word fire is carved on it.

209
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,950
Don't tell me that that's the treasure?

210
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:42,350
What's this? It's just a strangely shaped stone.

211
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,550
Hey!

212
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,550
A person is dead here.

213
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,450
How can you go on and on talking about treasure?

214
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:52,150
Doc, will you call the police?

215
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,250
Oh, that's right.

216
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,850
I guess I can't call from here.

217
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,550
The cell phone won't connect from here

218
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:14,850
so I'll go back to the tent and call from there.

219
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,150
Thanks!

220
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,150
Be careful.

221
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,850
So since the sun is starting to set,

222
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,650
let's all head back to the tent, too.

223
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,950
Hey, Conan. You mean we're leaving just like that?

224
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:31,550
Exactly! The treasure is right before our eyes, you know?

225
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,850
-That's right! -Yes!

226
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,850
Idiot!

227
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,950
The one who killed this man

228
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,750
could still be hiding somewhere around here yet.

229
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,850
You guys! Do you want to be attacked wandering around here or what?

230
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,250
But...

231
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,850
Listen.

232
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,750
And besides, we only found out what this man's name is,

233
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,350
we don't know anything else, you know?

234
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,250
He seems to be a treasure hunter.

235
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:02,850
His notebook is filled with information and maps of treasures

236
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,150
that are scattered all over Japan.

237
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,650
-Really? -Yes.

238
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:13,450
The process of his treasure hunt this time is written in detail, too.

239
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,850
"I've been able to team up with a partner that's pretty good.

240
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:24,050
So now I can outfox that petty thief that puts on airs."

241
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,650
Petty thief that puts on airs?

242
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:37,850
"I've been burned by that magician, time and again."

243
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,750
The resting place of the God Nioh is near the sun,

244
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:58,050
in an extremely busy location where the elders get together.

245
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,850
That is where the God Nioh stone is.

246
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:04,350
Those who do not fear the rage of the God Nioh,

247
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,550
get a hold of the stones that are brimming out of its hand

248
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,850
and learn from the proverb of long ago.

249
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:14,350
Kichiemon Samizu.

250
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,450
Samizu?

251
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,750
Kichiemon Samizu.

252
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,450
is the one who lived during the closing years of the Tokugawa Shogunate.

253
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,850
He's the puppet maker who financially supported

254
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,850
the samurai who backed up the Shogun.

255
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,650
What a fantastic puppet!

256
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:37,450
This puppet brings you tea, right?

257
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,350
That's not all.

258
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,550
When you finish drinking tea,

259
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,950
it takes the tea cup back to where it came from, too.

260
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,750
I bet a remote controller or something is used!

261
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,650
No, it doesn't need that.

262
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,550
It moves on its own.

263
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:57,550
Then how does it run, Ayumi?

264
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,850
I really don't know, but...

265
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,450
They say the inside consist only of springs and gears.

266
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,350
There are various other dolls,

267
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:10,750
and there seem to be dolls that remain even now, made by word-of-mouth.

268
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,950
You sure are smart.

269
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,850
I saw a program about it on TV just the other day.

270
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:21,450
At any rate, the dolls made by Kichiemon

271
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,650
were reputed and favoured among the merchants as looking to be alive.

272
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,350
Therefore, he made a fortune in a single generation.

273
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:30,250
People called him "Puppet Maker Kichiemon".

274
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,850
Does that mean the doll of the God of Strength made by Kichiemon

275
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:37,950
is somewhere in this house?

276
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,650
Doll of the God of Strength?

277
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:52,350
No. Even if it were to be here, 140 years have passed.

278
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:55,250
Hidden in a dilapidated place like this,

279
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,550
I'm sure it would be all had it by now.

280
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,950
Oh, so it's all beat up.

281
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:05,450
The treasure is the stone of the God.

282
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:11,850
The resting place of the God Nioh is near the sun,

283
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:16,850
in an extremely busy location where the elders get together.

284
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,550
That is where the God Nioh stone is.

285
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,650
And that's what's written.

286
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,150
So what does that mean?

287
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:28,650
Right. What is the meaning of the letters that are carved on that stone?

288
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,350
It's too difficult and hard to understand.

289
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,350
To make it simple,

290
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,350
it says that the stone of the God Nioh can be found

291
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:41,650
in a place nearest to the sun where the God Nioh sleep.

292
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,450
That is a very busy place where the elders get together.

293
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,950
What is that stone of the God Nioh?

294
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,950
It's not just any other stone, is it?

295
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:57,050
The God of Strength owns a very hard stone.

296
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:00,050
A very hard stone...

297
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,850
In other words,

298
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,850
the King of Stones.

299
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,250
A diamond.

300
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,450
Diamond...

301
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,350
Yes, diamonds are said to have been brought into Japan

302
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:18,250
at the period towards the end of the Shogunate government,

303
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,150
so the time is just about right.

304
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,050
Come to think of it, during that TV program,

305
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:30,650
it said that they found an odd map in Kichiemon's storeroom.

306
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:34,550
The man probably saw the map on a recent TV program,

307
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,550
searched for this mansion,

308
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:39,450
and found the stone lanterns here.

309
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,250
And the partner that he believed in

310
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,250
and thought would be useful ended up killing him.

311
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,450
That's most likely what happened.

312
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,750
Wait.

313
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,250
There's something more written here.

314
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,550
What comes after that is the problem.

315
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:05,550
Those who do not fear the rage of the God Nioh.

316
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,950
It's there after all.

317
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:12,250
And get a hold of the stones that are brimming out of its hand.

318
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,550
Their hands brimming with stones?

319
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,250
Hey, Conan.

320
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,050
What is it? Tell us what follows.

321
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:29,050
Their hands brimming with...

322
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,650
The Big Jewel!

323
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,250
No doubt about it.

324
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,650
Hey, hey.

325
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,250
Let's leave Conan behind and go look for the treasure ourselves.

326
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,250
I guess so.

327
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,650
Let's go look for the treasure ourselves.

328
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:54,350
What? But without Conan we can't decipher the code.

329
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,650
Don't worry.

330
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:00,150
I think the key to the ignition has already been turned.

331
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,550
This is interesting.

332
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,350
A mansion of tricks.

333
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,050
Great.

334
00:24:31,877 --> 00:24:33,977
Next Conan's Hint:

335
00:24:33,977 --> 00:24:36,277
"Three types of sacred treasures"

336
00:24:36,277 --> 00:24:38,277
Next week, he'll be appearing after a long time!

337
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:39,377
-Who's he? -Who's that?

338
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:40,677
His rival.
