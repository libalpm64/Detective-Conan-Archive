1
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:07,039
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:08,839
They can be the culprit or the actor.

3
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:10,539
The Osaka duo watch a magic show.

4
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:14,039
Off stage, however, a life-taking trap is set up.

5
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:15,539
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:17,439
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:19,839
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,124 --> 00:02:02,024
Yes, so we're gonna go and see that with these people right now.

9
00:02:02,024 --> 00:02:04,324
Oh, that sounds amazing!

10
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,524
Okay, to go to that hall,

11
00:02:05,524 --> 00:02:08,124
you need to go straight down this street and then...

12
00:02:09,424 --> 00:02:13,024
Why...

13
00:02:13,024 --> 00:02:15,924
Man, it's stressing me out.

14
00:02:22,524 --> 00:02:24,624
Guess who I am?

15
00:02:25,624 --> 00:02:27,724
-Hey! Stop it! -It's me!

16
00:02:27,724 --> 00:02:29,924
Stop it! I'm serious! Kudo!

17
00:02:31,424 --> 00:02:33,024
So you know, Ran.

18
00:02:34,024 --> 00:02:35,824
Hey, Hattori!

19
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:40,824
You want me to do the Judo throw on you?

20
00:02:40,824 --> 00:02:42,224
Heiji?

21
00:02:43,824 --> 00:02:45,124
Well...

22
00:02:47,124 --> 00:02:49,324
Hey, Hattori.

23
00:02:51,324 --> 00:02:57,224
"Conan and Heiji's Deduction Magic (Tricks)"

24
00:02:57,624 --> 00:03:00,424
I'm so sorry, Ran! For asking you a big favor.

25
00:03:01,124 --> 00:03:04,324
Hattori, what brings you here?

26
00:03:04,324 --> 00:03:08,624
Is it the Dogo Hoshikawa's Super Magic Show?

27
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:13,024
She said "I feel like watching miracles".

28
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:18,624
So I had to come for this stupid girl's stupid tricks.

29
00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:20,724
Don't call me stupid, stupid!

30
00:03:20,724 --> 00:03:21,724
Huh?

31
00:03:22,424 --> 00:03:25,524
Kazuha, they are over there.

32
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:28,824
Now, let's go! Conan.

33
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:44,224
"Dogo Hoshikawa's Illusion Magic Show"

34
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:49,624
Hey, it's here. Hurry up, Ran!

35
00:03:49,624 --> 00:03:53,324
There are a lot of young people here, don't you think?

36
00:03:53,324 --> 00:03:55,124
Are there?

37
00:03:57,224 --> 00:04:00,024
I see, so he is Dogo Hoshikawa.

38
00:04:00,024 --> 00:04:03,624
That's right! Don't you think he is handsome, Ran?

39
00:04:03,624 --> 00:04:07,824
He's not just a handsome guy but also a great magician!

40
00:04:20,424 --> 00:04:25,324
"Illusion Magic Show"

41
00:04:30,924 --> 00:04:32,524
She's a hot girl, huh?

42
00:04:32,524 --> 00:04:33,724
Yes.

43
00:06:10,524 --> 00:06:13,624
What? I thought he was hanging on strings.

44
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:15,624
That's what I thought too.

45
00:06:51,224 --> 00:06:52,524
It's amazing.

46
00:06:52,524 --> 00:06:54,024
Is it?

47
00:08:35,824 --> 00:08:36,924
No way.

48
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:38,424
He vanished.

49
00:08:50,724 --> 00:08:51,924
It's unbelievable.

50
00:08:51,924 --> 00:08:53,924
He must be a wizard.

51
00:08:53,924 --> 00:08:55,324
Are you stupid?

52
00:08:56,024 --> 00:08:59,024
There's no such thing called a wizard.

53
00:08:59,024 --> 00:09:01,024
I think so too.

54
00:09:01,024 --> 00:09:02,324
That cage looks impossible to escape from,

55
00:09:02,324 --> 00:09:04,324
but it actually has a door in the back.

56
00:09:04,324 --> 00:09:08,224
So, after the cloth covers the cage, he goes out through the backdoor.

57
00:09:08,224 --> 00:09:10,924
We didn't see him anywhere on the stage though!

58
00:09:10,924 --> 00:09:14,524
The girl assistants on the stage are the key to the trick.

59
00:09:14,524 --> 00:09:16,924
Inside the cage, that magician probably changed his clothes

60
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:20,724
to the ones that the girls are wearing in order to camouflage himself.

61
00:09:22,924 --> 00:09:26,224
Nobody was counting how many assistants were on the stage,

62
00:09:26,224 --> 00:09:29,724
so we wouldn't know whether it was eight or nine assistants, right?

63
00:09:29,724 --> 00:09:31,824
By walking closely with the female assistants,

64
00:09:31,824 --> 00:09:32,824
he disappeared into the wing.

65
00:09:32,824 --> 00:09:34,124
While people are watching the clothes burn up,

66
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:36,324
he comes to the audience seats!

67
00:09:36,324 --> 00:09:37,324
Yes.

68
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:42,424
But the levitation magic was amazing, right?

69
00:09:42,424 --> 00:09:44,424
It looked like he was really flying!

70
00:09:44,424 --> 00:09:46,424
I didn't see any wire at all.

71
00:09:46,424 --> 00:09:48,524
For that, he used a bar to hold his body in place,

72
00:09:48,524 --> 00:09:52,124
and there was a crane behind the curtain to move the bar.

73
00:09:52,924 --> 00:09:54,924
The curtain can be cut lengthwise and sideways.

74
00:09:54,924 --> 00:09:57,024
The audience pays attention only to the magician above

75
00:09:57,024 --> 00:09:59,524
who they think is being suspended in air by a wire.

76
00:09:59,524 --> 00:10:01,224
Enough!

77
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:03,324
You guys speak no more!

78
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:08,024
For God's sake.

79
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,924
You're the ones who wanted to know how the tricks worked.

80
00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:21,224
Now, it's time for today's last illusion.

81
00:10:21,224 --> 00:10:24,524
It's just a little dangerous magic, "Escape from water"!

82
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:35,424
With both hands and feet handcuffed,

83
00:10:35,424 --> 00:10:38,324
he will try to escape from this aquarium which is sealed with a chain.

84
00:10:38,324 --> 00:10:42,624
Please give a big applause if he makes it through!

85
00:11:07,324 --> 00:11:08,924
It's taking too long.

86
00:11:18,824 --> 00:11:21,224
Ran, it's been almost 10 minutes

87
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:23,224
since he went into the water, right?

88
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,224
Yes.

89
00:11:25,124 --> 00:11:26,224
Close the curtain!

90
00:11:26,224 --> 00:11:29,024
Somebody, bring an axe!

91
00:11:29,024 --> 00:11:31,124
There has been a minor complication.

92
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:33,324
Please wait for a moment.

93
00:11:33,324 --> 00:11:38,024
That's what the legendary magician Harry Houdini used to do.

94
00:11:38,024 --> 00:11:41,824
Yes, that's too common in escape tricks.

95
00:11:41,824 --> 00:11:43,824
-Let's go! Ran! -Yes!

96
00:11:46,524 --> 00:11:48,824
They're gone, Hattori.

97
00:11:55,024 --> 00:11:56,724
Excuse me!

98
00:11:57,324 --> 00:11:58,524
You can't go in!

99
00:11:59,424 --> 00:12:01,524
-You can't... -Get out of the way!

100
00:12:10,024 --> 00:12:12,724
Ran! Break the aquarium with your karate!

101
00:12:41,424 --> 00:12:44,424
Somehow, I made it.

102
00:12:44,424 --> 00:12:46,724
To my luck,

103
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,024
and to these two brave ladies

104
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:52,224
who made this show even more exciting.

105
00:12:52,224 --> 00:12:54,124
Please give them a warm hand.

106
00:13:01,124 --> 00:13:03,624
Hey, Hattori.

107
00:13:03,624 --> 00:13:05,224
Yes, what?

108
00:13:06,324 --> 00:13:09,224
That wasn't a part of the show, right?

109
00:13:09,224 --> 00:13:10,624
I don't know.

110
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:18,367
"Hoshikawa. Waiting Room"

111
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:20,767
-I'm so sorry! -I'm so sorry!

112
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:24,467
We just thought you were gonna die. Right, Ran?

113
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:26,967
Yes! I'm sorry.

114
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:29,267
Don't worry about it.

115
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:34,067
In fact, I'm still alive partly thanks to you ladies.

116
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:35,167
-Huh? -Huh?

117
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:38,167
"Dogo Hoshikawa (27), Magician" -I heard your voices

118
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:41,367
when I was half unconscious underwater.

119
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:44,267
Your love brought me back to life.

120
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,267
-Really? -Really?

121
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:48,167
He's telling a lie.

122
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:51,367
He was probably hiding a pin or something in his mouth

123
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:52,967
to unlock the handcuffs.

124
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:55,767
I guess he was out of the aquarium way before. What do you think?

125
00:13:55,767 --> 00:14:00,667
Yes, people believe it's impossible to open the aquarium

126
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:03,367
since they saw it being sealed with a chain.

127
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:06,267
But the truth is, some part of the cover has no chain on it.

128
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:09,267
And from that space, it is possible to escape.

129
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:10,767
All he needs is to wait behind the curtain

130
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,467
until the audience starts to worry.

131
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:14,667
As the staff give him the sign,

132
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:17,367
he pours water over his head and shows up.

133
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:21,367
Now, the great breathtaking-escape illusion is done!

134
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:27,667
Well, it was great, Hoshikawa.

135
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,767
"Riki Handa (41), Magician" -I was just thinking about you and I

136
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:31,967
doing some collaborative performance. What do you think?

137
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:34,667
Sure. If it's okay with you.

138
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,567
That would be a great help,

139
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:39,067
since you're a popular man now.

140
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:43,867
Would you mind if I joined you guys?

141
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:48,267
We should make clear,

142
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:52,167
"Tenko Himemiya (32), Magician" -which one of us three

143
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:55,767
is the true heir of our master, Mr. Masakage.

144
00:14:57,367 --> 00:14:59,467
Mr. Masakage?

145
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:02,367
He was a mysterious magician who used to be on TV and stage

146
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:06,067
but disappeared all of a sudden about 10 years ago.

147
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:10,067
I heard he's still alive somewhere.

148
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:11,867
Mr. Masakage.

149
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:16,167
I never knew these three people were Mr. Masakage's pupils.

150
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:18,667
Oh, yes!

151
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,767
If we wanna perform together, then why don't we get Kazumi Sanada

152
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:23,967
since he's as popular as Hoshikawa,

153
00:15:23,967 --> 00:15:27,567
and name the event "Dream Collaboration of the Four Magic Kings"!

154
00:15:27,567 --> 00:15:29,467
Kazumi Sanada?

155
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:31,367
I wouldn't mind.

156
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:33,867
I don't know if he's up to it though.

157
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:38,167
We actually never met him before although we were in the same field.

158
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:41,767
Hey, Ran, you've met this Kazumi Sanada guy before, right?

159
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:45,867
Yes. First, it was when Sonoko invited me

160
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:48,367
at the cruise party for the Zaibatsu Suzuki's 60th anniversary.

161
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:51,167
Kid sent us a letter.

162
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:52,967
So for the entertainment at the party,

163
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:56,067
Sonoko's mother hired Mr. Sanada to disguise as Kid.

164
00:15:57,067 --> 00:16:00,467
I met him for the second time when Motoyasu Tsukumo,

165
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:02,567
a genius magician's wife

166
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:05,367
asked my dad to investigate the cause of his death.

167
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:09,567
Mr. Tsukumo had three pupils and Mr. Sanada was one of them.

168
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:13,367
Really? You never know who's connected to who.

169
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:17,567
Then, we should ask this lady to get in touch with Sanada.

170
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:21,867
Now, I think we should head to master's house and talk.

171
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:23,267
How about you guys?

172
00:16:23,267 --> 00:16:26,167
We could show you a simple magic show after dinner if you like.

173
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:29,067
-Oh, are you serious? -Can we do that?

174
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:33,167
But why his house?

175
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,267
For God's sake, have you forgotten?

176
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:38,467
Today is the day master disappeared 10 years ago.

177
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:43,467
He may just decide to return home today, you know?

178
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:50,767
"Masakage"

179
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:52,867
Oh, hello there!

180
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,067
"Mari Masakage (54), Wife of Mr. Masakage"

181
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:57,567
Is it Tenko and Hoshikawa back there?

182
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:58,667
Hello.

183
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:00,167
Long time no see!

184
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:03,567
It's been quite a while. I guess it's been what, 10 years?

185
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:05,667
Oh, sorry, who are those people?

186
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:07,667
They're our special guests tonight!

187
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:09,267
-Nice to you meet you! -Nice to you meet you!

188
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:12,667
All right, I guess I should go and get some more groceries for tonight.

189
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:14,367
Oh no, don't.

190
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,267
We thought so...

191
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:18,367
so here it is!

192
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:19,567
I see.

193
00:17:20,467 --> 00:17:23,967
So you've been visiting here the same date every year.

194
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,667
Yes, in anticipation that master might just come back.

195
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:31,767
Unfortunately, we've heard nothing from him these past 10 years.

196
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:34,167
Well, this brings back memories.

197
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:37,067
Yes, we used to live here together

198
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:39,467
and went through master's intensive training together.

199
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:42,867
Well, Hoshikawa, I think you used to drop by here

200
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:44,867
even before my husband decided to have pupils, right?

201
00:17:44,867 --> 00:17:48,267
Then, Mr. Hoshikawa is his first pupil.

202
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,067
It doesn't matter who's first and who's last.

203
00:17:51,067 --> 00:17:56,167
What matters is, who's surpasses master as a magician.

204
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:58,267
Hey, Tenko.

205
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:02,467
If we're really going to do a show together,

206
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:06,567
the highlight of my magic will be "Witch Reborn"!

207
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:10,867
I'm gonna place a huge cross in the middle of the audience

208
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:14,067
and tie myself to it.

209
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:16,267
I'll have the audience fire it up,

210
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:20,567
and before the cross burns out, I'll vanish.

211
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:24,467
Next time you see me is when I emerge out of the ashes.

212
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:27,967
What do you think?

213
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,467
It's breathtaking and exciting, isn't it?

214
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:35,667
I should start preparing dinner now.

215
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:38,767
Okay, let us help you then.

216
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:39,967
Sure!

217
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:43,767
I think I'll look around the house since it's been a while.

218
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:45,467
That's a good idea.

219
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:48,667
Actually, I'm gonna go to my room and take a nap.

220
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:50,667
I had to wake up early this morning.

221
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:53,467
All right. We'll call you when dinner is ready.

222
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,467
Hattori, she just changed the atmosphere, didn't she?

223
00:18:57,467 --> 00:18:58,567
She did.

224
00:18:59,467 --> 00:19:02,167
-Today, I'm going to... -What?

225
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:06,467
You want me to call the magician, Kazumi Sanada?

226
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:08,167
I can't do that!

227
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:10,967
I don't even know his phone number!

228
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:14,467
True. We only met him twice. I guess it's impossible.

229
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:16,967
Hey, Ran, where are you now?

230
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:19,167
I'm starving to death!

231
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,767
Sorry, dad, I think we'll be late.

232
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:23,467
Why don't you eat in a restaurant?

233
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:25,967
Ran, I need you to help me!

234
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,467
What? Hey!

235
00:19:30,467 --> 00:19:32,167
Hey!

236
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:34,767
I just can't handle this all alone, Ran!

237
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:37,367
What? Where is Mrs. Masakage?

238
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:40,367
She went out to get some seasoning because we ran out,

239
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:43,267
and although it's been quite a while, she still hasn't come back.

240
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:46,167
I was gonna ask the boys for a help, but...

241
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:52,067
I can't do this.

242
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:54,767
This knife isn't as sharp as my deductions are.

243
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:55,867
Yes.

244
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:57,467
I think cohesiveness is a necessary factor

245
00:19:57,467 --> 00:19:59,167
when it comes to deductions.

246
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:08,967
I guess we did all right.

247
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:12,567
I made you two do all the work. I'm so sorry.

248
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:14,767
Oh, that's okay. Right?

249
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:15,967
Yes.

250
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:17,367
How's it coming?

251
00:20:19,267 --> 00:20:21,167
It looks yummy.

252
00:20:22,267 --> 00:20:24,667
Huh? Where're your friends?

253
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:27,967
-They're treating their wound in the kitchen. -What?

254
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:31,067
It seems one of them cut their finger with the knife.

255
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:33,967
Okay, I'll go and wake Handa up.

256
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:37,267
He usually will stay in the room way in the back of the first floor.

257
00:20:37,267 --> 00:20:40,667
Hoshikawa, would you please go and get Tenko?

258
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:45,467
Sure. She's most probably in that room that I think she's in.

259
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:46,867
Which room?

260
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:50,367
Oh, I mean Mr. Masakage's room.

261
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:53,867
There're pictures and instruments for old magic tricks there.

262
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:56,567
There are many memorable objects in that room.

263
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:58,767
-What? -Old magic tricks?

264
00:20:58,767 --> 00:21:00,967
Would you like to take a look?

265
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:03,267
-Yes! -Why not?

266
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:09,067
Mr. Masakage designed and built this house himself.

267
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,267
-I see. -I see.

268
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:12,867
His room is on the second floor.

269
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:24,367
It's a narrow hallway.

270
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:27,267
It's kinda dark and scary too.

271
00:21:27,267 --> 00:21:30,967
That door on the right is master's room.

272
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:39,967
Maybe the light bulb burned out.

273
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,667
-What is it? -A blackout?

274
00:21:45,067 --> 00:21:46,367
Where's the breaker?

275
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:51,567
I guess it's not in this room.

276
00:21:53,467 --> 00:21:55,767
Hi, Mrs. Masakage. Where's the breaker?

277
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:58,367
It's in the next room. In the bathroom.

278
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:04,267
Okay, I found it.

279
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:26,167
-Hattori! -Yes!

280
00:22:27,467 --> 00:22:30,267
What is it? What's going on?

281
00:24:31,894 --> 00:24:33,894
Next Conan's Hint:

282
00:24:33,894 --> 00:24:36,094
"Narrow hallway"

283
00:24:36,094 --> 00:24:37,494
-Next week, we'll have a battle. -Yes.

284
00:24:37,494 --> 00:24:41,094
-Oh, you mean a magic battle? -No! A deduction battle!
