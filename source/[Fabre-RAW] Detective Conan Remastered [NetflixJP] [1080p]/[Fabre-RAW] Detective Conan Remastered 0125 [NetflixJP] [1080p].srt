1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,480
Alibis, secret codes, tricks and deals.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,580
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,480
Today we'll find out who the real assassin is.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,480
The killing and motive are full of mystery.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,180
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,180
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,680
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,090
Pops who was invited to a celebration party for a champion sumo player

9
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,590
were asked by Seiji Ishimoto to do an investigation for him.

10
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:05,790
Ishimoto had received a blackmail saying that he would be killed.

11
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,590
The event hall becomes dark,

12
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,390
and the politician Masao Takada passes behind Ishimoto

13
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,490
in order to make his speech.

14
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,090
The bullet that was fired from the lighting box

15
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,790
skims pass Ishimoto's shoulder

16
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,190
and pierces through Takada's chest.

17
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,390
Within the commotion.

18
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,890
I happened to see a suspicious man flee from the light fixture box.

19
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,390
The following day,

20
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:38,690
that man, blackmailer Shiro Hiraoka was found dead.

21
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:39,990
I see.

22
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,490
We were being deceived by the culprit.

23
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,790
But I'll figure it out for sure

24
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,990
and untangle the one string of truth

25
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,390
among the complicated and tangled strings!

26
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:58,990
"Mysterious Assassin (Part 2)"

27
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,290
The top floor.

28
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,390
It must be where the president's room is.

29
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,890
It's Mr. Niikura, the secretary of Mr. Takada who was shot and killed.

30
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,590
Shiro Hiraoka?

31
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,590
I don't know such a man.

32
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,390
You received a threat letter

33
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,190
and is actually the target of the killer.

34
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,290
Furthermore, the bullet that skimmed by you

35
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,790
hit Mr. Takada in the chest and killed him.

36
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,590
This is a murder case.

37
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,490
-Actually... -President.

38
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,890
It's okay, Ms. Yukiko.

39
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,890
We can't keep hiding the fact, can we?

40
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,690
Just as you say, I was being blackmailed by Hiraoka.

41
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,590
You don't want this account to be publicized, do you?

42
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,090
You'll be nabbed for evasion of taxes,

43
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,590
and your company's reputation will go down the drain.

44
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,890
So, you want me to give you 10 billion yen?

45
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,990
I think that's cheap.

46
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,990
You're making a lot of money, aren't you, Mr. Ishimoto?

47
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,890
I thought of paying him.

48
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,790
But I flatly refused.

49
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,790
Once I give him the money,

50
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,490
I am sure that he'd come back and threaten me for more later.

51
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,290
That's why I thought of having you come in protect me, Mr. Mouri.

52
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:57,890
However, that ended up in getting Mr. Takada killed.

53
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,990
That's what his secretary Mr. Niikura said to me.

54
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,090
Mr. Niikura said that?

55
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,790
He told me to not put Mr. Takada's life to waste.

56
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:13,190
He told me in the other room to tell the police everything I knew.

57
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,890
Huh? What is it, kid?

58
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,190
Well...

59
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,290
Conan! Why are you here?

60
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,490
Ran told me to bring you some change of clothes.

61
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,190
Mr. Ishimoto, could I have you come to the station with me?

62
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,590
Yes.

63
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,290
Which means that I'm not needed here anymore?

64
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,090
It was only for a short while,

65
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,590
but thank you all the same.

66
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,790
I thought so.

67
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,490
How unlucky of me,

68
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,490
for the murder to be solved so quickly.

69
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,490
Talking about unlucky,

70
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,790
the man called Hiraoka was sure unlucky, too.

71
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,290
Because he was supposed to have shot Mr. Ishimoto

72
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,290
and yet the bullet hit someone else.

73
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,290
On top of that, he falls down from the stairs and dies.

74
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,590
He's really unlucky, isn't he?

75
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,590
lt really does seem to be unlucky.

76
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,990
Or rather, everything fits too nicely together.

77
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,890
Maybe Hiraoka had an accomplice,

78
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,490
and that person killed Hiraoka who goofed to shut him up.

79
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,490
Which means that Mr. Ishimoto may still be in danger of being killed!

80
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,990
Ms. Yukiko!

81
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,390
I'm not done with this job yet!

82
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,590
Wait, Pops!

83
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,290
Oh, well.

84
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,890
I guess I'll take a look around the room while I can.

85
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,090
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

86
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,490
Excuse me then, for I am in a rush.

87
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,490
Somebody's coming.

88
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,090
That man is...

89
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:10,990
He was talking to Ms. Yukiko after Mr. Takada was killed.

90
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,790
That's...

91
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,990
What is his relationship with Ms. Yukiko?

92
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,490
And what is he going to do

93
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,590
with the remote controller that he was holding?

94
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,990
Maybe...

95
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,390
If Hiraoka

96
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:08,290
had realized that he was just hired to be framed as the killer...

97
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:11,590
No, even if he didn't know about it,

98
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,690
he's Hiraoka the blackmailer.

99
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:18,590
He could've hidden something that would serve as evidence.

100
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,090
There's a hole here.

101
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,190
Ms. Yukiko...

102
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,990
I'm back.

103
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,690
Where were you all this time, Conan?

104
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,190
Well...

105
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,590
Pops, aren't you guarding Mr. Ishimoto anymore?

106
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,590
I don't need to guard him while he's at the police station.

107
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,790
I can't wait to guard Yukiko real closely.

108
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,790
Hey, come on. Is that the only thing on your mind, Pops?

109
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,590
Excuse me, Mr. Mouri.

110
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,590
Inspector Megure.

111
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,490
Inspector!

112
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,590
I have something I'd like to confirm with you.

113
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,690
Here's some coffee.

114
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,490
Thank you, Ran.

115
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,690
Inspector Megure.

116
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,390
What is it that you want to confirm with me?

117
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,490
You took Mr. Ishimoto to the hospital last night

118
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,490
but how long after that

119
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,590
did his secretary, Ms. Yukiko Tanaka stay at the hospital?

120
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,790
Ms. Yukiko?

121
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,690
Let's see, if I'm not mistaken...

122
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,590
After Mr. Ishimoto went back into his room,

123
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,790
I was talking story with Yukiko over a glass of cola.

124
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:00,490
That was just about when you called.

125
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,390
I sort of dozed off after that.

126
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:09,190
I got up the next morning when you called.

127
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:13,490
At that time, Yukiko was nowhere in the room.

128
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:18,490
Then, you don't know when Ms. Yukiko left the hospital?

129
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,590
Inspector, don't tell me that...

130
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:25,790
In other words, Ms. Yukiko had time to kill Hiraoka.

131
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,190
That can't be!

132
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,090
Why would such a beautiful woman like Ms. Yukiko kill Hiraoka?

133
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,090
I'm just considering it as one possibility.

134
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,390
It's not yet definite whether Hiraoka's death

135
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,490
is an accident or a homicide.

136
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,990
Ridiculous!

137
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,990
Why would Ms. Yukiko do something like that?

138
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:45,490
The thing is she has a lover called Kenichi Shibata.

139
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,490
Lover?

140
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,290
What are you shouting for?

141
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,090
No, it's nothing.

142
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:56,090
That guy 's father committed suicide.

143
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,790
Suicide?

144
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,590
He committed suicide because the company that he was managing

145
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,990
was forced into bankruptcy by Mr. Ishimoto.

146
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,790
Mr. Shibata hated Mr. Ishimoto because of that.

147
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:11,890
Being his lover, I'm sure that Ms. Yukiko felt the same about him.

148
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,590
However, Ms. Yukiko would never do something like that.

149
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,390
What kind of person is Mr. Shibata?

150
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,190
It's him.

151
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,590
Just as I thought.

152
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,890
I'm sure I've seen him somewhere.

153
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,090
Are you sure, Mr. Mouri?

154
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,490
It was quite recent.

155
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,890
That's right!

156
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,190
I see. So, that's what it was.

157
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,690
Inspector.

158
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,490
Please gather all those involved in the incident

159
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,890
in the event hall we used last night.

160
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,290
Huh? Why?

161
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,490
I, the renown detective, Kogoro Mouri

162
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,990
will solve this incident for you!

163
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,080
With the death of Mr. Takada and all,

164
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,980
"Tsuneaki Niikura (32)" -I'm really busy.

165
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,180
You've got to be kidding. Gathering all of is at a time like this.

166
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,780
"Kenichi Shibata (29)" -Why do I who has nothing to do with this incident

167
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,480
have to be called here?

168
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,180
"Yukiko Tanaka (25)" -Kenichi, cool it.

169
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,880
It's going to end soon.

170
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,880
"Seiji Ishimoto (54)" -Wasn't the murder incident already solved?

171
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,580
We'll clear that right away.

172
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,580
Actually, it's not a very good idea to bring you here

173
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,680
because we are still interrogating you.

174
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,980
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, everyone!

175
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,780
Oh, Mr. Mouri!

176
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,980
I had you all gather here today

177
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,580
because I wanted to make clear who killed Mr. Takada

178
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,380
at the place where he was murdered.

179
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,280
Isn't the culprit is Hiraoka who died of an accident?

180
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,580
No!

181
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,580
Hiraoka was only being used by the real culprit

182
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,880
and was eventually killed.

183
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,980
Hurry up and give us the name of that culprit then!

184
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,980
I have a meeting to go to and it's already begun.

185
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,980
I have a part-time job that I have to go to, too.

186
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,980
Hurry up or I'm going to leave!

187
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,480
Okay, let me tell you the whole truth.

188
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,280
The real culprit is you!

189
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,880
Because you wanted to kill Mr. Ishimoto

190
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,680
who was the cause of your father committing suicide,

191
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,480
you hired Hiraoka.

192
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,880
However, Hiraoka goofed and didn't kill Mr. Ishimoto.

193
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,980
Therefore, you decided to kill Hiraoka last night

194
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,180
in order to shut him up.

195
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,080
Wait a minute.

196
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,880
It's obvious that I hate Ishimoto,

197
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,280
and I was here at this hall last night, too.

198
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,280
But I don't even know what this Hiraoka guy looks like.

199
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,880
Besides, after I left here,

200
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,780
I was busy at my part-time job that I couldn't go anywhere.

201
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,280
Would you like to come with me and find out for yourself

202
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,480
because I have to go to work now?

203
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,780
I have a lot of people who can testify my alibi.

204
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,880
No, well...

205
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,480
Oh, no.

206
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,580
So, here it comes after all.

207
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,280
Mr. Mouri?

208
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,080
What's the matter, Pops?

209
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,980
Are you all right?

210
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,280
I sat down because I figured it would take a while to explain.

211
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,380
You go and stay put.

212
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,580
Okay!

213
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,280
Now, let's get down to business.

214
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,680
Before I give you the culprit's name,

215
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:41,480
let me explain how the murder was carried out last night.

216
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,280
From the part where Mr. Takada starts walking towards the stage.

217
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,580
Well, everyone.

218
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,180
Will you please all move to where you were last night?

219
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,380
Inspector, please take Mr. Takada's position.

220
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,480
What? Me?

221
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,180
Right.

222
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,680
Oh, all right.

223
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,880
Inspector, please the microphone that is on the table on your chest.

224
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,980
Microphone?

225
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,780
That's the same microphone that Mr. Takada was wearing last night.

226
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,680
Mr. Detective, what do you want me to do?

227
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,280
Please go over to the wall.

228
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,380
Okay.

229
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,680
Okay, so let's begin.

230
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,180
Please switch off the lights and turn on the spotlight!

231
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,380
Mr. Niikura.

232
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,080
Please walk as you did last night

233
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,680
when you lead the way for Mr. Takada.

234
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,880
Officer Takagi.

235
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,280
What is it, Conan?

236
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,080
Pops asks you to go over to the light box.

237
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,680
You have that remote controller on you, don't you?

238
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,780
Pops sees through everything, you know.

239
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,480
Will you turn the remote controller on when I give you a signal?

240
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,480
Now!

241
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,580
That was an empty cartridge,

242
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,280
but it skimmed by Mr. Ishimoto's shoulder

243
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,680
and went right through the Inspector's chest.

244
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,180
What do you mean?

245
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,580
Please turn on the light!

246
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,480
What...

247
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,080
Officer Takagi, did you just fire the gun?

248
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,580
No, I didn't do anything.

249
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,380
Huh? This is...

250
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,780
There is a gun stuck to the pin spotlight!

251
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,980
What?

252
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,080
Moreover, a motor is set onto the gun and a fishing string

253
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,880
is attached to the trigger,

254
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,280
When the motor spins and winds the string,

255
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,480
the trigger is set to go off.

256
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,680
Mr. Mouri, what is the meaning of this?

257
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,280
It means that Hiraoka did not fire the gun,

258
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,580
but the gun was set up and attached to the pin spotlight to begin with.

259
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,380
The lightings in this hall are the newest ones around.

260
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,180
That pin spotlight

261
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,480
responds to the microphone that the Inspector is wearing on his chest,

262
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,380
and moves automatically.

263
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,580
What?

264
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,380
Oh, I see.

265
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,680
Moreover,

266
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,080
if it is set up so that it can be operated using a remote controller,

267
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,280
the culprit can fire the gun anytime at will

268
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,080
and aim it at Mr. Takada's chest and kill him.

269
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,580
What do you think you're saying, Mr. Mouri?

270
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,880
Mr. Ishimoto was the target, wasn't he?

271
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,980
He was even blackmailed.

272
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,380
That was only a scheme to deceive police.

273
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,280
The culprit was after Mr. Takada's life to begin with.

274
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,380
The culprit sent a threat letter to Mr. Ishimoto first

275
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:58,380
to make it look like someone really after his life.

276
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,080
Then, the culprit used the function of the spotlight

277
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,680
responding to the movement of the microphone on Mr. Takada's chest,

278
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,680
and the moment Mr. Takada passed by Mr. Ishimoto...

279
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,980
This way, the culprit made it look like the bullet

280
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,280
that was aimed at Mr. Ishimoto missed him

281
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,280
and in turn killed Mr. Takada.

282
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,480
After that, Hiraoka removed the gun and motor and fled.

283
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,380
Then, who killed Mr. Takada?

284
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,580
It's Ishimoto!

285
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,180
Huh?

286
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,980
Ishimoto over there killed Mr. Takada.

287
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,480
Don't be ridiculous. That's all baloney!

288
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,080
No use playing dumb with me.

289
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,580
I've already got proof.

290
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,180
Huh? And just what is that?

291
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,580
I found the remote controller

292
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,880
that was used to operate the motor of the gun at your company.

293
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,880
-What? -Huh?

294
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,580
Is that true?

295
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,780
You really thought it out well, Ishimoto!

296
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,880
You pretended to be blackmailed by Hiraoka,

297
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,280
but behind the scene, you were in this together.

298
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,380
And just when Mr. Takada passed behind you

299
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,380
you operated the remote controller and killed him.

300
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,580
Isn't that right, Mr. Detective?

301
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,980
Mr. Shibata.

302
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,080
Your deduction has one serious mistake.

303
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,280
What?

304
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,880
Think about it.

305
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,180
Mr. Takada walked behind Mr. Ishimoto

306
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,580
only because he was being led that way by Mr. Niikura.

307
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,980
There was no way that Mr. Ishimoto could've foreseen that.

308
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,280
Then, why was the remote controller found in Mr. Ishimoto's room?

309
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,780
You heard was he just said, didn't you, everyone?

310
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,180
Huh?

311
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,980
Yes, I heard him all right.

312
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,480
I said that I found the remote controller

313
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,980
that was used at Ishimoto's company.

314
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,480
I said nothing of finding it in his room.

315
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,780
You've turned yourself in, Mr. Niikura.

316
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,480
You're the culprit!

317
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,780
You've been thought

318
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,880
to become Mr. Takada's successor for quite some time.

319
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,380
But he had no intention of resigning.

320
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,980
Therefore, you became impatient

321
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,180
and set Hiraoka up as your accomplice

322
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,280
and killed Mr. Takada.

323
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,080
Moreover, in order to shut Hiraoka up,

324
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,280
you pushed him off the stairs of the dilapidated building

325
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,480
and killed him.

326
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,080
After that,

327
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,780
you couldn't find the motor that Hiraoka had hidden

328
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,980
between the space in the floor.

329
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,680
So, you thought up a scheme.

330
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,780
In order to deceive the police just in case the motor were to be found,

331
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:55,780
you decided to hide the remote controller in Mr. Ishimoto's room.

332
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,580
Don't be ridiculous.

333
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:02,680
Do you have proof that the remote controller is mine?

334
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,280
You're very cautious,

335
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,980
so I'm sure that you left no fingerprints behind.

336
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,380
But don't you remember?

337
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,580
You dropped the remote controller that night

338
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,580
when you exchanged name cards, didn't you?

339
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,680
At that time, you picked the battery up with your bare hands

340
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,380
and put it back into the remote controller right away.

341
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,080
So, you do remember.

342
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,180
Yes.

343
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,980
Your fingerprints are on that battery!

344
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,680
Oh, no.

345
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,380
This can't be!

346
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,680
No way!

He's been that way

349
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,080
ever since he's read the letter he received from Ms. Yukiko.

350
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,480
Ms. Yukiko says she's going to try it all over with Mr. Shibata again.

351
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,680
I'd like Mom and Dad to try it over again.

352
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,880
What a fleeting love affair it was!

353
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,580
Excuse me. I'd like you to find someone for me.

354
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,080
Please leave it to me!

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,080
