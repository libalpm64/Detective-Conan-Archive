1
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,740
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,740
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,440
The summer camp smells of crime.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,140
The Youth Detective Squad helps out a lot.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,140
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,860
Oh, hello, Megumi? It's me, Ayumi.

9
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:05,060
Megumi, about next Saturday...

10
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,360
I have something to do,

11
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,160
but I'm supposed to be rabbit monitor that day,

12
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,860
so I was wondering if you could change places with me.

13
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,660
Oh, okay! You're going out with Conan, right?

14
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,660
You're going camping with Conan and the others, right?

15
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,560
Yeah, could you...

16
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,060
Okay, I'll change with you!

17
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,160
But promise that you'll tell me about your trip like always!

18
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,460
Because every time you and Conan go out together,

19
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,560
you get mixed up in a case of one kind or another.

20
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,960
Okay! I'll tell you everything that goes on!

21
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,060
See you! Thank you! Megumi!

22
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,660
All right!

23
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,660
I get to go camping! I get to go camping Saturday and Sunday!

24
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,260
Oh, no.

25
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,360
I wonder why everybody seems to treat Haibara

26
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,360
as if she were an adult.

27
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,560
Everybody tends to call her by her last name.

28
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,860
I guess it can't be helped because people who transfer over

29
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,060
from other schools seem mature.

30
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,360
But, friends shouldn't discriminate!

31
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,760
"I want to call Haibara by her first name, Ai"

32
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,860
"Friendship Torn Apart (Part 1)"

33
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,560
Haibara and Doc are late.

34
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,760
I wonder what's keeping them.

35
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,360
Doc's probably taking his time getting ready again!

36
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,960
Okay, when she comes out, I'm going to smile naturally

37
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,060
and say good morning to her and call her by her first name.

38
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,260
I wonder if she'll be offended.

39
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:39,260
Oh, but she might just greet me intimately too.

40
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,260
But, in her case, most times not...

41
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,460
Well, it doesn't matter if she greets me the same way or not!

42
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,560
After all, we're friends!

43
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,060
Oh, Doc! You're late!

44
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,260
It's way past departure time!

45
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,260
Sorry, sorry. It took a while for us to get prepared.

46
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,960
It's because you didn't get everything ready before going to sleep!

47
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,560
You got me there.

48
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,860
What you took time doing was not getting ready

49
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,260
but cleaning up, right?

50
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,260
The minute I take my eyes off you, there are heaps of trash.

51
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,560
Oh, good morning.

52
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,360
Ai... Ah...

53
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,160
Oh, I think you look so sleepy, Haibara.

54
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,160
Sort of. Because I'm nocturnal.

55
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,760
Never mind.

56
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,260
I still have a lot of time left.

57
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,260
Camping! Camping!

58
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,260
Let's have a happy camping trip!

59
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,060
Camping today and camping tomorrow!

60
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,760
Camping! Camping!

61
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,160
Hey, Doc.

62
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,060
Did you find out the meaning of that diary?

63
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,860
What diary?

64
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,260
The diary of Mr. Itakura, the computer programmer,

65
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,060
who was asked by the Men in Black

66
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,660
to make some kind of system software!

67
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,060
The diary that had the secret dealings of the Black Organization

68
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:02,060
were written in invisible ink on the blank page.

69
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,060
The meaning of the mysterious last word

70
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,260
that was written inside!

71
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,360
Oh, you mean the words...

72
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,660
"We are trying to revive the dead"?

73
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,460
I have no idea what those words mean

74
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,360
but I've found out that the woman hates cats!

75
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,760
She hates cats?

76
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,060
I stopped reading then, because Ai came along,

77
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,260
but there was a continuation to that diary.

78
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,060
"After she finished saying so,"

79
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,160
"the meowing of the cat started getting louder behind her."

80
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,660
"The woman started to panic a bit and hung up the phone."

81
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,060
That's what was written.

82
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,360
That's like knowing nothing at all.

83
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,560
She could've hung up because her cat frolicked with her.

84
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,860
There are also people who are allergic to cats, right?

85
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:59,360
Only if you knew more about Haibara's father, Dr. Atsushi Miyano.

86
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,960
Atsushi Miyano?

87
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,760
I know Dr. Miyano.

88
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,560
I think I met him once or twice at the invention announcement site.

89
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,460
You mean you know the mad scientist

90
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,760
who was ousted from the scientific society?

91
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,860
Mad scientist?

92
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,560
Dr. Miyano was a nice and friendly man.

93
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,360
He took a liking to my inventions too.

94
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,260
His wife was reticent

95
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,060
and you could never tell what she was thinking.

96
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,160
If I remember correctly, her name was Eleina.

97
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,960
Eleina? You mean his wife wasn't Japanese?

98
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,960
Nope. They seem to have met when she was here in Japan

99
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,460
as an exchange student from England.

100
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,560
But, I had no idea that she was Ai's mother.

101
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,260
I see. No wonder she looks a bit non-Japanese.

102
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,560
Come to think of it, Dr. Miyano never mentioned

103
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,960
what he was researching...

104
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,760
Hey, look ahead!

105
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,760
What's wrong?

106
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,660
Thank god.

107
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,160
Be careful, will you, Doc?

108
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,760
It's because you talked to me while I'm driving.

109
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,760
What a big car!

110
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,860
Wow, fantastic.

111
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,260
It looks to be a camping car.

112
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,860
It shouldn't be left in a place like this, it's dangerous.

113
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,960
Nobody seems to be inside.

114
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,560
How lucky. I'm sure camping would be a lot of fun

115
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,060
if we get to come in a car like this!

116
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,060
Hey, brats!

117
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,960
Quit touching my car with those dirty hands of yours!

118
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,460
It's our best friend's precious car!

119
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,960
Right, Haruka?

120
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,860
Yes.

121
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,360
But, I don't think my uncle

122
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,560
who lent me the car would mind them just touching it.

123
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,160
You're kind to kids, aren't you?

124
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,460
You blasted me when I smoked in the car and then...

125
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,160
You smoke too much, Reiji!

126
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,360
That's why you fell for her, right Reiji, because she's kind?

127
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,660
Shut up.

128
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,360
Oh, so it was your car.

129
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,460
I'm so sorry.

130
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,360
It was such a rare car that I couldn't help myself.

131
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,960
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,160
But our hands aren't all that dirty!

133
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,660
Okay, sonny.

134
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,960
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,360
Yasumi, will you come take a look?

136
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,760
I think the meat's just about ready, already.

137
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,260
Wow, it looks delicious!

138
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,960
The meat looks really expensive!

139
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,560
Would you like to join us?

140
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,860
Since there's some more meat left anyway.

141
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,460
-Are you serious? -But, that's for tonight.

142
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,260
Come on, don't get stingy!

143
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,660
If we run low, we can always borrow Haruka's wallet

144
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,560
and go get some more from the supermarket at the foot of the mountain!

145
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,860
Right, Haruka?

146
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,360
Yes.

147
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,860
Please eat to your heart's content!

148
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,360
All right!

149
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,960
This is delicious!

150
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,260
You're members of a university club.

151
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,360
Yes, the name's The Outdoor Club!

152
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,660
We go to the mountains and the beach.

153
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,260
We all went to Hawaii together before too!

154
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,160
Well, everything is thanks to our sponsor, Haruka, though!

155
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,960
Not really.

156
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,160
Yasumi, you're good at cooking and Reiji's a good driver.

157
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,760
I don't have any special talents like

158
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,460
picking edible mountain plants or fishing like our cook here so...

159
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,660
the most I can do is dish out cash.

160
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,460
I'm a helpless Ms. Richie-Rich,

161
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,660
so the most I can do is dish out cash.

162
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,460
If only for once in my life, I'd like to say something like that!

163
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,860
No...

164
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,260
Honestly, you're way too good for a womanizer like Reiji!

165
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,660
Didn't I just tell you to shut up?

166
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,760
A rich friend, huh?

167
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,360
They're just like Ran and Sonoko.

168
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,660
Are you feeling sick or something? You don't seem to be eating much.

169
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,960
No.

170
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,460
I was just thinking, that's how things usually are...

171
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,560
Are you ready? Here goes!

172
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,860
-How about it? -Too bad. 10 seconds 31!

173
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,860
You couldn't make it under 10 seconds!

174
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,060
No joke! And I was quite confident.

175
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,360
Too bad!

176
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,760
Oh? That belt.

177
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,460
It's the same kind that Yoko Okino was wearing the other day!

178
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,760
That's right!

179
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,360
She was wearing her outfit for her new song, right?

180
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,460
But, I'm the one who found this first!

181
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,560
You've been wearing that a lot recently, haven't you, Yasumi?

182
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,060
Because it's the same as something an idol is wearing!

183
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,060
That's right!

184
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,660
Why don't you eat at our place for dinner

185
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,660
as a token of our appreciation for lunch?

186
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,960
Oh, really?

187
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,860
Wow, that sounds great!

188
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,060
I guess we can take it easy till dinner time, then!

189
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,160
Yeah!

190
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,760
How is it, Conan?

191
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,460
Yep, I think it's good.

192
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,560
Let me taste it too!

193
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,760
If you taste it, half of the curry will be gone, so you may not!

194
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,460
Oh well, so sorry.

195
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,760
I'll go get the other people then!

196
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,260
Oh, let's go together!

197
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,760
Ah... Ai...

198
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,260
Ai... Ice... I wonder if it'll make them happy

199
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,060
if I told them we also have ice cream.

200
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,660
I guess so.

201
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,060
Wow! This curry is delicious!

202
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,360
I'd like to make our chef taste this too!

203
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,160
Huh? Where's Yasumi?

204
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,360
I haven't seen her for quite some time.

205
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,960
Her bicycle's not here so it seems she's gone somewhere.

206
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,260
Going shopping to the foot of the mountain is too far.

207
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,160
Maybe she went there.

208
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,060
The time is just about right too.

209
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,560
There?

210
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,560
There's a great place about 5 minutes uphill by car from here.

211
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,960
I guess I'll go look for her.

212
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,560
Yeah.

213
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,160
Do you guys want to come too? It's a nice place.

214
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,360
Yes, I'll go!

215
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,960
Then, I guess we'll accompany you all on our Beetle too!

216
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,960
Then, why don't you come with us?

217
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,560
You'd like to ride the camping car, wouldn't you?

218
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,360
Yes! I'd like to ride it!

219
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,460
Wow, fantastic! Super!

220
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,260
This sofa is so fluffy!

221
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,660
There's a TV here too!

222
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,060
There's a toilet and shower too!

223
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,460
It's like a hotel.

224
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,860
This is really something.

225
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,660
What is that sound...

226
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,260
Oops, sounds like it's started already!

227
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,860
Reiji!

228
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,560
Can you do what we did last year this time too?

229
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,660
Okay!

230
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,160
What?

231
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,460
Oh, the sunroof.

232
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,760
I'll hold you up, so would you like to take a look?

233
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,260
Can we see something?

234
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,060
You'll see!

235
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,260
See, look.

236
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,760
Fireworks! It's fireworks!

237
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,860
Hey, I wanna see too.

238
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,760
It's covered by the mountains and I can't see it anymore.

239
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,560
Okay, let's go back inside.

240
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,760
Okay.

241
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,860
Don't worry.

242
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,860
When we get to the top of the mountain,

243
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,860
you'll get to see it nice and clear!

244
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,960
Look out, Reiji!

245
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,360
What's wrong?

246
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,060
I ran over something that was on the road.

247
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,660
Hey, what do you mean something?

248
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,260
Don't tell me that...

249
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,380
Don't tell me that...

250
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,280
What the...

251
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,580
A wooden fence, wooden fence!

252
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,880
What the... It scared me out of my wits.

253
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,080
I thought it was Yasumi.

254
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,380
It seems to have decayed and fell from above.

255
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,780
So, let's hurry to the spot!

256
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,880
The fireworks might end soon.

257
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,280
Okay.

258
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,180
Wow! How pretty!

259
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,880
Tamaya!

260
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:08,480
This is indeed a great place to watch the fireworks!

261
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,380
Yes, we coincidentally found this place

262
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,380
when we camped here four years ago.

263
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,480
It's a place that not too many people know of yet!

264
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,680
But, since we'll graduate and start working,

265
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,180
I guess this will be the last time we'll be coming here together.

266
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,380
By the way, I wonder where Yasumi is.

267
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,880
There are bicycle tire marks here!

268
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,180
What?

269
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,880
By this broken fence.

270
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,480
Don't tell me she fell from there or something...

271
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,280
Don't be silly.

272
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,880
If so, we would've found her on the road on our way here!

273
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,980
But...

274
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,280
I'm sure that someone who recently came here

275
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,580
bumped into the fence with his bicycle and broke it!

276
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,580
I wonder.

277
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,380
Even Yasumi is not that much of a klutz.

278
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,580
But, I wonder where Yasumi disappeared to.

279
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,380
I was positive that she beat us to that spot.

280
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,880
Yes.

281
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,280
Is Yasumi a person who usually does things like that?

282
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,180
Yes, even last year she went there by bicycle before us

283
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,980
and boasted being the first one there.

284
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,780
I'm sure she went to get something to eat!

285
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,980
She's not you, Genta.

286
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,080
Hey, Fukuura!

287
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,180
What now?

288
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,680
She... she's there.

289
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,880
Yasumi.

290
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,580
-Yasumi? -Where?

291
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,280
The road.

292
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,380
In the middle of the road!

293
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,780
The victim is Ms. Yasumi Shirafuji, age 22,

294
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,280
a university student.

295
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,080
Judging from the wound on her head,

296
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,280
it seems she probably hit her head hard on something

297
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,480
and passed away.

298
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,480
You mean she fell to her death?

299
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,080
I believe so...

300
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,080
Is something wrong?

301
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,180
Well, she's bleeding so much and yet...

302
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,580
there is virtually no blood stains on the road.

303
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,580
You're right.

304
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,880
When is the estimated time of death?

305
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,180
Around 5:00 or 6:00 in the evening.

306
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:19,080
That's strange!

307
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,080
You guys again.

308
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,980
What's strange?

309
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,680
We came up this hill by car at night.

310
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,180
But nobody was lying on the road at that time!

311
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:35,180
We found Yasumi when we came back down by car after a while!

312
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:39,580
Just what do you mean? Will you give me more of the details?

313
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:44,180
Well, I brought the kids to a camping ground nearby,

314
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,180
and we happened to hit it off well with these people.

315
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,280
Then we decided to ride in their camping car

316
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,680
and come to this scenic spot to get a view of the fireworks.

317
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,780
You're friends of the victim, Yasumi?

318
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,780
Yeah.

319
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,280
When we went to see the fireworks and first passed by here,

320
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,080
the fireworks had already started so it was past 7pm.

321
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,380
Then, on our way back at about 9pm after the fireworks,

322
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,980
we found her.

323
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,380
Our friend Yasumi, who belonged to the same university club as us

324
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,080
lying here on the road!

325
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,180
Which means that when you passed here at after 7pm,

326
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,880
you really saw no one lying here?

327
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,780
Yeah, the only thing we saw was the wooden broken part of the fence.

328
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,880
A wooden fence?

329
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,880
See? There's a wooden fence on top of the mountain.

330
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,480
That's where we were watching the fireworks.

331
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,480
A part of the fence had broken off and fell to the road below

332
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,180
so I avoided it by slamming on the brakes.

333
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,880
I kind of hit it a bit though.

334
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,280
Was it really a wooden fence?

335
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,580
Of course.

336
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,480
Only when we got to the top,

337
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,380
it looked more like somebody had deliberately broken it than

338
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,280
as if it had naturally broken off.

339
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,280
I thought that

340
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,080
maybe Yasumi had gone through it with her bicycle

341
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,280
and fell off.

342
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,980
Bicycle?

343
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,480
A bicycle that we had in the camping car.

344
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,380
Since the bicycle was missing,

345
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,080
we decided to go up the mountain

346
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,780
to that spot to watch the fireworks and look for her at the same time.

347
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,280
She always liked to beat us to places too so...

348
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,480
But, I figured that if she did fall from the above,

349
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,380
we would find her bicycle or something on the road along the way,

350
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,480
so I didn't think much of it.

351
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,980
This is...

352
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,180
Let's go to the place

353
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,780
where you all say you watched the fireworks!

354
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:38,280
There are tire marks of a bicycle near the broken fence.

355
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,280
I wonder if she fell from here after all.

356
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,980
Didn't you notice any tire marks when you came here?

357
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,280
I did notice, but I didn't think that it there was any connection.

358
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,480
Inspector Megure!

359
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,880
What's up, Officer Takagi?

360
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,980
I found the bicycle!

361
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,880
It seems to have been stuck in the bushes

362
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,680
on the outer side of the guard rail!

363
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,580
Oh, is that right?

364
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,280
Let's verify it. Will you bring it here?

365
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,480
Yeah, no mistake about it!

366
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,980
That's the bicycle we had in camping car!

367
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,480
Okay, try matching the wheel mark then!

368
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,780
Yes, sir!

369
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,180
They seem to match!

370
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,180
I see. Which means...

371
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,280
Yasumi came here by bicycle before you all got here,

372
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,180
and because it was dark,

373
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,280
she stopped her bicycle a bit too late,

374
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,780
broke through the fence and fell over

375
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,480
hit her head somewhere on the road

376
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,280
and then rolled into the bush the bicycle was found in.

377
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,280
And, while you were all watching fireworks here,

378
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,980
Yasumi's body that was stuck somewhere in the bushes

379
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,580
slipped off to the road below.

380
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,180
Then, on your way back from the fireworks,

381
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,680
you happened to find her here.

382
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,280
This looks to be an accident.

383
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,680
Yes. Then the thing about no blood on the road

384
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,480
where she was found is understandable too.

385
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,780
I wonder about that.

386
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,880
Yasumi came here last year too, right?

387
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,780
She should've known about this open square as well as the fact

388
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,780
that there is a cliff on the other side of the fence too, right?

389
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,280
If so, I wonder why she crashed into the fence.

390
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,980
So, it was dark and she couldn't see the fence.

391
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,980
If it was dark, wouldn't she try to be even more careful?

392
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,180
She should've known it was dangerous, right?

393
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,280
Well...

394
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,280
Maybe she was happy that she was the first one here

395
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,980
and got carried away?

396
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,980
Right!

397
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,580
That's why she couldn't stop herself fast enough and fell over!

398
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,480
Then...

399
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,280
Oh, watch out, Conan!

400
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,580
If Yasumi fell from here,

401
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,980
there should be a place on the road below

402
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:51,980
where the blood stains of when she hit her are!

403
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,280
How about it, Officer Takagi?

404
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,380
Well, the shattered pieces of the broken light cover were found,

405
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,780
but no blood stains were found yet.

406
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,380
What did you say?

407
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,580
Inspector, could it be that Yasumi

408
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,780
did not fall to her death but rather...

409
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:11,280
Somebody deliberately left wheel tracks

410
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,380
and tried to make it look like an accident.

411
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,280
In other words, a homicide!

412
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,280
Which means that the killer is someone

413
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,480
who could freely take the bicycle from the camping car.

414
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,180
Yeah. Her friends who belong to the same circle.

415
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:29,780
The probability of the killer being among the three is high!

416
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,620
Next Conan's Hint:

417
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,680
"Belt"

418
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,220
The next episode is part two of this story.

419
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,840
Will Ayumi succeed in calling Haibara by her first name Ai?
