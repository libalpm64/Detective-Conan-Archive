1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,730
Liar.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,230
Thief.

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,030
Sonoko?

4
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:21,330
All the programs for today have ended.

5
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,130
Thank you very much for your patronage.

6
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,330
What's the matter, Sonoko?

7
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,630
You're the one who wanted to come to watch this thief movie, right?

8
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,330
But...

9
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,130
Part one was really good

10
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,330
so I expected this one to be even better.

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,930
But, they're just doing the same thing over again?

12
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,430
Talk about a meaningless part two!

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,230
I see. I kind of enjoyed it.

14
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,130
Kind of isn't good enough!

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,530
Well, most second editions are like that.

16
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,330
How I wish that somewhere,

17
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,030
an incident so incredible would make my heart beat so badly

18
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,330
that it would erase all the sounds around me!

19
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,230
Sonoko.

20
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:13,430
Come to think of it, I haven't seen that guy around recently.

21
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,930
Today's culprit is Thief Kid.

22
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,230
He may be able to deceive everyone else,

23
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,330
but I'm protecting the treasure and my dream.

24
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,930
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,730
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,730
His name is Detective Conan!

27
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,530
This is what I wanted to see.

28
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,830
Hey!

29
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,430
Wait up, you!

30
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,230
When you bump into people you're supposed to apologize!

31
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,830
Hey, Sonoko.

32
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,430
Sonoko, your bag...

33
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,930
-Mugged? -Mugged?

34
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,930
Sonoko, stay here!

35
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,130
Why should I listen to that glasses boy?

36
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,930
Hey, wait!

37
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,730
Go get him, Lupin!

38
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,030
Lupin?

39
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,330
Stop it.

40
00:03:18,445 --> 00:03:24,045
"Thief Kid's Wondrous Sky Walk"

41
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:26,245
That hurt.

42
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:30,945
How dare you snatch the bag of a fragile lady?

43
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:34,445
I'm going to write about you in a corner of my biography.

44
00:03:34,445 --> 00:03:35,945
That hurt.

45
00:03:36,945 --> 00:03:39,545
Hey, young lady, hurry and contact the police, please.

46
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:42,545
Yes. Thank you.

47
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:45,245
Thank you too, doggy.

48
00:03:45,945 --> 00:03:50,145
Well, even if Lupin here were to let him get away,

49
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:54,645
with my Ultra Classic 1500 cc Twin Cam model

50
00:03:54,645 --> 00:03:57,145
he could never have gotten away anyway.

51
00:03:57,145 --> 00:03:59,545
If the situation calls for it, I have a speed-up function

52
00:03:59,545 --> 00:04:01,844
rigged to this motorbike, too.

53
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,445
Uncle?

54
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:10,045
Aren't you Uncle Jirokichi?

55
00:04:11,745 --> 00:04:14,445
You're Shiro's daughter!

56
00:04:14,445 --> 00:04:17,044
The last time I saw you, was at the Seven-Five-Three Festival!

57
00:04:17,044 --> 00:04:18,645
They know each other?

58
00:04:18,645 --> 00:04:20,145
Looks to be so.

59
00:04:20,145 --> 00:04:22,745
He's my father's cousin

60
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:24,445
and advisor for the Suzuki Financial Group,

61
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:26,745
Uncle Jirokichi Suzuki.

62
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:28,645
How do you do?

63
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:31,445
But uncle, when did you come here?

64
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:35,045
I heard that you went out on a trip 6 months ago.

65
00:04:35,045 --> 00:04:37,145
I just got back last week.

66
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:40,145
I went the world over and finally found it

67
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:42,445
so I came back.

68
00:04:42,445 --> 00:04:44,645
The best bait in the world.

69
00:04:44,645 --> 00:04:45,945
Bait?

70
00:04:45,945 --> 00:04:47,244
-Bait? -Bait?

71
00:04:50,744 --> 00:04:53,244
There are so many medals and trophies here!

72
00:04:53,244 --> 00:04:57,445
The European Golf Open, the US Cup yacht race

73
00:04:57,445 --> 00:05:00,345
and worldwide fast hamburger eater contest!

74
00:05:00,345 --> 00:05:02,645
And, all of them are the first prize.

75
00:05:02,645 --> 00:05:06,645
Amazing. This old man's won the Savanna Rally, too.

76
00:05:06,645 --> 00:05:08,245
Check this one out!

77
00:05:08,245 --> 00:05:11,445
Around the world on a man-powered plane.

78
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,545
The pastime of a rich man.

79
00:05:15,645 --> 00:05:17,945
Was this statue here from before?

80
00:05:17,945 --> 00:05:22,145
Yes, it's the Golden Goddess that was decorated

81
00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:25,745
on the bow of the Sea Goddess

82
00:05:25,745 --> 00:05:28,445
during the Grand Navigation Era

83
00:05:28,445 --> 00:05:30,645
when the pirates used to raid ships.

84
00:05:30,645 --> 00:05:32,945
That thing that she is holding up in her right hand

85
00:05:32,945 --> 00:05:35,345
is the legendary aquamarine,

86
00:05:35,345 --> 00:05:37,145
which is said to have turned

87
00:05:37,145 --> 00:05:38,345
into a gemstone from the tears of a mermaid.

88
00:05:38,345 --> 00:05:40,244
It has the power to prevent disasters at sea

89
00:05:40,244 --> 00:05:42,744
and is known as the miracle of the ocean,

90
00:05:42,744 --> 00:05:44,145
Blue Wonder!

91
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,645
It is valued very highly as an artistic work

92
00:05:48,645 --> 00:05:51,244
and I had a hell of a time bidding it off.

93
00:05:51,244 --> 00:05:53,545
I finally got hold of it last week.

94
00:05:53,545 --> 00:05:56,145
Then, don't tell me that this is the bait that you mentioned

95
00:05:56,145 --> 00:05:59,744
-just a while ago? -Exactly, this is the bait.

96
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:02,245
To fish that guy!

97
00:06:04,545 --> 00:06:05,945
Fish what guy?

98
00:06:05,945 --> 00:06:09,145
It's been 72 years since I've come to this world

99
00:06:09,145 --> 00:06:11,445
and there is not one time that I, Jirokichi,

100
00:06:11,445 --> 00:06:13,345
has ever let prey go in my life.

101
00:06:13,345 --> 00:06:16,445
Yes. I've gotten every award that I've gone after

102
00:06:16,445 --> 00:06:19,045
and realized every dream that I've ever had.

103
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,245
But, there is just one thing in this world

104
00:06:21,245 --> 00:06:23,945
that I just couldn't get a hold of.

105
00:06:23,945 --> 00:06:26,945
That guy slips through the tightest security

106
00:06:26,945 --> 00:06:28,345
and the most armored vaults.

107
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:31,445
He is a white sinner who magically breaks through everything in his way

108
00:06:31,445 --> 00:06:33,545
and spreads his wings gracefully,

109
00:06:33,545 --> 00:06:35,145
flying off into the night sky.

110
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:37,845
Hey, wait a minute.

111
00:06:37,845 --> 00:06:39,545
Don't tell me that you're referring to...

112
00:06:39,545 --> 00:06:42,045
Yes. His name is...

113
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:44,945
"Mouri Detective Agency" -The Thief Kid?

114
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:46,645
"Making a declaration to the Thief Kid.

115
00:06:46,645 --> 00:06:48,744
The big jewel that you so desire,

116
00:06:48,744 --> 00:06:50,945
the miracle of the ocean, Blue Wonder,

117
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:55,545
has been placed on the roof of the Great Museum in Shiodome.

118
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:58,744
If you want it, come and get it.

119
00:06:58,744 --> 00:07:01,745
Advisor for the Suzuki Financial Group, Jirokichi Suzuki."

120
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:07,745
To declare something like this on the front pages of the papers.

121
00:07:07,745 --> 00:07:10,445
Rich people sure are something.

122
00:07:10,445 --> 00:07:12,845
But, it's a bit exciting.

123
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:15,545
You idiot. He won't show up.

124
00:07:15,545 --> 00:07:17,845
A super-rich dude is sending out

125
00:07:17,845 --> 00:07:21,045
a challenging demand like this full of confidence.

126
00:07:21,045 --> 00:07:23,245
Who in the world would fly right into a trap

127
00:07:23,245 --> 00:07:25,445
that is so well set up?

128
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,145
Exactly.

129
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:29,545
But, Sonoko was saying that just a while ago,

130
00:07:29,545 --> 00:07:31,845
her Uncle Jirokichi got an okay mail

131
00:07:31,845 --> 00:07:34,645
from the Thief Kid on his cell phone.

132
00:07:34,645 --> 00:07:35,845
Okay?

133
00:07:35,845 --> 00:07:37,645
What?

134
00:07:37,645 --> 00:07:39,545
It seems that he's going to come

135
00:07:39,545 --> 00:07:41,244
to check the place out this Saturday or something.

136
00:07:41,244 --> 00:07:43,645
See, here's that mail.

137
00:07:43,645 --> 00:07:46,744
She forwarded it to my cell phone, too.

138
00:07:46,744 --> 00:07:47,845
Let me see.

139
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:52,244
"I shall respond to your challenge.

140
00:07:52,244 --> 00:07:55,244
I will go to get what I want on April 12th at 20:00.

141
00:07:55,244 --> 00:07:56,345
However, please forgive me

142
00:07:56,345 --> 00:07:58,945
for going to check the place out on the night before.

143
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,244
Thief Kid."

144
00:08:00,244 --> 00:08:01,245
"P.S."

145
00:08:01,245 --> 00:08:04,245
He sure has a way of putting on airs like always.

146
00:08:04,245 --> 00:08:07,645
What's the P.S. after the mail?

147
00:08:07,645 --> 00:08:09,345
Post script?

148
00:08:09,345 --> 00:08:14,345
Just as the name has it, I shall walk over and appear.

149
00:08:14,345 --> 00:08:16,645
He's going to walk over?

150
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:31,501
Just what're you doing?

151
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:33,301
Never mind. Get on with the check, go ahead and check!

152
00:08:33,301 --> 00:08:35,201
Make sure that all the roads leading to this museum are blocked

153
00:08:35,201 --> 00:08:36,401
and officers are standing guard.

154
00:08:36,401 --> 00:08:40,101
Don't let one suspicious thing get through! Understand?

155
00:08:42,601 --> 00:08:45,701
Gosh! Those choppers sure are noisy.

156
00:08:46,201 --> 00:08:50,901
What? You don't know how you should identify the Thief Kid?

157
00:08:51,901 --> 00:08:55,101
Pull on his face! His face, get that?

158
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:58,001
Inspector.

159
00:08:58,001 --> 00:08:59,201
Don't pull softly.

160
00:08:59,201 --> 00:09:01,501
But, strongly!

161
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:04,401
Firm and tight. Understand?

162
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:08,901
Inspector Nakamori is really into this.

163
00:09:08,901 --> 00:09:10,901
Hey, Ran!

164
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:14,601
Sonoko.

165
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:17,001
Ran!

166
00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:19,401
What a flashy appearance.

167
00:09:21,401 --> 00:09:24,301
Did Thief Kid appear already?

168
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:26,701
No, not yet.

169
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:33,101
This man with the slight mustache is Ran's father,

170
00:09:33,101 --> 00:09:34,701
the Sleeping Kogoro.

171
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:36,101
Slight mustache?

172
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:39,301
I've heard a lot of rumors about you.

173
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:41,801
Is that so?

174
00:09:41,801 --> 00:09:43,701
Hey! Are you the one?

175
00:09:43,701 --> 00:09:46,301
Who started this riot to begin with?

176
00:09:46,301 --> 00:09:47,301
What?

177
00:09:47,301 --> 00:09:50,201
Do something about your helicopters up there!

178
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:55,101
They're in getting in the way of the police choppers!

179
00:09:55,101 --> 00:09:57,501
There's no need for police choppers, is there?

180
00:09:57,501 --> 00:10:01,001
The Thief Kid announced he was going to walk over here after all.

181
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:05,301
Then, why do you have so many helicopters up there like that?

182
00:10:05,301 --> 00:10:09,101
Those helicopters are up there to film my autobiography.

183
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:12,001
Film an autobiography?

184
00:10:14,901 --> 00:10:17,301
Amazing.

185
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:20,101
It's like an outside broadcast van of the TV station.

186
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:22,501
The helicopters aren't the only ones shooting the film.

187
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:25,101
All the images that are filmed by the cameras

188
00:10:25,101 --> 00:10:28,901
that are set in 100 places all over the museum can be viewed here.

189
00:10:28,901 --> 00:10:32,901
Hey. There's nobody inside the museum.

190
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:36,701
There were too many up to now.

191
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:38,901
Since there's nobody there, even if he were to disguise himself

192
00:10:38,901 --> 00:10:40,401
and sneak in there,

193
00:10:40,401 --> 00:10:42,401
it would be plain for all to see, right?

194
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:45,301
Since it's possible to open and lock

195
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:47,601
all the doors of the museum from here

196
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:51,601
even if he were to get to the roof where the Golden Goddess is,

197
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:54,201
the most that he'll end up doing is get locked up.

198
00:10:55,301 --> 00:10:59,401
That is if he shows up just as he said he would.

199
00:11:03,201 --> 00:11:04,501
I think he's here.

200
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:05,501
What?

201
00:11:05,501 --> 00:11:07,901
Where?

202
00:11:10,701 --> 00:11:13,701
Can't we get a larger view?

203
00:11:13,701 --> 00:11:16,101
Over here. Right here.

204
00:11:16,101 --> 00:11:19,101
-Hurry it up! -Yes, sir.

205
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:29,101
So, he's appeared.

206
00:11:29,101 --> 00:11:30,201
Thief...

207
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:32,001
Thief Kid!

208
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:34,601
Hey! Which one is it?

209
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:37,501
Which helicopter is the image coming from?

210
00:11:37,501 --> 00:11:39,501
Which helicopter is shooting the film?

211
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:41,201
Helicopter number 7, sir!

212
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,801
From behind the museum, I think.

213
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:45,901
Behind the museum?

214
00:11:45,901 --> 00:11:46,901
Okay!

215
00:11:46,901 --> 00:11:48,401
In the back?

216
00:11:49,601 --> 00:11:51,001
Conan?

217
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,301
What shall we do?

218
00:11:52,301 --> 00:11:56,201
Shall we move the Golden Goddess inside using that device, just in case.

219
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:58,201
Come on. Cool it.

220
00:11:58,201 --> 00:12:00,001
He's just checking the place out tonight.

221
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:01,301
He won't steal it yet.

222
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:04,701
Besides, he announced he'd come on foot.

223
00:12:04,701 --> 00:12:08,001
Hey, move it!

224
00:12:08,001 --> 00:12:09,501
Outta the way!

225
00:12:09,501 --> 00:12:11,601
Let's watch how the great thief,

226
00:12:11,601 --> 00:12:13,601
the so-called illusionist under the moonlight

227
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:15,801
will make his appearance.

228
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:24,401
Hey! Where is the Thief Kid?

229
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:27,201
Well, after he went across between the buildings,

230
00:12:27,201 --> 00:12:28,401
he hasn't come out.

231
00:12:28,401 --> 00:12:31,701
Come on out. Thief Kid.

232
00:12:32,901 --> 00:12:35,901
You can't walk unless you come down on the ground.

233
00:12:35,901 --> 00:12:38,701
Come on out, Thief Kid.

234
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,401
What the...

235
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,601
No way! No way.

236
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:11,001
Darling Thief Kid, he's floating in the air.

237
00:13:11,001 --> 00:13:12,201
Fantastic!

238
00:13:16,801 --> 00:13:19,901
No way! How can this be?

239
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:22,701
How is he defying gravity...

240
00:13:25,701 --> 00:13:28,201
and floating in the midair?

241
00:13:39,088 --> 00:13:42,288
Don't be deceived! This is a trick!

242
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,688
Thief Kid is just riding a black blimp

243
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:48,588
or something with his body suspended in the air with a wire.

244
00:13:48,588 --> 00:13:52,588
Any helicopters that are nearby, film his head and confirm!

245
00:13:55,488 --> 00:13:57,388
Chopper no.7 here.

246
00:13:57,388 --> 00:13:58,988
There's nothing above Thief Kid's head.

247
00:13:58,988 --> 00:14:00,488
What?

248
00:14:00,488 --> 00:14:02,888
Thief Kid sure is amazing.

249
00:14:02,888 --> 00:14:05,588
-Don't you think so, Ran? -Yes.

250
00:14:08,588 --> 00:14:10,088
Chopper no.7 here.

251
00:14:10,088 --> 00:14:11,488
What shall we do?

252
00:14:11,488 --> 00:14:13,188
Don't move from there for a while.

253
00:14:13,188 --> 00:14:14,288
Roger!

254
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:17,688
That Thief Kid, just what kind of trick is he using anyway?

255
00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:19,088
There's no way he can float like that.

256
00:14:19,088 --> 00:14:20,988
Look for the rope.

257
00:14:24,188 --> 00:14:27,688
Already making such a big fuss. The show's just begun.

258
00:14:27,688 --> 00:14:29,488
If he's not up there...

259
00:14:29,488 --> 00:14:31,688
The side? I get it.

260
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:33,288
The wire is hooked on to the buildings on both sides

261
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:34,888
and he's suspending himself with it.

262
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:36,688
Okay. I'll go to the building on the left,

263
00:14:36,688 --> 00:14:38,688
so you go to the one on the right

264
00:14:38,688 --> 00:14:40,288
and look for the wire on the roof!

265
00:14:40,288 --> 00:14:41,288
Yes, sir!

266
00:14:41,688 --> 00:14:43,388
Darn.

267
00:14:43,388 --> 00:14:46,688
That Thief Kid, how dare he play around with us like this?

268
00:14:50,988 --> 00:14:53,388
It's nothing more than magic, plain illusion.

269
00:14:53,388 --> 00:14:55,388
Just you wait, Thief Kid.

270
00:14:55,388 --> 00:14:57,488
All I have to do is see through your trick...

271
00:14:58,288 --> 00:15:02,188
Nothing? There's no wire anywhere?

272
00:15:02,188 --> 00:15:03,788
There's nothing here!

273
00:15:03,788 --> 00:15:05,188
There's no wire anywhere.

274
00:15:06,188 --> 00:15:07,788
Inspector Nakamori!

275
00:15:07,788 --> 00:15:10,288
There's nothing on this side of the building either.

276
00:15:10,288 --> 00:15:13,988
It can't be. Then, how is he up there?

277
00:15:13,988 --> 00:15:16,188
How is he floating in the air?

278
00:15:18,488 --> 00:15:22,388
Ladies and gentlemen!

279
00:15:27,988 --> 00:15:30,388
So, on this day, before my actual feat will be carried out,

280
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,088
please watch to your heart's content

281
00:15:32,088 --> 00:15:33,788
the miracle that my legs will perform.

282
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:38,588
He's walking...

283
00:15:41,088 --> 00:15:43,088
He's walking?

284
00:15:44,988 --> 00:15:47,888
Amazing, he's walking.

285
00:15:52,788 --> 00:15:55,688
This is chopper no.3, Thief Kid is still walking in the air.

286
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,088
It can't be. What kind of trick is he using anyway?

287
00:16:09,588 --> 00:16:13,688
Hang on. My darling Thief Kid is walking?

288
00:16:13,688 --> 00:16:15,088
Amazing.

289
00:16:15,088 --> 00:16:16,188
I see.

290
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:17,388
So that's what he meant by

291
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:19,488
he'll come on foot to get his target.

292
00:16:19,488 --> 00:16:22,888
Detective Mouri, never mind that,

293
00:16:22,888 --> 00:16:25,188
but please tell me how is he performing this feat

294
00:16:25,188 --> 00:16:26,888
that goes against all laws of nature.

295
00:16:26,888 --> 00:16:28,288
This is chopper no.3.

296
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:31,488
Thief Kid is now walking over the skies of Shiodome Park.

297
00:16:31,488 --> 00:16:33,488
If he goes on as is,

298
00:16:33,488 --> 00:16:35,888
he will reach the roof of the Suzuki Museum

299
00:16:35,888 --> 00:16:38,088
where the Blue Wonder is in less than a minute.

300
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:52,988
Thief Kid will reach the Blue Wonder in a few seconds.

301
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,088
Uncle.

302
00:16:58,388 --> 00:16:59,488
You mean we can't do a thing

303
00:16:59,488 --> 00:17:01,088
but just watch him steal the stuff right before our eyes?

304
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:03,388
Darn. That Thief Kid.

305
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:05,888
How is he planning to flee,

306
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:09,188
when there are police officers on the ground and choppers in the air?

307
00:17:09,188 --> 00:17:12,988
Advisor, don't you think it's time we start the device?

308
00:17:14,488 --> 00:17:16,588
We've got no choice.

309
00:17:28,988 --> 00:17:31,988
So, this will be all for the show the night before.

310
00:17:31,988 --> 00:17:35,788
I will see you again tomorrow at 20:00 at the same place.

311
00:17:39,388 --> 00:17:40,688
Darn.

312
00:17:41,588 --> 00:17:44,588
Didn't I tell you that you're going to be sorry

313
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:46,288
if you underestimate Thief Kid?

314
00:17:46,288 --> 00:17:48,888
I won't let him steal it.

315
00:17:48,888 --> 00:17:52,388
Because I went all over the world to look for it

316
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:56,488
and finally got hold of the "Miracle of the Ocean", Blue Wonder.

317
00:17:56,588 --> 00:18:00,588
Why is the golden statue inside and upside down?

318
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:02,688
This is how it's rigged.

319
00:18:10,688 --> 00:18:11,988
I see.

320
00:18:11,988 --> 00:18:15,988
It rotates so the real one is exchanged for the fake.

321
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:19,688
Thief Kid will see through a childish thing like this right away.

322
00:18:19,688 --> 00:18:24,088
Of course I don't intend to deceive him with something like this.

323
00:18:24,088 --> 00:18:27,088
If so, leave everything to the police tomorrow

324
00:18:27,088 --> 00:18:28,588
and keep your helicopters from flying.

325
00:18:28,588 --> 00:18:30,688
Stay put and stay still.

326
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:32,488
I'm doing just the opposite.

327
00:18:32,488 --> 00:18:33,888
The opposite?

328
00:18:33,888 --> 00:18:38,088
He vanished saying let's meet at the same place tomorrow night.

329
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:40,588
If he so wishes, I will do exactly that and ambush him.

330
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:44,688
What do you mean by ambushing him?

331
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:48,488
I'm going to rent practically all the buildings in this area

332
00:18:48,488 --> 00:18:50,188
and be prepared for him with a helicopter squad

333
00:18:50,188 --> 00:18:52,288
and security guard unit even greater than tonight.

334
00:18:52,288 --> 00:18:55,388
I don't know what kind of trick he's using to walk floating in the air,

335
00:18:55,388 --> 00:18:58,688
but if he dares come out again, I'm going to nab him

336
00:18:58,688 --> 00:19:00,888
and add him on to the final episode of my autobiography.

337
00:19:03,688 --> 00:19:06,188
Don't move. Don't move.

338
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,888
Stay still!

339
00:19:08,888 --> 00:19:11,088
What's happened?

340
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:12,488
Never mind and just don't move!

341
00:19:12,488 --> 00:19:16,288
If you move, you'll never walk before me again!

342
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,888
Where? Where is it?

343
00:19:18,888 --> 00:19:19,988
Don't you dare move.

344
00:19:25,688 --> 00:19:26,888
There it is!

345
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:28,688
What's with this dog?

346
00:19:30,188 --> 00:19:31,588
Just as expected of Lupin.

347
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:34,388
He will never let a prey that he is after go.

348
00:19:35,388 --> 00:19:36,788
Contacts?

349
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:39,888
I didn't know your eyes were bad, Uncle Jirokichi?

350
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:43,088
Well, at 72 years, all parts of my body

351
00:19:43,088 --> 00:19:45,688
are refusing to work the way they should.

352
00:19:45,688 --> 00:19:48,188
Your body seems to be working just fine.

353
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:51,288
I would at least like to nab him while I'm still alive and kicking.

354
00:19:51,288 --> 00:19:54,588
What makes you want to pursue Thief Kid as much as you do?

355
00:19:54,588 --> 00:19:56,588
Kid, Thief Kid.

356
00:19:56,588 --> 00:19:58,188
The sound of that name itself,

357
00:19:58,188 --> 00:20:00,788
the one who stole everything from me, that Thief Kid.

358
00:20:00,788 --> 00:20:03,388
I'll never forgive him.

359
00:20:03,388 --> 00:20:07,288
Listen, I, Jirokichi Suzuki will nab him!

360
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:09,088
I won't let anyone get in my way!

361
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:12,188
I won't let you have your way, Kid. Just you watch!

362
00:20:12,188 --> 00:20:15,188
I promise, I swear.

363
00:20:16,188 --> 00:20:19,088
You've already seen the many honorary gifts

364
00:20:19,088 --> 00:20:20,788
and awards I have won so far.

365
00:20:20,788 --> 00:20:24,388
They've always covered the headlines of the papers.

366
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:26,488
All except for one time.

367
00:20:26,488 --> 00:20:28,088
Don't tell me that's why you're going after him?

368
00:20:28,088 --> 00:20:29,288
Yes, exactly!

369
00:20:29,288 --> 00:20:31,288
That Thief Kid not only stole the headline from me,

370
00:20:31,288 --> 00:20:32,888
he also stole the 2nd page from me!

371
00:20:32,888 --> 00:20:35,788
My article of having flown the world over on a manned plane

372
00:20:35,788 --> 00:20:38,688
was pushed over to a corner on the 3rd page because of him!

373
00:20:38,688 --> 00:20:40,888
Do you understand how humiliated I felt?

374
00:20:40,888 --> 00:20:43,688
Can you understand how sad I felt?

375
00:20:43,688 --> 00:20:45,688
A bit, I guess.

376
00:20:45,688 --> 00:20:47,788
When I do get my hands on him,

377
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:52,088
I, Jirokichi Suzuki, will be on the front page once again!

378
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,580
Really look at the huge number of helicopters.

379
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,680
More than the helicopters, the number of onlookers here

380
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,380
is even more surprising.

381
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,780
They should've put up a "Keep out" sign.

382
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,180
Uncle had them come in deliberately

383
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,180
because he wanted the arrest scene of the Thief Kid

384
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,480
to be complemented by genuine extras.

385
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,780
Come to think of it, the advertisement for introducing

386
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,580
that large museum as well as the special program

387
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,680
was really flashy and filmed from the air.

388
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,380
But, wouldn't it be difficult

389
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,680
to find Thief Kid among this large crowd?

390
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,180
Don't worry, he has special seats reserved for us.

391
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,680
Ms. Sonoko Suzuki, we've been waiting for you.

392
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,880
Thank you.

393
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,380
Please follow me, everyone to the seat over that way.

394
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,480
Hey, is this for real?

395
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,680
This is the roof.

396
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,680
Would you like anything to drink?

397
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,980
We'll leave it up to you.

398
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,680
For the first time, she kind of looks like a rich little lady.

399
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,780
This certainly is the roof of the building

400
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,880
near the building where Thief Kid appeared,

401
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,480
because the only ones here beside us are the security guards.

402
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,580
I still don't understand.

403
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,980
I looked through the image the helicopter sent afterwards,

404
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,680
but there was nothing strange in it.

405
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,680
Moreover, he vanished in midair.

406
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,380
Just how on earth did he do it?

407
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,080
I'll go get it.

408
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,580
I'm sorry!

409
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,080
A scratch? It seems like something got stuck here.

410
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,480
And it's still new.

411
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,780
Do you see what I see?

412
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,780
A multitude of helicopters practically covered the entire sky.

413
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,680
And look at the many security guards that are positioned

414
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,380
all through the vicinity.

415
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,380
This is indeed a handpicked unit of security guards

416
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,980
that the Suzuki Financial Group has gotten together

417
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,480
to maintain their prestige.

418
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,280
Will he really appears under such tight security?

419
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,180
The one who forewarned that he would steal Blue Wonder

420
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,380
that is decorated on the roof of the great Suzuki Museum.

421
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,380
The Thief Kid!

422
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,180
He'll come. Of course, he'll come.

423
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,280
It sure doesn't sound like a remark that would come out

424
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,680
of the mouth of a little lady of the Suzuki Financial Group

425
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,780
whose treasure is the target of theft.

426
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,280
But, he's the Thief Kid, you know.

427
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,580
If just this once, I'd sure like to see him in person.

428
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:08,280
I actually wanted to hold the Golden Goddess statue

429
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,280
with a lot of gemstones on it that is on the roof,

430
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,980
but Uncle Jirokichi wouldn't let me.

431
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,380
Of course he wouldn't let you.

432
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,180
Don't tell me you wished

433
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,580
that he would take you away with him, gemstones and all?

434
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,880
Right, exactly, and Makoto would come to rescue me,

435
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,880
who is being held captive.

436
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,880
I, Sonoko wouldn't know what to do with two men fighting over me.

437
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,280
I guess

438
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,580
all this abnormal security around here can't be helped.

439
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,880
After all he declares that he is coming to check the place out last night

440
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,080
and appears by the building right beside this one floating in midair.

441
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,080
He walks in midair and closes in on the museum.

442
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,180
Then, he suddenly vanishes.

443
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,180
I guess it's understandable,

444
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,980
since he is the great thief that they are all trying to arrest.

445
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,680
Really, he was walking in midair

446
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,480
as though there were no tricks involved.

447
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,680
I'm sure that there are tricks and magic involved.

448
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,680
Because if people can so easily walk in midair,

449
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,180
it would surprise the birdies, right?

450
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,480
-Birdies, he says. -Oh, my.

451
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,780
What a cute thing to say, Conan.

452
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,780
Maybe the remark was a bit too childish.

453
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,080
Brat, let Thief Kid's magic surprise you and the birdies.

454
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,380
I don't know what trick he used yet,

455
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,680
but we may found the marks that he left behind

456
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,580
when he set up the trick.

457
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,780
See! The scratch on the wall over there

458
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,980
looks as if something was hooked on!

459
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,180
The scratch is still new

460
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,580
so it could be something that Thief Kid left behind.

461
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,380
Well?

462
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,180
There's one over that side, too?

463
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,180
Are you sure that there's a mark

464
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,780
that looks similar on the building on your side, too?

465
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,480
Yes, a brand new scratch.

466
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,680
But, I wonder what the mark is?

467
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,180
Maybe he hooked a wire up from this building to the other?

468
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,580
Thief Kid probably did so to put people under the illusion

469
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,380
that he was floating in midair.

470
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,780
No way.

471
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:01,780
Inspector Nakamori who climbed the other building last night said

472
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:05,280
that there were no wires or anything like that.

473
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,680
Besides, if he's suspended from something like that,

474
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,180
he wouldn't be able to walk.

475
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,280
Right.

476
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,080
Hey, maybe he set up a device to project a 3-D image?

477
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,380
And, that's what left the traces?

478
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,780
See, if he projected from two sides, this side and that side.

479
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,180
Impossible. He couldn't have done something like that

480
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,780
with the technique of this day and age.

481
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:26,680
It's impossible to project such a clear moving 3-D image

482
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,780
in a space where there's nothing.

483
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,480
Then, do you know how he carried out the trick, dad?

484
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,780
Sort of.

485
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,380
What kind of trick did he use?

486
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:39,080
When people think that something is not there,

487
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,180
they have a way of not being able to see it

488
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,680
because of the influence of preconceived ideas, even if it's there.

489
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,880
-Preconceived ideas? -Preconceived ideas?

490
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,880
And?

491
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,980
Just what is that something supposed to be?

492
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,080
Well, for example...

493
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,580
A super huge hard glass.

494
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:58,780
He placed it over one building to the other and walked on it.

495
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,080
Inspector Nakamori probably didn't notice it

496
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,280
because he didn't think that the glass was there.

497
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,480
It could be that the scratch was made when the equipment

498
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,780
that held the glass in place was removed.

499
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,780
If such a glass were there, somebody is bound to have seen it.

500
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,080
That's why I said...

501
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,480
In the first place, how would he have brought something

502
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,580
as large as that along, and then put it away as well?

503
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,080
That's why I said it could be that.

504
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,680
Not being able to see it because of preconceived ideas?

505
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,780
Kid...

506
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,280
Inspector Nakamori, so many people are flowing in

507
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,080
that it's impossible to keep checking them!

508
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,480
It seems that the Suzuki Financial Group

509
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,380
passed out a leaflet saying, "Welcome fans of Thief Kid".

510
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,080
Passed out leaflets?

511
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,680
If things are left as is, a riot may break out.

512
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,680
It can't be helped, let them through without checking them!

513
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,780
Roger!

514
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,380
He's probably going to come from the sky anyway.

515
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,680
Darn! The security structure of the police is a mess,

516
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,380
thanks to that attention-craving old man.

517
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,880
You're the owner of the Miracle of the Ocean, Blue Wonder,

518
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,180
the advisor for the Suzuki Financial Group, Jirokichi Suzuki, aren't you?

519
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,880
Indeed.

520
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,380
It's an hour more to go before the time declared by Thief Kid,

521
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,180
but are you more than prepared to take him on?

522
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,480
It seems that he put on a cheap magic show last night,

523
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,280
but tonight I shall be the one to put on a show.

524
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,180
I'll show you all a dramatical arrest

525
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,280
that will make Hollywood movies look like child's play!

526
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,480
Gee, my uncle is really out for the kill!

527
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,580
Let's take a short commercial break then.

528
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,180
The new talk of the town that has opened in Shiodome,

529
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,180
bringing along with it the fragrance of history and culture

530
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,380
is the Great Suzuki Museum.

531
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,780
Hey, even the commercial is about the museum?

532
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,780
It's a tie-up, you know? A tie-up.

533
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,080
Uncle never misses chances like these.

534
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,280
Even this aerial film

535
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,580
is a cut and paste of what he used in the special program.

536
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,480
Though he may not look it, he's quite thrifty.

537
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,580
Please come quickly, my dear Thief Kid.

538
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,780
And please steal my passionate heart away.

539
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,480
What's the use seeing him in a noisy place like this?

540
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,280
Besides, the wind's so strong, too.

541
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,680
Wind?

542
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,780
What's the matter?

543
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:03,380
I'm going over to where Uncle Jirokichi is for a while.

544
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,680
I just realized something interesting!

545
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,680
Just what is that interesting thing?

546
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,780
It's a secret!

547
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:14,780
What? Show you the film of yesterday's Thief Kid again?

548
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:18,880
Yes, Uncle Mouri insisted that I look at it no matter what.

549
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,180
Sonny, you watched it more than enough last night, didn't you?

550
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,480
Besides, it's already been sent to the staff

551
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,880
that are making his autobiographic movie.

552
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,180
What?

553
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,480
Well, but the film will eventually

554
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,380
be submitted to the police afterwards.

555
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,780
After all, Thief Kid has never come to check any place out

556
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,280
like he did last night, ever before in the past.

557
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,180
Come to think of it, he's right.

558
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,680
I wonder why Thief Kid put on such a demonstration?

559
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,380
It's less than a minute to go before the time declared by Thief Kid.

560
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,980
The Thief Kid fans who have gathered here are starting to countdown.

561
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,380
Let's all watch this miraculous moment, too.

562
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,080
He won't come.

563
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,280
No magician would ever let any viewer up on stage

564
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,880
before the show starts and let them surround him.

565
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,980
Because he would be revealing the secret of his trick that way.

566
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,380
Although he declared that he would appear again tonight

567
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,880
between those two buildings,

568
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,680
where the eyes of all the spectators are on him

569
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,180
and the wind of the helicopters

570
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:22,580
are going to blow his hand glider out of control.

571
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,780
He will not appear!

572
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,580
Well, if he's a long-nosed goblin or a mountain hermit,

573
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,680
it may be a different story.

574
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,580
-Thief Kid! -Thief Kid!

575
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,010
It's Thief Kid.

576
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:57,510
He's appeared just now, as he has declared he would!

577
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,910
Thief Kid!

578
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,310
He's come.

579
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,910
He's really floating in midair?

580
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,210
It... it can't be.

581
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:07,010
How and where on earth did he appear from?

582
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,310
Oh, no. It's started to rain.

583
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,510
Cover the equipment!

584
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,510
Rain?

585
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,710
Oh, no. It's raining.

586
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,710
What a time to rain.

587
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,310
Despite the sudden rain,

588
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,110
the call for Thief Kid goes on!

589
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,510
Hey, what's the matter? Chopper no.7, hey?

590
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,710
What is it?

591
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:30,810
The image from chopper no.7 was suddenly cut off.

592
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:34,010
This is chopper no.7. Everything's under control here.

593
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:38,110
The image probably temporarily went static due to the rain.

594
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,410
No. Maybe Thief Kid

595
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,410
is making one of his henchmen send out jamming waves,

596
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,410
and is up to something again.

597
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,710
Does Thief Kid have henchmen?

598
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,610
Yes.

599
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,710
It is reported to be an aged man or a young lady

600
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,910
or a lot of other characters.

601
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,810
But it's certain that he has at least one person helping him.

602
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,610
Hey, can you hear me, all men in the vicinity?

603
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,710
This is Inspector Nakamori!

604
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:02,910
Check on the double if there is anyone among the crowd

605
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,310
that is holding a jamming device!

606
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:07,310
That person may be Thief Kid's henchman!

607
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,410
He's walking!

608
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:12,010
Just like last night, Thief Kid has begun walking!

609
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,310
Advisor, please tell us what to do.

610
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:17,210
If things are left as is, he will surely steal the object this time!

611
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,010
I'm not going to let him steal anything right before my eyes.

612
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,810
Put the Blue Wonder inside for now!

613
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:23,810
Yes, sir.

614
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:26,310
It's his intelligence against mine.

615
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,910
Scratch, preconceived ideas,

616
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,110
wind.

617
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,610
Henchman.

618
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,110
I see. That's the story.

619
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,210
I've figured it out, Thief Kid.

620
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,910
The trick that you used to appear in midair, walk and vanish.

621
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:47,610
I've also figured out how you plan to steal Blue Wonder now, too.

622
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,510
Advisor,

623
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,910
we've completed putting Blue Wonder back inside the museum!

624
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,510
Okay, we're taking the initiative from here.

625
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:58,910
Turn off all the lights inside the museum right away!

626
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,310
All the lights?

627
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,410
Yes.

628
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:07,410
He could be monitoring the image within the museum, right?

629
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,410
Hey, doing something like that

630
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,610
is just what Thief Kid would love you to do.

631
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:14,610
Then, Inspector Nakamori, do you have a better idea?

632
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:17,610
Do you know how to stop the great thief

633
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,510
who has appeared out of nowhere as would a mountain hermit,

634
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:23,710
and close in on us walking in midair?

635
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:27,510
But just what do you plan to do turning off the lights of the museum

636
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,910
and taking the treasure inside?

637
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:32,510
In other words, the point is preventing him from stealing it.

638
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,710
If the Miracle of the Ocean, Blue Wonder

639
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:38,210
stays out of his reach, I win.

640
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,810
I'd like to make a proposal.

641
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:42,310
In exchange for giving you complete command of this situation,

642
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:46,110
I would like you to lend me a few of your men who can be trusted.

643
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,610
My men?

644
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,310
I'm accepting his challenge.

645
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:52,910
It's a secret strategy that I stayed up all night thinking up.

646
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:55,010
My dear Thief Kid!

647
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:58,910
My dear Thief Kid, my dear Thief Kid!

648
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,210
The helicopters have finally gone to the other side

649
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:03,110
giving me a good view of him, and with the wind out of my way,

650
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,810
I get an even better view.

651
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,810
But too bad he's so far away.

652
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,710
What the...

653
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:14,610
Thief Kid's less than 100 meters from his object of target Blue Wonder.

654
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:17,410
Hey, how're things on your side?

655
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,410
Perfect.

656
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:22,610
I'm sure that your strategy will outfox Thief Kid.

657
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,710
He may be wiretapping us,

658
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,510
so that's enough.

659
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,410
There's nothing to worry about,

660
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:32,110
the tricks are more than well set!

661
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,810
All we do is watch how everything turns out.

662
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,610
Hey, wait a minute!

663
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,110
Inspector!

664
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,810
There's something strange about Thief Kid this time.

665
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:44,010
What is it?

666
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:46,410
You see something that looks like a string?

667
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,410
Really?

668
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,510
Yes, a thing that looks like a thin string

669
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,310
is shining at his shoulders.

670
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:56,010
Hey, if that's true, then Thief Kid's not walking

671
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:58,310
but rather is being suspended from the helicopter?

672
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:00,510
Isn't there something strange about Thief Kid?

673
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:04,310
His legs are moving but it looks like he's being suspended to something.

674
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,710
Hey, chopper no.7 that is right above Thief Kid's head, respond!

675
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:10,810
Chopper no.7. Hey, chopper no.7?

676
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:21,310
He vanished. Thief Kid vanished right near the museum just now!

677
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,310
It's chopper no.7 after all!

678
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,410
His henchman that was on board chopper no.7

679
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:28,810
picked him up from within the curtain of smoke!

680
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:32,410
Hey, I hope all your choppers are numbered?

681
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:34,610
Yes, sir. Near the tail.

682
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:37,510
All the choppers patrolling the sky, do you hear me?

683
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,410
This is Inspector Nakamori from the Metropolitan Police Department!

684
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,410
Thief Kid is on board chopper no.7 with his accomplice!

685
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:44,510
Report the position of chopper no.7 immediately!

686
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,510
Surround it until the police choppers arrive

687
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,210
and don't let them get away!

688
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:52,610
This is chopper no.14. Chopper no.7 verified

689
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,710
to be waiting at the main entrance of the museum!

690
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,510
Okay! Keep an eye on it and continue the pursuit.

691
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,010
Roger.

692
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,410
This is chopper no.35,

693
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:03,210
chopper no.7 is currently right above Shiodome Park.

694
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:07,510
Hey, hold it! Shiodome Park is behind the museum, isn't it?

695
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,110
Chopper no.28 here,

696
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:11,910
chopper no.7 has gone a long distance off from Shiodome.

697
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,510
This is chopper no.9. I verify two chopper no.7s

698
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,910
in the foreground of Shiodome Park!

699
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,510
Hey, what the hell is going on?

700
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:21,210
Well, the number "7" is written on almost

701
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,110
all the tails of the helicopters around!

702
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:25,610
Thief Kid probably did this beforehand.

703
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:28,210
Idiot! That can't be.

704
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,710
If such a thing were to be done,

705
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,410
somebody would've noticed when boarding the craft!

706
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,510
Inspector!

707
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,810
What is it?

708
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,210
There are strange silhouetted figures

709
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,810
in front of the entrance of the museum,

710
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,910
not just one or two figures.

711
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,210
They're the subordinates

712
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,910
that I let into the building a while ago.

713
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:49,910
Don't tell me that Blue Wonder is in the case

714
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,510
that the officer in the middle is holding?

715
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,210
Just what do they think they're doing?

716
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:56,510
It's like they're letting him know that he is carrying it.

717
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,410
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

718
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,710
Get in right this minute!

719
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,710
Don't worry, sir.

720
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:06,010
This case is empty anyway, and we're just decoys.

721
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,610
Decoys?

722
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:10,310
Blue Wonder was taken out

723
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,910
from the back door of the museum in a trash bag

724
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,810
by Jirokichi Suzuki disguised as a sanitation man.

725
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:28,310
What's so funny?

726
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:31,110
Thief Kid.

727
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:33,010
What a crazy thing to say?

728
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:37,310
I laughed because I was able to protect that treasure from Thief Kid.

729
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:40,010
You idiot. I saw right through you

730
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:43,710
the minute you came to the museum today on this motorbike.

731
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:47,710
Just like now, you didn't have your goggles on earlier.

732
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,810
It would be pretty difficult

733
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:52,110
for one wearing contact lens to ride a motorbike without goggles.

734
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:55,110
The wind would hurt your eyes and you'd be in tears.

735
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,510
That is, even if you had a windshield,

736
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:59,310
it would be difficult to ride a motorbike.

737
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,110
Well, despite being super-rich,

738
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:04,010
the old man goes riding around on this flashy motorbike

739
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:06,110
without any bodyguards.

740
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,210
You'd have had more than enough opportunity to put him to sleep somewhere

741
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,510
and switch places with him.

742
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:13,710
By the way, you took the dog Lupin that was riding in this sidecar

743
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,510
to a shade in Shiodome Park.

744
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,510
I'm pretty sure it's still asleep though,

745
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:21,110
because of the sleeping drug you made it sniff.

746
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,110
How could I be Thief Kid?

747
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,810
I was right beside you

748
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:30,110
when Thief Kid appeared just a while ago, too.

749
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:34,810
The same goes for last night when he miraculously walked in midair.

750
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:37,410
That was no miracle.

751
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:41,410
It's a simple trick that can easily be carried out with an assistant.

752
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:43,710
Although the men are efficient members of the Suzuki Financial Group,

753
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,610
they're not from the police or the military.

754
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:47,410
It shouldn't be too hard to mix one of your men

755
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:52,210
among the bunch of professionals that were hired on a temporary basis.

756
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:56,710
You suddenly appeared last night in midair between the buildings

757
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:59,910
and brushed away our doubts about you having been suspended by something

758
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,710
by making a helicopter pass over your head.

759
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:06,010
After that, when the police and I ran up to the roof of the building,

760
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,710
all you had to do was make us confirm

761
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,910
that there were no wires connected between the buildings.

762
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:10,910
Since it would really make it look

763
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:13,010
as if you were floating in the air.

764
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:15,610
But if the pilot of the helicopter that flew over your head

765
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,910
were your assistant,

766
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,810
it's super easy to explain.

767
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,810
First of all, you fly on board the helicopter,

768
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:24,510
over to the two buildings you'll be using to carry out your trick,

769
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,210
and hook the tip of one side of the wire

770
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:29,110
onto the roof of one of the buildings.

771
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:32,810
Then, with the helicopter, you land on the roof of the other building,

772
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,110
hooking the wire onto the roof of that building.

773
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,110
You connect the wires from one building to the other,

774
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,110
then use the pulley that is attached to your body,

775
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,010
and move to the center.

776
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,910
Then you take off the black outfit you were wearing

777
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:45,210
together with the curtain of smoke, and dispose of it.

778
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:47,810
Then Thief Kid appears!

779
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,410
Your henchman comes immediately with the helicopter

780
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,110
and flies over your head.

781
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,810
The fish line-like thin wire that you connected yourself

782
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:57,310
to the helicopter with before getting off,

783
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,910
is pulled until it is taut and wound up!

784
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:02,710
After that you removed the pulley from your body

785
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,310
and made the helicopter swiftly collect the wire

786
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,610
that you hooked onto both buildings.

787
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,510
As a result, it would look as if you're floating in midair,

788
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:12,410
whether viewed from the top of the side.

789
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:14,810
Then, all that's left for you to do is to pretend

790
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,110
to walk together with the helicopter as it moves forward.

791
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:21,710
You used a tape recorder to create the sound of footsteps,

792
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:26,210
matching the sound from it with your stride.

793
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,710
In order to deceive people from thinking that you're being suspended,

794
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:31,710
you used exquisite body performance.

795
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,610
After walking a while, together with the curtain of smoke,

796
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,910
you abandoned your white clothes

797
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,410
and moved the position of the searchlight.

798
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,110
The helicopter pulls you up on board,

799
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:42,310
so it looks as if you vanished in midair.

800
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:45,210
Well, tonight's Thief Kid was merely a walking doll

801
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:47,710
that caught the attention of the police.

802
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,410
You were probably just pulling the doll in and out of the helicopter

803
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:50,710
together with the curtain of smoke.

804
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,910
All it was doing was hanging in the air,

805
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,810
so it was more than obvious that it was just a doll.

806
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:56,110
But, sonny you already climbed the building

807
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,910
that Thief Kid was on, didn't you?

808
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,710
If something was suspended from the helicopter,

809
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:02,810
no matter how thin the string, it would've been seen.

810
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:06,010
No, because of preconceived ideas and the wind.

811
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:08,410
Talk about wretched.

812
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,810
The moment the helicopter flew above your head,

813
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:14,010
I was convinced that you weren't being suspended.

814
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:17,210
I was flustered when I didn't find the wire on the roof,

815
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:19,810
and didn't notice that string.

816
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,810
But, the marks were surely left behind

817
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,510
on the roofs of the two buildings.

818
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,410
The marks left behind by the hooks that you hooked on beforehand,

819
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:28,810
when the wires were collected by the helicopter.

820
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:30,110
But sonny,

821
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:33,510
you saw the video of Thief Kid last night again and again, didn't you?

822
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,410
Although it also depends on the resolution,

823
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:36,910
if the string is as thin as a fishing line,

824
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,010
you would have to be very near and view it with the naked eye.

825
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:41,810
It'd be virtually impossible to view it on the monitor.

826
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:44,510
The only way the string would show is the down shot image

827
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,310
of Thief Kid when the string comes to the foreground,

828
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,010
and the only one who could've filmed this

829
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,210
is helicopter no.7 piloted by your henchman.

830
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,610
If you sent the image that was previously

831
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,710
used for airing a special program on the museum,

832
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,710
and you added the image of Thief Kid onto it

833
00:40:55,710 --> 00:41:00,110
and made it look as if helicopter no.7 sent it,

834
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,110
the string wouldn't be there.

835
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,010
That's why when it began to rain,

836
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:07,210
your henchman stopped sending the image, right?

837
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,810
Because on the aerial image back then,

838
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:12,310
there was no one using umbrellas!

839
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:14,410
The flashy demonstration you put on last night

840
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:16,110
was to make everyone think that you were coming from the sky,

841
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,910
and loosen the tight security on the ground.

842
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,410
You probably did so since you planned to disguise yourself

843
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,910
as Jirokichi Suzuki and come through with no check.

844
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,510
But, you goofed,

845
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:27,210
when you came with no goggles on

846
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,610
and that image was clearly on the TV screen.

847
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:32,710
No, it's not that I came with no goggles,

848
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,710
rather, I couldn't put them on.

849
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:38,010
Because my disguise would come off!

850
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:41,310
Aren't you worried about your comrade that's on board helicopter no.7?

851
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:45,110
I'm sure the police have surrounded his craft by now.

852
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:49,210
No need to worry, because the police are probably panicked.

853
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:51,510
They're probably flustered by all the no.7 stickers

854
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,910
on the helicopters.

855
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,810
All the stickers?

856
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:56,210
I see.

857
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:58,810
You stuck the stickers of the real numbers

858
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:02,010
of the helicopters over the no.7 stickers.

859
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:03,810
But the stickers of the real numbers were pasted on very lightly

860
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:05,710
so that the wind would easily blow them off.

861
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,710
Yes.

862
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:11,210
Therefore, the pilots of the helicopters go on board

863
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:13,910
totally unaware that they would be mistaken for being my henchman

864
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,310
and chased around.

865
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:18,410
In the meantime, my comrade splits amidst the commotion.

866
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:23,010
Indeed the great escape of the miracle of the vast sky, Blue Wonder!

867
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,210
The vast sky?

868
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:27,410
The blue of Blue Wonder is the blue of the ocean, you know.

869
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:28,910
It's the same thing.

870
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:32,510
The blue of the ocean is the reflection of the blue of the sky, right?

871
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,810
It's the same as the detective and the thief.

872
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:36,910
We seem as different as are heaven and earth.

873
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:37,910
However, if we trace back to the root of the matter,

874
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:40,510
we both force open the door to what people want to keep secret,

875
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,910
using the key of curiosity.

876
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:44,310
We're both nothing more than two rude men.

877
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:47,510
You idiot. The sky and the ocean are blue

878
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,210
due to totally different qualities of the dispersion

879
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:52,010
and reflection of light.

880
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:53,710
They're not to be thought of as the same!

881
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:56,710
As proof of that, the water in puddles is not blue, is it?

882
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:58,910
What a drab, wet blanket. You've got no dream.

883
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,710
I can't see through the truth chasing after dreams, you see.

884
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:06,710
Are you really thinking of nabbing me with that tranquilizer gun?

885
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:10,110
If I fall asleep at this speed, we're going to have an enormous crash.

886
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:13,410
Don't worry, I won't shoot until this motorbike stops.

887
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:15,110
And, as for your custody, I already contacted Inspector Nakamori,

888
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:17,410
who should be on his way here.

889
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:19,210
I'm not stopping.

890
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:22,610
Beside, remember what Gramps Jirokichi was bragging about?

891
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:28,110
This motorbike is rigged with an acceleration function.

892
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:32,010
See you, great detective.

893
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:34,210
I'll leave that treasure to you.

894
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:37,210
I wasn't after that treasure, to begin with.

895
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:40,510
Besides, all I did was take him on because he challenged me.

896
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:18,510
That punk.

897
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:54,910
You've got no dream.

898
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:57,110
Idiot. Of course, I do.

899
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:03,810
I've got dreams I want to realize too, you know.

900
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:11,510
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Uncle Jirokichi is angry at Conan now?

901
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,110
Right.

902
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:16,410
Why? Conan's the one who protected the treasure, right?

903
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:18,210
So, this is why.

904
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:22,410
That brat. How dare he take away the headlines from me.

905
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:28,720
Next Conan's Hint:

906
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,180
"A Meal For Two"
