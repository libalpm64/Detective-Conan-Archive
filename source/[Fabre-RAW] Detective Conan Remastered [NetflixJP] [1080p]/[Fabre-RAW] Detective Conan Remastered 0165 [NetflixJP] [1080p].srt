1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,760
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,560
Once he gets started, you can't stop him.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,360
Today it's an overnight stay at an inn for training.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,060
Ayumi and Genta disappear!

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,760
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,560
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,360
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,500
"The Disappearance of the Youth Detective Squad"

9
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,000
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Series of thievery at inns.

10
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,000
The guests and managers have suffered losses.

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
How dangerous.

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,800
But, well, it's larceny that doesn't use any brains.

13
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,600
I guess there's no reason for a great detective to make an appearance.

14
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,900
Gosh, dad.

15
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,900
But the way, I don't see that Conan around,

16
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,200
is he still in dreamland?

17
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,500
If it's Conan, he's gone to training camp!

18
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,000
The neighborhood's children's club.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,600
What's that?

20
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,900
The children's club will be putting on a puppet show.

21
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,100
A puppet show? A training camp?

22
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,300
Yes. At an inn on the Kiriga-oka Highlands.

23
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,200
He's staying over with the other children to practice.

24
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Which means...

25
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,300
that Youth Detective Squad is with him too.

26
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,700
-But I wonder if it's safe? -What is?

27
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,800
The thievery at inns that was in the newspapers!

28
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,000
There's nothing to worry about!

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,800
It's a totally different area.

30
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,600
But, Kirigaoka Highlands is famous

31
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,600
for the heavy fog that sets in at night.

32
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Well...

33
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
"Okkatakahara Sasayuki Village" -What if they get lost?

34
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,600
There's an adult with them, isn't there?

35
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,800
There is. A person who lives in Sanchome named Kaifu.

36
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,300
"Hajime Kaifu (28)" -It seems he did puppet plays when he was a student.

37
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,300
He's taking care of the script

38
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,900
and acting at the children's club this time.

39
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,000
Good grief, Dad.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,200
Let's see...

41
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,500
That's strange. Another person has disappeared.

42
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,800
Wait...

43
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,200
Genta! There are no feelings in that dialogue at all, is there?

44
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,600
Is that right?

45
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Yes, Genta one more time!

46
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,000
That's strange. Another person has disappeared!

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,300
And next, Ayumi's dialogue.

48
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,800
Let's see...

49
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,200
What's this all about?

50
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,500
He's acting big, that Mitsuhiko.

51
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,700
Next, it's your turn, Conan!

52
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,700
What? Let's see.

53
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,600
The murderer is definitely in here.

54
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,400
A high school student doing a puppet play.

55
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,200
I shouldn't have come like Haibara.

56
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,000
I have no interest in those things.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,200
Darn it! I envy that character!

58
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,900
Conan, that's no good!

59
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,600
You're supposed to be playing the role of a detective.

60
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,500
Put more force into the dialogue.

61
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,900
Isn't that right, Teacher Kaifu?

62
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,500
Mitsuhiko, let's not call me a teacher.

63
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,200
This is my first time producing too.

64
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,000
But Conan's role is...

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,800
You're definitely right.

66
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,700
Conan, can we try it again?

67
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,900
Yes.

68
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,800
The murderer is definitely in here!

69
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,500
The movement of the puppet isn't quite right.

70
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,600
Gosh. That Mitsuhiko... What's he all so gung-ho about?

71
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,400
That Mr. Kaifu moved into Mitsuhiko's neighborhood.

72
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,700
They quickly became friends.

73
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,300
He even let him help make this story.

74
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
But if I'm not mistaken, this is...

75
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,600
And, no one was left.

76
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,100
A kind of mystery.

77
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,100
Anybody can see that

78
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,600
it's been taken from Agetha Christie's famous novel.

79
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,700
I know the story!

80
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,800
People are invited to an island.

81
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,400
And they're killed off one by one.

82
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,500
Rather than that, I'm hungry.

83
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,400
Oh, Genta.

84
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,800
All right.

85
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,500
Then... let's call it quits for now!

86
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,700
One hour later, after dinner, let's try it again.

87
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,300
-Yes! -Yes!

88
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,900
Gather the puppets together

89
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,200
so they won't get lost.

90
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,700
-Yes! -Yes!

91
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,300
Great.

92
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,700
Dinner time...

93
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,500
Grilled eel with rice!

94
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,500
That Genta.

95
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,200
Conan, great job!

96
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
Well...

97
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,700
Pardon me.

98
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,000
Everybody still has a long way to go.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,600
Hard practice is necessary!

100
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,700
-What? -Hard practice...

101
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,400
Good grief.

102
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,100
What a thick fog.

103
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,000
I guess that's why it's called Kirigaoka Highlands.

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Just great... I'm full!

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,400
It's no good. I can't move an inch!

106
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,500
Everyone! Rest 30 minutes and it's practice again!

107
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Practice? Practice again?

108
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,400
Mitsuhiko! Give us a break!

109
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,900
But there's a midnight snack prepared too, Genta.

110
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,900
What! I'll do it...

111
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,900
Let's go! Hurry up!

112
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,700
Everybody.

113
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,900
Has someone seen the teacher around?

114
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,500
What's the matter?

115
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,400
Well... something's wrong.

116
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,800
He suddenly disappeared.

117
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,900
It's already time to practice.

118
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,600
Come to think of it. The Sanchome guys aren't around either.

119
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,700
You're right.

120
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,900
I wonder where they've gone.

121
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,600
This is a problem.

122
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,100
Hey, have you seen them?

123
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,600
Nope.

124
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,900
Just as I thought.

125
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,200
The dolls are missing too!

126
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,900
Those belonging to the Sanchome kids.

127
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,800
What? You're right.

128
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,300
The teacher is gone too!

129
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,800
Hey... This is just like...

130
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,900
Those Sanchome kids probably took it along with them.

131
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,300
But, where?

132
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,500
Well... maybe they went home?

133
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,000
At this hour?

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,100
In this fog?

135
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,300
Someone's outside.

136
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,100
It's no good!

137
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,000
I can't see anything with this fog.

138
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,500
No mistake about it!

139
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,000
Someone was here.

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,900
What? Even those kids are gone!

141
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,100
What?

142
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,400
Their dolls are gone too!

143
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,500
Only ours are left!

144
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,200
Darn it. This is a bad joke.

145
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,400
And, no one was left.

146
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,000
It's exactly the same.

147
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Is that the story this puppet play is based on?

148
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,400
Yes. In the original story,

149
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,300
the characters get killed off one by one.

150
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,800
And the dolls disappear as each person gets killed.

151
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,300
As they get killed off...

152
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,100
You got to be kidding!

153
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,200
Then...

154
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,700
All the children who have disappeared have been...

155
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,100
You're joking.

156
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,800
Calm down! We don't know for sure about that yet!

157
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,100
The backdoor!

158
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,300
The fog is heavy over here too.

159
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,100
It's the footprints of those children, isn't it?

160
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,700
There's one more pair. Those of an adult.

161
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,500
Whose are they?

162
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,300
Could it be from that guy who was at the window?

163
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,300
No.

164
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,400
The size and kind of shoe from those prints are different.

165
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,300
Then who?

166
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,000
The person at the managing office said that

167
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,900
this is the only inn with guests today.

168
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,400
Which means...

169
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,700
I don't know.

170
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,600
But, there's no doubt that there's something going on

171
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,900
in this foggy lodging area.

172
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,000
Something.

173
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,700
I know!

174
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,700
What? What do you know?

175
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,300
It's the doing of that thief who raids inn!

176
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,300
You mean the one that's in the news lately.

177
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,400
That's right.

178
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,900
There's no mistake about it.

179
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,700
He's probably locked everyone up somewhere.

180
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:00,400
In the meantime, he's planning to raid all the inns in the area!

181
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,500
So, that's it.

182
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,400
Okay! If that's the case,

183
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:09,300
the Youth Detective Squad is going to snag that thief!

184
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,900
Agree!

185
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,800
It's time for the Youth Detective Squad to move into action!

186
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,600
All right. Let's do it!

187
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,800
What's the matter, Conan?

188
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,400
Nothing.

189
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,100
But if it's a thief,

190
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,800
putting the kids aside,

191
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,200
why did he take the dolls?

192
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,800
This is full of things I can't understand!

193
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,100
Darn it!

194
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,000
Anyway...

195
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,300
It's best that we contact the police.

196
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,750
It won't be too late for the Youth Detective Squad

197
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,750
to make its appearance after that.

198
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,850
What?

199
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,350
Conan, what's the matter?

200
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,950
Can't you get hold of them?

201
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,950
The phone's dead.

202
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,050
With this,

203
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,650
we've been completely locked up in this fog.

204
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,650
Conan, what are you going to do?

205
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,550
There should be someone

206
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,150
at the management office over the hill.

207
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,550
Are you planning to go there?

208
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,050
Yes.

209
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,450
That's strange.

210
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,750
Weren't there a flashlight and candles around?

211
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,850
Yes. When we got here,

212
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,550
we checked out the emergency exits and saw them.

213
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,050
They are not there?

214
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,850
Yes. Somebody probably took them.

215
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,050
Somebody? Who?

216
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,450
Geez, Genta.

217
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,250
Who else would it be but the thief!

218
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,050
No. We can't be sure of that yet.

219
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,150
But at this rate, we'd get lost even more

220
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,050
if we tried to get to a nearby inn.

221
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:49,950
Anyway, let's try to find some leads in this inn.

222
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,150
Can't count on that too much.

223
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,350
Let's go, Conan!

224
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:03,150
Ayumi, stay here with Genta.

225
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,750
Can't be helped.

226
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,550
Genta! Take care of Ayumi.

227
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,750
Okay!

228
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,150
Be careful, Conan, Mitsuhiko.

229
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,650
Just leave it to us!

230
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,250
This is Mr. Kaifu's room.

231
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,750
Shall we try going in?

232
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,350
What's this?

233
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,450
It's a map of this area.

234
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:47,350
Inns here and there are marked.

235
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,150
What's this supposed to mean?

236
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,450
What's this?

237
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,950
Could it be...

238
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,950
You're kidding.

239
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,350
Teacher Kaifu is...

240
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,550
-Genta! -Ayumi!

241
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,150
Genta! Ayumi!

242
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,850
Where are you?

243
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,550
This is...

244
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,650
What's the matter, Conan...

245
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,750
You're kidding.

246
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:30,250
We're the only one left.

247
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,150
I got it...

248
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,250
The teacher...

249
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,150
That Teacher Kaifu is the thief that's raiding the inns.

250
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,350
The proof is that map and that tool box!

251
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,250
To raid the inns at Kirigaoka,

252
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,250
he used this puppet play practice as a coverup.

253
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,550
He even fooled us.

254
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,950
I can't forgive him.

255
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,950
Mitsuhiko, wait a minute!

256
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,350
Not only the children have disappeared,

257
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,250
but the dolls as well.

258
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,350
I don't think it's just a simple burglary.

259
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,650
Conan, you're over-thinking this one!

260
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,050
In the first place, Teacher Kaifu is the only one

261
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,350
who can take the dolls out!

262
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,950
That's true, but...

263
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,150
Anyway, all we can do is try to find Genta, Ayumi and the others.

264
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,650
That's right!

265
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,650
And, we're going to catch the criminal!

266
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,950
-What? -With our own hands.

267
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,140
The next inn was in this direction, wasn't it?

268
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,640
Yes.

269
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,540
That is...

270
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,140
I think this is too near to be the next inn.

271
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,140
Let's try going anyway!

272
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,740
Everyone!

273
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,940
Mr. Kaifu!

274
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,140
Oh, no!

275
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,140
It's him. It's him after all.

276
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,140
Where's everyone?

277
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,140
We're going in. Hurry!

278
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,140
No one's here.

279
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,940
It's no good.

280
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,840
I'll go check out the second floor!

281
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,840
-Conan. -Stay here!

282
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,340
Please make it quick.

283
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,340
Conan!

284
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,740
Mitsuhiko.

285
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,740
What?

286
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,840
Conan! What's the matter?

287
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,240
What are you trying to do?

288
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,240
Conan?

289
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,940
Run! Mitsuhiko, run!

290
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,040
Conan?

291
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,140
You're kidding.

292
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,840
Conan too.

293
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,240
Well...

294
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,440
And, you're the only one that was left right, Mitsuhiko?

295
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,940
You're joking...

296
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,440
Somebody!

297
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:02,140
Help me!

298
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,440
There's no use in running, Mitsuhiko!

299
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,940
All right. Come with me, Mitsuhiko!

300
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,040
Don't come...

301
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,640
Don't play the spoiled kid, Mitsuhiko.

302
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,840
Come.

303
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,140
-Hurry! -Oh, no...

304
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,740
Terrible...

305
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,640
Geez, thanks.

306
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,340
Conan?

307
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,740
Everyone?

308
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,040
Then this is...

309
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,040
Mitsuhiko, sorry about that.

310
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,740
We were practicing the puppet play.

311
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,940
I had each person come one by one to the inn.

312
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,740
You're kidding. I didn't hear anything about it.

313
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:32,240
Sorry about that. I forgot to tell you four about it.

314
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,440
Then, what were those pliers and screwdrivers for in your room?

315
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,740
I thought of making some simple stage installations.

316
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,840
I wanted all of you

317
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,540
to get the atmosphere of drama as quick as possible.

318
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,440
Then what about that map?

319
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,140
Of course. It's so we wouldn't get lost here.

320
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,740
I heard that the fog was really thick around here.

321
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,440
Is that what it was all about?

322
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,740
Those dolls that disappeared were,

323
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,140
of course, used for the practice.

324
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,640
Mitsuhiko. I bet it really scared you, didn't it?

325
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,740
Genta, you were just as scared.

326
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,340
What? Not really.

327
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,940
But, when we were doing voice training.

328
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,040
You thought we looked like we were tied up.

329
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,340
But we really thought you were.

330
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,740
Isn't that right, Conan?

331
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,640
Mitsuhiko, I'm sorry.

332
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,740
Even I scared you in the end.

333
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,540
Actually, at that time...

334
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,540
Run! Mitsuhiko, run!

335
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,740
Calm down, Conan.

336
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,940
All of you...

337
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,140
Is that what this is all about!

338
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,640
Mitsuhiko is the only one left.

339
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,840
Everyone, continue practicing.

340
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,040
Wait!

341
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,340
That guy was acting big all day today,

342
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,640
so, let's scare him a bit!

343
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,240
I think that's being too mean?

344
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,240
But it may be good drama practice.

345
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,040
Hey... What are these guys doing anyway?

346
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,340
You're kidding. Even you, Ayumi.

347
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,140
It's a shock!

348
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:11,040
Mr. Kaifu, why did you cut the telephone lines?

349
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,940
What are you talking about?

350
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,840
Teacher, wasn't it you?

351
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,440
What does it mean?

352
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,840
If it wasn't the teacher, who'd do a thing like that?

353
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,340
Could it be?

354
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,840
Mitsuhiko!

355
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,740
-Let's go! -Mitsuhiko!

356
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,740
-A real thief? -You saw me!

357
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,940
Help!

358
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,840
Mitsuhiko!

359
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,540
Help!

360
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,140
Mitsuhiko!

361
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,740
Conan. Everyone!

362
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,940
Then the one who cut the phone lines

363
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,140
and took the flashlights...

364
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,740
Right. It's his doing.

365
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,040
-The work of a real thief. -Help me!

366
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,340
Don't come!

367
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,440
Don't you care what happens to him?

368
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,040
Everyone! Never mind me.

369
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,940
Get this guy!

370
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,240
Mitsuhiko!

371
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,540
Don't make noise!

372
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,740
Be quiet...

373
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,540
You brat!

374
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,540
Let's get him!

375
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,940
-Yes! -Yes!

376
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,040
We did it!

377
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,740
That was a close call!

378
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,440
Dangerous...

379
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,840
I'm saved.

380
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,140
Conan, close your eyes a bit.

381
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,840
What?

382
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,740
Close your eyes tightly.

383
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,440
Mitsuhiko! I'm sorry about that comment a while ago.

384
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,740
You really impressed me.

385
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,540
Geez, I don't care if I die.

386
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,540
Mitsuhiko! I won't forgive you!

387
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,240
Please stop it, Genta!

388
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,940
How dare you!

389
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,640
Three day later, the town's Children's Club was held.

390
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,540
Our puppet play was performed.

391
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,940
The result is, of course...

392
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,640
A great success!

393
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,440
"Next Episode" -A trick ridge.

394
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,740
Spider mansion!

395
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,840
A thumbtack.

396
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,940
The surface is rusty but the needle is new.

397
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,440
But dad said not to leave the room.

398
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,340
Pops, wake up!

399
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,340
Ran is in danger!

400
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,640
Next Conan,

401
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,760
"Mystery Of The Spider Mansion Of Tottori (Part 1)"

402
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,000
Next Conan hint:

403
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,600
"The number of fishes"

404
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,800
Next episode is Heiji's turn.

405
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,300
-Heiji Tottori? -Heiji Hattori.
