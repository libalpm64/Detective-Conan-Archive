1
00:00:01,464 --> 00:00:03,564
Disguise!

2
00:00:03,564 --> 00:00:05,564
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:05,564 --> 00:00:06,964
The mystery of the mysterious locked room.

4
00:00:06,964 --> 00:00:08,464
The truth behind the fourth painting!

5
00:00:08,464 --> 00:00:10,564
What will become of the confrontation with Thief Kid?

6
00:00:10,564 --> 00:00:11,864
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,864 --> 00:00:13,464
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,464 --> 00:00:15,364
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:58,064 --> 00:02:00,464
"Blue Storm", the fourth of a set of paintings

10
00:02:00,464 --> 00:02:03,064
drawn by a famous painter named Mr. Takeyori Oikawa

11
00:02:03,064 --> 00:02:04,964
is sought after by Thief Kid.

12
00:02:06,064 --> 00:02:08,464
We are invited to the Oikawa residence,

13
00:02:08,464 --> 00:02:11,364
but the painting that is in the atelier

14
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:14,664
where the surveillance camera is set up disappeared just like that.

15
00:02:14,664 --> 00:02:17,864
And Mr. Oikawa's father-in-law,

16
00:02:17,864 --> 00:02:21,164
a famed landscape painter named Mr. Haruhito Kanbara,

17
00:02:21,164 --> 00:02:23,664
is found dead in that room.

18
00:02:24,864 --> 00:02:30,764
"Thief Kid and the Four Masterpieces (Part 2)"

19
00:02:34,264 --> 00:02:38,164
It's certain that Thief Kid is the one who killed Mr. Kanbara, right?

20
00:02:38,164 --> 00:02:40,264
We still can't come to any conclusion,

21
00:02:40,264 --> 00:02:42,664
but he's certainly a prime suspect.

22
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:45,264
Mr. Oikawa, are you going to paint it again?

23
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:48,064
The last of the flower, bird, wind, moon, the "Blue Storm".

24
00:02:49,764 --> 00:02:51,264
Well, of course...

25
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,764
I'm not going to paint another one.

26
00:02:52,764 --> 00:02:54,364
Forever.

27
00:02:54,364 --> 00:02:58,464
So I'd like to plead with Thief Kid.

28
00:02:58,464 --> 00:03:00,564
Give me back the "Blue Storm" that you stole tonight,

29
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:02,864
along with my father-in-law's life.

30
00:03:05,764 --> 00:03:07,164
Hey.

31
00:03:07,164 --> 00:03:09,264
When the Inspector Megure and the others arrived here,

32
00:03:09,264 --> 00:03:11,464
did you notice anything strange?

33
00:03:11,464 --> 00:03:13,464
Something strange?

34
00:03:13,464 --> 00:03:14,564
Come to think of it,

35
00:03:14,564 --> 00:03:18,764
one of the staff fell ill and was carried away from the crowd.

36
00:03:18,764 --> 00:03:21,064
I'm sure it was somebody from Nichiuri TV.

37
00:03:21,064 --> 00:03:22,264
I see.

38
00:03:22,264 --> 00:03:26,064
That's where he switched with one of the four.

39
00:03:26,064 --> 00:03:28,764
Then, did you see any suspicious looking bags?

40
00:03:28,764 --> 00:03:30,964
Something big enough to fit a person into.

41
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:33,164
No, I didn't.

42
00:03:33,164 --> 00:03:36,564
If you do find anything, will you secretly call my cell phone?

43
00:03:36,564 --> 00:03:39,364
Yeah, but why do you want me to contact you?

44
00:03:40,464 --> 00:03:43,264
Because Mr. Mouri said that Thief Kid may be disguised

45
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,064
as a member of the police.

46
00:03:45,064 --> 00:03:46,264
Are you serious?

47
00:03:46,264 --> 00:03:50,064
If my cell phone rings and I whisper it to Mr. Mouri,

48
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,664
Thief Kid won't suspect anything, will he?

49
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:52,764
I see.

50
00:03:54,364 --> 00:03:57,264
Mr. Kanbara's condition before he went into the atelier?

51
00:03:57,264 --> 00:03:59,264
Detective Mouri wants to know about it?

52
00:03:59,264 --> 00:04:02,264
Yes, he wants to know if Mr. Kanbara really went into the atelier

53
00:04:02,264 --> 00:04:04,564
to protect the painting himself.

54
00:04:04,564 --> 00:04:08,564
No. While Mr. Oikawa was checking the painting,

55
00:04:08,564 --> 00:04:10,364
Mr. Kanbara was standing in front of us all the while.

56
00:04:10,364 --> 00:04:14,164
He went in after Mr. Oikawa finished checking and opened the door.

57
00:04:14,164 --> 00:04:18,664
After that, they were both in the atelier for 1 to 2 minutes.

58
00:04:18,664 --> 00:04:21,064
He said that he was going to protect the painting at that time.

59
00:04:21,064 --> 00:04:24,564
Of course, we stopped Mr. Kanbara from going into the atelier,

60
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,764
but Mr. Oikawa said that it would only take a short while.

61
00:04:26,764 --> 00:04:31,564
We had no idea Mr. Kanbara was going to confine himself to the atelier.

62
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:33,564
However, after the blackout,

63
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,864
we really didn't expect the culprit to be hiding in the attic,

64
00:04:35,864 --> 00:04:38,464
ready to steal the painting and kill Mr. Kanbara.

65
00:04:38,464 --> 00:04:41,264
Did you notice anything different about Mr. Oikawa

66
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:42,964
who came out leaving Mr. Kanbara inside?

67
00:04:42,964 --> 00:04:45,964
For example, blood on his clothes or something?

68
00:04:45,964 --> 00:04:50,164
No, Mr. Oikawa didn't have blood anywhere on him.

69
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:54,064
But he could've committed the murder wearing his clothes inside out.

70
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:55,664
That's not possible either.

71
00:04:55,664 --> 00:04:59,564
Inspector Nakamori checked Mr. Oikawa's clothes right away, too.

72
00:04:59,564 --> 00:05:02,864
Blood was found on the outside of his jacket

73
00:05:02,864 --> 00:05:07,464
and there was no blood on the back of his jacket or below it.

74
00:05:07,464 --> 00:05:09,964
Besides, the blood that was found on his shirt got on him

75
00:05:09,964 --> 00:05:13,464
when he went inside in the dark along with the inspector and the others.

76
00:05:13,464 --> 00:05:16,764
He groped for Mr. Kanbara and coincidentally found him.

77
00:05:16,764 --> 00:05:18,964
He then carried Mr. Kanbara up.

78
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:23,764
But I wonder if it was really a coincidence?

79
00:05:23,764 --> 00:05:26,664
You came in with the inspector, didn't you?

80
00:05:26,664 --> 00:05:30,264
There's no way he would found Mr. Kanbara in the dark

81
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:32,964
without using light and stab him in the neck.

82
00:05:32,964 --> 00:05:36,064
He couldn't have done all that in such a short time.

83
00:05:40,564 --> 00:05:42,064
By the way,

84
00:05:42,064 --> 00:05:45,364
the door that Mr. Oikawa was pounding on during the blackout

85
00:05:45,364 --> 00:05:47,164
is the door on that side, right?

86
00:05:47,164 --> 00:05:51,264
Leaving Mr. Kanbara behind, he came out of this door

87
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:54,064
and yet why did he pound on the other door?

88
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:59,464
He was probably on his way to get the inspector

89
00:05:59,464 --> 00:06:03,164
to help get Mr. Kanbara out when the blackout occurred.

90
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:06,564
The inspector was in the room over that side.

91
00:06:06,564 --> 00:06:07,764
Come to think of it,

92
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:10,464
while Mr. Oikawa was checking his painting,

93
00:06:10,464 --> 00:06:13,064
the inspector was talking to him through the door over that side.

94
00:06:14,664 --> 00:06:16,764
Yeah, they were talking.

95
00:06:16,764 --> 00:06:19,564
He opened the door slightly and asked me to go check

96
00:06:19,564 --> 00:06:21,664
if the police really turned the surveillance camera off.

97
00:06:21,664 --> 00:06:26,064
He told me to knock once if it was still on.

98
00:06:26,064 --> 00:06:29,464
I knocked twice, the signal for it being off.

99
00:06:29,464 --> 00:06:33,964
Signal? I wonder why he didn't ask you to directly come tell him about it?

100
00:06:33,964 --> 00:06:37,664
Probably because he didn't want me to see the painting

101
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,264
that was still incomplete through the opening of the door.

102
00:06:40,464 --> 00:06:42,964
Did the forensic officers say anything?

103
00:06:42,964 --> 00:06:45,764
Yeah, they said that there were two things that bothered them.

104
00:06:45,764 --> 00:06:49,964
There was a strange trace of blood found on Mr. Kanbara's sweater,

105
00:06:49,964 --> 00:06:53,864
and an oval shaped mark was found at the base of his left thumb.

106
00:06:55,464 --> 00:06:56,764
As for the blood,

107
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:59,364
it probably got on because his left arm was bent in front of his chest

108
00:06:59,364 --> 00:07:01,264
when he was stabbed in the neck.

109
00:07:01,264 --> 00:07:04,964
But as for the oval shaped trace, they don't know what it is.

110
00:07:04,964 --> 00:07:07,364
Maybe that's...

111
00:07:07,364 --> 00:07:09,664
Conan, quit going here and there!

112
00:07:09,664 --> 00:07:10,864
We're going home.

113
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,264
But Thief Kid isn't caught yet!

114
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:16,164
That's a job for the police.

115
00:07:16,164 --> 00:07:17,864
It's already bed time for children, isn't it?

116
00:07:20,264 --> 00:07:21,964
That's enough.

117
00:07:23,364 --> 00:07:24,964
If the culprit is Thief Kid,

118
00:07:24,964 --> 00:07:27,064
he would've escaped using a hand glider,

119
00:07:27,064 --> 00:07:29,164
so there's no way we can cordon off the area.

120
00:07:29,164 --> 00:07:30,264
That's right.

121
00:07:30,264 --> 00:07:32,764
The most we can do is figure out his escape route.

122
00:07:32,764 --> 00:07:35,064
But don't you think it's funny?

123
00:07:35,064 --> 00:07:37,764
The Riot Task Force officers have this place surrounded

124
00:07:37,764 --> 00:07:40,564
and yet no one has seen anybody flee.

125
00:07:40,564 --> 00:07:43,964
That's because they didn't put any spotlight at the windows.

126
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,064
Yes, but...

127
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:47,864
But Thief Kid's hand glider is white.

128
00:07:47,864 --> 00:07:49,564
It couldn't have disappeared by a spell or something,

129
00:07:49,564 --> 00:07:51,464
so it's strange that no one saw it.

130
00:07:51,464 --> 00:07:53,864
He's right. Thief Kid is a magician.

131
00:07:53,864 --> 00:07:58,164
Unlike a witches' spell, magic has to be set up beforehand, right, Conan?

132
00:07:58,164 --> 00:08:01,664
-That's why... -Wait! Please don't get him involved, okay?

133
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:02,664
Okay.

134
00:08:02,664 --> 00:08:08,264
If he did disappear by magic, we don't know what trick he used.

135
00:08:08,264 --> 00:08:12,564
As to that, I've figured out something that might be a hint.

136
00:08:12,564 --> 00:08:14,464
May I try an experiment?

137
00:08:14,464 --> 00:08:18,164
It requires a newspaper and an empty glass cup.

138
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:23,064
I put the newspaper over this cup.

139
00:08:28,964 --> 00:08:31,764
Then I lift it up carefully.

140
00:08:31,764 --> 00:08:34,664
I put it on the middle of the desk.

141
00:08:34,664 --> 00:08:36,464
And...

142
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:39,764
The cup disappears and is gone.

143
00:08:41,364 --> 00:08:45,064
But that's just plain magic.

144
00:08:45,064 --> 00:08:48,364
You probably just dropped the cup on your lap after holding it,

145
00:08:48,364 --> 00:08:51,464
and just crushed the newspaper that was shaped like the cup.

146
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,864
I did this magic in my younger days

147
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:55,964
at a year-end party of the 1st section.

148
00:08:55,964 --> 00:08:57,764
Father told me about it.

149
00:08:57,764 --> 00:08:59,164
He said it was a wet blanket.

150
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,364
Oh, is that so?

151
00:09:01,364 --> 00:09:03,464
That's not the issue here!

152
00:09:03,464 --> 00:09:06,664
What does that magic have to do with what happened here?

153
00:09:06,664 --> 00:09:08,264
So you see,

154
00:09:08,264 --> 00:09:10,864
what I mean is, I think this is how Thief Kid disappeared.

155
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:14,264
I'm sorry!

156
00:09:14,264 --> 00:09:15,964
Don't worry about it.

157
00:09:15,964 --> 00:09:19,364
It's cheap stuff that I got as a wedding gift 40 years ago.

158
00:09:21,064 --> 00:09:22,164
I had no idea...

159
00:09:22,164 --> 00:09:23,564
Don't touch them so carelessly!

160
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:27,164
Cracked pieces like these may look like they're not there but actually are.

161
00:09:27,164 --> 00:09:28,364
Okay.

162
00:09:28,364 --> 00:09:30,464
Excuse me. Where is your wife?

163
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:32,764
She passed away five years ago.

164
00:09:32,764 --> 00:09:35,164
It was right after I had finished drawing the third painting

165
00:09:35,164 --> 00:09:38,564
of the flower, bird, wind and the moon, "Pure White".

166
00:09:38,564 --> 00:09:41,964
My wife was badly wounded by a tornado

167
00:09:41,964 --> 00:09:43,364
when she travelled abroad 15 years ago.

168
00:09:43,364 --> 00:09:46,664
She had been bedridden with a coma since.

169
00:09:46,664 --> 00:09:49,764
15 years ago, you also announced the first of the set

170
00:09:49,764 --> 00:09:53,164
of flower, bird, wind and moon, the "Red Lotus".

171
00:09:54,364 --> 00:09:57,764
Yes. It was a year after my wife's accident.

172
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:03,064
I painted that piece with all my might to make money for hospital bills.

173
00:10:03,064 --> 00:10:05,764
It was highly evaluated and I became a full-fledged painter.

174
00:10:05,764 --> 00:10:09,564
Until then, I was making a living teaching art class.

175
00:10:11,864 --> 00:10:12,864
Excuse me.

176
00:10:14,164 --> 00:10:16,464
I'm sorry, it's a call from my younger brother.

177
00:10:16,464 --> 00:10:18,264
Go ahead.

178
00:10:18,264 --> 00:10:19,964
Keep looking, there should be more.

179
00:10:19,964 --> 00:10:23,064
-I don't see any more... -Would you like to use some light?

180
00:10:23,064 --> 00:10:25,364
It'll be easier to find the pieces since they will glitter.

181
00:10:33,464 --> 00:10:34,764
What?

182
00:10:34,764 --> 00:10:35,964
Detective Mouri?

183
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:38,864
Yes. He was asking if there was anything else

184
00:10:38,864 --> 00:10:40,864
that came falling from the window of the atelier.

185
00:10:40,864 --> 00:10:44,064
All we found were two paint brush stands

186
00:10:44,064 --> 00:10:46,364
and a whole lot of paint brushes.

187
00:10:46,364 --> 00:10:48,364
Come to think of it,

188
00:10:48,364 --> 00:10:50,864
I did find this fishing line.

189
00:10:50,864 --> 00:10:53,464
There's a lake where you can fish near here,

190
00:10:53,464 --> 00:10:55,664
so I'm sure that someone who came fishing dropped it.

191
00:10:57,564 --> 00:11:00,064
It's approximately seven meters in length.

192
00:11:00,064 --> 00:11:02,764
There is a loop on one end

193
00:11:02,764 --> 00:11:06,264
and on the other end, there is a fish hook that's bent out of shape.

194
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:09,664
No doubt about it, the culprit used this.

195
00:11:09,664 --> 00:11:13,664
If so, I'm sure that it should be somewhere here.

196
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:18,764
There it is!

197
00:11:20,064 --> 00:11:22,364
It's this stone with a hole on it.

198
00:11:26,864 --> 00:11:28,564
It's you, sonny.

199
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:31,464
The big suspicious bag that you were talking about was found.

200
00:11:31,464 --> 00:11:32,564
Really?

201
00:11:32,564 --> 00:11:35,964
Yes. It was found near the broadcast van of Nichiuri TV.

202
00:11:35,964 --> 00:11:38,364
Officer Chiba is fast asleep inside.

203
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,164
Officer Chiba won't get up?

204
00:11:40,164 --> 00:11:43,164
No, we're trying to get him out of the bag right now,

205
00:11:43,164 --> 00:11:46,064
but the zipper is broken and won't come down below his neck.

206
00:11:46,064 --> 00:11:48,964
I got it! I'll relay the message to Mr. Mouri.

207
00:11:48,964 --> 00:11:51,464
Conan, Ran was looking for you.

208
00:11:51,464 --> 00:11:52,964
Officer Takagi.

209
00:11:52,964 --> 00:11:55,564
Officer Chiba who's at the villa is Thief Kid.

210
00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:56,564
What?

211
00:11:56,564 --> 00:11:59,164
They just found the real Officer Chiba.

212
00:11:59,164 --> 00:12:00,264
I have to tell everyone!

213
00:12:00,264 --> 00:12:01,564
Wait. Before that...

214
00:12:01,564 --> 00:12:02,664
Huh?

215
00:12:02,664 --> 00:12:05,864
Will you please look for the stolen painting

216
00:12:05,864 --> 00:12:08,364
that is still somewhere in this villa, Officer Takagi?

217
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:09,964
The "Blue Storm".

218
00:12:14,856 --> 00:12:17,456
"Blue Storm" is still here in this villa?

219
00:12:17,456 --> 00:12:19,956
But wasn't the painting stolen by Thief Kid?

220
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:22,456
It hasn't been stolen, that's why I want you to look for it.

221
00:12:22,456 --> 00:12:24,956
I know that you can find it, Officer Takagi.

222
00:12:25,856 --> 00:12:26,856
Yeah.

223
00:12:28,856 --> 00:12:30,656
Pops, this way. Over here!

224
00:12:30,656 --> 00:12:31,856
Gosh.

225
00:12:32,956 --> 00:12:34,956
Hey, we're going home.

226
00:12:34,956 --> 00:12:36,656
Thief Kid already escaped.

227
00:12:37,856 --> 00:12:38,856
Wait.

228
00:12:48,656 --> 00:12:52,156
Conan, let's leave the rest up to the police.

229
00:12:52,156 --> 00:12:54,256
No, there's no need to leave it up to them

230
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:56,556
-because I've already figured it out. -Huh?

231
00:12:56,556 --> 00:12:58,856
Ran, please call for Inspector Megure.

232
00:13:02,356 --> 00:13:03,956
Take a good look.

233
00:13:03,956 --> 00:13:05,956
This is the true identity of the "Blue Storm".

234
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:13,256
A fishing line.

235
00:13:13,256 --> 00:13:16,856
This is just a cloth covering the fishing line.

236
00:13:16,856 --> 00:13:20,456
It's the same magic as the one Officer Takagi performed.

237
00:13:20,456 --> 00:13:22,656
If you see a cup-shaped newspaper,

238
00:13:22,656 --> 00:13:25,456
you'd most naturally think that a cup is there.

239
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:28,856
Likewise, if you cover the easel with a cloth that is pulled taut,

240
00:13:28,856 --> 00:13:30,956
it's natural to think that a painting is underneath the cloth.

241
00:13:30,956 --> 00:13:34,356
This is a simple trick used to fool spectators.

242
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:38,156
First, a loop is made at one end of the fishing line.

243
00:13:38,156 --> 00:13:40,556
Then you pull the line over to the door.

244
00:13:40,556 --> 00:13:44,556
You lock the door after hooking the line onto the bolt of the door.

245
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:47,756
The fishing line is pulled right above the easel

246
00:13:47,756 --> 00:13:51,256
and set to pass between the brush stands and the paint brushes.

247
00:13:51,256 --> 00:13:53,456
The paint stands were used to make up for the difference in height,

248
00:13:53,456 --> 00:13:56,156
so that the line would become horizontal.

249
00:13:56,156 --> 00:14:00,656
And then, on the fish hook that is put on the other end of the line,

250
00:14:00,656 --> 00:14:06,056
a stone with a hole in it is hooked onto it and left to hang outside.

251
00:14:06,056 --> 00:14:09,456
After the fishing line is pulled taut, a cloth is placed over the easel

252
00:14:09,456 --> 00:14:12,156
and the "Blue Storm" before it is publicly announced is ready.

253
00:14:13,256 --> 00:14:17,156
All there's left to do is to break down the door during the blackout.

254
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,256
Go ahead and try it.

255
00:14:18,256 --> 00:14:19,256
Yes, sir.

256
00:14:20,256 --> 00:14:22,456
One, two, three!

257
00:14:22,456 --> 00:14:23,856
When the door opens,

258
00:14:23,856 --> 00:14:27,056
the line will be pulled by the weight of the stone that is hooked onto it.

259
00:14:27,056 --> 00:14:30,456
If the edge of the cloth hooks onto the place where the loop is tied,

260
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:32,956
the cloth will flip over making it cover one side of the easel.

261
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,556
The loop will then flip over

262
00:14:34,556 --> 00:14:37,956
and the brush stands that are stacked together will push the window open.

263
00:14:37,956 --> 00:14:39,356
The brush stands and paint brushes

264
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:41,456
would go falling out the window together with the fishing line and stone,

265
00:14:41,456 --> 00:14:46,356
and fall to the feet of the people on guard right below.

266
00:14:46,356 --> 00:14:49,856
If the brush stands and the paint brushes are toppled near the window

267
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,956
as soon as people come in after breaking the door down,

268
00:14:51,956 --> 00:14:54,856
it'll look as if someone had dropped the paint brushes and scattered them,

269
00:14:54,856 --> 00:14:57,256
then stole the painting and fled.

270
00:14:57,256 --> 00:15:00,056
But when and who could've rigged something like this up?

271
00:15:00,056 --> 00:15:02,156
It was all done when Mr. Oikawa went to check his painting

272
00:15:02,156 --> 00:15:04,556
and asked to have the surveillance camera turned off.

273
00:15:04,556 --> 00:15:05,556
What?

274
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:06,656
Then, don't tell me that...

275
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:07,756
That's right.

276
00:15:07,756 --> 00:15:11,156
The one who deceived everyone into thinking that the painting was stolen

277
00:15:11,156 --> 00:15:14,856
and the one who killed Mr. Kanbara

278
00:15:14,856 --> 00:15:18,756
is you, Mr. Oikawa.

279
00:15:18,756 --> 00:15:21,056
As proof of this,

280
00:15:21,056 --> 00:15:24,356
you opened the door slightly when you went in to check your painting

281
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,556
and talked to one of the Riot Task Force officers.

282
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:30,256
You went out of your way to ask him not to look inside the room,

283
00:15:30,256 --> 00:15:34,556
because you wouldn't have been able to hook the line around the bolt.

284
00:15:35,756 --> 00:15:38,356
Mr. Mouri, just what're you talking about?

285
00:15:38,356 --> 00:15:40,756
I said that because I didn't want anyone to see my painting

286
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:43,256
until it is completed.

287
00:15:43,256 --> 00:15:47,256
Besides, my father-in-law came into the atelier on his own.

288
00:15:47,256 --> 00:15:49,356
Why would I kill my father-in-law

289
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:50,656
who said he'd guard the painting himself?

290
00:15:50,656 --> 00:15:54,456
No, you just made that story up.

291
00:15:54,456 --> 00:15:58,556
You kept avoiding Mr. Kanbara who insisted to talk to you.

292
00:15:58,556 --> 00:16:01,156
You worked it out so that he would come to the atelier on his own

293
00:16:01,156 --> 00:16:04,356
by saying that you two could talk there.

294
00:16:04,356 --> 00:16:07,056
When Mr. Kanbara came to the atelier,

295
00:16:07,056 --> 00:16:09,756
you passed him out with a stun gun.

296
00:16:11,456 --> 00:16:14,356
You waited for the timer to go off causing the blackout.

297
00:16:14,356 --> 00:16:17,056
You were waiting for the time for the lights to go out

298
00:16:17,056 --> 00:16:19,556
just as you went to call Inspector Nakamori.

299
00:16:19,556 --> 00:16:23,256
You entered the room from behind Inspector Nakamori

300
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:25,956
and ran swiftly up to Mr. Kanbara who was passed out.

301
00:16:25,956 --> 00:16:28,156
Then you stabbed him in the neck with a knife.

302
00:16:28,156 --> 00:16:29,856
This is what actually happened.

303
00:16:33,356 --> 00:16:34,956
Too bad, that's impossible.

304
00:16:34,956 --> 00:16:38,956
I can't see in the dark and I had no light with me.

305
00:16:40,456 --> 00:16:42,556
Yes, you can.

306
00:16:42,556 --> 00:16:44,456
Even without light.

307
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,156
So long as you have a cell phone with you.

308
00:16:59,756 --> 00:17:03,556
You put the phone on top of Mr. Kanbara and ring the phone in the dark.

309
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:08,456
It would flash so you can verify where he is immediately.

310
00:17:08,456 --> 00:17:10,356
If you had the sound turned off,

311
00:17:10,356 --> 00:17:12,656
Inspector Nakamori and the others who broke the door down

312
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:16,456
would be distracted by the paint brush stands above everything.

313
00:17:16,456 --> 00:17:17,956
Mr. Oikawa.

314
00:17:17,956 --> 00:17:21,656
If I remember correctly, you had two cell phones, didn't you?

315
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:25,256
The white one for private use and the black one for work.

316
00:17:25,256 --> 00:17:26,556
The white one is apparently for private use

317
00:17:26,556 --> 00:17:32,056
because you said the blood got on when you tried to call a family member.

318
00:17:32,056 --> 00:17:33,456
Despite this,

319
00:17:33,456 --> 00:17:38,356
you answered the black phone when you got a call from your younger brother.

320
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:42,956
Is the white cell phone with blood on it really yours?

321
00:17:42,956 --> 00:17:45,556
I'm sure that you've already deleted all the data in it,

322
00:17:45,556 --> 00:17:48,156
but the police can still check on it, you know.

323
00:17:48,156 --> 00:17:50,256
They can find out who the cell phone belonged to

324
00:17:50,256 --> 00:17:53,556
and who picked the call up during the blackout.

325
00:17:55,756 --> 00:17:58,856
Just as you deduced, that's my father-in-law's cell phone.

326
00:17:58,856 --> 00:18:03,456
I used it to verify the location of that old ogre in the dark.

327
00:18:03,456 --> 00:18:05,556
-Ogre? -He's indeed an ogre.

328
00:18:05,556 --> 00:18:09,156
He tried to force me to draw a painting that relates to the wind

329
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:11,556
that had caused the death of my wife.

330
00:18:11,556 --> 00:18:14,056
You did mention that your wife died because of a tornado.

331
00:18:14,056 --> 00:18:16,856
Why did you decide to draw a four-part painting

332
00:18:16,856 --> 00:18:18,556
of flower, bird, wind and the moon then?

333
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,756
Did you know?

334
00:18:19,756 --> 00:18:21,656
There are other words such as snow, moon and flower

335
00:18:21,656 --> 00:18:24,556
that describe the beauty of nature?

336
00:18:24,556 --> 00:18:27,556
Right, the first painting was a red lotus lower,

337
00:18:27,556 --> 00:18:29,956
the second was the golden moon,

338
00:18:29,956 --> 00:18:33,556
and the third was of a Japanese crane standing on snowy ground.

339
00:18:33,556 --> 00:18:36,156
I didn't mean to paint the pure white crane, but rather, I drew the snow.

340
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:40,156
Actually, the painting was finished then.

341
00:18:40,156 --> 00:18:41,656
But father-in-law...

342
00:18:41,656 --> 00:18:44,556
He told the rich man who bought "Red Lotus" and "Golden Moon"

343
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,756
that if he bought "Pure White" for a higher price,

344
00:18:46,756 --> 00:18:48,656
he would sell him the next piece, "Blue Storm", too.

345
00:18:48,656 --> 00:18:52,556
He lied saying that it was a set of four, the flower, bird, wind and moon.

346
00:18:52,556 --> 00:18:55,656
Even though it was to make money for my wife's hospital bills,

347
00:18:55,656 --> 00:18:58,456
it was just too much for me.

348
00:18:58,456 --> 00:18:59,956
Do you think that I could paint "Blue Storm"

349
00:18:59,956 --> 00:19:04,156
after my wife died and I have lost my purpose?

350
00:19:04,156 --> 00:19:07,856
After a lot of thinking, I finally thought up this trick.

351
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:10,456
But he said he would go through with his own plan if I did the trick.

352
00:19:10,456 --> 00:19:13,856
-Plan? -He was going to disclose everything!

353
00:19:13,856 --> 00:19:15,856
That the "Blue Storm" never existed

354
00:19:15,856 --> 00:19:19,456
and that the warning from Thief Kid was also something I made up!

355
00:19:19,456 --> 00:19:20,656
Not even considering the fact that if he did so,

356
00:19:20,656 --> 00:19:22,856
my name as a painter would be soiled

357
00:19:22,856 --> 00:19:25,756
and I would lose my entire career!

358
00:19:25,756 --> 00:19:27,756
You're wrong.

359
00:19:27,756 --> 00:19:30,456
I think when Mr. Kanbara said he had something in mind,

360
00:19:30,456 --> 00:19:32,256
he meant this.

361
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:33,256
Officer Takagi.

362
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:34,756
That thing you're holding is...

363
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,356
Don't tell me that's...

364
00:19:36,356 --> 00:19:39,456
"Blue Storm", the first wind of summer that blows across the green leaves.

365
00:19:39,456 --> 00:19:41,956
Unlike the other three paintings,

366
00:19:41,956 --> 00:19:44,056
this was drawn by the master of landscape painter,

367
00:19:44,056 --> 00:19:46,256
Haruhito Kanbara.

368
00:19:46,256 --> 00:19:47,356
No way!

369
00:19:47,356 --> 00:19:49,456
His hand was hurt, so he couldn't have drawn it.

370
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:51,756
You didn't know, did you?

371
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:56,956
The trace of the palette that was found on Mr. Kanbara's left thumb.

372
00:19:56,956 --> 00:20:00,156
A paint brush with teeth marks on it was also found

373
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:02,556
in the storeroom of Mr. Kanbara's room where the painting was stored.

374
00:20:02,556 --> 00:20:05,056
I think that Mr. Kanbara was painting the picture

375
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:06,756
by holding the paint brush in his mouth.

376
00:20:06,756 --> 00:20:09,656
He did so in order to match your way of painting.

377
00:20:09,656 --> 00:20:11,156
Why didn't he tell me then?

378
00:20:11,156 --> 00:20:12,756
He couldn't.

379
00:20:12,756 --> 00:20:15,056
Even if he were able to draw it,

380
00:20:15,056 --> 00:20:18,156
it was still only a copy of your style.

381
00:20:18,156 --> 00:20:22,656
If anybody found out, it would indeed unmistakably soil your name.

382
00:20:26,256 --> 00:20:28,656
No.

383
00:20:28,656 --> 00:20:29,956
I...

384
00:20:29,956 --> 00:20:31,356
Mr. Oikawa.

385
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:34,756
It's slightly roughly drawn since he used his mouth,

386
00:20:34,756 --> 00:20:38,256
but as for me, I like that "Blue Storm", too.

387
00:20:38,256 --> 00:20:40,956
Just like the other three paintings you drew,

388
00:20:40,956 --> 00:20:44,156
the feeling of wanting to help somebody really shows.

389
00:22:16,156 --> 00:22:17,956
Officer Takagi?

390
00:22:17,956 --> 00:22:19,256
Yeah.

391
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:22,256
Are you thinking of spreading your wings and flying out of there?

392
00:22:22,256 --> 00:22:24,856
Or am I just imagining things?

393
00:22:24,856 --> 00:22:26,356
How did you find out?

394
00:22:26,356 --> 00:22:28,256
By elimination.

395
00:22:28,256 --> 00:22:31,756
You couldn't have known about the magic performance

396
00:22:31,756 --> 00:22:33,856
that Inspector Megure put on at the year-end party.

397
00:22:33,856 --> 00:22:36,156
Inspector Megure was there,

398
00:22:36,156 --> 00:22:39,556
and Officer Sato learned about it from her father.

399
00:22:39,556 --> 00:22:44,056
Officer Chiba who was found in the bag is also not Thief Kid.

400
00:22:44,056 --> 00:22:47,056
It's unthinkable that you would leave the bag in such a conspicuous place.

401
00:22:47,056 --> 00:22:51,656
The zipper didn't open from neck down in order to hide the physique.

402
00:22:51,656 --> 00:22:55,956
In other words, they can see a sleeping Officer Chiba,

403
00:22:55,956 --> 00:22:57,756
but it was actually Officer Takagi.

404
00:22:57,756 --> 00:23:01,456
It was a trick to escape during the commotion when things came to light.

405
00:23:01,456 --> 00:23:03,056
But I appreciate what you did.

406
00:23:03,056 --> 00:23:04,456
Thanks to your magic,

407
00:23:04,456 --> 00:23:06,756
I was able to figure out the trick of this case.

408
00:23:06,756 --> 00:23:11,156
Well, magic is my specialty after all.

409
00:23:13,156 --> 00:23:15,156
But...

410
00:23:15,156 --> 00:23:17,256
do me a favour and let me go this time.

411
00:23:17,256 --> 00:23:19,556
I just came to clear my name.

412
00:23:19,556 --> 00:23:21,456
After all, I'm completely white this time.

413
00:23:21,456 --> 00:23:22,956
Just like the girl's underwear.

414
00:23:22,956 --> 00:23:24,156
Conan?

415
00:23:27,356 --> 00:23:28,856
Hey, it's about time we...

416
00:23:28,856 --> 00:23:29,856
No...

417
00:23:32,656 --> 00:23:33,656
Take this!

418
00:23:36,956 --> 00:23:37,956
Why you...

419
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,256
Thief Kid!

420
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:44,556
Thief Kid was disguised as Officer Takagi.

421
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:45,956
Strange.

422
00:23:45,956 --> 00:23:47,756
The ball that I kicked in the smoke,

423
00:23:47,756 --> 00:23:48,956
it should've hit him.

424
00:23:48,956 --> 00:23:50,556
What's this? What's this?

425
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:52,856
Dad, your pants are...

426
00:23:54,156 --> 00:23:57,556
That hurts.

427
00:23:57,556 --> 00:23:59,256
That brat...

428
00:24:46,856 --> 00:24:48,556
Next Conan's Hint:

429
00:24:48,556 --> 00:24:50,956
"Expressway information"

430
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:52,756
-In the next episode... -Dad's got to keep going!

431
00:24:52,756 --> 00:24:54,156
Where's he going? To a hot spring or something?

432
00:24:54,156 --> 00:24:55,856
-Wrong. -It's so obvious.
