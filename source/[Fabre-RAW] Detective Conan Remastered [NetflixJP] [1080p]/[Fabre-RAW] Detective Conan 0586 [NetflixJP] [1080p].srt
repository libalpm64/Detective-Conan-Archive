1
00:00:02,912 --> 00:00:04,912
Giraffe's horn.

2
00:00:04,912 --> 00:00:07,012
It is the amber horn of a giraffe statue that advisor

3
00:00:07,012 --> 00:00:10,512
Jirokichi Suzuki found in the main building

4
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:13,312
of a mountain temple.

5
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:15,995
That Thief Kid who puts on airs is after this treasure

6
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:17,412
and sends Jirokichi a forewarning

7
00:00:17,412 --> 00:00:18,612
letter of his intent to steal this.

8
00:00:20,412 --> 00:00:21,712
The advisor takes us,

9
00:00:21,712 --> 00:00:23,512
the members of the Youth Detective Squad,

10
00:00:23,512 --> 00:00:26,012
whom he figures Thief Kid cannot disguise himself as,

11
00:00:26,012 --> 00:00:28,612
along with the TV crew,

12
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,912
and is all out to capture Thief Kid.

13
00:00:32,212 --> 00:00:35,412
In order to get it you have to insert keys

14
00:00:35,412 --> 00:00:36,912
into each pedestal that is in

15
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:41,712
all four corners of the room

16
00:00:41,712 --> 00:00:43,812
and turn the keys all at that same time.

17
00:00:49,212 --> 00:00:52,812
Okay. Come whenever you like, Thief Kid.

18
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:57,312
I'm going to get you for sure this time.

19
00:01:16,912 --> 00:01:18,712
Brooding over passing seasons,

20
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,612
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

21
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:22,412
The treasure that vanished and Thief Kid.

22
00:01:22,412 --> 00:01:24,712
Youth Detective Squad, catch him without Conan's help.

23
00:01:24,712 --> 00:01:26,065
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:26,312 --> 00:01:28,067
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:30,412
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

26
00:02:54,917 --> 00:03:00,159
"Giraffe Horn that Vanished in the Dark"

27
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:07,617
-Okay, close it. -Yes, sir!

28
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:18,177
Like so... If you don't turn all four keys

29
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:20,179
of the four pedestal at the same time,

30
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:23,017
you cannot view the statue of the giraffe.

31
00:03:23,017 --> 00:03:25,217
-What? -In other words, unless he

32
00:03:25,217 --> 00:03:27,117
steals these keys from me

33
00:03:27,117 --> 00:03:29,917
and split himself into four,

34
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:32,191
he can't take it away from me.

35
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:35,517
Don't tell me that the person who made this is...

36
00:03:35,517 --> 00:03:38,197
Of course, the master of tricks during the days of the Tokugawa Shogunate.

37
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:41,417
Kichiemon Samizu, right?

38
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:42,717
Yes.

39
00:03:42,717 --> 00:03:45,317
It's written at the foot of the pillar.

40
00:03:45,317 --> 00:03:47,317
"One who desires to acquire the giraffe

41
00:03:47,317 --> 00:03:49,517
without using the correct method,

42
00:03:49,517 --> 00:03:51,517
must move with the flow."

43
00:03:51,517 --> 00:03:53,917
Kichiemon Samizu.

44
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:55,617
Did you figure out what this means?

45
00:03:55,617 --> 00:03:57,717
No. Not yet.

46
00:03:57,717 --> 00:04:00,219
So long as I have these four keys,

47
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:01,617
everything will be all right.

48
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,217
He can't steal them from me.

49
00:04:04,817 --> 00:04:07,317
What an easy-going old man.

50
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:10,229
If three of his accomplices are among the people here,

51
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:11,417
and black this place out,

52
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:15,417
all they'd have left to do is to steal the keys.

53
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:16,717
That's true.

54
00:04:16,717 --> 00:04:19,117
Thief Kid could black this make-shift lighting

55
00:04:19,117 --> 00:04:22,717
out in no time at all.

56
00:04:22,717 --> 00:04:24,243
Yes.

57
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:26,245
Even the electric shock current going through the pedestals

58
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:28,617
would be easily cut off

59
00:04:28,617 --> 00:04:30,617
if we have only four people to guard

60
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:35,017
the keyholes of the pedestal in the dark...

61
00:04:35,017 --> 00:04:37,117
But, I can't say for sure either when any of my men

62
00:04:37,117 --> 00:04:39,317
would be switched with Thief Kid.

63
00:04:39,317 --> 00:04:42,717
I can't trust the three TV crew either.

64
00:04:42,717 --> 00:04:45,617
Darn! If there was only one keyhole,

65
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:48,267
I would guard over my dead body.

66
00:04:48,517 --> 00:04:51,017
We'll guard it for you then.

67
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:54,017
Thief Kid can't disguise himself as us.

68
00:04:54,017 --> 00:04:57,017
We can be most trusted.

69
00:04:58,617 --> 00:05:03,017
And if we protect the treasure on our own,

70
00:05:03,017 --> 00:05:05,717
we can show Conan that we're pretty good ourselves.

71
00:05:05,717 --> 00:05:07,217
Right.

72
00:05:07,217 --> 00:05:09,217
But, can you really handle it?

73
00:05:09,217 --> 00:05:11,717
If you touch the pedestal before the electricity

74
00:05:11,717 --> 00:05:13,617
is cut off, you'll get shocked.

75
00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:14,717
We'll be fine.

76
00:05:14,717 --> 00:05:17,117
So long as we don't mess up the order.

77
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:18,317
Each time it beeps,

78
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:20,017
it's suppose to cut off in the order of green, red,

79
00:05:20,017 --> 00:05:22,301
white and black, right?

80
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:25,717
That's right, don't mess up.

81
00:05:25,717 --> 00:05:27,517
So, it's only 10 more minutes to go

82
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:28,917
before the time Thief Kid promised he'll be appearing.

83
00:05:28,917 --> 00:05:30,817
Will Thief Kid really show up in this mountain temple

84
00:05:30,817 --> 00:05:34,313
where the members of the Youth Detective Squad await him?

85
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:37,117
Okay, we're all going to work together and capture Thief Kid!

86
00:05:37,117 --> 00:05:38,917
Okay!

87
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:41,617
Conan and the others are really on TV.

88
00:05:41,617 --> 00:05:43,317
How lucky.

89
00:05:43,317 --> 00:05:45,417
You guys should've gone too.

90
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:49,017
Uncle Jirokichi told us not to come. He said,

91
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:51,317
"Only the children get to come over this time.

92
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:55,317
Since Thief Kid can disguise into both of you, don't come!" right?

93
00:05:57,017 --> 00:05:59,817
Take Five.

94
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,341
We'll have to stand by from 3 minutes before,

95
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:03,217
so be ready, okay?

96
00:06:03,217 --> 00:06:05,517
-Okay! -Got you.

97
00:06:05,517 --> 00:06:07,917
We'll stand by too.

98
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:09,317
Right!

99
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:11,517
Hey! Where are you guys going?

100
00:06:11,517 --> 00:06:13,517
We're going to guard the pedestal.

101
00:06:13,517 --> 00:06:14,817
The problem is whether

102
00:06:14,817 --> 00:06:17,717
or not you can guard the keys though.

103
00:06:17,717 --> 00:06:20,117
No need to worry about that.

104
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:26,017
Since they're nailed onto the wall like this,

105
00:06:26,017 --> 00:06:28,367
he couldn't possibly lay a hand on them,

106
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,017
so I win.

107
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:34,373
Black-out?

108
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:35,817
No need to fret.

109
00:06:35,817 --> 00:06:37,817
A black out was expected to begin with.

110
00:06:39,017 --> 00:06:41,517
Wind and rain, did someone open the window?

111
00:06:43,217 --> 00:06:44,383
Is the camera rolling?

112
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:47,217
Yes, but it's so dark, practically nothing is in view.

113
00:06:47,217 --> 00:06:49,917
-How's the sound? -I'm picking it up somehow.

114
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:04,717
It can't be.

115
00:07:04,717 --> 00:07:06,405
What's this sound?

116
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:07,317
The pillar?

117
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:15,317
Conan.

118
00:07:17,617 --> 00:07:19,717
Conan!

119
00:07:19,717 --> 00:07:21,217
Get a hold of yourself!

120
00:07:21,217 --> 00:07:22,817
Conan?

121
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:29,017
The giraffe's...

122
00:07:29,017 --> 00:07:32,717
The giraffe's horn is gone.

123
00:07:32,717 --> 00:07:34,917
Conan!

124
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:37,017
Conan.

125
00:07:37,017 --> 00:07:38,437
Please open your eyes.

126
00:07:38,617 --> 00:07:40,439
Conan.

127
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,717
What's taking you so long?

128
00:07:41,717 --> 00:07:43,917
Can't you get the lights back on yet?

129
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:47,317
Cool it! Everybody stay where you are!

130
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:49,817
Hey, what is going on?

131
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:51,317
Is Thief Kid here or what?

132
00:07:51,317 --> 00:07:52,451
I wonder...

133
00:07:54,717 --> 00:07:55,717
There.

134
00:07:57,217 --> 00:07:58,457
Hey, hey, hey.

135
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:00,817
The giraffe's horn's been taken.

136
00:08:00,817 --> 00:08:01,817
It can't be.

137
00:08:01,817 --> 00:08:05,617
The four keys are still fixed to the wall.

138
00:08:05,617 --> 00:08:07,417
How in the world...

139
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:10,217
I don't know how he did it yet but...

140
00:08:10,217 --> 00:08:12,471
Either he or his accomplice ran around in the dark

141
00:08:12,717 --> 00:08:16,475
during the one minute that the lights were out

142
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:19,517
and reached the four pedestals with the keyholes,

143
00:08:19,517 --> 00:08:20,479
that's for sure.

144
00:08:23,217 --> 00:08:24,817
This is...

145
00:08:24,817 --> 00:08:26,485
Thief Kid's card!

146
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:28,487
Darn! Just when did he...

147
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:29,717
Inspector!

148
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,491
There's a card on the pedestal over here too.

149
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:33,917
Over here too.

150
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:35,017
This side too.

151
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:38,917
All four of them?

152
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:41,017
Inspector, the breaker of the main building

153
00:08:41,017 --> 00:08:43,017
has been rigged in a strange way

154
00:08:43,017 --> 00:08:45,117
and it's thought that the black-out was caused by it.

155
00:08:45,117 --> 00:08:48,217
Inspector. Please come this way.

156
00:08:48,217 --> 00:08:51,217
It seems that a tiny timer-type bomb

157
00:08:51,217 --> 00:08:54,513
was set on to all the shutters of this building.

158
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:56,817
Darn, that Thief Kid.

159
00:08:56,817 --> 00:08:59,517
He not only blacked the place out and threw us into the dark

160
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:00,817
but also blew away the windows,

161
00:09:00,817 --> 00:09:03,717
let in the wind and rain in order to confuse us

162
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:06,917
and fled during all the chaos.

163
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:09,517
At any rate, I'm taking this brat

164
00:09:09,517 --> 00:09:11,217
who was attacked by Thief Kid to the hospital.

165
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,217
Get me a car.

166
00:09:13,217 --> 00:09:15,717
All the other remaining cars go after Thief Kid!

167
00:09:15,717 --> 00:09:18,537
He couldn't possibly use his hand glider in this typhoon,

168
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:21,117
so shouldn't have gone too far yet.

169
00:09:21,117 --> 00:09:22,917
But...

170
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:25,517
According to the information we received a while ago...

171
00:09:25,517 --> 00:09:29,617
What? The road is blocked because of a landslide?

172
00:09:29,617 --> 00:09:33,317
Hey, hey, if that brat was given poison or something...

173
00:09:33,317 --> 00:09:36,555
It's not poison.

174
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:39,017
Look! It's a stun gun.

175
00:09:39,017 --> 00:09:42,017
It seems he was knocked out by this.

176
00:09:42,017 --> 00:09:43,717
I see.

177
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:46,565
That guy decided to put this little one,

178
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:49,217
who's most hard to beat to sleep first.

179
00:09:49,217 --> 00:09:50,217
Sorry.

180
00:09:50,217 --> 00:09:52,571
What do you mean, "I see".

181
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:56,217
I mean, it's all because you went and publicized

182
00:09:56,217 --> 00:09:59,317
that jewelry that you just found last week to the media

183
00:09:59,317 --> 00:10:01,317
even before we completed preparing or tight security.

184
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:03,017
That's why he walked off with the treasure.

185
00:10:03,017 --> 00:10:05,217
It was a month ago.

186
00:10:05,217 --> 00:10:07,917
I heard a month ago that the perfect amber,

187
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:09,817
the giraffe's horns

188
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,317
was laying asleep here at this temple.

189
00:10:12,317 --> 00:10:14,317
I had them change the date of publicizing

190
00:10:14,317 --> 00:10:17,417
because I was in the process of purchasing the treasure.

191
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,317
I wanted him to think that this old man

192
00:10:19,317 --> 00:10:21,717
here got carried away at finding the perfect bait

193
00:10:21,717 --> 00:10:24,603
to capture that thief...

194
00:10:24,817 --> 00:10:27,017
Therefore, although security wasn't really prepared yet,

195
00:10:27,017 --> 00:10:29,817
I lead him to think that I accepted his challenge.

196
00:10:29,817 --> 00:10:33,517
Which means that the make-shift lighting...

197
00:10:33,517 --> 00:10:37,917
Right, I knew he would be causing a black-out.

198
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:42,417
I also knew about that trick he used on the shutters.

199
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:45,517
The electric current I rigged on the pedestals

200
00:10:45,517 --> 00:10:51,617
and calling the children were all strategies to lure him

201
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,217
to coming to this temple.

202
00:10:54,217 --> 00:10:56,317
The lattice on the windows that with wood

203
00:10:56,317 --> 00:10:58,117
that looks worn out and easy to break.

204
00:10:58,117 --> 00:10:59,517
As well as the wall here that looks as if it would collapse

205
00:10:59,517 --> 00:11:00,639
with the pound of a fist

206
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,417
are all made of steel on the inside.

207
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:05,617
Moreover, on one of the doors of the two at the entrance,

208
00:11:05,617 --> 00:11:07,317
it is made so that it can be locked

209
00:11:07,317 --> 00:11:09,817
and a sensor is built into it.

210
00:11:09,817 --> 00:11:11,617
If the door is forced open,

211
00:11:11,617 --> 00:11:15,217
a very noisy alarm is set to go off.

212
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,417
But since there were no such sound,

213
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:22,117
in other words, Thief Kid and his accomplices...

214
00:11:22,117 --> 00:11:25,717
are still in here.

215
00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:27,717
They are...

216
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:29,417
The Thief Kid is still in here?

217
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:30,669
Thief Kid?

218
00:11:39,688 --> 00:11:41,888
So, Inspector Nakamori,

219
00:11:41,888 --> 00:11:43,488
it's show time!

220
00:11:43,488 --> 00:11:45,488
Check out all the faces of everyone here

221
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:47,588
excluding the children and...

222
00:11:47,588 --> 00:11:50,188
There's something I'd like to make clear before that.

223
00:11:51,388 --> 00:11:54,188
Let me explain how Thief Kid took the amber horns

224
00:11:54,188 --> 00:11:57,388
from the statue of the giraffe.

225
00:11:57,388 --> 00:12:00,699
Just before the black-out, unless you insert

226
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:04,488
and turn the white, black, red and green keys

227
00:12:04,488 --> 00:12:06,188
that you nailed onto the wall of this room of the pedestals

228
00:12:06,188 --> 00:12:11,188
that are in the four corners of the room

229
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,788
at the same time...

230
00:12:14,988 --> 00:12:17,388
nobody could view the statue of the giraffe

231
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:20,488
that is hidden in the pillar in the center.

232
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:24,723
If by chance, Thief Kid got himself a spare somehow...

233
00:12:24,888 --> 00:12:26,188
How in the world did he, in the dark,

234
00:12:26,188 --> 00:12:27,988
where the pedestals nor the keyholes

235
00:12:27,988 --> 00:12:30,488
were in view do what he did?

236
00:12:30,488 --> 00:12:34,288
As for light, the little ones had it on them, didn't they?

237
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:36,735
The one on their watches!

238
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,737
Since they said they would be guarding pedestal,

239
00:12:38,988 --> 00:12:41,788
Thief Kid probably used that light to do.

240
00:12:41,788 --> 00:12:44,088
We didn't turn on the light!

241
00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:46,188
It's true that we were covering the keyhole

242
00:12:46,188 --> 00:12:48,288
like this though.

243
00:12:48,288 --> 00:12:50,488
Because Ai told us not to turn on the light

244
00:12:50,488 --> 00:12:52,488
even if the lights went out.

245
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:55,188
And, while you were covering the keyhole,

246
00:12:55,188 --> 00:12:56,755
did anyone come?

247
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:59,088
-No! -What?

248
00:12:59,088 --> 00:13:00,788
This keyhole...

249
00:13:00,788 --> 00:13:02,088
Something's glowing.

250
00:13:02,088 --> 00:13:03,088
What?

251
00:13:05,588 --> 00:13:08,188
This is florescent paint.

252
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:12,088
Inspector, there's florescent on the keyhole on this side too.

253
00:13:12,088 --> 00:13:13,188
Which means...

254
00:13:13,188 --> 00:13:15,088
No way!

255
00:13:15,088 --> 00:13:16,388
Just as I thought.

256
00:13:16,388 --> 00:13:20,088
There's florescent paint on the tip of all four keys.

257
00:13:20,088 --> 00:13:21,688
It probably got on there

258
00:13:21,688 --> 00:13:24,288
when the key was stuck into the keyhole.

259
00:13:24,288 --> 00:13:25,588
Which means, he was guided

260
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:27,688
by the slightest light of the keyhole.

261
00:13:27,688 --> 00:13:28,787
Yes.

262
00:13:28,988 --> 00:13:31,288
He gave all his accomplices the keys in the dark

263
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:33,188
and made them insert them into the glowing keyhole,

264
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:34,488
then turn all the keys at the same time,

265
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:40,388
then stole the horns of the giraffe, right?

266
00:13:40,388 --> 00:13:42,388
Mr. Thief Kid!

267
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,088
What me?

268
00:13:45,088 --> 00:13:47,288
Isn't it so?

269
00:13:47,288 --> 00:13:49,888
It's an obvious fact that the keys

270
00:13:49,888 --> 00:13:53,488
that were used weren't spare keys but these keys.

271
00:13:53,488 --> 00:13:54,488
In other words,

272
00:13:54,488 --> 00:14:00,288
you nailed the keys on very lightly

273
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:05,288
so that after using them you could put them back really easily.

274
00:14:05,288 --> 00:14:07,988
Then, try pulling that metal out.

275
00:14:07,988 --> 00:14:11,088
It won't come off that easily.

276
00:14:11,088 --> 00:14:14,833
You probably nailed it back firmly when you returned the keys.

277
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:16,388
If you're going as far as to say that,

278
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,837
why don't you check my body?

279
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:20,839
If I'm Thief Kid, I should still have

280
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:22,288
the horns of the giraffe on me.

281
00:14:22,288 --> 00:14:24,588
Yes, even if you don't tell me,

282
00:14:24,588 --> 00:14:25,688
that's exactly what I'm planning to do...

283
00:14:25,688 --> 00:14:26,845
Wait.

284
00:14:27,088 --> 00:14:30,388
Will you let us, the Youth Detective Squad

285
00:14:30,388 --> 00:14:33,188
do the body check?

286
00:14:33,188 --> 00:14:35,688
If you, Inspector or the advisor is Thief Kid

287
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:37,588
and his accomplices,

288
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:40,488
you may fake checking and deceive us.

289
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:41,688
Exactly.

290
00:14:41,688 --> 00:14:43,488
We can be trusted.

291
00:14:43,488 --> 00:14:46,865
We're for sure not Thief Kid's accomplice.

292
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:48,867
That's true.

293
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:51,288
We'll be checking all the others too,

294
00:14:51,288 --> 00:14:52,888
but that's okay, right?

295
00:14:52,888 --> 00:14:53,888
Yes.

296
00:14:57,288 --> 00:15:01,188
"We will be making some changes in the program.

297
00:15:01,188 --> 00:15:03,888
Please wait a moment," it says.

298
00:15:03,888 --> 00:15:06,888
This telop has been streaming from some time ago.

299
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:09,188
It's sure taking long for the program to restart.

300
00:15:09,188 --> 00:15:12,288
I wonder what that strange sound was, though?

301
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:14,888
It was sure unpleasant to the ears.

302
00:15:14,888 --> 00:15:17,688
What? Was there such a sound?

303
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:25,188
What?

304
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:28,588
You checked all the people in this temple building

305
00:15:28,588 --> 00:15:31,588
but the giraffe's horn is nowhere in sight?

306
00:15:31,588 --> 00:15:35,588
No. We thought that maybe it may secretly

307
00:15:35,588 --> 00:15:36,915
have been put into our clothes and pockets too,

308
00:15:37,088 --> 00:15:38,488
so we checked our clothes

309
00:15:38,488 --> 00:15:40,919
as well as the pockets of Conan's clothes but couldn't find it.

310
00:15:41,088 --> 00:15:42,921
It's strange.

311
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:44,688
The bars of the windows were made

312
00:15:44,688 --> 00:15:46,925
with a width that the giraffe's horn couldn't pass through,

313
00:15:47,088 --> 00:15:48,588
so even if his accomplices were to be outside,

314
00:15:48,588 --> 00:15:50,088
he couldn't have given it to them.

315
00:15:50,088 --> 00:15:52,188
That's why...

316
00:15:52,188 --> 00:15:54,688
Thief Kid's already fled.

317
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:57,288
Open the door up right away so we can go after him.

318
00:15:57,288 --> 00:15:58,937
No, but...

319
00:15:59,188 --> 00:16:02,941
It's true. That since the treasure

320
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:04,588
that he was after is no longer here,

321
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:08,388
so it's most natural to think that he's gone,

322
00:16:08,388 --> 00:16:10,488
but I just don't get it.

323
00:16:10,488 --> 00:16:13,588
I wonder why he knocked Conan out.

324
00:16:13,588 --> 00:16:15,588
Well, I guess getting rid of the one

325
00:16:15,588 --> 00:16:16,688
who is thought to be most difficult to handle,

326
00:16:16,688 --> 00:16:19,488
would make things way easier,

327
00:16:19,488 --> 00:16:21,888
but doing so, would deprive Thief Kid of the pleasure

328
00:16:21,888 --> 00:16:23,988
of feeling superior for carrying out what he'd done

329
00:16:23,988 --> 00:16:25,988
right in front of Conan's eyes.

330
00:16:25,988 --> 00:16:29,688
I wonder if he had some other reason?

331
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,588
And another thing that bothers me

332
00:16:31,588 --> 00:16:32,988
is this phrase written by Kichiemon Samizu

333
00:16:32,988 --> 00:16:35,388
that is carved on the pillar.

334
00:16:35,388 --> 00:16:37,388
"One who desires to acquire the giraffe

335
00:16:37,388 --> 00:16:39,488
without using the correct method,

336
00:16:39,488 --> 00:16:42,088
must move with the flow."

337
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:45,388
In other words, it means,

338
00:16:45,388 --> 00:16:47,588
anyone who tries to acquire the giraffe's horn,

339
00:16:47,588 --> 00:16:50,088
not using the proper method, must go with the flow.

340
00:16:50,088 --> 00:16:54,288
The proper method probably refers to the keys,

341
00:16:54,288 --> 00:16:55,988
but what is the flow?

342
00:16:57,288 --> 00:16:58,788
Wind?

343
00:16:58,788 --> 00:17:00,788
The flow of the wind?

344
00:17:00,788 --> 00:17:03,488
No. The wind is blowing now

345
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:05,788
because Thief Kid broke the shutters.

346
00:17:05,788 --> 00:17:08,188
That's right, why did Thief Kid open the window

347
00:17:08,188 --> 00:17:09,988
in the first place?

348
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,488
He caused a black-out

349
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,888
so it would've been meaningless for him to confuse us

350
00:17:13,888 --> 00:17:15,288
by bringing in the wind and rain.

351
00:17:16,288 --> 00:17:18,288
And, as Inspector Nakamori says,

352
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:21,588
if Advisor Suzuki were to be Thief Kid,

353
00:17:21,588 --> 00:17:24,488
to take the keys that are fixed

354
00:17:24,488 --> 00:17:27,488
to the wall in less than a minute, moreover in the dark.

355
00:17:27,488 --> 00:17:29,027
In addition to pass it around to his accomplices

356
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:30,188
without using any light at all.

357
00:17:30,188 --> 00:17:31,288
Then, without even giving a signal,

358
00:17:31,288 --> 00:17:33,031
have everyone insert and turn the key at the same time.

359
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:36,088
And finally make the treasure vanish as if by magic,

360
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,588
I wonder if doing something like that is possible.

361
00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:40,588
Besides, it's even dubious

362
00:17:40,588 --> 00:17:43,041
that Thief Kid had any accomplices with him.

363
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:46,288
If he brought that many accomplices to a closed up place like this,

364
00:17:46,288 --> 00:17:49,988
it's very likely that at least one of them would be caught.

365
00:17:49,988 --> 00:17:53,051
I would avoid any such risk at all cost.

366
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:55,053
No good.

367
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:57,588
I'm not good at things like this after all.

368
00:17:57,588 --> 00:18:00,788
I'm sure that this is what you'd say.

369
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,061
"You can't even figure out something as simple as that?"

370
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:05,988
Or, something to that effect.

371
00:18:05,988 --> 00:18:07,065
You'd probably keep on going at it like a sparrow,

372
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:08,388
tweet-tweeting on forever,

373
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:10,788
lining all your know-it-all knowledge.

374
00:18:10,788 --> 00:18:11,988
Sparrow...

375
00:18:14,088 --> 00:18:19,077
Maybe the "sparrow" is some kind of hint to that phrase.

376
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:21,079
Why?

377
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:23,688
It's almost completely erased,

378
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:25,083
but the word "sparrow"

379
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,688
was carved on that red pedestal.

380
00:18:27,688 --> 00:18:29,788
No joke.

381
00:18:29,788 --> 00:18:31,988
Red sparrow...

382
00:18:31,988 --> 00:18:33,088
"Vermilion Bird".

383
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:43,101
It's true. The word "sparrow" can be seen.

384
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:47,388
Then, maybe there was a statue of a sparrow here.

385
00:18:47,388 --> 00:18:49,588
It's not sparrow.

386
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:51,688
Red is the vermilion color.

387
00:18:51,688 --> 00:18:53,888
If the character written on top of the character sparrow

388
00:18:53,888 --> 00:18:55,588
had been erase is the character "Zhu"

389
00:18:55,588 --> 00:18:57,115
that symbolizes the vermilion color.

390
00:18:57,288 --> 00:18:59,117
It is the legendary deity,

391
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:01,119
one of the four gods is the Vermilion Bird.

392
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:03,388
"Vermilion Bird"

393
00:19:03,388 --> 00:19:05,123
The vermilion bird is...

394
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:07,125
The one that comes out a lot in games.

395
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,588
The red bird that looks like the Phoenix.

396
00:19:09,588 --> 00:19:13,131
Yes. And the white pedestal

397
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:15,788
to the right of the red pedestal facing it,

398
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,135
is the White Tiger.

399
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:20,288
"White Tiger"

400
00:19:20,288 --> 00:19:23,141
The black pedestal to its right on the side is...

401
00:19:23,388 --> 00:19:25,143
the Black Tortoise.

402
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:26,888
"Black Tortoise"

403
00:19:27,888 --> 00:19:29,588
And the one to the right on the side,

404
00:19:29,588 --> 00:19:31,149
that is to the left of the first red pedestal,

405
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:34,688
on top of the green pedestal,

406
00:19:34,688 --> 00:19:37,155
it may be safe and correct to say

407
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:38,888
that the statue of the Blue Dragon was there.

408
00:19:38,888 --> 00:19:40,488
Please wait.

409
00:19:40,488 --> 00:19:43,588
It's called the Blue Dragon, isn't it?

410
00:19:43,588 --> 00:19:46,288
But, the color of the pedestal is green.

411
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:47,588
The word "green"

412
00:19:47,588 --> 00:19:49,188
originally referred to the lush green

413
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,188
tree-line mountains, green trees and plants.

414
00:19:52,188 --> 00:19:56,588
The true color of the dragon is said to be green.

415
00:19:56,588 --> 00:20:01,188
The four deities each protect a certain direction,

416
00:20:01,188 --> 00:20:02,688
The Vermilion Bird is the guardian of the South.

417
00:20:02,688 --> 00:20:04,288
The White Tiger guards the West.

418
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:05,888
The Black Tortoise guards the North.

419
00:20:05,888 --> 00:20:07,588
And, the Blue Dragon, the East.

420
00:20:07,588 --> 00:20:10,888
And the one that is positioned in the middle is...

421
00:20:10,888 --> 00:20:12,488
this giraffe.

422
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:17,195
So, the sentence that was written by Kichiemon Samizu

423
00:20:17,195 --> 00:20:19,788
at the foot of the pillar means...

424
00:20:19,788 --> 00:20:24,788
Well, it's a sort of after-care for in case

425
00:20:24,788 --> 00:20:27,588
at a later time, the keys are lost or stolen.

426
00:20:27,588 --> 00:20:30,588
The first part, "One who desires to acquire the giraffe

427
00:20:30,588 --> 00:20:32,188
without using the correct method" means...

428
00:20:32,188 --> 00:20:33,888
Anyone who wants to get a hold of the giraffe's horn

429
00:20:33,888 --> 00:20:35,488
without relying on the keys.

430
00:20:35,488 --> 00:20:40,088
That follows behind means

431
00:20:40,088 --> 00:20:44,188
the flow of the moving of places and time.

432
00:20:44,188 --> 00:20:46,488
In other words, it can also be interpreted

433
00:20:46,488 --> 00:20:50,788
as to let things just be, but...

434
00:20:50,788 --> 00:20:52,888
So, if we stay here and do nothing,

435
00:20:52,888 --> 00:20:55,233
is the giraffe going to come out of the pillar?

436
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:56,488
No.

437
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,388
If the four pedestals that are placed in the four corners

438
00:20:58,388 --> 00:21:00,088
of this room each stand for the Vermilion Bird,

439
00:21:00,088 --> 00:21:02,888
White Tiger, Black Tortoise and Blue Dragon

440
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:04,288
it may have something to do

441
00:21:04,288 --> 00:21:05,788
with the color each deity symbolizes,

442
00:21:05,788 --> 00:21:07,988
as well as the direction.

443
00:21:07,988 --> 00:21:10,388
Right. I think we're suppose to do something

444
00:21:10,388 --> 00:21:11,788
to keep in the flow of the four pedestals

445
00:21:11,788 --> 00:21:13,588
by doing something in a given order.

446
00:21:13,588 --> 00:21:15,888
There is no order to the color.

447
00:21:15,888 --> 00:21:17,988
Maybe we're supposed to do something

448
00:21:17,988 --> 00:21:20,588
in the order of east, west south and north?

449
00:21:20,588 --> 00:21:23,988
But, they have the "east-north".

450
00:21:23,988 --> 00:21:24,988
Northeast district too.

451
00:21:24,988 --> 00:21:26,388
Isn't the direction next to east supposed to be north?

452
00:21:26,388 --> 00:21:28,688
I think north comes first.

453
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:32,188
Because north is located at the very top on every map.

454
00:21:32,188 --> 00:21:34,288
I guess just the direction won't help us in figuring out

455
00:21:34,288 --> 00:21:35,988
what order something should be done.

456
00:21:35,988 --> 00:21:38,188
Be it clockwise or counter clockwise,

457
00:21:38,188 --> 00:21:40,088
the flow is the flow.

458
00:21:40,088 --> 00:21:42,588
True. I hope there is some kind of set order

459
00:21:42,588 --> 00:21:44,388
to the Vermilion Bird, White Tiger,

460
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:47,285
Black Tortoise and Blue Dragon.

461
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:49,988
If it were Conan, he may know something.

462
00:21:49,988 --> 00:21:52,988
He's been asleep for a while now.

463
00:21:52,988 --> 00:21:53,988
At any rate,

464
00:21:53,988 --> 00:21:57,088
in order to make the giraffe appear from out of this pillar,

465
00:21:57,088 --> 00:21:58,888
we've got no choice but to insert keys into the keyholes

466
00:21:58,888 --> 00:22:01,788
of the four pedestals and turn them at the same time

467
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:02,988
or without using the keys,

468
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,588
do something to the four pedestals in a certain order.

469
00:22:06,588 --> 00:22:08,588
There is no other possible way to do it.

470
00:22:08,588 --> 00:22:11,309
It would be impossible for Thief Kid alone to do something like that

471
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:14,388
within the one minute of the time the place blacked out.

472
00:22:14,388 --> 00:22:15,788
If he had any accomplices,

473
00:22:15,788 --> 00:22:18,688
he would've had to give out some kind of signal.

474
00:22:18,688 --> 00:22:20,888
Let's check on that, first of all.

475
00:22:20,888 --> 00:22:23,321
Check on it, how?

476
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,888
They're here, aren't they?

477
00:22:24,888 --> 00:22:29,088
The TV crew that is taking evidence

478
00:22:29,088 --> 00:22:32,288
filled VTR shots.

479
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:36,088
Conan, I guess we have no choice

480
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,335
but to do what we can

481
00:22:37,335 --> 00:22:40,088
on our own until you wake up.

482
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

483
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,840
"Genta's 10 yen size baldness"

484
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,958
There are times when Genta leads us to clues too.

485
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:10,640
That sure is a bald "bold" remark.
