Please! Re-investigate my older sister's suicide case!

3
00:00:07,044 --> 00:00:09,644
Well, well, please take it easy.

4
00:00:09,644 --> 00:00:11,544
First of all, please give me your name.

5
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:13,244
Oh, yes.

"Misaki Yanai (17)" -I am Misaki Yanai.

7
00:00:16,244 --> 00:00:18,644
I was going to the same school as Sonoko

8
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:20,644
and Ran until intermediate school.

9
00:00:20,644 --> 00:00:22,944
And, from high school

10
00:00:22,944 --> 00:00:24,644
she went to Seimi Yanai Academy

11
00:00:24,644 --> 00:00:26,944
where her mother is chairman.

12
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:30,344
I see. To Seimi Yanai Academy?

13
00:00:30,344 --> 00:00:33,244
And? You have doubts about your older sister's suicide?

14
00:00:33,244 --> 00:00:35,644
Yes! Nagisa...

15
00:00:35,644 --> 00:00:38,744
My older sister would never commit suicide!

16
00:00:38,744 --> 00:00:41,044
But, the if the police concluded it as suicide,

17
00:00:41,044 --> 00:00:44,023
they would've had to come up with evidence to prove it.

18
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:46,025
There were two eye-witnesses.

19
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:49,544
I see. Eye-witnesses.

20
00:00:49,544 --> 00:00:52,344
One of them is me.

21
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,033
I see...

22
00:00:55,344 --> 00:00:58,037
But, that's a mistake!

23
00:00:58,037 --> 00:00:59,144
Well...

24
00:00:59,144 --> 00:01:00,644
Please!

25
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,644
Please prove that my older sister didn't commit suicide!

26
00:01:03,644 --> 00:01:07,044

"Girls' Academy's Window"

35
00:03:11,838 --> 00:03:15,138
Yeah. Forensics were sure too.

36
00:03:15,138 --> 00:03:18,938
They declared that Ms. Nagisa Yanai unmistakably committed suicide.

37
00:03:18,938 --> 00:03:20,179
Just as I thought, after all.

38
00:03:20,338 --> 00:03:22,838
Thank you very much, Inspector.

39
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:27,338
So, Inspector Megure told me.

40
00:03:27,338 --> 00:03:29,438
I know!

41
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:32,191
That's why I came to see you Detective Mouri.

Geez!

Hey. Help me.

45
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:38,738
Hey, Pops.

46
00:03:38,738 --> 00:03:42,201
Why don't you at least ask her what she witnessed?

47
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:44,203
I guess so.

48
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:48,938
At any rate, calm down. Tell him exactly what you saw.

49
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:50,738
Yep. I'll do that.

50
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:52,938
I'm just going to hear you out, okay, Miss.

51
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:56,215
At sundown 5 days ago.

52
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:58,217
Just around 18:00.

54
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:03,638
and told that she wanted to talk to me.

55
00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:05,338
Ms. Kodama?

56
00:04:05,338 --> 00:04:07,738
Yes, she's my advisor for both my high school

57
00:04:07,738 --> 00:04:10,738
and university drama club.

58
00:04:10,738 --> 00:04:13,738
My older sister and I both belong to the drama club.

59
00:04:13,738 --> 00:04:18,038
My older sister was scheduled to play the main actress

60
00:04:18,038 --> 00:04:21,238
at next year's academy foundation day festival.

62

early next year, I'm still not decided on the program.

63
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:30,938
To put it simply, it's whether it should be a comedy or tragedy.

64
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,138
Yes, I heard about it from my sister.

65
00:04:33,138 --> 00:04:36,038
That if it's for foundation day, it should have a happy ending

66
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:37,238
or you have to touch the hearts of people

67
00:04:37,238 --> 00:04:39,538
and bring it to a climax with acting skills.

68
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:41,738
Nagisa is also undecided.

69
00:04:41,738 --> 00:04:45,838
That's why I wanted to hear what you have to say too.

70
00:04:45,838 --> 00:04:47,438
But, she sure is late.

71
00:04:47,438 --> 00:04:50,269
Nagisa told me to wait here.

72
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:52,271
What?

73
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:55,138
That's the model art crafts club, isn't it?

74
00:04:55,138 --> 00:04:57,338
I'm sure all the club members have left though.

75
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,279
Maybe it's the advisor, Mr. Shibagaki?

76
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:04,938
He's supposed be having a meeting with the chairman from 17:30.

77
00:05:11,138 --> 00:05:12,738
Sis?

78
00:05:12,738 --> 00:05:15,438
Ms. Yanai? Why is she...

79
00:05:16,638 --> 00:05:17,838
What's she trying to do?

80
00:05:17,838 --> 00:05:19,038

82

hook the rope up?

83
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:25,638
The beams in that room are all plain to see.

84
00:05:25,638 --> 00:05:27,538
Sis! Sis!

85
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:30,309
No good, it's sound proof!

86
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:35,738
No!

87
00:05:42,838 --> 00:05:44,323
It's locked!

88

Today of all days!

89
00:05:45,738 --> 00:05:48,338
That's right, call the chairman's room!

90
00:05:48,338 --> 00:05:50,329
Yes!

91
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:52,331
Was the chairman's room nearby?

92
00:05:52,538 --> 00:05:55,738
Yes. It was way faster than for us to go around

93
00:05:55,738 --> 00:05:58,638
to the front gate. Besides, it's on the same 2nd floor.

94
00:05:58,638 --> 00:06:01,138
So, your mother was there.

95
00:06:01,138 --> 00:06:04,138
And the teacher called Shibagaki, too.

96
00:06:07,738 --> 00:06:08,938
Hello.

97
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:11,738
What is it about?

98
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,938
Sis is in trouble!

99
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:17,338
The model art crafts club. Hurry! Come quick!

100
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:30,738
Nagisa! Nagisa!

101
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:33,738
Why did you do something like this?

102
00:06:33,738 --> 00:06:37,438
That teacher called Shibagaki, was he your sister's boyfriend?

103
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,438
He's the chairman in charge of finances at the academy

104
00:06:39,438 --> 00:06:43,038
and they were planning to get married after her sister's graduation.

105
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:45,338
"Touichirou Shibagaki (26)" -How can you leave without me?

106
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,387
It's ridiculous, I can't believe it!

107
00:06:53,238 --> 00:06:54,938
Hey, Misaki.

108
00:06:54,938 --> 00:06:56,395
Why did you think that it wasn't what it seemed like

109
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:58,397
despite having witnessed the scene?

110
00:06:58,638 --> 00:07:00,938
I guess you have a reason for it, wasn't it?

111
00:07:00,938 --> 00:07:03,638
Your sister had a lover that she was going to get married to, too.

112
00:07:03,638 --> 00:07:07,038
So wasn't she having the best time of her life?

113
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:10,409
True. I wonder if she's commit suicide at a time like that.

114
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:14,413
The problem was with that lover of hers, though.

115
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:15,838
What do you mean?

116
00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:20,419
Mr. Shibagaki attended the same university as Ms. Kodama.

117
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:22,838
They used to be in love with each other previously.

118
00:07:22,838 --> 00:07:25,238
She's the teacher that witnessed the scene with you, right?

119
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:27,838
Huh? Then maybe he was two-timing?

120
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:31,038
-Yes. -Did they admit to their relationship?

121
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:33,338
The investigation of the police revealed it so,

122
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:35,738
Mr. Shibazaki did though unwillingly.

123
00:07:35,738 --> 00:07:38,738
And, what's Ms. Kodama saying about it?

124
00:07:38,738 --> 00:07:40,438
What's with this boy?

125
00:07:41,638 --> 00:07:44,138
He's a precocious brat. Don't let him bother you.

126
00:07:44,138 --> 00:07:46,238
But, he can be sharp at times.

127
00:07:46,238 --> 00:07:48,038
Only at times?

128
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:51,138
And, what did Ms. Kodama say?

129
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:54,038
She did admit that they used to be lovers before.

130
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:57,138
But, she says they parted once and for all already.

131
00:07:57,138 --> 00:07:58,738
I wonder.

132
00:07:58,738 --> 00:08:01,638
To think that the two are working at the same school.

133
00:08:01,638 --> 00:08:05,938
So, Nagisa, who troubled over this, committed suicide. Maybe.

134
00:08:05,938 --> 00:08:10,469
No, she would never commit suicide without saying anything.

135
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:13,938
She would've slammed the wedding ring back at the betrayer.

136
00:08:13,938 --> 00:08:16,475
She would've done that at least, my sister.

137
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:18,138
But...

138
00:08:18,138 --> 00:08:19,738
Is something bothering you?

139
00:08:19,738 --> 00:08:21,638
You found out about that scandal

140
00:08:21,638 --> 00:08:24,138
only after the police investigated it, didn't you?

141
00:08:24,138 --> 00:08:26,485
How did your sister find out about it?

142
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:28,487
Yeah, that's true.

143
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:29,838
That's true.

144
00:08:29,838 --> 00:08:34,493
That's right. Besides I got this from big sis.

145
00:08:34,738 --> 00:08:37,738
See, it's carved Nagisa.

146
00:08:37,738 --> 00:08:41,838
She asked me to go get the size adjusted at the shop she bought it from.

147
00:08:41,838 --> 00:08:44,503
-When was this? -The day she committed suicide.

148
00:08:46,038 --> 00:08:50,509
In other words, Nagisa still didn't know about Shibagaki and his ex-lover.

149
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:51,838
Not only that,

150
00:08:51,838 --> 00:08:53,138
she said that she wanted to keep the bracelet on

151
00:08:53,138 --> 00:08:55,238
even after she got married.

152
00:08:55,238 --> 00:08:57,938
You sister was full of happiness, wasn't she?

153
00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:02,521
That's why I can't believe that she committed suicide!

154
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:05,638
But you saw with your very eyes

155
00:09:05,638 --> 00:09:08,527
that your sister committed suicide.

156
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:10,529
No!

157
00:09:14,738 --> 00:09:16,238
The rope that was used

158
00:09:16,238 --> 00:09:20,338
was what the model art crafts club had prepared for packing.

159
00:09:20,338 --> 00:09:21,938
The stool that she used for a step ladder

160
00:09:21,938 --> 00:09:25,538
was knocked over in the corner of the room by the partition screen.

161
00:09:25,538 --> 00:09:28,547
Since there were casters on the stool

162
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:32,838
it probably rolled some distance after it was kicked.

163
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,838
But, this is really something.

164
00:09:34,838 --> 00:09:37,338
Is this the model of Seimi Yanai Academy?

165
00:09:37,338 --> 00:09:39,338
Did the students make all these?

166
00:09:39,338 --> 00:09:43,438
We all made it together, but the advisor probably also helped.

167
00:09:43,438 --> 00:09:45,638
Oh, you mean Mr. Shibagaki?

168
00:09:45,638 --> 00:09:50,138
Yes. He's a model making freak and a war maniac.

169
00:09:50,138 --> 00:09:52,038
So, he donated his own collection for exhibition, too.

170
00:09:52,038 --> 00:09:54,238
I think he donated a lot of it, too.

171
00:09:54,238 --> 00:09:55,938
Wow!

172
00:09:55,938 --> 00:09:58,577
This is the radio controlled model of war tank Elefant (Elephant)

173
00:09:58,738 --> 00:10:00,838
that was developed in Germany in World War II.

174
00:10:00,838 --> 00:10:03,038
You're really knowledgeable.

175
00:10:03,038 --> 00:10:04,038
Sort of.

176
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:06,238
You're a boy after all.

177
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:10,589
As a girl, this is more like it.

178
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:14,593
Mr. Mouri, hello.

179
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:17,738
Takagi, is it all right to bring that picture along with you?

180
00:10:17,738 --> 00:10:19,638
Don't blame me if the Inspector gets on you.

181
00:10:19,638 --> 00:10:22,601
Well, since we found that this was not a homicide case.

182
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:26,605
But these kids are saying that it's not suicide.

183
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:28,607
Oh, I see.

184
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:30,609
What do you mean, "I see"?

185
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:31,538
Listen.

186
00:10:31,538 --> 00:10:33,338
What's suspicious in cases like these

187
00:10:33,338 --> 00:10:36,638
is that somebody gains from the death of the victim!

188
00:10:36,638 --> 00:10:38,617
But, in this case,

189
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:41,438
almost everybody lost out instead of make gains.

190
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:44,623
Ms. Kodama and Mr. Shibagaki were suspected of scandal,

191
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:47,438
while Chairman Yanai, because of shock from losing her daughter,

192
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,938
is saying that she wants to close down Seimi Academy.

193
00:10:49,938 --> 00:10:53,138
Let's say, even if there were to be a culprit, no one made out.

194
00:10:53,138 --> 00:10:55,138
There would be no reason to cause the incident.

195
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:56,438
Alright.

196
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:58,637
What is it, Conan?

197
00:10:58,637 --> 00:11:00,938
Did you find anything that bothers you?

198
00:11:02,338 --> 00:11:05,038
The pictures aren't enough,

199
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:07,438
so let's go to the site!

200
00:11:07,438 --> 00:11:09,238
-To the site? -Yep.

201
00:11:09,238 --> 00:11:12,438
Then we may be able to find something, right?

202
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:15,938
It's okay to go, isn't it, Officer Takagi?

203
00:11:15,938 --> 00:11:18,438
Yeah. It's not really closed off or anything

204
00:11:18,438 --> 00:11:19,838
so it should be okay.

205
00:11:19,838 --> 00:11:21,338
I'm not going.

206
00:11:21,338 --> 00:11:25,238
Okay, we'll report to you later then, Pops.

207
00:11:34,331 --> 00:11:36,031
It's about time.

208
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:38,031
Oh, there she is.

209
00:11:41,631 --> 00:11:44,031
Get serious!

210
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:46,231
Talk about hopeless.

211
00:11:48,431 --> 00:11:50,331
Wait.

212
00:11:50,331 --> 00:11:53,631
Back then, all of Sis' face was in clear view.

213
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:55,531
Okay, I'll go tell her that then.

214
00:11:55,531 --> 00:11:57,031
I'll call you on the cell phone.

215
00:11:57,031 --> 00:11:58,697
Okay.

216
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:04,703
Back then, the front entrance was locked, right?

217
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:05,831
Yeah.

218
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:09,931
Will going back this much do?

219
00:12:09,931 --> 00:12:13,231
Yep, right. Try getting on.

220
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:19,131
How about this time?

221
00:12:19,131 --> 00:12:20,731
That's just the place!

222
00:12:20,731 --> 00:12:22,031
Okay.

223
00:12:35,431 --> 00:12:37,731
Is this the trace of a crawler?

224
00:12:37,731 --> 00:12:40,739
It must've crashed pretty badly.

225
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,745
Hey.

226
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:49,531
Can we finish replaying the scene?

227
00:12:49,531 --> 00:12:50,531
Oh, yep.

228
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:51,631
Then...

229
00:12:59,931 --> 00:13:01,831
Are you okay?

230
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:04,531
If you think so, hurry and get off of me!

231
00:13:04,531 --> 00:13:06,031
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:09,531
Yes, this is the Mouri Detective Agency.

233
00:13:09,531 --> 00:13:11,231
Oh, Misaki?

234
00:13:11,231 --> 00:13:15,931
As to that case. As we mentioned the other day, our office...

235
00:13:15,931 --> 00:13:18,331
Yes, I know.

236
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:22,781
But... Unless you come and actually talk to me at the site.

237
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:25,531
My mother and I cannot be convinced.

238
00:13:25,531 --> 00:13:27,831
But, even so...

239
00:13:27,831 --> 00:13:31,431
Please, just explaining will do.

240
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:34,793
All right.

241
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:36,331
Thank you very much!

242
00:13:36,331 --> 00:13:38,797
But, mind you, I'm just going over to explain.

243
00:13:39,031 --> 00:13:41,531
Yes, sir! I'm looking forward to seeing you!

244
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:43,631
See you later, then.

245
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:46,431
Well, in other words, I'm doing it

246
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:50,131
just to convince that girl and make her give up what she's doing.

247
00:13:50,131 --> 00:13:52,811
This is also one of the duties of a great detective!

248
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:56,531
What on earth is Mr. Mouri thinking of starting?

249
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:57,931
Haven't you heard anything?

250
00:13:57,931 --> 00:14:02,331
No. He just said, you'll know if you come.

251
00:14:02,331 --> 00:14:04,823
We're busy getting ready to close down the school now

252
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:06,825
and can't spare much time.

253
00:14:07,031 --> 00:14:09,531
Well, sorry to keep you waiting.

254
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:14,331
What brings you here, Inspector?

255
00:14:19,331 --> 00:14:20,839
Dad?

256
00:14:22,531 --> 00:14:26,031
He's already gotten into the Sleeping Kogoro mode!

257
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,847
Thank you for waiting, everyone.

258
00:14:29,031 --> 00:14:32,431
I am here of request from Ms. Misaki Yanai.

259
00:14:32,431 --> 00:14:35,131
That's already been solved!

260
00:14:35,131 --> 00:14:38,031
Of course I know that.

261
00:14:38,031 --> 00:14:40,859
It's true that the victim was thought to have committed suicide.

262
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:42,861
But, she committed suicide on the very day

263
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:44,863
that she asked her younger sister to go

264
00:14:44,863 --> 00:14:47,431
and adjust her bracelet for her.

265
00:14:47,431 --> 00:14:50,331
Isn't this a bit unnatural?

266
00:14:50,331 --> 00:14:53,931
As to that, I'm to blame for it.

267
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:57,831
Nagisa who found out that I betrayed her, probably impulsively...

268
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:03,831
Then when and how did Nagisa find out about it?

269
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:06,885
Well. Now that Nagisa is no longer here...

270
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:10,331
There is no way of knowing. I see.

271
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:13,231
By the way, I hear that Misaki, Ran and the others,

272
00:15:13,231 --> 00:15:16,031
replayed the scene of the incident to re-confirm things.

273
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:20,431
Sonoko, could you replay the scene for us again here now?

274
00:15:20,431 --> 00:15:22,901
You want us to do it again?

275
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:24,903
I'm sorry, but Mrs. Yanai,

276
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:27,931
please bear with us for a while longer.

277
00:15:27,931 --> 00:15:31,731
Sonoko, at first, put the step ladder in that position,

278
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:36,031
but it didn't match the position that Nagisa was witnessed from.

279
00:15:36,031 --> 00:15:37,331
In order to match the position,

280
00:15:37,331 --> 00:15:40,431
there was a need to pull more away from the window.

281
00:15:40,431 --> 00:15:42,931
Uh... About here.

282
00:15:43,931 --> 00:15:45,731
What about it?

283
00:15:45,731 --> 00:15:47,731
That's not the point.

284
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:50,929
She couldn't have committed suicide there.

285
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:53,931
Because at the time of the incident on that day...

286
00:15:55,231 --> 00:15:58,531
the model of Seimi Academy was placed there.

287
00:16:00,031 --> 00:16:03,331
Just to be sure, I'd like to ask you, Misaki.

288
00:16:03,331 --> 00:16:06,531
How much of the room space did the model crafts take up?

289
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:09,831
Oh, yes. Up to this line.

290
00:16:09,831 --> 00:16:14,131
As you can see, it's not possible to put the step ladder there.

291
00:16:14,131 --> 00:16:17,531
But if you avoid the model crafts and place the step ladder in position,

292
00:16:17,531 --> 00:16:20,231
it doesn't match the testimonies of the eye-witnesses.

293
00:16:20,231 --> 00:16:24,331
In order to make it come out the same by going near the window,

294
00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:26,965
a step ladder that is much lower was needed.

295
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:28,967
Hey, hey. The only thing

296
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:30,969
that could serve as a step ladder that was around was the stool.

297
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:33,731
Well, in fact there was something else.

298
00:16:33,731 --> 00:16:35,431
Uh, Inspector.

299
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:38,731
Why are you so stuck on the position she committed suicide?

300
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,431
It's almost like you're trying to determine where to stand on stage.

301
00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:42,981
Come to think of it,

302
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:45,931
back then, sis' face up to her hips were in view

303
00:16:45,931 --> 00:16:48,331
as if she had used a measure or something.

304
00:16:48,331 --> 00:16:50,431
I wonder if that was just a coincidence?

305
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,991
If that was not a coincidence then...

306
00:16:54,131 --> 00:16:58,031
If someone had told her what to do...

307
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:01,831
To make sure that the two in the yard could get a good view of her.

308
00:17:01,831 --> 00:17:03,831
You mean Sis committed suicide

309
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:06,431
making sure that we saw what she did?

310
00:17:06,431 --> 00:17:10,131
That's right, Nagisa wanted Ms. Kodama

311
00:17:10,131 --> 00:17:12,731
to watch her suicidal act.

312
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:16,031
Therefore, she chose the best position to do this.

313
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:20,331
Oh, so that's why she told me to wait at the bench in the courtyard.

314
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,531
So, that suicide was an act that Sis' put on?

315
00:17:23,531 --> 00:17:25,631
This is what Nagisa thought.

316
00:17:25,631 --> 00:17:27,531
She wanted the audience that came to see her

317
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:30,031
at the Foundation Festival, to watch her act.

318
00:17:30,031 --> 00:17:32,031
For that, she thought she had to

319
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:34,131
overwhelm Ms. Kodama with her performance.

320
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:35,033
If she succeeds,

321
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,631
even if it were to have a tragic ending,

322
00:17:37,631 --> 00:17:40,131
everyone who watches it would take to it.

323
00:17:40,131 --> 00:17:41,731
I understand...

324
00:17:41,731 --> 00:17:45,031
I'm sure Nagisa would've carried such a performance.

325
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:47,045
So, in this way,

326
00:17:47,231 --> 00:17:50,531
he lead the victim on with his skillful talk.

327
00:17:50,531 --> 00:17:52,631
The only one who could've done that is...

328
00:17:54,231 --> 00:17:56,031
Hey. Just what're you talking about?

329
00:17:56,031 --> 00:17:57,531
Nothing out of the ordinary.

330
00:17:57,531 --> 00:18:01,431
I never mentioned your name whatsoever yet.

331
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:06,031
There are several rows of benches in the courtyard,

332
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:07,431
but for some reason all the benches other than the ones

333
00:18:07,431 --> 00:18:09,067
that Misaki and Ms. Kodama sat on

334
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:12,131
had a "wet paint" sign on them.

335
00:18:12,131 --> 00:18:14,431
I heard from an employee

336
00:18:14,431 --> 00:18:19,431
that Mr. Shibagaki had asked to have them painted on that very day.

337
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,931
This way, the special seat to watch her performance from

338
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:25,083
was automatically set.

339
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:28,231
Moreover, for some reason only on that day,

340
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:31,089
the side entrance door was locked.

341
00:18:32,131 --> 00:18:35,093
And, who took care of the keys?

342
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:38,531
It's you, wasn't it, Mr. Shibagaki?

343
00:18:39,531 --> 00:18:41,099
But, Mr. Mouri,

344
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:43,831
let's say her suicide was in fact an act,

345
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,231
why did it turne out to be real?

346
00:18:46,231 --> 00:18:49,631
That's because the step ladder moved on its own.

347
00:18:49,631 --> 00:18:50,631
What?

348
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:53,631
The stool would've been too high to use as a step ladder,

349
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:57,431
therefore, the culprit told her to get on the war tank.

350
00:18:57,431 --> 00:18:58,731
A war tank?

351
00:18:59,731 --> 00:19:02,131
The Elefant war tank that was at the site?

352
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:06,131
Officer Takagi, would you please bring it over here?

353
00:19:06,131 --> 00:19:10,731
It's from Germany and made from aluminum die-casting.

354
00:19:10,731 --> 00:19:14,731
It is totally capable of supporting the weight of a woman.

355
00:19:14,731 --> 00:19:19,137
Which means that she used this war tank as a step ladder?

356
00:19:48,331 --> 00:19:51,731
6:00 in the evening, was probably the time

357
00:19:51,731 --> 00:19:55,173
that the victim was told to start the performance.

358
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:58,131
If the remote controller is used exactly at that time,

359
00:19:58,131 --> 00:20:01,731
there's no need to be in this room to move the war tank.

360
00:20:01,731 --> 00:20:03,831
Mr. Shibagaki, you were keying in

361
00:20:03,831 --> 00:20:06,931
the calculator back then with your left hand, weren't you?

362
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:09,531
You had your right hand in your pocket.

363
00:20:09,531 --> 00:20:11,189
What if you had the remote controller

364
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:14,331
in your pocket at that time?

365
00:20:14,331 --> 00:20:15,631
I've been framed!

366
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,931
I got a call from Misaki

367
00:20:17,931 --> 00:20:20,031
and was shocked to hear about Nagisa having committed suicide.

368
00:20:20,031 --> 00:20:21,731
I'm a victim too, you know.

369
00:20:21,731 --> 00:20:24,131
That's a lie! All I could say was rush over to the model art crafts club

370
00:20:24,131 --> 00:20:26,231
and yet...

371
00:20:26,231 --> 00:20:28,431
Sis' in trouble!

372
00:20:28,431 --> 00:20:31,831
In the model art crafts room. Hurry! Quick!

373
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:34,531
And yet, how did you know it was suicide?

374
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:37,231
That was just a slip of the tongue.

375
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:41,231
When you got to the site, was the step ladder there?

376
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:43,731
I saw it through the curtains by the partition screen,

377
00:20:43,731 --> 00:20:46,131
-if you're talking about the stool. -I see.

378
00:20:46,131 --> 00:20:48,831
In other words, you confirmed the step ladder

379
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,631
while you went in to save her.

380
00:20:51,631 --> 00:20:54,531
This is ridiculous! When I made my donation,

381
00:20:54,531 --> 00:20:57,235
I removed all the power source from all the models.

382
00:20:57,235 --> 00:20:59,231
I didn't want the students

383
00:20:59,231 --> 00:21:02,531
to tamper with my precious models, you see.

384
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:05,231
It's true that there seems to be no antennas in sight.

385
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:06,931
Of course not.

386
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:08,531
Thanks for your deduction,

387
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:10,631
but what doesn't move, doesn't move!

388
00:21:14,131 --> 00:21:15,931
It moved!

389
00:21:15,931 --> 00:21:19,257
I had Conan check on it beforehand.

390
00:21:19,257 --> 00:21:22,531
The antennas were modified to built-in types.

391
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,931
There are traces that the motors have been removed once,

392
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:29,731
but now they seem to have been put back on again.

393
00:21:29,731 --> 00:21:33,271
Could you answer what all this means?

394
00:21:41,731 --> 00:21:46,731
It seems that Mr. Shibagaki has finished retorting.

395
00:23:12,031 --> 00:23:16,431
Ms. Kodama seems to have confessed to the chairman.

396
00:23:16,431 --> 00:23:19,831
Mr. Shibagaki had been using the academy's finances

397
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:21,631
and was told to say nothing because he would give her a share of it.

398
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:24,031
That scared her, so she parted from him.

399
00:23:24,031 --> 00:23:25,383
If the academy goes bankrupt,

400
00:23:25,631 --> 00:23:28,431
the money he embezzled would also be thrown in the dark.

401
00:23:28,431 --> 00:23:30,131
So, the culprit was thinking in term

402
00:23:30,131 --> 00:23:32,931
of making gain for himself, after all.

403
00:23:34,731 --> 00:23:36,431
It seems that thanks to Misaki's support,

404
00:23:36,431 --> 00:23:38,731
her mother is back on her feet again.

405
00:23:38,731 --> 00:23:41,399
They're going to continue running this academy, then.

406
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,932
Next Conan Hint:

407
00:23:48,932 --> 00:23:51,032
"Hanging scroll"

408
00:23:51,032 --> 00:23:52,856
Even after the holidays is Kogoro week!

409
00:23:52,856 --> 00:23:54,092
All you're going to do is sleep because you don't have work, right?

410
00:23:54,092 --> 00:23:56,240
He's sleeping even when he works, though.
