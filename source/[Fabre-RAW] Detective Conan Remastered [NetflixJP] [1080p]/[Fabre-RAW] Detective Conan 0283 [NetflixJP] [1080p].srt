1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,470
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,470
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,970
Could something like this actually be done?

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,170
Shift ways of thinking for a quick and sharp solution.

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,570
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,670
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,270
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,410
Ran, Pops and I

9
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,410
were helped by Mr. Michiyoshi Majima, the president of Kiyama Furniture,

10
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,910
when we ran out of gas and got stuck on a mountain pass in Izu.

11
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,610
And the President, Mr. Majima invited us to stay at his house.

12
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,310
The house had a Rock Garden.

13
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,110
It was so constructed that water began to flow

14
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,710
and fill the garden at certain times of the day.

15
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,110
Meanwhile, as it happened to be the day of the

16
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,210
opening of the first store of Kiyama Furniture,

17
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,010
other guests also gathered there for a dinner party.

18
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,010
Mr. Masayuki Hashimoto, Secretary assigned to Mr. Majima,

19
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,210
Mr. Nobuaki Endo, the president of Kiyama Interior,

20
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,210
and Mr. Tomonori Kiyama, freelance writer

21
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,710
were the three guests there.

22
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,710
Though the party goes on,

23
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,210
Mr. Majima leaves in the middle of the party.

24
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,010
Mr. Kiyama also goes back to his room.

25
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,810
Then, a quarrel begins and the party soon takes on an ugly mood.

26
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,410
After that, Mr. Hashimoto leaves the dining hall,

27
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,510
saying that he is going back to his office.

28
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,010
Mr. Endo and Pops who stays, continues drinking.

29
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,710
The following morning...

30
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,610
Ma... President Majima.

31
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,310
President.

32
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,010
Keep out! This is a homicide!

33
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,410
Don't enter the garden! We've got to preserve the crime scene!

34
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,410
Don't you think there's something strange about his corpse?

35
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,410
Something strange? What's strange?

36
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,610
Around the body...

37
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,710
There are no footsteps at all.

38
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,110
True.

39
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,710
So, how did the murderer carry Mr. Majima up there?

40
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,310
"Mystery of the Japanese Water Flowing Rock Garden"

41
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,210
"(Part 2)"

42
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,610
What?

43
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,010
It looks like something was dragged.

44
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,410
Mr. Mouri.

45
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,110
There you are, Mr. Mouri.

46
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,610
Oh, you're Officer Yokomizo.

47
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,310
It's been a while.

48
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,210
But it's kind of funny

49
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,310
how I always run into you in a place like this.

50
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:56,610
The renowned detective should be where puzzling cases are.

51
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,810
Maybe I should just resign myself to my fate.

52
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,910
Anyway, this time again we're counting on your cooperation.

53
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,710
Officer Yokomizo, I've got a report from the coroner.

54
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,110
He died of asphyxiation from strangulation.

55
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,810
Approximate time of death,

56
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,310
last night, between 8 p.m. and 1 a.m.

57
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,410
His body was moved shortly after his death.

58
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,510
Considering that only parts of the dead body,

59
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,810
which were touching the ground, were wet,

60
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,810
his body was most likely carried here after 9 p.m. or later.

61
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,710
That is, the time of the crime

62
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:42,810
would've been somewhere between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m.

63
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,410
I see. I thought so.

64
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,210
Don't tell me that you've already found the murderer.

65
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:52,610
There's no such word as unsolved in my dictionary.

66
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,710
Are you for real...

67
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,710
Have you found the murderer?

68
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,210
Who? Who killed the president?

69
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,010
Oh, please ease up.

70
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,610
So, let's hear his explanation first.

71
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,110
Could you explain, Mr. Mouri?

72
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,910
Well, let me get your alibis straight.

73
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,210
First, Mr. Kiyama,

74
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:22,710
you got back to your room after the dinner party at 8 p.m.

75
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,610
and watched the video which you borrowed from Mr. Endo.

76
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,310
You went for a drive with Ran and Conan at 11.15 p.m.

77
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,410
and came back here at 1 a.m. after midnight.

78
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,710
Yes.

79
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,610
Mr. Hashimoto, after Mr. Kiyama left,

80
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,810
you went out the hall at about 8.10 p.m.

81
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,110
and went directly back to your office.

82
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,110
And this morning, you picked up my car and came back here.

83
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,610
That's right.

84
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,910
Mr. Endo, you stayed and drank with me until 9.30 p.m.

85
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,910
and after that you stayed in your room until this morning.

86
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,610
There's no doubt about that.

87
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,110
What is important here is what Ayaka said.

88
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,910
Ayaka finished putting things away

89
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:07,010
and got back to the staff room at 8.45 p.m.

90
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,810
She was stationed in the staff room until two o'clock.

91
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,710
During this time, Mr. Kiyama was the only person

92
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,410
who went in and out of the western style house,

93
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,410
to go view the night scenery.

94
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,710
Is that right, Ayaka?

95
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,110
Yes.

96
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,910
Looking around the house,

97
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,610
there was no sign that anyone had gone in or out through windows.

98
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,210
And it's impossible for anyone to go out of the house

99
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,710
without being seen by Ayaka.

100
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,710
That is, the crime occurred between 9 p.m. to 1 a.m.

101
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,110
those who spent their night here,

102
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:39,510
Mr. Endo, Ayaka and Mr. Kiyama who were with Ran and Conan,

103
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,010
have established alibis.

104
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,510
Which means...

105
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,110
That's right.

106
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,710
So I'll tell you straight that

107
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,710
the murderer is Mr. Hashimoto. You.

108
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,210
Me?

109
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:57,610
Mr. Majima bitterly urged you to repay your debt, right?

110
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,510
So, that doesn't...

111
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,110
You left the western style house,

112
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,210
saying that you'd be going back to your office.

113
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,810
You then broke into Mr. Majima's room

114
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,810
and killed him there.

115
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,010
Then you carried his body into this room.

116
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,910
Carried his body into this room?

117
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,410
He used the you-know-what.

118
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,410
What's this?

119
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,210
It's a catching pole for picking up objects

120
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,810
that have fallen into the garden.

121
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,610
Oh, you must be joking.

122
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,410
Mr. Hashimoto carried Mr. Majima here

123
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:38,210
tied him up atop the pole like this.

124
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,060
Mr. Mouri?

125
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,660
Just watch.

126
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:45,860
And Mr. Hashimoto carried the body like this.

127
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,460
Look at you.

128
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,460
Just a bit more.

129
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,460
Mr. Mouri.

130
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,860
No good, after all.

131
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,760
My only clue

132
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,360
is the trail that looks like something was dragged.

133
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,360
There seems to be no signs of tricks

134
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,960
built into the rocks in the garden.

135
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,760
Darn, how did the murderer carry Mr. Majima up there?

136
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,660
Excuse me, officer,

137
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,460
can we go now?

138
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,560
Mr. Kiyama and I are innocent

139
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,860
because we were in the western style house

140
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,060
at the time of the killing, you know.

141
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,260
That's true but...

142
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,160
I say, Mr. Mouri.

143
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,260
Shut up! I'm thinking now, just be quiet.

144
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,560
Officer Yokomizo.

145
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,360
I found something in the trash can in the dining hall.

146
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,360
This is... Mr. Mouri!

147
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,660
It says, if you want me to keep quiet about the accounting gimmick,

148
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,960
come up to the rooftop of the western style house

149
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,360
with this paper at eleven o'clock.

150
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,460
What?

151
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,860
Mr. Mouri.

152
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,860
Mr. Majima was killed not in the main house,

153
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,760
but maybe at the western style house.

154
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,060
But...

155
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,660
Ayaka, did you see Mr. Majima coming up to the western style house?

156
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,360
No.

157
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,060
Don't tell me you killed Mr. Majima.

158
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,460
No, I didn't.

159
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,260
Ayaka.

160
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,460
Please tell us the truth.

161
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,860
To tell the truth, I'm...

162
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,360
Tanuma's daughter.

163
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,060
Tanuma. So you are the daughter of the driver

164
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,060
who died in the accident with the former president?

165
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,560
Yes, the only reason I started working here

166
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,760
was because I wanted to confirm a rumor I heard about

167
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,060
Majima having rigged the car to make it look like an accident.

168
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,160
Mr. Endo knew about it.

169
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,160
And it was, I think, around 10.40 p.m.

170
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,360
Mr. Endo?

171
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,560
And he said, 'Give me money if you don't want Mr. Majima

172
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,260
to know who you are'.

173
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,560
I see.

174
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,060
At that time, she was looking at the picture of her father.

175
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,460
Is what she said true, Mr. Endo?

176
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:43,060
So, can you tell me what time Mr. Endo left?

177
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,960
I think it was a little past 11.

178
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,360
So, you might not have noticed Mr. Majima

179
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,660
coming to the western style house.

180
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,960
Maybe not.

181
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,160
It all sounds too perfect to be real.

182
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,760
I didn't kill him, I swear.

183
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,860
It will be clear before long.

184
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,060
Now, let's go to the rooftop.

185
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,460
Yes.

186
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,060
Mr. Mouri.

187
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,760
Oh, I can see the garden very well from up here.

188
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,460
I got it. I know who the murderer is.

189
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,760
So, after all, the criminal is...

190
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,360
The murderer is Mr. Endo. You.

191
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,160
You went over to Ayaka and closed the curtains,

192
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,660
so that Mr. Majima wouldn't be noticed going up to the roof.

193
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,060
You then, went to the roof where Mr. Majima was waiting,

194
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,460
and strangled him.

195
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,560
You used what you had set up beforehand,

196
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,060
then moved Mr. Majima over to the stone garden.

197
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,960
I see.

198
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,060
And, just what did he set up?

199
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,260
Archery.

200
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,560
Huh? Hey.

201
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,460
You got ready an arrow with a ring on its rear.

202
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,160
You pulled a long rope through the ring.

203
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,260
Then, you left both ends of the rope with you.

204
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,960
You then shot the arrow into the big tree

205
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,760
on the other side of the stone garden.

206
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,260
For you, who were a contestant on the national team,

207
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,760
it must've been an easy feat.

208
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,960
You hung Mr. Majima to that rope

209
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,660
and slid him over to the stone garden that way.

210
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,360
But Mr. Mouri,

211
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,460
if so, wouldn't the rope be left in the garden?

212
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,860
Oh, that's easy.

213
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,160
He tied one end of the rope which he kept at hand to the arrow

214
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,560
and shot the arrow into the grove over the rock garden.

215
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,060
Then the rope would be pulled by the arrow and fly off somewhere.

216
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,560
I'm willing to bet my career as a private detective on it.

217
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,160
The bow and the arrow that is tied to the rope

218
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,660
must be somewhere!

219
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,160
I'm not sure if you should've said that.

220
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,260
We found them!

221
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,460
We found the bow in Mr. Endo's room

222
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,460
and the arrow in the grove over the rock garden.

223
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,960
I'm proud of you, Dad.

224
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,360
That's impossible.

225
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,760
Strange.

226
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:31,660
If Pop is right, how can the dead body be lying in that way?

227
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,460
But, if he is wrong,

228
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,360
then how can I explain the bow and the arrow with the rope?

229
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,260
This is...

230
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,160
a ticket to Mr. Kiyama's photograph exhibition.

231
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,360
Why is it in a place like this?

232
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,160
I see. So, that's the story.

233
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,260
If my deduction is correct,

234
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,960
the killer is still supposed to have the stuff hidden somewhere.

235
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,360
Because that stuff's not so easy to get rid of.

236
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,460
I've found it.

237
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,360
Just as I thought.

238
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,260
All that's left now is the evidence.

239
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,360
What's this stain?

240
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,360
I see.

241
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,060
I've found conclusive evidence.

242
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,760
I was just about to put on a grand show.

243
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,760
I tell you that, Conan.

244
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,760
What could be so important?

245
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,060
I'll take care of things from here, Pops.

246
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,860
I can tell you that. I didn't kill him.

247
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,760
-Okay. -I didn't kill him.

248
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,060
-I'll hear you out at the police station. -I'm not the killer.

249
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,960
Officer Yokomizo.

250
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,860
What's up?

251
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,960
Mr. Mouri said he wanted all of us to gather at the rock garden room.

252
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,860
At the rock garden room?

253
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,960
He seems to have figured out who the criminal is.

254
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,960
What?

255
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,160
Mr. Mouri. What's this supposed to mean?

256
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,760
Mr. Endo is the criminal, isn't he?

257
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,560
That pose is...

258
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,060
Detective,

259
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,860
just as you said, I was going to kill Majima.

260
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,560
What? There you are!

261
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,860
But he didn't come.

262
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,860
-Believe me. -Stop lying!

263
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,460
I know, Mr. Endo.

264
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,460
The real murderer is someone else.

265
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,560
The true criminal is the person who knew in advance

266
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,860
about your murderous feelings towards Mr. Endo

267
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,060
and took advantage of it.

268
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,360
Don't you think it strange?

269
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,460
If Mr. Endo were the murderer,

270
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,760
why would he throw away only the subpoena,

271
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,660
in a separate place from his bow?

272
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,060
True.

273
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:54,260
The murderer took the subpoena from Mr. Majima's room

274
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,660
and threw it away on purpose, to publicize Mr. Endo's plan.

275
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,060
And if the dead body were carried from the roof,

276
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,960
in the manner that I just deduced a while ago,

277
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,660
no matter how you had him hanging by the rope

278
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,160
it would be impossible for him to be found the way he was,

279
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,260
on his stomach,

280
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,660
with his hands and feet in place as they were.

281
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,660
That's totally impossible.

282
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,560
Then, in what way was he carried?

283
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,460
Officer, will you please go and get that?

284
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,060
Yes.

285
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,360
Officer Yokomizo, here is.

286
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,660
An air mattress.

287
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,760
Now, what might that mean, Mr. Mouri?

288
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,360
Perhaps the time of the crime was about 8.30 p.m.

289
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,060
That's the time when water begins to flow into the garden.

290
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,160
Exactly.

291
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,760
After water filled with the garden, the murderer

292
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,960
tied the string to the air mattress

293
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,660
and set it afloat in the water

294
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,460
after putting the dead body of Mr. Majima on it.

295
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,460
Before long, the water began to drain away,

296
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,860
the water level went down

297
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,460
and just before the air mattress touched the sand,

298
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,460
the murderer held Mr. Majima's body

299
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,160
with the top end of the caching pole

300
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,360
and pulled the air mattress out full force.

301
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,360
That was the way the murderer put the dead body

302
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,460
in the middle of the rock garden

303
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,660
without leaving no marks on the sand.

304
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,460
Incidentally, the murderer left a mark on the stone

305
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,960
which was placed on the edge of the rock garden

306
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,960
when they pulled the air mattress out of the water.

307
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,760
The ticket probably fell out of his pocket

308
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,860
into the water at that time.

309
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,160
According to the forensics,

310
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:33,060
this scratch was made by the decorative button of his trousers.

311
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,460
So, who is the murderer?

312
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,060
I'm sure the murderer panicked

313
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,460
when we decided suddenly to spend the night here.

314
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,860
If Mr. Endo cancelled his plan,

315
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,960
everything would go down the drain.

316
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,760
So, the murderer tried to take us outside

317
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,160
at the time Mr. Endo called Mr. Majima.

318
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,560
Don't tell me...

319
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,560
The murderer is the one who took Ran and the others out

320
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,760
and made Mr. Endo carry out the murder plan.

321
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,060
It's you, Mr. Kiyama.

322
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,760
After he left the dining hall,

323
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,660
Mr. Kiyama didn't go back to his room

324
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,360
but went to the main house and killed Mr. Majima.

325
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,660
As Ayaka was still in the dining hall,

326
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,660
he didn't have to worry about being observed.

327
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,860
After he put the dead body in the rock garden,

328
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,460
Mr. Kiyama patiently waited for

329
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,460
Mr. Endo to close the curtains in the staff room where Ayaka was.

330
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:41,360
That is, Mr. Endo tried to hide Mr. Majima from view

331
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,360
but, in fact, in doing so, he helped Mr. Kiyama

332
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,460
carry out the crime.

333
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,160
I see.

334
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,060
Then the mattress...

335
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,960
Yes. We've found in Mr. Kiyama's room.

336
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,560
Wait a minute.

337
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,160
This is a setup.

338
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,660
And the criminal put the air mattress in my room

339
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,060
in order to put the blame on me.

340
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:02,460
Are you sure it doesn't look familiar?

341
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,760
Of course not.

342
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,860
I've never see an air mattress like this.

343
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:09,260
It sounds odd to me.

344
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:14,660
Mr. Kiyama, could you take a closer look at the mattress again?

345
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,660
This...

346
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:29,960
Yeah. This is the ink of your father's keepsake fountain pen

347
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,660
that you always carry on you.

348
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,360
I didn't expect that the ink splattered even over the mattress.

349
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,860
I thought I wiped off all the ink.

350
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,660
But how come...

351
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,160
Majima would've been killed anyway by Mr. Endo

352
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,760
even if you didn't do it.

353
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,060
I just happened to overheard

354
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:08,860
the guy proudly telling his story in a very amusing way.

355
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,360
Majima rigged the brakes

356
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,560
and made my father fall to his death.

357
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,760
While I was away, took the seat as president

358
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,860
and took over my father's corporation.

359
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:26,060
When I found out about it, I swore.

360
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:30,460
I was gonna kill that jerk someday.

361
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:36,560
So, Mr. Endo provided a wonderful opportunity for me to kill him.

362
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,760
You know, it created a perfect opportunity to offer

363
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,160
the dead body as a sacrifice

364
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,660
to the rock garden my father loved.

365
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,760
Oh, out of gas again.

366
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,760
Dad, I've heard enough about your 'Oh, out of gas'.

367
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,460
What're we gonna to do now, on a mountain path like this?

368
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,360
Hey, easy does it!

369
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,960
Perhaps a president may happen to pass us again

370
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,560
and invite us to his office.

371
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,460
I have a feeling that I'm gonna be able to drink tonight again.

372
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,760
You never learn.

373
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,660
Next Conan's Hint:

374
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,880
"Chinese table"

375
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,800
A really surprising guest will appear in the next episode.

376
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,140
Private Eye?

377
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
Isn't he dad's business rival?
