1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,670
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,470
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,970
Officer Takagi made a mistake.

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,970
The Youth Detective Squad to the rescue.

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,570
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,670
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,170
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,760
Hey, everyone! Something has happened!

9
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,060
What? Officer Takagi?

10
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,760
Where is he now?

11
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,060
He's over there in that park.

12
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,960
Yes, really he's trying desperately to find something.

13
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,960
Is he finding evidence of a case?

14
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,760
No, he isn't, because he isn't wearing gloves.

15
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,860
I got it. I've got what he's looking for.

16
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,560
-What? -What?

17
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,160
That should be here somewhere.

18
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,160
It cannot be anywhere but here.

19
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,560
It's you...

20
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,660
We're ready to help you.

21
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,260
Well, you'd do the same for us if we were in trouble.

22
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,960
I know, I know.

23
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,260
You lost something like this, right?

24
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,460
How do you know about it?

25
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,660
Don't you know we're the Youth Detective Squad?

26
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,360
I can see everything you are doing.

27
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,860
If you don't find it,

28
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,060
you're in big trouble, aren't you?

29
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,860
Of course I am.

30
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,560
It comes second only to a police life. It is very important.

31
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,460
What you lost is...

32
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,460
Maybe not your purse, but...

33
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,260
You lost your police notebook?

34
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,460
Don't speak so loud.

35
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,460
This is no good at all.

36
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,460
"The Policeman's Missing Notebook Case"

37
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,660
This morning I realized that I had lost my notebook.

38
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,760
And I looked through my room but couldn't find it.

39
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,060
Are you sure you were carrying it on your duty yesterday?

40
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,360
Yes, I'm sure.

41
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,860
And then, on the way home,

42
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,760
I happened to pass in front of this park.

43
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,760
Shut your mouth! You, liar!

44
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,260
Hey, cut it out!

45
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,260
What're you doing?

46
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,360
Cheat. I ought to blow you away here and now.

47
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,360
-Help. I'm choking. -Hey, hey! Hold on, you guys!

48
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,660
Break it up, you two.

49
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,360
Step off! Don't mess with me!

50
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,560
I'm a police officer

51
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,060
and am telling you to stop fighting right now!

52
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,260
I must have lost it then.

53
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,860
So, you're looking for it around here.

54
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,460
Do you think that maybe one of them picked up the notebook?

55
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,660
That's right.

56
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,160
I think that's very likely.

57
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,560
So, do you remember those two men's names?

58
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,660
Or what about their addresses?

59
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,760
Wait, calm down.

60
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,560
Why can't you believe me, Hanzaki?

61
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,460
Hanzaki.

62
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,860
The younger one's name was Hanzaki.

63
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,260
Anything else you remember about them?

64
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,960
How can I believe you?

65
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,060
I'm going to tell you, my manager, that I'm still a struggling singer

66
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,160
because all those jobs that you got were always crap for me!

67
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,160
The truth is that you have to pay your dues

68
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,560
in Enka (Japanese Ballad) business. You know that!

69
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,760
Have a little more patience, please.

70
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,660
How many times are you going to say that?

71
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,460
I know you've deceived me for a long time.

72
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,360
Give me back my time up to now

73
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,360
and the money you owe me, you punk!

74
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,960
Hey, hey! Hold on, you guys!

75
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,960
So, he's a struggling singer.

76
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,960
Don't you remember what kind of shoes they were wearing?

77
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,260
That reminds me...

78
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,160
The man named Hanzaki was wearing sandals.

79
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,660
I see.

80
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,960
Perhaps he lives nearby.

81
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,460
Yeah. Okay, then.

82
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,460
Let's look for him together.

83
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,260
But what if that man hasn't picked it up?

84
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,460
Why don't we divide into teams of two?

85
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,960
One is to go find the man named Hanzaki,

86
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,360
and the other is to look for the notebook in this park.

87
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,860
Alright!

88
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,060
Four One-Two-Three. Go.

89
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,260
Sorry to leave you here. Hang on, see you.

90
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,460
No good, there is no name of that person.

91
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,160
What about asking the record companies?

92
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,860
I'm afraid that's impossible.

93
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,960
There're an awful lot of big and small record companies.

94
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,160
Okay, then we've got to go around asking one by one.

95
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,260
Excuse me, but do you know the man named Hanzaki?

96
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,960
He is a singer and supposed to live around here somewhere.

97
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,260
Pardon me, sir.

98
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,260
The police handbook.

99
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,660
Yeah. That's right.

100
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,760
I wonder what if he can't find it.

101
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,060
Perhaps he is in a pathetic state.

102
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,960
Idiot!

103
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,460
You lost your police notebook, which is supposed to be

104
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,360
an extension of a police officer's soul and mind?

105
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,560
Get out! You're fired!

106
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,760
Officer Takagi... What a real pity.

107
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,760
Hey, you!

108
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,060
This is not the time for a snack. Help me, you two.

109
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,060
Sorry.

110
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,060
They came back.

111
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,760
Hey, how did it go? Did you find the man?

112
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,860
No, we didn't.

113
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,160
We can't find him by name and looks.

114
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,260
We can't find it either.

115
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,960
Hey, Officer?

116
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,260
"Jiro Hanzaki (30), Enka Singer" -What're you doing here?

117
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,360
You are here!

118
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,860
You, yesterday...

119
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,260
I'm sorry for the trouble last night.

120
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,960
So is this the man everyone is talking about?

121
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,760
-Mr. Hanzaki! -Mr. Hanzaki!

122
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,860
Why now?

123
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,260
I just wish you had walked by earlier than you actually did.

124
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,160
Mr. Hanzaki, did you pick up anything last night?

125
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,960
My stuff... like this.

126
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,160
No, I didn't.

127
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,960
Perhaps neither did the manager, I think.

128
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,160
Okay, you didn't.

129
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
You lost your thing like this, right?

130
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,360
I am going to find it with you.

131
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,960
Thanks but you don't have to do that.

132
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,560
Just want to repay you for your kindness.

133
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,360
Last night, thanks to you,

134
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,560
the manager and I could get back together soon.

135
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,560
So, today, we were supposed to have a lunch meeting together, but...

136
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,260
I was waiting for him at my apartment, but he didn't come.

137
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:27,060
I guess he is getting drunk at his house, by now. He always boozes.

138
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,560
You know. That's the trouble.

139
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,860
I called him several times but the manager didn't pick up the phone.

140
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,160
That means he is now falling down drunk at his house.

141
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,260
I assure you.

142
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,360
If you think he doesn't show up no matter how long you wait,

143
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,160
then why don't you go to his house yourself?

144
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,460
Because it takes one and a half hour

145
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,260
to get to the manager's house even if I drive at top speed.

146
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,060
I think that's a bother.

147
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,760
Something is attached to you.

148
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,260
It's a shampoo.

149
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,160
A little while ago when I cleaned my bathroom,

150
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,960
I accidentally stepped on the shampoo bottle.

151
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,460
By the way, do you have the time, Officer?

152
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,460
1:00 pm. It's just 1:00 pm.

153
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,760
It's already 1:00 pm?

154
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,460
We'd better hurry and find it.

155
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,260
All right already. You don't have to help me anymore.

156
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,460
But...

157
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,460
So then, let me buy your lunch, please?

158
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,460
Just 2,000 yen and all you can eat for two hours!

159
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,460
Come on, come on.

160
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,060
No thanks, I'll pass on that one.

161
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:41,160
I understand but you don't have to be so modest.

162
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,360
All right, I'll eat as much as I can for two hours!

163
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,160
See you, Officer.

164
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,760
-What a strange man. -He's too weird.

165
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,160
If they hadn't picked it up,

166
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,960
then it must be still here somewhere.

167
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,060
That man, Hanzaki... I suspect he's up to something,

168
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,260
Yeah.

169
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,260
I wonder why he bothered to ask what time it was.

170
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:09,660
Yeah, it's hard to think that someone in this neighborhood

171
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,360
doesn't know that clock.

172
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,960
Yet, he bothered to ask Officer Takagi, what time was it?

173
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,760
What for?

174
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,860
I got it.

175
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,460
Have you found it?

176
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,160
No, not yet. I mean... it isn't about the notebook.

177
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,860
-All right. -Then what did you get?

178
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,260
Everyone, gather around.

179
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,860
What? That man named Hanzaki killed the manager?

180
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,860
Mitsuhiko, are you sure?

181
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,260
I'm 100 percent sure about it. And also he killed him just now.

182
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,260
Hanzaki seemed to think that he's still a struggling singer

183
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,360
because of the manager and to hold a grudge against him for it.

184
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,160
So far as I know now, he has a motive.

185
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,260
But...

186
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,260
The droplet of shampoo clung the bottom of his trousers, right?

187
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,460
Yeah, he said, he accidentally stepped on the shampoo bottle

188
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,060
while cleaning his bathroom.

189
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,560
First of all, I wondered why he lied about it.

190
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,760
Did he lie?

191
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,760
It goes without saying that you should roll up your pants

192
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,060
so as not to get it wet while cleaning your bathroom.

193
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,660
And if he rolled up his pants,

194
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,060
the shampoo shouldn't stick to the bottom of it.

195
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,960
That is, he was not cleaning his bathroom,

196
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,460
but he was in the bathroom for another purpose.

197
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,660
Wait a second, Mitsuhiko.

198
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,460
And then?

199
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,460
This morning, Mr. Hanzaki called the manager to come to his apartment,

200
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,860
saying that he wanted to make up with him.

201
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,260
That's enough.

202
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,160
I can't drink that much.

203
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,760
He skilfully encouraged the manager, a heavy drinker to drink Sake.

204
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,860
After waiting for the time to be right, at just before 1:00 pm.

205
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,460
He carried him to his apartment's bathroom

206
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,360
and had him drown in the bathtub.

207
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,060
Then he accidentally stepped on the shampoo bottle.

208
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,860
And he dashed out of the apartment then came to the park,

209
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,760
to set up his alibi.

210
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,960
To set up his alibi?

211
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,160
Yeah.

212
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,860
He's going to carry the body

213
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,560
out of his apartment in secret, perhaps tonight

214
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,160
and sink the body in the bathtub of the manager's house.

215
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,560
In doing this, the police will treat it

216
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,660
as an accidental death

217
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,960
and even if they treat the case as a homicide,

218
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,860
his estimated time of death

219
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,260
was around one this afternoon.

220
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,860
Yes.

221
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,960
By the way, do you have the time, Officer?

222
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,760
1:00 pm. It's just 1:00 pm.

223
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,960
At the time when the manager was supposed to be killed at home,

224
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,360
Hanzaki was here.

225
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,860
As the real police officer, Officer Takagi proves his alibi,

226
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,460
nobody doubts Mr. Hanzaki.

227
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,460
That's the perfect crime.

228
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,060
Well done, Mitsuhiko. Perfect reasoning.

229
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,060
I think it's far from perfect.

230
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,560
Officer Takagi... What a pity.

231
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,660
He lost his police notebook

232
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,860
and he was even used to set up the murderer's alibi.

233
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,660
Mitsuhiko, Did you say,

234
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,160
"Everybody knows that he or she should roll up their pants

235
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,260
when cleaning the bathroom."

236
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,360
That's just a matter of common sense all over the world.

237
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,860
Mr. Kogoro doesn't pull up his pants because he thinks it's a bother.

238
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,060
It's a...

239
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,160
Incidentally Dr. Agasa also doesn't.

240
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,160
That means there was a possibility

241
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,660
that he was really cleaning his bathroom.

242
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,360
And Officer Takagi came here

243
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,460
to search for his police notebook

244
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,160
because he happened to lose it.

245
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,060
It's very difficult to suppose that Mr. Hanzaki relied on such a chance

246
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,960
to establish his important alibi. What do you think, Mitsuhiko?

247
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,460
It's...

248
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,660
Your guess was far off the mark.

249
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,960
I won't take it.

250
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,260
Ayumi.

251
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,760
Cut it out, Ayumi.

252
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
Because, I can never forgive that man.

253
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,160
That man tried to use such a nice guy, Officer Takagi.

254
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,260
But, my reasoning was wrong, so...

255
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,160
What does that mean anyway?

256
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,260
What is what?

257
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,860
Look at that.

258
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,360
How strange...

259
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,460
He isn't eating anything yet.

260
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,160
Yeah, it's true.

261
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,060
Why?

262
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:36,060
That man... Is he still up to anything?

263
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,710
He's still not eating anything.

264
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,010
That's a waste.

265
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,510
But he cares only about what time it is.

266
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,610
Yeah.

267
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,410
He's only watching the clock.

268
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,710
How strange.

269
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,910
If he didn't get hungry,

270
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,810
why did he enter the All-you-can-eat-restaurant for two hours, at all?

271
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,410
Yeah, that's right.

272
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,410
How come?

273
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,510
I remember he said...

274
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:09,310
I am going to find that square thing with you.

275
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:12,410
So then, let me buy your lunch at that restaurant, please?

276
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,710
He relentlessly tried to be with him.

277
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,510
So that explains it.

278
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,210
Mitsuhiko, your reasoning isn't entirely true but half true.

279
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,610
What do you mean "half true"?

280
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:29,610
As you suspected, that guy is trying to kill the manager.

281
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,910
So, he entered this restaurant and is now passing himself off

282
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,310
as a customer in order to establish his alibi.

283
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,710
To establish his alibi?

284
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,310
If Officer Takagi hadn't sent him away,

285
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:42,010
he would have wanted to establish an alibi

286
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,410
by continuing to find the police notebook.

287
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,110
But you said Officer Takagi happened to come to the park today.

288
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:52,110
No. He knew Officer Takagi would be sure to come to find it,

289
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,910
perhaps because he picked it up last night.

290
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:58,110
You mean that man still has the notebook?

291
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:01,910
No. Unfortunately I'm afraid he's already thrown it out.

292
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:06,710
Yeah. There's no reason to keep such a dangerous thing around.

293
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,210
I see.

294
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,810
I said Mituhiko's reasoning was half correct.

295
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:14,010
What was wrong is the manager's death time.

296
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,210
The time isn't 1:00 pm, but even later,

297
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,910
around from two to two thirty or so.

298
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,510
But, it's just past 1:00 pm.

299
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:25,610
Yeah. The plot to kill the manager is now going on steadily.

300
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,410
Perhaps in the bathroom of his apartment.

301
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,810
That's why he cares about the time like that.

302
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:51,010
Anyway, it may not be too late now to save the manager's life.

303
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,410
-Yes! -But, wait, do you know

304
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,810
where is that guy's apartment?

305
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,210
Oh, no.

306
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,710
He'll never tell us if we ask.

307
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,110
Let's split up and find it.

308
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,310
-Yeah! -Yeah!

309
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:11,310
Even the Youth Detective Squad gave up on me.

310
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,610
Oh, man..

311
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,910
That struggling singer.

312
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,310
He's quite a character.

313
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,610
Last night, he was picking up concrete blocks there.

314
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,910
Whatever, but that's not what we want to know.

315
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:38,110
Instead, where does he live?

316
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,310
Well, I have no idea.

317
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,010
Hanzaki. His name is Hanzaki.

318
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,610
He's an Enka singer.

319
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,110
He must be living around here.

320
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,910
Like I care. I don't like Enka at all.

321
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,410
-See you. -Hey! Wait!

322
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,310
Let's go over there.

323
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,310
Yes.

324
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:03,010
Hello, hello? Do you copy? We've got his address.

325
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,410
-Really? -Good!

326
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:09,710
The second floor of the Park Side Height, third room. Over.

327
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,910
Roger. We'll be there soon.

328
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,210
I'm going to get Officer Takagi.

329
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,310
Good idea.

330
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,210
Hopefully, if he can prevent the murder,

331
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,010
it'll help to offset the blunder of losing his police notebook.

332
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,510
Yeah.

333
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,810
The shop owner said that Hanzaki bought a big block of ice

334
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,310
at the store today.

335
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:31,310
And concrete blocks he picked up.

336
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,910
I got it. I saw through his trick.

337
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:52,410
And only if Hanzaki leaves the body laying on the stairs,

338
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,610
he can make it look like the manager himself

339
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,410
loses his footing and dies in his drunken state.

340
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,610
Good Heavens! We must hurry!

341
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,310
What? Murder case?

342
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,310
Not yet, but...

343
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,710
if you ask me, I mean... he's going to be killed soon.

344
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,110
I don't get what you're saying.

345
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,310
Sorry, but I have to find my notebook.

346
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,910
-But... -Leave it to me!

347
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,110
Hey, the man named Hanzaki

348
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:19,110
actually picked up your notebook yesterday.

349
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,110
Did he actually pick it up?

350
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,310
And he said, "I keep it in my apartment,

351
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,210
so please come to pick it up."

352
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,210
Where? His apartment!

353
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,110
Conan!

354
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:32,610
I managed to get a master key from the landlord!

355
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,510
Hey!

356
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,310
Conan!

357
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,510
-Is this his room? -Yeah.

358
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,610
Where? Where?

359
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,910
Where? Where? Where?

360
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,810
Where is my notebook?

361
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,810
-Way to go! -Way to go!

362
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,110
Now I'm going to untie you.

363
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,110
Thank you for your help.

364
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,110
It's you, yesterday?

365
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,110
"Seiichi Sugiyama (52), Hanzaki's manager" -Yes. My name is Sugiyama.

366
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:23,010
You helped me both yesterday and today.

367
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,110
Thank you, Mr. Takagi.

368
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,010
How do you know my name?

369
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,110
I don't think I told you yesterday.

370
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:33,110
I saw your name on your notebook.

371
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,310
Yes, this is it. I've found it.

372
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,910
You did it. You found it at last.

373
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,110
It would seem that that Hanzaki guy

374
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,810
didn't pick up the notebook himself,

375
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,210
but just saw him pick it up.

376
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:49,110
Yes. So it seemed.

377
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,810
What a relief it is.

378
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,110
Why are you here?

379
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,810
That's what I want to know about Hanzaki.

380
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:10,010
I've gone along with you a long time

381
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,410
because I believed you had a special talent.

382
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,110
Why didn't you believe in me until the end?

383
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,310
Hanzaki!

384
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,110
I'm sorry.

385
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,810
I'm Takagi, an officer of the Criminal Investigations Division 1

386
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,810
of the Metropolitan Police.

387
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:28,710
Mr. Hanzaki. Please follow me to the police station.

388
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,810
Yes.

389
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,010
Mr. Takagi.

390
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,210
I heard you prevented a murder.

391
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,810
Yes, sir.

392
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:12,110
Well done.

393
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,510
You did a great job and appreciate your hard work.

394
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,510
Yes, sir.

395
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:18,610
By the way, how are you feeling now? Is your headache gone?

396
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,410
Did you run a high fever of 39 degrees? What is your temperature now?

397
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,110
Did you have a stomach ache then?

398
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,410
Did you stumble and sprain an ankle?

399
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,510
And you couldn't move because of your nausea, could you?

400
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:35,710
Officer Takagi pretended to be sick in order to find his lost notebook.

401
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,910
-Looks like it. -He played hooky from work.

402
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,310
You idiot!

403
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:43,010
Shame on you as a police person for pretending to be sick.

404
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,110
Go to your police station, now!

405
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,210
Yes, sir!

406
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,610
Double Time!

407
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,210
Yes.

408
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:54,210
Please wait, Inspector Megure!

409
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:00,210
After all, he ended up being scolded by him.

410
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,400
Next Conan's Hint:

411
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,380
"Curtain"

412
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,940
Their identity in the next episode is...

413
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:12,020
I'm Jodie. Detective from the west, who is that?
