1
00:00:02,539 --> 00:00:03,839
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:05,739
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:07,039
Awesome stuntman!

4
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:10,339
There is a glimpse of a sad incident behind the glamorous scenes.

5
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:11,839
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:13,539
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:15,939
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,940
Masked Yaiba!

9
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,640
You shall not get away!

10
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,040
Darn it.

11
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,040
Curses!

12
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,440
I won't let him run away!

13
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,840
Yaiba?

14
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,440
Darn it!

15
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,140
What?

16
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,940
"Extreme Car Stunt"

17
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,240
Absolutely! Absolutely no way!

18
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,340
I can't adopt such a plan!

19
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,140
Too dangerous.

20
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,640
-I think so, too. -Who's talking to you?

21
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,040
Keep quiet, kid.

22
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,840
Sure, it's dangerous. Dangerous for other stuntmen.

23
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,840
But I can do it.

24
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,940
I've experienced a stunt like this many times before.

25
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,640
Right, Mr. Kijima?

26
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,540
"Daisaku Kijima (40), Cameraman" -Yeah, I guess so.

27
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,840
But...

28
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,240
Let's do it without a cut, Mr. Kijima.

29
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,940
No cheating.

30
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,240
Only one cut till I run in here and fall, please.

31
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,140
Besides, your figure of coming out of the car

32
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,340
won't be filmed from below. But...

33
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,740
Mr. Rikiishi, you are already...

34
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,340
To think that we get to see Yaiba on location. Gorgeous, isn't it?

35
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,740
Just as expected of you, Dr. Agasa!

36
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,740
He's really a big face!

37
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,540
You mean his face is widely known.

38
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,540
Look!

39
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,140
They gave me a bunch of Masked Yaiba's seals!

40
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,240
And I don't have most of them.

41
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,440
Really?

42
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,840
What did you say? What do you mean by "already"?

43
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,040
Be frank with me.

44
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
What? What's going on?

45
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,240
-Looks like they're in trouble. -An argument?

46
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,240
As I said, we can now make impressive films freely

47
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,040
using digital technology, more impressive than real stunts.

48
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,940
-That's why I said so. -Are you saying that

49
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,740
you don't need antiquated stuntmen like me?

50
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,840
No, I am not saying that.

51
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,640
A car driven by Masked Yaiba is coming up to the roof.

52
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,640
The Masked Yaiba car stops.

53
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,840
Suppose that his car is A,

54
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,540
and the other car is operated with a remote controller.

55
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,840
Let's call it B.

56
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,640
Replacing Car A driven by Joker, Car B speeds towards the fence.

57
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,840
Because the camera is shooting from below, this replacement can't be seen.

58
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,140
And digital enhancements will be added to it later.

59
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,540
This kind of stunt will be enough for this scene.

60
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,940
Darn it.

61
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,440
The steering wheel is OK, the brakes are OK.

62
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,640
So, that's the story.

63
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,240
Get it over with quickly.

64
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,740
I've gotta make preparations.

65
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,440
Hey, Kijima, you're finished,

66
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,240
being at the beck and call of this green-horn.

67
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,040
-What? -Please stop it!

68
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,840
This plan is final.

69
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,840
I've got the producer's OK, too.

70
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,540
I will go by this!

71
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,140
Thank you very much for understanding!

72
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,140
Are you sure?

73
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,340
You're going to regret it.

74
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,540
Let go of me!

75
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,540
You know, with the swooshes!

76
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,140
Yeah, the part with all the flashes!

77
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,440
I love that part.

78
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,340
Well, after lunch, I will move to the next cut.

79
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,140
Get everything ready and stand by, please!

80
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,840
What a grouch.

81
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,040
Masked Yaiba will beat him anyway. Right?

82
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,740
It serves him right.

83
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,640
Hey...

84
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,740
This is just a drama, isn't it?

85
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,140
Heck! I feel awfully unhappy.

86
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,140
We've come all the way here and no shooting?

87
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,440
It's lunch time now, so it can't helped, Genta!

88
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,240
Let's have lunch, too.

89
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,640
If you say so...

90
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,440
Is there anyone who hasn't received box lunch yet?

91
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,740
My stomach's growling.

92
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,240
Come off it, Genta

93
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,340
Your stomach reacts quickly.

94
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,640
Here we go!

95
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,940
"Masked Yaiba to Ayumi"

96
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,740
Are you sure my autograph is what you want?

97
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,640
Yes. Thank you very much!

98
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,340
Where did Genta and Mitsuhiko go?

99
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,140
Splendid! Even the number is the same!

100
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,440
These two cars will be exchanged on the roof of the building,

101
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,540
and the remote-controlled one will fall over.

102
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,440
I'm excited!

103
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,840
OK! This is in commemoration of having come here.

104
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,940
Oh, no! Genta!

105
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,640
Just what do you think you're doing?

106
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,240
What's going on, kids?

107
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,940
Nothing at all.

108
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,440
-Nothing! -No!

109
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,540
Excuse us.

110
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,040
Huh?

111
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,240
I'm counting on you.

112
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,440
Got a sec?

113
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,240
You gotta be kidding!

114
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,340
I can't believe you're still meddling!

115
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,940
-I'm not meddling! -Those two are arguing again.

116
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,640
I hope they will start shooting the film without a trouble.

117
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,740
I am worried a bit.

118
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,440
Mr. Rikiishi!

119
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,440
Huh, did it start?

120
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,140
Please somebody, stop him!

121
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,940
He is going to display the plan he was talking about some time ago!

122
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,240
Mr. Rikiishi!

123
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,840
It... it can't be!

124
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,340
That's why...

125
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,040
That's why, I told him not to!

126
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,640
Whatever is the matter? What happened?

127
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,840
The seat belt is almost unfastened.

128
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,440
This means...

129
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,640
Just before he broke through that fence on the roof,

130
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,340
he failed to get out of the car.

131
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,440
I guess that's how this case will be settled, an accident.

132
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,140
What's on your mind?

133
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,340
Maybe... this is...

134
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,340
Excuse me, Mr. Cameraman!

135
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,040
You were shooting a few minutes ago, weren't you?

136
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,040
Could you show it to me?

137
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,440
Just as I thought!

138
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,240
Oops!

139
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,340
I must check over there too!

140
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,240
Conan!

141
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,740
Where are you going?

142
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,840
He's going to outdo us again!

143
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,040
-Let's go too! -Okay!

144
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,340
Hey, you all!

145
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,740
This is...

146
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,340
What's up, Conan?

147
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,240
This is not an accident!

148
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,640
This is skillfully and carefully schemed murder.

149
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,740
What did you say?

150
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:35,967
The person who has died is Mr. Kengo Rikiishi, a stuntman, 38 years old.

151
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,367
Was the cause of death found to be from the fall?

152
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:41,467
Yes. When the car crashed to the ground,

153
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:44,067
the impact of the fall run through his entire body.

154
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:45,467
He died on the spot.

155
00:12:45,467 --> 00:12:47,967
But to think that they would make a car fall over

156
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,867
from that height with a person inside,

157
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:52,267
that's quite a dangerous way to film something.

158
00:12:52,267 --> 00:12:53,567
Wrong!

159
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:56,067
We would never let anyone do such a stunt.

160
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,267
What do you mean?

161
00:12:58,267 --> 00:13:01,367
Well, he... Mr. Rikiishi did it of his own discretion!

162
00:13:01,367 --> 00:13:04,867
He did a stunt he wanted to show and failed.

163
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,267
Exactly speaking, it was not a stunt.

164
00:13:07,267 --> 00:13:09,767
It was a performance before the take.

165
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:13,467
I don't understand why did Mr. Rikiishi do such a thing.

166
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:14,867
He was driven to do so.

167
00:13:14,867 --> 00:13:17,167
-Driven to do so? -Why?

168
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:19,067
I can understand him, too.

169
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:21,467
Young people are appearing one after another.

170
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,667
If I had stuck to filming only,

171
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:25,767
I would have starved to death a long time ago myself.

172
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:28,567
I am not saying we don't need a stuntman.

173
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:31,167
We absolutely need stuntmen for this kind of filming.

174
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:33,667
But, thanks to the development of digital technology,

175
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:36,567
stunts like those done in the past are no longer necessary.

176
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:40,767
But, it is also a fact that there are those who got fired because of this.

177
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:42,467
I can't do anything about it.

178
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:44,067
The staff producer's in charge of personnel.

179
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:47,167
The staff producer wanted to fire him,

180
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:50,267
but I heard that you stopped him.

181
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:52,667
Are you sure?

182
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:55,067
-You're going to regret it. -Let go of me!

183
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,667
I guess he was struggling

184
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,367
to keep the position you helped him from losing,

185
00:13:58,367 --> 00:14:00,467
though it was held together only by a thin strip.

186
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:02,267
That must have been it.

187
00:14:02,267 --> 00:14:05,467
You sound you understand, Mr. Kijima.

188
00:14:05,467 --> 00:14:07,467
But, aren't you the one who attempted a direct appeal to the director,

189
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:09,867
and made it hard for him to keep his job in the first place?

190
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:14,067
Kengo seemed to know what you did behind the scene.

191
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:18,367
You gotta be kidding! Are you saying I did something to him?

192
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,667
You are the one got beaten by him,

193
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:23,067
because he nailed you for negligent maintenance, aren't you?

194
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:26,867
Come off it. No arguing here, please.

195
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:30,667
You often got beaten by him too, didn't you?

196
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:34,467
You would often scream "I'll kill him" at drinking parties.

197
00:14:34,467 --> 00:14:37,467
What? Are you saying I did something more than that?

198
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:40,667
Officer, this is enough. Please make it clear.

199
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:42,267
This was an accident, wasn't it? This thing.

200
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:43,667
Well, let me see.

201
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:46,567
We'll have to get specialists to investigate and tell us

202
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:49,167
whether this was caused by negligence in maintenance or not.

203
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:51,367
Absolutely not!

204
00:14:51,367 --> 00:14:52,967
The maintenance was complete.

205
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:54,267
But you have a motive.

206
00:14:54,267 --> 00:14:56,167
The same goes for you too!

207
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:58,367
But at this stage,

208
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:01,567
the possibility of this being an accident is high, I would say.

209
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,067
See? Naturally!

210
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:05,667
Doc, you're on.

211
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:10,267
Wait!

212
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:13,067
Well...

213
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:18,367
This is a murder case, under the pretense of an accident.

214
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:20,567
What? What did you say?

215
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:23,767
What proof do you have for saying that?

216
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:26,967
Calm down. I want to confirm one thing.

217
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,367
About the late Mr. Rikiishi's personality.

218
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:31,867
Personality?

219
00:15:31,867 --> 00:15:34,467
For example, the more dangerous a stunt becomes,

220
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,767
the more he wants to do it.

221
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:39,167
Yeah, right,

222
00:15:39,167 --> 00:15:42,767
he had a tendency since his young days to go out of his way

223
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:44,167
to plunged into danger.

224
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:46,167
It's an occupational sickness.

225
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:48,967
Before doing so, careful preparation and training

226
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:50,467
are naturally needed, though.

227
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:53,067
A person who can do this is first-class.

228
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:55,367
How was Mr. Rikiishi?

229
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:56,867
He was first-class.

230
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:59,667
Yes, when he was young.

231
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:03,567
But, recently he perhaps became careless.

232
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:06,767
Say the murderer took advantage of this?

233
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:09,067
-What? -Just what do you mean?

234
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:10,867
Mr. Fukamachi.

235
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:14,567
What were you talking about with Mr. Rikiishi then?

236
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:18,267
He was saying he would show us a real stunt.

237
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:20,867
He wouldn't listen to me and...

238
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:24,967
It's the other way around!

239
00:16:24,967 --> 00:16:25,967
The other way around?

240
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:31,567
What I am saying is, he was not the one who proposed it, you did.

241
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:33,467
By saying something like,

242
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:36,767
"Depending on your performance, they may agree to it,"

243
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:39,067
"though I would oppose to it in my position,"

244
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:41,367
and tempted him to do it.

245
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,067
Nonsense!

246
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:46,367
Are you saying that I killed him?

247
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:50,967
Yes, the murderer was you, Mr. Fukamachi.

248
00:16:50,967 --> 00:16:52,467
Doctor Agasa.

249
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:54,967
He might have attempted to provoke Mr. Rikiishi,

250
00:16:54,967 --> 00:16:56,767
but the one who actually drove the car

251
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:59,467
and failed the stunt was Mr. Rikiishi himself.

252
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:01,467
This is not a murder case!

253
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:08,567
You are right. For that reason, you furthermore said to Mr. Rikiishi.

254
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:12,667
"No explosives are loaded in Car A for it to explode in mid air."

255
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:15,767
"So, sitting in Car A to do your stunt is meaningless."

256
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:17,867
"Don't do it."

257
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:21,367
After being told so, Mr. Rikiishi made up his mind

258
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:23,767
to quickly change to Car B, which is loaded with explosives

259
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:26,267
as soon as he arrives at the roof

260
00:17:26,267 --> 00:17:28,567
and flee from the car just before it falls over.

261
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:30,167
He wanted to do a dangerous stunt

262
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:33,367
and show everyone how capable he is.

263
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:38,167
What? You mean that's Car B that was on the roof?

264
00:17:40,467 --> 00:17:41,867
No,

265
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:45,767
this is Car A that had no explosives loaded in it!

266
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:47,867
I'm confused.

267
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,267
Me, too.

268
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:51,367
Wait a second.

269
00:17:51,367 --> 00:17:52,967
I am sure that back then...

270
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:56,167
Officer Takagi, just in case, check the car on the roof.

271
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:57,167
Yes, sir!

272
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:02,667
Inspector! I've found it!

273
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:04,767
This is Car B, as we thought!

274
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:08,667
In other words, Mr. Rikiishi dared the stunt without changing cars.

275
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:12,967
He failed and fell over.

276
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,467
It was surely an accident.

277
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:17,167
Don't jump to conclusions.

278
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:21,167
Try recalling Mr. Rikiishi, right after the accident.

279
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:24,867
If you have any pictures of the site taken by the forensic officer...

280
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:31,767
-Conan! -Yes.

281
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:34,467
-This is it after all! -This!

282
00:18:34,467 --> 00:18:37,267
The Masked Yaiba sticker that Genta put on the car.

283
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:41,367
He stuck them on the car that the man in charge moved to the roof.

284
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:43,067
Right, Genta?

285
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:44,667
Yeah.

286
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:46,267
No doubt about it.

287
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:49,067
He did change the cars on the roof!

288
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:51,367
Sorry.

289
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:54,067
I put the stickers on both cars.

290
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,767
No.

291
00:18:56,767 --> 00:19:00,767
We therefore, can't prove that he changed cars.

292
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:04,267
No, it's not that. Here's what I want you to see!

293
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:08,167
Hey, Mr. Cameraman.

294
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:10,767
Could you show us the film you showed me some time ago again?

295
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,867
Stop, please!

296
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:17,267
See? His cape's not jammed.

297
00:19:17,267 --> 00:19:18,867
What's this?

298
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:21,267
It doesn't look as if he opened or closed the door

299
00:19:21,267 --> 00:19:22,667
until he got to the roof.

300
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:24,867
But, the explosive...

301
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:27,867
All that had to be done was to reload the car beforehand.

302
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:31,267
But it doesn't prove that he changed cars.

303
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:32,667
Conan!

304
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:36,067
I went up to the roof right away,

305
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:38,367
but, the hood was still hot.

306
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,867
It seemed as if the engine had just been stopped.

307
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:42,767
Oh, as you say...

308
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:46,067
Nonsense! So what?

309
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:48,067
Supposing... just supposing that

310
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:52,567
I had lured him to change cars on the roof,

311
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:56,667
I hate to say this but, he's the one who couldn't make it out of the car

312
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,467
before the car fell over, right?

313
00:19:58,467 --> 00:20:00,667
Are you saying that his ability is no good anymore?

314
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:04,267
He could've stepped on the brake before he broke through the fence.

315
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:06,467
He couldn't even do that, which means...

316
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:08,067
I agree.

317
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:13,667
No, both getting out of the car and stepping on the brakes

318
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:16,467
were impossible to begin with.

319
00:20:16,467 --> 00:20:18,767
I don't understand.

320
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:21,067
Please try to remember

321
00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:24,767
what kind of Car B that was prepared on the roof was like.

322
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:28,567
In addition to explosives for a mid air explosion being set up...

323
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:30,167
A remote controller!

324
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:32,167
Where is the remote controller now?

325
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:33,767
That's...

326
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:39,567
This is it, isn't it?

327
00:20:39,567 --> 00:20:43,567
Yes. He said he wanted to check it, so I lent it to him.

328
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:48,067
By using it, we can find out which car is A and which car is B.

329
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,167
What is this?

330
00:21:02,867 --> 00:21:05,367
It seems to be crying.

331
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:06,767
Yes, it does.

332
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,667
Poor thing.

333
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:14,067
I had debts, so I used the production money.

334
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:17,367
He found out about it and blackmailed me.

335
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:20,367
That's why you took advantage of Mr. Rikiishi's mental tendency

336
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:22,867
and planned the murder.

337
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:26,567
Car A driven by Rikiishi reached the roof parking lot.

338
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:29,167
You used the remote controller at just about the time

339
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,967
he was to transfer to Car B.

340
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:39,067
The brake didn't work and the door didn't open.

341
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:40,967
The car fell over.

342
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:49,567
And afterwards, Mr. Rikiishi's death would be deemed an accident

343
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:50,767
he caused himself.

344
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:54,067
So long as everyone thought that he died in Car A,

345
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:56,567
all he had to do is return the remote controller

346
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:59,367
and act as if nothing had happened.

347
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:02,167
Isn't that what you thought?

348
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:42,667
I can't eat anymore.

349
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:44,367
Masked Yaiba, you look great.

350
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:47,467
You can't stick the sticker all over on there, Genta.

351
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,867
My deduction's gone down the drain.

352
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:52,167
I agree with him.

353
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,840
Next Conan's Hint:

354
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,480
"Stir stick"

355
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,780
It's a stir stick but you shouldn't mix the case around.
