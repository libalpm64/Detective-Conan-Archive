1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,840
Just as flowing water has no form

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,740
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,740
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,740
Sonoko makes an appearance after a long absence today.

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,840
A man and crime at the skating rink.

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,140
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:02,390
"Dying Message Revives (Part 1)"

10
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,590
There they are!

11
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,190
More and more of them!

12
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,390
Loads and loads of good-looking men!

13
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,690
Take a look at all of them!

14
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,690
Look at all those choices of good-looking men.

15
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,890
We've got big catch.

16
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,090
Hey, Sonoko.

17
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:42,390
Sonoko! What about Mr. Kyogoku?

18
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,490
Well...

19
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,990
Makoto is more like a scarred

20
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,190
all over the place samurai than a prince.

21
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,590
Besides, he hasn't contacted me at all

22
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,790
after he's gone abroad too.

23
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,490
I've kind of lost my passion for him.

24
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,190
Come on, you will be beaten for speaking like this.

25
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,890
Mr. Kyogoku has a lot of girl fans.

26
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,090
Hey. Please don't put me in the same boat you're on.

27
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,190
-What? -You're the type who'll wait patiently forever

28
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,890
for your husband to return home, aren't you?

29
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,390
I'm not waiting for Shinichi!

30
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,190
Oh, my...

31
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,190
I never even said a word about Shinichi, did I?

32
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,290
Hey!

33
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,490
Besides, didn't you choose this rink

34
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,590
because it's a memorable place

35
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,590
that you two used to always come together to, right?

36
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,890
I have no good memories!

37
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,690
Shinichi looked down on me

38
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,090
because I had a hard time learning how to skate.

39
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:44,790
So, he taught you holding your hands, feet and hips, right?

40
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,690
What's with you today? Cut out teasing me, Sonoko.

41
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:55,590
So today it's your turn to teach him how to skate!

42
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,590
No, don't bother...

43
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,190
What? Can he skate?

44
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,690
I wonder because this is my first time skating with Conan.

45
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,090
Can you skate, Conan?

46
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,390
Oh, my God!

47
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,590
Maybe this is his first time?

48
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,190
Now is my chance to get back at this kid.

49
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,090
Cut it out, Sonoko.

50
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,090
This Sonoko...

51
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,190
Out of my way...

52
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,390
Move!

53
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,190
Out of my way...

54
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,490
No!

55
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,490
Out of my way...

56
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,790
Conan!

57
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,590
It hurts!

58
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,890
"Chizu Itami (27), Daughter of a Corporate Executive" -It hurts...

59
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,690
Hey, are you all right?

60
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,090
Are you all right?

61
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,290
It hurts! Help, Yasuharu!

62
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,590
"Yasuharu Misawa (29), Banker" -Gosh.

63
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,590
That's what you get for speeding despite being a beginner.

64
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,390
But...

65
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:09,390
You won't be able to attract men's attention by acting cute like that soon.

66
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,590
"Izumi Sano (28), Office Lady" -Chizu,

67
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,390
an active, curious rich young lady

68
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,290
is over the hill after 30 years of age, you know.

69
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,190
How rude! Why do you always say things like that?

70
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,290
You annoy me.

71
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,890
Okay...

72
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,090
"Yoriko Komatsu (30)" -It's been a long time

73
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,790
"Housewife" -since the Clay comrades met!

74
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,790
So let's not argue, okay?

75
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,790
Are you all Clay shooters?

76
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,090
What is that?

77
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,690
The game in which you throw a small plate

78
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,690
and shoot it down with a shotgun!

79
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,790
We just went this afternoon and finished a shooting!

80
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,790
A group is more fun than one after all.

81
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,990
We haven't seen each other since that accident six months ago.

82
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,090
The accident six months ago?

83
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,590
Right! Will you hear me out, kid?

84
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,590
It's a sort of stupid and scary story.

85
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,890
Don't tell him.

86
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,190
-What? -Are you crazy?

87
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,790
Why tell a kid something like that?

88
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,590
Besides, I thought I already told you that

89
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,190
"Kunitomo Orita (29)" -if you ever talk about him,

90
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,190
"Firefighter" -I'm leaving on the spot.

91
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,890
What a handsome guy.

92
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,490
He is as much a samurai as you can get.

93
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,490
Hey! Orita, are you really going to leave?

94
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,990
Aren't we going to drink up?

95
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,090
I'm just going to take a puff somewhere nearby

96
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:31,090
since some idiot made me recall something unpleasant.

97
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,090
What's with him? Just because he is a bit handsome,

98
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,390
he thinks he can talk like that to me!

99
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:39,290
But it's your fault for bringing that out.

100
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,590
It just slipped out!

101
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,390
And he has the nerve to call me stupid.

102
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,490
He is the one who is being rude, don't you think?

103
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,190
I hate that guy!

104
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,790
He is not cheerful and has a foul mouth.

105
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,190
He is always not part of the group, besides.

106
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,990
Not part of the group?

107
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,190
Hey, I've always been wondering about.

108
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,990
Isn't it about time you explain things?

109
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,990
What? You still don't know?

110
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,990
Well, I don't really understand either.

111
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,790
Same here. Why do you always say that?

112
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,890
What? No joke...

113
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,890
Are you serious? I don't believe it.

114
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,590
So, why don't you hurry up and tell us.

115
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,090
Talk about annoying!

116
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:25,290
No way! You're the last person I'm going to tell!

117
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,990
Since you guys are not curious young ladies,

118
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,190
I guess you'll never find out!

119
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,190
Where are you going?

120
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,590
To the toilet!

121
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,790
If you can't figure it out until the time I come back,

122
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,790
I'll drop you a hint.

123
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,290
She makes me so mad!

124
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:47,890
And? Curious lady of the Suzuki Financial Group,

125
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,290
do you happen to know what it's about?

126
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,890
Well...

127
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:55,690
Don't you think this place is getting crowded?

128
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,690
Probably because of the fireworks!

129
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,890
You mean the one that goes up every night at 7pm?

130
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,990
Yes! This rink is a special place

131
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,090
where you can see the fireworks and castle overlap.

132
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,790
You're quite knowledgeable!

133
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,090
That's why I've come here too!

134
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,190
I'm not going to watch it like always.

135
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,190
I'll go get a cup of coffee nearby.

136
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,990
I've seen the fireworks so many times before.

137
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,490
What? You're not going to watch either?

138
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,490
I'm a bit hungry.

139
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,990
I'll come back before the fireworks start,

140
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,190
so wait there for me.

141
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,890
Wait here?

142
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,790
I've been waiting to go to the toilet for a while now.

143
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,390
You may go!

144
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,890
We'll be skating nearby for a while yet so.

145
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,490
When your friends come all we have to do

146
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,090
is tell them to wait here, right?

147
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,990
Yes, I'm sorry to trouble you.

148
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,490
I'll be right back, so could you do that for me?

149
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,090
-Sure! -Sure!

150
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,990
"Toilet"

151
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,690
Hey...

152
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,990
It's already 5 minutes to the hour.

153
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,990
What on earth are you doing?

154
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,790
The fireworks will start if you don't hurry up.

155
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,790
They're all so late.

156
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,790
Sorry, Ran, I need to go to the toilet too.

157
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,790
Gosh!

158
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,790
You're late!

159
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:37,090
To the toilet...

160
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,090
What? What's wrong?

161
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,090
Look at this.

162
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,590
"Closed for cleaning. Please come back later." -What?

163
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,190
It can't be.

164
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,690
Wait a second!

165
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,690
It is a little late to claim the accident was my fault.

166
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:05,090
Besides, no matter how much you hide your face with that outfit,

167
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:08,990
if you shoot me, people will hear you and gather here,

168
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:13,190
then you'll be arrested right away.

169
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,890
Don't tell me that...

170
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:22,490
Excuse me.

171
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:29,190
Are you going to take a while longer?

172
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,790
This is bad, if it's not this toilet,

173
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,690
I'll have to change shoes.

174
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,190
Oh, no.

175
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,290
Hey, the fireworks have started already!

176
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,390
Did you see it?

177
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,390
Gosh!

178
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,590
How beautiful!

179
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:13,190
Really, the first ones are the most fantastic.

180
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,790
What? So, you came to watch after all.

181
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:21,290
Yes, I thought it'd be nice to watch fireworks once in a great while.

182
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,390
I made it!

183
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,390
I thought I was going to miss it.

184
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:30,390
What? Where are Chizu and your friend?

185
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,290
Didn't you see them at the toilet?

186
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,390
I wonder if I missed them.

187
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,890
They were cleaning the toilet,

188
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:40,690
so I changed shoes and went to a different toilet.

189
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,890
Sonoko sure is late, though.

190
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,590
Hey, that scream just now sounded like...

191
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,990
Sonoko!

192
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,490
Hey, kid!

193
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,390
Sonoko!

194
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,190
What's up?

195
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,490
What's the matter, Sonoko?

196
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:15,790
That...

197
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,490
"S"?

198
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,790
What does "S" mean?

199
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,080
Dad!

200
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,880
Dad! Get up!

201
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,880
Dad!

202
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,880
What is it, Ran?

203
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,480
I thought you wanted to leave after watching the fireworks.

204
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,280
There's no time for that!

205
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,180
There's been a murder! Homicide!

206
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,780
A person has been killed in the toilet near the skating rink!

207
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,780
What?

208
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:32,680
Someone slipped and fell in the toilet near the skating rink?

209
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,280
Gosh!

210
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,780
Come on!

211
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,980
Never mind, just come!

212
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,980
Hurry!

213
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:58,680
Why was Chizu killed? Why?

214
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,180
Police! Please let us through!

215
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,780
All right... Everyone except authorised personnel move back!

216
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,780
How ruthless.

217
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,180
Yes, indeed.

218
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,380
There's nobody inside, is there?

219
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,880
No, when we got here,

220
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,680
this boy was in here.

221
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,580
Conan?

222
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,580
Which means? Don't tell me that...

223
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,380
Well, this is a coincidence, just a mere coincidence!

224
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,580
Please don't get angry, Inspector Megure!

225
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,280
I don't have the energy to get angry.

226
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:44,280
Inspector! It seems that this shotgun is the murder weapon!

227
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,380
Okay, check the registration number of the gun

228
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,780
and find the owner of the gun.

229
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,380
That gun is mine.

230
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,280
It's the shotgun I use for Clay shooting.

231
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:00,080
I left it in the electronic lock locker with everyone else's.

232
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,080
What? Everyone else's?

233
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:08,280
Yes, the three behind you are members of the Clay shooting.

234
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,480
Who locked the electronic lock of the locker?

235
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,080
Me.

236
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,280
Everybody knows the number to the locker.

237
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,280
When we all came here before,

238
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,380
we all decided on the number together.

239
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,080
It's "9017".

240
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,580
Well, we'll find out soon enough after checking you four.

241
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:33,580
The one with gun powder reaction on their body is the killer.

242
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,980
All four of us will definitely have reaction!

243
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,880
We all went Clay shooting this afternoon.

244
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,280
Besides, maybe the locker wasn't locked as it should've been too.

245
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,180
If so, anyone could've taken the shotgun out of the locker and...

246
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,080
No, I don't think that's possible.

247
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,980
Have you forgotten?

248
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,180
Gun cases for shotguns are required to look like normal bags,

249
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,480
so people can't figure out what's inside.

250
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,880
Izumi's gun case is a plain leather case.

251
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,880
Moreover, the shotgun is disassembled,

252
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,780
so it's not something just anybody can handle.

253
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,180
I see,

254
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,880
so it has to be someone who knows that there is a shotgun inside the case.

255
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,580
Moreover, it has to be one who can assemble the gun.

256
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:20,080
Which means that the most likely suspect would still be among you four.

257
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,980
No way...

258
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:28,780
Well, the most important is to check for any witnesses

259
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,780
who saw any suspicious person near the toilet

260
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,280
around the time was committed!

261
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,080
-Yes, sir! -Well...

262
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,780
I saw it!

263
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,780
-What? -What?

264
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,380
The killer come out of this toilet.

265
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,480
Are you sure, Sonoko?

266
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,780
Yes.

267
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,680
There was a cleaning sign hanging on the door of this toilet.

268
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,680
There was no answer when I knocked,

269
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,880
so I was waiting in front of the door.

270
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,780
Then the fireworks started.

271
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,580
I pulled away from the door,

272
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,080
I tried to look at the fireworks from a window nearby.

273
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,880
It was at that moment!

274
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,780
A strange person wearing a long coat with

275
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:11,380
comes out of the toilet.

276
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,380
And did you see the face of that person?

277
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,580
No, the face was covered with the hood and a muffler.

278
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,980
If the killer shot the gun and muffled it with the sound of fireworks

279
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,180
and wore a long coat as disguise when fleeing,

280
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,780
this must be planned murder!

281
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,780
Please come to another room

282
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,080
so that I can separately ask you questions.

283
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,480
Then we can figure out who suggested to come to this amusement park.

284
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,480
Hey, just a minute! We all decided together to come here!

285
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,380
Well... you can talk more about it during questioning.

286
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,780
No, that's not necessary!

287
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,780
It hit upon me the minute I came to the scene.

288
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,580
But, Sonoko's remark just now verified my feelings.

289
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:01,080
The one who shot Ms. Itami to death is...

290
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,580
Ms. Izumi.

291
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,380
-What? -It's you.

292
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,980
Wait a minute! Don't be ridiculous!

293
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,680
Why me?

294
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,580
There are three factors why you are the killer.

295
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,880
First is this ladies' toilet which is the scene of the crime.

296
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,480
The killer hung the cleaning sign on the door to keep other people away,

297
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,680
then you kept the victim inside.

298
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,380
Which means the killer is a woman!

299
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,880
Second is your relationship with the victim.

300
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,880
You two were constantly arguing.

301
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,380
You both just couldn't get along with each other, isn't that right?

302
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,280
What're you talking about?

303
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,080
Are you going to set me up as the killer just like that?

304
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,080
Lastly, the most conclusive evidence is

305
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,280
the trace of blood on the wall beside the face of the victim.

306
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,580
Trace of blood?

307
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,780
To you, it may have looked like the trace of blood

308
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,580
that was made when the victim struggled.

309
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,780
But, it was clearly legible to my eyes.

310
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,680
Left behind before she ceased to breathe,

311
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,780
her dying message!

312
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,580
The "S" of the name Sano!

313
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:14,280
I asked you for your name before the Inspector got here.

314
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,680
The only one who has the letter "S" in the name is you!

315
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,980
Is that not right?

316
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,880
I don't think so!

317
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,280
Why?

318
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,080
I think you can tell just by looking,

319
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,080
the victim has been shot in the chest

320
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,880
and has died on the spot.

321
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,980
Therefore, it's impossible for her to write a message on the wall

322
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,980
after she was shot.

323
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,780
I guess you're right.

324
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:45,780
Besides, if a woman had relayed a message telling someone to wait here,

325
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:49,080
the person could've been a man.

326
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,680
Then, the letter "S" is...

327
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,980
Yes, someone left it there

328
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,980
to set Ms. Sano up as the killer.

329
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,780
Besides, the shotgun that was used as the murder weapon was also hers.

330
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,380
But, doesn't something bother you?

331
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,680
Sonoko knocked the door

332
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,680
just before the murder was committed, didn't she?

333
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,680
If the killer had the gun pointed at the victim all the while

334
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,580
before the fireworks went up,

335
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:20,480
why didn't she shout and call for help?

336
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,480
The killer was probably hiding in the toilet next door

337
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,280
until just before the fireworks went up.

338
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,080
What?

339
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,280
Something sticky is on it.

340
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,680
See, at the tip of the gun.

341
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,780
This... this is saliva!

342
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,680
I get it! The killer had the gun

343
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,080
pushed into the victim's mouth for a while

344
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,680
until the fireworks went up!

345
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,280
As the fireworks went up, the gun was moved to her chest...

346
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,580
If so,

347
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,580
then we three are not the killer!

348
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:57,580
Because we were at the skating rink with her before the fireworks went up.

349
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,780
Isn't that right, Ran?

350
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,880
Yes.

351
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,280
Were they really with you from the start?

352
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,380
It doesn't take 30 seconds from here to the rink.

353
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,680
But, all three of them were there

354
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,680
when the fireworks went up the first time.

355
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,580
It was no more than 10 seconds

356
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,280
between the first fireworks and the second.

357
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,780
And where were you then?

358
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,580
I was by the bench near the rink

359
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,580
with my back turned against the fireworks and smoking.

360
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,280
He is the only one without an alibi.

361
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,680
But, we still have no proof.

362
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,480
We don't know his relationship with the victim yet, either.

363
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,280
But, it's easy to tell that she doesn't like being cold.

364
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,380
See! She's about to be shot,

365
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,080
and yet she has her hand in her pocket!

366
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,280
A cellular phone?

367
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,980
There is nothing on the display.

368
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,080
Maybe she was shot before dialing 911.

369
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,080
Why don't you try re-dialing?

370
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,780
Then, maybe you can find out where she called last?

371
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,780
Let's give it a try.

372
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,080
KIX?

373
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,680
There are eight "#" symbol in the phone number row.

374
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,380
She probably tried to search her way through the numbers

375
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,980
but she failed to do it.

376
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,280
KIX?

377
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,980
KIX? Wait a second.

378
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,280
I have seen this from somewhere before.
