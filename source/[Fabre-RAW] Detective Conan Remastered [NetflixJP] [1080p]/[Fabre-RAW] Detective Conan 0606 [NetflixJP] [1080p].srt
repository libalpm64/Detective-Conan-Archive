2
00:00:08,302 --> 00:00:09,989
Have you made up your mind?

3
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:12,902
Yes, since it's a rare opportunity,

4
00:00:12,902 --> 00:00:16,302
I plan to take on the duty of lay judge if I am chosen.

5
00:00:16,302 --> 00:00:19,702
I see... if the time comes around,

6
00:00:19,702 --> 00:00:21,202
please don't worry about your classes

and complete your role as a lay judge to your heart's content.

Thank you very much.

Is this a new picture?

10
00:00:30,902 --> 00:00:32,702
It was donated by the chairman of the PTA.

11
00:00:32,702 --> 00:00:35,302
It's a pretty unusual picture, isn't it?

12
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:38,017
If you will excuse me...

Ms. Kobayashi!

16

Is it true that you were chosen to be a lay judge?

17
00:00:51,602 --> 00:00:54,402
Why do you know about it?

From our Youth Detective Squad network!

19
00:00:57,502 --> 00:01:01,002
What kind of case is the hearing for?

20
00:01:01,002 --> 00:01:02,702
There's this thing called duty of confidentiality,

21
00:01:02,702 --> 00:01:05,202
and you're not allowed to talk about the case!

22
00:01:05,202 --> 00:01:07,502
Just a little bit won't hurt, will it?

23

Just to us, the Youth Detective Squad!

24
00:01:10,402 --> 00:01:12,602
I said no, and I mean no.

25
00:01:12,602 --> 00:01:15,602
-Wait Ms. Kobayashi! -Just tell us!

26
00:01:15,602 --> 00:01:19,702
I wonder if Ms. Kobayashi's capable of serving as a lay judge?

27
00:01:19,702 --> 00:01:22,602
We should worry about it after she's chosen.

28
00:01:22,602 --> 00:01:23,702
True.

29
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,902
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

Tears are start of all dramas.

31
00:01:29,102 --> 00:01:31,202
Ms. Kobayashi becomes a lay judge?

32
00:01:31,202 --> 00:01:33,102
What are the contents of this case of concern?

33

"Toshio Iwamatsu (35)" -Yeah! I really didn't do it!

41
00:03:41,356 --> 00:03:45,056
Then why did you confess to the crime?

42
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:48,207
I told the police that I didn't do it, either!

43
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:51,656
But, I was pressed to confess because there was blood on my clothes.

44
00:03:51,656 --> 00:03:53,256
You mean the blood of the victim

45

that was on your clothes at the time you were arrested?

46
00:03:56,656 --> 00:04:01,856
Yeah... besides the hair and other stuff too.

47
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:05,556
The hair and footprints that were left behind at the scene of the crime.

They said they had all the evidence necessary so...

00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:11,356
That's why you signed the written confession form?

You just called the victim, Mr. Ishigaki "that guy",

Yes, your honor.

The defendant Toshio Iwamatsu

115
00:08:33,656 --> 00:08:37,956
broke into a residence located on 4-5 Akebono-cho,

116
00:08:37,956 --> 00:08:40,499
by cracking the window of the study of Mr. Tadashi Ishigaki,

the president of a real estate company, who owns the residence.

While he was rummaging the house,

00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:48,256
Mr. Ishigaki who came home and found him, confronted him.

120
00:08:48,256 --> 00:08:49,856
Then Iwamatsu who had a knife on him

121

-stabbed the victim in the stomach. -Objection!

122
00:08:53,456 --> 00:08:56,256
You say he possessed a knife,

123
00:08:56,256 --> 00:08:58,517
but was the murder weapon specified?

124
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:01,856
No, it hasn't been found yet.

125
00:09:01,856 --> 00:09:05,156
Please delete that point.

126
00:09:05,156 --> 00:09:06,525
Agreed.

127
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,529
Just as expected of mom.

00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:13,456
Not so fast, it's just started.

129

The whereabouts of the murder weapon is unknown.

130
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,537
The defendant with blood on his clothes

131
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:22,956
was found near the scene of the crime.

132
00:09:27,556 --> 00:09:29,256
And as a result of interrogation,

133
00:09:29,256 --> 00:09:31,556
he confessed to committing the crime.

134
00:09:31,556 --> 00:09:33,656
The charges and applicable penal statute is homicide,

135
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:37,756
Criminal Law Article 199.

136
00:09:39,956 --> 00:09:42,556
Does the defendant agree to the charges?

137
00:09:47,056 --> 00:09:50,056
I didn't do it! I'm innocent!

138
00:09:55,456 --> 00:09:57,856
What is your opinion, attorney?

139
00:09:57,856 --> 00:10:00,356
I plead not guilty on behalf of the defendant

140
00:10:00,356 --> 00:10:02,581
with regard to the murder charge.

141
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:03,556
Not guilty...

142
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:13,056
The court will now proceed to evidence examination.

143
00:10:13,056 --> 00:10:16,595
First, may I draw your attention to the autopsy report?

please confirm with the monitor display right in front of you.

00:10:26,956 --> 00:10:28,256
What could it be?

147
00:10:28,256 --> 00:10:30,609
I guess the corpse or something is being displayed.

148
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:31,756
What?

149
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,613
I wonder if Ms. Kobayashi's going to be okay.

150
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:37,356
It may be tough for lay citizens,

151
00:10:37,356 --> 00:10:40,956
but it is the work of the lay judges to perceive the facts.

152
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:45,156
The cause of death is exsanguinations

153
00:10:45,156 --> 00:10:46,625
through stab wounds in the abdomen.

154
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:49,656
The murder weapon is thought to be a sharp object.

155
00:10:49,656 --> 00:10:52,656
The blade seems to be approximately 15 centimetres.

156
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:57,956
We shall now proceed to witness testimony.

157

158

You're the housekeeper hired at the victim's residence, correct?

159
00:11:07,356 --> 00:11:10,956
Yes. I've worked for five years already.

160
00:11:10,956 --> 00:11:14,156
Please tell us about the time the incident occurred.

161
00:11:15,556 --> 00:11:20,659
I was cleaning the room on the second floor like always that day.

162
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:24,663
Then, I thought I heard noise from downstairs.

163
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:26,656
Since Mr. Ishigaki told me that

164
00:11:26,656 --> 00:11:29,056
he would be eating out after playing golf,

165
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:31,356
I thought I just imagined hearing something.

166
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:34,156
I finished cleaning and went downstairs.

167
00:11:38,256 --> 00:11:40,456
Are you back?

168
00:11:40,456 --> 00:11:42,681
I wonder why the window's open.

169
00:11:50,156 --> 00:11:51,656
Sir?

170
00:11:59,256 --> 00:12:00,456
That'll be all.

171
00:12:01,856 --> 00:12:05,956
Any questions from the defense?

172
00:12:05,956 --> 00:12:08,707
When you went to the room where the crime was committed,

173
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:11,556
you didn't see the culprit anywhere in sight, is that correct?

174
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:16,156
No, I just saw Mr. Ishigaki bleeding and lying on the floor.

175
00:12:17,856 --> 00:12:19,656
The lay judges should take note that

176
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,721
the witness is merely the primary discoverer,

177
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:24,723
and that she did not see the defendant

178
00:12:24,956 --> 00:12:28,056
and the victim confronting each other

179
00:12:28,056 --> 00:12:30,729
as the prosecutor had just read off.

180
00:12:34,956 --> 00:12:38,156
"Toru Tsukano (46)"

181
00:12:38,156 --> 00:12:41,456
You're the younger brother of the late wife

182
00:12:41,456 --> 00:12:42,756
of the victim, correct?

183
00:12:42,756 --> 00:12:47,956
Yes. I worked under Mr. Ishigaki as managing director.

184
00:12:47,956 --> 00:12:50,456
It seems that on that particular day you visited him about work

185
00:12:50,456 --> 00:12:52,751
and encountered that incident, correct?

186
00:12:52,956 --> 00:12:54,556
Regarding transactions,

187
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:57,556
we needed the president to settle the accounts immediately, you see.

188
00:12:59,556 --> 00:13:01,756
What's wrong, Ms. Hara?

189
00:13:03,256 --> 00:13:05,256
Did something happen?

190
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:08,456
Mr. Tsukano! Mr. Ishigaki's...

191
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:09,756
President...

192
00:13:11,756 --> 00:13:12,771
President!

193
00:13:17,956 --> 00:13:19,856
Ms. Hara, please call an ambulance right away!

194
00:13:19,856 --> 00:13:20,779
Yes, sir!

195
00:13:24,256 --> 00:13:26,785
Lay judges, after the death of my older sister,

196
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:28,787
the president was the only family member

197
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:31,656
that I had left that I could rely on.

198
00:13:31,656 --> 00:13:33,856
Please carry out the maximum penalty

199
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:36,256
to the one who took his life.

200
00:13:41,156 --> 00:13:45,756
Lay judges, if you have any doubts or questions,

201
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:48,156
please do not hesitate to ask.

202
00:13:48,156 --> 00:13:50,809
Then, if you will allow me...

203
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:52,356
Go ahead.

204
00:13:52,356 --> 00:13:54,813
I hear that the murder weapon hasn't been found yet,

205
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:58,817
but does that mean that the culprit fled along with it?

206
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:00,256
That is what we thought too,

207
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,756
so we've been trying to track down the culprit

208
00:14:01,756 --> 00:14:03,456
based on possible escape routes,

209
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:05,556
but we haven't come up with anything yet.

210
00:14:06,456 --> 00:14:09,356
The defendant was arrested 20 minutes

211
00:14:09,356 --> 00:14:11,556
after he was reported to the police.

212
00:14:11,556 --> 00:14:13,356
From the Ishigaki residence which is the scene of the crime

213
00:14:13,356 --> 00:14:14,456
to the place the defendant was arrested,

214
00:14:14,456 --> 00:14:17,356
even if he were to run at top speed, it would take more than 15 minutes.

215
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,356
Thus, it is unthinkable that the defendant had any extra time

216
00:14:20,356 --> 00:14:22,456
to get rid of the murder weapon

217
00:14:22,456 --> 00:14:24,456
outside the investigation area of the police.

218
00:14:25,456 --> 00:14:28,847
Then, where is the murder's weapon?

219
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:31,556
That's a tough one for Madonna.

220
00:14:31,556 --> 00:14:34,853
It's a tie for now.

221
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:37,256
What you're seeing now is the study

222
00:14:37,256 --> 00:14:40,356
where the crime was committed.

223
00:14:40,356 --> 00:14:42,356
The culprit snuck in from the window,

224
00:14:42,356 --> 00:14:44,056
and was rummaging through the room

225
00:14:44,056 --> 00:14:45,856
when the victim returned home and found him...

226
00:14:45,856 --> 00:14:47,456
Oh my...

227
00:14:47,456 --> 00:14:48,656
What is it?

228
00:14:59,256 --> 00:15:01,156
If you are in doubt of anything,

229
00:15:01,156 --> 00:15:02,881
please do not hesitate and ask.

230
00:15:02,881 --> 00:15:05,456
Yes, sir, then...

231
00:15:05,456 --> 00:15:06,556
Yes!

232
00:15:07,956 --> 00:15:10,889
Ms. Kobayashi, you don't need to raise your hand.

233
00:15:12,656 --> 00:15:13,656
Go ahead.

234
00:15:13,656 --> 00:15:18,356
The picture in the room, could it be that it's upside down?

235
00:15:18,356 --> 00:15:19,556
The picture?

236
00:15:19,556 --> 00:15:23,456
Yes. The same picture was decorated in the principal's room too.

237
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:24,903
So, perhaps...

238
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:29,556
It's true it's hard to tell which way is up with that picture.

239
00:15:29,556 --> 00:15:32,911
What does that have to do with the case, though?

240
00:15:35,656 --> 00:15:36,915
There has been no report of the picture

241
00:15:37,156 --> 00:15:39,856
being moved during investigation.

242
00:15:41,856 --> 00:15:43,656
The defendant doesn't seem to have any recollection

243
00:15:43,656 --> 00:15:45,756
whatsoever of the picture either.

244
00:15:45,756 --> 00:15:48,356
What does it matter?

245
00:15:48,356 --> 00:15:49,456
What?

246
00:15:49,456 --> 00:15:53,456
Right, who cares about such an incomprehensible picture?

247
00:15:53,456 --> 00:15:56,156
Let's say that it is as you say,

248
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:58,656
what does that have to do with this case?

249
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:02,256
I'm sorry. It's okay about the picture already.

250
00:16:02,256 --> 00:16:04,656
Please continue the hearing.

251
00:16:07,856 --> 00:16:10,456
The picture is upside down?

252
00:16:15,328 --> 00:16:17,828
Although there are disadvantageous evidence against the defendant,

253
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:20,328
Madonna seems to be having a tough time getting her point across.

254
00:16:20,328 --> 00:16:24,328
I guess Ms. Kisaki is much too difficult to take on.

255
00:16:24,328 --> 00:16:27,328
Mom's hanging in there, isn't she?

256
00:16:27,328 --> 00:16:29,328
For today, I guess.

257
00:16:29,328 --> 00:16:31,228
But, who knows if Madonna is the type

258
00:16:31,228 --> 00:16:33,428
to shrink away from something like this.

259
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:38,977
Conan, are you bothered about Ms. Kobayashi's question?

260
00:16:39,228 --> 00:16:42,028
If what Ms. Kobayashi said is true,

261
00:16:42,028 --> 00:16:44,983
I thought that maybe somebody could've turned the picture upside down.

262
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:47,928
It could be that Ms. Kobayashi's mistaken, right?

263
00:16:47,928 --> 00:16:49,628
I'm sure she's nervous too

264
00:16:49,628 --> 00:16:51,328
because she's acting as a lay judge for the first time too.

265
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:53,328
I guess so.

266
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:55,528
If the picture really is upside down,

267
00:16:55,528 --> 00:16:57,928
there should be a reason for why it's the way it is.

268
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,128
Shall we try going?

269
00:17:03,228 --> 00:17:04,728
I guess it's over here.

270
00:17:04,728 --> 00:17:07,628
They seem to have a guest over.

271
00:17:07,628 --> 00:17:10,628
Maybe we should wait until mom gets here?

272
00:17:10,628 --> 00:17:13,011
No way, who cares?

273
00:17:15,628 --> 00:17:17,728
This is the spot where he collapsed, right?

274
00:17:17,728 --> 00:17:20,428
My... what brings the great detective over here?

275
00:17:20,428 --> 00:17:22,428
Did Attorney Kisaki still want something?

276
00:17:22,428 --> 00:17:26,328
No, I've just come to check out the scene of the crime involving the case.

277
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:27,928
Are we intruding on you?

278
00:17:27,928 --> 00:17:29,328
Be my guest.

279
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:33,428
I was only confirming some things for the next hearing.

280
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:38,028
Have you found anything that can turn the case over in your favor?

281
00:17:38,028 --> 00:17:40,528
Did you already check the picture?

282
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:42,128
Picture?

283
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:44,028
One of the lay judges mentioned it, didn't she?

284
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:47,045
It's about that picture, right?

285
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:49,928
She mentioned something about the picture being upside down but...

286
00:17:49,928 --> 00:17:52,228
Ran, how is it when compared to the picture

287
00:17:52,228 --> 00:17:54,128
you were checking on the internet a while ago?

288
00:17:56,828 --> 00:17:59,428
No doubt about it. Just as Ms. Kobayashi pointed out,

289
00:17:59,428 --> 00:18:01,059
the picture is upside-down.

290
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:04,828
So, what does that have to do with the case?

291
00:18:04,828 --> 00:18:07,065
The owner of the picture wouldn't put the picture

292
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:09,067
on the wall upside down, would he?

293
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:13,071
So exactly who hang it upside-down?

294
00:18:13,328 --> 00:18:14,428
Take the picture down!

295
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:15,428
Yes!

296
00:18:19,628 --> 00:18:22,728
It was put on the wall with magnet.

297
00:18:24,028 --> 00:18:26,728
Don't tell me that this is...

298
00:18:26,728 --> 00:18:27,728
blood?

299
00:18:27,728 --> 00:18:29,628
It couldn't be.

300
00:18:29,628 --> 00:18:31,089
I can see if it were on the outside,

301
00:18:31,328 --> 00:18:33,928
but why would there be blood stains on the inside?

302
00:18:33,928 --> 00:18:37,095
Maybe somebody with bloody hands touched it.

303
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,128
An IOU?

304
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:45,428
The borrower's signed acknowledgement of the agreement and a bill?

305
00:18:45,428 --> 00:18:50,128
I see, so the picture frame was being used as a hidden safe.

306
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:53,111
This is...

307
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:56,328
An IOU amounting to three million yen?

308
00:18:56,328 --> 00:18:58,028
"Iwamatsu Toshio"

309
00:18:58,028 --> 00:19:00,428
The borrower is Iwamatsu?

310
00:19:00,428 --> 00:19:03,121
Isn't that the defendant's name?

311
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:05,928
If the defendant broke into the house

312
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:09,127
to search for this IOU to begin with...

313
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:12,128
We've found more than vital evidence.

314
00:19:13,128 --> 00:19:15,133
I've heard that the president,

315
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:17,628
other than his main line of work,

316
00:19:17,628 --> 00:19:22,028
was engaged in questionable monetary dealings behind the scenes.

317
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:25,143
Do you knew about this?

318
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:27,145
The president was very secretive about that case,

319
00:19:27,328 --> 00:19:29,147
so I don't think he told anyone about it.

320
00:19:29,346 --> 00:19:34,361
Moreover, I found out for the first time myself,

321
00:19:34,361 --> 00:19:37,155
that such a thing was hidden behind the picture.

322
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:39,157
Will you get the details from him over there?

323
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:40,061
Yes, ma'am.

324
00:19:41,761 --> 00:19:42,861
Please come with me.

325
00:19:45,461 --> 00:19:47,561
I've got to tell mom about this.

326
00:19:48,961 --> 00:19:50,861
Ms. Hara, how about you?

327
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:53,761
I knew nothing what so ever about the picture too.

328
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:55,161
If the defendant was the one

329
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:56,561
who put the picture back on the wall upside down,

330
00:19:56,561 --> 00:20:00,061
I wonder why he didn't take the IOU and all?

331
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:01,179
That's probably because

332
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:04,261
when he removed the picture and was about to check it,

333
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:07,185
he heard the housekeeper coming down from upstairs,

334
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:10,361
so hastily put the picture back on the wall upside down and fled.

335
00:20:10,361 --> 00:20:12,161
Why would he go through the trouble of putting it back on the wall

336
00:20:12,161 --> 00:20:14,561
when he could just easily flee together picture and all?

337
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:18,761
Because he stabbed somebody, was delirious,

338
00:20:18,761 --> 00:20:23,201
and couldn't think clearly! Do you understand?

339
00:20:23,361 --> 00:20:25,203
Something's not right.

340
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:27,561
I'm sure that anything being hidden behind the picture

341
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:29,561
would've had to be a secret.

342
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,761
Then, why did the culprit know about it?

343
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:40,561
Wasn't there a flower vase on top here?

344
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:42,161
What?

345
00:20:42,161 --> 00:20:43,221
A flower vase?

346
00:20:43,461 --> 00:20:46,461
See, because although there's a vase mat here,

347
00:20:46,461 --> 00:20:48,861
there's no flower vase on it.

348
00:20:48,861 --> 00:20:50,461
True.

349
00:20:50,461 --> 00:20:51,229
The surrounding area besides

350
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:53,561
where the flower vase must've been is discolored.

351
00:20:56,461 --> 00:20:58,461
Do you know something, Ms. Housekeeper?

352
00:20:58,461 --> 00:21:00,761
What?

353
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:05,243
It was a flower vase that Mrs. Ishigaki used to use.

354
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:06,961
It was placed there even after she passed away,

355
00:21:06,961 --> 00:21:09,961
but recently Mr. Ishigaki got rid of it.

356
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:11,261
Is that so?

357
00:21:11,261 --> 00:21:13,561
I thought that it dropped and cracked

358
00:21:13,561 --> 00:21:15,961
when he got into a struggle with the culprit or something.

359
00:21:15,961 --> 00:21:17,761
Even during investigation of the scene of the crime,

360
00:21:17,761 --> 00:21:19,961
no cracked fragments of a flower vase came up.

361
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:21,761
But, Conan, was that your name?

362
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:24,961
You've really got a keen sense of observation, I should say.

363
00:21:24,961 --> 00:21:27,661
He always notices the trivial things.

364
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,361
If you will excuse me, then.

365
00:21:30,361 --> 00:21:31,961
Strange.

366
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:33,271
The way the woman looked really flustered

367
00:21:33,461 --> 00:21:35,561
when I asked about the flower vase.

368
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:37,061
She must know something.

369
00:21:41,761 --> 00:21:44,461
I hear you found Mr. Iwamatsu's IOU.

370
00:21:44,461 --> 00:21:49,961
It seems that the defendant had a motive for killing the victim.

371
00:21:49,961 --> 00:21:54,361
So, he didn't randomly break in to the house simply to steal?

372
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:59,297
I will submit it as crucial evidence at the next hearing.

373
00:22:02,361 --> 00:22:05,303
Wouldn't it be better if you just withdraw

374
00:22:05,303 --> 00:22:08,961
the not guilty plea and enter a plea bargain instead?

375
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:11,309
I don't need you to worry about

376
00:22:11,461 --> 00:22:15,077
how I carry on my defense strategies.

377
00:22:15,077 --> 00:22:19,317
Why do I care if you embarrass yourself in front of the lay judges?

378
00:22:19,317 --> 00:22:20,995
Mom, are you going to be all right?

379
00:22:20,995 --> 00:22:22,395
I'll be fine, Ran.

380
00:22:22,395 --> 00:22:25,323
The more disadvantageous the case seems to be,

381
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:28,195
the more fired up I get, okay?

382
00:22:29,995 --> 00:22:32,095
In order to get out of this fix,

383
00:22:32,095 --> 00:22:34,895
the truth about this case has to be disclosed.

384
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:38,095
And, I'm sure that the key are the upside down picture

385
00:22:38,095 --> 00:22:40,795
and whereabouts of the lost flower vase!

386
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,740
Next Conan's Hint:

387
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,423
"Flower Vase"

388
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,425
I dropped the flower vase!

389
00:24:07,674 --> 00:24:09,427
-What? -Flippity flop.

390
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,920
What?
