1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,870
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,570
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,370
After a long interval, the young detectives are back again.

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,370
Mitsuhiko is acting weird.

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,870
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,770
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,070
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,460
Hold your arms out front and now raise them. Now stretch.

9
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,260
Good. One, two, three, four,

10
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,160
five, six.

11
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,060
Now for your arms and legs.

12
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,460
One, two, three, four

13
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,860
five, six, seven, eight...

14
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,260
Good grief.

15
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,160
I should be enjoying the summer of my junior year in high school.

16
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,460
Spin your arms outwards.

17
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,760
What the heck am I doing here?

18
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,660
Inwards.

19
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,960
Five, six, seven, eight.

20
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,160
"Mitsuhiko Lost In The Woods (Part 1)"

21
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,960
Radio exercise.

22
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,660
One, two...

23
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,960
Hey, Conan. Stop slacking off.

24
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,560
These exercise classes

25
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,160
are a very important part of our summer newsletter.

26
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,960
Yes, I bet.

27
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,560
She's right.

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,660
If you don't exercise properly now,

29
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,060
you'll regret it when you're older.

30
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,160
You might get high blood pressure,

31
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,660
diabetes, arteriosclerosis

32
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,360
and that might cause brain haemorrhages

33
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,160
and heart attacks.

34
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,560
One, two, three, four.

35
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,560
Well, I guess Dr. Agasa needs it.

36
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,860
By the way, what's this about a summer newsletter?

37
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,160
The Summertime News.

38
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,660
We're filling it with summer events.

39
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,260
Remember what the Dr. Agasa said at the fireworks display?

40
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,060
He said those kinds of newsletters

41
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,160
are rarely seen in the city these days.

42
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,160
And all they carry

43
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,160
are news about fireworks and these exercises.

44
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,860
Speaking of rarely seen,

45
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,560
he's not here today either. That Mitsuhiko.

46
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,260
I wonder if something's wrong.

47
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,060
He skipped a few times before, too.

48
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,160
He probably couldn't get up in time.

49
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,060
That's odd.

50
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,360
He's not loose like you, Genta.

51
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,760
He always arrives early.

52
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,360
-True. -Loose?

53
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,060
What part of me is baggy?

54
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,460
That's not what he meant.

55
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,860
Why don't we all go to Mitsuhiko's house after this?

56
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,660
He might have come down with a summer cold or something.

57
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,060
Good idea.

58
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,460
You mean Mitsuhiko wasn't there?

59
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,660
That's strange. He said he was going to go camping

60
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,060
with all of you after today's exercises.

61
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,360
Camping?

62
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,960
Yes. He was so excited last night.

63
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,860
He filled his bag with sweets.

64
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,960
He said he was going to share them with all of you.

65
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,960
Sweets?

66
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,260
Yes. The lady next door gave them to us.

67
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,060
But I guess he wasn't going camping after all.

68
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,860
What? I guess not.

69
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,660
Asami, do you have any idea where'd he go?

70
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,760
Some place where'd he sneak off to.

71
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,360
No. He'd only been hanging around you guys lately.

72
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,060
Oh, right.

73
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,460
Maybe you'd like to take a look in his room?

74
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,360
He sometimes leaves notes behind when he goes out.

75
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,060
What?

76
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,260
That's strange.

77
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,960
I don't think he left a note.

78
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,760
And his wallet's gone, too.

79
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,960
His wallet?

80
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,960
Seeing as he took non-perishable food and wallet

81
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,360
when he snuck out,

82
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,860
I think he intended to go far away.

83
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,660
Hey. You don't mean...

84
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,760
Probably, he ran away from home.

85
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,460
-Ran away from home? -Ran away from home?

86
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,360
You're kidding! Really?

87
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,160
This is like a movie!

88
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,460
What are you so happy about?

89
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,560
Even if he didn't run away from home,

90
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,660
he's been planning this for some time. I'm sure of that.

91
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,060
See. This is his exercise card.

92
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,460
He's skipped every Sunday.

93
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,660
You're right.

94
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,560
So Sunday's the key to his disappearance.

95
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,360
Maybe he was going on a date or something.

96
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,660
No way.

97
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,660
A date?

98
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,560
Well, he did mention that older girl.

99
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,760
She worked in the flower shop her family owned during weekend.

100
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,560
I remember he said that girl once praised him.

101
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,560
Maybe she asked him for a date and took him to the beach?

102
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,260
Why the beach?

103
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,860
Because he asked to borrow my sunscreen last night.

104
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,060
I bought it on the shop channel, it's foreign made and expensive.

105
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,060
I find it hard to believe.

106
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,160
That serious Mitsuhiko...

107
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,160
With a girl...

108
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,260
On the beach...

109
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,260
Eating sweets.

110
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,160
Not a romantic picture.

111
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,960
Asami, dear!

112
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,460
You're going to be late for your piano lesson unless you hurry!

113
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,060
Yes, mother. I'm coming.

114
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,060
Both our parents are school teachers,

115
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,160
so they're very strict about the language we use.

116
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,560
No wonder Mitsuhiko talks the way he does.

117
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,460
All right. If you find out anything interesting,

118
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,360
call me on my cellular.

119
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,060
I'd really like to know about Mitsuhiko's love life.

120
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,060
Her little brother's disappeared

121
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,460
but how can she so nonchalant?

122
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,960
It's unbelievable, right?

123
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,260
You're right.

124
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,960
What? Mitsuhiko?

125
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,260
You mean Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya?

126
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,260
He hasn't been by today.

127
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,260
Even at about 6:30 this morning?

128
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,660
We don't open until 7 am,

129
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,060
and I was at the exercises at 6:30 am.

130
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,560
So I would know if he came by at that time or not.

131
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,760
I guess you wouldn't.

132
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,160
But I did see him last Sunday morning at the bus stop

133
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,460
when I was on my way to the exercises.

134
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,760
It looked like he was being scolded by some older men.

135
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,260
He was being scolded?

136
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,560
Yes. Something about they won't tell him

137
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,060
and he shouldn't go get it.

138
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,860
What was he not supposed to go get?

139
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,560
I don't know.

140
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,860
They mentioned the name of a samurai from long ago.

141
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,160
Let's see. Was it Uesugi? Takeda?

142
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,360
No. Maybe Toyotomi or Tokugawa.

143
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,960
Did you say Tokugawa?

144
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,060
Maybe it's about the Tokugawa hidden treasure!

145
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,360
I'll bet the treasures buried in some beach.

146
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,060
That's what Mitsuhiko's gone to look for.

147
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,460
Darn it. That little sneak...

148
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,260
-Here we go again. -wants to keep it all to himself!

149
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,060
-I'm going to make him share it with. -Has Mitsuhiko disappeared?

150
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,060
Yes. He left for some place this morning but no one knows where.

151
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,560
It must have been him that I saw this morning then.

152
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,460
I saw a boy at the bus stop this morning.

153
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,160
He had his cap pulled down low

154
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,360
and was carrying a back pack.

155
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,760
He smelled kind of strange.

156
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,560
It looked like Mitsuhiko, so I called him out.

157
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,760
But he ignored me and boarded the bus.

158
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,160
What do you mean he smelled strange?

159
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,560
It wasn't exactly strange.

160
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,060
It was more tangy like a lemony smell.

161
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,860
A lemony smell?

162
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,060
Yes. That kid got on my bus.

163
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,660
His cap was pulled down low and he smelled like lemons, right?

164
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,860
I knew it. He's a runaway, isn't he?

165
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,860
We don't know if he did yet.

166
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,160
Well, you see. When kids get on the bus,

167
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,060
they usually look out the window.

168
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,660
But that kid sat in the back of the bus

169
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,760
and he looked like he was worried about something.

170
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,160
He just stared straight ahead

171
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,660
and it looked like he might be hiding from something.

172
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,660
He looked worried?

173
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,860
Like he was hiding?

174
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,660
Yes, I was right!

175
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,260
That Mitsuhiko's run away from home!

176
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,660
Don't say that.

177
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,460
Do you remember where he got off?

178
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,160
Let me think.

179
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,360
I'm pretty sure it was Beika Station.

180
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,060
What? A boy that smelled like lemon?

181
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,960
I'm not really sure.

182
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,160
He had a cap on and he was carrying a backpack.

183
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,660
Hey, I think I know which kid they're talking about.

184
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,860
Remember? He bought an adult ticket by mistake.

185
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,060
He was in a rush and wanted us to exchange it right away.

186
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,260
He was in a hurry?

187
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,760
Yes. He was really scared.

188
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,960
Like somebody was after him or something.

189
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,560
Do you know where he was heading?

190
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,460
Let's see.

191
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,560
It was an adult ticket for 190 yen.

192
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,860
So it'd probably be to the Chiba area

193
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,160
or maybe Gunma area.

194
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,960
It's no use.

195
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,760
Nobody who works here's seen him.

196
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,960
That means

197
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,360
he might have transferred to another line somewhere.

198
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,660
This is our last hope.

199
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,760
Yes. That boy passes through here.

200
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,960
-Really? -We did it!

201
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,360
We're a small station.

202
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,660
We don't have those automatic ticket gates like in the big city.

203
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,360
So I'd notice any kid that acted as suspicious as him.

204
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,460
He was the last to get off

205
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,560
and then he hid behind the station building.

206
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,960
But right after that, he ran off towards the mountain.

207
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,060
Well, well.

208
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,760
We got this far on only these clues, he smelled like lemons,

209
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,060
wore a cap and was carrying a backpack.

210
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,260
And the sun's starting to go down, too.

211
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,760
Hey, hey. Wait a minute.

212
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,960
There's nothing around here.

213
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,560
How are we gonna find him?

214
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,060
Don't worry. We've got this.

215
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,860
See, it's located the signal from Mitsuhiko's detective badge.

216
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,060
He's around here for sure.

217
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,660
What a relief.

218
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,660
Gosh. If he's got his badge with him

219
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,660
then all we've got to do is radio him.

220
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,260
I've been trying to, but he doesn't answer.

221
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,260
Well, we can find him faster

222
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,560
by tracking him with those tracking glasses.

223
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,260
Doesn't it bother you though?

224
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,360
Mitsuhiko always does everything by the book

225
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,160
and he's super careful.

226
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,760
Why do you think he went off into the mountains

227
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,960
without discussing it with us first?

228
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,660
Maybe he's running away from home after all.

229
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,060
Okay, okay. Don't go jumping to conclusions.

230
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,560
It might be something very innocent.

231
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,060
Like maybe he just fell in love with a girl

232
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,560
and he followed her all the way here.

233
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,560
Love can make you do crazy things.

234
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,160
He fell in love?

235
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,360
It happens and as they said,

236
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,760
"First love is lemon flavoured."

237
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,860
Come on! Let's go, guys.

238
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,460
-Huh? -We've gotta find him before it gets dark.

239
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,860
Wait for me!

240
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,960
It seems like he's someplace in this forest.

241
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,460
Now, what? Is he still not answering?

242
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,860
Yes. I'm pretty sure he can hear the beep though.

243
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,160
Hey. There's people over there.

244
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,860
Let's go and ask them if they've seen Mitsuhiko.

245
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,160
Wait a minute. I'll go.

246
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,460
You kids stay here.

247
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,060
Hey, come back here!

248
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,560
They may be dangerous people!

249
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,460
Hey! You guys over there!

250
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,360
Detective Yamamura of the Gunma Prefecture Police.

251
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,260
What's this? Aren't you the boy with Mouri's agency?

252
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,960
What're you doing in a place like this?

253
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,560
What... what do you mean by the way?

254
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,360
Hello there.

255
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,360
What's going on here?

256
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,360
It's not safe for you here.

257
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,260
I want all unauthorized people out of this forest right now.

258
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,160
Not safe?

259
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,060
Has a bear been sighted?

260
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,160
A man that more dangerous than a bear

261
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,960
is hiding out around here.

262
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,860
A man?

263
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,560
The truth is...

264
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,960
I can't say this out loud.

265
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,960
It seems a veteran cop let him get away

266
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,560
during inspection of the crime scene.

267
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,560
It's that serial killer, Kiichiro Numabuchi.

268
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,660
Are you serious?

269
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,760
I... I don't believe it.

270
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,460
Come on, keep moving.

271
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,060
Hey!

272
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,460
Hey. Are you okay?

273
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,760
Hey!

274
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,660
Move it!

275
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,060
The guy I ran into in Osaka is here in this forest.

276
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,360
That's why you've got to leave right now.

277
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,960
But one of their friends is in here.

278
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,960
Hey, Conan.

279
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,760
We've got to let Mitsuhiko know about this.

280
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,260
Gosh! Why aren't you answering, Mitsuhiko?

281
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,460
There's a boy somewhere in here?

282
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,860
In the same forest a murderer is hiding out in?

283
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,260
Yes, that's right.

284
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,460
Why didn't you keep a closer eye on him?

285
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,660
You brought them here, didn't you?

286
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,460
No, I didn't.

287
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,160
That idiot Mitsuhiko came here on his own

288
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,860
without telling us about it.

289
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,760
And we asked all the people at the train stations if they saw him

290
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,760
and that's how we ended up here in Gunma Prefecture.

291
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:01,560
And we tracked him with the detective badge he has on,

292
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,360
that's why we came to this forest.

293
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,960
We used my tracking glasses.

294
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,960
Detective badges and tracking glasses?

295
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,360
My parents bought me those when I was a kid, too.

296
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,060
It's in the detective kit.

297
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,160
I got two magic pen, words you write it with it disappear

298
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,460
then there's the magic card where smoke appears when you rub it,

299
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,260
and then there's the secret paper that disintegrates in water.

300
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,660
One day though, I started to have my doubts.

301
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,260
I couldn't figure out how these things

302
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,260
could help in a real investigation.

303
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,060
Now, kids!

304
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,960
I want you to go somewhere else and play detective,

305
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,260
toys like that aren't dependable.

306
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,060
You don't know for sure if your friend is here!

307
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,660
You don't understand. We're not playing.

308
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,260
Honestly, we're telling the truth.

309
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,660
Mitsuhiko really is around here.

310
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,260
Since you're insisting so strongly, show me some proof.

311
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,260
Let me see those so called tracking glasses.

312
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,560
See, just push the button on the frames like this.

313
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,360
The batteries are dead?

314
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,160
I knew it. They're just ordinary glasses.

315
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,060
No. The batteries are dead, that's all.

316
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,060
What?

317
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,260
Hey, Yamamura. What're you doing?

318
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,660
Come on. We're going to go look for Numabuchi.

319
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,860
I know, but these kids...

320
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,460
Numabuchi got away because you took your eyes off him!

321
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,160
You'd better find him fast!

322
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,260
No, sir. That's not...

323
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,660
Just take those kids to a safe place,

324
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,560
then join the manhunt.

325
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,960
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

326
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,760
Good grief.

327
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,960
He's the one who left Numabuchi alone

328
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,060
and went to relieve himself behind the bushes.

329
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,360
I thought he was with the prisoner.

330
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,360
That's why I wasn't paying close attention to him.

331
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,560
Which means it actually was your fault he escaped.

332
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,560
Well, I guess you could say that.

333
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,960
My goodness.

334
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,560
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

335
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,160
Where are you?

336
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,360
Come out! Come out wherever you are!

337
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,660
Hey!

338
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,460
How long are you going to keep this up?

339
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,460
That kid's probably already back home by now.

340
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,860
You kids go on home.

341
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,360
When it gets dark,

342
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,960
even someone who knows these woods like me, could get lost.

343
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,760
I'm not afraid of the dark.

344
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,860
Because we've got these.

345
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,760
They sure sell some handy things lately.

346
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,260
We didn't buy these.

347
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,660
Dr. Agasa made them for us.

348
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,960
Dr. Agasa? Made them for you?

349
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,760
That's right. I invented this and made them for the kids.

350
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,060
I also made those tracking glasses

351
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,060
and that detective badge with the radar.

352
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:53,260
So, wait a second. Don't tell me...

353
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,860
you were telling the truth about a boy wandering around here?

354
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,160
We were telling you the truth, of course!

355
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,660
That's why we're searching like this.

356
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,760
Why didn't you tell my superior that back there?

357
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,460
We told you already.

358
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,560
I... I've got to report this to my superior.

359
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,360
Darn it!

360
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,160
I left my cellular phone in the police car.

361
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,060
I'm... I'm done for.

362
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,660
I let the prisoner escape during the investigation.

363
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,960
I didn't tell to my senior

364
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,260
that a child had wandered into the woods.

365
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,060
I'm going to be discharged, I know it.

366
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,060
I joined the police

367
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,160
because I loved watching detective shows

368
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,360
and I finally got to become a detective.

369
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,060
Maybe being a detective wasn't right for me.

370
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,360
I guess I'm just not cut out for this job.

371
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,160
That's not true.

372
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,860
That's okay. You don't have to cheer me up.

373
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:51,960
But you solved a lot of cases before.

374
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,660
There's the Yoshifusa Yabuuchi case.

375
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,360
Then, the lawyer's case in Karuizawa.

376
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,060
And the Kashiragami Forest case, too.

377
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,660
You did a fantastic job on all those cases.

378
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,660
-Is that true, Conan? -That's amazing!

379
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,160
You... You think so?

380
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,860
Of course, it was either me or my dad that solved them though.

381
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,360
I noticed you had a wide forehead and look intelligent.

382
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,660
He's the intelligent cop type.

383
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,360
You think so?

384
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,060
Now, Detective Yamamura.

385
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,160
Let's get back to our search.

386
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,560
You know these woods better than anybody. We're counting on you.

387
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,660
No, Dr. Agasa.

388
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,960
From now, I want you to call me...

389
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,760
Yama. I'd appreciate that.

390
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,960
Yama?

391
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,360
I think he's been watching too many detective shows.

392
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,060
It's beeping again.

393
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,760
It must be Conan.

394
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,560
I knew they'd come look for me.

395
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,160
But if I take it off now and talk to them,

396
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,760
all my effort would have been in vain.

397
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,760
No. I wouldn't let that happen.

398
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,100
Next Conan's Hint:

399
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,940
"The General's name"

400
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,720
-Next episode... -Look out, Mitsuhiko.

401
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,160
Mitsuhiko, you little sneak.

402
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:41,440
Mitsuhiko, you did pretty good.
