1
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:08,893
Dr. Agasa took us to a hot spring inn in Hakone.

2
00:00:08,893 --> 00:00:11,991
The filming for the newest version of the movie

3
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:14,693
called the "Blood Smoke Hitman" was taking place there.

4
00:00:14,693 --> 00:00:17,693
"Ganji Tetsuyama (67)" -We met scriptwriter, Mr. Ganji Tetsuyama,

5
00:00:17,693 --> 00:00:21,193
"Mishio Natori (28)" -the actress playing the heroine Ms. Mishio Natori,

6
00:00:21,193 --> 00:00:24,393
"Junsaku Tanzawa (34)" -her manager Mr. Junsaku Tanzawa,

7
00:00:24,393 --> 00:00:28,893
"Unpei Terado (33)" -and the lead actor Mr. Unpei Terado.

8
00:00:28,893 --> 00:00:30,593
Early in the morning the following day,

9
00:00:30,593 --> 00:00:33,093
we went to the lake top outdoor spa

10
00:00:33,093 --> 00:00:37,093
and found Mr. Tetsuyama murdered in the women's bath.

11
00:00:39,193 --> 00:00:40,393
Judging from the circumstances,

12
00:00:40,393 --> 00:00:42,021
the culprit most likely waited for Mr. Tetsuyama

13
00:00:42,193 --> 00:00:44,693
outside the spa all night and ambushed him,

14
00:00:44,693 --> 00:00:48,027
then mingled among the crowd after committing the crime.

15
00:00:50,893 --> 00:00:54,293
The only guests who walked around alone the night before were...

16
00:00:54,293 --> 00:01:00,039
Ms. Mishio, Mr. Tanzawa and Mr. Terado.

17
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,793
The culprit is most probably among the three.

18
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:26,065
Brooding over passing seasons

19
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:27,793
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

20
00:01:27,793 --> 00:01:29,593
An actor falls into a trap.

21
00:01:29,593 --> 00:01:31,693
The spa mystery is finally solved.

22
00:01:31,693 --> 00:01:33,293
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,193
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:35,193 --> 00:01:37,493
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

25
00:03:01,929 --> 00:03:07,129
"Yukemuri Locked Room Scenario (Part 2)"

26
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:10,169
If so, the culprit is...

27
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:12,529
the woman right here!

28
00:03:12,529 --> 00:03:14,729
Last night I overheard Mr. Tetsuyama

29
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:17,229
talking on the phone in the lobby.

30
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:19,829
He was saying, "So you've finally decided to do it."

31
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:21,329
"Let's take a dip in the open-air bath on the lake

32
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:22,929
with the morning sun shining on us."

33
00:03:22,929 --> 00:03:25,229
Or, "If you don't like the lead actor,

34
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:27,929
I could make a switch."

35
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:31,729
I'm sure she used her feminine wiles to lure Mr. Tetsuyama here and...

36
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:33,129
I see...

37
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:36,729
If so, I can see why he was found dead in the women's spa.

38
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:37,929
How about it?

39
00:03:37,929 --> 00:03:41,729
Were you the one talking to him on the phone?

40
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:43,929
Yes, it was I.

41
00:03:43,929 --> 00:03:46,205
I told him that if he came to the women's spa first thing in the morning,

42
00:03:46,429 --> 00:03:50,209
I would soak in it until the other guests came.

43
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:52,211
But, I was just lying.

44
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:54,829
I only wanted to teach that perverted man a lesson

45
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:57,829
by standing him up and embarrassing him.

46
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,729
I wasn't the only actress who was fed up

47
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:03,529
with Mr. Tetsuyama sexual harassment.

48
00:04:03,529 --> 00:04:08,929
Which means, that you both had a motive for killing Mr. Tetsuyama.

49
00:04:08,929 --> 00:04:11,029
Hey, hold it.

50
00:04:11,029 --> 00:04:13,229
This guy has a motive too.

51
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:15,729
Five years ago his role as leading actor

52
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:17,229
was suddenly taken away from him by Mr. Tetsuyama.

53
00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:19,829
And he hasn't acted since then.

54
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,329
Is that true?

55
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,129
Yes. I resented him a bit back then,

56
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:27,529
but now I'm grateful for what he did.

57
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:29,029
Because thanks to him,

58
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:32,251
I'm experiencing a variety of things other than being an actor.

59
00:04:32,429 --> 00:04:34,253
It's not that I hated him to the point

60
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:35,929
of wanting to kill him either.

61
00:04:35,929 --> 00:04:38,257
Same here.

62
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:39,229
Inspector Yokomizo.

63
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:40,529
What?

64
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:43,329
This was found in the back of a basket in the changing room.

65
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:45,629
A PET of Japanese tea.

66
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:48,829
It's not tea that's inside it, though...

67
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:52,029
Yes. It looks like plain water.

68
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:54,829
And, burnt remains of matches were found

69
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:57,029
floating on the lake near the site of the crime.

70
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:59,529
Burnt remains of matches?

71
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:00,629
Why?

72
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:02,929
Excuse me,

73
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:06,285
why not have those three people meet

74
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:07,929
with the employees who were at the entrance

75
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:10,289
of the wharf from the main building?

76
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:14,293
Right. If he were hiding here all night,

77
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:17,829
he wouldn't have passed through that entrance yet, no?

78
00:05:17,829 --> 00:05:20,929
Yes. Well... you see, as for this floor

79
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:22,301
the lights are set at low

80
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:24,929
and kept dim until 6 am in the morning.

81
00:05:24,929 --> 00:05:28,307
Many people from the police and all passed through here today,

82
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:30,309
so I really can't tell who's who.

83
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:33,029
I do remember that Mr. Tetsuyama was the very first to come here

84
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:37,029
and the children came here right after him though...

85
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:38,317
You told us that Mr. Tetsuyama

86
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:40,729
has a special privileges and gets to enter that outdoor spa

87
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:42,129
earlier than anyone else,

88
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:43,529
does he always do so?

89
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:47,129
Yes, Mr. Tetsuyama loves to be the first to take a bath.

90
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:49,429
So, when he stays at this inn

91
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:53,029
the lights in the spa are turned on before 4:30 am,

92
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:55,929
and we let him go through quite early.

93
00:05:55,929 --> 00:05:57,129
Inspector.

94
00:05:57,129 --> 00:06:00,339
It seems that one of the rings of the victim is missing.

95
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:01,529
Ring?

96
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:05,429
Yes. Only an empty case was left back at the room.

97
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:09,629
On the case it said, "Nichiuri TV Newcomer Scenario Award".

98
00:06:11,429 --> 00:06:14,929
You mean the ring with the soybean sized jewel on it.

99
00:06:14,929 --> 00:06:17,329
That's right, the silver one.

100
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:20,359
He used to wear it to parties

101
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:21,829
or when he had to make speeches

102
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:24,129
saying that it was like a good-luck charm for him.

103
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:25,429
You can't find it anywhere?

104
00:06:25,429 --> 00:06:26,829
No, sir.

105
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:28,629
It was probably disposed of into the lake

106
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:30,629
along with the murder weapon.

107
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:33,529
Didn't anything come out of the rooms of these three?

108
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:35,929
No, but there's something that bothers us in each room.

109
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,329
What?

110
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:39,629
The ashtray of Mr. Terado's room

111
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:41,529
was full of burnt remains of matches.

112
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:42,381
Matches?

113
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:46,385
What's wrong with lighting cigarettes with matches?

114
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:48,387
Inside the bag found in Mr. Tanzawa's room,

115
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:50,129
we found gloves,

116
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:52,029
but for some reason they were only for the left hand.

117
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:54,029
They are golf gloves.

118
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:56,395
A lot of people wear them only on their left hand

119
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:57,829
to keep their hand from slipping.

120
00:06:57,829 --> 00:06:59,929
Me too, since I'm right handed.

121
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:03,129
And, from the wastebasket in Ms. Natori's room,

122
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:04,403
we found a cracked wine glass cup

123
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:08,029
and on the table, a script with several pages crumpled.

124
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,029
I was playing the role.

125
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:12,411
When I was reading the script last night

126
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:14,429
there was a scene where the character ripped out paper

127
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:16,829
and threw a wine glass at the person she was with.

128
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:22,729
I did it almost unconsciously.

129
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:24,829
Concentrating my all into becoming the character

130
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:26,729
is my style of acting.

131
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:29,729
Concentrate on the role and become the character.

132
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:35,029
I see. So, that's the story.

133
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:37,429
The culprit got too absorbed in his role,

134
00:07:37,429 --> 00:07:39,529
and forgot completely

135
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:42,029
that he had hidden the conclusive evidence

136
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:45,429
inside his own pocket.

137
00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:47,829
Inspector Yokomizo.

138
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:50,829
I've spoken with the inn employees at the front desk.

139
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:53,429
-And? -They said that around 5:30 am this morning,

140
00:07:53,429 --> 00:07:56,129
Ms. Natori turned her room key in to the front desk

141
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:58,229
and still hasn't come to pick it up.

142
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:01,129
Mr. Terado at about 2 am this morning,

143
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:03,129
called an employee up to his room

144
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:05,283
saying that the air conditioner had broken down.

145
00:08:05,283 --> 00:08:08,096
Well, it turned out I wasn't operating it correctly though.

146
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:10,096
Then, what about Mr. Tanzawa stopping

147
00:08:10,096 --> 00:08:12,471
at the front desk to get loose change at about 4:30 am?

148
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:14,196
That's been confirmed too.

149
00:08:14,196 --> 00:08:16,796
He exchanged 1000 yen to 100 yen coins.

150
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,477
What?

151
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:19,396
Hey.

152
00:08:19,396 --> 00:08:20,796
Before we, the police came,

153
00:08:20,796 --> 00:08:22,996
is it really true that not even a single person

154
00:08:22,996 --> 00:08:24,996
went back to the main building from the wharf?

155
00:08:24,996 --> 00:08:26,485
No, sir.

156
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:28,996
If so, these three people would've been

157
00:08:28,996 --> 00:08:31,396
at the main building this morning,

158
00:08:31,396 --> 00:08:32,496
so the deduction about the culprit hiding

159
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:35,196
all night inside the lake top outdoor spa

160
00:08:35,196 --> 00:08:39,096
that the brat made was completely off the mark?

161
00:08:39,096 --> 00:08:40,896
But that's...

162
00:08:44,196 --> 00:08:45,196
Dr. Agasa.

163
00:08:45,196 --> 00:08:46,496
So, you're up.

164
00:08:48,496 --> 00:08:51,196
If so, the culprit must've come into the outdoor spa

165
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:53,096
from the lake after all,

166
00:08:53,096 --> 00:08:57,396
and after killing Mr. Tetsuyama returned to the lake and fled.

167
00:08:57,396 --> 00:09:00,519
Okay. Go ask around the places surrounding the lake...

168
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:03,696
I don't think that will be necessary.

169
00:09:03,696 --> 00:09:07,696
Why? Because the killer is here...

170
00:09:07,696 --> 00:09:10,096
right in front of my eyes.

171
00:09:20,856 --> 00:09:21,856
Hey, hey...

172
00:09:21,856 --> 00:09:25,056
I don't have any idea about the murder, you know.

173
00:09:25,056 --> 00:09:28,056
Never mind just pretend to talk along with my voice.

174
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:29,356
What is this?

175
00:09:29,356 --> 00:09:31,156
Butting in all of a sudden.

176
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:33,056
No, I just...

177
00:09:33,056 --> 00:09:35,056
I'm saying that despite traces of someone

178
00:09:35,056 --> 00:09:39,156
having been hiding by the outdoor spa all night...

179
00:09:39,156 --> 00:09:42,156
Are you guys so blind that you can't see it?

180
00:09:42,156 --> 00:09:43,956
Traces?

181
00:09:43,956 --> 00:09:46,556
The bottle of green tea that for some reason had water in it

182
00:09:46,556 --> 00:09:48,567
and was found in the changing room

183
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:50,256
and the burnt remains of matches

184
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,571
that were found floating in the lake are evidence.

185
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:56,356
It's too cold to wait all night outside the outdoor spa on the lake,

186
00:09:56,356 --> 00:09:59,756
where the wind blows through during this season.

187
00:09:59,756 --> 00:10:03,156
And even if you were to enter the spa from the veranda,

188
00:10:03,156 --> 00:10:04,356
with the lights and the heater turned off,

189
00:10:04,356 --> 00:10:08,587
it would be impossible to endure the cold in the changing room.

190
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:11,356
The only way to keep warm is...

191
00:10:11,356 --> 00:10:14,593
Don't tell me the culprit went into the spa?

192
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:16,056
Yes, that's right.

193
00:10:16,056 --> 00:10:17,456
After the culprit drank up all the tea,

194
00:10:17,456 --> 00:10:19,456
judging from the fact that the culprit drank up not only the green tea

195
00:10:19,456 --> 00:10:20,599
but refilled the bottle repeatedly with water

196
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:22,601
from the sink of the changing room,

197
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:25,656
I'm sure that the culprit soaked repeatedly in the water all night.

198
00:10:25,656 --> 00:10:28,607
Soaking in the spa makes you thirsty.

199
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:30,356
Then, what about the burnt remains of the matches

200
00:10:30,356 --> 00:10:32,156
that were afloat in the lake?

201
00:10:32,156 --> 00:10:35,156
The culprit smoked to stay awake.

202
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:39,656
And did so on the veranda to avoid making the spa smell of smoke.

203
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:41,656
Which means that the suspicious one would be you

204
00:10:41,656 --> 00:10:43,556
because you had cigarettes on you.

205
00:10:43,556 --> 00:10:45,356
Hey, hey, I...

206
00:10:45,356 --> 00:10:48,256
I said the culprit smoked.

207
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:50,656
I didn't say the culprit smoked cigarettes.

208
00:10:50,656 --> 00:10:52,156
What?

209
00:10:52,156 --> 00:10:55,356
Not cigarettes...

210
00:10:55,356 --> 00:10:56,956
A pipe?

211
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:01,256
Wait. If the culprit waited while smoking a pipe...

212
00:11:01,256 --> 00:11:03,856
Yeah, that's right.

213
00:11:03,856 --> 00:11:08,156
The one who was hiding all night by the lake top outdoor spa was...

214
00:11:08,156 --> 00:11:11,756
the one who was killed, Mr. Tetsuyama.

215
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:13,556
-What? -What?

216
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:16,956
Then, who is the Mr. Tetsuyama that went pass this entrance here

217
00:11:16,956 --> 00:11:18,656
at 4:30 am in the morning?

218
00:11:18,656 --> 00:11:20,659
That one's the killer.

219
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:24,156
He was disguised as Mr. Tetsuyama.

220
00:11:24,156 --> 00:11:25,656
In other words, by reversing the common sense

221
00:11:25,656 --> 00:11:28,256
that there would be no reason for the victim to hide

222
00:11:28,256 --> 00:11:32,671
at the would-be crime scene for a long time for the culprit,

223
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:34,956
we were thrown off by a psychological trick that was set up.

224
00:11:34,956 --> 00:11:37,356
Hey, is that right?

225
00:11:37,356 --> 00:11:39,456
You guys let Mr. Tetsuyama pass through

226
00:11:39,456 --> 00:11:41,156
the entrance to the outdoor spa, didn't you?

227
00:11:41,156 --> 00:11:45,156
Well, I think it was him.

228
00:11:45,156 --> 00:11:47,656
His unique way of walking.

229
00:11:47,656 --> 00:11:49,956
And, the stern facial expression he wore,

230
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:52,956
as if coercing us were manners that only belonged to Mr. Tetsuyama.

231
00:11:52,956 --> 00:11:56,256
However, back then, this floor was dimly lit

232
00:11:56,256 --> 00:11:58,256
and moreover, that person

233
00:11:58,256 --> 00:12:01,356
was wearing a knitted cap, wearing glasses

234
00:12:01,356 --> 00:12:04,056
and had a towel around him as if it were a muffler, right?

235
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,356
Yes.

236
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:08,056
I see.

237
00:12:08,056 --> 00:12:11,256
You knew Mr. Tetsuyama very well

238
00:12:11,256 --> 00:12:12,711
so as an actor and former actor,

239
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:16,715
you both could've acted out being Mr. Tetsuyama

240
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:19,156
if you wanted to.

241
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,719
Hold it.

242
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:22,721
If so, this woman who's also

243
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:24,723
an actress should be suspected too.

244
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:26,156
If she wears many layers of clothing,

245
00:12:26,156 --> 00:12:28,256
she could imitate his physique,

246
00:12:28,256 --> 00:12:29,556
and if he wore a stern facial expression,

247
00:12:29,556 --> 00:12:31,656
she wouldn't have had to say a word.

248
00:12:31,656 --> 00:12:34,056
She also told him that if he came to the women's spa

249
00:12:34,056 --> 00:12:35,356
first thing in the morning,

250
00:12:35,356 --> 00:12:37,556
she would bathe with him until the other guests came.

251
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:41,356
If she made him promise to hide in the women's spa all night

252
00:12:41,356 --> 00:12:43,356
then it all fits in, doesn't it?

253
00:12:43,356 --> 00:12:45,256
That's true,

254
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:50,456
if the person on the other side of the line was really her.

255
00:12:50,456 --> 00:12:53,956
Really her? Are you saying she's lying?

256
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:57,956
She had to say so to protect him.

257
00:12:57,956 --> 00:13:02,156
Mr. Terado was watching Mr. Tetsuyama talking on the phone

258
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,356
and if Ms. Natori completely denies

259
00:13:04,356 --> 00:13:06,156
that she wasn't the one who was talking on the other side of the line,

260
00:13:06,156 --> 00:13:09,956
there would only be one person left who would turn out to be the culprit.

261
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,256
Ms. Natori's manager, Mr. Tanzawa.

262
00:13:14,556 --> 00:13:16,156
You're the only one.

263
00:13:16,156 --> 00:13:17,756
Just what're you talking about?

264
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:19,056
I'm not lying.

265
00:13:19,056 --> 00:13:24,356
Mr. Tanazawa probably told Mr. Tetsuyama

266
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:26,156
that Ms. Natori will be going first thing

267
00:13:26,156 --> 00:13:28,256
in the morning to take a bath at the outdoor spa on the lake.

268
00:13:28,256 --> 00:13:30,356
If you want to watch her taking a bath,

269
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:34,793
stay in hiding all night and wait for her.

270
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:36,795
A strategy that only you,

271
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:39,756
as her manager could've carried out.

272
00:13:39,756 --> 00:13:41,656
Mr. Tetsuyama, because of that phone call

273
00:13:41,656 --> 00:13:46,056
remarked, "So, she's finally decided to listen to me."

274
00:13:46,056 --> 00:13:50,256
I'll bet Mr. Tetsuyama nagged you repeatedly about this.

275
00:13:50,256 --> 00:13:51,856
Of course, Mr. Tetsuyama

276
00:13:51,856 --> 00:13:53,556
could've come to the spa first thing in the morning

277
00:13:53,556 --> 00:13:55,656
and hid in the women's spa.

278
00:13:55,656 --> 00:13:57,156
But, if Ms. Natori finds out

279
00:13:57,156 --> 00:14:00,056
that Mr. Tetsuyama went to the outdoor spa before her,

280
00:14:00,056 --> 00:14:03,356
you probably talked him in by saying that she may get suspicious.

281
00:14:03,356 --> 00:14:05,156
This way, you, Mr. Tanazawa,

282
00:14:05,156 --> 00:14:08,827
made Mr. Tetsuyama hide on the veranda of the women's bath,

283
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:10,056
and you headed for the outdoor spa

284
00:14:10,056 --> 00:14:13,856
a little before 5 am in the morning.

285
00:14:15,156 --> 00:14:18,356
Then, you took off your disguise in the changing room.

286
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:20,256
And, you probably fast talked Mr. Tetsuyama

287
00:14:20,256 --> 00:14:22,056
into coming into the spa, saying where he was wasn't good.

288
00:14:22,056 --> 00:14:24,856
Then, you struck him with a blunt weapon and killed him.

289
00:14:24,856 --> 00:14:26,845
After that, you planned to re-enter

290
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:30,556
the spa amidst the confusion, didn't you?

291
00:14:30,556 --> 00:14:34,556
Because you figured that maybe some of your hair may be found in the spa.

292
00:14:34,556 --> 00:14:38,456
But, the children came earlier than expected,

293
00:14:38,456 --> 00:14:41,356
and instead of getting all worked up over finding the dead body

294
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:44,556
they blocked the entrance to the spa.

295
00:14:44,556 --> 00:14:46,356
Although you wanted to hide the traces

296
00:14:46,356 --> 00:14:48,656
of you being at the scene of the crime,

297
00:14:48,656 --> 00:14:51,456
you just couldn't come around to doing so.

298
00:14:51,456 --> 00:14:53,556
That's why Mr. Tanazawa, who had no other choice...

299
00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:56,156
Hey, you're talking like you actually saw everything but...

300
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:58,056
Do you have proof or what?

301
00:14:58,056 --> 00:15:00,256
Yes, that evidence is...

302
00:15:00,256 --> 00:15:02,881
What are you doing in secret, Conan?

303
00:15:03,056 --> 00:15:06,885
That's the voice changer bow-tie, isn't it?

304
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:08,887
Are you talking in Dr. Agasa's voice?

305
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:10,556
You can't talk in your own voice?

306
00:15:10,556 --> 00:15:13,956
No. He's helping Dr. Agasa who doesn't know

307
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,856
anything about the case out by whispering from behind.

308
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:17,356
I see.

309
00:15:17,356 --> 00:15:18,897
Thanks, Ai.

310
00:15:19,056 --> 00:15:20,656
Don't worry.

311
00:15:20,656 --> 00:15:23,856
I won't let them take a peek like you did.

312
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:24,903
Peek in?

313
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:30,156
As to that, you don't have to worry about it either.

314
00:15:30,156 --> 00:15:32,056
All I got to see is your butt.

315
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,656
Butt?

316
00:15:33,656 --> 00:15:35,856
What about... butt?

317
00:15:35,856 --> 00:15:37,256
Nothing...

318
00:15:37,256 --> 00:15:40,456
Shoots. I talked in Dr. Agasa's voice.

319
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:42,656
But, he knew something.

320
00:15:42,656 --> 00:15:44,923
Something that only the culprit would've known.

321
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:47,456
Mr. Tanzawa that is...

322
00:15:47,456 --> 00:15:50,056
That's why Mr. Tanzawa took the lead

323
00:15:50,056 --> 00:15:52,656
and step foot into the spa.

324
00:15:52,656 --> 00:15:54,256
That's the evidence.

325
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:55,756
What?

326
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:57,956
Because the children were blocking the entrance,

327
00:15:57,956 --> 00:16:01,656
it's only natural to want to find out what's going on inside.

328
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:04,456
But, the scene was the women's spa you know.

329
00:16:04,456 --> 00:16:06,656
Wouldn't you normally ask a woman

330
00:16:06,656 --> 00:16:08,947
to go check the place out first of all.

331
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:10,556
Yes.

332
00:16:10,556 --> 00:16:12,756
Mr. Tanzawa already knew...

333
00:16:12,756 --> 00:16:15,556
that in the spa, there would only be Mr. Tetsuyama's dead body

334
00:16:15,556 --> 00:16:17,756
and the children.

335
00:16:17,756 --> 00:16:19,656
He also knew that even if he inevitably happened to look

336
00:16:19,656 --> 00:16:20,959
at the naked bodies of the children,

337
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,956
it would not be a problem.

338
00:16:27,456 --> 00:16:29,456
What's wrong, Ai?

339
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:33,656
You're emitting a sinister and dreadful aura.

340
00:16:33,656 --> 00:16:36,056
You look scary.

341
00:16:36,056 --> 00:16:39,356
That's proof? What a laugh.

342
00:16:39,356 --> 00:16:42,981
If it's immovable evidence, you know of it too, don't you?

343
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:45,656
That Mr. Tanzawa still has it on him.

344
00:16:48,656 --> 00:16:51,456
It's that ring that you said on the spur of the moment,

345
00:16:51,456 --> 00:16:53,856
had a soybean size jewel on it,

346
00:16:53,856 --> 00:16:55,456
in order to protect him.

347
00:16:55,456 --> 00:16:57,256
She said to protect him?

348
00:16:57,256 --> 00:17:00,999
Yes. If it were a ring with such a large jewel on it,

349
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:03,756
it would be readily apparent if you wear it on your finger.

350
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,156
You would never think that the blackened ring

351
00:17:06,156 --> 00:17:11,956
that Mr. Tanazawa is wearing on the finger of his left hand is the one.

352
00:17:11,956 --> 00:17:13,011
What?

353
00:17:15,756 --> 00:17:17,015
This?

354
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:20,256
When he was told to show you his belongings...

355
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:26,356
he remembered that he had forgotten that in the left pocket of his slacks,

356
00:17:26,356 --> 00:17:30,156
the ring that he had forgotten to dispose of was still inside.

357
00:17:30,156 --> 00:17:32,556
So, he fuddled inside his pocket and wore the ring on his middle finger

358
00:17:32,556 --> 00:17:34,356
by sticking his hand into his pocket.

359
00:17:34,356 --> 00:17:36,756
He also made sure that he wore the ring so the jewel would be hiding,

360
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,056
facing the palm of his hand.

361
00:17:39,356 --> 00:17:41,956
But, why did he go out of his way to wear the ring?

362
00:17:41,956 --> 00:17:46,056
Because the silver sulfurized and blackened.

363
00:17:46,056 --> 00:17:48,356
This hot spring is a sulfur spring.

364
00:17:48,356 --> 00:17:51,756
Reacting to the hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide,

365
00:17:51,756 --> 00:17:54,756
the surface of the silver ring sulfurized and blackened.

366
00:17:54,756 --> 00:17:57,856
Seeing the blackened ring,

367
00:17:57,856 --> 00:18:00,656
he figured he had to remove the ring.

368
00:18:00,656 --> 00:18:04,356
He feigned coming to take a bath just now and yet

369
00:18:04,356 --> 00:18:08,556
he didn't want to be suspected of having soaked in the spa for a long time.

370
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:11,556
Well, but if the spa has a highly concentrated content of sulfur in it,

371
00:18:11,556 --> 00:18:15,073
the ring would blacken in no time at all.

372
00:18:15,256 --> 00:18:17,075
But, what an idiot...

373
00:18:17,256 --> 00:18:18,756
to forget to dispose of it.

374
00:18:18,756 --> 00:18:21,079
He couldn't help it.

375
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:23,856
Because he was playing the role of being Mr. Tetsuyama.

376
00:18:23,856 --> 00:18:27,556
Mr. Tetsuyama always held his pipe in his left hand

377
00:18:27,556 --> 00:18:29,356
so he was probably left-handed.

378
00:18:29,356 --> 00:18:31,656
That's why you put the ring in your left back pocket

379
00:18:31,656 --> 00:18:34,056
that you normally don't put anything inside, right?

380
00:18:34,056 --> 00:18:36,556
You just planned to leave it there until you were ready

381
00:18:36,556 --> 00:18:38,856
to dispose of the blood spattered bathrobe and outer robe,

382
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:41,556
as well as the murder weapon into the lake.

383
00:18:41,556 --> 00:18:43,101
You pushed the button of the vending machine

384
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:47,956
with your left hand and called me "brat", too...

385
00:18:47,956 --> 00:18:49,956
You were playing the role of Mr. Tetsuyama

386
00:18:49,956 --> 00:18:51,956
already from that time, right?

387
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:53,111
Yes.

388
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:54,856
I really had it tough

389
00:18:54,856 --> 00:18:58,056
because I never acted the role

390
00:18:58,056 --> 00:19:00,356
of such a narrow minded man like him.

391
00:19:00,356 --> 00:19:01,856
Hey. Don't tell me...

392
00:19:01,856 --> 00:19:04,256
It's because you held a grudge against Mr. Tetsuyama

393
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:06,256
for taking your role as leading actor away from you five years ago.

394
00:19:06,256 --> 00:19:10,256
Yes, to put it simply that was my motive.

395
00:19:10,256 --> 00:19:13,956
The role I was denied was for the middle aged hitman,

396
00:19:13,956 --> 00:19:17,556
in Scarlet Wellspring that is currently being made.

397
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:21,139
Since I received rave reviews for the youth part,

398
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:23,141
I thought that I would naturally be continuing the role.

399
00:19:23,356 --> 00:19:25,456
Maybe he thought that you were still too young

400
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,656
to act out the role?

401
00:19:27,656 --> 00:19:31,149
Yes. I thought so too.

402
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:33,151
Because he also told me that I was too young,

403
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:35,456
that I lacked the melancholic feeling that ripens with age,

404
00:19:35,456 --> 00:19:39,456
and that I should accumulate more diverse experiences and all.

405
00:19:39,456 --> 00:19:44,356
That's why I quit acting and started working as her manager.

406
00:19:44,356 --> 00:19:46,756
I experienced what I never got to experience when I was an actor.

407
00:19:46,756 --> 00:19:50,556
I experienced the hardships of being on the bottom of the ladder.

408
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:54,856
I got to thinking that he wanted me to go through all of what I did.

409
00:19:54,856 --> 00:19:58,456
And, I found out that they would be filming Scarlet Wellspring again,

410
00:19:58,456 --> 00:20:02,056
so I called and pleading with him to give me the part,

411
00:20:02,056 --> 00:20:03,181
but he was so wasted

412
00:20:03,356 --> 00:20:06,156
that he didn't recognize that it was me on the phone.

413
00:20:06,156 --> 00:20:09,556
Junsaku Tanzawa to play the leading role as the hitman?

414
00:20:09,556 --> 00:20:13,656
No. He won't do. He's too good.

415
00:20:13,656 --> 00:20:15,756
Just like when he played the youth part,

416
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,956
I don't want to feel vexed after he's reputed by the public

417
00:20:17,956 --> 00:20:20,456
as acting the part out way better than the original work.

418
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:25,203
No matter what I did, he wasn't going

419
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:28,056
to give me the part of the middle aged hitman.

420
00:20:28,056 --> 00:20:29,656
Unfortunately, that is,

421
00:20:29,656 --> 00:20:33,956
so long as he remains in this world...

422
00:20:33,956 --> 00:20:36,856
The black and white version of the Scarlet Wellspring

423
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:38,556
that I saw as a child

424
00:20:38,556 --> 00:20:41,556
was what intrigued me to become an actor,

425
00:20:41,556 --> 00:20:43,756
so I wanted the part at all costs.

426
00:20:43,756 --> 00:20:45,856
But, thinking back,

427
00:20:45,856 --> 00:20:50,056
maybe I couldn't have acted it out after all.

428
00:20:50,056 --> 00:20:56,456
If I was able to become a hitman soon after I killed him,

429
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:59,656
I wouldn't have goofed in this way.

430
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:00,956
Mishio.

431
00:21:00,956 --> 00:21:03,241
Act the part of the woman owner of the inn with all your might

432
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:08,656
because it's a part that will open up the breadth of your roles.

433
00:21:08,656 --> 00:21:10,556
I can't,

434
00:21:10,556 --> 00:21:11,856
because you're the one who taught me

435
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:14,656
that I'd have to live the role I'd be acting

436
00:21:14,656 --> 00:21:17,255
even in my private life until the filming is completed.

437
00:21:17,456 --> 00:21:21,556
The one who hired the hitman was the woman herself.

438
00:21:21,556 --> 00:21:26,256
In order to conceal this fact without batting an eyebrow.

439
00:21:26,256 --> 00:21:31,656
The woman attempts to kill the killer in cold blood.

440
00:21:31,656 --> 00:21:34,356
I can no longer...

441
00:21:34,356 --> 00:21:36,856
go on acting this role.

442
00:22:58,156 --> 00:23:01,156
Okay, everybody, don't forget your things.

443
00:23:01,156 --> 00:23:02,456
Yes!

444
00:23:02,456 --> 00:23:04,156
We should get one more souvenir.

445
00:23:04,156 --> 00:23:07,365
Hey, Dr. Agasa. Come here for a while.

446
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:09,956
After I changed clothes after taking a bath,

447
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:12,656
there's a stinging feeling on my butt.

448
00:23:12,656 --> 00:23:13,856
Will you take a look at it for me?

449
00:23:13,856 --> 00:23:15,373
Okay...

450
00:23:15,373 --> 00:23:16,956
Talking of hot springs,

451
00:23:16,956 --> 00:23:20,456
Ai was at the men's spa a while ago.

452
00:23:20,456 --> 00:23:22,156
What? Why?

453
00:23:22,156 --> 00:23:23,381
I wonder...

454
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:26,056
She was saying that she was looking for something.

455
00:23:27,856 --> 00:23:29,756
It's a bit red and swollen.

456
00:23:29,756 --> 00:23:32,456
No joke?

457
00:23:32,456 --> 00:23:33,756
-What? -What?

458
00:23:33,756 --> 00:23:35,756
That's red pepper...

459
00:23:35,756 --> 00:23:38,956
If you rinse it off with water, you'll be just fine.

460
00:23:38,956 --> 00:23:42,456
There's red pepper powder on the inside of your undies.

461
00:23:42,456 --> 00:23:43,401
What?

462
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:46,756
Well, there's nothing to worry about.

463
00:23:46,756 --> 00:23:48,956
It's only the naked body of a child.

464
00:23:48,956 --> 00:23:52,356
It's no problem if anyone sees it, right?

465
00:23:55,656 --> 00:23:57,756
That rat...

466
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,700
Next Conan's Hint:

467
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,052
"Automatic Wicket".

468
00:24:06,052 --> 00:24:07,180
The next episode, "A Friend of Justice"

469
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:08,744
It's about Yaiba.

470
00:24:08,744 --> 00:24:10,640
No, he's not appearing. It's about me, then.

471
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:41,180
What?
