1
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,340
Evacuation of residents in a three-block radius has been completed.

2
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:44,240
Defusal at Location One is now in progress.

3
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,040
Defusal at Location One has been completed.

4
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,340
The helmet is equipped with a duct for cooling

5
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,140
for respiration that alternates as the mist remover for the lens.

6
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,440
And we are heading to Location Two with Officer Matsuda with us.

7
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,940
To protect against the hot air of explosion,

8
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,240
the structure of the protective gear does not allow any openings.

9
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,740
The pockets all over the wear have metal protective plates in them.

10
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,440
The gear is so complex that you cannot put it on by yourself.

11
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,940
It weighs 40 kilograms.

12
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,940
In the protective gear, it's a sauna even in cold winter.

13
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,840
You can't keep wearing it for more than five minutes.

14
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,540
I'd say it's impossible.

15
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,940
All police units, all police units.

16
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:43,440
Disperse from area 1.

17
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,440
Proceed to secure area 2...

18
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,440
All units in city limits,

19
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,640
watch out for suspicious vehicles.

20
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,340
That is all.

21
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,740
DC unit 80, roger that.

22
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,640
AV unit, roger that.

23
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,540
Keep cool and collected.

24
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,740
No baggage, please. Evacuate quickly and quietly.

25
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,840
Please be careful not to push others.

26
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,040
There is no need to rush.

27
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,040
Evacuation of the residents of this building is completed.

28
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,640
Roger.

29
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,140
"Kenji Hagiwara" -Well, let's start...

30
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,140
working on it.

31
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,140
"Jimpei Matsuda, MPD Riot Squad Bomb Disposal Unit"

32
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,040
You've done a good job, Matsuda.

33
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,740
How's Hagiwara?

34
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,740
Well, analysis shows a photosensitive trigger.

35
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,340
A white cord from a mercury tilt switch.

36
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,440
From the LCD panel...

37
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,640
Matsuda. What's up?

38
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,440
Hagiwara! What's taking you so long?

39
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,540
Go, tear it apart fast.

40
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,440
You're too loud, man.

41
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,640
You're making my fingers shake.

42
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,340
Have you finished already?

43
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,640
Yeah.

44
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,040
I opened it and found out it's rather simple clockwork.

45
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,240
It's so simple.

46
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,340
Three minutes was long enough?

47
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,240
How about yours?

48
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,440
Takes more than 3 minutes for sure.

49
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,540
It looks simple, but there're so many traps around it.

50
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,940
I suppose this is the real one.

51
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,540
Right.

52
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,340
By the way, you're in protective gear, aren't you?

53
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,440
In that hot torturing thing? No way.

54
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,340
Moron! You want to get killed, man?

55
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,440
Well, you can get the guy for me.

56
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,940
Are you trying to get on my nerves?

57
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,040
Can't take a joke?

58
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,540
I'm not a klutz.

59
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,340
Anyway, finish ASAP and get on back here.

60
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,240
I'll buy you a drink tonight.

61
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,740
Lucky me!

62
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,340
You lured me into full throttle.

63
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,340
I'm gonna work at full speed.

64
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,240
What's that?

65
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,840
What's up, Hagiwara?

66
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,740
Run, everybody!

67
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,240
Get out of here!

68
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,740
The timer started counting again!

69
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,140
Hagiwara?

70
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,440
Hey! Hagiwara!

71
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,040
Hagiwara...

72
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,640
Hagiwara!

73
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,840
Why? How did you find out?

74
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,140
I asked that boy wearing glasses.

75
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,240
So, that's why.

76
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,040
By the way, Shinichi,

77
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,540
what're you going to do about the all-country sim-test?

78
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,840
All-country sim-test?

79
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,940
You can't make it, can you?

80
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:57,140
I'll bet you're going to say you're tied up with a new case or something.

81
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,540
Wait! What's this?

82
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,140
"I have stolen your sleeping face." -How did you do that?

83
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,640
Gotcha!

84
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,340
Gosh.

85
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,880
Dad, Conan!

86
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,080
Don't be late. Breakfast is ready!

87
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,680
Dad.

88
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,480
What's all the commotion about from so early in the morning?

89
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,280
It's noon already.

90
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
I'm going to prepare for tomorrow test.

91
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,380
Sonoko and I are going to work on it today.

92
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,480
Will you finish up quickly?

93
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,080
That's your problem, not mine.

94
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,980
You're taking your report to a client, aren't you?

95
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,680
And, Conan, you promised Ayumi and the others

96
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,580
that you'll go to Haido Shopping Mall with them.

97
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,380
Yeah.

98
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,780
Haido Shopping Mall?

99
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,480
Oh, the mall with that huge Ferris Wheel.

100
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,880
Yeah.

101
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,580
January 6th, Monday.

102
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,580
The Winter holidays were almost over.

103
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,480
That first day started very peacefully

104
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,680
but the following two days were turned out to be a nightmare.

105
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,980
"Unsettled Metropolitan Police Department, 12 million hostages"

106
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,780
Sato, what do you think of this disguise of mine?

107
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,080
It's cool, isn't it?

108
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,880
Sato?

109
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,580
What's the matter with you? Anything wrong?

110
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,880
Sato?

111
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,180
Miwako?

112
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,080
Hey, Miwako.

113
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,680
Miwako!

114
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,580
Yumi.

115
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,580
What's the matter with you? In a coma or something?

116
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,980
I'm all right.

117
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,780
Just a little tired, I guess.

118
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,680
I'm going out for a while.

119
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,480
I thought you said you were going to do paperwork all day today.

120
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,280
I just remembered something. I have to go out, and take a look.

121
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,880
Don't forget the karaoke tonight.

122
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,480
Oh, yeah. What time was it?

123
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,080
Nine o'clock.

124
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,780
I sent mail to your cell. You can look at it.

125
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,080
Huh?

126
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,980
Well...

127
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,080
Sorry. I've deleted it already.

128
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,980
Gosh. Stop deleting mails right after you finish reading them.

129
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,280
That's one of your bad habits.

130
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,480
If I don't delete them, I'll soon get a mailbox full of junk mails

131
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,680
and lose track of important mails.

132
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,080
So, you mean mine is not important.

133
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,680
That's not what I meant.

134
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,880
You better not.

135
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,980
Okay. Nine o'clock.

136
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,380
Don't be late!

137
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,780
Roger and out.

138
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,180
Mail that you can't delete...

139
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,280
"Haido Shopping Mall"

140
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,080
It's so high!

141
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,080
Really. Great!

142
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,980
This Ferris Wheel is 125 meter high.

143
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,080
It's the highest in Japan.

144
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,880
It takes 18 minutes to make one round.

145
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,280
I could make six cups of ramen!

146
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,580
The diameter of the circle is 105 meters

147
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,580
and it takes 18 minutes to go once around.

148
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,380
That means the speed of this car

149
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,680
is about 30 centimeters per second.

150
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,180
Come on. Can't you think of anything else?

151
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:34,480
Oh? Such as the power necessary to make one round?

152
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,980
Cut it out.

153
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,580
It's been three years now.

154
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,980
Everybody. Let me introduce...

155
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,180
Mr. Jimpei Matsuda.

156
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,580
He will start working with us as of today

157
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,880
in the Criminal Investigation Section.

158
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,480
He has been in the Security Department, Special Task Force,

159
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,380
and I'd say that he is a bit of a stranger here.

160
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,980
We can do without that kind of introduction, Inspector.

161
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,380
I'm not exactly a new kid from the country.

162
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,280
And I don't think this show and tell about me

163
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,680
would be of any use to anybody.

164
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,480
I was stationed where I don't want to be

165
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,380
and I'm upset about it.

166
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,080
Well then, Officer Sato!

167
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,480
You help him out and...

168
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,480
Me, sir?

169
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,680
Don't shy away!

170
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,480
He is here for certain reasons,

171
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,380
and they asked me in person to play along.

172
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,480
Will you take care of him?

173
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,880
Yes, sir.

174
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,280
Hey, what kind of questioning was that supposed to be?

175
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,480
Questioning people like a mobster like that,

176
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,780
nobody will answer you.

177
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,180
Gosh. You have been with us for 6 days now.

178
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,780
Why don't you listen to me and do as I say?

179
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,080
Oh, you got mail?

180
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,680
You're pretty fast.

181
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,180
Yeah.

182
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,380
I just happen to be clever with my fingers.

183
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,780
Are you mailing your girlfriend?

184
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,980
No. I'm sending my best friend mail,

185
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,780
though I know he's not going to write back to me

186
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,580
because he blew up 4 years ago.

187
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,880
What?

188
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,980
Pass? Pass what? Are you crazy?

189
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,880
I have to wait here today.

190
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,580
I'm sure you guys can bring the old suspect

191
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,080
from the local police up here without me.

192
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,680
Now, you listen to me.

193
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,480
I am.

194
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,080
You said you receive it on January 6th every year. Today is the day.

195
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:56,480
Yes. Every year for three years,

196
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,380
you mean the fax with just one large number on it, right?

197
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,080
Number 3 was written on it three years ago;

198
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,580
number 2, two years ago,

199
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,180
and number 1, a year ago.

200
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,580
I'm sure

201
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,280
it's the time bomb count down.

202
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,080
If the guy's making any moves, today is the day.

203
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,780
Inspector! We got one this year, too.

204
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,180
That fax with a number on it, you mean.

205
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,380
And? What is the number this time?

206
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,680
It's not a number this time.

207
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,080
"I am a knight of the round table.

208
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,280
Let the foolish, cunning police know that

209
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,280
today at noon, at the 14th hour,

210
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,580
we will bury the head our fellow knight,

211
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,480
and in his memory, we will set off fireworks.

212
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,080
If you want to stop it, come to us.

213
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,180
We prepared the 72nd seat for you and we are ready."

214
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,880
What does it mean?

215
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,080
I don't know.

216
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,180
Hey! Just where do you think you're going?

217
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,180
Where else?

218
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:05,380
The knight of the round table says there are 72 seats.

219
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,580
If it's round and has 72 seats,

220
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,780
it's the big Ferris Wheel...

221
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,180
in the Haido Shopping Mall.

222
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,880
Please, go ahead.

223
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,380
Gosh! We are too late.

224
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,880
But it's 30 minutes to noon.

225
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,580
Police. What happened?

226
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,980
The control room of the Ferris Wheel suddenly blew up.

227
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,280
We can't stop the wheel.

228
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,580
We'd like to get the people out of cars, but...

229
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,880
Where is the 72nd car right now?

230
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,480
What?

231
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,080
It's coming down soon.

232
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,480
-Matsuda! -Stop right there!

233
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,080
The knight was not waiting for us,

234
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,480
but there's something beneath the seat.

235
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,380
You don't say... a bomb?

236
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,980
Wait, Matsuda!

237
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,980
I'm all right.

238
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,380
Let a pro handle work like this.

239
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,680
Wait a second, Matsuda!

240
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,380
What does he mean by pro?

241
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,880
He was at the explosives disposal team until last year,

242
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,780
in the Security Task Force.

243
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,580
Then the pal he was talking about that he said had passed away...

244
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:38,380
That's probably his pal Hagiwara of the same team,

245
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,780
who was killed on duty while he was disposing a bomb,

246
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,180
four years ago, on January 6th.

247
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:08,230
In that case, there were two bombs in separate places.

248
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,830
Matsuda disposed of one bomb.

249
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,130
But Hagiwara didn't have enough time.

250
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,430
The bomber has not yet been identified.

251
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:21,030
Matsuda requested transfer to the special team

252
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,530
that is investigating on the bomber.

253
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:27,930
He kept requesting the transfer, but was turned down.

254
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,430
Since they thought he wanted to do things for his pal,

255
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,830
they chose to transfer him, so he could cool off,

256
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,130
and sent him to our section.

257
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,930
Inspector, what shall we do?

258
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,130
It's six minutes to noon.

259
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,130
It'll take the car 10 more minutes to make a round and return.

260
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:49,930
We have no choice but to leave it to Matsuda.

261
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,330
What's that?

262
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,730
It stopped.

263
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,030
Put out the fire quick!

264
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,430
We've got trouble.

265
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:25,430
Hello! Matsuda? Are you all right?

266
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,730
Yeah.

267
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,030
But with the shock just now, and odd switch was turned on.

268
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,130
What?

269
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,730
The mercury lever.

270
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,830
Mercury lever?

271
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,930
A slight shake can make the mercury-drop roll,

272
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,130
and if the drop touches the wire, that's it.

273
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,730
If you don't want to see me blow up,

274
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,530
keep the car still until I dispose of this bomb.

275
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:52,930
But we have less than five minutes until the blow-up.

276
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:57,830
Three minutes would be more than enough for this kind of device.

277
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,430
"To the brave police officer..."

278
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,930
"To the brave police officer.

279
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,530
In praise of your courage, we will give you a prize."

280
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,430
Wait, what are you talking about?

281
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:15,630
"A clue to another bigger firework will be displayed

282
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,930
at 3 seconds before the explosion.

283
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,430
With best wishes."

284
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:25,030
These are the words displayed on the LCD panel right now.

285
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,930
I suppose if we stop the bomb and turn off the power,

286
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,430
we will never be able to read the clue again.

287
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:36,430
That is, the guy intended to put someone into this car

288
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,430
and show these words to him.

289
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,930
Then, that blow-up was turned on

290
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,430
because the guy saw you enter the car.

291
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:48,030
In other words, the bomber is somewhere close by.

292
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:52,630
It's very difficult to identify him out of this crowd of people.

293
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:56,230
But I can guess where he set the other bomb.

294
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,730
You can?

295
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:01,730
The fax says, "the head of our fellow knight."

296
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:05,030
The knights of the round table were from medieval Europe.

297
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:09,230
And those medieval knights wore helmets designed with a cross in front.

298
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,930
It's obvious now, isn't it?

299
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,630
A diagram sign of a hospital?

300
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,030
You guessed right.

301
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:17,330
I'll tell you which hospital it is after I read the clue.

302
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,230
You'll tell me after you read it?

303
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,130
But the clue comes up just 3 seconds before.

304
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:24,130
Well, the battery is almost out.

305
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,330
Bye now.

306
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:29,230
Matsuda...

307
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,430
Matsuda...

308
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:48,530
Allow me for today, will you?

309
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:52,030
Hell, no. There's only one minute left.

310
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,030
Everybody! Get out of here!

311
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,330
What?

312
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,630
Matsuda!

313
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,130
Don't, Sato! It's too late!

314
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,030
But...

315
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,630
Too dangerous! Back off, please!

316
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,930
But he's still there!

317
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,930
He's inside!

318
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,030
"Sending mail"

319
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,930
Sorry, Hagiwara.

320
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,030
I guess I couldn't keep my word.

321
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,730
What?

322
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:45,130
What are we going to do? The fax says there's another bomb.

323
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,830
I know there is!

324
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,930
Beika Central Hospital.

325
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,130
What?

326
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,630
Beika Central Hospital.

327
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,730
The other bomb is there!

328
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,630
Dispatch the bomb disposal squad on the double!

329
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,530
He was like a puff of wind.

330
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,730
"Jimpei Matsuda: Beika Central Hospital."

331
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,630
"I kinda liked you."

332
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,830
He vanished in an instant.

333
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,030
All he left behind is the sad sound.

334
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,630
Officer Sato!

335
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,930
Hey.

336
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:35,130
I didn't know such a thing took place three years ago.

337
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,330
Yes.

338
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:40,230
If Sato still has lingering memories about the incident,

339
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,330
we don't have a chance.

340
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,530
I suppose so.

341
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:49,730
If you want to be like him, you can die on duty.

342
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,130
Hey! Don't say things like that.

343
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,030
Unlucky things may come true, you know.

344
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,230
Wait! It's Sato.

345
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,030
Takagi and Shiratori.

346
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,630
What's the matter?

347
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,130
Conan and the kids are here too.

348
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,730
I just happened to run into them.

349
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,130
Because I am grateful to them for helping out in the case,

350
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:10,030
I'm going to get them sweets or something.

351
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,230
-All the cake we can eat. -Yes.

352
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,930
And, what brings you here?

353
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:17,730
We sort of got a squeal.

354
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,630
We looked through inside this restaurant,

355
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,330
but nothing showed up.

356
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:25,330
It's very likely to be a false lead.

357
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:28,630
Okay, then, I am going to karaoke with Yumi this evening.

358
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,830
Would you guys care to join us?

359
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,530
What? Sure we do.

360
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:35,130
Well, then, you go ahead, Takagi.

361
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,930
I'm not in the mood for singing today.

362
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:41,430
And I guess I'd rather not.

363
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,230
Hey, let's hurry up and go.

364
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,230
-Yeah. -Yes.

365
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:47,230
What kind of squeal was it?

366
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:50,530
Yeah. It was a phone call, a warning,

367
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,530
that a bomb is set up in this restaurant.

368
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,130
Today is January 6th.

369
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:03,030
The same day as the bombing of 7 years ago and 3 years ago.

370
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,430
So, we came and checked.

371
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:08,830
A bomb threat warning, a false lead...

372
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,230
"I am a Major Leaguer, a strong pitcher as well as batter."

373
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,230
"Now, this is the beginning of an extended game."

374
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,330
Don't tell me...

375
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,130
Shiratori!

376
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,180
What's that?

377
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,880
Bombing, again?

378
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,680
Shiratori!

379
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,380
Shiratori!

380
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,980
Shiratori!

381
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,580
It's dangerous.

382
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,380
Get out of here, quickly.

383
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:52,380
Are you all right, Shiratori?

384
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:58,880
Yeah. I couldn't run as you did.

385
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,780
Takagi! Block off this road and get an ambulance.

386
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,580
I will.

387
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:09,080
But he can speak, that means he's okay.

388
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,480
No. He's bleeding at the side of his head,

389
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,780
with paralysis in the left limbs.

390
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,180
This could be...

391
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,780
Accute subdural hemorrhage.

392
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,380
We'd better take him ASAP to the hospital.

393
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,380
He's in critical condition.

394
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,180
Oh, no.

395
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,380
Anyway, if the gas catches fire,

396
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,380
it might cause secondary explosion.

397
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,880
Let's move Inspector Shiratori away from the car

398
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,080
until the ambulance gets here.

399
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,180
Yes, let's do that.

400
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,780
This is terrible. Really terrible.

401
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,580
Yeah. Who on earth would do such a thing?

402
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,580
I don't know the bomber,

403
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,480
but I'm sure that he's after a police officer.

404
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,480
What?

405
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,780
He gave false lead saying that he set up a bomb in the restaurant,

406
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,580
and lured the police into the restaurant.

407
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,180
While the officers were looking for the bomb,

408
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:01,780
he planted the real bomb into the car,

409
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,680
hiding himself among the customers

410
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,680
who were lead out of the restaurant.

411
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,180
From what I saw,

412
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,880
the trigger mechanism seems to work

413
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,980
in a way that the safety pin goes off when the door is first opened.

414
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,580
And when the door is opened again in order to exit,

415
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,180
then it explodes.

416
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,980
The question is,

417
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,380
why did Inspector Shiratori try to get out immediately?

418
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,680
This...

419
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,780
What's that?

420
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,180
I wanted to show this to you as soon as possible.

421
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,880
The memory that you harbor within you and cannot erase...

422
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,480
This is a chance to get rid of it.

423
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,680
"I am a Major Leaguer, a strong pitcher as well as batter.

424
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,180
Now, this is the beginning of an extended game.

425
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:51,080
The game starts at noon tomorrow.

426
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,480
It ends at three in the afternoon.

427
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,180
No use getting ready a good stopper.

428
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,480
Because I will win in the end.

429
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,380
And if you want to stop the game, come to me.

430
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,080
I will be waiting for you

431
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:11,380
to climb up the bloody mound in the steel batter's box."

432
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,180
What?

433
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,480
It's...

434
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,380
Hey.

435
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,880
Could it be...

436
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,680
This is...

437
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,880
I am a knight of the round table.

438
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,980
Let the foolish, cunning police know that...

439
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,280
Let a pro handle work like this.

440
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,980
It's him.

441
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,880
It's him again.

442
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,180
Really?

443
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,680
Did Shiratori get involved in an explosion?

444
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,880
Yes, sir.

445
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,780
He was taken by an ambulance to a nearby hospital just now.

446
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,280
He has been seriously injured.

447
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,180
What is the situation over there, sir?

448
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:08,080
The same fax with the same words you just told me.

449
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,780
The same faxes have been sent to

450
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,680
all the police stations in the metropolitan district.

451
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,080
They are all upset over the fax.

452
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,780
There's a possibility that it is the same one

453
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,280
responsible for the bombings 7 years ago and 3 years ago.

454
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,780
No doubt about it. It's from the bomber.

455
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,180
Please tell Director Matsumoto about it, sir.

456
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,180
In the incident of three years ago,

457
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,280
only the first portion of the warning notice

458
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,180
was released to the public.

459
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,380
An imitator couldn't have made up such a detailed warning notice.

460
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:41,080
Sato, I brought your car here.

461
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,980
Thanks, Chiba.

462
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,880
Now, I will go join the investigation team, sir.

463
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,480
Hey, Sato! Sato!

464
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,680
He's not getting away. Not this time.

465
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,180
I'll take him in myself.

466
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,820
Emergency, emergency.

467
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,820
From MPD to all stations.

468
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,220
We haven't specified where yet,

469
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,120
but we received a bomb threat warning.

470
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,620
There are two bombs.

471
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:17,520
Time of explosion is at noon tomorrow and at 15:00 the same day.

472
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,320
As the past incidents show, this warning is very credible.

473
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,220
Keep strict watch and be on the alert.

474
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,520
Continue investigation and don't let the suspect get away.

475
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,620
Extended game?

476
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,420
He's toying with us.

477
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,320
-Megure! -Yes, sir.

478
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,020
No extension is allowed.

479
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:41,320
Settle the case once and for all, understand?

480
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,820
I'll do my best, sir.

481
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,220
It's your chance to...

482
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:53,020
The memory that you harbor within you and cannot erase...

483
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,120
This is a chance to get rid of it.

484
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,020
Yes. I have to get rid of.

485
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,520
I've got to arrest the bomber and forget about the past.

486
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,920
Forget?

487
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,020
Keepsakes of your father who died on duty,

488
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,220
and you wear it as a charm.

489
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,520
Give it back to me!

490
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,020
I know what you want to say to me,

491
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,220
throw it away to go on forward, forget about it.

492
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:22,120
No. You don't have to forget.

493
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,620
What?

494
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:27,220
Whether you move on forward or not depends on you.

495
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:31,820
If you forget him completely, your father will be really gone.

496
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,320
Matsuda.

497
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,120
Matsuda.

498
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,720
Will you tell me something?

499
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,820
Why does this bomber hold a grudge against the police?

500
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,420
Conan!

501
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,320
When did you get in the car?

502
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,620
Tell me, please.

503
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,420
In the bombing incident of 7 years ago,

504
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,620
there were two bombers.

505
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,520
They planted the bombs in two separate condominiums.

506
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,620
They demanded a billion yen,

507
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,720
and said that they will blow the bomb up

508
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,920
if even one resident escapes from the condo.

509
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,620
We disposed of one bomb in time

510
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,820
but failed with the other.

511
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,720
We had to accept their demand.

512
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,520
They stopped the time counter

513
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,320
for triggering the bomb through their remote controller.

514
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,520
All the residents evacuated

515
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,020
and it seemed as if all was over.

516
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:40,120
But 30 minutes later, one of the bombers calls the police.

517
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,720
He said, "The timer is still counting down, what's going on?"

518
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,220
He probably made the mistake of watching the TV news

519
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,220
and reviewing what happened through VCR.

520
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,520
The police thought it a good chance to secure the bomber.

521
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,220
They talked him into conversation and succeeded in tracing his phone call.

522
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,820
We found the bomber in a telephone booth.

523
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,820
But unfortunately...

524
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:16,620
The bomber fled and was run over by a car and killed.

525
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:24,120
Then, how did you figure out there was the other bomber?

526
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,420
It's because...

527
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,720
Later, the timer that was supposed to stop counting

528
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,420
started counting again and the bomb blew up.

529
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,920
Run, everybody!

530
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,520
The timer started counting again!

531
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,920
We found the address of the bomber who was killed.

532
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,720
But all we found out was that he was living there with another guy.

533
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,720
The other bomber probably thought

534
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,520
the police gave false information through TV

535
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,020
and set a trap, which killed his pal.

536
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,320
They're blaming their faults on the wrong people.

537
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,220
It's their fault, because they set the bomb

538
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,120
and tried to get the money in the first place.

539
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,620
That's right.

540
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,720
You heard me, it's time to get off now.

541
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,220
We're going to help you.

542
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,720
The more the merrier.

543
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,820
Well, but if they find out

544
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,820
I'm making investigations with kids in my car...

545
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,920
Well, kids have more advantage

546
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,820
in solving this kind of childish codes.

547
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:40,420
Or, is it that you're not satisfied having just us

548
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,220
and Conan not around?

549
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,120
Not satisfied?

550
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,020
No, that's not it.

551
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,320
But, why did the bomber go out of his way

552
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,520
to send the coded note to the police?

553
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,220
If he didn't do anything, he wouldn't be caught.

554
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,420
Suppose you hide a treasure

555
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:03,120
and somebody comes trying to find it, what would you do?

556
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,320
I'll be watching him with my heart beating fast.

557
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,720
Suppose you hide the treasure in a pitfall with a trap?

558
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,820
Then of course, we will...

559
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,020
We'll give them clues little by little.

560
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,720
That's it! That's why he's started to give clues.

561
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,220
You're right. The bomber's acting like a child,

562
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,420
playing with a toy called the bomb.

563
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,120
He's a wicked brat with a wicked toy in his hands.

564
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:57,430
Hey, Ran! Telephone!

565
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:00,430
Gosh. Dad, answer the phone, will you?

566
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:04,130
Both my hands are full, so I can't pick up the phone.

567
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,830
Gosh.

568
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,530
Hello. This is Mouri.

569
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,230
It's me.

570
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,630
Dr. Agasa!

571
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:17,030
Ran, it's about Conan.

572
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:19,930
He insists on staying here tonight.

573
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:22,630
What? At your place, Dr. Agasa?

574
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:25,230
Yes. The kids really liked the game I made

575
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,730
and they just can't quit.

576
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:30,330
Are Ayumi and the others there, too?

577
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,930
That's right.

578
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,430
The Winter holidays will be over,

579
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:37,030
so they will be back by tomorrow evening.

580
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,030
But...

581
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:40,430
Well then, goodbye.

582
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:45,330
Ayumi's home next.

583
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,230
Please, Doc.

584
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,330
We want to get back at the bomber for what he did to Inspector Shiratori.

585
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,230
Right, right!

586
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,830
Please, Dr. Agasa.

587
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,030
I'll make sure to keep them out of danger, Doctor.

588
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:01,430
Gosh. I'll be in trouble if anyone finds out.

589
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:06,730
And I cooked Conan's favorite dish.

590
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,530
That's good, you know.

591
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:11,330
You're taking the national test tomorrow, aren't you?

592
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:12,630
You don't have to take care of the kids,

593
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:16,230
so you can prepare yourself for the test.

594
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:20,230
By the way, Ran, I'd like another bottle, please.

595
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,530
What? You are going to drink more?

596
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:25,530
It won't hurt, will it?

597
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:28,930
It's more of hassle taking care of a drunkard.

598
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:36,530
What does this note mean?

599
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:40,030
The only thing we're sure of is the time.

600
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:43,030
Anyway, the guy's a foreigner.

601
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,230
He's a major league baseball player.

602
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,230
Not exactly a foreigner.

603
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:50,730
There are Japanese major league players too now a days.

604
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,530
That's right.

605
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:57,330
But he set bomb to a baseball ground somewhere, I'm sure.

606
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:02,230
Yeah. It says "mound" and "Batter's box".

607
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,930
It's South Haido station.

608
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,930
You mean, South Haido station?

609
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,530
Of Toto Central Line?

610
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,630
That's right.

611
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,230
What are you talking about?

612
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:14,330
There's no baseball ground near South Haido Station.

613
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,130
It's a code.

614
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:20,730
It isn't literally referring to a mound or batter's box.

615
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:23,930
So, you mean you deciphered the code?

616
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,230
Yes.

617
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:28,830
Three years ago, bombs were set to

618
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,630
the Big Ferris Wheel of the Haido Shopping Mall

619
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:34,030
and the Beika Central Hospital.

620
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,930
South Haido Station of the Touto Chuo Line

621
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:41,930
is located where the roads facing the two places.

622
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:47,530
But that's just a play on words extended game and extended lines.

623
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:48,930
Slow, aren't you?

624
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,930
If a station is located where the roads intersect,

625
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:55,330
there would most naturally be a stopper there, right?

626
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,630
A stopper?

627
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,830
Stopper?

628
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:59,230
What's that?

629
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,230
I see! I got it!

630
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,230
What?

631
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:05,130
The crossing bar of a railroad crossing, isn't it?

632
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:09,430
Then, the steel batter's box could be...

633
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:12,730
Box of steel, or the car of the train.

634
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:15,930
And, to go climb the bloody mound,

635
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:18,330
could mean a red colored train that goes up to the center of the city.

636
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:22,330
Good heavens! I have to let Sato know about this.

637
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:25,030
It's all right. I heard you.

638
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:27,530
We virtually agree.

639
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:31,530
One bomb will be set up on the Toto Central Line train

640
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:34,930
that goes from South Haido Station to Tokyo.

641
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:38,530
I will contact the Inspector to dispatch investigators.

642
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:41,330
And Takagi, you arrange for the bomb disposal squad.

643
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:43,430
-Hurry! -Yes, right away.

644
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,530
What? South Haido Station?

645
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:47,930
Really?

646
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:52,130
Yes. And then?

647
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,630
Okay, I see.

648
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,930
We will arrange for it immediately.

649
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,930
Everybody, please evacuate calmly!

650
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:15,730
What? It's just trash.

651
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,630
What's this?

652
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,330
This... this is...

653
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:21,330
A bomb?

654
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:24,430
Get off, everybody. It's a bomb!

655
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,130
What?

656
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,630
What the heck is this?

657
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,930
What? False?

658
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:40,130
It wasn't a real bomb, you say?

659
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,230
And then?

660
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,930
I guess the bomber expected

661
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:46,530
the investigators go there to search.

662
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:51,430
Right. He is a smart-aleck mischievous brat, I guess.

663
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:55,830
-Besides, he's not after money. -Yes.

664
00:39:55,830 --> 00:40:00,630
Yeah. The guy probably just has a grudge against the police,

665
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:06,730
and is holding hostage 12 million people who live in the city of Tokyo.

666
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:20,870
"Tohto Line, South Haido Station"

667
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,770
"Fail"

668
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:51,270
What? False bomb again?

669
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:53,670
Did you check all of them?

670
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:56,370
Is there no real bomb?

671
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,570
No, sir.

672
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:02,870
We have checked all the red trains that go through the city,

673
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:07,270
but all the suspicious ones have been false or pranks.

674
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,770
I see.

675
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:12,770
The bomber's probably trying to throw off our investigation.

676
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,570
Anyway, be patient and continue your investigations.

677
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,070
Yes, sir.

678
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,570
Director Matsumoto.

679
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:19,570
What is it?

680
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:22,970
Report from the Ozaki team, sir. They are at the ballparks.

681
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:25,170
-And, what did you get? -Yes, sir.

682
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:29,770
They have finished checking all the major ballparks in the city

683
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,170
but nothing came up so far.

684
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:37,270
They say they will continue investigation covering smaller ballparks.

685
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:42,470
We don't have to check the ballpark anymore, I guess.

686
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:46,670
All right. Stop all the red trains in the city.

687
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,770
Get all the investigators out of the ballparks

688
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:51,370
and dispatch them to all the stations to conduct investigations.

689
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:53,770
We still have five more hours

690
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:55,670
till the first explosion expected to go off at noon.

691
00:41:55,670 --> 00:42:00,070
He can outfox us and try setting up a bomb from now.

692
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:01,370
Yes, sir!

693
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:10,170
Five more hours, huh?

694
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:15,570
I wanted to say we have only five hours left for us.

695
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:16,870
Yes.

696
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:29,270
I'm sleepy.

697
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,570
Isn't it strange?

698
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:38,970
From this note, you would think that

699
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:41,970
he expected somebody to come kooking for it to the ballpark,

700
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,570
but nothing happened.

701
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:48,270
He thought nobody would come.

702
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:51,670
It's off-season and no big game is scheduled.

703
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,170
Oh, yeah?

704
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,070
If he wanted to play pranks on the police,

705
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:59,870
he could have set a false trap or two.

706
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:03,870
At any rate, we can't keep those kids with us anymore.

707
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:06,670
You're right.

708
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:10,170
By the way, how is Shiratori? Did you ask how he is?

709
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,970
Yes, I did.

710
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:15,770
Yumi is taking care of Shiratori,

711
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,470
and she told me that the operation was successful.

712
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:20,870
They are waiting for him to regain consciousness.

713
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:23,570
That's good. I'm relieved.

714
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,470
Listen here, Takagi.

715
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:31,070
Make sure Miwako stays out of dangerous situations.

716
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:33,070
If the bomber is the same bomber

717
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:36,570
that killed Matsuda with a bomb,

718
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:38,870
who knows what she might do

719
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:42,670
and there will be no one but you who will be able to save her.

720
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:46,470
What? Why me?

721
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:51,270
You're so much like Mr. Matsuda.

722
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:55,270
But that's only because I happened to be disguised like him.

723
00:43:55,270 --> 00:44:00,370
Of course, he's five to ten times better in looks or attitude.

724
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:02,670
Ten times, is it?

725
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:05,170
But something about you reminds me of him.

726
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:08,570
It may be your heart, feelings or whatever...

727
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:11,270
Something resembles Matsuda.

728
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:15,370
I guess Miwako came to realize that lately.

729
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:16,870
Hey, Takagi.

730
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:19,770
Takagi!

731
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:22,970
What were you thinking over so seriously?

732
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:26,170
Did you find out where the bomb is?

733
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,870
No, I didn't.

734
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,170
Then, what?

735
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:32,470
It's nothing important.

736
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:34,870
Okay, for now.

737
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:42,370
I'll continue the investigation.

738
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:45,570
You send the kids home.

739
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:48,670
Then you return to the MPD to get some sleep

740
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:51,270
and stay there to help Inspector Megure.

741
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:53,270
But I can keep investigating.

742
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:56,770
Don't be silly. An officer who is unsteady from lack of sleep

743
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:59,470
will only get in the way of the investigation. Got it?

744
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:02,770
Yes.

745
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:09,170
No.

746
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:11,170
I won't let you take him from me.

747
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:14,770
Not anymore.

748
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:16,070
Never.

749
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:26,670
Taking a test right after new year holidays

750
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:29,170
makes me feel like I'm living a gray life of a prep.

751
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:30,170
Yeah.

752
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:32,770
New year days are meant for everyone to enjoy!

753
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:34,870
So, you enjoyed yourself, didn't you?

754
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:36,970
Sure. I didn't want to regret not doing what I wanted to do.

755
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:42,570
Well, only thing I can depend on is this.

756
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:46,070
What? Isn't it... Could that be...

757
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:48,870
No.

758
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:49,870
Look!

759
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:55,170
Gosh. It's the photo of Kyogoku.

760
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:59,270
Yeah. This photo gives me energy when I look at it.

761
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:01,970
Even if my test results aren't good,

762
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:04,470
I won't get depressed.

763
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,970
As long as I have Makoto's love,

764
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:09,370
I don't need to score 100 on my test.

765
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:12,570
Oh, I'm so ashamed of myself for being so bold!

766
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:14,170
Sure, sure.

767
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:25,970
"I have stolen your sleeping face."

768
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:38,370
Okay, kids. I'll take you home.

769
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:41,070
Tell me where you live, will you?

770
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:42,170
What?

771
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:44,870
Are you taking us back home?

772
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:48,570
We may be able to solve this code in a moment.

773
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:51,070
You haven't slept for a long time.

774
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:56,570
I can't keep you, school kids, with me any longer.

775
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:57,570
What?

776
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:03,870
Say! Where's Officer Sato?

777
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:06,170
She's investigating on the case.

778
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:11,170
I see. Officer Sato told you to send us home.

779
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,770
You do everything she tells you to do, don't you?

780
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:18,770
I have to. She's two years older and my senior as well.

781
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:21,670
And you think you'll do fine after marrying her, too?

782
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:23,270
Marry her?

783
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:28,070
I won't be. Because she just dumped me the other day.

784
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:31,670
Sato.

785
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:33,270
Yes?

786
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:36,270
You said you have something to say to me.

787
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:39,370
Oh, that.

788
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:44,870
Sato.

789
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:50,870
Let's forget about the date. The date we were gonna have.

790
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:51,870
What?

791
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:53,870
I'm cursed.

792
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:56,370
Cursed?

793
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:59,570
All the people that I care dearly for,

794
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:02,470
seem to disappear from me.

795
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:07,070
My father, the P.E. teacher in school,

796
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:09,870
my senior in the baseball club,

797
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:11,270
and...

798
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:17,070
him too.

799
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:25,370
I don't want to have to go through that kind of pain anymore.

800
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:26,670
Sato.

801
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:30,170
We have been good friends and police officers,

802
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:32,370
and I want us to stay that way right through.

803
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:37,770
Sato.

804
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:40,970
Takagi.

805
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:46,170
Yes...

806
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:51,070
You're right. We are not well-matched in the first place.

807
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:56,070
Yeah, you deserve a prettier cuter girl.

808
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:57,670
Really?

809
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:02,170
See? I'm not getting married.

810
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:04,370
So you gave her up?

811
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:06,370
What a chicken!

812
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:08,170
No guts at all.

813
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:11,870
I don't want to give her up, but...

814
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:14,570
But what?

815
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:17,070
But...

816
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:22,570
Officer Matsuda risked his life to save the people in the hospital,

817
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:25,870
but I can't be his equal. Right?

818
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:27,170
Where did you learn that?

819
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:29,670
Officer Takagi. Ahead! Look ahead!

820
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:33,170
We heard about it from the lady on the mini-patrol car.

821
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,170
You mean Yumi?

822
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:37,070
She told us in detail.

823
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:40,270
Then, Officer Matsuda decided at that time

824
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:45,170
to risk his life to tell us where the other bomb was planted.

825
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:47,070
Yes, yes.

826
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:51,670
Well, time's up. I have to hang up now.

827
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:53,870
Wait, Matsuda!

828
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:56,570
Matsuda...

829
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:03,870
You can't listen to it or tell it without tears.

830
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:05,370
Yeah.

831
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,470
Oh, yeah?

832
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:11,370
I wouldn't blame you for giving up.

833
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:17,470
The memory of one who's gone is sealed

834
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:21,370
and will be kept in the heart for a life time.

835
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:22,970
Like someone I know.

836
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:26,370
Hey! I'm not dead yet.

837
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:39,670
How did you do on the math test?

838
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:42,270
Bummers.

839
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:48,470
Unlike you, I have nobody to help me in my difficulties.

840
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:49,770
Help me?

841
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:51,670
You can't fool me, Ran.

842
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:57,270
You were often looking at Shinichi's desk for the right answers.

843
00:50:57,270 --> 00:50:59,070
"Help, Shinichi!

844
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:03,770
I have trouble solving this derivative, integral problem."

845
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:04,770
Be honest about it.

846
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,870
No, you're wrong! I looked at Shinichi's desk because...

847
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:09,970
Because? Keep on!

848
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:12,170
Because...

849
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:24,270
You're blushing crimson.

850
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:27,170
Red is a sinister color during test time.

851
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:28,170
Speaking of red,

852
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:31,670
there has been so many police sirens since this morning.

853
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,670
True. You're right.

854
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,970
What's happened?

855
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:45,670
Red, red...

856
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:47,270
What's the matter with red?

857
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,270
Something does not fit.

858
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:52,370
This "climb up the bloody mound" means.

859
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:55,170
You mean that it's not a red train?

860
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:59,070
It's kind of... not right.

861
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:03,170
Now, wait. If it's like the case 3 years before,

862
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:04,570
the first bomb is set in a place

863
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:08,870
that's rather easy for the police to find.

864
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:12,170
I have to think more simply.

865
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,570
The simpler the better.

866
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:17,570
Something that reminds you of red?

867
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:19,770
Mailboxes, fire engines...

868
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:22,170
Red demon, little red riding hood...

869
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:26,570
Tomato, strawberries, watermelon, apple,

870
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:30,470
cherries, hot chili pepper, red salmon and red lobsters...

871
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:35,470
Red... climb... steel... box...

872
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:38,170
Genta, you only think about food.

873
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:41,170
I've used up my brain, now I'm hungry.

874
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:43,870
I'm kinda thirsty.

875
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:48,170
Well, then we can go and stop at some parking area.

876
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:52,570
Red, you say. There's another red over there.

877
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:54,770
Look, you can see it over there.

878
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:56,370
Yeah.

879
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,570
I see.

880
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:06,170
Red, climb up, box of steel...

881
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:18,910
"Toto Tower"

882
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:26,110
Is something already happening?

883
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:27,710
What is it?

884
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:29,310
There's smoke coming out.

885
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:33,810
I wonder if a bomb was set up here after all.

886
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:37,110
I'll go ask what happened,

887
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:39,910
so you kids wait in the car.

888
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:41,110
Okay?

889
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:47,010
We were scheduled to bring you

890
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:49,910
a special on Toto Towers mascot Toto today,

891
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:52,010
but due to an accident,

892
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:54,810
we have inevitably changed the schedule.

893
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:58,010
Excuse me. What on earth has happened?

894
00:53:58,010 --> 00:53:59,510
You see, the thing is...

895
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:03,110
What? The bomb is inside Toto Tower?

896
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:05,610
Yes, I'm pretty sure.

897
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:08,110
Just what do you mean? Tell me about it in detail, will you?

898
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:13,310
Yes. Just before I got here, there was a small explosion,

899
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:15,810
and the elevator seems to have stopped.

900
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:17,710
-What? -It's most likely that

901
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:20,410
the suspect thinking that the police located the bomb,

902
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:23,610
used a remote control to set off the explosion.

903
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:29,010
The control room of the Ferris Wheel suddenly blew up.

904
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:31,110
We can't stop the wheel.

905
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:35,510
It's the same as back then.

906
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:40,810
I'll go over to the elevator that had stopped and check things out.

907
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:41,910
No!

908
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:45,610
That bomb has been set to lure officers there. It's a trap!

909
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:48,910
What? A trap?

910
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:52,510
I'll be there in 5 minutes, so wait there until I get there.

911
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:53,710
Understand?

912
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:55,110
Okay.

913
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:57,310
Hey, we've got trouble!

914
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:01,610
It seems that a girl's been trapped in the elevator that stopped

915
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:03,810
because of the explosion a while ago.

916
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:05,710
What?

917
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:09,110
Officer Sato, a child is in the elevator.

918
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:10,410
Calm down.

919
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:13,610
We've still got two hours to go before the predicted time of bombing.

920
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:18,310
But I'd better go and check things out as soon as possible.

921
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:19,610
Don't worry.

922
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:22,910
I'll work something out, so you just stay there.

923
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:24,610
But...

924
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:26,410
Listen here, Takagi.

925
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:29,210
Make sure Miwako stays out of dangerous situations.

926
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:32,110
I'll rescue that girl. I promise!

927
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:33,310
But...

928
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:36,310
Who knows what she might do later.

929
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:38,610
Understand? This is an order!

930
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:42,010
You stay there until I get there.

931
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:43,610
Understand, Officer Takagi?

932
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:47,910
Hey, Officer Takagi. Can you hear me?

933
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:50,610
Officer Takagi, answer me!

934
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:52,310
Hey, Officer Takagi!

935
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:54,310
Officer Takagi!

936
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:56,710
Please, Officer Takagi! Don't go!

937
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:01,910
I'm going.

938
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:09,410
I'm going to check how things are inside.

939
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:11,410
Officer Takagi!

940
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:16,510
All of you!

941
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:20,310
I'm going to go inside the tower now,

942
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:23,110
so you all stay still and wait here, okay?

943
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:24,410
What?

944
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:26,210
Understand?

945
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:27,810
Yes, sir.

946
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:29,710
I'll be right back!

947
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:33,510
I wonder if Officer Takagi is going to be okay.

948
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:37,510
-Ai, take care of everybody, okay? -What?

949
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:41,210
-Hey, Conan! -Conan!

950
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:43,810
What? Are you going too, Conan?

951
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:47,010
I'm just going to go check how things are.

952
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:50,110
You guys keep watch and make sure nobody suspicious

953
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:51,410
comes near this car.

954
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:52,810
But...

955
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:56,810
We'll be in big trouble if a bomb is set up on this car again, right?

956
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:59,710
But I know you guys, the Youth Detective Squad,

957
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:02,110
will be able to take care of things even if I'm not around, right?

958
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:03,710
Well, I guess.

959
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:05,210
Leave it to us.

960
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:06,810
See you!

961
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:08,510
Be careful, Conan!

962
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:19,710
According to the report from Officer Takagi,

963
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:21,010
about 15 minutes ago,

964
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:26,210
there was a small explosion near the special observatory area.

965
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:30,810
It seems that one elevator of this observatory is stalled.

966
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:34,110
Only it hasn't been confirmed whether this explosion

967
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:37,310
was due to a bomb or an accident.

968
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:42,510
It much too resembles the case of 3 years ago to be an accident.

969
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:44,310
True.

970
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:46,710
There's probably no doubt about it.

971
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:50,410
Emergency, emergency!

972
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:52,210
From MPD to all stations.

973
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:53,810
There is a high possibility that

974
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:56,510
a bomb has been set at Toto Towers in Minato Ward.

975
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:59,310
Head to the site on the double

976
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,310
and block off the entrance to Toto Tower.

977
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:04,710
Secure an evacuation site for the citizens in the vicinity.

978
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:07,710
Officer Takagi.

979
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:11,610
Emergency announcement to all visitors.

980
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:16,310
We are very sorry to announce that we will be closing for the day.

981
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:18,610
Please follow the instructions of the guide

982
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:21,110
and leave the tower immediately.

983
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:25,110
Please remain calm, and move along without rushing.

984
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:28,010
Excuse me, police. Please let me through!

985
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:30,110
Please don't panic.

986
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:34,210
Police! Where's the elevator that stopped?

987
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:36,710
It's the one at the very end.

988
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:38,510
Thanks.

989
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:41,610
Akemi, you'll be fine. Don't be afraid. Come on out.

990
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:43,210
Police.

991
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:46,510
This is the elevator that the girl is trap in?

992
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:47,910
Yes, sir.

993
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:49,510
-It came down from the top floor... -Akemi...

994
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:53,710
and stopped just before reaching the observatory.

995
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:56,710
Akemi. What are you doing, Akemi?

996
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:59,510
Hurry and come out! Come over here!

997
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:01,010
Akemi!

998
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:03,510
Only one child was in the elevator

999
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:05,810
but she's so scared that she won't listen to her mother

1000
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:08,210
telling her to come out.

1001
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:11,810
This space is too small for an adult to get through.

1002
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:13,610
Will you carry me up then?

1003
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:14,810
What?

1004
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:16,910
I can make it inside, can't I?

1005
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:18,810
Conan.

1006
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:23,810
We continue to bring you live broadcast news from Toto Tower.

1007
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:27,110
Today, at approximately 9:45 a.m.,

1008
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:29,310
there was an explosion inside Toto Tower.

1009
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:31,110
The cause of the explosion is still unknown.

1010
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:33,910
Fortunately, no casualties have been reported,

1011
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:35,310
but due to the impact of the explosion,

1012
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:38,510
one of the elevators have stopped.

1013
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:41,610
A four years old girl who happened to be on the elevator

1014
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:43,510
is trapped inside.

1015
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:47,210
Presently, while trying to find the cause of the explosion...

1016
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:05,610
Conan, are you all right?

1017
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:06,910
Yes.

1018
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:09,610
Hello, Akemi.

1019
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:15,810
I'm going to go over to you now, so hold on, okay?

1020
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:23,610
Akemi, what a cute teddy bear.

1021
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:25,610
What's its name?

1022
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:29,110
Jam.

1023
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:32,410
What a cute name! Is he a boy?

1024
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:34,310
Yes.

1025
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:38,910
I want to go over and say hello to Jam.

1026
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:40,210
Is it okay?

1027
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:41,710
Yes, it's okay.

1028
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:43,510
I'm going over there, okay?

1029
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:47,610
We just got a report that

1030
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:50,610
a police officer went into the elevator

1031
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:54,110
to rescue the girl that is trapped inside.

1032
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:58,010
What? A child went into the elevator?

1033
01:00:58,010 --> 01:00:59,610
It can't be!

1034
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:08,010
And mommy bought me Jam for my birthday.

1035
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:12,210
I see. Since mommy's waiting outside, shall we go?

1036
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,410
Yes.

1037
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:24,610
Okay, come. Good girl.

1038
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:28,010
-Mommy! -Akemi!

1039
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:29,310
Mommy!

1040
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:30,810
-Akemi! -Mommy!

1041
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:32,510
Akemi!

1042
01:01:36,510 --> 01:01:38,910
-Okay, Conan, now you. -Yes!

1043
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:49,710
Conan!

1044
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:53,010
Gosh!

1045
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:06,310
And? You went off wanting to look cool,

1046
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:09,610
and now you're trapped in the elevator with Conan.

1047
01:02:09,610 --> 01:02:11,910
I'm sorry.

1048
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:17,110
By the way, are you sure there's no bomb in that elevator?

1049
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:22,510
No, there's nothing that looks like a bomb here in the elevator.

1050
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:25,610
I'm going check the top of the elevator now.

1051
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:40,710
Do you know about where you are now?

1052
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:42,410
Probably...

1053
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:44,610
All the wires seem to have been severed,

1054
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:47,210
so I think with the emergency stop

1055
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:52,210
we are in the middle of the observatory and roof of the tower building.

1056
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:53,210
Is that right?

1057
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:55,810
I guess I'll have to climb to the ceiling

1058
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:58,110
and wait for the rescue squad.

1059
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:00,210
No, don't climb up to the ceiling!

1060
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:02,810
The mercury lever will operate!

1061
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:05,510
The mercury lever?

1062
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:07,110
Mercury lever?

1063
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:11,310
A slight shake can make the mercury-drop roll,

1064
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:13,410
and if the drop touches the wire, that's it.

1065
01:03:14,410 --> 01:03:18,310
Conan, what's a mercury lever?

1066
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:21,110
It's a part of the trigger device of the bomb.

1067
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:23,310
It's a bomb big enough that is capable of

1068
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:25,810
not only blowing up this elevator

1069
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:27,710
but the entire Toto Tower as well.

1070
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:42,030
A bomb?

1071
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:44,730
On the ceiling of this elevator?

1072
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:48,430
Are you sure about that, Conan?

1073
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:53,830
Yes. I saw bombs that looks just like this one on TV.

1074
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,930
I heard that if it's just one type of liquid it's okay,

1075
01:03:56,930 --> 01:03:58,330
but when it mixes with the other liquid,

1076
01:03:58,330 --> 01:04:00,930
it turns into a very strong bomb.

1077
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:03,030
Then, wouldn't it be more the reason

1078
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:05,930
to have the rescue squad come here?

1079
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:10,030
I just said that the mercury lever is set, didn't I?

1080
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:12,930
It's most likely that the switch went on

1081
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:14,830
with the impact of the elevator stopping just a while ago.

1082
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:18,730
The switch of the trigger device

1083
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:21,530
that will go off with the slightest shake.

1084
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:25,230
So if you climb up to this roof

1085
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:27,530
or if the rescue squad comes down here with a rope,

1086
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,830
the minute they set foot on the ground

1087
01:04:29,830 --> 01:04:33,530
and even if it shakes just a little bit, it's boom!

1088
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:38,130
Is it that strong?

1089
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:39,930
The mercury lever.

1090
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:43,830
Mercury lever...

1091
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:47,130
Just as I thought.

1092
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:48,630
I'm sure that the one who set this up

1093
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:51,130
is the same bomber as three years ago.

1094
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:57,930
Then, don't tell me that...

1095
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:03,530
Then, why don't we have them lower a rope from the elevator door above

1096
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:05,530
and we both climb and escape?

1097
01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:07,930
I don't think that will work either.

1098
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:09,130
What?

1099
01:05:09,130 --> 01:05:13,730
There's wire tap near the bomb.

1100
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:16,230
So, I'm sure that as soon as the bomber

1101
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:18,630
is listening to our conversation from somewhere.

1102
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:21,930
And the minute we leave here and he stops hearing our conversation,

1103
01:05:21,930 --> 01:05:24,830
he's planning to turn on the switch and set the bomb off.

1104
01:05:24,830 --> 01:05:28,730
Which means we're trapped either way.

1105
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:31,330
No, we still have one way out.

1106
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:37,630
I have to disassemble this bomb.

1107
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:41,030
I need them to lower the bomb disposal tool from above though.

1108
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:45,930
I repeat.

1109
01:05:45,930 --> 01:05:48,030
All citizens within the vicinity of Toto Tower,

1110
01:05:48,030 --> 01:05:52,430
please follow the instructions of the police and evacuate to safety.

1111
01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:55,430
-What? -Are we running away?

1112
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:59,430
Conan and Officer Takagi are still in there.

1113
01:05:59,430 --> 01:06:02,130
No need to worry,

1114
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:05,830
because those two are probably heading this way already.

1115
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:09,330
Officer Chiba, please take the children to a safe place.

1116
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:11,530
Okay.

1117
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:15,230
The two are going to dispose of the bomb.

1118
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:17,230
What?

1119
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:19,530
The bomb disposal squad is not even going into the tower

1120
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:23,230
and are waiting for communication,

1121
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:25,530
so that's what it means, right?

1122
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:27,330
They'll be okay.

1123
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:29,630
The composition of the bomb is virtually the same as

1124
01:06:29,630 --> 01:06:34,230
the one that was set up in Beika Central Hospital 3 years ago,

1125
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:37,130
so those two will somehow work something out.

1126
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:39,030
Yes, I guess so.

1127
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:42,030
As long as they don't lend an ear

1128
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:44,830
to the voice of the devil, like 3 years ago...

1129
01:06:48,530 --> 01:06:50,730
Let it down slowly.

1130
01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:53,430
Easy now, easy.

1131
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:55,730
All right...

1132
01:06:58,730 --> 01:07:00,030
Are you all right?

1133
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:01,930
Okay, I got it!

1134
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:05,230
Roger!

1135
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:08,230
We've completed giving the equipment.

1136
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:09,530
Okay.

1137
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:13,430
Okay, Officer Takagi, let's start.

1138
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:14,730
Yes, sir.

1139
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:16,330
You idiot!

1140
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:19,330
Shape up and stop panicking!

1141
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:23,130
The one who's going to do the actual work is the boy that is with you!

1142
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:26,130
If you get flustered, you may make the boy anxious

1143
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:27,930
and that may call for careless mistakes!

1144
01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:29,130
Yes, sir.

1145
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:30,630
Don't worry.

1146
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:32,830
If you take it easy and follow our instructions,

1147
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:34,230
it'll finish in no time at all.

1148
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:35,930
Calm down!

1149
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:37,230
I understand.

1150
01:07:37,230 --> 01:07:39,630
Okay. First of all,

1151
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:41,930
let's start by removing the photosensitive trigger device.

1152
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:43,230
Yes, sir.

1153
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:47,130
We will turn off the elevator lights in a minute from now,

1154
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:49,530
so put on the infrared night scope.

1155
01:07:51,930 --> 01:07:56,630
When it gets dark, remove the mercury lever's right side cover.

1156
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:59,330
Be careful not to touch the mercury lever.

1157
01:07:59,330 --> 01:08:02,930
First, we remove the cover, right?

1158
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:06,030
Right. We'll turn off the lights now.

1159
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:09,730
Did you get that, Conan?

1160
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:14,930
Conan?

1161
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:17,630
Here it is. The light sensitive tube.

1162
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:20,230
If I cut the cord...

1163
01:08:22,930 --> 01:08:25,330
What a relief.

1164
01:08:25,330 --> 01:08:27,530
Conan, can you hear me?

1165
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:30,630
Yes! I can hear you, so keep on going.

1166
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:32,630
Yeah.

1167
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:34,030
Let's see.

1168
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:37,530
If you take off the cover, you can see a lot of machines, right?

1169
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:41,330
Just above those machines, you should see a device that moves

1170
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:44,830
when it detects light called a light sensitive tube.

1171
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:47,230
First of all, cut the cord

1172
01:08:47,230 --> 01:08:48,730
that is sticking out of the light sensitive tube.

1173
01:08:48,730 --> 01:08:50,830
Then, I turn this...

1174
01:08:53,530 --> 01:08:55,930
Electricity's flowing!

1175
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:58,030
Watch out, watch out.

1176
01:08:58,030 --> 01:09:00,330
Okay, then. I'll place the plastic plate in this space

1177
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:03,230
and use it as a stopper.

1178
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:05,130
Stopper?

1179
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:07,830
Come to think of it, that code...

1180
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:11,630
"No use getting ready a good stopper", that's what it said.

1181
01:09:12,730 --> 01:09:16,730
Good stopper probably means earned run average.

1182
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:22,130
But, why a major leaguer?

1183
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:24,030
This is Japan.

1184
01:09:24,030 --> 01:09:26,430
He could've just written pro baseball player.

1185
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:30,330
Wait a sec.

1186
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:34,330
Extended game... earned run average...

1187
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:37,330
Turn over... Major Leaguer...

1188
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:41,730
Don't tell me that the other bomb is located at...

1189
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:47,330
There's still a lot of time,

1190
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:49,730
but unless I figure out where it is...

1191
01:09:54,030 --> 01:09:55,430
Now listen, Conan.

1192
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:57,230
When you're finished what you're doing, next...

1193
01:09:57,230 --> 01:10:00,030
Hey, Officer Takagi.

1194
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:01,830
What is it, Conan?

1195
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:05,030
I have something I want to discuss with you.

1196
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:11,230
Hey, what's going on?

1197
01:10:11,230 --> 01:10:13,430
Now, it's the helicopters of the TV stations!

1198
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:16,230
I wonder if something's happened after all.

1199
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:18,130
Hey!

1200
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:19,130
Crap!

1201
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:22,430
We're having a test now. Be quiet.

1202
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:25,230
The time now is 11:40.

1203
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:29,330
There is less than 20 minutes to go before the bomb is to go off.

1204
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:33,130
The boy and the police officer who are trapped together with the bom

1205
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:35,430
have not been rescued yet.

1206
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:37,730
Time is definitely ticking away.

1207
01:10:37,730 --> 01:10:41,930
What will become of the boy and police officer?

1208
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:47,030
Will they perish together with the symbol of Tokyo?

1209
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:51,830
What? He can't cut the cord?

1210
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:54,330
There are only three more left!

1211
01:10:54,330 --> 01:10:58,330
First, the yellow cord to switch off the liquid crystal panel.

1212
01:10:58,330 --> 01:11:01,630
Next, the white cord that is connected to the mercury lever.

1213
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:04,330
And the black telephone cord that is set there

1214
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:07,630
for remote control manipulation.

1215
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:10,030
If you cut it in that order, the bomb will stop completely.

1216
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:14,430
How come you can't do that when you've already gone that far?

1217
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:15,630
Give me that!

1218
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:17,430
Officer Takagi! Just what are you doing?

1219
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:19,930
Hurry! Hurry and cut it!

1220
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:22,730
No. We can't cut it.

1221
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:26,130
What are you talking about? You've only got 10 minutes left.

1222
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:28,630
"To the brave police officer."

1223
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:29,930
What?

1224
01:11:29,930 --> 01:11:34,130
"In praise of your courage, we will give you a prize.

1225
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:38,430
A clue to another bigger firework will be displayed

1226
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:42,030
at 3 seconds before the explosion.

1227
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:44,430
With best wishes."

1228
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:49,730
Conan says these are the words that are displayed on the LCD panel.

1229
01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:53,930
I would at least like to get Conan to evacuate somehow,

1230
01:11:53,930 --> 01:11:55,130
but in order to specify the other place where the bomb is set

1231
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:56,530
and to avoid a large number of casualties,

1232
01:11:56,530 --> 01:11:58,430
there seems to be no other choice

1233
01:11:58,430 --> 01:12:00,830
than for Conan to look at the hint

1234
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:06,530
and for me to relay the location by phone.

1235
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:11,030
I'm sorry.

1236
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:14,030
Officer Takagi.

1237
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:18,630
But you understand, don't you?

1238
01:12:21,530 --> 01:12:22,730
Stupid.

1239
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:26,830
4 minutes to go!

1240
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:29,130
There's only 4 more minutes till the bomb goes off.

1241
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:31,730
The timer has not been stopped yet.

1242
01:12:31,730 --> 01:12:34,430
Mr. Bomber. If you are watching this broadcast,

1243
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:38,030
please stop the timer, please!

1244
01:12:38,030 --> 01:12:41,330
If you have a tinge of conscience left in you.

1245
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:45,230
Heck with conscience...

1246
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:51,430
I still can't believe that it's all working out so well.

1247
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:53,930
Then, why don't you pick the broadcast of the TV on radio

1248
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:56,530
and listen to our heroic story?

1249
01:12:59,930 --> 01:13:02,630
The timer of the bomb is still moving.

1250
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:05,230
-What? -Mr. Bomber, are you watching?

1251
01:13:05,230 --> 01:13:08,930
Don't tell me the remote control didn't work right!

1252
01:13:08,930 --> 01:13:12,330
Let them be. We got the money already besides.

1253
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:16,030
I'm going to go tell the police how to...

1254
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:17,330
Hey!

1255
01:13:17,330 --> 01:13:19,030
Stop the bomb!

1256
01:13:19,030 --> 01:13:20,630
Hey! Wait!

1257
01:13:31,330 --> 01:13:33,130
The police...

1258
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:37,330
Those cops took advantage of his conscience

1259
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:39,630
and killed him.

1260
01:13:41,530 --> 01:13:43,930
I feel sorry for the brat.

1261
01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:45,630
But if the bomb goes off, the police will be blamed

1262
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:47,330
for not being able to save the kid.

1263
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:49,930
If they go chicken and stop the bomb before it explodes,

1264
01:13:49,930 --> 01:13:53,530
they lose the hint and a greater number of casualties is inevitable.

1265
01:13:56,630 --> 01:14:00,230
I'm going to make this public to the media

1266
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:05,030
and colossal blunder of the police will be exposed in broad daylight.

1267
01:14:05,030 --> 01:14:08,830
Either way, the cops are done for.

1268
01:14:14,430 --> 01:14:18,130
I see. That code had such a meaning.

1269
01:14:20,130 --> 01:14:23,730
If you talk too loud, the bomber will hear us.

1270
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:28,030
But there are more than 400 places in Tokyo

1271
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:30,530
that fit into that category.

1272
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:37,130
Yes. It would be impossible to check all the places from now

1273
01:14:37,130 --> 01:14:38,930
without the bomber noticing.

1274
01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:43,330
If we try to evacuate all the people

1275
01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:45,530
that are at the more than 400 locations...

1276
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:47,530
Judging from the bomber's character,

1277
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:50,230
he will probably turn the switch on using remote control.

1278
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:55,130
In other words, to definitely save everybody...

1279
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:56,930
We've no other choice

1280
01:14:56,930 --> 01:14:59,430
but to look at the hint pinpoint the location

1281
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:02,230
and look for the bomb.

1282
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:06,230
Just like Officer Matsuda did, right?

1283
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:07,730
Yes.

1284
01:15:07,730 --> 01:15:09,130
And besides,

1285
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:12,230
the person that I don't want to let die no matter what,

1286
01:15:12,230 --> 01:15:15,730
one who is very precious to me may be there.

1287
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:20,630
I'm sorry, Officer Takagi.

1288
01:15:20,630 --> 01:15:22,730
It's okay.

1289
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:25,230
Hey, Conan.

1290
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:28,930
While you're at it, tell me one more thing, will you?

1291
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:33,530
Who on earth are you?

1292
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:37,530
If you want to know...

1293
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:41,830
I'll tell you...

1294
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:49,830
In the world beyond.

1295
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:52,230
The two have not been rescued yet.

1296
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:54,030
There is only a minute left.

1297
01:15:54,030 --> 01:15:55,630
The seconds are ticking away!

1298
01:15:55,630 --> 01:15:58,330
Hey! What's going on?

1299
01:15:58,330 --> 01:16:01,530
Conan and Officer Takagi are still inside!

1300
01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:03,430
Oh, well...

1301
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:05,330
It seems that the members of the riot task force

1302
01:16:05,330 --> 01:16:06,830
has also been ordered to evacuate!

1303
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:10,530
-What? -Take the car back to Toto Tower!

1304
01:16:10,530 --> 01:16:12,230
Hey, it's dangerous, dangerous!

1305
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:14,230
Take the car back! Hey, Chiba!

1306
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:16,130
Take the car back! Take it back!

1307
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:18,430
They listened to it.

1308
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:21,930
The same words of the devil, as 3 years ago...

1309
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:30,530
But I know you guys, the Youth Detective Squad,

1310
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:33,030
will be able to take care of things even if I'm not around, right?

1311
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:35,430
Conan!

1312
01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:39,430
15 seconds to go.

1313
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:41,930
Are you ready, Officer Takagi?

1314
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:43,230
Yeah.

1315
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:46,730
I wrote all your deductions in the mail.

1316
01:16:46,730 --> 01:16:49,430
All I have left to do now is to punch in the hint you're going to read

1317
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:50,830
and send it out.

1318
01:16:52,230 --> 01:16:53,830
It's going to be coming out soon.

1319
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:55,530
The first letter is...

1320
01:16:55,530 --> 01:16:56,830
The letter...

1321
01:16:56,830 --> 01:16:58,430
E...

1322
01:16:58,430 --> 01:16:59,930
V...

1323
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:01,430
I...

1324
01:17:01,430 --> 01:17:02,430
T...

1325
01:17:02,430 --> 01:17:04,630
No!

1326
01:17:12,830 --> 01:17:15,730
Get out of there...

1327
01:17:15,730 --> 01:17:17,630
Get out of there, Ran!

1328
01:17:19,630 --> 01:17:21,330
Shinichi?

1329
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:24,930
Ran!

1330
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:33,270
Takagi!

1331
01:17:44,770 --> 01:17:47,570
Conan! Hurry, what's next?

1332
01:17:52,970 --> 01:17:54,570
What? What the...

1333
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:57,370
The slightest shake will set the bomb off!

1334
01:17:57,370 --> 01:17:58,370
Huh?

1335
01:17:58,370 --> 01:18:00,670
I was too scared to die after all,

1336
01:18:00,670 --> 01:18:02,870
so I cut the rest of the cord and stopped the bomb.

1337
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:04,570
What?

1338
01:18:04,570 --> 01:18:06,070
I'm sorry.

1339
01:18:12,570 --> 01:18:14,570
Then, you stopped partway through the hint.

1340
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:17,170
Yes. With only the letters "EVIT",

1341
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:21,170
we can't tell where the other bomb is.

1342
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:22,770
Well, it can't be helped.

1343
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:26,270
Let's call the rescue squad and have them come rescue us.

1344
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:31,170
So, they went chicken after all.

1345
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:33,570
The kid's the one who stopped the bomb,

1346
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:36,870
but the people will think the police made him stop it.

1347
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:40,270
They'll think that the police sacrificed the lives of a lot of people

1348
01:18:40,270 --> 01:18:43,470
just to save their own skin.

1349
01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:51,070
Please listen to the people cheer!

1350
01:18:51,070 --> 01:18:53,370
The bomb has safely been stopped!

1351
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:56,070
Moreover, the one who disassembled the bomb

1352
01:18:56,070 --> 01:18:59,770
was boy who was trapped in the elevator!

1353
01:18:59,770 --> 01:19:02,470
Let's ask the boy some questions then.

1354
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:04,370
I'll bet you were scared, sonny?

1355
01:19:05,770 --> 01:19:07,570
"The Hero! A Primary Schooler" -Yes!

1356
01:19:08,270 --> 01:19:10,670
Shinichi?

1357
01:19:10,670 --> 01:19:14,870
But the police taught me how to do it really well,

1358
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:17,070
so I had an easy time taking it apart.

1359
01:19:18,070 --> 01:19:19,470
Officer Takagi.

1360
01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:24,470
Officer Sato.

1361
01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:27,170
Stupid. Don't blame yourself.

1362
01:19:27,170 --> 01:19:29,570
Two hours and a half left to go.

1363
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:32,270
Let's go look for the other bomb!

1364
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:33,870
But the thing is...

1365
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:42,970
I'm glad you're okay!

1366
01:19:42,970 --> 01:19:46,170
I knew you'd do it, Conan!

1367
01:19:46,170 --> 01:19:48,270
Just as would be expected of my following!

1368
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:53,070
Well, you did right to stop the bomb.

1369
01:19:53,070 --> 01:19:56,270
It's a silly thing to sacrifice your life

1370
01:19:56,270 --> 01:19:58,170
for people you don't even know.

1371
01:19:58,170 --> 01:20:00,370
Yeah, I guess so.

1372
01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:05,370
I'm sure that's what the bomber thought, too.

1373
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:14,170
Finally, only one more subject to go!

1374
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:19,570
What's the matter, Ran? You look depressed.

1375
01:20:19,570 --> 01:20:22,870
The next subject is your best subject, Japanese.

1376
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:25,070
Yes.

1377
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:26,070
I was just thinking that there sure are

1378
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:28,770
a lot of cars going in and out today.

1379
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:30,870
It's probably because they loading the ping-pong table

1380
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:32,670
into the warehouse of the gym in the basement.

1381
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:34,770
It seems that the next ping-pong tournament

1382
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:36,970
is going to be held at our school.

1383
01:20:38,170 --> 01:20:40,770
While they're at it, they should take the space-consuming drum cans

1384
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:43,670
that are inside the warehouse with them, too.

1385
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:45,370
What are you talking about?

1386
01:20:45,370 --> 01:20:46,670
Don't you know?

1387
01:20:46,670 --> 01:20:49,170
Because of those 5 big cans.

1388
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:52,670
It's so hard to take out the tennis net.

1389
01:20:55,470 --> 01:20:57,870
So, they couldn't find it after all.

1390
01:20:57,870 --> 01:20:59,570
Well, even if they were to find it now,

1391
01:20:59,570 --> 01:21:01,370
they wouldn't be able to evacuate.

1392
01:21:04,370 --> 01:21:07,670
There's only 5 seconds left to go.

1393
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:12,970
4, 3, 2, 1...

1394
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:14,470
0...

1395
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:16,070
Boom!

1396
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:21,770
Why? Why isn't it exploding?

1397
01:21:21,770 --> 01:21:24,470
Gosh! It can't be helped.

1398
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:26,270
I'll have to set the bomb off with remote control.

1399
01:21:31,070 --> 01:21:35,970
I'm sorry to say that your partner can't talk to you anymore.

1400
01:21:35,970 --> 01:21:39,670
The bomb disposal squad secretly went into school quietly taking care

1401
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:44,570
not to leave any voices on the wiretap that you set up

1402
01:21:44,570 --> 01:21:46,470
and took apart all 5 of the bombs

1403
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:50,470
that you set up in the drum cans.

1404
01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:55,470
You look as if you're wondering how we located the bombs.

1405
01:21:56,270 --> 01:21:58,770
We deciphered the code you sent of Toto Tower

1406
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:03,270
and the time of bombing as follows.

1407
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:06,170
"I am a Major Leaguer, a strong pitcher as well as batter.

1408
01:22:06,170 --> 01:22:09,370
Now, this is the beginning of an extended game.

1409
01:22:09,370 --> 01:22:12,570
No use getting ready a good stopper.

1410
01:22:12,570 --> 01:22:15,270
Because I will win in the end."

1411
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:17,070
The phrase "Major Leaguer" means

1412
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:20,170
to change everything into English.

1413
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:21,870
A good stopper means

1414
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:24,770
a pitcher with good earned run average.

1415
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:26,170
Extended game in English

1416
01:22:26,170 --> 01:22:29,170
is called Extra inning game.

1417
01:22:29,170 --> 01:22:32,670
The abbreviation of earned run average is ERA.

1418
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:38,770
If you remove the no use words "ERA" from the word "EXTRA",

1419
01:22:38,770 --> 01:22:40,670
you get "XT".

1420
01:22:40,670 --> 01:22:44,370
XT is written vertically and when it is "turned over",

1421
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:46,570
it becomes the Japanese Kanji character, "Bun".

1422
01:22:46,570 --> 01:22:49,870
That's the map symbol that stands for school.

1423
01:22:49,870 --> 01:22:54,970
And the hint that was displayed on the LCD panel of the first bomb,

1424
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:59,070
"EVIT" is the English spelling of "Detective",

1425
01:22:59,070 --> 01:23:03,370
that is, a part of it, spelled reverse.

1426
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:06,670
And if the Japanese for "Detective" is reversed,

1427
01:23:06,670 --> 01:23:08,970
it becomes "Teitan".

1428
01:23:08,970 --> 01:23:11,770
The school with the name Teitan has a grade school,

1429
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:13,670
intermediate school, high school and university,

1430
01:23:13,670 --> 01:23:17,470
but the only school where a lot of students gather during winter vacation

1431
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:19,570
is only Teitan High School

1432
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:22,570
that is holding national trial exams.

1433
01:23:23,570 --> 01:23:27,870
You didn't plant a fake bomb at the baseball park

1434
01:23:27,870 --> 01:23:30,270
is because you wanted to keep everyone's attention away

1435
01:23:30,270 --> 01:23:32,770
from the schools with baseball grounds.

1436
01:23:32,770 --> 01:23:34,870
Well, but I guess you took us lightly

1437
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:37,070
looking through your binoculars from a conspicuous place like this,

1438
01:23:37,070 --> 01:23:40,670
keeping watch over Teitan High School. You lose this time.

1439
01:23:45,070 --> 01:23:46,370
Look out!

1440
01:23:48,670 --> 01:23:50,370
Gosh!

1441
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:01,870
-Sato... -Officer Sato!

1442
01:24:15,870 --> 01:24:17,370
Gosh!

1443
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:37,370
No!

1444
01:24:37,370 --> 01:24:38,670
Officer Sato!

1445
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:07,470
Wait!

1446
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:10,870
I'm not the one...

1447
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:13,570
It's one of those things that occur frequently.

1448
01:25:13,570 --> 01:25:17,170
I heard it in my head, a child's voice.

1449
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:20,170
It told me to kill the police.

1450
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:22,970
No, it told me to kill anybody.

1451
01:25:24,070 --> 01:25:26,370
Yeah.

1452
01:25:26,370 --> 01:25:28,570
That's why it's not my fault.

1453
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:33,870
To think that he was killed by a guy like this...

1454
01:25:36,770 --> 01:25:38,270
A guy like this!

1455
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:41,070
A guy like this!

1456
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:52,470
Officer Sato!

1457
01:26:09,370 --> 01:26:11,670
What do you think you're doing? Don't bother me!

1458
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:14,370
No, Officer Sato!

1459
01:26:14,370 --> 01:26:16,970
Let me go! Let me go, I said!

1460
01:26:16,970 --> 01:26:19,670
To think that he had to die for a guy like that!

1461
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:20,970
So, let me go!

1462
01:26:30,270 --> 01:26:32,970
Just what do you think you're doing, Officer Sato?

1463
01:26:34,370 --> 01:26:37,570
Wasn't it you who always said

1464
01:26:37,570 --> 01:26:39,570
to contribute to the nation and the citizens

1465
01:26:39,570 --> 01:26:41,870
with pride and a sense of mission,

1466
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:44,170
never to cringe in fear and hate

1467
01:26:44,170 --> 01:26:47,270
and at all times to respect the rights of people,

1468
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:50,970
and perform our duties as police officers with justice.

1469
01:26:50,970 --> 01:26:53,070
That's what you always said, right?

1470
01:26:59,170 --> 01:27:01,970
But...

1471
01:27:03,870 --> 01:27:05,170
Acting the way you are now,

1472
01:27:05,170 --> 01:27:08,370
I'm sure that Officer Matsuda will scold you.

1473
01:27:08,370 --> 01:27:11,270
Stupid...

1474
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:12,970
I want to forget him, but you...

1475
01:27:15,870 --> 01:27:18,170
Let me forget him!

1476
01:27:18,170 --> 01:27:19,670
You idiot!

1477
01:27:27,170 --> 01:27:30,270
You shouldn't forget him.

1478
01:27:33,270 --> 01:27:37,270
If it's a precious memory, you shouldn't forget it.

1479
01:27:37,970 --> 01:27:39,570
Once a person dies,

1480
01:27:39,570 --> 01:27:43,170
that person can only live within one's memory.

1481
01:27:45,670 --> 01:27:47,070
Officer Takagi.

1482
01:27:47,870 --> 01:27:49,370
Officer Takagi.

1483
01:28:02,670 --> 01:28:05,570
Hey! What was that gun shot just now?

1484
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:13,470
Well...

1485
01:28:13,470 --> 01:28:15,970
I fired one warning shot.

1486
01:28:15,970 --> 01:28:18,870
Don't tell me you wounded him or something?

1487
01:28:18,870 --> 01:28:21,570
We weren't kissing!

1488
01:29:54,270 --> 01:29:58,370
But it's really amazing that you stopped it.

1489
01:29:58,370 --> 01:30:01,870
You had less than 3 seconds to cut the cord, didn't you?

1490
01:30:01,870 --> 01:30:05,270
I had the wire cutter in hand

1491
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:08,270
in case I figured out the clue midway.

1492
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:11,670
Besides, I couldn't afford to let Officer Takagi die.

1493
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:13,470
But you're really something to figure out that

1494
01:30:13,470 --> 01:30:18,570
just by seeing "EVIT" it's the reverse of "Detective".

1495
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:20,570
You can say that again!

1496
01:30:20,570 --> 01:30:24,470
Idiot. Of course I'd figure it out.

1497
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:28,770
I've been hoping that it wouldn't be there.

1498
01:30:28,770 --> 01:30:31,970
I've been hoping from the very start that it wouldn't be there.

1499
01:30:34,270 --> 01:30:36,470
Hey, Sato.

1500
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:39,270
We're going to visit Shiratori at the hospital.

1501
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:41,370
Yes, I'm coming!

1502
01:30:43,770 --> 01:30:46,770
"Erase message?"

1503
01:30:51,470 --> 01:30:53,370
"Deleted"

1504
01:30:53,970 --> 01:30:57,870
Goodbye, Officer Matsuda.

1505
01:30:57,870 --> 01:30:59,170
But...

1506
01:31:03,270 --> 01:31:06,570
But I won't forget you.

1507
01:31:11,650 --> 01:31:13,950
Next Conan's Hint:

1508
01:31:13,950 --> 01:31:15,750
"Door glass"
