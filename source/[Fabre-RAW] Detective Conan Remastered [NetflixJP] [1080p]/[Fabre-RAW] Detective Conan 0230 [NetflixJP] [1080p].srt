1
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,880
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,780
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,380
Today's episode occurs inside a bus filled with danger.

4
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,280
Ai is acting strange.

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,880
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,680
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,780
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,990
Did you see that? He just left.

9
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,290
The client left with a happy face.

10
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,090
He doesn't realize that was his last drink.

11
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,790
Isn't that right, bro?

12
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,490
Bro?

13
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,590
So that diva's up next?

14
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,090
Every time I hear her sing, it sends shivers down my spine.

15
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,490
And she's good looking too.

16
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,390
She's your type, isn't she?

17
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,990
Dry martinis for you two.

18
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,690
Compliments of the diva.

19
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,390
Well, that's mighty kind of her.

20
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,290
What's the meaning of this?

21
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,890
Huh?

22
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,490
I asked you what the heck you're doing!

23
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,890
I already know all about you!

24
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,890
What?

25
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,490
Vermouth.

26
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,990
I'm just kidding.

27
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,990
It was a joke. A joke.

28
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,390
Don't get so angry.

29
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,390
I was just teasing the guys

30
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,790
who have the hots for that diva.

31
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,190
That's all.

32
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,690
Sure, but are you sure this is okay?

33
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,790
I mean you're a famous actress.

34
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,090
What if someone saw you with us?

35
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,790
Don't worry about it.

36
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,990
Everyone's attention is on the diva who's up next.

37
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,190
Never mind that.

38
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,390
Did you find what you were looking for?

39
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,590
Well...

40
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,990
Not exactly what I was looking for, but...

41
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,390
What are you looking for anyway?

42
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,790
Don't you think it's about time you tell us

43
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,390
where you're at and what you're doing.

44
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,090
No use asking.

45
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,990
This woman never reveals her secrets.

46
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,190
You just don't understand, do you?

47
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,390
A secret makes a woman a woman.

48
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,990
A woman becomes beautiful

49
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,690
when she has secrets to hide.

50
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,490
You make me sick.

51
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,190
Never mind about me. What about you?

52
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,090
Did you find that little kitten that got away from you?

53
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,690
No.

54
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,190
But it won't be long before I do.

55
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,590
My nose can sniff out a traitor wherever they are.

56
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,790
And when I do, I'll show them what real fear is.

57
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,390
I'll teach both of them, her and that boyfriend of hers.

58
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:19,090
"Mysterious Passenger (Part 1)"

59
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,890
Next stop, Beika 3rd chome,

60
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,190
front of the Kodama Products main building.

61
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,690
Next stop, Beika 3rd chome,

62
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,190
front of the Kodama Products main building.

63
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,140
Hey, Dr. Agasa.

64
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,440
Are you sure you're up to ski?

65
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,740
It's his own fault.

66
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,540
I told him to stop because he would catch a cold

67
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,240
but he stayed up all night watching

68
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,840
those "How to Ski" tapes for image training.

69
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,140
I guess you're right.

70
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,440
I'm in charge of you kids.

71
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,840
I've got to set a good example.

72
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,040
But when we get there,

73
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,740
you've got keep still and stay in bed at the lodge.

74
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,240
Like they say, the beginning of a cold

75
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,240
is the most crucial time.

76
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,140
You'd better not push yourself and go outside.

77
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,040
All right.

78
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,940
Come on, I can't tell who the kid is.

79
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:59,340
Next stop, in front of Beika Park...

80
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,640
Hey. The passengers are boarding now.

81
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,440
Please stay in your seats.

82
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,240
Yes, sir.

83
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,140
Oh, my. You look like you're about to die from boredom.

84
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,740
You look very sad

85
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,640
since you won't be able to see her for a long time.

86
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,840
Huh?

87
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,740
Or could it be...

88
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,140
that you're sad because you won't be able

89
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,840
to see those guys?

90
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,740
You're nuts.

91
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,740
These passengers have nothing to do with me.

92
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,940
Who'd be crazy enough

93
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,040
to want to run into those guys in a small bus like this?

94
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,840
Especially with all these kids on board...

95
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,640
Is he one of those men in black?

96
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,440
No, he isn't.

97
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,440
I can tell, they have a smell.

98
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,740
It's an unpleasant smell,

99
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,440
only those who're in the organization give it off...

100
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,540
You don't smell funny.

101
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,340
Will you stop kidding around?

102
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,440
But if you have that sixth sense,

103
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,940
what happened with Pisco?

104
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,140
Well, I had my suspicions.

105
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,640
Then why didn't you say something?

106
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,340
I wasn't absolutely sure.

107
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,140
I had a feeling there was one more.

108
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,940
That's right. Someone worse than Pisco.

109
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,740
I felt an aura that made my skin prickle.

110
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,640
Kudo.

111
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,540
Change seats with me and hide me.

112
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,540
Please!

113
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,740
Haibara.

114
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,440
Look! It's Mr. Araide!

115
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,240
I didn't expect to see all of you on this bus too.

116
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,440
We took our physical examination at school yesterday.

117
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,740
Yes, I know.

118
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,740
Hey. Is something wrong with Mr. Araide?

119
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:27,540
I just remembered. You weren't there yesterday.

120
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,440
Are you on a date, sir?

121
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,340
No, she's a teacher at Teitan High School.

122
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,340
I'm the school doctor there.

123
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,340
Hi, boys and girls!

124
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,540
You're that cool kid.

125
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,140
So we meet again.

126
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,790
-Do you know her? -Yes.

127
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:50,690
She teaches English at Ran's high school.

128
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,090
My name is Jodie Saintemillion.

129
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,090
I'm on a date with Dr. Araide.

130
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:59,290
We're going to the Ueno Art Museum.

131
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:03,290
No, we met at the bus stop quite coincidentally.

132
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:06,190
You shouldn't embarrass a lady.

133
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,990
It wouldn't be good for rumors to go around school about us.

134
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,590
Isn't that right?

135
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,090
Yes.

136
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,390
That would be a problem.

137
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,290
Hey, look.

138
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,790
Look at those two.

139
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,990
We're not even there yet and they're already in their ski suits!

140
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,690
They probably can't wait.

141
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,890
But I know how they feel.

142
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,190
I do, too.

143
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:07,190
Good grief. Why is he putting his goggles on in the bus?

144
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,990
Why don't we change too?

145
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,390
Don't you remember? We sent our bags on ahead.

146
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,890
Oh, that's right!

147
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,390
Genta, you're so forgetful.

148
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,190
Nobody move!

149
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,290
Move and you're dead.

150
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,590
What is this?

151
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,590
It's them.

152
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,690
Nobody move!

153
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,990
Move and you're dead.

154
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,690
What's going on?

155
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,190
Are they hijacking the bus?

156
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,590
What is this?

157
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,890
What the?

158
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,790
Don't you have ears?

159
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,990
I told you to shut up!

160
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,090
Hey.

161
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,190
Yes?

162
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:23,090
First off, let's close the front doors.

163
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,290
Yes, sir.

164
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,590
Next, let's change the destination sign to read "Not in Service".

165
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,890
Yes, sir.

166
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:39,690
Now then, let's get this bus moving.

167
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,090
Just drive through the city.

168
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,290
Yes, sir!

169
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,390
Hurry up!

170
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,890
"Not in Service"

171
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:01,090
Listen. When we stop for a red light,

172
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,690
I want you to call your company.

173
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,190
Yes, sir.

174
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,490
Good. You're all being smart.

175
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:16,590
Now, I want all of you to get your cellular phones out

176
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:19,190
and hand them over to me.

177
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,690
Don't try to hide them.

178
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,190
If you do, I'll fix it so you never make another phone call.

179
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,390
This is W-707, Kobayashi.

180
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,790
W-707, Kobayashi.

181
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,990
Listen. We're being...

182
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,790
We've just hijacked your company's bus!

183
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,490
We only want one thing.

184
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,690
We want the release of Kunio Yajima who's in prison.

185
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,090
Tell the cops that if they don't do it,

186
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,790
we'll kill one passenger every hour.

187
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,690
We'll call you back in 20 minutes.

188
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,890
Get things settled by then.

189
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:18,790
Kunio Yajima...

190
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,690
One of the members of a gang of robbers, last month,

191
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,490
they made a bomb and tried to rob a jewelry store.

192
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,590
The leader of the gang, Kunio Yajima was the only one caught.

193
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,590
The other three are still at large.

194
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,590
I'm sure Yajima was once a jewelry broker.

195
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,190
I get it.

196
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,890
I'll bet the rest of the gang don't know what to do

197
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,490
with the jewels they stole

198
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,590
and they haven't gotten rid of them yet

199
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,690
so they're trying to break their boss out.

200
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:52,090
Or maybe only the boss knows where the jewels are

201
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,690
and they're trying to get him out of jail so they can get to it.

202
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:59,090
Hey, you! Hurry it up!

203
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,490
Sorry.

204
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,490
"Shuichi Akai (Passenger)"

205
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,890
I don't have a cellular phone.

206
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,190
Gosh, what a dork.

207
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,790
Hey, old man, you!

208
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,090
What's that in your ear?

209
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,090
It's a... a hearing aid.

210
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,890
I... I got hurt when I was young.

211
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,990
That's why I...

212
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,590
Hey, you! Stop that, it's noisy!

213
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,790
No can help, gum chewing's noisy.

214
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,690
You guys are wasting your time doing this.

215
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,590
You're going to get caught anyway.

216
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,390
I think you should give it up and make a run for it...

217
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,390
Okay, I get you.

218
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,890
I'll shut up.

219
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,190
Yeah.

220
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,690
That's what you should've done from the start.

221
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,990
Ouch...

222
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,490
What happened? Are you okay?

223
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,490
Yeah, fine.

224
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,690
You...

225
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,990
Jodie.

226
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,590
Sorry!

227
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,190
Oh, my God! What have I done?

228
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,890
Are you all right? I didn't mean that.

229
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:29,390
I always make a blunder and gets clumsy.

230
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,690
-Are you really... -Forget it!

231
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,390
Get back to your seat!

232
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,890
It's very, very exciting.

233
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,890
Good grief. Is this teacher really all right?

234
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:52,190
Anyway, while those guys are over there,

235
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,290
I've get to contact Inspector Megure on my earring shaped transmitter

236
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,390
to let him know what's going on in this bus.

237
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,890
What are you doing?

238
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,190
You little brat...

239
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,790
Brat! Try something like that again,

240
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,390
you're really going to get it!

241
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,790
I almost forgot.

242
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,940
I'm going to hang onto this.

243
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:29,290
Gosh. He took my phone.

244
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,690
Conan! Are you all right?

245
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,990
That's strange.

246
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,590
He came straight for me.

247
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,690
But I'm sure he couldn't see me. I was hiding behind the seat.

248
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,290
That must mean...

249
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,890
another one from their gang's on this bus.

250
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,390
It must be one of those three

251
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,290
since they could see what I was doing.

252
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,390
But how'd he let him know?

253
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,890
How'd he let him know where I was?

254
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,990
How'd he do it without anybody noticing?

255
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,190
This is Sato.

256
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:16,690
The hijacked bus is presently heading towards Takaido.

257
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,090
Travelling at a speed of approximately 50 kilometers.

258
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,090
This is Takagi, we're in position E.

259
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,390
The hijacked bus has just come into view.

260
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,890
There are two suspects on board.

261
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,290
Both are in ski suits.

262
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,890
I can't make out their faces because they have hats and goggles on.

263
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:35,690
It appears both suspects are armed.

264
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,890
What should we do, Inspector?

265
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,790
The bus might pass that way again.

266
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,690
Hold your positions.

267
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,790
Yes, sir!

268
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,190
Gosh! If both of them have guns,

269
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,590
then we have to move carefully.

270
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,690
Inspector.

271
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,490
The bosses upstairs just gave their orders.

272
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:02,090
First priority is for the safe release of the passengers.

273
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:05,190
The prisoner, Kunio Yajima,

274
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,390
is going to be released per the hijackers request.

275
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,090
I guess we have no other choice

276
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:15,390
being as it seems the hijackers have already fired 2 shots in the bus.

277
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:19,190
If they're part of that gang of jewelry robbers,

278
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:23,190
an explosives professional might be in there too.

279
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,990
If they explode some bombs in the city,

280
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,790
we're going to have a disaster on our hands.

281
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:31,390
But still, they're trapped like rats in there.

282
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:35,590
It appears that the bus is just moving through the streets randomly.

283
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,590
No, they have some kind of plan.

284
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,990
They intend to lose the police and escape.

285
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,990
They've got a plan.

286
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:49,190
So they've agreed to release him, huh?

287
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,790
All right then, tell Yajima when he's released

288
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,490
to call us back in 1 hour.

289
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:00,290
As soon as we know he's in a safe place,

290
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:03,190
we'll let the passengers go, three of them first.

291
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,190
Listen carefully. Don't do anything stupid!

292
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:20,490
Two ski bags in a row on the floor...

293
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,490
Could those be...

294
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,090
You again?

295
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:32,590
If you're not afraid of dying,

296
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,190
then I'll be glad to oblige.

297
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,990
Hey, little kid, stand up.

298
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,890
Conan!

299
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,390
Stop that!

300
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,190
He's just a little boy being mischievous!

301
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,690
Besides, you're getting what you asked for!

302
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,390
If you hurt even one passenger,

303
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,590
your plan's not going to go smoothly.

304
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,390
You've got some nerve!

305
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,490
You young punk...

306
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,090
Stop that!

307
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:05,990
If the bullet misses and hits "that thing", then what?

308
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,390
That's right.

309
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,190
Okay, you guys! Get back to your seats now!

310
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,490
Yes.

311
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,490
You said that if "that thing" got hit...

312
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,790
As I thought, in these bags...

313
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,590
Are there bombs in them?

314
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,390
I still don't know what these guys are going to do with these.

315
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,390
But I do know for sure

316
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,990
that one of those three in the back is part of their gang

317
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,890
and he's telling them about me.

318
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,090
I've got to find out somehow who it is.

319
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:38,990
Otherwise, there'll be nothing I can do.

320
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:43,190
Hey, Haibara. Do you have any ideas?

321
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,190
Hey.

322
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:49,290
What? What is this?

323
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:52,190
His choking pressure...

324
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:55,090
It's that same overwhelming feeling I got before.

325
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,290
He's here.

326
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,490
That guy's on this bus!

327
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:03,090
Is it one of the men in black? Are they after me?

328
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,590
Or is it just a coincidence?

329
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,090
If my identity is blown now...

330
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:12,990
If they realize I betrayed the organization...

331
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,690
Then Dr. Agasa and all the others on this bus...

332
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:18,890
Everyone will be killed!
