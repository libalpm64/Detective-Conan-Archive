five, six, seven, eigth, nine, ten.

3
00:00:11,007 --> 00:00:13,307
One, two...

4
00:00:19,607 --> 00:00:22,407
I give up.

5
00:00:27,407 --> 00:00:29,007
You're pretty good like always.

6
00:00:31,407 --> 00:00:33,007
Kazumi!

7
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:34,707
"Kazumi Tsukamoto(18)" -What brings you here?

8
00:00:34,707 --> 00:00:36,007
"Former Karate Captain" -I thought I'd flex my body a bit

9
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:38,507
because I've been doing nothing but studying for exams recently.

10
00:00:38,507 --> 00:00:41,407
Mouri, be my partner a while, will you?

11
00:00:41,407 --> 00:00:44,023
Yes. It's my pleasure.

12
00:00:48,707 --> 00:00:50,607
Give it all you got, okay?

13
00:00:50,607 --> 00:00:52,031
Of course.

14
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:25,607
Brooding over passing seasons

15
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:27,507
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

16
00:01:27,507 --> 00:01:29,307
Rooster Man appears at the shrines.

17
00:01:29,307 --> 00:01:31,507
And the mystery of the 9 monkeys emerges.

18
00:01:31,507 --> 00:01:33,107
He sees through the one and only truth.

19
00:01:33,107 --> 00:01:35,007
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:37,407
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

"The Tori's Pledge of Monkey and Rake (Part 1)"

22
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,440
"Ranburi Shrine, Second Rooster Day"

23
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,840
Quite a festival, isn't it?

24
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,840
So many different kinds of bamboo rakes are being sold.

25
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,840
Just as would be expected of Tori no Ichi.

26
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,179
This is the first time I've been here,

27
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:22,740
but I didn't think it be so grand.

28
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,185
What kind of rake did you guys come to buy anyway?

29
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,840
Isn't the rake to make business prosper.

30
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,640
Huh? Well...

31
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,840
You see, Ran has a karate competition coming up, right?

32
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,940
Right, I'm getting one to help me win again.

33
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,840
Does the rake sold at the Tori no Ichi have that kind of an effect?

34
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,240
Yes, it does.

35
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Long time ago, Prince Takeru Yamato who won in battle,

36
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,040
went to offer thanks to the shrine

37
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,140
on the day of the rooster in November

38
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,840
and hooked his weapon on the pine tree of the shrine.

39
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,217
That was the start of what became

40
00:03:58,217 --> 00:03:59,640
to be known as the Big Rooster Festival.

41
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,540
The market that was set up on the day of that festival

42
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,140
became the Tori no Ichi.

43
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,640
Wow, Conan, you sure know a lot.

44
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,240
There are other stories of stars starting to shine

45
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,840
on the day of the rooster in November

46
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,440
and Bodhisattva appearing.

47
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,840
There are yet various other stories that refer to the origin

48
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,235
of the Tori no Ichi as being the harvest festival

49
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:18,237
of the farmers and so forth.

50
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:20,239
Thus, the rake became somewhat

51
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,740
of a lucky charm for winning battles,

52
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,340
good fortune and prosperous business.

53
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,940
And, you saw all that on TV, right?

54
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,340
Oh, yeah, on the evening news.

55
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,040
Ran!

56
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,640
I found it, here it is!

57
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,840
The thing that Ranburi Shrine is known for

58
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
Lovely oracle!

59
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,040
It's an oracle that appears only during Tori no Ichi every year.

60
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,840
It tells you exactly what type of girl

61
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,840
for the boy that you like thinks is ideal for him!

62
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,540
Sonoko, you're taking it too seriously.

63
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,275
An oracle is just an oracle after all, you know.

64
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,840
Don't you know?

65
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,279
Sawako of class C did exactly as the oracle said

66
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,281
and confessed her feelings, and it turned out just great!

67
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,140
What? Really?

68
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:08,640
What're they doing?

69
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,640
Beats me.

70
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,340
Okay, I got my oracle.

71
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,940
So I wonder what Kyogoku's ideal type of girl is?

72
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,040
Shinichi's ideal type is...

73
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,305
Come to think of it, Shinichi said before that...

74
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:31,240
I have things that I want to ask about and say, too.

75
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,440
So, wait, okay?

76
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,240
Shinichi.

77
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,323
According to my deduction, the stuff you want to ask me

78
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,740
is probably the same thing I want to ask you about too.

79
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:02,140
Do you know, Shinichi?

80
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,740
I want to ask you if you care for me or not.

81
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,349
If your question is the same as mine,

82
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,040
is it possible...

83
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,340
Oh my god, just as I thought.

84
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,940
Aren't you going to open it, Ran?

85
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,840
No, I'll look at it alone when I get home.

86
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,440
No way!

87
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,940
Hey, wait.

88
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,369
Well...

89
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:33,440
Let's see what Shinichi's ideal type is.

90
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,040
In order to capture that heart of a nervous

91
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,940
and old-fashioned type like him.

92
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,040
It's best to be a Japanese woman with all the traditional graces.

93
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,381
Tomboys and girls that prefer flashy fashion are a no-no!

94
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,040
Stay graceful and refined.

95
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,340
It will surely bring you closer together.

96
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,740
It says.

97
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,940
I wonder if it's really true, though?

98
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,395
About him being the nervous type and old-fashioned?

99
00:06:56,395 --> 00:07:00,140
Well, Shinichi is very attentive to details

100
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,840
so I guess you could say he's the nervous type.

101
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,140
I guess so.

102
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,740
He's really not interested in fashion or anything like that,

103
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,140
so maybe he is the old-fashioned type after all?

104
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,411
Oh my, madam, you casually admitted, didn't you?

105
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:14,740
That you like Shinichi.

106
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,415
No! I'm just...

107
00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:20,419
Sure, sure! You can go on and confirm later

108
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:24,140
what your detective lover boy's ideal type is.

109
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,840
I'm going to the ladies room!

110
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,140
Hey... Thief!

111
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,140
Ran! Nab him!

112
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,040
Acting tomboy is a no-no.

113
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,140
Come on.

114
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:56,140
You should've just beat that guy up like usual with your karate.

115
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,840
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,840
Well, so long as you're not hurt, Ran, it's okay.

117
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,463
There wasn't anything all that valuable in that bag anyway.

118
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,440
What happened? What is going on?

119
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,540
A purse snatcher, purse snatcher!

120
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,140
The strap of my bag was cut off with a knife and my bag was stolen.

121
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,475
The culprit was wearing a mask.

122
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,640
A mask?

123
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,240
Yep. The mask of a funny face.

124
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
The mask of a funny face?

125
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,940
I saw it on the news last week.

126
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,840
The rooster man has struck again at the Tori no Ichi.

127
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,540
In succession to the Ichi no Tori that was held at the Sundei Shrine,

128
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,840
he struck again yesterday at the Ni no Tori

129
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,240
that was held at the Ranburi Shrine,

130
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,640
wearing the mask of a funny face.

131
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,840
The visitors at the shrine were struck one

132
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,503
after another by this purse snatcher.

133
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:46,505
The Rooster Man was given name

134
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:48,040
from his appearances at Rooster Festivals

135
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,540
and his cocky thieving acts

136
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,840
who is thought to strike elsewhere again.

137
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,040
The police plan on increasing the number officers

138
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,517
dispatched in preparation for the San no Tori festival

139
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:01,240
that is coming up at the end of this month.

140
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,540
But there are nearly 30 shrines

141
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,640
that are holding the Tori no Ichi

142
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,040
just in the Tokyo area, you know.

143
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,540
If within the entire Kanto district,

144
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,940
it would add up to no less than 50.

145
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,540
Can they really arrest him?

146
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,540
But, Sonoko was saying

147
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,940
that she's determined to go to the next Tori no Ichi

148
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,240
that'll be held at Ranburi Shrine

149
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,640
because she wants to take revenge!

150
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,340
How can you be so sure that he'll appear again at that shrine?

151
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,440
Beats me. She did sound confident, though.

152
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,240
Maybe she's planning on outwitting him

153
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,240
and thinks that he'll appear there again?

154
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,940
Well, he could go for the general notion

155
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,240
that a culprit never appears a second time

156
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,240
in a place that he has already struck once.

157
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,840
Then, why don't you guys go on your own!

158
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,840
I'm not going because it's too troublesome.

159
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,569
I guess it's tough to get hot over a Rooster Man.

160
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,940
"Third Rooster Day"

161
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,040
What's the matter, Ran?

162
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,240
It's unusual for you to be wearing a skirt?

163
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,840
Oh, it's just that

164
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,740
I figured this would be more appropriate

165
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,340
because it's cold today.

166
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,240
Oh, talk for yourself, Sonoko.

167
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,940
You're dressed more subdued than usual too, aren't you?

168
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,740
Oh? Well, at any rate.

169
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,740
Let's go take revenge!

170
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,040
But, do you know where the Rooster Man is?

171
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,340
No! Let's go pick out an oracle again!

172
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,340
The revenge you're referring is the oracle?

173
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,140
Lovely Oracle?

174
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,140
I'm going to pick out a good one this time!

175
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,240
The oracle is meaningless that way.

176
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:44,040
It's the Rooster Man! He's appeared again!

177
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,040
-What? -Did he really appear?

178
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,940
What's with that knapsack?

179
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,640
It's the Rooster Man's.

180
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,240
The Rooster Man threw it at the guys that went after him.

181
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,840
And, which way did the Rooster Man go?

182
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,940
He went running towards the park on the other side.

183
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:11,040
Hey, Conan?

184
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,653
Is there anything in here that was taken from you, Sonoko?

185
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,640
This is my bag!

186
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,640
So, he's the culprit himself and not somebody that copied him.

187
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,665
There's blood on the shoulder strap of the knapsack.

188
00:11:26,665 --> 00:11:30,340
Uh, which way did Rooster Man come fleeing from?

189
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,940
Yeah.

190
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,540
See, where there are a crowd of people from around there.

191
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,940
Hey, are you okay? Get a hold of yourself.

192
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,340
I'll get an ambulance right away.

193
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,340
Uh, was he attacked by Rooster Man?

194
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,691
Yeah. I heard a groan,

195
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:54,693
so I looked in that direction

196
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,440
and saw a person wearing a mask of a funny face

197
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,040
distancing away fleeing so.

198
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,440
Rooster Man probably tried to get away with this man's belongings

199
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,340
and stabbed him because he resisted.

200
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,140
It's not Rooster Man.

201
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:14,713
It's a monkey.

202
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:15,840
Monkey?

203
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,840
Hey, hey, just what does that mean?

204
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,840
What do you mean by monkey?

205
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,721
Weren't you stabbed by Rooster Man?

206
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,640
He... he's trying to say something.

207
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,040
But his voice...

208
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,240
9?

209
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:44,740
Hey, get a hold of yourself!

210
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,745
Not Rooster but Monkey.

211
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:50,140
9. What on earth does it mean?

212
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,240
9 monkeys?

213
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,840
What did he wants to say?

214
00:13:01,874 --> 00:13:03,274
I see.

215
00:13:03,274 --> 00:13:06,374
So, it's a play on words tori otoko-Rooster Man and mono tori-thief.

216
00:13:06,374 --> 00:13:08,274
That's why he's called Rooster Man.

217
00:13:08,274 --> 00:13:12,074
But, he's gone a bit too far this time,

218
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:14,274
trying to take the life of another.

219
00:13:14,274 --> 00:13:18,774
We've identified the victim who was attacked by Rooster Man.

220
00:13:18,774 --> 00:13:22,781
He is Mr. Shiro Masuko who resides in Haidocho, age 21.

221
00:13:22,974 --> 00:13:24,474
A university student who is studying

222
00:13:24,474 --> 00:13:26,785
to pursue literature at Tohoto University.

223
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:31,474
Oh, I hear the victim was taken to the hospital,

224
00:13:31,474 --> 00:13:32,791
but did he regain consciousness?

225
00:13:32,974 --> 00:13:34,474
Oh, no.

226
00:13:34,474 --> 00:13:35,874
The bag of that university student

227
00:13:35,874 --> 00:13:38,574
was also found in the knapsack,

228
00:13:38,574 --> 00:13:41,574
and we verified his identity from his driver's license that was inside.

229
00:13:41,574 --> 00:13:44,374
And, how's the university student doing?

230
00:13:44,374 --> 00:13:46,474
Fortunately, his stab wound is shallow

231
00:13:46,474 --> 00:13:47,974
but he's passed out

232
00:13:47,974 --> 00:13:51,674
from the pain of his wound and from shock.

233
00:13:51,674 --> 00:13:52,811
The doctor says that

234
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:55,674
he should be regaining consciousness in a little while.

235
00:13:56,815 --> 00:14:00,574
And? What brings you all here?

236
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:02,574
To take revenge, revenge!

237
00:14:02,574 --> 00:14:05,274
The other day, Sonoko's bag was snatched by the Rooster Man

238
00:14:05,274 --> 00:14:08,274
at the Ni no Tori that was held at this shrine.

239
00:14:08,274 --> 00:14:11,874
That's why we were staking out here at the Ranburi Shrine!

240
00:14:11,874 --> 00:14:15,374
I deduced that he'd try to outwit everyone and reappear here.

241
00:14:15,374 --> 00:14:20,074
No, you came to pick out another oracle, didn't you?

242
00:14:20,074 --> 00:14:24,843
Of course. I already got my bag from Rooster Man's bag.

243
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:29,874
Oh, no. That's evidence, so we can't give it back to you yet.

244
00:14:29,874 --> 00:14:33,574
So, it's just not somebody imitating the culprit, then.

245
00:14:33,574 --> 00:14:36,855
No. We're having victims from both Ichi no Tori

246
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:39,674
and Ni no Tori come here to confirm things.

247
00:14:39,674 --> 00:14:42,861
But, it seems that the culprit who appeared here at San no Tori

248
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:44,863
is also the same person as the one who appeared at the other two shrines.

249
00:14:44,863 --> 00:14:47,174
But, the only clue we have is that the culprit

250
00:14:47,174 --> 00:14:49,674
was wearing the mask of a funny face.

251
00:14:49,674 --> 00:14:51,974
There are other clues!

252
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,074
When everybody was saying that

253
00:14:54,074 --> 00:14:56,875
it seemed like the victim was stabbed by Rooster Man,

254
00:14:56,875 --> 00:15:00,074
the victim said it wasn't a rooster, but rather a monkey.

255
00:15:00,074 --> 00:15:00,879
A monkey?

256
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:04,874
And he also showed 9 fingers like this.

257
00:15:04,874 --> 00:15:06,174
So, the culprit could be someone

258
00:15:06,174 --> 00:15:08,887
having something to do with a monkey and the number 9.

259
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,574
Monkey and the number 9?

260
00:15:10,574 --> 00:15:12,074
9 monkeys.

261
00:15:12,074 --> 00:15:14,893
9 (Kyu). Monkey(saru).

262
00:15:15,074 --> 00:15:16,895
Kusaru (rotten)?

263
00:15:17,074 --> 00:15:19,374
Maybe the culprit is rotting.

264
00:15:19,374 --> 00:15:22,674
I'm sure that he's rotten to the gut.

265
00:15:22,674 --> 00:15:25,174
This is no time to be playing with words.

266
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,774
Inspector, we arrested Rooster Man!

267
00:15:27,774 --> 00:15:29,374
Really?

268
00:15:29,374 --> 00:15:32,911
Oh, but there're three of them.

269
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:34,913
Three of them?

270
00:15:35,074 --> 00:15:37,974
The people who went after Rooster Man

271
00:15:37,974 --> 00:15:41,174
saw him run inside the toilet

272
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,774
and reported it to the police.

273
00:15:46,174 --> 00:15:50,074
So, when you got there after getting the report,

274
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,574
the onlookers were all around the toilet.

275
00:15:53,574 --> 00:15:57,474
And, when you called out to tell the man to come out of the toilet,

276
00:15:57,474 --> 00:16:00,474
the ones who came out were those three men?

277
00:16:00,474 --> 00:16:04,174
Yes, sir. According to eye-witness reports,

278
00:16:04,174 --> 00:16:08,474
it's certain that Rooster Man ran into the men's room.

279
00:16:08,474 --> 00:16:10,274
After the three were taken out,

280
00:16:10,274 --> 00:16:12,474
we checked inside the toilet

281
00:16:12,474 --> 00:16:14,953
and found a knife, down jacket

282
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:19,374
and mask of a funny face stained with blood disposed of inside.

283
00:16:19,374 --> 00:16:23,474
I think it is unmistakable that Rooster Man went into this toilet!

284
00:16:23,474 --> 00:16:24,574
Yes.

285
00:16:24,574 --> 00:16:26,965
Besides, according to the onlookers,

286
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:28,967
everyone was scared that no one entered the toilet

287
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:31,874
until we arrived at the scene,

288
00:16:31,874 --> 00:16:34,973
so I think those three are the only ones who could be Rooster Man.

289
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:36,774
I see.

290
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:42,074
Okay, I'd like to talk to each of you one by one.

291
00:16:42,074 --> 00:16:46,274
Please give me your name and your purpose for coming here.

292
00:16:46,274 --> 00:16:48,974
"Tatsuo Hino (45)" -My name is Tatsuo Hino.

293
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,974
After buying this rake at Tori no Ichi,

294
00:16:51,974 --> 00:16:55,774
I happened to stop over at the restroom here, before heading home.

295
00:16:55,774 --> 00:16:58,997
I've been having stomach trouble lately.

296
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:00,999
See, I even have medicine for it on me, too.

297
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:03,274
You're Rooster Man, aren't you?

298
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:05,974
I mean, you look just like a monkey!

299
00:17:05,974 --> 00:17:08,674
It's... it's true that he resembles a monkey.

300
00:17:08,674 --> 00:17:09,574
Yes.

301
00:17:09,574 --> 00:17:13,786
Hey, hey, you're looking not for a monkey, but Rooster Man, aren't you?

302
00:17:13,786 --> 00:17:15,914
The person who was stabbed said...

303
00:17:15,914 --> 00:17:18,014
It wasn't a rooster but a monkey.

304
00:17:19,514 --> 00:17:22,214
But, I don't think he was referring to the face.

305
00:17:22,214 --> 00:17:25,314
Rooster Man was wearing the mask of a funny face,

306
00:17:25,314 --> 00:17:27,314
so he couldn't have seen the face, right?

307
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:30,014
Right.

308
00:17:30,014 --> 00:17:33,714
I... I came here not to come to the Tori no Ichi,

309
00:17:33,714 --> 00:17:37,814
but rather to communicate with other gamers.

310
00:17:37,814 --> 00:17:39,714
Communicate with other gamers?

311
00:17:39,714 --> 00:17:42,114
We exchange items and maps that are used in games

312
00:17:42,114 --> 00:17:44,114
through network communication.

313
00:17:44,114 --> 00:17:47,814
Since a lot of people come to the Tori no Ichi,

314
00:17:47,814 --> 00:17:51,049
I figured I could communicate with many people here.

315
00:17:51,214 --> 00:17:55,053
See, I got to communicate with 10 people today.

316
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:58,014
I confirmed that in the restroom.

317
00:17:58,014 --> 00:18:01,614
Okay, and what's your name?

318
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:04,114
We haven't gotten it from you yet, have we?

319
00:18:04,114 --> 00:18:07,614
"Hisami Sarukawa (20)" -Hisami Sarukawa.

320
00:18:07,614 --> 00:18:09,067
Saru (monkey). Saru (monkey)!

321
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:10,614
So, you're Rooster Man!

322
00:18:10,614 --> 00:18:11,714
Sonoko!

323
00:18:11,714 --> 00:18:15,414
But, I was never called "Saru"!

324
00:18:15,414 --> 00:18:17,414
My name is Hisami, so my nickname is taken

325
00:18:17,414 --> 00:18:20,314
from the kanji character of my name "Kyu", so I'm called Kyu-chan.

326
00:18:20,314 --> 00:18:22,214
-Kyu? -What?

327
00:18:22,214 --> 00:18:25,614
The victim indicated just before passing out,

328
00:18:25,614 --> 00:18:28,214
the number 9 along with the word monkey!

329
00:18:28,214 --> 00:18:33,091
But, I don't think the victim would know the snatcher's name.

330
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:35,714
True.

331
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:38,814
"Shinji Mizunoe (32)" -I'm Shinji Mizunoe.

332
00:18:38,814 --> 00:18:40,614
I stopped by at the restroom on my way

333
00:18:40,614 --> 00:18:44,814
to buying a rake for the company that I work for.

334
00:18:44,814 --> 00:18:47,914
Because I couldn't buy one at Ni no Tori.

335
00:18:47,914 --> 00:18:51,714
I actually went to buy one during Ichi no Tori,

336
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,214
but before I got to buy it, my bag with my wallet inside

337
00:18:54,214 --> 00:18:56,114
was snatched from me by Rooster Man.

338
00:18:56,114 --> 00:18:59,414
So, you were also victimized by Rooster Man?

339
00:18:59,414 --> 00:19:02,714
Yes, sir. Thanks to him, all I get to eat recently is lunch

340
00:19:02,714 --> 00:19:06,214
bought at convenience stores, because I don't have money.

341
00:19:06,214 --> 00:19:10,714
The same with today. I'm sure I've got the receipt.

342
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:13,814
I wonder where I put the receipt?

343
00:19:13,814 --> 00:19:16,714
We can figure out the victims pretty quickly.

344
00:19:16,714 --> 00:19:19,514
Yes, sir. If we check inside the knapsack of Rooster Man,

345
00:19:19,514 --> 00:19:20,514
it's very likely that...

346
00:19:20,514 --> 00:19:22,314
Is there anything in the bag that was taken from you

347
00:19:22,314 --> 00:19:25,614
that will prove that it belongs to you?

348
00:19:25,614 --> 00:19:28,514
Like a driver's license or I.D.?

349
00:19:28,514 --> 00:19:32,814
I think that a bank book in my name, is inside.

350
00:19:33,814 --> 00:19:34,914
You can check the kanji character of my name

351
00:19:34,914 --> 00:19:38,514
that's written "Shin". Please see for yourself.

352
00:19:38,514 --> 00:19:40,614
Okay. Check it right away.

353
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:43,161
Yes, sir.

354
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:46,714
You don't seem to have anything to do with monkey or the number 9.

355
00:19:46,714 --> 00:19:50,114
I'm a monkey in animal fortune telling though.

356
00:19:50,114 --> 00:19:52,714
Animal fortune telling?

357
00:19:52,714 --> 00:19:56,514
Outdated mean, how long ago was that stuff popular.

358
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:03,181
By the way, I hear that you two were also victims at the Ni no Tori,

359
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:06,314
but what rake did you come to buy?

360
00:20:06,314 --> 00:20:08,514
Well...

361
00:20:08,514 --> 00:20:12,314
They came to pick the Lovely oracle.

362
00:20:12,314 --> 00:20:15,193
Lovely oracle? What is that?

363
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:19,514
It's an oracle that is offered every year during Tori no Ichi.

364
00:20:19,514 --> 00:20:22,914
I have it on me now.

365
00:20:24,914 --> 00:20:27,714
There's a button inside together with coins.

366
00:20:27,714 --> 00:20:30,114
Where did I get this?

367
00:20:30,114 --> 00:20:32,814
Ran! Nab him!

368
00:20:33,814 --> 00:20:35,213
What's the matter?

369
00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:38,414
It's a purse snatcher! A snatcher!

370
00:20:38,414 --> 00:20:41,814
This could be the button from Rooster Man's clothes!

371
00:20:41,814 --> 00:20:43,014
What?

372
00:20:43,014 --> 00:20:46,014
Well, I bumped into Rooster Man.

373
00:20:46,014 --> 00:20:48,214
I'm sure that I picked it up at that time

374
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:51,229
when I was picking up the coins and put it in my coin purse.

375
00:20:51,414 --> 00:20:54,714
But, it could've been on the ground to begin with, right?

376
00:20:54,714 --> 00:20:58,614
But, if it's what you say it is, it could be very important proof.

377
00:20:58,614 --> 00:21:01,239
If among the three, there is one

378
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:04,214
that has clothes on that's missing the same button,

379
00:21:04,214 --> 00:21:07,245
then he's unmistakably Rooster Man!

380
00:21:07,414 --> 00:21:12,114
We would like to check inside your house immediately,

381
00:21:12,114 --> 00:21:13,251
would that be okay?

382
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:15,714
No, it's fine with me.

383
00:21:15,714 --> 00:21:18,714
If you explain the situation to mom, it's okay.

384
00:21:18,714 --> 00:21:21,014
If that's going to clear me from being a suspect,

385
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:22,814
I don't mind.

386
00:21:23,814 --> 00:21:26,014
Then, let's take a picture of this button right away

387
00:21:26,014 --> 00:21:27,614
and pass it out to the investigators.

388
00:21:27,614 --> 00:21:29,267
Have them confirm it immediately.

389
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:31,269
Yes, sir.

390
00:21:34,814 --> 00:21:40,114
Strange. The fact that Ran picked up a button that may be

391
00:21:40,114 --> 00:21:44,814
the Rooster Man's was found out of the blue just now.

392
00:21:44,814 --> 00:21:49,014
And yet, those three don't seem to bothered what so ever.

393
00:21:50,014 --> 00:21:53,291
Rooster Man appears at Tori no Ichi,

394
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,914
wears the mask of a funny face,

395
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:56,314
then steals the bags and belongings of others.

396
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:58,714
In other words, he's a purse snatcher.

397
00:21:58,714 --> 00:22:02,800
He didn't hurt anyone today,

398
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,914
but on the night of San no Tori,

399
00:22:04,914 --> 00:22:07,305
he ended up stabbing university student, Mr. Shiro Masuko

400
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:11,309
with a knife and wounded him seriously.

401
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:13,814
In the knapsack that Rooster Man left behind,

402
00:22:13,814 --> 00:22:16,314
the things of the people he stole from were inside.

403
00:22:16,314 --> 00:22:18,814
Therefore, he didn't seem to be a copy cat either.

404
00:22:18,814 --> 00:22:21,614
And just before Mr. Masuko passed out,

405
00:22:21,614 --> 00:22:25,314
he left behind the messages "monkey" and the number "9".

406
00:22:25,314 --> 00:22:29,314
What on earth do they mean?

407
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,614
Is Rooster Man really among the three people

408
00:22:31,614 --> 00:22:34,614
who are thought to be suspects?

409
00:22:34,614 --> 00:22:39,337
It's not going to be all that simple to solve this case.

410
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

411
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,423
"Oracle"

412
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,425
Maybe I'll go pick out an oracle too.

413
00:24:07,678 --> 00:24:09,427
It's unlucky for those who are in love, though!

414
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:10,960
I'll never pick an unlucky one up!
