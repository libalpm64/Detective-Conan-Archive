1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,640
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,340
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,940
Officer of police headquarters and the detective squad.

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,140
Love and mystery is on the verge of explosion.

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,040
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,370
Hey! Isn't that Hide?

9
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,670
Where? I can't see!

10
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,270
No! They said on radio just a while ago

11
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,570
that Hide is going to be riding the car at the end of the line!

12
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,270
Is that right?

13
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,970
It sure is unusual to have a soccer victory parade though.

14
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,770
It can't be helped.

15
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,670
Every year a big fuss is made

16
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,870
over the Tokyo Spirits being the winning candidate,

17
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,370
and finally this year

18
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,670
they won the J1 championship for the first time!

19
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,970
Moreover, they won by a dramatic come-from-behind victory.

20
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:41,970
Right!

21
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,570
In the second half lost time they were losing 1 to 0,

22
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,470
but Hide tied the game!

23
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,570
And then right after the playoffs, Naoki scored a V goal!

24
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,970
He was awesome!

25
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,670
But with all this crowd,

26
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,670
we can't really see the parade.

27
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,770
Right.

28
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,170
I even brought along my video camera.

29
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,470
It's so disappointing.

30
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,270
That's why I told you, right?

31
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,570
We should've kept watching TV like we were!

32
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,770
Come...

33
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,170
We set the video recorder before coming here,

34
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,370
so we can all watch it together later!

35
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,170
Hey! Maybe if we go there,

36
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,770
we can have a better view!

37
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,270
There! Over there!

38
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,370
I see!

39
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,670
If you go on top the empty cans container,

40
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,770
we may get a better view!

41
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,670
-Let's go! -Okay!

42
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,370
How is it?

43
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,770
Can you see?

44
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,570
Wait a second...

45
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,170
I can see glimpses of their heads

46
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,170
but not their faces.

47
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,770
It hurts...

48
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,670
Hey...

49
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,770
Darn it.

50
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,570
If it was only a bit higher!

51
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,270
But I don't see anything

52
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,970
that is higher than this empty cans container.

53
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,770
Neither do I...

54
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,270
-That's it! -That's it!

55
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,570
Hey...

56
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:05,770
"Parade of Malice and Saints (Part 1)"

57
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,870
I see him in the distance!

58
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,970
It's Hide!

59
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,570
Naoki is also behind!

60
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,970
It seems like he's looking this way and waving his hand!

61
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,170
Really?

62
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,370
Hey, let me see too!

63
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,270
Wait a minute.

64
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,970
This is the best part.

65
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,170
Hey!

66
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,670
You shouldn't climb up there!

67
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,470
I... I'm sorry.

68
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,170
I'll put him down right away.

69
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,670
Staying up here a little while won't hurt will it,

70
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,770
old lady?

71
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,370
Hey! What's with the old lady bit?

72
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,770
How dare you call me an old lady?

73
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,670
If you don't listen to me, I'm going to...

74
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,870
arrest you.

75
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,770
Officer Sato!

76
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,270
What are you doing dressed like that?

77
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,070
Oh, I get it!

78
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,470
You sneaked of from work

79
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,270
and came to watch the parade in secret!

80
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,170
I see! That's why you're in disguise!

81
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,470
No, I'm not!

82
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,170
I have my reasons.

83
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,270
You're on a date, right?

84
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,170
With Officer Takagi.

85
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,770
Yumi!

86
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,370
I happened to see...

87
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,970
Saw what?

88
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,770
Officer Takagi choosing a wig in the restroom just now.

89
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,770
Dating while on the move,

90
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,770
you guys are pretty cool!

91
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,270
-No! This is... -Then...

92
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,570
You can't talk about us.

93
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,170
You mean it's okay for officers to do stuff like that?

94
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,870
It's against service regulations.

95
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,570
What will become of the future of Japan?

96
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,570
I... I'm telling you, you got it all wrong!

97
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,270
We're on duty. On duty!

98
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,270
It's not a date!

99
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,070
Inspector Shiratori.

100
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,570
Why are you in disguise too?

101
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:52,770
We just received an odd fax at the headquarters a while ago.

102
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,070
"I am an anti-Spirit."

103
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,570
"Something interesting

104
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,370
will happen at the championship parade." It said.

105
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,570
And that fax was very similar

106
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,570
to the one that we handled previously.

107
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,870
That's why the First Investigation Division is here too.

108
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,670
But, the culprit knows our faces,

109
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,370
so we disguise ourselves while investigating.

110
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,070
Well, it's more likely a bad prank

111
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,670
of some jealous fans of the championship.

112
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,070
What?

113
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,770
So it's not a date.

114
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,870
No, it's not!

115
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,370
And besides,

116
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,570
the date in question,

117
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,770
is supposed to be next week.

118
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,270
I thought that you couldn't wait till then

119
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,470
so you both got eager and...

120
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,970
I guess not then.

121
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,570
Hey, how come you know about it?

122
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,070
Everybody knows about it.

123
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,770
You're going to Tropical Marine that just opened, right?

124
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,770
Everybody?

125
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,970
Don't take the Japanese police lightly.

126
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,170
If he takes a day off

127
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,270
on the day that you're off,

128
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,170
everybody can tell.

129
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,770
I heard that when Officer Takagi

130
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,670
was shoved into the interrogation room

131
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,070
and cross examined by everybody,

132
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,470
he confessed immediately.

133
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,370
Confessed?

134
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,670
About that...

135
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,070
Well, just be careful, okay?

136
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,570
It seems that a lot of other people

137
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,770
asked for the same day off too.

138
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,870
Right...

139
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,170
And it also seems that rental reservation

140
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,770
of the binoculars and communication equipment

141
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,870
for that day is full too.

142
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,470
Don't tell me that they're planning to keep an eye on us?

143
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,370
It sure sounds interesting.

144
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:41,570
Then, shall we go to Tropical Marine Land too!

145
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,470
Let's go!

146
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,070
You know what?

147
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,370
I'm just going out with Officer Takagi

148
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,870
because I want to show him my appreciation for helping me before!

149
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,770
So, it's not a date!

150
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,570
Really?

151
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,270
That's hard to believe.

152
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,070
I'm telling you it's true and I'm not lying.

153
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,470
Believe me.

154
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,270
And? You're just going to sit back

155
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,570
and watch this all take place, Inspector Shiratori?

156
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,870
Oh, no.

157
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,670
I'm not going to wave a white flag

158
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,170
just because she refused to marry me.

159
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:16,570
They still call each other very formally.

160
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,970
There's still room for me to try for her.

161
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,770
Besides, as far as this stakeout is concerned,

162
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,770
I'm the one in charge.

163
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,070
Is that right?

164
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,570
-Date... -Date...

165
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,370
Hey, Yumi. Help me out here, will you?

166
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,770
Give it your best shot!

167
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:42,370
Oh, my. Talk of the devil, look who's here.

168
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,370
You idiot.

169
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,470
Showing up at a time like this.

170
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,370
Mr. Matsuda.

171
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,270
It's Officer Takagi!

172
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,170
You're not hiding under your disguise at all!

173
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,070
You've figured me out after all.

174
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,170
I had no idea that you guys would be here, though.

175
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,370
But all three police officers were surprised!

176
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,170
Really?

177
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,670
Yes. Sort of.

178
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,970
How about you, Ms. Sato?

179
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,370
Don't you think I disguised myself quite well?

180
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,970
Ms. Sato?

181
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,670
Inspector Megure gave you instructions saying that

182
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,470
you don't have to disguise yourself, didn't he?

183
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,970
Oh, yes.

184
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,470
But, I thought I should anyway.

185
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,770
Then, why do you come dressed like that?

186
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,770
I... I'm sorry.

187
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,570
Now that you know, get rid of that disguise right away

188
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,170
and go back to your post!

189
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,170
Understand?

190
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,970
Okay.

191
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:21,070
I wonder if I did something I shouldn't have.

192
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,570
Nope. You just kind of resembled him.

193
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,370
The you just a while ago.

194
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,770
Him?

195
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,770
The officer who was employed for only seven days

196
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,770
at First Investigation Division

197
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,670
before you came to headquarters.

198
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,270
Hide!

199
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,170
-Naoki! -Naoki!

200
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,470
The car that Hide is in seems to have come!

201
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,670
Let's force ourselves to the front and take a video of him!

202
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,670
But since I've been taping from a while ago,

203
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,170
I don't think there's much tape left already.

204
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,370
You mean you didn't bring any spare tape?

205
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,270
I brought it!

206
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,770
Then, insert it and let's get on with it!

207
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,770
Okay.

208
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,870
Come on! Hurry!

209
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,470
Please wait.

210
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,270
I wonder if everything's going to be okay.

211
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,970
You received an odd fax saying that

212
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,670
something was going to happen at this parade, didn't you?

213
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,770
Yes.

214
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:25,470
But it seems to have been a prank after all.

215
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,870
By the way, what are you doing here, Yumi?

216
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,670
I've come to back up giving tickets for illegal parking!

217
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,670
There seems to be a lot of people

218
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,070
parked their cars all over the street

219
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,670
in order to see the parade, so...

220
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,470
You better move your car quickly too, Officer Takagi!

221
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,770
Or I'll have to give you a parking ticket!

222
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,770
I'll move it right away.

223
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,370
Where are you, everybody?

224
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,570
Excuse me, somebody...

225
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,370
Hold on!

226
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,570
Congratulations!

227
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,970
But aren't you a fan of Big Osaka?

228
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,170
It's a wonder you came to watch this parade.

229
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,370
I came to place a curse

230
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,970
that they won't win next year.

231
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,770
Hey, where were you?

232
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,270
You've got to film it quick

233
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,870
or the car's going to leave!

234
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,470
Well, the thing is...

235
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,070
The key...

236
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,170
There.

237
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,670
Oh, boy.

238
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,770
It's not my day today.

239
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:42,370
What? Somebody took your video camera?

240
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,870
Yes. Just a while ago, in the crowd.

241
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,170
What is this?

242
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,970
"Unknown number"

243
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,370
What happened?

244
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,240
This is bad.

245
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,940
Cancel the parade immediately

246
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,940
and evacuate the people!

247
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,040
Yes, sir!

248
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,140
What was that?

249
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,540
A bomb.

250
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,840
It seems like a car blew up.

251
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,140
Isn't that car Officer Takagi's car?

252
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,140
Don't tell me that Officer Takagi...

253
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,940
It's possible.

254
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,840
Because just a while ago, I saw somebody go over to that car

255
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,940
from the space between the crowds.

256
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,340
Darn it!

257
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,640
Hey, Conan!

258
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,040
Inspector Shiratori!

259
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,240
Where's Officer Takagi?

260
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,940
It exploded

261
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,740
just as he went over to the car to move it.

262
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,040
If he got caught in the explosion,

263
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,540
I doubt that he would make it.

264
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,140
Then, you mean that Officer Takagi...

265
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,840
Oh, no.

266
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,340
That's only if the worst happens.

267
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,940
What's that supposed to mean?

268
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,640
I made it to safety by a hair's breadth,

269
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,540
so please don't talk like I didn't make it!

270
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,140
Officer Takagi!

271
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,840
You're okay!

272
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,040
Yeah, somehow.

273
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,940
I coincidentally found a paper bag

274
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,040
that wasn't under the car when I parked.

275
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,740
Just when I was about to return

276
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,140
and consult with Inspector Shiratori that this may be a bomb...

277
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,140
The car exploded.

278
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,840
It's amazing that you though the content

279
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,340
inside the paper bag may have been a bomb.

280
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,640
Oh, that's because...

281
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,540
It's only natural.

282
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,240
I mentioned already

283
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,440
that the fax that was received at headquarters

284
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,040
resembled the one of a case

285
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,040
that we were involved with previously, right?

286
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,740
If the officer was briefed on the case failed to notice

287
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,340
that it may have been a bomb, something is wrong.

288
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,140
Talk about failing to notice, look at her.

289
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,640
She still doesn't seem to realize that you're okay.

290
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,340
-Let's stop her! -Officer Sato?

291
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,440
Officer Takagi...

292
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,040
No, Sato! You won't make it!

293
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,640
It's dangerous, stay back!

294
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,140
But, he's still inside.

295
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,640
He's still inside...

296
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,140
He's inside!

297
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,340
Hey, Miwako!

298
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,840
What do you think you're doing?

299
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,440
I... I'm trying to lift the car up and get him out.

300
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,440
Officer Takagi is fine. See?

301
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,140
Officer Sato?

302
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,640
Aren't that burns on the palm of your hands!

303
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,040
Hey, we've got to treat it right away!

304
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,540
I guess so.

305
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,140
I'll let you take care of things from here then.

306
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,740
Tears?

307
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:27,040
It seems that the one Officer Sato was trying to rescue was...

308
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,440
Yes.

309
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,540
Probably Officer Matsuda.

310
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,140
Officer Matsuda?

311
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,540
The type of bomb is a plastic bomb!

312
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,740
The detonating device is not the timer type,

313
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,140
but wireless!

314
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:47,240
A cell phone or something was probably used to activate it.

315
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,140
Then, don't tell me that...

316
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,340
Yes.

317
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,440
The bomber was probably

318
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,340
watching you approach the car from somewhere nearby,

319
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,940
and pushed the switch of the detonation device.

320
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,340
What?

321
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,540
Right.

322
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,240
Which means that although the type of bomb is not the same,

323
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,540
there's a high probability that

324
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,240
the bomber is after the lives of the police force,

325
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,240
just as was the case three years ago!

326
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,740
So, all of you keep that in mind

327
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,440
and work with great care,

328
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,440
yet speedily to arrest the bomber.

329
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,440
Excuse me.

330
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,540
What is it?

331
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:27,940
The bomber could've been filmed in the video camera!

332
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:32,940
Mitsuhiko was taking video all through right near the site.

333
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,240
Really?

334
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,340
Yes.

335
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,340
Besides, somebody among the crowd,

336
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,240
who were watching the parade, stole the camera.

337
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,040
-Yes. -The camera was stolen?

338
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,240
Yes but the tape is fine!

339
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,940
He inserted a new tape just before the camera was stolen

340
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,740
because he was running out of tape.

341
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,140
The video camera's fine too!

342
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,640
It was thrown away

343
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,540
in a trash can of a nearby station with only the tape removed!

344
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,540
Which means the person who stole the camera,

345
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,440
wanted the tape and not the camera, right?

346
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,840
The only ones who would do something like that

347
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,440
has to be a fervent fan of the Spirits

348
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,640
that wanted the film of the parade

349
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,140
or someone who didn't want to be taped,

350
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,540
like the bomber, right?

351
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,940
We connected it to a large monitor

352
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,240
and looked through it but...

353
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,740
It was mostly only Mitsuhiko's feet.

354
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,340
I forgot that I kept the filming

355
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,340
with the camera facing down.

356
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,940
I can tell what you guys are talking about.

357
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,640
But the scene cannot be seen on the tape.

358
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,240
Inspector Megure gave you instructions saying that

359
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,640
you don't have to disguise yourself, didn't he?

360
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,940
Who is this man?

361
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,440
I'm sorry, that's me.

362
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,740
How come you taped this part okay?

363
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,340
I'm sorry, I just happened to film it.

364
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,340
Hey, Officer Sato looks to be crying.

365
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,740
Oh, no, well you see this is...

366
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:18,140
Somebody is behind you near the car.

367
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,940
It looks like a passerby...

368
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,140
Besides, at this distance

369
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,440
it's hard to tell one person from the next.

370
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,440
Oh, no! The camera's face down again!

371
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,140
And that's the end of the tape.

372
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,640
It seems that the scene

373
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,840
that we were expecting of the bomber placing the paper bag

374
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,940
under Officer Takagi's car was not filmed.

375
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:47,040
Maybe something was filmed in the first part of the tape,

376
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,140
that among the crowd!

377
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,940
Why don't we rewind the tape and look at it then?

378
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,140
Yes, this is Megure.

379
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,240
What?

380
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,540
Another bomb went off?

381
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,440
Yes.

382
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,940
This time it was at the phone booth in front of Haido Park.

383
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,840
Fortunately, nobody's been hurt, though.

384
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,340
From the type of bomb that was used,

385
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,340
it's most likely the same bomber.

386
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,240
Okay, got it.

387
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,340
Go on and continue investigations.

388
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,440
Hey.

389
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,240
What road is there to get

390
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,340
from the first site of the explosion to the Haido Park?

391
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,740
The road order of the parade of the Spirits!

392
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,840
Which means that the bomber is not after us, the police,

393
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,340
but carried out an extremely heinous prank

394
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,040
against the Tokyo Spirits.

395
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,940
Officer Sato.

396
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,240
Are you all right?

397
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,640
How's your hands?

398
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,640
I heard you got burns.

399
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,440
No problem. I can go!

400
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,040
Okay, we've figured out what the bomber is after!

401
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,140
Moreover, he may have set bombs up elsewhere too!

402
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,640
Get all the officers nearby

403
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,740
and go to the front of the course of the parade,

404
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,140
and evacuate the people in the vicinity!

405
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,540
Do what you can to take the suspect into custody,

406
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:08,340
then search for the bombs with all your might!

407
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,940
-On the double! -Yes, sir!

408
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,040
Just in case, Shiratori,

409
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,240
will you contact the bomb disposal crew

410
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,940
and have them stand by?

411
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,840
Yes, sir!

412
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,640
Officer Takagi, I want you to stay back here

413
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,940
and keep checking the video.

414
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,640
If you find anything, contact me immediately!

415
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,040
But I want to go to the site too.

416
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,640
You can't. You wait back here.

417
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,140
Officer Sato.

418
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,140
And I'd like to have a word with you later.

419
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,840
Strange.

420
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,140
What is the culprit after anyway?

421
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,940
Pretending to be the bomber of three years ago,

422
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,640
sending fax to headquarters,

423
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,240
and blowing up the car of the officer that is dispatched.

424
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,240
But, soon afterwards,

425
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,740
the culprit blows up a phone booth

426
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,140
that has nothing to do with the police.

427
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,240
I wonder if it's really only a prank

428
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,440
of bad taste towards the Spirits.

429
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,040
And, besides, this tape that Mitsuhiko took.

430
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,040
Is something that will point out the bomber

431
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,740
really filmed on it?

432
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,240
If so,

433
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,840
what was filmed?

434
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,880
-Next Conan's Hint: -Hold on.

435
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,740
"Mail truck"

436
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,500
The case and love are both solved in the next episode?

437
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:39,460
I don't think love worked out, did it?

438
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,210
I have a feeling this is going take till next year.
