1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,740
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,840
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,840
A soundless murder within the dark.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,840
A clean deduction of a messed up crime site.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,240
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,360
We all head over together with mom to the Tohto Processing Station

9
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,160
to watch the preview of the new movie, "Kamen Yaiba the Movie II".

10
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,860
However, it ends up that the preview that was scheduled

11
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,760
could only be shown late at night, so we had to wait.

12
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,660
Mom goes back to the U.S.

13
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,360
while we all go over to Mr. Akira Hojima's condo to take a nap.

14
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:35,460
"Secret of the Tohto Processing Station (Part 2)"

15
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,360
The victim is Mr. Norihiro Furumura, age 39.

16
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,760
He seems to have been employed at the Tohto Processing Station

17
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,260
located opposite this condo.

18
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,060
One stab through the chest with a knife.

19
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,360
He seems to have been stabbed from over the blanket

20
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,960
in order to avoid blood splattering onto the killer.

21
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,760
No.

22
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,260
They all just happened to come to take a short nap at my place.

23
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,660
We were planning to play all night mahjong

24
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,060
after the movie was completed tonight.

25
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,860
Movie?

26
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,160
Yes.

27
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,160
The preview showing of that movie was extended to around 11 pm,

28
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,560
so we all decided to take a short nap together,

29
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,760
including those children.

30
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,060
I see.

31
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,260
So, where were you all sleeping?

32
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,160
That room.

33
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,160
All five of us lined up sideways and slept on that bed.

34
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,060
Then, we heard a man shout.

35
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,060
When we opened the door and turned on the light,

36
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,660
this is what we saw.

37
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,460
I see.

38
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,460
But it's strange.

39
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,960
What's strange?

40
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,560
We didn't hear the murderer at all.

41
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,960
-That's because you were sleeping... -No.

42
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,160
But it's after Mr. Furumura was killed.

43
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,160
It's only natural that

44
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,960
we'd at least hear the sound of somebody leaving the room.

45
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,360
The killer probably tiptoed out.

46
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,560
Well, I think it's almost impossible

47
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,260
to run away in such a short time from this dark, messy room

48
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,660
without making a sound.

49
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,960
Which means that the killer

50
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,760
is the person who was sleeping next to the sofa

51
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
that the victim was sleeping on...

52
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,460
Mr. Hojima.

53
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,660
No way!

54
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,760
There were no signs of the door being forced open either.

55
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,360
Wait!

56
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,760
People other than me have the spare key to this room.

57
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,460
People who work at the same processing station as I,

58
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,760
like Mr. Karata and Mr. Negami.

59
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,660
What? Furumura was?

60
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,060
By who?

61
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,660
We'll soon find out after you all tell us about yourselves.

62
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,860
Will you please tell us

63
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,660
what you were doing and where you were

64
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,860
at the time of the murder around 10:55 pm?

65
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,160
At that time, since I was almost done with timing,

66
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,860
I left the rest of the work with another worker

67
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,860
and went to take a rest at the nap room.

68
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,760
Timing?

69
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,560
It involves adjusting the color for movies and dramas.

70
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,860
Can anyone verify that for you?

71
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,260
There were two to three other people there,

72
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,360
but they were all asleep.

73
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,460
And you?

74
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:10,960
I was alone in the dark room checking the film.

75
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,960
So, you both don't have an alibi?

76
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,260
No.

77
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,260
And? Will you explain why you had a spare key?

78
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,160
So that I could play mahjong right away.

79
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,860
The ones who finished work first would come here

80
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,360
and get the game set up and all.

81
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,760
But maybe we weren't the only ones who had the spare key.

82
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,460
He seemed to have other people he played mahjong with, too.

83
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,660
But the only people I gave my spare key to are those two

84
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,160
and Mr. Furumura.

85
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,760
But if you used to come here

86
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,460
and knew where everything was...

87
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,460
It could be possible to move around easily even in the dark.

88
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,360
But...

89
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,660
Conan?

90
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,960
See! This room is really pitch dark.

91
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,260
Hey, stop that! Don't interfere with the officers!

92
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,960
Yes, sir.

93
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,260
But Conan's right.

94
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,660
Right.

95
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,960
If it's that dark, no matter how used to you are to this place,

96
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,260
you're bound to bump into something.

97
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,560
Inspector, may I have a moment with you?

98
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,960
The 3rd button of the corpse's shirt has been yanked off.

99
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,960
It seems as if the victim has struggled with the killer

100
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,960
before he was stabbed.

101
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,060
His shirt sure is dirty though.

102
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,360
His collar is soiled black.

103
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,060
Mr. Furumura used to hate bathing

104
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,260
and used to take baths only once a week or so.

105
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,960
Come to think of it, when we played 3 days ago,

106
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,660
he was wearing this shirt, too.

107
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,060
Which means he hasn't changed since then.

108
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,860
I could never do something like this.

109
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,160
I could never struggle with him,

110
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,360
yank off his button or stab him in a pitch dark place like this!

111
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,060
But if you were the only one awake at that time,

112
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,460
you could've confirmed the position of the victim

113
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,360
with a flashlight or something

114
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,860
and approached him, couldn't you?

115
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,260
And besides, the children haven't heard the killer running away.

116
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,460
Or, did you hear the killer making any sound?

117
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,460
No. I was surprised at hearing Mr. Furumura's voice

118
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,360
that I noticed nothing else.

119
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,660
What's that?

120
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,360
Inspector! There's a video camera on the floor.

121
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,760
What's with this video camera?

122
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,660
This is the video diary that Furumura used to take every day.

123
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,660
Don't tell me the video was kept running all this time.

124
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,960
Okay. Connect it to the TV right away and play it.

125
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
There may be something it in

126
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,460
that would give us a clue to the murder.

127
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,660
Yes, sir!

128
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,360
Good work all day today!

129
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,360
I'm going to give my best shot playing all-night mahjong tonight.

130
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,160
I'll report the result later.

131
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,560
It's been switched off once here.

132
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,360
It switched back on again.

133
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,360
But it's pitch black and you can't see a thing.

134
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,760
-Inspector! -Yeah.

135
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,460
Hey, Mr, Furumura!

136
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,460
What's the matter? Mr. Furumura!

137
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,560
This is my voice!

138
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,160
That's the sound I made when I opened the bedroom door.

139
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,560
Mr. Furumura!

140
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,060
This is where this boy turned on the light.

141
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,160
But why did the video camera switch back on again?

142
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,660
The impact of the video camera falling to the floor

143
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,860
when he struggled with the killer

144
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,060
probably set it back on again.

145
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,860
The problem here though, is the sound.

146
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,460
Until the victim shouts,

147
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,660
Conan opens the door and Ayumi screams,

148
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:52,160
there is no sound other than your voice, Mr. Hojima.

149
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,160
Which means that...

150
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,260
No way!

151
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,460
If I was planning to do something like this,

152
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,260
I wouldn't have brought these children here to take a nap!

153
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,660
Besides, I have no reason to want to kill Mr. Furumura.

154
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,060
You do.

155
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,260
You had a grudge on him for spoiling your precious movie.

156
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,660
Oh, the last episode of the series, "Doting Parents' Diary".

157
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,960
The same goes for you, right, Mr. Negami?

158
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,460
You were really angry too, weren't you, Mr. Karata?

159
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,260
Well, it's true, but...

160
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,860
What do you mean? He spoiled your movie?

161
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,560
Well, when he was checking the film,

162
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,460
Furumura overlooked a scratch,

163
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,760
developed it the way it was and cut the film.

164
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,860
Because of it, we suffered a great loss.

165
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,660
We had to pay for all the retake of the scenes

166
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,160
that were no good after being cut.

167
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,660
But film checking is done in the dark room

168
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,660
and is tough work that is done virtually

169
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,560
by the sense of touch of the fingertips, so...

170
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,260
It was work that was too hard on him to begin

171
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,360
because he used to play mahjong till early morning almost every day.

172
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,260
Checking the film in the dark room...

173
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,160
Mr. Negami. Don't you do that, too?

174
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,660
Yes. He used to be a developer before, too.

175
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:05,760
After that incident, Furumura was switched over to sales.

176
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,560
I don't see why three of you need to hold a grudge against him, though?

177
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,260
Were your bonuses decreased, too?

178
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,860
That "Doting Parents' Diary" series

179
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,860
was the pride and joy of all of us working here.

180
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,560
It's only natural to hold a grudge against him

181
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,560
for damaging the final episode.

182
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,260
Mr. Furumura alone didn't seem too proud about it, though.

183
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,160
It's not that we held that much a grudge against him.

184
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,560
He was one of the members we played mahjong with, after all.

185
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,860
Most of us have forgotten about it already.

186
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,960
A soundless murder...

187
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,560
From that front door to this door...

188
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,560
Even if you were to be able to pass easily with no obstructions...

189
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,060
The toughest part would be this living room.

190
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,660
It's virtually impossible to go through here

191
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,660
in a short time without making a sound.

192
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,660
Then, the killer would have to be

193
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,460
Mr. Hojima, who was here to begin with?

194
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,260
Come to think of it! If I remember correctly...

195
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,360
I'm sure that...

196
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,960
That video camera was also...

197
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,260
I see. That's why he was flustered and did what he did.

198
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,860
If so, the unexplained thing about no noise on the video tape

199
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,760
and the button that was yanked off all fit in.

200
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,160
The killer is probably him.

201
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,960
The only one who could've committed the murder

202
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,160
in this pitch darkness is him.

203
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,760
But I don't have proof.

204
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,960
What now?

205
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,260
What do I do?

206
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,660
What's the matter, Ai?

207
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,860
You look dreadful.

208
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,360
It's nothing, really.

209
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,460
She says it's nothing.

210
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,560
Really?

211
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,860
Don't tell me that...

212
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,840
So, what we clearly know now is...

213
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,640
Mr. Furumura who was sleeping on the sofa around 11 pm

214
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,640
was stabbed to death by someone in the dark.

215
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,640
If the killer stabbed Mr. Furumura and fled,

216
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,640
he would've most naturally bumped into something and made noise.

217
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,940
But the children who were sleeping in the next room

218
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,640
heard no noise at all.

219
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,840
Moreover, the video camera

220
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,340
which seemed to have fallen to the floor and switched on

221
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,940
when the killer and Mr. Furumura was thought

222
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,740
to have struggled with each other

223
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,740
had no such sound recorded in it.

224
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,640
In other words, the killer is the one

225
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,340
who was sleeping next to the sofa where Mr. Furumura was sleeping,

226
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,540
Mr. Hojima.

227
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,240
You're the only one I can come up with.

228
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,840
Wait!

229
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,840
Absolutely!

230
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,340
Dr. Agasa?

231
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,840
Doc?

232
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,540
Conan called me to ask me to come pick him up.

233
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,040
I heard about the case on the phone.

234
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,040
No matter how much I think it over, I come up with just one answer!

235
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,340
That there is probably no doubt that Mr. Hojima committed the crime.

236
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,040
An ordinary person wouldn't be able

237
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,740
to move around in the dark without making a sound.

238
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,540
Maybe it'd be a different story

239
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,540
if you were a ninja or a ghost, though.

240
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,440
Dr. Agasa. You think so, too?

241
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,040
But there is just one thing that bothers me.

242
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,040
What?

243
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,340
Remember the third button of Mr. Furumura's shirt that was yanked off

244
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,340
when he struggled with the killer?

245
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,440
It hasn't been found yet, has it?

246
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,340
Now that you mentioned it, no.

247
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,640
Without it, it just doesn't feel good.

248
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,340
It couldn't be that the button had wings and flew off.

249
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,240
It's probably somewhere in this messy room

250
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,240
or the killer still has it on him.

251
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,740
I'd recommend you to do a thorough body check of Mr. Hojima

252
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,140
when you take him for questioning to the station.

253
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,040
Yes, I will.

254
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,640
Mr. Hojima, please come to the station with me.

255
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,440
All right. But I'm not the killer.

256
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,340
Then, Mr. Negami and Mr. Karata, let's go too.

257
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,340
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

258
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,040
Did I do okay?

259
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,640
Yeah, just great.

260
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,640
So, we'll go to the police station for questioning, too.

261
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,940
You all slept once, so you can all stay up, right?

262
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,340
Yes...

263
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,340
Hey, Ai. Let's go!

264
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,040
What? Yes.

265
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,740
But I really wanted to see Yaiba's movie.

266
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,540
-Very true. -Wait...

267
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,540
Let's all go see it together when it's released.

268
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,840
All right then.

269
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,640
Why?

270
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:09,540
Just as I thought. It was you after all, Mr. Negami.

271
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,140
Why?

272
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,840
Sound. It was the sound.

273
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,040
Sound?

274
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,740
But the children said they heard no sound,

275
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,740
the same with the video tape.

276
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:28,240
Right. It's true that there were no suspicious sounds.

277
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,440
But it was too soundless.

278
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,940
If the video camera dropped to the floor and switched on,

279
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,140
the sound back then of the video camera dropping

280
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,140
or the sound of the struggle should've been recorded.

281
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,740
But since it had no sound,

282
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:44,240
chances are, the killer deliberately pressed the record button

283
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,240
and put it on the floor.

284
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,840
It could be that the killer was confident of fleeing

285
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,040
from a dark room without making a sound.

286
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,440
And your job as a developer also made me suspect you.

287
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,640
Huh?

288
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,440
You seemed to have mentioned that

289
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,640
working as a developer requires one to check the scratches on the films

290
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,640
only with the sense of touch of the fingertips.

291
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,240
No matter how used to you are to the dark room,

292
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,540
it is impossible to work in a room with no light at all.

293
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,540
That's why I thought you would've had to place some kind of mark

294
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:20,740
in the room to help you locate things even in the dark.

295
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,440
And walla! I found it as soon as I entered this room.

296
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,240
Among all the things cluttered in this room, on every corner...

297
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,040
I found these black tapes.

298
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,240
What?

299
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:37,340
This probably is black vinyl tape pasted on over fluorescent tape.

300
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,540
See? There are tapes that have peeled off,

301
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:44,340
so the fluorescent tape under them are slightly showing.

302
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,340
Unless light is kept at a low level in this way,

303
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,140
the film in the darkroom would probably over expose.

304
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,440
So, an ordinary person can't see right away

305
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,040
when the lights are turned out.

306
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,540
But when their eyes get used to the dark,

307
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,540
they gradually start being able to see.

308
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,840
Using this light as a guide and walking carefully,

309
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,440
aware of where everything is located...

310
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,640
It's possible to go through without bumping into anything.

311
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,740
I happened to change the position of some things,

312
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,940
so you seemed to have panicked a bit this time.

313
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,940
That's why when Conan turned off the light,

314
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,240
you turned it right back on, right?

315
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,440
You did so because you didn't want others to get used to the dark

316
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,440
and realize what you had done.

317
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,040
Now that you mentioned it, there is black tape on this video camera, too.

318
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,740
Even if he could tell where the camera was,

319
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:34,240
would he be able to tell where the chest of a person who is asleep is?

320
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,440
If the body were to move even a bit,

321
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,040
it would be impossible to commit the crime.

322
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,840
The button.

323
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,640
He probably put a bit of fluorescent paint

324
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,640
on Mr. Furumura's 3rd button

325
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,540
to make out where the chest was even in the dark.

326
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,240
In other words, if you can get into the room with the spare key,

327
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,340
you can stab him in the chest even in the dark.

328
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,540
You must've painted the button 3 days ago

329
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:05,140
when you played mahjong all night and he was fast asleep.

330
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,040
Knowing that he only takes baths once a week,

331
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,540
it's very likely he wouldn't change shirts.

332
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,840
Then, you decided to bring back the button

333
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,240
after peeling off the fluorescent paint from it

334
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,740
because if someone finds it, the trick would be revealed.

335
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,440
On top of that, since you heard me say

336
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,540
it's strange that the button hasn't been found,

337
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:29,040
you returned the button after peeling off the fluorescent paint.

338
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,540
After Dr. Agasa explained everything to me,

339
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,940
finished questioning you first of all,

340
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,140
and was waiting here in this room,

341
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,740
but I didn't expect this outcome.

342
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:43,640
It's amazing how Mr. Furumura who worked as a developer like you,

343
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,440
didn't notice the fluorescent tapes.

344
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,540
Notice what?

345
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,040
These tapes were pasted on by Furumura himself.

346
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,640
What?

347
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,440
He told me that he pasted the tape onto the video camera

348
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,940
so that he could get a hold of it any time in the dark.

349
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,240
He said that he also pasted tape around the room

350
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,140
so that he could find the restroom if he needed to go late at night.

351
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,940
He did it as a prank and didn't let Hojima in on it.

352
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,340
I always knew that he was unreliable, though.

353
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,940
But I just couldn't forgive him for what he did back then.

354
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,140
When he damaged the film

355
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,740
of the final episode of the series "Doting Parents' Diary",

356
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,440
I just couldn't overlook his mistake!

357
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,240
But you did a retake and the movie was successfully completed, wasn't it?

358
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,340
No good. It wasn't perfect.

359
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,340
Because in the original film,

360
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,440
the younger brother of the star of the show was also acting in it.

361
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,440
But just before the retake, he died in a traffic accident.

362
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,140
So we had no choice but to do without him.

363
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:46,340
That's why that movie is not perfect or ever will be complete!

364
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,240
Just because of him!

365
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,740
He's to blame!

366
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,940
Doc, thanks for everything!

367
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,340
Hey, hold it.

368
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,540
Come back here then, will you?

369
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,640
Although it's a bit far,

370
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,040
run over here because it's good for your health.

371
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,540
Conan.

372
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,740
Don't worry.

373
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,840
That cigarette is like a car tooting its horn

374
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,640
waiting for the traffic light to change.

375
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,140
If you don't want them to be aware of our existence,

376
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,940
let's not toot our horns from our side.

377
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,540
The same with the condo they were watching.

378
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,340
From what we saw from that window, he was not smoking a cigarette.

379
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,640
If we saw the lit cigarette he was smoking,

380
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,740
it would be like we were telling him from our side that we are here.

381
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,340
It's the basics of a stake out.

382
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:11,140
But he just happened to be smoking a cigarette in our view.

383
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,740
It's only proof that he lost track of us.

384
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,740
Since he's still waiting around here,

385
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,040
it means that he probably doesn't have an idea of where we live, right?

386
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,240
I had Officer Takagi deliberately

387
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,040
go through a drunk driving checkpoint,

388
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,140
and bring us all the way here.

389
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,540
It's no wonder they lost track of us.

390
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,940
Don't tell me that they're...

391
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,040
Beats me.

392
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,940
The only thing I'm sure of is that he's not one of my mom's fans.

393
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:39,640
It seems that his target is either you or me.

394
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,440
So, we've lost track of them.

395
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,340
It's all right. The string hasn't been severed yet.

396
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,540
Keep it up.

397
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,940
But...

398
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,640
She sure resembles.

399
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,360
Next Conan's Hint:

400
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,780
"Receipt"
