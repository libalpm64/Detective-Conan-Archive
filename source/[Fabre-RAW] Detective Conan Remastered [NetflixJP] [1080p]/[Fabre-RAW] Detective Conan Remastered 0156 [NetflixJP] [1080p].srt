1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,810
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,610
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,710
In today's episode, a lot of police officer make their appearance.

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,610
The Youth Detective Squad prove to be an asset.

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,010
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,910
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,310
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,880
"Metropolitan Police Officer Love Story 2 (Part 1)"

9
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,950
There's no doubt about it,

10
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,750
she's beginning to suspect your true identity.

11
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,750
It's no use trying to keep it hidden from her any longer,

12
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,350
you'll only end up hurting her.

13
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,650
Why are you telling me this?

14
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,450
You mean you can read how a criminal thinks

15
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,750
but you can't read the heart of a woman's heart?

16
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,250
A woman's heart?

17
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,950
I'm in love with you.

18
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,150
I have been since the moment we met...

19
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,350
You didn't know that, did you?

20
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,050
Masked Yaiba?

21
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,150
Cut! Cut!

22
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,550
That won't do, Conan.

23
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,650
You've got to look more surprised.

24
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,950
This is the climactic scene

25
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,150
where the female spy who betrayed the underworld

26
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,050
confesses her love for Masked Yaiba!

27
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,050
Good grief. Isn't this supposed to be a school play?

28
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,850
Then let's do a normal story.

29
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,750
Like Momotaro or Issunboshi.

30
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,850
I can't direct something that lacks reality like those stories.

31
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,850
Masked Yaiba is just as bad.

32
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,850
I'm not happy as the Potato Giant

33
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,250
but I'm sticking it out!

34
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,750
Don't complain.

35
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,350
He's right.

36
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,250
After all, we snuck in this abandoned building

37
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,050
to create an air of suspense.

38
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,550
Then let's do a police story.

39
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,950
You know what I mean, don't you?

40
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,550
Where the criminal escapes into an abandoned building

41
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,950
and a shoot-out takes place...

42
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,950
Hold it!

43
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,050
Stop!

44
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,550
Put your hands up and don't make a move!

45
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,050
Officer Sato.

46
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,550
Ayumi!

47
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,950
Don't come near me.

48
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,650
-Ayumi! -Ayumi!

49
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,550
Don't... don't come near me.

50
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,950
Conan!

51
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,450
Let me go!

52
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,550
No.

53
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,050
Let me go! Let me go!

54
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,850
Sorry, little girl.

55
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,650
I must have scared you.

56
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,350
I'm really sorry.

57
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,550
Darn.

58
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,750
Ayumi!

59
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,050
-Conan. -Where is he?

60
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,750
I think he's out on the roof.

61
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,750
Let's go.

62
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,650
Hold it. I said to stop.

63
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,850
Amazing.

64
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,650
Officer Sato.

65
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,850
Officer Takagi.

66
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,150
Officer Sato!

67
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,250
Takagi. Go around and come in from below.

68
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,650
Right away!

69
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,650
Hey, what happened?

70
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,750
What? A prisoner escape?

71
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,750
Yes, that's right.

72
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,550
We were taking him to headquarters,

73
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,450
there was an accident involving a car and a motorcycle.

74
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,650
The suspect was sitting next to me

75
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,750
but my attention went to the accident

76
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,850
and when I turned back, he was gone.

77
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,050
He was a very quiet man,

78
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,150
I never thought he'd try to escape.

79
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,350
You blew it.

80
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,350
You let him escape,

81
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,650
you won't get off the hook by just filing a report, you know?

82
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,750
I know it.

83
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,650
6:43 pm,

84
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,850
escaped suspect is apprehended...

85
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,450
Oh no, the chain on the handcuffs cut.

86
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:01,250
What a bother, you're nothing but trouble.

87
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,850
Now then, get up.

88
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,450
I don't believe it.

89
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,050
The key! The key! Where's the key?

90
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,350
No. No, it's not here.

91
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,750
I bet I dropped it somewhere.

92
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,350
-I shouldn't have been so rough. -I'm innocent.

93
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,350
I'm innocent.

94
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,350
I didn't kill her, officer!

95
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,850
Hey, did you hear some kind of noise from upstairs?

96
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:37,950
It must be your imagination.

97
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,050
The place is locked up tight.

98
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,350
Come on. Let's get this job done.

99
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,250
Officer Sato, where are you?

100
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,650
Officer Sato.

101
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,650
Strange.

102
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,550
Isn't this an art museum?

103
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,550
Yes.

104
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,350
Then why aren't there any paintings?

105
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,950
You're right.

106
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,050
There're probably changing displays.

107
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,150
Listen here.

108
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,350
It's very dangerous didn't I tell you kids to go home.

109
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,650
Takagi.

110
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,850
Officer Sato?

111
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:08,850
Takagi.

112
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,250
Over here!

113
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,950
Officer Sato?

114
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,550
Officer Sato?

115
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,950
In here! Here!

116
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,350
What are you doing in there?

117
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,350
This is the men's room.

118
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,950
And what happened to the suspect?

119
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,550
I did manage to recapture him, but...

120
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,750
I sort of made a mistake.

121
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,750
What in the world did you do?

122
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,250
Isn't it normal procedure to handcuff the suspect's hands?

123
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,150
I didn't want him to get away again,

124
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,750
so I inadvertently handcuffed myself to him.

125
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,750
Where's the key?

126
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,350
I think I lost it.

127
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,950
If the other police officers hear about this,

128
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,150
I'd die of embarrassment

129
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,350
so could you please go get the spare and not tell anyone?

130
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,350
I wouldn't be able to get in and out unnoticed,

131
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,450
the entire station is in an uproar because of this escaped prisoner.

132
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,850
I see.

133
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,350
Is that any way to talk to a senior officer?

134
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,650
Besides, this entire situation occurred

135
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,550
when you took your eyes off the prisoner

136
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,850
and allowed him to get away, right?

137
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,950
Yes. You are absolutely correct.

138
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,350
Alright, get going Takagi.

139
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,550
Yes, ma'am.

140
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,850
I didn't do it.

141
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,350
I didn't kill her.

142
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,850
I don't know what happened

143
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,650
but when I woke in the morning, Ms. Muranishi was dead.

144
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,850
That's all he's been saying since before.

145
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,150
It's the truth! Please believe me!

146
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,750
Listen to me, Mr. Higashida.

147
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,650
The deceased is Mani Muranishi,

148
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,250
she lived in the same condominium building as you

149
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,850
"Masami Muranishi, Victim" -and she just happened to be your boss.

150
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,650
The crime was committed in her bathroom.

151
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,850
When her body was found,

152
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:37,150
you were stone drunk and asleep on her bed.

153
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,750
The front door was locked and chained from the inside.

154
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,650
The apartment was completely locked.

155
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,850
Besides, your fingerprints were on the door lock and chain

156
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:51,250
and even on the video cord we found around her neck.

157
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,850
On top of that, you always argued with her about work,

158
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,150
the night of the murder you told a friend

159
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,750
you were "Going to tell her off,"

160
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,750
then you rushed out to go home, isn't that so?

161
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,050
You were drunk, you went to her apartment

162
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,950
and killed her in the heat of the argument,

163
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,350
isn't that how it happened?

164
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,350
You locked the door so she couldn't run away

165
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,550
and after you killed her, you were so drunk.

166
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,850
You fell asleep on her bed, isn't that right?

167
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,650
But I don't remember anything.

168
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,450
That's because you were drunk out of your mind.

169
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:29,250
Yes, it's true I hated her for finding fault with every job I did.

170
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,850
But I didn't hate her enough to kill her.

171
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,350
Then why'd you try to escape?

172
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,050
There's someplace I have to be.

173
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,550
And where's that?

174
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,550
I have a daughter in Chicago.

175
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,150
My wife took her when we got divorced,

176
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,950
my daughter sent me a wedding invitation.

177
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:54,150
And for the past 17 years, I thought she hated me.

178
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,050
That's why I have to go, I have to.

179
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,450
It's the truth!

180
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,750
Go to my apartment,

181
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,650
you'll find the letter and the ticket.

182
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,650
But what can I do...

183
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,850
That man's not a bad man.

184
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,450
You know he let me go

185
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,750
and when he put me down, he said he was sorry.

186
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,750
If he was a bad man, he wouldn't do that.

187
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,650
But...

188
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,950
Listen. What time's the flight tomorrow?

189
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:27,250
It leaves Narita at 12:30 pm.

190
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,250
Officer Sato?

191
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,650
Takagi?

192
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,350
I want you to listen very carefully

193
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,950
to what I'm about to say to you.

194
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,150
"The Metropolitan Police Department" -What?

195
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,750
You can't contact Takagi and Sato?

196
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,850
No.

197
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,850
I've been trying to raise them on the cellular.

198
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,850
Something may have happened to them

199
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,150
while they were pursuing the suspect?

200
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:49,150
Find them! They should still be in that area!

201
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,350
Hey, Shiratori.

202
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,350
-We going along too. -Yes, sir.

203
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,850
What? Get the real killer by noon tomorrow?

204
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,450
Do you mean me?

205
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,950
Yes, that's right.

206
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,950
I'll keep an eye on this guy for you until then.

207
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,050
Besides, I'm not going anywhere for a while.

208
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,750
Alright then. I'll go get the key,

209
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,450
let's take him down to headquarters first,

210
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,150
then we both can go.

211
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,150
No.

212
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,550
If someone sees you at headquarters getting the key,

213
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,550
the boss will put you through the ringer,

214
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,650
while you're writing the report,

215
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,350
the plane will take off and it'll be too late.

216
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,350
Now listen,

217
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,950
we're still in pursuit of the escaped prisoner.

218
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,450
That's what we have to make it look like.

219
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,850
In the meantime, you will work alone and find the real killer.

220
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,550
That's our only alternative.

221
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,750
If the suspect is found not guilty

222
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,550
before he is delivered to the Public Prosecutor's Office,

223
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:40,950
the police department has the right to set him free at their discretion.

224
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,650
But...

225
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:46,050
The time limit is tomorrow morning

226
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,150
about 10 am when this art museum opens.

227
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,350
Because as soon as someone comes in here,

228
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,450
they're sure to call the police.

229
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,150
I'll believe you until then,

230
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,850
is that okay with you?

231
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,550
I really appreciate that!

232
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,450
But I don't know if I can do it all by myself.

233
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,350
Why? You aren't alone.

234
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,250
Those kids look anxious to help.

235
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,940
You got me?

236
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,240
The time limit is 10 am tomorrow.

237
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,240
You have until then to capture the real killer

238
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,240
and prove this man's innocence.

239
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,040
Don't worry, you can do it.

240
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,040
Have faith in yourself.

241
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,240
Hey, what're you doing?

242
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,440
We're going.

243
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,640
No, wait a minute.

244
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,740
I know Officer Sato's in tight with Inspector Megure,

245
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,540
she only said those things to encourage me.

246
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,040
His mood's been going up and down like a seesaw.

247
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,240
Weird.

248
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,840
Hey! What're you doing up there?

249
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,040
Didn't you see the sign down there?

250
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,340
It said no trespassing.

251
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,140
It was an emergency.

252
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,340
That's right. We're chasing a criminal.

253
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,840
Criminal, oh sure.

254
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,540
You're not the police.

255
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,940
I may not look it but I'm with...

256
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,840
Of course if anyone finds out

257
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,640
a police officer is here with an escaped murder suspect,

258
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,540
our efforts will have been for nothing.

259
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,140
In order for this man to make it to his daughter's wedding,

260
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,740
you have to work on your own and in secret.

261
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,540
Sorry about that,

262
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,340
we were just playing cops and robbers.

263
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,940
Good grief.

264
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,440
You think he'll be okay.

265
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,640
What?

266
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,640
That police officer didn't seen seem too reliable.

267
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,040
You're so right.

268
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,940
He seems so kind and somewhat clumsy,

269
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,940
the kind you just can't help worrying about.

270
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:51,140
But he's really quite dependable when he puts his mind to it.

271
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,740
Really?

272
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,240
Besides, that kid's with him...

273
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,540
That kid?

274
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,740
That kid wearing the glasses.

275
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,540
Somehow, that kid gives me hope.

276
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,480
"Yama Pub"

277
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,940
That's the fifth one.

278
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,840
I wonder what happened.

279
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,040
I told you.

280
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,040
They're looking for the killer, Officer Sato and me.

281
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,740
Officer Takagi, you look like a hoodlum.

282
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,940
It can't be helped, I doing some top secret investigating.

283
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,040
Anyway, we've got to go to that pub first.

284
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,340
That's where we'll start because Mr. Higashida said he stopped off there

285
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,140
just before the murder.

286
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,640
Yes, he was totally plastered.

287
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,840
He said "I'm going to tell that woman off once and for all today,"

288
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,040
but I never dreamed he'd kill her.

289
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,740
Was he alone when he left?

290
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,040
Mr. Kitagawa who was drinking with him took him home.

291
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,940
There, that's him.

292
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,240
He and Mr. Higashida work for the same company.

293
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,340
So he's same Kitagawa who first discovered the body.

294
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,740
He discovered the body?

295
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,840
Yes.

296
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,740
When Higashida and Ms. Muranishi didn't show up for work

297
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,840
the next morning.

298
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,440
He had the landlord use the master key to unlock the door.

299
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,540
That's how he found the body.

300
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,840
I'm leaving the money on the table.

301
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,940
Thank you.

302
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,740
Oh, Mr. Kitagawa!

303
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,040
I'm with the police.

304
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,040
I have a few questions for you.

305
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,340
I already told the police everything.

306
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,140
I'm in a state of shock,

307
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,440
my friend killed our boss.

308
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,940
Please leave me alone.

309
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,840
Of course.

310
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,940
He's right.

311
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,140
He's already been questioned by the police.

312
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,540
So has the pub's owner, probably several times.

313
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,840
That's right! Ms. Muranishi was Tokyo Spirits fan

314
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,040
and Mr. Higashida was anti-Spirits!

315
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,340
You there! What're you think you're doing?

316
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,140
I'm terribly sorry, we'll be going now.

317
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,240
I've got to call home. My mom will be worried.

318
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,340
-Me too. -Me too!

319
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,440
Good grief,

320
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,740
I never be able to get the real killer

321
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,740
by noon tomorrow at this rate.

322
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,740
"Dr. Agasa's House" -What?

323
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,340
You want me to pretend you're all spending the night here?

324
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,040
No, I don't mind.

325
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,140
If Officer Takagi is with you, I'm not worried.

326
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,340
Tomorrow's Sunday, the big day.

327
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,440
I'll just tell your parents

328
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,840
you're all coming with me to tomorrow's event.

329
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,140
Event? What event?

330
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,540
Tomorrow's the day my invention will serve our town.

331
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,240
I call it Tropical Rainbow.

332
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,940
When it blows, it glows like a rainbow.

333
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,340
When you're done with what you're doing, come have a look.

334
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,740
Sure thing.

335
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,940
Did Doctor Agasa say he'd do it?

336
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,740
Yes, he was pretty excited

337
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,240
about a fireworks display they're holding in Haido tomorrow.

338
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,340
Fireworks?

339
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,340
I didn't hear anything about that.

340
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,340
Never mind that,

341
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,340
next we go to the victim's apartment, right?

342
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,840
Right.

343
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,940
The police again?

344
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,740
The officers who came in the afternoon just left.

345
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,940
Yes, well...

346
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,740
There's something they forgot to check.

347
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,940
Who're those kids?

348
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,040
This is a social studies project.

349
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,640
We're experiencing police work

350
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,140
and then reporting to the class.

351
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,340
"Muranishi" -I know, you're studying jobs and the people doing then.

352
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,340
I'll return the key to you later then.

353
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,240
Yes, I'd appreciate it.

354
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,740
Oh, hey!

355
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,540
If you touch things, your...

356
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,440
Don't worry, look.

357
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,140
While you were buying your hat,

358
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,140
we bought these gloves.

359
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,540
Conan told us to.

360
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,040
I see.

361
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,340
Good grief.

362
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,140
Where in the world is the suspect and Officers Sato and Takagi?

363
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,840
It seems he lost contact with them when they entered an abandoned building

364
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,640
in pursuit of the escaped prisoner.

365
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,040
Don't you find that strange?

366
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,940
It's not like Officer Sato to not call in for so long.

367
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,540
You don't think...

368
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,840
They could be lying dead, killed by their prisoner.

369
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,040
No!

370
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,040
How awful.

371
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,740
Why you... How dare you kill my valuable subordinates!

372
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,740
Officer Sato?

373
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,840
That? The suspect has Officer Sato?

374
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,840
Ms. Miwa's being kept hostage?

375
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,140
Oh no. Am I coming down with a cold?

376
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,840
I'm sorry, it's my fault that we're caught up like this.

377
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,940
Forget it.

378
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,340
If we made a false arrest, we'd have to apologize to you.

379
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,840
Besides, this isn't for you.

380
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,540
I just didn't want your daughter to go through what I did.

381
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:57,640
I lost my father when I was little, it broke my heart.

382
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,840
Come on, kids, let's go home.

383
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,840
We're not going to come up with anything no matter how hard we look.

384
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,240
The guys from the crime lab were already here,

385
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,740
there isn't a single piece of trash on the floor.

386
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,640
There are four things out of place.

387
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,240
The first is, the color of the mattress,

388
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,940
the sheets, the pillow and the curtain beside the bed.

389
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,640
Everything from the kitchenware,

390
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,140
to the dishes down to the interior is in beige.

391
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,240
Why then is only the bed and curtain in gray?

392
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,640
I suppose it's just coincidence.

393
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,340
But there were beige sheets and curtains in the closet.

394
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,940
And the lady who ran the pub told us

395
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,640
Ms. Muranishi just loved beige.

396
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,440
And she also told us Ms. Muranishi liked the Spirits and cactus.

397
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,740
She also said Mr. Higashida knew a lot about video equipment

398
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,740
and hated baths.

399
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,740
And that when he got drunk, he always fell asleep

400
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,440
and couldn't wake up, that's why he was late for work a lot.

401
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
I don't think she told the investigators that

402
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,540
when they questioned her.

403
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,540
When people are being questioned by the police,

404
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,640
they are afraid that if they mention something unrelated to the crime,

405
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,740
they will be reprimanded.

406
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,340
But the tension sometimes makes them talk anyway.

407
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,940
She may not have appeared like it but I think she was scared.

408
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,540
Scared?

409
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,640
The second thing is, why was this calendar

410
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,440
taken off the wall next to the bed?

411
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,940
See, this is this year's Tokyo Spirits calendar, it was in the closet.

412
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,340
It matches the spot on the wall perfectly.

413
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,040
She probably took it down

414
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,040
because the team's not doing so good lately.

415
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,840
But look.

416
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,040
Her whole schedule until December is written in.

417
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,340
You're right.

418
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,440
The third thing is,

419
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,240
there're slight traces the furniture's been moved.

420
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,540
The men from the crime lab mentioned that too,

421
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,640
they said she'd probably rearranged the room.

422
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,540
But don't you think it's strange

423
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,740
she wouldn't notice she'd crushed something this valuable

424
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,040
when she moved the chest?

425
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,540
It's just a box of matches.

426
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,540
Open it up.

427
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,740
There's a piece of paper inside.

428
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,640
Why this is?

429
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,940
It's her marriage registration.

430
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,140
She was going to be married.

431
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,540
But the groom's name hasn't been filled in.

432
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,040
His seal is on it though.

433
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,040
The fourth thing is the cactus.

434
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,040
On the day of the murder,

435
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,040
it had been raining heavily since morning.

436
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,840
Would a cactus lover such as herself leave the pots outside?

437
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,440
Which means someone besides the victim

438
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,040
moved things around for some unknown reason.

439
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,140
Yes, here it is.

440
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,740
This is the gold dolphin cactus the pub owner gave her

441
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,040
on the day she was killed.

442
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,240
But the thorns have been bent, poor thing.

443
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,140
So what does that have to do with anything?

444
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,040
The suspect, Mr.Higashida

445
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,640
was found sleeping on the bed in this room

446
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,940
sprawled out like it was his home.

447
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,940
His fingerprints were found not only on the video cord,

448
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,540
which was the murder weapon,

449
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:58,640
but also on the door lock and even the chain lock.

450
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,240
No, it can't be...

451
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,840
You don't mean, this room?

452
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,340
Shall we go check it out then?

453
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,540
His apartment is in this condominium too, isn't it?

454
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,540
Yes, let's go.
