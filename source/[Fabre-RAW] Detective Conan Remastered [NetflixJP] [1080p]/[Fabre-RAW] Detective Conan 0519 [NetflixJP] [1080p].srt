1
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:04,452
The start of the age of mystery.

2
00:00:04,452 --> 00:00:06,552
The detective show on Monday at 7.

3
00:00:06,552 --> 00:00:07,987
The treasure hunt became a big case.

4
00:00:08,152 --> 00:00:10,952
What will happen to the kidnapped Haibara and Mitsuhiko?

5
00:00:10,952 --> 00:00:12,452
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:14,352
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,352 --> 00:00:16,652
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:52,447 --> 00:01:54,447
At the Shouin Shrine in Tokyo,

9
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,747
we rescued Kimiko Kobayakawa

10
00:01:55,747 --> 00:01:58,647
from a man attacked her.

11
00:01:58,647 --> 00:02:01,247
In order to search for "The treasure that could buy a country"

12
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:03,847
that her deceased grandfather was said to possess.

13
00:02:03,847 --> 00:02:06,847
We went to Tsuwano, Kimiko's family home.

14
00:02:08,847 --> 00:02:10,847
On the way, at Shin-Yamaguchi Station,

15
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:14,113
we ran into Kimiko's friend, Shigeru Kawaguchi.

16
00:02:14,113 --> 00:02:15,647
However, Haibara and I noticed that

17
00:02:15,647 --> 00:02:18,117
he was assuming a false name.

18
00:02:20,147 --> 00:02:23,247
At Tsuwano, we discovered a new riddle

19
00:02:23,247 --> 00:02:25,047
and an old map of the town of Hagi.

20
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:28,847
As well as a picture of a cat drawn in the diary.

21
00:02:28,847 --> 00:02:31,647
In search for clues, we went to visit Hagi.

22
00:02:31,647 --> 00:02:33,247
I witnessed Shigeru

23
00:02:33,247 --> 00:02:37,447
meeting the men who attacked Kimiko in Tokyo.

24
00:02:37,447 --> 00:02:40,147
And finally, those mysterious men made their move.

25
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:49,447
"The Meiji Restoration Mystery Tour: Deciphering Chapter"

26
00:02:50,147 --> 00:02:53,447
-Horrible people. -What should we do?

27
00:02:53,447 --> 00:02:56,447
What we should do is to notify the police!

28
00:02:56,447 --> 00:03:00,159
That's right, didn't someone say that the police was coming?

29
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,547
That voice.

30
00:03:01,547 --> 00:03:03,947
Police! This way! Come quick!

31
00:03:05,047 --> 00:03:08,547
I'm Shigeru Kawaguchi. Kimiko's friend!

32
00:03:09,547 --> 00:03:11,747
That was unmistakably his voice that we heard.

33
00:03:13,047 --> 00:03:15,247
It's from Ms. Kimiko's phone!

34
00:03:15,247 --> 00:03:16,647
Put it on speakerphone!

35
00:03:16,647 --> 00:03:17,947
Okay.

36
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,847
Press this button and...

37
00:03:19,847 --> 00:03:21,247
Can you hear me?

38
00:03:21,247 --> 00:03:23,247
We have the girl and kids here.

39
00:03:23,247 --> 00:03:25,847
Find the treasure now.

40
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:29,247
If you delay, you know what will happen to them, right?

41
00:03:29,247 --> 00:03:30,447
You!

42
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:34,193
Do not notify the police. Will contact you again.

43
00:03:35,547 --> 00:03:36,747
Hello?

44
00:03:36,747 --> 00:03:39,947
Ms. Kimiko? Hello?

45
00:03:42,447 --> 00:03:44,203
We have to call the police!

46
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:47,547
We can't! If we do, they might harm them.

47
00:03:47,547 --> 00:03:49,647
But there's no guarantee of their safety

48
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:52,211
just because we obey them either.

49
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:53,847
I understand.

50
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:56,847
Conan.

51
00:03:56,847 --> 00:04:00,219
Mitsuhiko threw this before he got caught.

52
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:01,847
Mitsuhiko.

53
00:04:03,947 --> 00:04:06,225
I see! I got it!

54
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:09,047
If you put this picture of the cat and the old map of Hagi...

55
00:04:09,047 --> 00:04:11,747
When you turn over the map onto this...

56
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:14,233
They are the same shape!

57
00:04:14,447 --> 00:04:15,847
Wow!

58
00:04:15,847 --> 00:04:19,347
This cat is representing the map of Hagi.

59
00:04:19,347 --> 00:04:24,243
And to "Reflect the castle in the eye of the cat" means...

60
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:27,247
place the cat eye and the position of the castle..

61
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:29,347
And the hole in the picture of the cat

62
00:04:29,347 --> 00:04:31,747
should tell us where to go next!

63
00:04:32,747 --> 00:04:34,247
I see!

64
00:04:34,247 --> 00:04:36,255
If we go here, we should be able to solve

65
00:04:36,255 --> 00:04:39,047
what it means by "look under the mouse"!

66
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:41,747
Mr. Mouri! I have notified the police!

67
00:04:41,747 --> 00:04:47,947
Mr. Kikkawa, can you tell us where this is in Hagi?

68
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:49,247
Look here!

69
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:52,271
This is...

70
00:04:52,447 --> 00:04:53,947
Enseiji Temple!

71
00:04:53,947 --> 00:04:56,547
Then Enseiji Temple is where we're going!

72
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:59,247
We have to hurry.

73
00:04:59,247 --> 00:05:01,547
"On November 30th,"

74
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:06,047
"only then, the sunset will show the truth of the treasure."

75
00:05:06,047 --> 00:05:08,287
We only have until sunset!

76
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:12,747
You can take those off now.

77
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:17,047
I will tell you though, nobody can hear you from here.

78
00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:19,447
Now stay there and don't try anything!

79
00:05:24,747 --> 00:05:30,309
Stay here? They're really thinking we are just a couple of kids.

80
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:34,847
That's so true. We don't give up that easily.

81
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:40,047
-Conan? -Mitsuhiko?

82
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:42,047
You can hear me?

83
00:05:42,047 --> 00:05:43,347
Mitsuhiko!

84
00:05:43,347 --> 00:05:44,323
Is everyone all right?

85
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:46,325
They haven't done anything to you, I hope!

86
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:48,347
We are all okay.

87
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,329
We're in an underground.

88
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:51,947
What are you hiding there?

89
00:05:51,947 --> 00:05:53,947
-Mitsuhiko! -What's going on?

90
00:05:53,947 --> 00:05:55,847
Mitsuhiko!

91
00:05:57,847 --> 00:06:00,339
Seems like someone needs to be taught a lesson!

92
00:06:01,647 --> 00:06:04,747
Mitsuhiko! Mitsuhiko!

93
00:06:04,747 --> 00:06:07,047
We lost contact.

94
00:06:07,047 --> 00:06:09,447
You did contact the police, right?

95
00:06:09,447 --> 00:06:11,547
Yes.

96
00:06:13,847 --> 00:06:15,647
This is Enseiji Temple.

97
00:06:15,647 --> 00:06:20,359
People such as Hirobumi Ito and Shinsaku Takasugi studied here.

98
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:22,747
"Look under the mouse."

99
00:06:22,747 --> 00:06:24,363
What does it mean?

100
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:26,747
Wow! Look at that mask!

101
00:06:26,747 --> 00:06:28,747
It's scary-looking!

102
00:06:30,547 --> 00:06:31,647
What is it?

103
00:06:31,647 --> 00:06:34,373
I found it! Right here!

104
00:06:35,347 --> 00:06:37,247
I see a mouse!

105
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:39,847
The animals that represent the Chinese zodiac are decorated here.

106
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:43,847
I see, so it should be underneath here.

107
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:45,947
Under here?

108
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,947
I don't see anything.

109
00:06:47,947 --> 00:06:51,547
Well, Kimiko's grandfather loved to play with words.

110
00:06:51,547 --> 00:06:54,393
Maybe there is another twist to this.

111
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:56,395
"Mouse" is also similar to "Mouth."

112
00:06:56,647 --> 00:06:59,347
That's it!

113
00:06:59,347 --> 00:07:01,047
Mouth!

114
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:05,047
That means the treasure should be inside the mouth of this.

115
00:07:05,047 --> 00:07:08,947
Oh, it says under, so it might be this?

116
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:15,947
I see. This is it.

117
00:07:19,447 --> 00:07:20,447
What are those?

118
00:07:20,447 --> 00:07:23,047
Those are the largest stone lantern in the prefecture.

119
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:25,247
The amazing thing is that some of the stones

120
00:07:25,247 --> 00:07:28,427
holding up the lanterns are able to move around.

121
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:30,147
Got it.

122
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:34,947
-I found it. -Wow! You did it!

123
00:07:34,947 --> 00:07:37,647
How did you figure it out?

124
00:07:37,647 --> 00:07:39,847
That opening in the top of the lanterns are called "Higuchi"

125
00:07:39,847 --> 00:07:41,747
which means "Fire Mouth".

126
00:07:41,747 --> 00:07:45,847
I see, so this means "Under the mouth" as well.

127
00:07:45,847 --> 00:07:49,147
And, what's this time?

128
00:07:49,147 --> 00:07:50,447
This is...

129
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:52,147
What is this?

130
00:07:52,147 --> 00:07:53,947
Another puzzle?

131
00:07:53,947 --> 00:07:58,457
Wait. I've seen this before in the diary.

132
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:00,247
Look.

133
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:04,463
This paper was torn off from this diary.

134
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:09,447
Then these two pages are the next puzzle.

135
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:13,347
"Make the map in the cave where the water goblin lives."

136
00:08:13,347 --> 00:08:17,947
There is only one cave that they say the water goblin lives.

137
00:08:17,947 --> 00:08:19,947
You mean, they are real?

138
00:08:19,947 --> 00:08:22,147
It's the Akiyoshi Cave.

139
00:08:23,247 --> 00:08:25,747
So you know where the treasure is?

140
00:08:25,747 --> 00:08:28,247
Are all three of them safe?

141
00:08:28,247 --> 00:08:29,947
Do you know where the treasure is?

142
00:08:29,947 --> 00:08:33,147
Let us hear their voices first!

143
00:08:33,147 --> 00:08:37,547
So you do not care if you cannot hear their voices ever again.

144
00:08:41,247 --> 00:08:43,247
It's the Akiyoshi Cave.

145
00:08:45,647 --> 00:08:46,947
Hurry!

146
00:08:46,947 --> 00:08:49,047
We don't have time!

147
00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:51,047
Akiyoshi Cave is said to be

148
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:54,513
one of the largest limestone caves in Orient.

149
00:08:57,447 --> 00:08:59,347
The sun is setting soon.

150
00:08:59,347 --> 00:09:00,519
Let's go!

151
00:09:03,547 --> 00:09:06,525
"Make the map in the cave."

152
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:08,527
So there should be some hints in this cave

153
00:09:08,747 --> 00:09:10,847
that would help us complete the map.

154
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:13,547
This is the "Ao-Tenjo" area.

155
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:16,047
The light coming from outside reflects on the water

156
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:18,847
and makes the ceiling blue.

157
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,047
What's this place?

158
00:09:20,047 --> 00:09:22,541
It says, "Nagabuchi".

159
00:09:22,747 --> 00:09:24,847
"Hyakumaizara".

160
00:09:24,847 --> 00:09:27,147
It really does look like a hundred plates!

161
00:09:27,147 --> 00:09:30,549
Just like the name! They're so interesting.

162
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:32,247
Hyakumaizara.

163
00:09:32,247 --> 00:09:35,147
Nagabuchi. Ao-Tenjo.

164
00:09:35,147 --> 00:09:38,147
Ao and Hyaku.

165
00:09:38,147 --> 00:09:39,647
I get it!

166
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:41,247
What is it?

167
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,561
Look.

168
00:09:44,247 --> 00:09:46,947
We take these apart.

169
00:09:46,947 --> 00:09:48,567
What are you doing?

170
00:09:48,747 --> 00:09:50,569
This is how it's supposed to be.

171
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:52,571
Look closely!

172
00:09:52,747 --> 00:09:54,573
See the letters on the top left corner?

173
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:56,347
-Yeah. -Well, these are

174
00:09:56,347 --> 00:10:00,347
all the first letter of the areas inside the Akiyoshi Cave.

175
00:10:00,347 --> 00:10:02,847
See, this one is "Ao" from the "Ao-Tenjo" area, meaning "Blue".

176
00:10:02,847 --> 00:10:04,847
This is "Naga" from "Nagabuchi", meaning "Long".

177
00:10:04,847 --> 00:10:08,147
This means the Hyakumaizara area.

178
00:10:08,147 --> 00:10:10,589
Look at the rest too!

179
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:13,147
Yes, you are correct.

180
00:10:13,147 --> 00:10:16,595
And from there it goes from "Dounaifuji", "Kabocyaiwa",

181
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:21,247
"Oomatsutake", "Subogaki", "Chirimeniwa".

182
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:23,447
Those are the famous places in order.

183
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:26,247
So, if we put these pieces of papers

184
00:10:26,247 --> 00:10:29,347
in order from the entrance...

185
00:10:29,347 --> 00:10:31,747
What's going to happen?

186
00:10:31,747 --> 00:10:33,447
See!

187
00:10:33,447 --> 00:10:36,615
It's a map of a cave.

188
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:40,619
The "X" mark should be where the treasure is!

189
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:43,247
Look at the message here.

190
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:46,625
It says, "Wainori."

191
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,647
Actually, this one you read from right to left.

192
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:50,347
I see.

193
00:10:50,347 --> 00:10:56,147
Kuroka, radetefu, tagonori, yuuki,

194
00:10:56,147 --> 00:11:02,147
tsunei, wanokuchi, sakihika, rinoiwa?

195
00:11:02,147 --> 00:11:05,147
It says, "Out from the black, the twin dragons,"

196
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:08,647
"on the tip of the foxes mouth, in the rock of light".

197
00:11:08,847 --> 00:11:13,147
"Out of the black" should be...

198
00:11:13,147 --> 00:11:15,247
Kurotaniguchi.

199
00:11:15,247 --> 00:11:19,947
Kuro of "Kurotaniguchi" as in black, huh?

200
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:23,647
Then what is the "Twin dragons"?

201
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:25,047
Hey!

202
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:26,247
Do you know anywhere

203
00:11:26,247 --> 00:11:28,947
that has two waterfalls lined up next to each other?

204
00:11:28,947 --> 00:11:30,947
Two waterfalls?

205
00:11:30,947 --> 00:11:34,673
There is one place halfway through the mountain here.

206
00:11:34,847 --> 00:11:37,147
So that's what the twin dragons are about!

207
00:11:37,147 --> 00:11:38,677
Then, right close to that.

208
00:11:38,847 --> 00:11:41,247
We can find the fox rock!

209
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:42,681
Hurry!

210
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:44,683
Mr. Kikkawa!

211
00:11:44,847 --> 00:11:46,685
Can I borrow that cell phone?

212
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:49,447
Sure. Of course.

213
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:51,747
But whom are you calling now?

214
00:11:51,747 --> 00:11:56,247
It's better to wait. Sorry about that, thank you.

215
00:11:56,247 --> 00:11:58,697
It's okay.

216
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:09,592
This must be the twin dragons.

217
00:12:09,592 --> 00:12:14,713
Then all we have to do is look for a fox-shaped rock!

218
00:12:14,892 --> 00:12:18,392
But I don't see it anywhere.

219
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:20,719
Where could it be?

220
00:12:29,392 --> 00:12:31,092
Over there.

221
00:12:31,092 --> 00:12:33,492
Huh? Where is it?

222
00:12:33,492 --> 00:12:37,092
That rock? But it doesn't look like a fox.

223
00:12:37,092 --> 00:12:40,292
-The shadow. -The shadow?

224
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:44,743
Oh! It's a fox!

225
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:47,292
I see! It wasn't about the shape of the rock,

226
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:49,492
but the shape of the shadow!

227
00:12:49,492 --> 00:12:51,792
And on the tip of its mouth.

228
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:54,192
That over there is the "Rock of Light".

229
00:12:57,092 --> 00:13:00,759
There is a mirror inside this rock.

230
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:03,192
It has to be this day of the year

231
00:13:03,192 --> 00:13:05,492
to have the sun exactly shine into the mirror.

232
00:13:05,492 --> 00:13:07,992
Let's move this rock!

233
00:13:11,492 --> 00:13:13,692
The treasure should be inside here.

234
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:16,292
Yes, no doubt about it.

235
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,692
Genta, Ayumi, be careful!

236
00:13:23,692 --> 00:13:26,092
Leave it to us!

237
00:13:26,092 --> 00:13:28,392
The path breaks off into two directions.

238
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:29,992
Take a right.

239
00:13:29,992 --> 00:13:32,592
Another right.

240
00:13:32,592 --> 00:13:34,092
And another right.

241
00:13:34,092 --> 00:13:37,292
Then left, and left.

242
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:40,392
Okay, right, right, right, and left, left!

243
00:13:40,392 --> 00:13:44,292
Right, right, right, and left, left!

244
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:46,792
Why are you yelling?

245
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:50,292
I'm sorry, I got a little excited.

246
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:52,292
Next should be this way.

247
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:53,792
Almost there.

248
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,592
We turned left and...

249
00:13:56,592 --> 00:13:58,292
What?

250
00:13:58,292 --> 00:13:59,692
What is this place?

251
00:13:59,692 --> 00:14:02,492
It's beautiful!

252
00:14:02,492 --> 00:14:04,823
This is where the treasure is!

253
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:07,792
This light must be from the moon

254
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:10,829
that's coming through the cracks of the ceiling.

255
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:14,092
How romantic.

256
00:14:14,092 --> 00:14:16,492
Conan! Where is the treasure?

257
00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:18,292
Right there!

258
00:14:21,992 --> 00:14:23,892
Found it!

259
00:14:23,892 --> 00:14:25,692
I'm opening it!

260
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:28,847
-We found it! -Yeah!

261
00:14:29,092 --> 00:14:31,192
Not so fast!

262
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:33,392
Good job. All of you.

263
00:14:33,392 --> 00:14:35,692
Ai! Mitsuhiko!

264
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:37,592
Are you both all right?

265
00:14:37,592 --> 00:14:40,492
Yes! We're both fine!

266
00:14:40,492 --> 00:14:42,492
Hand over the treasure.

267
00:14:42,492 --> 00:14:45,292
Then I'll release all of them!

268
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:48,867
-Ms. Kimiko! -Hurry up!

269
00:14:57,092 --> 00:14:58,892
Dad!

270
00:14:58,892 --> 00:15:01,992
Why don't you stop acting like a criminal?

271
00:15:01,992 --> 00:15:05,492
You are disturbing the scenery here.

272
00:15:05,492 --> 00:15:07,192
Mr. Mouri.

273
00:15:07,192 --> 00:15:10,892
Why don't you come out from hiding, Shigeru?

274
00:15:10,892 --> 00:15:12,192
What?

275
00:15:19,592 --> 00:15:23,292
Wha... what are you doing here?

276
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:24,903
Shigeru?

277
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:31,392
I believe that is not your real name.

278
00:15:31,392 --> 00:15:34,913
Your pendant and Ms. Kimiko's cell phone strap is the same,

279
00:15:35,092 --> 00:15:37,392
with your initials engraved in it.

280
00:15:37,392 --> 00:15:40,192
It is "K.K" on Ms. Kimiko's strap.

281
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:43,792
But yours says "A.T".

282
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:46,692
And also, you had no problem

283
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:50,929
of getting those rare tickets for the train.

284
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:52,492
So I suspected you have very strong connections

285
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:54,933
with the powerful people in the area.

286
00:15:55,092 --> 00:15:57,992
Also, the man who was giving a speech in front of the station.

287
00:15:57,992 --> 00:15:59,792
Hisamichi Takahashi.

288
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,992
He was an influential person in the area,

289
00:16:01,992 --> 00:16:04,192
announcing has candidacy for the prefectural assembly.

290
00:16:04,192 --> 00:16:05,892
And...

291
00:16:05,892 --> 00:16:09,492
To think such a splendid father could have a son like that...

292
00:16:09,492 --> 00:16:12,292
Atsushi, right?

293
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:16,955
The son of Hisamichi Takahashi is named Atsushi.

294
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:20,292
"Atsushi Takahashi".

295
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:22,961
So his initials would be "A.T."

296
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:25,992
You definitely live up to the name of detective.

297
00:16:25,992 --> 00:16:28,967
I'm Atsushi Takahashi.

298
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:33,492
You were trying to stop these people, weren't you?

299
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,192
When Ms. Kimiko and the others were taken.

300
00:16:36,192 --> 00:16:38,692
Police! This way! Hurry!

301
00:16:38,692 --> 00:16:41,692
That was you, wasn't it?

302
00:16:41,692 --> 00:16:46,985
That's right. It's out in the open now.

303
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:50,492
Give up, Father!

304
00:16:50,492 --> 00:16:52,692
You idiot!

305
00:16:56,995 --> 00:16:58,392
Hey, isn't that...

306
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,792
That person who was making the speech.

307
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:03,592
When Atsushi knew what his father

308
00:17:03,592 --> 00:17:07,592
was trying to do to Ms. Kimiko, he tried to stop it.

309
00:17:07,592 --> 00:17:11,392
Yeah. I just heard about that yesterday.

310
00:17:11,392 --> 00:17:13,691
It doesn't matter if it gets a little rough,

311
00:17:13,691 --> 00:17:16,292
we have to get that no matter what!

312
00:17:16,292 --> 00:17:20,492
And to tell her that, I went to Shin-Yamaguchi Station.

313
00:17:22,092 --> 00:17:25,023
Why did you do such a thing?

314
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:26,792
Of course he would!

315
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:29,392
He did it to protect Ms. Kimiko.

316
00:17:29,392 --> 00:17:31,392
What?

317
00:17:31,392 --> 00:17:35,592
Ms. Kimiko was very aware of the surroundings at the station.

318
00:17:35,592 --> 00:17:37,992
As though she didn't want anyone

319
00:17:37,992 --> 00:17:41,039
to see her with him.

320
00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:44,392
If someone knew about us,

321
00:17:44,392 --> 00:17:46,192
we wouldn't be able to see each other.

322
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:47,692
Of course!

323
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,792
That family has all the treasure of this land!

324
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:53,051
I am different from the Kobayakawa family!

325
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:56,192
I am going to use money to develop this town,

326
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:58,092
for it to prosper!

327
00:17:58,092 --> 00:18:02,392
Shut up! For that purpose, you even kidnapped kids!

328
00:18:02,392 --> 00:18:04,792
Let them go then!

329
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,065
There. Go ahead.

330
00:18:08,492 --> 00:18:10,092
Father?

331
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:13,492
Atsushi.

332
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,073
Kimiko.

333
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:22,592
Mr. Kikkawa! What are you doing?

334
00:18:22,592 --> 00:18:23,892
Mr. Kikkawa?

335
00:18:23,892 --> 00:18:26,192
So it was you,

336
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:29,592
who told Mr. Takahashi about this treasure.

337
00:18:29,592 --> 00:18:32,592
Conan has looked into your cell phone.

338
00:18:32,592 --> 00:18:36,692
He says he did not see any call made to the police.

339
00:18:36,692 --> 00:18:41,099
And also you were shouting the directions out loud.

340
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:45,103
So Mr. Takahashi and the others can hear you.

341
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47,105
No.

342
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:49,892
Ms. Kimiko, I am so sorry.

343
00:18:49,892 --> 00:18:52,492
My son failed in the stock market,

344
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:54,592
and he has huge debt with a financial company

345
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:57,115
under the Takahashi Group.

346
00:18:57,115 --> 00:18:59,392
He promised me that he would write off that debt

347
00:18:59,392 --> 00:19:01,119
if I listened to him.

348
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,123
I am very, very sorry.

349
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:07,492
Mr. Kikkawa.

350
00:19:07,492 --> 00:19:09,492
What? This can't be!

351
00:19:09,492 --> 00:19:15,592
This cannot be the treasure!

352
00:19:15,592 --> 00:19:17,592
This is unbelievable!

353
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:23,592
It's a letter

354
00:19:23,592 --> 00:19:27,492
that the ancestors of the Kobayakawa family wrote.

355
00:19:27,492 --> 00:19:29,147
Please read it for us.

356
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:33,151
I have studied under the teacher, Shouin Yoshida.

357
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:36,092
And I have learned about a great treasure that cannot change in time,

358
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,892
whatever the world may be.

359
00:19:38,892 --> 00:19:40,392
He says that,

360
00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:41,992
"It is the goals we have in life"

361
00:19:41,992 --> 00:19:44,492
"that are the beginning of all things."

362
00:19:44,492 --> 00:19:49,167
"It is having a purpose in one's life that gives rise to everything."

363
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:50,892
According to his teachings,

364
00:19:50,892 --> 00:19:54,592
we students with the ambition to make the country better.

365
00:19:54,592 --> 00:19:56,492
Shall come to see how we can make a difference

366
00:19:56,492 --> 00:19:57,992
in the real world.

367
00:19:57,992 --> 00:20:00,192
From here on, no matter how bitter the winds

368
00:20:00,192 --> 00:20:02,192
that may sweep over our world,

369
00:20:02,192 --> 00:20:05,183
our greatest asset will be our ambition.

370
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:06,892
That we can change the people,

371
00:20:06,892 --> 00:20:09,892
and give them the power to change the country.

372
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:12,192
I must rely on my ability with my writing brush

373
00:20:12,192 --> 00:20:15,692
in order to communicate this to the generations to come.

374
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:17,492
The power to change the country?

375
00:20:17,492 --> 00:20:19,192
That's it!

376
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:22,192
It wasn't about buying a country,

377
00:20:22,192 --> 00:20:25,203
it was to change it!

378
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:31,192
Those who are unable to solve my riddle

379
00:20:31,192 --> 00:20:35,213
does not have the right to inherit the words of my ancestor.

380
00:20:37,492 --> 00:20:39,592
Shut up!

381
00:20:39,592 --> 00:20:42,492
Hisamichi Takahashi!

382
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:45,792
What worth is your ambition?

383
00:20:45,792 --> 00:20:48,292
I am asking you, what is the price

384
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:53,231
to buy your ambition, your goal?

385
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:57,892
Is there any meaning to buy ambition with money?

386
00:20:57,892 --> 00:21:00,492
If it could be bought with money,

387
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:03,241
it will disappear with the money used.

388
00:21:03,492 --> 00:21:05,243
Isn't that right?

389
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:33,331
"One Week Later" -This is the Shoka Village School?

390
00:22:33,331 --> 00:22:35,792
The people behind the Meiji Restoration

391
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:39,092
studied many different things here.

392
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:41,592
He turned himself in?

393
00:22:41,592 --> 00:22:44,692
Yeah. Hisamichi Takahashi

394
00:22:44,692 --> 00:22:47,345
did kidnap you and the others.

395
00:22:47,345 --> 00:22:51,792
However Ms. Kimiko is denying the kidnapping.

396
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:53,351
How naive of her.

397
00:22:53,592 --> 00:22:56,392
At any rate, what a waste.

398
00:22:56,392 --> 00:22:59,357
The stamp, right?

399
00:22:59,357 --> 00:23:02,992
As for that old stamp that was on the letter,

400
00:23:02,992 --> 00:23:05,692
that stamp had a printing error.

401
00:23:05,692 --> 00:23:08,092
The characters on it were printed upside down.

402
00:23:08,092 --> 00:23:09,367
It seems it's something

403
00:23:09,592 --> 00:23:13,892
worth tens of millions of yen among stamp collectors.

404
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:17,992
Kimiko, if you were to send a letter to the future,

405
00:23:17,992 --> 00:23:21,379
how much postage would you need?

406
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:24,192
That stamp was his answer to that riddle.

407
00:23:24,192 --> 00:23:26,792
And for his descendant who finds that letter,

408
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:29,387
it would give them funds to accomplish

409
00:23:29,387 --> 00:23:31,992
whatever great things they desire to do.

410
00:23:34,492 --> 00:23:37,395
I will glue this back together.

411
00:23:37,592 --> 00:23:41,792
With my will, I shall.

412
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:50,092
Man, what is the worth is your will?

413
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,411
Next Conan's Hint:

414
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,413
"Tasting"

415
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,415
The luxurious fragrance...

416
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,420
as it spread in the mouth is astounding.

417
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,900
This fruit juice tastes good.
