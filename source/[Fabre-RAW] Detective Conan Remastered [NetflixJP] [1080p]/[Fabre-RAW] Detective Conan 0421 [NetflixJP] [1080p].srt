1
00:00:02,522 --> 00:00:04,222
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:04,222 --> 00:00:06,022
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:06,022 --> 00:00:07,422
Let's meet once in 10 years.

4
00:00:07,422 --> 00:00:09,322
The first promise, a smeared postcard.

5
00:00:09,322 --> 00:00:10,922
This is Dr. Agasa's love story.

6
00:00:10,922 --> 00:00:12,522
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,522 --> 00:00:14,122
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,122 --> 00:00:16,322
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:27,213
"Ginkgo-Colored First Love (Part 1)"

10
00:02:29,613 --> 00:02:31,413
Hey, Dr. Agasa.

11
00:02:31,413 --> 00:02:34,813
What kind of letter is it?

12
00:02:34,813 --> 00:02:38,213
A letter in a postcard size envelope.

13
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:45,813
I guess we've got no choice

14
00:02:45,813 --> 00:02:47,113
but look for it all together.

15
00:02:47,113 --> 00:02:49,913
What was the letter about, Dr. Agasa?

16
00:02:49,913 --> 00:02:52,813
It was an invitation to the wedding

17
00:02:52,813 --> 00:02:55,413
of an acquaintance doctor's son's wedding.

18
00:02:55,413 --> 00:02:58,413
If I remember correctly the R.S.V.P. postcard was enclosed

19
00:02:58,413 --> 00:03:00,813
and the deadline for answering it was today.

20
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:04,213
You should have kept it carefully.

21
00:03:04,213 --> 00:03:06,113
Absolutely.

22
00:03:06,113 --> 00:03:08,213
Will you stop barking up the wrong tree?

23
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:11,213
You're all to blame for the letter getting lost too,

24
00:03:11,213 --> 00:03:13,313
since you came over to play games last night

25
00:03:13,313 --> 00:03:15,813
and messed the place up.

26
00:03:18,013 --> 00:03:19,113
That's true.

27
00:03:20,213 --> 00:03:23,013
By the way, you look sleepy as usual.

28
00:03:24,713 --> 00:03:25,813
Bug you?

29
00:03:25,813 --> 00:03:29,213
I guess you can't help being sleepy

30
00:03:29,213 --> 00:03:31,813
since you get up early and go to school with Ayumi

31
00:03:31,813 --> 00:03:33,713
to look in on the rabbits at school.

32
00:03:35,213 --> 00:03:37,013
How come you know?

33
00:03:37,013 --> 00:03:38,913
Were you watching us?

34
00:03:38,913 --> 00:03:42,213
I saw ginkgo leaves on the hair of you both.

35
00:03:47,813 --> 00:03:51,213
That rabbit hut is by the gingko tree lined street

36
00:03:51,213 --> 00:03:52,613
behind the school yard, isn't it?

37
00:03:52,613 --> 00:03:53,813
That's about the only place,

38
00:03:53,813 --> 00:03:55,213
you can find gingko trees around here.

39
00:03:55,213 --> 00:03:58,113
Moreover, the girls were making a fuss

40
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,413
over the rabbit looking sick yesterday.

41
00:04:00,413 --> 00:04:02,413
Cool.

42
00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:07,313
Then, would you please hurry and look for the letter, Mr. Detective?

43
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,013
Let's see.

44
00:04:09,013 --> 00:04:11,913
Dr. Agasa has a habit of putting letters

45
00:04:11,913 --> 00:04:14,013
and postcards that he finishes reading on the TV set,

46
00:04:14,013 --> 00:04:16,013
so behind the set is a likely place for it to be.

47
00:04:16,013 --> 00:04:17,413
But you've probably already looked there.

48
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:20,913
There are a lot of things down here.

49
00:04:20,913 --> 00:04:22,713
See. This much.

50
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:24,413
No joke?

51
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:26,813
That's the first place you should've looked.

52
00:04:28,613 --> 00:04:31,613
Talk about a lot of things down here.

53
00:04:31,613 --> 00:04:32,713
Let's see.

54
00:04:32,713 --> 00:04:35,313
New Year's cards, midsummer greeting cards, and...

55
00:04:35,313 --> 00:04:38,313
Goodness. A driver's license renewal notice too.

56
00:04:38,313 --> 00:04:42,713
Oh My. They're all stuff that I thought I lost.

57
00:04:43,713 --> 00:04:46,013
Oh. What cute handwriting.

58
00:04:46,013 --> 00:04:47,313
"To Mr. Agasa" -This postcard must've been written

59
00:04:47,313 --> 00:04:48,313
by a child.

60
00:04:48,313 --> 00:04:49,313
"Mr. Hiroshi Agasa"

61
00:04:49,313 --> 00:04:51,213
Oh, this is the one.

62
00:04:51,213 --> 00:04:53,813
Yeah! Here it is, Dr. Agasa!

63
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:56,213
Dr. Agasa?

64
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:04,213
What? Have you found something good?

65
00:05:04,213 --> 00:05:05,713
What?

66
00:05:05,713 --> 00:05:07,413
Say, that's the postcard written by a child that we saw a while ago.

67
00:05:07,413 --> 00:05:10,313
-Well... -Could it be a love letter?

68
00:05:10,313 --> 00:05:14,913
No, it's a card I received from my friend long ago.

69
00:05:14,913 --> 00:05:18,013
It was 40 years ago.

70
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:19,813
40 years ago?

71
00:05:19,813 --> 00:05:22,213
Which means that this is something back

72
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:24,013
from when you were in the 6th grade?

73
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:25,013
Yeah.

74
00:05:25,013 --> 00:05:28,913
It was the first day of school after summer vacation.

75
00:05:30,713 --> 00:05:32,813
I took a different road from the usual

76
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:35,813
because I was late for school.

77
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:37,513
Then, I saw a girl,

78
00:05:37,513 --> 00:05:40,913
who was an under classman standing stalled and looking pale.

79
00:05:40,913 --> 00:05:43,413
She was a cute girl with big round eyes

80
00:05:43,413 --> 00:05:47,313
that could be seen from the cap that she wore quite deeply.

81
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:49,513
It seems that she was scared of the barking dog

82
00:05:49,513 --> 00:05:51,813
and was stalled because of it.

83
00:05:52,813 --> 00:05:54,813
Well, a person named Mr. Noi owned a big dog,

84
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,713
and it was also well-known in the neighborhood

85
00:05:57,713 --> 00:05:59,713
so I guess it couldn't be helped.

86
00:05:59,713 --> 00:06:03,113
She looked so scared, despite hiding behind me

87
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:06,713
when passing by the dog, that I asked her why.

88
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:08,213
She told me that she had been bitten by a dog

89
00:06:08,213 --> 00:06:10,013
that she had when she was little,

90
00:06:10,013 --> 00:06:13,313
and that she had become to hate animals since then.

91
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:18,913
I felt sorry for her plight,

92
00:06:18,913 --> 00:06:20,813
so I took her to the place of an acquaintance

93
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:24,013
named Mr. Chono who kept a hamster.

94
00:06:24,013 --> 00:06:26,513
She was scared at first,

95
00:06:26,513 --> 00:06:29,913
but she seemed to get used to as the days went by.

96
00:06:29,913 --> 00:06:34,013
After two months, she turned into an animal lover.

97
00:06:34,013 --> 00:06:38,613
She could even laugh when passing in front of Mr. Noi's dog.

98
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:43,313
So, you and that girl went to school together every day, right?

99
00:06:44,913 --> 00:06:46,013
Yeah, I guess so.

100
00:06:46,013 --> 00:06:49,313
Only during fall of that year, though...

101
00:06:49,313 --> 00:06:51,013
Only during fall?

102
00:06:51,013 --> 00:06:54,813
Right. On a rainy morning at the end of November,

103
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:57,513
I was waiting like always in front of the Mr. Noi residence

104
00:06:57,513 --> 00:07:00,513
for her to come but,

105
00:07:00,513 --> 00:07:03,713
no matter how long I waited she didn't show up.

106
00:07:03,713 --> 00:07:05,413
Worried that she may have caught cold or something

107
00:07:05,413 --> 00:07:07,513
I went to her house after school

108
00:07:07,513 --> 00:07:09,313
too check things out but,

109
00:07:09,313 --> 00:07:13,713
the lady next door told me she had moved that morning.

110
00:07:15,113 --> 00:07:16,713
She moved?

111
00:07:16,713 --> 00:07:18,413
Without telling you?

112
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:21,013
She could've at least said goodbye.

113
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:22,213
No.

114
00:07:22,213 --> 00:07:24,113
She probably...

115
00:07:24,113 --> 00:07:27,413
She probably couldn't even if she wanted to.

116
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:31,513
Goodbye, is a sad word

117
00:07:31,513 --> 00:07:33,713
that pricks the heart like a needle.

118
00:07:33,713 --> 00:07:35,613
It can't be.

119
00:07:35,613 --> 00:07:40,613
But, it's too sad leaving without saying a word.

120
00:07:40,613 --> 00:07:43,813
No, she did thank me.

121
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:48,313
I found that postcard in the mailbox of my house that day.

122
00:07:50,713 --> 00:07:54,413
But, there isn't any stamp on the postcard.

123
00:07:54,413 --> 00:07:58,213
She probably put it in the mailbox of your house herself,

124
00:07:58,213 --> 00:07:59,313
just before she moved.

125
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:01,713
And? What's written on it?

126
00:08:01,713 --> 00:08:02,813
Oh...

127
00:08:02,813 --> 00:08:04,913
Thank you for the three months.

128
00:08:04,913 --> 00:08:07,913
It was a lot of fun being with you.

129
00:08:07,913 --> 00:08:09,313
I don't like goodbye, so I want to say,

130
00:08:09,313 --> 00:08:10,513
let's meet again.

131
00:08:10,513 --> 00:08:12,113
10 years later, on this day,

132
00:08:12,113 --> 00:08:15,813
before the sun sets at that memorable place.

133
00:08:15,813 --> 00:08:18,413
If I can't see you then, 10 years after that will do.

134
00:08:18,413 --> 00:08:20,913
I'll wait for you even if I grow to be a grandmother.

135
00:08:20,913 --> 00:08:23,513
Come see me if you have the time.

136
00:08:23,513 --> 00:08:26,613
To Hiroshi Agasa who I like, like, like very much.

137
00:08:26,613 --> 00:08:30,413
November 24th, 4th grade, class A,

138
00:08:30,413 --> 00:08:32,213
Kinoshita...

139
00:08:32,213 --> 00:08:34,013
The words are smeared that I can't read it.

140
00:08:35,013 --> 00:08:37,113
It probably got wet in the rain

141
00:08:37,113 --> 00:08:39,313
when she was putting it in the mailbox.

142
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:42,413
And, did you get to see her? Ms. Kinoshita.

143
00:08:42,413 --> 00:08:46,713
No, I don't know where that memorable place is you see...

144
00:08:46,713 --> 00:08:48,213
Hey, hey...

145
00:08:48,213 --> 00:08:52,613
But... Isn't November 24th today?

146
00:08:52,613 --> 00:08:55,813
And it's exactly 40 years ago...

147
00:08:55,813 --> 00:08:58,213
Maybe that girl...

148
00:08:58,213 --> 00:09:00,713
She is waiting for you there today too!

149
00:09:00,713 --> 00:09:04,513
But, if Dr. Agasa can't remember the place.

150
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:08,113
So... I'm sorry...

151
00:09:08,113 --> 00:09:09,713
Really...

152
00:09:09,713 --> 00:09:14,213
You've always been dense when it came to things like this from before.

153
00:09:14,213 --> 00:09:19,213
Hey, maybe it's the place where that scary dog was?

154
00:09:19,213 --> 00:09:22,513
I see. The place where you first met each other.

155
00:09:22,513 --> 00:09:25,513
I thought so too, so I went there 10 years later

156
00:09:25,513 --> 00:09:27,413
and waited for her there for a long time,

157
00:09:27,413 --> 00:09:29,013
but no one came.

158
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:31,713
Then, what about the house of the person who had the hamster?

159
00:09:31,713 --> 00:09:34,213
I went to his house 20 years later,

160
00:09:34,213 --> 00:09:37,013
one day before and spent the night there.

161
00:09:37,013 --> 00:09:40,413
Too bad, she didn't show up though.

162
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,813
I'm sure she was waiting elsewhere.

163
00:09:43,813 --> 00:09:46,713
You never got a letter from her after that?

164
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:49,313
No. She had the address of my parent's home,

165
00:09:49,313 --> 00:09:52,513
but my parents moved to the country too so.

166
00:09:52,513 --> 00:09:55,813
Then, why don't you write her?

167
00:09:55,813 --> 00:09:57,713
I don't know her address or her name,

168
00:09:57,713 --> 00:09:59,613
so I can't even if I wanted to.

169
00:09:59,613 --> 00:10:01,413
What? You don't know her name?

170
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:05,513
I think you can easily get it at the grade school you went to?

171
00:10:05,513 --> 00:10:07,513
Of course, I thought of asking her.

172
00:10:07,513 --> 00:10:09,613
But I figured I could see her 10 years later anyway,

173
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:11,613
so I didn't.

174
00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:12,613
That's right!

175
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:15,213
You went to Teitan Elementary school too, didn't you, Dr. Agasa?

176
00:10:15,213 --> 00:10:17,213
Then, maybe we can give them a call?

177
00:10:17,213 --> 00:10:20,413
Oh, but there's no school today,

178
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:22,913
so only the custodian is there.

179
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,613
Besides, if by chance you're able to find out

180
00:10:24,613 --> 00:10:26,613
what her name and address are,

181
00:10:26,613 --> 00:10:29,813
and if you fortunately are able to get in touch with her

182
00:10:29,813 --> 00:10:32,813
and see her, maybe all you'll be doing is hurting her feelings?

183
00:10:32,813 --> 00:10:37,313
Dr. Agasa didn't know what place she thought was important,

184
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:40,913
and the fact that he made her wait meaninglessly

185
00:10:40,913 --> 00:10:42,613
for 40 years is going to be revealed.

186
00:10:44,413 --> 00:10:46,413
I don't think you need to take it that far.

187
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:52,213
That is, only if she's waiting there today.

188
00:10:52,213 --> 00:10:55,913
Then, Dr. Agasa's going to have to remember the place

189
00:10:55,913 --> 00:10:57,513
and go see her after all.

190
00:10:57,513 --> 00:11:03,213
But, it's already been 40 years, so remembering is...

191
00:11:03,213 --> 00:11:06,213
But we've got clues.

192
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:07,913
Clues?

193
00:11:07,913 --> 00:11:08,913
"To Mr. Agasa" -See,

194
00:11:08,913 --> 00:11:10,113
"The Hint Is: Animal" -below the name of the addressee,

195
00:11:10,113 --> 00:11:12,313
you can see a row of numbers, right?

196
00:11:12,313 --> 00:11:16,413
"The Hint Is: Animal" -This could be a code that indicates the place.

197
00:11:17,313 --> 00:11:20,213
-Really. -But, what does it mean?

198
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:25,413
4163, 33, 6, 0.

199
00:11:25,413 --> 00:11:28,413
It says here that the hint is an animal.

200
00:11:28,413 --> 00:11:30,913
Hey, Dr. Agasa, what does this mean?

201
00:11:30,913 --> 00:11:32,213
Well...

202
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:35,113
If you knew, you would've met her already, right?

203
00:11:35,113 --> 00:11:36,613
I'm ashamed.

204
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,513
But, maybe you can solve it, Conan.

205
00:11:38,513 --> 00:11:40,213
Nope, I don't have the slightest idea.

206
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:41,713
I see.

207
00:11:41,713 --> 00:11:46,113
Hey, if she's only waiting till sundown,

208
00:11:46,113 --> 00:11:49,413
you only have about four hours left.

209
00:11:49,413 --> 00:11:52,113
Then, I guess we have no choice but to go to Sleeping Kogoro

210
00:11:52,113 --> 00:11:55,013
and have him decipher the code.

211
00:11:55,013 --> 00:12:00,713
Pops is at the joint live concert of Yoko Okino and Misa Nakayama,

212
00:12:00,713 --> 00:12:01,813
so he's not in now.

213
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:02,813
What?

214
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:04,413
Misa?

215
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:05,813
Did you remember something?

216
00:12:05,813 --> 00:12:08,613
The first name of the person called Kinoshita.

217
00:12:08,613 --> 00:12:11,913
I sort of think her name was something like that.

218
00:12:11,913 --> 00:12:14,513
Hey, if Sleeping Kogoro's not around,

219
00:12:14,513 --> 00:12:18,013
maybe we should ask Sonoko?

220
00:12:18,013 --> 00:12:22,913
Right. She was bragging that she solved a case the other day too.

221
00:12:22,913 --> 00:12:25,513
Sonoko's not around either.

222
00:12:25,513 --> 00:12:28,513
She's out with Ran since this morning standing in line

223
00:12:28,513 --> 00:12:30,913
to buy a brand-name handbag that's going on sale just today.

224
00:12:31,913 --> 00:12:33,913
Besides, if I can't solve it,

225
00:12:33,913 --> 00:12:36,613
those two wouldn't be able to solve it either.

226
00:12:36,613 --> 00:12:38,313
Oh, it's the one that's on sale

227
00:12:38,313 --> 00:12:42,713
in commemoration of Fusae Campbell's visit to Japan.

228
00:12:42,713 --> 00:12:44,213
Fusae?

229
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:47,513
It could've been that sort of name too.

230
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:49,813
No, wait... Misae...

231
00:12:49,813 --> 00:12:52,213
No, or was it Fusako?

232
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:58,013
I wonder what's so good about that leaf-patterned handbag.

233
00:12:58,013 --> 00:12:59,613
It' s expensive, isn't it?

234
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:02,013
The "Fusae Brand" handbag are not leaf-patterned, those are ginkgos.

235
00:13:02,013 --> 00:13:04,113
They're the trademark of the "Fusae brand".

236
00:13:04,113 --> 00:13:07,313
And, not all the items are that expensive.

237
00:13:07,313 --> 00:13:11,913
That brand has a number of reasonably priced items too.

238
00:13:13,113 --> 00:13:14,913
A number?

239
00:13:14,913 --> 00:13:16,713
Will you show it to me, Conan?

240
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,513
What's up, Ayumi?

241
00:13:18,513 --> 00:13:20,813
Hey, maybe this code

242
00:13:20,813 --> 00:13:24,413
has something to do with the number of animals at our school.

243
00:13:25,313 --> 00:13:31,013
Well, there are six rabbits, chickens, society finches and pigeons.

244
00:13:31,013 --> 00:13:33,713
All the birds added together make a total of 33 birds, right?

245
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,013
Then, what about the zero?

246
00:13:36,013 --> 00:13:37,713
That's the number of turtles

247
00:13:37,713 --> 00:13:39,413
that died during summer vacation.

248
00:13:40,413 --> 00:13:42,613
No way.

249
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,113
When I was in elementary school,

250
00:13:44,113 --> 00:13:46,413
the turtle was still alive and kicking,

251
00:13:46,413 --> 00:13:51,413
and the only animal other than that were the chickens.

252
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:55,813
Besides, the first numbers 4163 are unexplained, right?

253
00:13:55,813 --> 00:13:57,713
Oh, that's right.

254
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:02,113
But, turtles live long, don't they to be alive for 40 years?

255
00:14:02,113 --> 00:14:04,913
No, that's actually the 3rd turtle,

256
00:14:04,913 --> 00:14:07,313
and it's rumored that each time a turtle dies,

257
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,113
a new one is brought over from the zoo.

258
00:14:09,113 --> 00:14:11,513
That's true.

259
00:14:11,513 --> 00:14:13,613
A graduate of Teitan Elementary school,

260
00:14:13,613 --> 00:14:16,213
and the first head of the Tohto Zoo,

261
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:18,613
Mr. Yoichirou Kobata,

262
00:14:18,613 --> 00:14:20,813
in hopes of wanting the children to live

263
00:14:20,813 --> 00:14:24,513
a long life gave the turtle to the school as a gift.

264
00:14:24,513 --> 00:14:26,913
They say that turtles live a million years too.

265
00:14:28,313 --> 00:14:31,713
Dr. Agasa, what did you just say?

266
00:14:31,713 --> 00:14:33,313
Turtles live a million years?

267
00:14:33,313 --> 00:14:37,613
No. The name of the first head of Tohto Zoo.

268
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:39,713
He said, Kobata...

269
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,313
Mr. Yoichirou?

270
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:42,913
"Four" -Yo... (In Japanese 4)

271
00:14:42,913 --> 00:14:43,913
"One, Six" -Ichirou... (1 and 6)

272
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:45,613
"Three" -San... (means Mr.)

273
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:47,213
-That's it! -That's it!

274
00:14:47,213 --> 00:14:48,513
Hey, hey...

275
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:49,613
Oh, boy.

276
00:14:59,057 --> 00:15:00,157
"Tohto Zoo"

277
00:15:12,057 --> 00:15:14,657
Hey, look good and hard.

278
00:15:14,657 --> 00:15:18,657
Yes. She's sure to be here somewhere.

279
00:15:18,657 --> 00:15:20,857
Dr. Agasa's first love.

280
00:15:20,857 --> 00:15:23,057
We'll get her for sure.

281
00:15:23,057 --> 00:15:24,457
-Yeah! -Yeah!

282
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:28,657
Hey. I never said she was my love.

283
00:15:28,657 --> 00:15:30,057
It's so obvious.

284
00:15:38,057 --> 00:15:41,557
Well, even if I were to believe what they said

285
00:15:41,557 --> 00:15:44,257
about 4163 being Mr. Yoichirou.

286
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:47,657
The connection with 33, 6, and 0 that comes after that is not solved...

287
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:51,057
Pandas are cute after all.

288
00:15:51,057 --> 00:15:52,257
Yeah.

289
00:15:52,257 --> 00:15:54,557
I'd like to have one.

290
00:15:54,557 --> 00:15:56,057
Hey, you guys...

291
00:15:56,057 --> 00:15:59,557
Hey, I wonder what that number is?

292
00:15:59,557 --> 00:16:03,257
See, the number that is written on the name plate of the animals.

293
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:10,257
The numbers are probably designated to categorize the animals.

294
00:16:10,257 --> 00:16:12,657
But the numbers are picked too much at random.

295
00:16:13,657 --> 00:16:16,357
The numbers are designated in the order

296
00:16:16,357 --> 00:16:18,657
in which the animals came into the zoo.

297
00:16:18,657 --> 00:16:22,557
Therefore, the panda was the 58th animal that was put in here.

298
00:16:22,557 --> 00:16:25,957
Then, which animal is the 33rd?

299
00:16:25,957 --> 00:16:27,957
If I remember correctly, I think it was a donkey?

300
00:16:27,957 --> 00:16:29,057
Donkey?

301
00:16:29,057 --> 00:16:30,257
I get it.

302
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:31,957
"Mr. Yoichirou" -The 33rd animal that...

303
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:34,157
"33rd animal" -Yoichirou put in the zoo...

304
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:35,357
"Donkey" -Was a donkey!

305
00:16:37,557 --> 00:16:39,057
That's it!

306
00:16:40,157 --> 00:16:43,157
Hey! The zero hasn't been figured out yet.

307
00:16:43,157 --> 00:16:44,357
Hurry up, hurry up!

308
00:16:44,357 --> 00:16:45,957
-Yes! -Yes!

309
00:16:45,957 --> 00:16:48,157
They've been switched on.

310
00:16:51,757 --> 00:16:55,357
Number 33, number 33, number 33.

311
00:16:55,357 --> 00:16:57,857
Donkey, donkey, donkey.

312
00:16:57,857 --> 00:17:00,757
Woman, woman, woman.

313
00:17:00,757 --> 00:17:02,957
"33, Donkey"

314
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,057
Number 33!

315
00:17:07,057 --> 00:17:08,157
Donkey!

316
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:09,157
Woman!

317
00:17:10,157 --> 00:17:11,957
-Found her! -Found her!

318
00:17:11,957 --> 00:17:13,357
Hey, you guys...

319
00:17:13,357 --> 00:17:16,057
There she is. There she is.

320
00:17:16,057 --> 00:17:17,057
No joke?

321
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:24,157
She's wearing a hat so it's probably her, right?

322
00:17:24,157 --> 00:17:26,157
Let's try asking her then.

323
00:17:26,157 --> 00:17:27,557
Hey.

324
00:17:29,057 --> 00:17:30,657
-Excuse me. -Excuse me.

325
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:39,657
Aren't you?

326
00:17:41,557 --> 00:17:43,657
Oh, Mr. Hiroshi Agasa?

327
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:46,957
It's been a long time.

328
00:17:46,957 --> 00:17:50,357
Yes, 40 years, is it?

329
00:17:50,357 --> 00:17:53,257
You sure lost a lot of hair.

330
00:17:53,257 --> 00:17:54,957
No.

331
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:57,757
Then, don't tell me that

332
00:17:57,757 --> 00:17:59,657
this grandmother is...

333
00:17:59,657 --> 00:18:01,657
the one with the big round eyes...

334
00:18:01,657 --> 00:18:03,757
Of 40 years ago...

335
00:18:03,757 --> 00:18:06,557
Your first love?

336
00:18:06,557 --> 00:18:11,557
I guess this is a typical case of time beautifying all things.

337
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,857
But don't you think she looks a bit too old?

338
00:18:14,857 --> 00:18:18,057
When Dr. Agasa was in the 6th grade,

339
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:20,457
she was in the 4th grade, right?

340
00:18:20,457 --> 00:18:24,157
If so, she should be around 49 or 50 years old.

341
00:18:25,357 --> 00:18:28,157
Maybe she went through a lot of hard times.

342
00:18:28,157 --> 00:18:29,257
I guess so.

343
00:18:29,257 --> 00:18:31,157
Well then, see you then.

344
00:18:31,157 --> 00:18:33,657
Yeah. Take care.

345
00:18:34,757 --> 00:18:36,757
Hey... Are you done already?

346
00:18:36,757 --> 00:18:38,657
She's your first love, isn't she?

347
00:18:38,657 --> 00:18:41,657
No... She's Mrs. Noi.

348
00:18:41,657 --> 00:18:42,657
I told you about her, didn't I?

349
00:18:42,657 --> 00:18:44,357
She's the owner of the big dog

350
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:47,457
that used to bark a lot on our way back from school.

351
00:18:47,457 --> 00:18:50,257
The grand-dog of that dog seems to have died last month,

352
00:18:50,257 --> 00:18:53,957
and she got lonely so she came to the zoo.

353
00:18:53,957 --> 00:18:55,057
What?

354
00:18:55,057 --> 00:18:56,757
Wrong person.

355
00:18:56,757 --> 00:19:00,057
I thought she was a bit too old.

356
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:02,357
But, how strange.

357
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:06,857
If the place you are to meet her is the code 4163,

358
00:19:06,857 --> 00:19:09,057
it's about the head of the zoo,

359
00:19:09,057 --> 00:19:11,557
Mr. Yoichirou Kobata, and,

360
00:19:11,557 --> 00:19:15,257
if three, three designates the 33rd animal that came here,

361
00:19:15,257 --> 00:19:17,157
and if six is a donkey,

362
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:20,257
she supposed to be waiting here.

363
00:19:20,257 --> 00:19:21,657
I told you, right?

364
00:19:21,657 --> 00:19:24,257
That the last zero hasn't been solved yet.

365
00:19:24,257 --> 00:19:29,457
And? Can't you remember anything else that would could be a hint?

366
00:19:29,457 --> 00:19:33,357
Nothing other than that her eyes were big

367
00:19:33,357 --> 00:19:36,757
and that her last name was Kinoshita.

368
00:19:36,757 --> 00:19:40,557
And also that she liked to take care of the chickens at school.

369
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:44,057
She had freckles on her cheeks,

370
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,357
and for some reason always wore her cap deeply over her head.

371
00:19:46,357 --> 00:19:48,257
That's about it.

372
00:19:49,257 --> 00:19:50,657
Always?

373
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:53,657
Yeah. On the way to school and back.

374
00:19:53,657 --> 00:19:57,057
Of course I think she took it off during class, though.

375
00:19:57,057 --> 00:19:59,057
I wonder if there was a reason for her wearing the cap?

376
00:19:59,057 --> 00:20:00,757
She wasn't bald.

377
00:20:00,757 --> 00:20:03,857
She was probably a very shy girl.

378
00:20:03,857 --> 00:20:06,457
Then we have no choice but to figure out

379
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:08,457
the code and find the place after all.

380
00:20:09,357 --> 00:20:13,657
Let's say that 4163 is this zoo.

381
00:20:13,657 --> 00:20:17,557
The problem is the number three, three, six and zero.

382
00:20:17,557 --> 00:20:19,357
"Mimimure" -Mimimure...

383
00:20:19,357 --> 00:20:20,757
"Mimiroku" -Mimiroku...

384
00:20:21,757 --> 00:20:24,957
Hey, maybe it's about an owl?

385
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:28,857
If it's an owl, the numbers would be three, three, two, nine.

386
00:20:28,857 --> 00:20:30,557
"Sasarokuwa" -Sasarokuwa...

387
00:20:30,557 --> 00:20:32,357
"Sasarokure" -Sasarokure...

388
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:33,657
"Sasamu" -Sasamu...

389
00:20:34,657 --> 00:20:36,257
Flying squirrel (Musasabi)!

390
00:20:36,257 --> 00:20:39,257
How silly. Then it would be the same as before.

391
00:20:39,257 --> 00:20:41,457
The meaning of zero is not solved, is it?

392
00:20:41,457 --> 00:20:44,857
No. Not really.

393
00:20:44,857 --> 00:20:46,657
It says on the postcard,

394
00:20:46,657 --> 00:20:51,157
let's meet before the sun sets, right?

395
00:20:51,157 --> 00:20:53,357
Flying squirrels are nocturnal animals

396
00:20:53,357 --> 00:20:54,957
that move about only at night.

397
00:20:54,957 --> 00:20:57,057
In other words, before the sun sets it is asleep in its nest,

398
00:20:57,057 --> 00:20:58,957
and the number of flying squirrels

399
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:01,957
that meet the eyes of the zoo comers is...

400
00:21:03,057 --> 00:21:04,057
Zero!

401
00:21:04,057 --> 00:21:06,157
Is zero flying squirrels.

402
00:21:06,157 --> 00:21:11,157
But, are there animals at the zoo that you only get to see at night?

403
00:21:11,157 --> 00:21:12,257
Stupid.

404
00:21:12,257 --> 00:21:16,457
Cages are set up indoors in most zoos

405
00:21:16,457 --> 00:21:18,957
so that nocturnal animals can also be viewed.

406
00:21:19,957 --> 00:21:21,457
Okay, let's go then.

407
00:21:21,457 --> 00:21:22,657
-Yeah! -Yeah!

408
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:24,857
"Nocturnal Animals Building"

409
00:21:24,857 --> 00:21:26,357
Really...

410
00:21:26,357 --> 00:21:28,257
It's full of nocturnal animals.

411
00:21:29,257 --> 00:21:32,657
But, it's full of bats and snakes that it's kind of eerie.

412
00:21:32,657 --> 00:21:33,657
Yes.

413
00:21:33,657 --> 00:21:36,857
Let's see. Flying squirrels, flying squirrels.

414
00:21:42,057 --> 00:21:43,557
There they are!

415
00:21:43,557 --> 00:21:44,957
The flying squirrels!

416
00:21:46,357 --> 00:21:48,757
Dr. Agasa, there's someone there.

417
00:21:50,557 --> 00:21:53,557
She seems to be waiting for someone.

418
00:21:53,557 --> 00:21:57,757
She's not wearing a hat, but I'm sure it's her.

419
00:21:57,757 --> 00:22:00,657
See. You're meeting her after 40 years,

420
00:22:00,657 --> 00:22:02,157
so go do your thing.

421
00:22:02,157 --> 00:22:03,157
Yeah.

422
00:24:32,225 --> 00:24:34,425
Next Conan's Hint:

423
00:24:34,425 --> 00:24:36,625
"Blonde"

424
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:37,825
Ai's first love is?

425
00:24:37,825 --> 00:24:38,825
Dr. Agasa.

426
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:39,825
Just joking.
