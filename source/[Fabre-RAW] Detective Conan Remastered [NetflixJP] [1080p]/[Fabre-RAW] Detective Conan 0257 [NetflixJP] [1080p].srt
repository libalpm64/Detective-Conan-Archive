1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,590
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,590
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,190
Even if you put a lot of money in the offertory box,

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,990
your prayer won't be answered if it's for no good.

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,590
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,590
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,590
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,350
In the middle of the night

9
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,250
at 2:15 am,

10
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,250
when everyone was fast asleep,

11
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,550
the earth shook violently.

12
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,850
"Earthquake in the Dead of Night, West of Tokyo"

13
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,300
Last night's earthquake was a big one.

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,500
What in the world...

15
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,800
Hey, are you all right?

16
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,300
The bell?

17
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,400
Last night's earthquake must have caused the bell to fall

18
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,300
and hit him on the head.

19
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,100
Someone was trying to break into the offertory box.

20
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,700
It must have been this fellow.

21
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,700
"Strange Punishment"

22
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,600
Someone tried to steal the offerings?

23
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,700
Yes, this morning at Teitan Shrine.

24
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,400
I bet he's really going to be punished.

25
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,700
Listen, why don't we go and catch the guy?

26
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,300
No, wait!

27
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,400
The thief has already been caught.

28
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,200
What do you mean?

29
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,800
That sucks.

30
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,300
Then, just like that he was arrested by the police.

31
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,400
So, you should always listen to the whole story, Genta.

32
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,300
I guess coincidences like that do happen.

33
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,400
The earthquake struck

34
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,000
while he was trying to steal the money.

35
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,800
Then, the "garan garan" fell on his head...

36
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,300
and he got knocked out.

37
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,500
What's a "garan garan"?

38
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,100
Good grief, Conan,

39
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,700
that's what they call the shrine bell. Didn't you know that?

40
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,300
Don't tell me you didn't even know that.

41
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,900
Oh, I see.

42
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,700
Heaven certainly has punished him.

43
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,800
That's why you shouldn't do bad things.

44
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,500
He certainly was an unlucky thief, wasn't he?

45
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,000
Yes, what a loser.

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,900
Don't you think so too, Conan?

47
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,100
Conan?

48
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,400
Why do you think thief chose this small shrine?

49
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,800
Huh? What do you mean?

50
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Just look at this place.

51
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,500
But what am I going do?

52
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,400
There's no money for the repairs.

53
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,900
Even if he managed to get the offertory box open,

54
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,500
it doesn't look like there'd be much inside, does it?

55
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,000
I see what you mean.

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'd understand him trying to rob Beika Shrine

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,800
because a lot more people go to pray there.

58
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,200
Maybe he didn't know about Beika Shrine.

59
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,200
That's right, I bet he's from some place far away.

60
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,400
Let's forget about it.

61
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,200
There might be other cases to solve because of the earthquake.

62
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,000
You're right, here might be other people who need our help!

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,500
Then, we shouldn't let them down!

64
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,700
All right. Youth Detective Squad, let's get to work!

65
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,000
-Let's go! -Let's go!

66
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,000
What was that?

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,100
A scream?

68
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,100
Takeo, what's the matter?

69
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,600
Talk to me, Mr. Takeo!

70
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,200
Takeo!

71
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,000
Takeo, don't die!

72
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,100
Takeo!

73
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,700
Genta, call an ambulance!

74
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,100
Okay!

75
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,500
Takeo, are you okay?

76
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,700
Takeo!

77
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,000
I see.

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,400
So, you two are getting married next month.

79
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,000
Yes, he and I were supposed to go to our "nakodo's" home today,

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,600
but he didn't arrive when he said he would.

81
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,700
I tried calling him several time but there was no answer.

82
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,200
So you came here because you were worried.

83
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,100
Yes. When I got here, he was on the floor.

84
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,900
And I was so scared.

85
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,300
How is your head?

86
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,800
Luckily I suffered just a minor concussion

87
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,100
and the X-rays shows no brain damage.

88
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,300
I see.

89
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,200
Then, I'd like to get all the details Mr. Takenaka.

90
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,600
Please tell me about the attack.

91
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Of course. I had a meeting to attend last night.

92
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,100
So I got back late, it was about 2:30 am,

93
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,700
after the earthquake.

94
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,200
Goodness.

95
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,100
What a mess.

96
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,100
That earthquake sure shook things up.

97
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,000
This is terrible.

98
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,600
Who are you?

99
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,500
Stop!

100
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,800
You're not getting away!

101
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,000
This can't be happening. Is he dead?

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I don't believe this!

103
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,300
Come back here...

104
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,700
You're saying that

105
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,300
he ran away because he thought he killed you?

106
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,400
Probably.

107
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,600
But I was only knocked unconscious.

108
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,300
What a panicky fellow.

109
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,100
That's the second loser today.

110
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,700
You're so right.

111
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,700
And was there anything stolen?

112
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,300
The 200,000 yen I had in the chest was taken.

113
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,000
All he took was the cash?

114
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yes.

115
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,400
This is going to be difficult.

116
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,500
Cash is hard to trace.

117
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,600
Excuse me, does that mean he won't be caught?

118
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,500
Don't worry, you can rest at ease.

119
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,000
If we find his fingerprints, he's as good as caught.

120
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,600
He was wearing gloves...

121
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,500
I guess I'll start by questioning the neighbors first.

122
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,500
Hello, Officer Takagi.

123
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Officer Otani, what're you doing here?

124
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
We're going over the crime scene.

125
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
At Teitan Shrine over there.

126
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,000
Oh, yes. I heard about that offertory thief.

127
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,800
"Rokusuke Urasawa (35)"

128
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,800
That's the stupid thief.

129
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,000
He does look stupid.

130
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,900
You shouldn't say such things, it's not nice.

131
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:47,100
His name's Urasawa, he lives on 4th chome just down the street.

132
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,000
4th chome?

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,100
He's a real coward but he just won't stop stealing.

134
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,700
He's been arrested twice before for breaking and entering.

135
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,800
I guess we've both got unpleasant work to do.

136
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,100
I'm working on a burglary.

137
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,800
Huh?

138
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,600
Is something wrong?

139
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Oh, no. It's nothing.

140
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
But seeings as they've got Officer Takagi

141
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,500
from the head office on the case,

142
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,300
I'm sure you'll get it wrapped up in no time.

143
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,800
Well, I've got to be going.

144
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,600
I'll see you later.

145
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,100
I hope he's right.

146
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,400
Well, I'd better go look for witnesses.

147
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,000
I'd really like to help Officer Takagi solve the case.

148
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,600
Right, especially since I heard he messed up last time

149
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,500
and was punished.

150
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,300
Don't worry.

151
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,100
This case is simple since there's no trick to it.

152
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,200
Isn't that right, Conan?

153
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,100
Conan?

154
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,900
What are you doing, Conan?

155
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,800
I knew it, something's fishy.

156
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,300
What's fishy?

157
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,900
About that offertory thief Urasawa.

158
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,700
Take a good look at this map.

159
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,500
4th chome is right next to Beika Shrine.

160
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,600
He lives so close and yet he chose to rob Teitan Shrine

161
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,400
which is much farther away and are unpopular.

162
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
It's just not logical, is it?

163
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,100
Who cares about that?

164
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,700
He got punished by heaven for trying to steal from that old shrine,

165
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,000
so what's the big deal?

166
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,600
Punished by heaven?

167
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,500
The "garan garan".

168
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,000
They usually don't fall even in an earthquake, you know.

169
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,500
No way...

170
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,600
No. If you think about it that way,

171
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,400
then that'll be reason enough to choose that place.

172
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,600
And if that is the case...

173
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,000
Hey, Conan!

174
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,600
It should be here...

175
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,600
If my theory is right,

176
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,200
it should be somewhere between there and Teitan Shrine.

177
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,900
What's the matter, Conan?

178
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,600
Why did you run off like that all of a sudden?

179
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,700
I found it!

180
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,900
Conan!

181
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,100
Is that what I think it is?

182
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,500
Yes. It might be so.

183
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm pretty sure

184
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,600
these belong to whoever attacked Mr. Takenaka.

185
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,100
Good work, Conan! Bravo!

186
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,700
We've got to let Officer Takagi know right away!

187
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,200
Yes, let's go.

188
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,600
But the money isn't here

189
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,900
and I doubt he has it on him.

190
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,000
I see.

191
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,700
It's in there!

192
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,500
Come on, mister. Hurry up, please.

193
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,200
I was going to put some money in

194
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,400
but I threw my favorite badge in by mistake.

195
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,000
All right, I understand.

196
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,300
I'll get it open soon.

197
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,900
What is this?

198
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,100
There it is!

199
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,200
Thank you very much.

200
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,400
Look at all that! Aren't you lucky, mister?

201
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,200
There's so much money in here.

202
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,400
This has never happened before.

203
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,100
How was it, Officer Takagi?

204
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes, there's no mistake about it.

205
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,800
That money was stolen from Mr. Takenaka's home.

206
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,300
His fingerprints were on them.

207
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,700
I knew it.

208
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,600
And we also found fingerprints

209
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,300
from somebody very unexpected on them.

210
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,300
Who are you talking about?

211
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,500
That offertory thief, Urasawa.

212
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,700
So that means he stole the money!

213
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,800
What a bad guy.

214
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,000
Wait just a minute, Genta.

215
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,100
Mr. Takenaka was attacked at about 2:30, isn't that right?

216
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,100
Yes.

217
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,900
Huh? But the earthquake was at 2:15 am, wasn't it?

218
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,600
That's right.

219
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,800
But at 2:30, that man was already unconscious at the shrine.

220
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,000
That's right!

221
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,300
The "garan garan" hit him on the head

222
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,000
and he should have been unconscious by then!

223
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,200
That's right.

224
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,300
It's impossible for an unconscious person

225
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,000
to be breaking into another place.

226
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,400
I don't understand it at all.

227
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,810
I just can't figure it out.

228
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,710
I thought it was just a simple burglary.

229
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,310
Officer Takagi...

230
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,510
Officer Takagi, excuse me.

231
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:57,310
Why don't you ask Inspector Megure to help you?

232
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,410
I think that would be best.

233
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,510
You've got to be kidding.

234
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:06,110
I can handle a case like this myself, just you watch!

235
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,710
But...

236
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,010
What do you think, Conan?

237
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,510
Huh? Conan?

238
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,810
-Conan? -Huh?

239
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,610
Yes, Takagi here.

240
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,010
Inspector Megure!

241
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,910
Well, truth is, Inspector Megure...

242
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,710
I don't want to hear any feeble excuses!

243
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:31,210
Officer Otani called me just now and gave me all the details.

244
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,010
Listen here, Officer Takagi.

245
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,610
This is where you show us what you can do.

246
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,410
Don't lose your confidence!

247
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,010
But, Inspector Megure...

248
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,310
You're a top notch detective.

249
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,210
I know that better than anyone else.

250
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:49,010
You just lack self-confidence, that's all.

251
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,810
Self-confidence?

252
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,710
That 's right, self-confidence.

253
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,810
You can solve this case. I know you can.

254
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,010
Take pride in yourself, Officer Takagi!

255
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,510
Yes, sir!

256
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,910
Good! I'll be waiting to hear good news from you.

257
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,210
Inspector Megure!

258
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,510
Thank you very much, sir!

259
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,410
Hey, what happened to Officer Takagi?

260
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,710
He's so happy all of a sudden.

261
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:15,010
He just got a call from Inspector Megure!

262
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,010
He told Officer Takagi to do his best.

263
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,910
I see.

264
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,810
Hey, Detective Takagi.

265
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,210
What is it?

266
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,910
Are you sure that guy Urasawa got knocked unconscious

267
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,410
at 2:15?

268
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,910
Huh?

269
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,510
What are you talking about?

270
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,010
That's when the earthquake occurred, right?

271
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:38,410
That's when the "garan garan" fell and hit him on the head.

272
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,510
But nobody saw it happen, right?

273
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:46,210
You're right. We've only got his word for it.

274
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,910
That's right.

275
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,910
Okay!

276
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,210
Let's find out what Urasawa was doing

277
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,610
at around the time of the attack.

278
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,710
We'll go about it on the assumption he was the one

279
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,410
who attacked Mr. Takenaka.

280
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,710
Okay!

281
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,510
Urasawa hated to work

282
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,110
and he was completely broke.

283
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:14,110
So he decided to steal some money.

284
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:19,010
He walked around looking for a place to break into.

285
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:27,110
Then, he decided to break into Mr. Takenaka's place.

286
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,310
I wonder why he chose this house though.

287
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:33,010
There's so many other houses around here.

288
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:37,310
Why? It was probably because nobody was home.

289
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,710
But if it was in the middle of the night,

290
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,610
so he wouldn't know if the house was empty

291
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,310
or if everyone was asleep, would he?

292
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,510
Well, that's...

293
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,510
He probably just took a chance.

294
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:49,910
That's right, who cares about that anyway?

295
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,810
No, it is important.

296
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,110
He must have had a reason.

297
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,210
He must have.

298
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,310
He's right.

299
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,910
There's got to be a good reason for it.

300
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,110
I don't get it.

301
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:08,910
How did Urasawa know no one was home in Mr. Takenaka's house?

302
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,410
Come on, Officer Takagi, think.

303
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:15,210
Did something happen in that house at that time?

304
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:18,510
No. No one was home, so nothing could have happened.

305
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:22,710
That's it!

306
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,010
The earthquake!

307
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:28,110
The earthquake occurred

308
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,510
just when Urasawa was passing by the house!

309
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:33,610
The strong earthquake occurred in the middle of the night.

310
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,510
It would've woken everybody up.

311
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,110
They would have been scared and turned on their lights.

312
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:42,510
But only Mr. Takenaka's home remained dark.

313
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:47,210
And realizing no one was home, he broke in.

314
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:52,110
But while he was looking for things to steal,

315
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,610
Mr. Takenaka came home.

316
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,110
Goodness.

317
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,010
What a mess.

318
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,210
That earthquake sure shook things up.

319
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:03,010
This is terrible.

320
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,310
Who's there?

321
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,310
Stop!

322
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,910
You're not getting away!

323
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,810
This can't be happening. Is he dead?

324
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,610
I don't believe this!

325
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,310
Urasawa thought he killed Mr. Takenaka,

326
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,010
he panicked and ran away.

327
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,510
He had to find a place to get rid

328
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,210
of the mask and gloves quickly.

329
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,610
He saw the garbage collection area,

330
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,610
so he throws them away there.

331
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,610
So that they wouldn't be found.

332
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,510
Criminals are very nervous at times like that, right?

333
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,210
I'm pretty sure they are.

334
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,510
He's actually a very timid man.

335
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,310
And although he just made the wrong assumption

336
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,910
by thinking that he committed murder.

337
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,610
He must have been in a panic.

338
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,510
He knew that the police would get high and low

339
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,810
for him now that the charge was murder,

340
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,110
and he didn't have an alibi.

341
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,910
Yes.

342
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,910
Alibi?

343
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,610
Alibi.

344
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,110
I'm pretty sure he would have thought

345
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,310
if only he could come up with an alibi!

346
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,610
That's right!

347
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,910
That's when Urasawa found it!

348
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,110
He saw the bell on the ground.

349
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:35,310
And he decided to make himself look like an offering thief.

350
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,910
In other words, he staged it.

351
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:42,110
What I'm trying to say is, his goal wasn't to steal the money,

352
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:46,010
It was actually to get caught trying to stealing it.

353
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,510
That way, he'd have an alibi for the time

354
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:50,510
where he thought Mr. Takenaka was killed.

355
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,710
I get it!

356
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,710
Officer Takagi, that was brilliant!

357
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,310
See, you can do it if you try!

358
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,510
But...

359
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,910
Why did he put the money he worked so hard to steal

360
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,410
inside the offertory box?

361
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,610
He didn't have a choice.

362
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,010
No one would believe he was an offertory thief

363
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:13,210
if he had 200,000 yen in his pocket.

364
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,510
Oh, I get it.

365
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,910
And besides, maybe...

366
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:25,310
I just killed somebody.

367
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:29,910
But I don't want to stay in prison for who knows how long.

368
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,010
Please. Oh please, God.

369
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,210
Please help me!

370
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:38,210
Maybe he prayed to God for help.

371
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,410
-Prayed to God? -Prayed to God?

372
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,110
It's possible!

373
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,910
She's right, he might have.

374
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,910
It just goes to prove how desperate he was.

375
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,110
And then he...

376
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:10,410
It went exactly like you said.

377
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,010
Officer Takagi!

378
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,910
What you're saying

379
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:14,910
is that you tried to hide one crime

380
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,310
by committing another crime, is that it?

381
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,710
Other people would think the same thing, wouldn't they?

382
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,010
I mean it's much better to be arrested

383
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,110
for something small like minor theft

384
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:29,010
than to be arrested for something big like murder.

385
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,410
Don't you think so?

386
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,510
You idiot!

387
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,710
Listen, Urasawa.

388
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,910
There's no such thing as a small crime or a big crime.

389
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,110
A crime is a crime

390
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,010
and the perpetrator shall always be punished!

391
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,210
Yes, you're right.

392
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,810
I'm sorry.

393
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,210
Hey, Takagi!

394
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,010
Oh, Inspector Megure!

395
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,510
I hear you did a good job solving the case.

396
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,710
Inspector Megure!

397
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,710
I've gained a lot of confidence from this experience,

398
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:30,910
now I know I can do my job well!

399
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,210
I'm glad to hear that...

400
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,010
I owe it all to you since you encouraged me!

401
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,010
Thank you very much!

402
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,210
Huh?

403
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,410
I'll see you later, Inspector Megure.

404
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:50,910
What was he talking about anyway?

405
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:56,010
Don't be shy, you thoughtful boss you.

406
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,910
-Don't be shy. -You thoughtful boss.

407
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,610
Well, at least, everything's worked out, right?

408
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,860
Next Conan's Hint:

409
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,380
"Strap"

410
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,020
In next week's episode,

411
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,980
an interesting international man makes an appearance!

412
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,120
Don't miss it!
