1
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,740
The cherry blossoms are in full bloom!

2
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,640
Flower viewing at a shrine is great too, isn't it?

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,140
Really, the weather's nice too.

4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,340
It's indeed a day for flower viewing.

5
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,040
My stomach is indeed ready for having lunch!

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,740
Geez Genta.

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,840
It's indeed a case of dumplings over flowers.

8
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,640
Then, Doc.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,540
We'll go draw some oracles

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,340
so will you save a place for us and spread out the sheet for us as well?

11
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,940
Okay.

12
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,840
Okay, let's go!

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,240
-Thank you! -Conan, let's go!

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,440
Yeah.

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,840
-What is it? -Huh?

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,640
Are you looking for something?

17
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,640
Oh, no. Not really.

18
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,040
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,940
are slashed by the light of deduction.

20
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,840
Information gets complicated under the cherry blossom tree.

21
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,640
A queer case and the FBI.

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,040
His name is Detective Conan!

25
00:02:55,469 --> 00:03:01,169
"In Reminiscence of Jodie and the Trap of Flower Viewing"

26
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:08,269
"Bad Luck"

27
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:11,369
Of all days, why today?

28
00:03:11,369 --> 00:03:13,369
It says I'm lucky.

29
00:03:13,369 --> 00:03:14,969
Mine says medium lucky!

30
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:17,969
Mine says least luck, so well...

31
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:20,569
Then let's go tie the oracles!

32
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:22,969
-Okay! -Hey.

33
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,069
Huh?

34
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:28,269
You drew yourselves good oracles so take them home!

35
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:31,569
You tie oracles in order to leave bad luck behind

36
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:34,169
and change your day to lucky.

37
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:37,769
It seems that recently a bad custom of tying all oracles

38
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:41,169
have become prevalent.

39
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:45,869
So, the only one who has to tie the oracle is Conan?

40
00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:48,869
She snuck a look at mine.

41
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:51,369
And, what did you draw?

42
00:03:51,369 --> 00:03:53,069
Oh, do you want to know?

43
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:54,869
Not really.

44
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:58,169
If you want to know that badly, why not?

45
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:01,769
Super lucky?

46
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:06,169
-Wow, Ai! -How lucky!

47
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:08,369
Will you change it with mine?

48
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:11,769
But I hear that super bad luck is rarely drawn,

49
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:14,569
so it actually means good luck.

50
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:16,769
Don't let it depress you, cool kid!

51
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,769
Jodie!

52
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:21,769
Jodie!

53
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:22,969
Hi.

54
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:25,469
Did you come to view flowers too?

55
00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:29,769
Oh, yes! I love cherry blossoms, you see!

56
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,069
I see?

57
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:34,469
You called Jodie over so that you could

58
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:36,769
talk in secret with her, didn't you?

59
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:38,269
Huh?

60
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:39,869
They say that parks and shrines

61
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:44,069
are often used by spies to exchange information.

62
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:47,469
Okay, everybody. Let's go elsewhere.

63
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:50,869
It seems they want to talk in secret, just the two of them.

64
00:04:50,869 --> 00:04:52,869
Okay.

65
00:04:52,869 --> 00:04:55,069
But, well, it's a place

66
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:58,469
where the security police are on the lookout too.

67
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:00,869
Take care.

68
00:05:00,869 --> 00:05:03,069
Okay.

69
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:09,369
And? What is it you want to talk to me about?

70
00:05:09,369 --> 00:05:11,769
Well, you said before that

71
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:15,069
you saw Mr. Akai who had a burn, didn't you?

72
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:16,869
Yes.

73
00:05:16,869 --> 00:05:20,069
During that bank robbery case.

74
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:29,669
Shu?

75
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:34,769
Hey, hold it!

76
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,269
Shu!

77
00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:40,569
Oh, sorry.

78
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:53,169
Shu...

79
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:55,669
Are you Shu? You're Shu, aren't you?

80
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:57,769
Tell me that you're Shu!

81
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:04,869
A burn scar.

82
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:09,069
That...

83
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,569
That wasn't Mr. Akai

84
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:13,969
but one of the members of the men in black,

85
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:16,369
Bourbon in disguise.

86
00:06:16,369 --> 00:06:18,069
Huh?

87
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:21,769
In order to check if Mr. Akai really died or not,

88
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:24,469
he was going around people who knew Mr. Akai

89
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:26,369
under that disguise.

90
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:28,969
Because if the FBI were faking his death,

91
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:30,769
they'd be able to tell by the way you react.

92
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:33,769
Well, back during the Bell Tree Express incident,

93
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,269
it seems that Vermouth herself, was disguised as Mr. Akai,

94
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:37,569
although she was the one who made

95
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:40,769
Bourbon disguise himself as Mr. Akai.

96
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:44,369
Bell Tree Express?

97
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:48,069
That train explosion was their doing too?

98
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:55,969
Yep. It seems so.

99
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:57,669
Hold it.

100
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:02,369
If that man with the burn was one of them...

101
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:06,769
then, Shu really is...

102
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:14,669
Then, the next time that man with the burn appears,

103
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:16,669
I'll nab him and peel off his disguise,

104
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,269
then expose his identity.

105
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:19,969
I know his identity!

106
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:21,169
Huh?

107
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:23,669
-As well as his whereabouts too! -What?

108
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:26,569
He goes by the name Toru Amuro,

109
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:28,869
and part-times at the coffee shop Poirot

110
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:30,969
below the Mouri Detective Agency.

111
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:33,669
-Why? -I wonder.

112
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:36,369
That's why I had you come here.

113
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:39,469
I want the FBI to check on it.

114
00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:43,069
On why he's still at Poirot despite having achieved

115
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:45,469
what he had to do.

116
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:46,769
Achieved what he had to do?

117
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:48,269
Yeah, that's...

118
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:50,169
Huh?

119
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,569
Aren't you the non-Japanese woman

120
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:57,469
who was held hostage with me during the bank robbery?

121
00:07:57,469 --> 00:07:58,769
Huh?

122
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:02,869
I was diagonally behind you back then,

123
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:05,769
and the one who taped your eyes and mouth with masking tape

124
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:07,769
was my wife.

125
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:09,769
Don't you remember me?

126
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:13,869
Yes, sort of.

127
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:17,369
Then, was that man with the burn scar

128
00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:20,369
who was next to you back then your boyfriend?

129
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:23,369
No. What's with you?

130
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,769
Oh, no.

131
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:26,869
If not, it's okay.

132
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:29,369
I saw him two or three days ago, you see.

133
00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:33,169
-Huh? -Where? Where'd you see him?

134
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:35,169
-Answer me! -Huh?

135
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:39,369
Pickpocket! There's a pickpocket!

136
00:08:40,869 --> 00:08:42,469
Ouch.

137
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:44,969
-Are you all right? -Are you okay? Madam?

138
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:46,469
Yes.

139
00:08:46,469 --> 00:08:49,369
Somebody put his hand into my bag,

140
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:51,069
so I was sort of flustered.

141
00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:52,869
It's true that there are a lot of pickpockets

142
00:08:52,869 --> 00:08:54,469
around in crowded places like these.

143
00:08:54,469 --> 00:08:55,869
Yes.

144
00:08:57,869 --> 00:09:01,069
Yes. It's very true.

145
00:09:01,069 --> 00:09:04,069
We've got to be careful.

146
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:06,669
Goodbye, then.

147
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:21,369
No, Genta!

148
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:23,269
You're not supposed to drink that water.

149
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:25,169
Huh? Oh?

150
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:26,469
You're supposed to just rinse your mouth

151
00:09:26,469 --> 00:09:28,869
and spit it out on the ground!

152
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:31,769
And? You can't remember yet?

153
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:33,769
Where you saw him?

154
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:37,569
No. I was knocked out in bed because of a cold yesterday

155
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:38,869
so my memory's...

156
00:09:40,869 --> 00:09:43,169
Your voice is really hoarse.

157
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:46,669
Then, maybe you should gargle your mouth with this water too?

158
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:50,669
No, thanks. I don't want to give my cold to anyone,

159
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:53,069
and I already cleansed my hands a while ago.

160
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:54,969
Could it be that you saw him

161
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,369
in front of a coffee vending machine somewhere?

162
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:00,869
Canned coffee? Does he like it?

163
00:10:00,869 --> 00:10:03,169
The man?

164
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:06,069
Yes. He used to drink a lot of it.

165
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:09,769
Yes, even back when those guys were about to

166
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:11,469
attack the hospital.

167
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:15,969
Shu.

168
00:10:15,969 --> 00:10:18,369
Doesn't he look familiar?

169
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:21,069
He's one of the men who was added to the investigation team.

170
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:22,669
Beats me.

171
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:25,169
As for those on the same team.

172
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:28,469
I don't forget the faces of enemies, though.

173
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:32,169
Well, it's only natural that he looks familiar.

174
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:34,869
He's an FBI agent after all.

175
00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:36,569
Yes.

176
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:41,269
But, when I look at him, I sense something dangerous.

177
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:55,069
Shu.

178
00:10:56,569 --> 00:11:01,269
He must've been tired to have dropped the canned coffee.

179
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:02,969
Rather, an attack?

180
00:11:02,969 --> 00:11:05,269
Oh no, no!

181
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:07,169
That man and the man with the burn scar

182
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:09,369
are two different people.

183
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,269
Never mind already!

184
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:13,669
If you recall something, contact me here, will you?

185
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:15,969
Yes, I will.

186
00:11:16,569 --> 00:11:18,569
Strange.

187
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:20,769
In the Bell Tree Express,

188
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:25,669
Bourbon said that he was convinced that Mr. Akai died, and yet...

189
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:29,569
Why does he still need to disguise himself as Mr. Akai?

190
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:33,469
What on earth for?

191
00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:51,456
No, Genta! You shouldn't ring it so hard!

192
00:11:51,456 --> 00:11:55,656
But, Dad told me that I should do things like this energetically.

193
00:11:55,656 --> 00:11:57,456
Exactly!

194
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:06,856
That bell is to let god know that you've come here.

195
00:12:06,856 --> 00:12:08,756
That's why you have to ring it many times

196
00:12:08,756 --> 00:12:10,956
or else god may not notice you've come.

197
00:12:10,956 --> 00:12:13,356
-Oh. -I didn't know that.

198
00:12:13,356 --> 00:12:15,356
Okay!

199
00:12:15,356 --> 00:12:18,456
I'll ring it with all my might then!

200
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:22,556
-Hey. -Huh?

201
00:12:22,556 --> 00:12:23,756
The man you were talking about a while ago,

202
00:12:23,756 --> 00:12:26,356
that man called Akai, who is he?

203
00:12:26,356 --> 00:12:27,556
Why?

204
00:12:27,556 --> 00:12:32,556
Somehow he sounds like someone I know.

205
00:12:32,556 --> 00:12:35,256
Maybe not.

206
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:37,256
Besides Mr. Akai is already...

207
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,456
Huh, dead?

208
00:12:40,356 --> 00:12:42,156
-No joke? -Yeah!

209
00:12:42,156 --> 00:12:45,156
There's a big fuss behind the restroom!

210
00:12:45,156 --> 00:12:46,756
Let's go look!

211
00:12:50,656 --> 00:12:52,856
Doc? What's up?

212
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:56,256
Bad news, Shinichi! It's a homicide!

213
00:12:56,256 --> 00:13:00,056
I seem to have witnessed a murder!

214
00:13:00,056 --> 00:13:03,556
What? You witnessed a murder?

215
00:13:03,556 --> 00:13:05,556
At any rate, rush over here, will you!

216
00:13:05,556 --> 00:13:07,856
They're a lot of spectators here already.

217
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:10,356
I'm sure you'll find the place right away!

218
00:13:14,556 --> 00:13:16,256
Over there!

219
00:13:19,156 --> 00:13:21,956
And, did you see the perp?

220
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:24,356
I only got to see the silhouette,

221
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:26,056
but the perp was flinging a stick about 30cm

222
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:28,756
and hitting the victim repeatedly.

223
00:13:28,756 --> 00:13:32,256
A stick about 30cm long? Slugged to death!

224
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,756
Hey.

225
00:13:36,756 --> 00:13:38,956
Out of the way, move!

226
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,856
This person.

227
00:13:48,056 --> 00:13:49,156
No joke?

228
00:13:49,156 --> 00:13:52,356
She's the one that bumped into Jodie a while ago.

229
00:13:52,356 --> 00:13:54,056
Why?

230
00:13:54,056 --> 00:13:57,856
Not much time seems to have gone by since she was killed.

231
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:02,456
A 5 yen coin painted black with a Sharpie.

232
00:14:02,856 --> 00:14:04,756
'Kurobei'!

233
00:14:04,756 --> 00:14:06,356
'Kurobei'?

234
00:14:06,356 --> 00:14:08,156
The nickname of this pickpocket.

235
00:14:08,156 --> 00:14:10,056
She's called by that name because

236
00:14:10,056 --> 00:14:12,956
she sneaks three black 5 yen coins into the pockets

237
00:14:12,956 --> 00:14:14,556
of those she pickpockets.

238
00:14:14,556 --> 00:14:16,456
Why do something like that?

239
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:18,456
It's rumored to be a play on words.

240
00:14:18,456 --> 00:14:19,956
The five (go) for a 5 yen coin,

241
00:14:19,956 --> 00:14:23,156
the black (kuro) color of the Sharpie, and 3 (san) coins

242
00:14:23,156 --> 00:14:25,556
make up the word "gokurosan" (Thank you).

243
00:14:25,556 --> 00:14:27,756
In other words, thank you for earning money for me

244
00:14:27,756 --> 00:14:30,356
to pickpocket from you.

245
00:14:30,356 --> 00:14:32,756
Officer, this way, this way!

246
00:14:32,756 --> 00:14:33,756
Doc!

247
00:14:33,756 --> 00:14:36,356
Huh? Who are you children?

248
00:14:36,356 --> 00:14:38,156
Get away from the corpse!

249
00:14:38,156 --> 00:14:43,556
I'm an FBI agent Jodie Starling!

250
00:14:43,556 --> 00:14:45,556
FBI?

251
00:14:45,556 --> 00:14:48,556
Block the entrance and exit of this shrine immediately!

252
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:52,056
-Get the police detectives. -Yes, ma'am!

253
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:55,256
Then, the perp is that person called Kurobei?

254
00:14:55,256 --> 00:14:56,356
No.

255
00:14:56,356 --> 00:14:59,256
Since the coin purse that she had on her

256
00:14:59,256 --> 00:15:02,956
was filled with black painted coins.

257
00:15:02,956 --> 00:15:07,156
She's probably Kurobei herself!

258
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,156
-Huh? -This pack of bills

259
00:15:09,156 --> 00:15:14,156
that's bundled together with a rubber band inside her wallet.

260
00:15:14,156 --> 00:15:15,456
Inside it...

261
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,056
This is a GPS transmitter.

262
00:15:18,056 --> 00:15:19,756
Transmitter?

263
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:22,156
If a cell phone is used with only a discrepancy of five meters,

264
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:23,256
the location can be specified.

265
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,056
If a thing like that were inside the wallet

266
00:15:26,056 --> 00:15:29,056
wrapped inside a pack of bills of a pickpocket...

267
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:33,556
Yeah. The one who was pickpocketed by Kurobei

268
00:15:33,556 --> 00:15:35,456
is probably the killer!

269
00:15:41,256 --> 00:15:43,456
We give out the orders, Jodie.

270
00:15:43,456 --> 00:15:47,856
You may be a FBI agent but this is Japan, you know.

271
00:15:47,856 --> 00:15:52,256
Moreover, you're here on vacation, aren't you?

272
00:15:52,256 --> 00:15:54,156
With you going around giving out orders on your own,

273
00:15:54,156 --> 00:15:56,956
we'll lose face.

274
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,556
I'm sorry.

275
00:15:58,556 --> 00:16:01,356
My usual habit took command of me.

276
00:16:01,356 --> 00:16:05,056
But, this site is far from the entrance or exit of the shrine.

277
00:16:05,056 --> 00:16:10,256
Not too much time had passed since the victim was killed.

278
00:16:10,256 --> 00:16:12,856
So by closing off the entrance and exit of the shrine,

279
00:16:12,856 --> 00:16:15,356
I'm sure the perp has been contained.

280
00:16:15,356 --> 00:16:18,556
Right, Conan?

281
00:16:18,556 --> 00:16:21,856
Well, it's true that you did the right thing,

282
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,356
and it helped us out but...

283
00:16:23,356 --> 00:16:26,556
But, is it true?

284
00:16:26,556 --> 00:16:28,756
That this woman who was slugged to death

285
00:16:28,756 --> 00:16:29,756
was who the 3rd investigation division's

286
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:31,356
been pursuing all these years,

287
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:33,456
that she's the pickpocket Kurobei?

288
00:16:33,456 --> 00:16:35,456
I think there's no mistake about it.

289
00:16:35,456 --> 00:16:38,856
In the coin purse that she had on her,

290
00:16:38,856 --> 00:16:42,956
there were a lot of black painted 5 yen coins.

291
00:16:42,956 --> 00:16:45,356
It seems that Kurobei actually did leave

292
00:16:45,356 --> 00:16:48,056
three black painted 5 yen coins in the pockets

293
00:16:48,056 --> 00:16:50,056
of those she pickpocketed but...

294
00:16:51,356 --> 00:16:52,756
And?

295
00:16:52,756 --> 00:16:54,856
Is it true that you witnessed Kurobei

296
00:16:54,856 --> 00:16:57,556
being slugged to death, Dr. Agasa?

297
00:16:57,556 --> 00:16:59,356
Yes.

298
00:16:59,356 --> 00:17:02,656
I happened to witness it when I came out here

299
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:04,756
after using the restroom.

300
00:17:04,756 --> 00:17:06,756
Since this place is in the shade of the tree and dark,

301
00:17:06,756 --> 00:17:10,856
at first I thought that someone was just hammering something.

302
00:17:10,856 --> 00:17:12,756
Did you see the perp's face?

303
00:17:12,756 --> 00:17:15,856
It was mostly all silhouetted.

304
00:17:15,856 --> 00:17:18,256
What I'm sure of is that the perp was wearing a hat,

305
00:17:18,256 --> 00:17:22,856
and also was holding a thin stick about 30cm long.

306
00:17:22,856 --> 00:17:26,356
I see. So, that's the murder weapon.

307
00:17:26,356 --> 00:17:28,956
Any other characteristics of the perp?

308
00:17:28,956 --> 00:17:30,756
Let's see.

309
00:17:30,756 --> 00:17:33,856
Oh, come to think of it, when the perp left,

310
00:17:33,856 --> 00:17:36,556
he was dragging his leg a bit!

311
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,656
So, I called out to ask if he was okay.

312
00:17:39,656 --> 00:17:41,656
Dragging his leg?

313
00:17:41,656 --> 00:17:43,756
And, what about the perp?

314
00:17:43,756 --> 00:17:46,156
He ignored me and left.

315
00:17:46,156 --> 00:17:51,056
By the time I found out that the perp had slugged a woman,

316
00:17:51,056 --> 00:17:52,856
he had already disappeared into the crowd.

317
00:17:52,856 --> 00:17:54,856
I see.

318
00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:55,956
Inspector.

319
00:17:55,956 --> 00:17:58,856
If the perp wanted to get out of here as fast as possible

320
00:17:58,856 --> 00:18:01,256
and the perp was dragging his leg...

321
00:18:01,256 --> 00:18:04,156
It doesn't seem to be an act

322
00:18:04,156 --> 00:18:06,656
to make it off the suspect's list.

323
00:18:06,656 --> 00:18:11,056
But, with only that to go on, it'll be more than difficult

324
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,756
to figure out who did it from among this crowd of flower viewers...

325
00:18:13,756 --> 00:18:16,756
That's close to impossible to do.

326
00:18:16,756 --> 00:18:19,556
I think you can narrow down the target a bit more.

327
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:24,156
There was something strange in that lady's wallet too.

328
00:18:24,156 --> 00:18:25,356
Something strange?

329
00:18:25,356 --> 00:18:28,656
A GPS transmitter wrapped inside the bills!

330
00:18:28,656 --> 00:18:30,856
Why would something like that be...

331
00:18:30,856 --> 00:18:34,456
If that pickpocket Kurobei was never caught,

332
00:18:34,456 --> 00:18:36,256
it would be impossible to identify Kurobei

333
00:18:36,256 --> 00:18:38,156
until the 5 yen coins painted black

334
00:18:38,156 --> 00:18:40,656
are put into the pocket of the person who was pickpocketed!

335
00:18:40,656 --> 00:18:43,156
So, by making Kurobei deliberately pickpocket

336
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:44,656
a wallet with the GPS transmitter inside, the perp,

337
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:46,956
after locating the whereabouts of Kurobei using a cell phone,

338
00:18:46,956 --> 00:18:49,956
waits for Kurobei to go to a lonely place

339
00:18:49,956 --> 00:18:51,556
then slugs her to death!

340
00:18:51,556 --> 00:18:55,656
Then the one who was pickpocketed by Kurobei's the perp?

341
00:18:55,656 --> 00:18:58,756
But, pickpockets frequently work in groups too.

342
00:18:58,756 --> 00:19:02,456
So it could be that they got into a fight and...

343
00:19:02,456 --> 00:19:03,856
True.

344
00:19:03,856 --> 00:19:06,656
I think Kurobei worked alone.

345
00:19:06,656 --> 00:19:09,656
She herself, shouted, "Pickpocket!"

346
00:19:09,656 --> 00:19:12,056
Huh? Just what do you mean?

347
00:19:12,056 --> 00:19:14,256
It's a trick that most pickpockets use!

348
00:19:14,256 --> 00:19:15,856
When you hear that a pickpocket is around,

349
00:19:15,856 --> 00:19:18,956
most people check their wallets, don't they?

350
00:19:18,956 --> 00:19:20,956
That's how pickpockets figure out where their targets

351
00:19:20,956 --> 00:19:23,156
keep their wallets.

352
00:19:23,156 --> 00:19:24,656
And, if she had an accomplice,

353
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:28,156
she'd make the accomplice do that part, right?

354
00:19:28,156 --> 00:19:32,656
That's why I think she also took your wallet, Jodie.

355
00:19:32,656 --> 00:19:35,856
Oh! My wallet's gone!

356
00:19:35,856 --> 00:19:41,256
She probably took it when you helped her up!

357
00:19:44,156 --> 00:19:48,556
But with the pickpocket dead...

358
00:19:48,556 --> 00:19:50,756
How on earth do we go about looking for the victims

359
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,656
who were pickpocketed?

360
00:19:52,656 --> 00:19:55,056
As to that, I think that soon...

361
00:19:58,956 --> 00:20:01,956
Conan, we found it!

362
00:20:01,956 --> 00:20:04,956
Inside the trash can that was on the side of

363
00:20:04,956 --> 00:20:06,456
where the oracles are tied!

364
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,956
I also found one!

365
00:20:08,956 --> 00:20:12,856
Inside the trash can near the place I drank the water!

366
00:20:12,856 --> 00:20:15,756
Oh! Found another one!

367
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,856
Inside the trash can of the place where the bell is rung!

368
00:20:18,856 --> 00:20:22,556
The shrine owner is taking it for me now!

369
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,356
Here, it was inside the trash can a bit ahead

370
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,456
of the toilet that was the crime scene.

371
00:20:26,456 --> 00:20:28,356
They were about to collect the trash,

372
00:20:28,356 --> 00:20:30,756
but I asked them to let me search the trash first.

373
00:20:30,756 --> 00:20:32,956
Okay, then bring the wallets you found

374
00:20:32,956 --> 00:20:35,056
without putting your fingerprints on them!

375
00:20:35,056 --> 00:20:37,256
-Okay! -Copy.

376
00:20:37,256 --> 00:20:39,256
Right, the wallets!

377
00:20:39,256 --> 00:20:41,056
Pickpockets remove only the money

378
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:42,856
and dispose of the wallets,

379
00:20:42,856 --> 00:20:45,756
so if we search the contents of the wallets...

380
00:20:45,756 --> 00:20:49,556
We could maybe find the owners of the wallets.

381
00:20:49,556 --> 00:20:50,956
Yes!

382
00:20:54,856 --> 00:20:58,356
Are these four wallets all that you found in the trash cans?

383
00:20:58,356 --> 00:21:01,256
Yes, because the workers said they started

384
00:21:01,256 --> 00:21:02,756
collecting trash from the trash can

385
00:21:02,756 --> 00:21:04,556
that I was searching.

386
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:07,556
Oh, that blue wallet is mine!

387
00:21:07,556 --> 00:21:10,156
Then, you're one of the suspects too.

388
00:21:10,156 --> 00:21:11,156
What?

389
00:21:11,156 --> 00:21:13,356
No, Jodie's not!

390
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:15,356
She was with us right through

391
00:21:15,356 --> 00:21:17,656
after she bumped into that lady!

392
00:21:17,656 --> 00:21:20,456
She had no time to kill anybody!

393
00:21:20,456 --> 00:21:23,256
Oh, is that so?

394
00:21:24,456 --> 00:21:26,456
If so, the killer

395
00:21:26,456 --> 00:21:28,956
is highly likely to be one of the owners

396
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:31,556
of the three wallets that are left.

397
00:21:33,756 --> 00:21:38,056
Oh! Maybe the owner of this wallet can be found right away

398
00:21:38,056 --> 00:21:40,456
since there's a driver's license inside.

399
00:21:40,456 --> 00:21:43,656
Yeah! I saw this man a while ago.

400
00:21:43,656 --> 00:21:45,556
-Huh? -He's the one

401
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:47,456
who came to talk to Jodie!

402
00:21:47,456 --> 00:21:50,256
He said he had a cold and was wearing a mask!

403
00:21:50,256 --> 00:21:52,256
I see.

404
00:21:54,156 --> 00:21:55,956
It seems that the only wallet with a driver's license inside

405
00:21:55,956 --> 00:21:59,056
is just this black wallet though.

406
00:21:59,056 --> 00:22:00,256
A photo?

407
00:22:00,256 --> 00:22:04,156
I know her too!

408
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,156
What?

409
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:08,056
She taught us how to ring the bell!

410
00:22:08,056 --> 00:22:10,856
I think she's still around some place.

411
00:22:12,556 --> 00:22:16,756
In the last red wallet, the only thing inside

412
00:22:16,756 --> 00:22:19,756
is an oracle that says "little lucky".

413
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:23,756
I guess the owner of this wallet won't be found.

414
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:26,456
I think it's that old man's wallet.

415
00:22:26,456 --> 00:22:29,156
He said that lucky oracles should be taken home.

416
00:22:29,156 --> 00:22:32,056
Yes. Besides, I saw!

417
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:33,156
He was in front of us

418
00:22:33,156 --> 00:22:35,256
and took money out from that red wallet

419
00:22:35,256 --> 00:22:36,856
to buy the oracle!

420
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:39,456
Oh! I saw it too!

421
00:22:39,456 --> 00:22:40,856
We thought it was a wallet

422
00:22:40,856 --> 00:22:43,456
that didn't match an old man like him!

423
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,456
Do you know what he looks like?

424
00:22:45,456 --> 00:22:48,356
-Yep! -We'll go look for him then!

425
00:22:48,356 --> 00:22:49,856
Please wait for us to come back!

426
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,856
Hey, all of you!

427
00:22:51,856 --> 00:22:54,256
The person may be a murderer, you know!

428
00:22:54,256 --> 00:22:56,856
Officer Takagi, you go with the children!

429
00:22:56,856 --> 00:22:58,656
Yes, sir!

430
00:22:59,756 --> 00:23:04,356
If one of the three has a stick about 30cm,

431
00:23:04,356 --> 00:23:05,856
then we got the perp.

432
00:23:05,856 --> 00:23:07,556
I think you'll be able to tell right away

433
00:23:07,556 --> 00:23:09,056
even if the perp doesn't have it!

434
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:12,356
Just what do you mean, Conan?

435
00:23:12,356 --> 00:23:15,656
Because the perp left 3 painted black 5 yen coins

436
00:23:15,656 --> 00:23:19,156
near the corpse, as if to say, I'm paying you back!

437
00:23:19,156 --> 00:23:20,556
Huh?

438
00:23:20,556 --> 00:23:23,056
5 yen coins that are so unique

439
00:23:23,056 --> 00:23:26,156
are not that easy to prepare, are they?

440
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:27,656
I get it!

441
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,556
So, the person that doesn't have the black 5 yen coins

442
00:23:30,556 --> 00:23:34,556
that Kurobei would've put into his pocket is the perp!

443
00:23:34,556 --> 00:23:36,656
Right!

444
00:24:03,873 --> 00:24:06,073
Hey, what is it?

445
00:24:06,073 --> 00:24:10,773
What do you officers want to ask us so suddenly?

446
00:24:10,773 --> 00:24:13,773
Are you saying we did something?

447
00:24:13,773 --> 00:24:16,373
Before we go any further, first of all,

448
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:20,773
please let us check to see if in your pockets or bags,

449
00:24:20,773 --> 00:24:24,873
you have any 5 yen coins that are painted black?

450
00:24:24,873 --> 00:24:27,273
5 yen coins that are painted black?

451
00:24:27,273 --> 00:24:29,173
What's that about?

452
00:24:29,173 --> 00:24:32,373
Why would I have something so strange like...

453
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:36,073
Why is something like this...

454
00:24:36,073 --> 00:24:39,473
I found it, black 5 yen coins.

455
00:24:40,773 --> 00:24:43,873
-I've found one too. -Me too.

456
00:24:44,873 --> 00:24:46,473
This is...

457
00:24:46,473 --> 00:24:49,673
You mean all three have it?

458
00:24:49,673 --> 00:24:51,273
What on earth is going on?

459
00:24:51,273 --> 00:24:53,473
What's this grotesque 5 yen coin about?

460
00:24:53,473 --> 00:24:56,273
That's what the pickpocket Kurobei

461
00:24:56,273 --> 00:24:57,973
left behind for you as a gift, you see.

462
00:24:57,973 --> 00:25:01,973
Huh? No joke? Then you mean I was pickpocketed?

463
00:25:01,973 --> 00:25:07,473
Oh. I realized a while ago that I didn't have my wallet

464
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:10,173
and was just about to report it to the police.

465
00:25:10,173 --> 00:25:13,673
Well, I didn't have much inside anyway,

466
00:25:13,673 --> 00:25:16,073
so she could go ahead and take it, but...

467
00:25:16,073 --> 00:25:18,073
Did you nab that pickpocket?

468
00:25:18,073 --> 00:25:20,073
No, not really.

469
00:25:20,073 --> 00:25:23,973
Just a while ago, she was found dead.

470
00:25:23,973 --> 00:25:25,673
What?

471
00:25:25,673 --> 00:25:30,673
We think that one of you is the perp.

472
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,473
One of us?

473
00:25:33,473 --> 00:25:34,873
No.

474
00:25:34,873 --> 00:25:37,473
You mean we're not victims?

475
00:25:37,473 --> 00:25:40,773
We'll start with a body check of all of you

476
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:44,573
then check your belongings and cell phone.

477
00:25:45,473 --> 00:25:48,573
Of course, this is voluntary so you may reject this.

478
00:25:48,573 --> 00:25:53,073
Only if you do reject, I think you'll have more problems later.

479
00:25:53,073 --> 00:25:55,973
-So if at all possible... -Okay!

480
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:58,273
Go on and check me if you want to!

481
00:25:58,273 --> 00:25:59,873
But, mind you,

482
00:25:59,873 --> 00:26:02,973
I'm fat, so my cell phone may be sticky.

483
00:26:02,973 --> 00:26:04,773
Put up with that, will you?

484
00:26:05,573 --> 00:26:07,873
Jodie?

485
00:26:07,873 --> 00:26:09,773
Did you notice something?

486
00:26:09,773 --> 00:26:14,073
No. I was just recalling a man from a video

487
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,873
you previously took for me.

488
00:26:15,873 --> 00:26:18,173
Remember, the time when we deliberately dropped our cell phone

489
00:26:18,173 --> 00:26:20,673
and made them pick it up to figure out who the spy

490
00:26:20,673 --> 00:26:23,873
the Organization snuck into the hospital was?

491
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:26,473
The first one who picked it up

492
00:26:26,473 --> 00:26:28,973
was an oily skinned fat man.

493
00:26:28,973 --> 00:26:32,773
But the one who picked it up after him was the spy,

494
00:26:32,773 --> 00:26:36,373
and the last one, an old man had a pace maker imbedded.

495
00:26:36,373 --> 00:26:40,373
And that cell phone... Shu...

496
00:26:41,173 --> 00:26:45,573
Why don't we take her on the car of an acquaintance of mine?

497
00:26:45,573 --> 00:26:48,773
-Huh? -We could lie her down in the backseat.

498
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,673
Because those bad buys probably think that

499
00:26:51,673 --> 00:26:53,573
she's going to be carried off in a large car

500
00:26:53,573 --> 00:26:55,273
that can accommodate a stretcher.

501
00:26:55,273 --> 00:26:57,273
I think they'll never find out!

502
00:26:57,273 --> 00:26:59,673
I guess so, but...

503
00:26:59,673 --> 00:27:02,973
I'll go outside and call him then.

504
00:27:02,973 --> 00:27:04,973
I'm sure he'll come right away.

505
00:27:07,073 --> 00:27:11,673
That's something I can't do, not even for you, sonny.

506
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:14,773
This is a job for the FBI.

507
00:27:15,773 --> 00:27:18,073
We can't afford to get ordinary citizens

508
00:27:18,073 --> 00:27:20,073
involved in something like this anymore.

509
00:27:20,073 --> 00:27:22,373
Oh, but...

510
00:27:22,373 --> 00:27:24,973
Leave the rest to us.

511
00:27:25,473 --> 00:27:28,373
Jodie?

512
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:32,273
That's not of any concern now, is it?

513
00:27:32,273 --> 00:27:34,173
I guess so.

514
00:27:34,173 --> 00:27:35,873
I'm sorry.

515
00:27:35,873 --> 00:27:37,773
I think I'm a bit flustered at finding out

516
00:27:37,773 --> 00:27:42,173
that the man with the burn wasn't Shu.

517
00:27:42,173 --> 00:27:43,873
I've got to shape up.

518
00:27:43,873 --> 00:27:45,973
What's the matter?

519
00:27:45,973 --> 00:27:48,173
Raising your voice suddenly like that.

520
00:27:48,173 --> 00:27:51,073
Oh, no. It's nothing.

521
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:56,573
And how about it, Doc?

522
00:27:56,573 --> 00:28:00,573
Is the perp that you saw among the three?

523
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:06,973
Well, that old man with the cane is suspicious I guess,

524
00:28:06,973 --> 00:28:11,373
but the perp had a thin stick about 30cm.

525
00:28:11,373 --> 00:28:13,973
He wasn't using a cane, either.

526
00:28:13,973 --> 00:28:16,073
The hat that the perp was wearing

527
00:28:16,073 --> 00:28:18,073
was not a hunting cap that old people would wear

528
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:20,173
or a knitted cap for women,

529
00:28:20,173 --> 00:28:22,473
but rather, a mountain climbing hat.

530
00:28:22,873 --> 00:28:27,673
Besides, the perp didn't have a cough like that man.

531
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:31,873
But, maybe he's just pretending to have a cold?

532
00:28:31,873 --> 00:28:33,873
I don't think so.

533
00:28:33,873 --> 00:28:36,473
At the point we met him for the first time,

534
00:28:36,473 --> 00:28:40,473
he had no way of knowing that we were acquaintances of Doc.

535
00:28:40,473 --> 00:28:42,073
So, he wouldn't have needed to pretend

536
00:28:42,073 --> 00:28:45,273
that he had a cold in front of us, right?

537
00:28:45,273 --> 00:28:48,073
Well, I guess so.

538
00:28:48,073 --> 00:28:51,373
Then Doctor, how about the style of walking?

539
00:28:51,373 --> 00:28:56,273
You said the perp was dragging his legs a bit, no?

540
00:28:56,273 --> 00:28:59,173
That old man, rather than drag his leg,

541
00:28:59,173 --> 00:29:02,973
seems unable to stand without a cane.

542
00:29:02,973 --> 00:29:06,973
The other two don't look to be dragging their legs either.

543
00:29:09,673 --> 00:29:12,773
What? You can't find the murder weapon?

544
00:29:12,773 --> 00:29:14,573
Did you look in every crevice and cranny?

545
00:29:14,573 --> 00:29:17,473
Yes, sir. We looked inside the drain of the water spot,

546
00:29:17,473 --> 00:29:20,473
and even inside the offertory box.

547
00:29:20,473 --> 00:29:23,273
Those three didn't have any, did they?

548
00:29:23,273 --> 00:29:26,673
No! We even checked the old man's cane

549
00:29:26,673 --> 00:29:28,273
but there were no traces of it having been used

550
00:29:28,273 --> 00:29:29,373
as a murder weapon.

551
00:29:29,373 --> 00:29:32,673
Besides, we checked the cell phones of the three

552
00:29:32,673 --> 00:29:35,873
but none of the cell phones had an application that enables

553
00:29:35,873 --> 00:29:37,673
pursuit of a transmitter.

554
00:29:37,673 --> 00:29:42,473
Maybe it was deleted to prevent us from finding it, though.

555
00:29:42,473 --> 00:29:43,573
Yes.

556
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:47,673
But, to check any further, we need a warrant.

557
00:29:47,673 --> 00:29:49,473
Hey, you guys!

558
00:29:49,473 --> 00:29:53,773
When you met those three, did anyone of them act strange?

559
00:29:53,773 --> 00:29:55,773
Act strange?

560
00:29:55,773 --> 00:29:57,673
For example, like somebody coming,

561
00:29:57,673 --> 00:30:01,573
to secretly give them what looked to be a thin stick?

562
00:30:01,573 --> 00:30:03,673
All three of them were by themselves!

563
00:30:03,673 --> 00:30:07,773
The old man taught us to take home the oracle

564
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:09,273
if the result was good too.

565
00:30:09,273 --> 00:30:13,773
That lady told us to ring the bell loudly

566
00:30:13,773 --> 00:30:16,573
so that god could hear us!

567
00:30:16,573 --> 00:30:18,173
The other man,

568
00:30:18,173 --> 00:30:21,773
said that he already cleansed his hands at the water spot.

569
00:30:21,773 --> 00:30:23,873
It seems he was at the shrine way

570
00:30:23,873 --> 00:30:26,673
before we got here though.

571
00:30:27,973 --> 00:30:29,673
Inspector Megure!

572
00:30:29,673 --> 00:30:32,973
We found the hat and coat that could be the perp's!

573
00:30:32,973 --> 00:30:34,973
Oh, is that so!

574
00:30:34,973 --> 00:30:36,573
There's probably no mistake about it,

575
00:30:36,573 --> 00:30:38,673
because blood is splattered on it.

576
00:30:39,473 --> 00:30:42,073
But it's covered with flower petals.

577
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:44,573
Yes. It was covered with withered petals

578
00:30:44,573 --> 00:30:46,773
as if to hide it.

579
00:30:46,773 --> 00:30:48,073
What?

580
00:30:48,073 --> 00:30:51,373
Then, maybe the murder weapon is hidden in the same way!

581
00:30:51,373 --> 00:30:53,873
Find it even if you have to scatter the flower petals!

582
00:30:53,873 --> 00:30:55,573
Yes, sir!

583
00:30:56,573 --> 00:31:01,273
What? I mean it looks like a nice pink carpet, and yet!

584
00:31:01,273 --> 00:31:02,673
True.

585
00:31:02,673 --> 00:31:05,373
If you look at them one by one, they're flower petals,

586
00:31:05,373 --> 00:31:06,973
and yet when many of them are scattered over the ground,

587
00:31:06,973 --> 00:31:09,273
they look just like one pink carpet.

588
00:31:09,273 --> 00:31:10,673
Yep.

589
00:31:11,873 --> 00:31:14,673
I see. So, that's the story.

590
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:15,673
That's why that person

591
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:19,073
said something like that to the children.

592
00:31:19,073 --> 00:31:22,473
If so, the reason the perp was dragging his foot

593
00:31:22,473 --> 00:31:24,773
was probably because...

594
00:31:24,773 --> 00:31:28,773
It seems that he got to the truth of the case but...

595
00:31:28,773 --> 00:31:33,073
isn't aware of ours.

596
00:31:48,265 --> 00:31:51,065
Hey, how long do you intend to keep us stranded here?

597
00:31:51,065 --> 00:31:53,165
The sun's starting to set already!

598
00:31:53,165 --> 00:31:55,865
I don't know if you're working on a case or what but...

599
00:31:55,865 --> 00:31:58,265
It has nothing to do with us, right?

600
00:31:58,265 --> 00:32:01,765
We're very sorry. Please give us a little more time.

601
00:32:01,765 --> 00:32:03,465
Inspector Megure!

602
00:32:06,365 --> 00:32:09,865
We've got to open the doorways of the shrine already.

603
00:32:09,865 --> 00:32:11,165
I see.

604
00:32:11,165 --> 00:32:12,765
And, the murder weapon?

605
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:16,865
Too bad, but we haven't got word that it's been found yet.

606
00:32:16,865 --> 00:32:19,965
Maybe the perp already fled this shrine

607
00:32:19,965 --> 00:32:23,065
and took the murder weapon along too.

608
00:32:23,065 --> 00:32:25,265
No, because taking into consideration,

609
00:32:25,265 --> 00:32:26,265
the time from when the incident occurred

610
00:32:26,265 --> 00:32:27,965
and entrance and exit were closed off,

611
00:32:27,965 --> 00:32:32,365
as well as the perp dragging his leg while leaving.

612
00:32:32,365 --> 00:32:34,065
It's highly likely that the perp

613
00:32:34,065 --> 00:32:36,665
is still on the grounds of this shrine!

614
00:32:36,665 --> 00:32:39,165
And that the stick that's about 30cm that Mr. Agasa witnessed

615
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:43,465
the perp having, is hidden somewhere here too!

616
00:32:43,465 --> 00:32:45,765
If so, the most suspicious

617
00:32:45,765 --> 00:32:48,865
are those three victims of pickpocket.

618
00:32:48,865 --> 00:32:50,065
Yeah.

619
00:32:50,065 --> 00:32:52,365
If there was a GPS wrapped in the bills

620
00:32:52,365 --> 00:32:56,865
of the wallet of the pickpocket who was slugged to death...

621
00:32:56,865 --> 00:33:00,165
Just as Jodie mentioned, the suspect deliberately

622
00:33:00,165 --> 00:33:02,565
made the pickpocket steal the wallet with the GPS inside,

623
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:06,665
in order to slug her to death in a lonely place.

624
00:33:06,665 --> 00:33:11,365
But, those three, don't look to have hurt their legs.

625
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:14,065
Besides, the old man, rather than dragging his feet,

626
00:33:14,065 --> 00:33:16,665
cannot walk without his cane.

627
00:33:16,665 --> 00:33:19,865
And moreover, if the perp had an accomplice

628
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:22,965
who he secretly passed the murder weapon onto,

629
00:33:22,965 --> 00:33:25,165
it would have to be one of the flower viewers here.

630
00:33:25,165 --> 00:33:27,465
We'd have to check all of them.

631
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:29,965
That won't be necessary.

632
00:33:29,965 --> 00:33:34,165
The perp still has a part of the weapon hidden on him!

633
00:33:34,165 --> 00:33:35,665
A part of it?

634
00:33:35,665 --> 00:33:37,165
Oh, that's right!

635
00:33:37,165 --> 00:33:39,265
The perp bundled that stuff together

636
00:33:39,265 --> 00:33:41,065
and made the murder weapon!

637
00:33:41,065 --> 00:33:43,265
Bundled?

638
00:33:43,265 --> 00:33:45,065
The murder weapon that you saw, Mr. Agasa

639
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,765
was a stick, wasn't it?

640
00:33:46,765 --> 00:33:48,465
What does bundle have to do with it?

641
00:33:48,465 --> 00:33:53,165
The perp bundled it into one. A lot of a certain thing!

642
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:54,665
And, the perp hid it in a place where it

643
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,265
wouldn't look suspicious

644
00:33:56,265 --> 00:33:58,965
even if there were a lot of it around.

645
00:33:58,965 --> 00:34:00,965
He called out to the children

646
00:34:00,965 --> 00:34:03,765
and nicely set up a camouflage too.

647
00:34:03,765 --> 00:34:06,665
-Huh? -You mean to us?

648
00:34:06,665 --> 00:34:08,365
Then, are you talking about that old man

649
00:34:08,365 --> 00:34:10,965
who talked to us at the location where the oracles were tied?

650
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:14,265
Come to think of it, there were a lot of oracles tied on,

651
00:34:14,265 --> 00:34:16,865
so no one would know the difference if more were added, right?

652
00:34:16,865 --> 00:34:19,565
But no matter how many oracles you bundle together,

653
00:34:19,565 --> 00:34:20,765
you could never make a murder weapon

654
00:34:20,765 --> 00:34:23,365
enough to slug a person to death with.

655
00:34:23,365 --> 00:34:25,565
It's only paper after all.

656
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:27,365
Then, is it that man?

657
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:28,565
The one who said he didn't need the scoopers

658
00:34:28,565 --> 00:34:32,365
that Genta handed to him at the water spot.

659
00:34:32,365 --> 00:34:35,065
I'm sure it was him!

660
00:34:35,065 --> 00:34:38,665
There were many scoopers at the water spot too!

661
00:34:38,665 --> 00:34:42,765
If there was a scooper made of iron among them...

662
00:34:42,765 --> 00:34:46,565
The police would've found it long ago.

663
00:34:46,565 --> 00:34:48,065
I guess so.

664
00:34:48,065 --> 00:34:51,065
Of course there was no such scoopers.

665
00:34:51,065 --> 00:34:53,665
The only one left is that lady we saw at the place

666
00:34:53,665 --> 00:34:56,065
to ring the bell.

667
00:34:56,065 --> 00:34:59,765
But, there were only two bells!

668
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:03,265
Didn't you guys do something before you rang the bell?

669
00:35:04,065 --> 00:35:06,465
-I see! -We threw in money offering.

670
00:35:06,465 --> 00:35:08,465
We put in 5 yen coins!

671
00:35:08,465 --> 00:35:10,265
Inside the offertory box!

672
00:35:10,265 --> 00:35:13,565
Right. Offerings usually made by throwing in 5 yen coins,

673
00:35:13,565 --> 00:35:15,965
because they symbolize "goen" meaning good ties with others.

674
00:35:15,965 --> 00:35:18,065
That's why most of the coins are 5 yen coins with holes in them!

675
00:35:18,065 --> 00:35:19,565
I see.

676
00:35:19,565 --> 00:35:21,865
If you join all the coins by pulling a string or wire

677
00:35:21,865 --> 00:35:23,765
through them and bundle them together,

678
00:35:23,765 --> 00:35:25,665
you can make a thin long stick.

679
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,265
On top of that, even if a lot of 5 yen coins

680
00:35:28,265 --> 00:35:31,865
were to later be found in the offertory box,

681
00:35:31,865 --> 00:35:33,165
they would be mixed with other monetary offerings

682
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:34,565
so it wouldn't look suspicious.

683
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:36,765
The perp can deceive the eyes of the police

684
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:39,765
who are set on looking for a thin long metal stick!

685
00:35:39,765 --> 00:35:43,165
But in order to make a stick as long as 30cm,

686
00:35:43,165 --> 00:35:45,965
you'll need around 200 five yen coins.

687
00:35:45,965 --> 00:35:49,365
Besides, if you throw in that many coins at once,

688
00:35:49,365 --> 00:35:52,065
the people around will get suspicious, won't they?

689
00:35:52,065 --> 00:35:56,165
That's why the perp called out to the children

690
00:35:56,165 --> 00:35:58,765
and told them that unless they ring the bell loudly,

691
00:35:58,765 --> 00:36:00,865
god won't hear them.

692
00:36:00,865 --> 00:36:02,565
Then...

693
00:36:02,565 --> 00:36:04,465
The perp is...

694
00:36:04,465 --> 00:36:05,765
That's right.

695
00:36:05,765 --> 00:36:09,065
The one who hid a GPS transmitter into the wallet

696
00:36:09,065 --> 00:36:11,065
to confirm the whereabouts of the pickpocket,

697
00:36:11,065 --> 00:36:12,465
then used a lot of 5 yen coins by bundling them

698
00:36:12,465 --> 00:36:14,765
into the form of a stick to make the murder weapon,

699
00:36:14,765 --> 00:36:16,765
then finally slugged Ms. Ikuyo Yatani,

700
00:36:16,765 --> 00:36:21,265
so-called pickpocket Kurobei, to death is...

701
00:36:21,265 --> 00:36:22,865
you!

702
00:36:43,278 --> 00:36:44,978
Then...

703
00:36:44,978 --> 00:36:46,578
The perp is...

704
00:36:46,578 --> 00:36:47,878
That's right.

705
00:36:47,878 --> 00:36:51,278
The one who hid a GPS transmitter into the wallet

706
00:36:51,278 --> 00:36:53,278
to confirm the whereabouts of the pickpocket,

707
00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:54,678
then used a lot of 5 yen coins by bundling them

708
00:36:54,678 --> 00:36:56,978
into the form of a stick to make the murder weapon,

709
00:36:56,978 --> 00:36:58,878
then finally slugged Ms. Ikuyo Yatani,

710
00:36:58,878 --> 00:37:02,878
so-called pickpocket Kurobei, to death is...

711
00:37:02,878 --> 00:37:04,678
you!

712
00:37:04,678 --> 00:37:06,478
Ms. Yoriko Danno!

713
00:37:06,478 --> 00:37:08,978
You called out to the children

714
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:11,778
and made them ring the bell very loudly,

715
00:37:11,778 --> 00:37:14,878
and erased the sound of the load of 5 yen coins

716
00:37:14,878 --> 00:37:17,778
being put into the offertory box!

717
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:19,178
You untied the tip of the string

718
00:37:19,178 --> 00:37:21,178
that bundled the 5 yen coins together,

719
00:37:21,178 --> 00:37:22,678
held the edge of the string

720
00:37:22,678 --> 00:37:25,178
and hung it down in the offertory box.

721
00:37:25,178 --> 00:37:29,478
In this way you slid the load of coins into the box at once.

722
00:37:29,478 --> 00:37:32,278
Moreover, the murder was committed

723
00:37:32,278 --> 00:37:34,578
before you rang the bell.

724
00:37:34,578 --> 00:37:36,678
Although by then your wallet

725
00:37:36,678 --> 00:37:39,278
should've been pickpocketed by the victim.

726
00:37:39,278 --> 00:37:41,578
You lied saying that you weren't aware this,

727
00:37:41,578 --> 00:37:44,078
threw money into the offertory box and rang the bell.

728
00:37:44,078 --> 00:37:45,478
This is proof that you're the one who did it!

729
00:37:45,478 --> 00:37:47,078
True.

730
00:37:47,078 --> 00:37:48,978
You should've noticed that you'd been pickpocketed

731
00:37:48,978 --> 00:37:51,778
at the time you opened your wallet to throw in the offering.

732
00:37:51,778 --> 00:37:53,978
Oh my, don't you know?

733
00:37:53,978 --> 00:37:55,578
A saying goes that one should not open their wallet

734
00:37:55,578 --> 00:37:58,678
in front of the offertory box.

735
00:37:58,678 --> 00:38:01,278
If god sees the contents of your wallet,

736
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:02,678
and finds that you have a lot,

737
00:38:02,678 --> 00:38:06,678
but are only giving a small offering, you may enrage him.

738
00:38:06,678 --> 00:38:09,478
That's why when I come to visit the shrine

739
00:38:09,478 --> 00:38:12,078
I keep 5 yen coins as is, in my pocket!

740
00:38:12,078 --> 00:38:15,678
I see. That's why you say you didn't realize

741
00:38:15,678 --> 00:38:17,678
that your wallet was gone?

742
00:38:17,678 --> 00:38:19,278
That's right!

743
00:38:19,278 --> 00:38:22,178
Well, if you saw me putting a load of 5 yen coins

744
00:38:22,178 --> 00:38:24,678
into the offertory box,

745
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:26,978
I wouldn't mind admitting it, though.

746
00:38:26,978 --> 00:38:29,678
We don't have to see it to prove it.

747
00:38:30,478 --> 00:38:34,378
So long as we check that shoelace of yours.

748
00:38:39,778 --> 00:38:41,578
You probably used your shoelace

749
00:38:41,578 --> 00:38:44,678
to bundle the 5 yen coins together.

750
00:38:44,678 --> 00:38:48,878
That's why you couldn't leave the site right away.

751
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:51,378
Because you were missing one of your shoelaces,

752
00:38:51,378 --> 00:38:55,078
your shoe would come off if you walked the way you usually do.

753
00:38:55,078 --> 00:38:56,678
After ringing the bell,

754
00:38:56,678 --> 00:39:00,278
it seems you put your shoelace back on and re-tied it.

755
00:39:00,278 --> 00:39:03,878
If you used that shoelace to commit the crime,

756
00:39:03,878 --> 00:39:06,278
it should be there...

757
00:39:06,278 --> 00:39:08,578
the blood of the victim that splattered

758
00:39:08,578 --> 00:39:11,678
when you slugged her to death.

759
00:39:16,078 --> 00:39:17,978
Excuse me.

760
00:39:21,178 --> 00:39:22,578
It's here.

761
00:39:22,578 --> 00:39:24,278
Blood stains.

762
00:39:26,178 --> 00:39:30,478
But, why did you have extra 5 yen coins on you?

763
00:39:30,478 --> 00:39:33,278
Weren't the 5 yen coins found near the corpse

764
00:39:33,278 --> 00:39:34,978
the ones that were put in your pocket

765
00:39:34,978 --> 00:39:37,778
when your wallet was pickpocketed?

766
00:39:37,778 --> 00:39:42,878
Those were the ones I showed you police a while ago.

767
00:39:42,878 --> 00:39:45,578
Then, what about those 5 yen coins?

768
00:39:46,178 --> 00:39:48,678
I put it near that woman because those coins

769
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:51,678
were the ones that woman put into my wallet

770
00:39:51,678 --> 00:39:54,678
when she pickpocketed me last year.

771
00:39:54,678 --> 00:39:57,778
The 5 yen coins that took the life of my son!

772
00:39:58,878 --> 00:40:00,378
Son...

773
00:40:00,378 --> 00:40:02,378
You mean the one that was in the photo

774
00:40:02,378 --> 00:40:04,478
that was in your wallet?

775
00:40:05,978 --> 00:40:08,678
Yes. That's right.

776
00:40:08,678 --> 00:40:11,678
When I was pickpocketed last year,

777
00:40:11,678 --> 00:40:14,078
my car keys were also in my wallet.

778
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,278
And, because I didn't have the keys, my son who had asthma

779
00:40:17,278 --> 00:40:19,978
was locked in the car for several hours.

780
00:40:19,978 --> 00:40:22,378
We got to the hospital too late

781
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:25,578
and as a result, he died.

782
00:40:26,578 --> 00:40:30,578
So, I checked everywhere on the internet about that pickpocket

783
00:40:30,578 --> 00:40:34,278
and ambushed her in places that she was prone to appear.

784
00:40:34,278 --> 00:40:36,978
But, why the photo?

785
00:40:36,978 --> 00:40:39,078
If it hadn't been in your wallet,

786
00:40:39,078 --> 00:40:42,678
we might not have known it was yours.

787
00:40:42,678 --> 00:40:45,478
If you try to take money out of the wallet,

788
00:40:45,478 --> 00:40:49,078
that photo would jump into your eyes, wouldn't it?

789
00:40:49,078 --> 00:40:51,178
I wanted to let her know

790
00:40:51,178 --> 00:40:53,678
that when she pickpocketed back then,

791
00:40:53,678 --> 00:40:57,278
she not only took my money.

792
00:40:57,278 --> 00:41:01,878
But, also took the life of a little boy as well.

793
00:41:07,178 --> 00:41:10,078
Then, may I go home already?

794
00:41:10,078 --> 00:41:11,178
Yes.

795
00:41:11,178 --> 00:41:12,878
I'll be going too, then.

796
00:41:12,878 --> 00:41:14,978
We're still working on the pickpocket case,

797
00:41:14,978 --> 00:41:18,378
so we may ask you some question at a later date though.

798
00:41:18,378 --> 00:41:20,278
Oh, that's okay with me.

799
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:21,878
Please contact me.

800
00:41:21,878 --> 00:41:24,178
Uh, sir!

801
00:41:24,178 --> 00:41:27,078
Do you have bad eyes, sir?

802
00:41:27,078 --> 00:41:28,878
Huh? Why do you ask?

803
00:41:28,878 --> 00:41:30,678
Because that lady pickpocket

804
00:41:30,678 --> 00:41:33,378
saw your face and looked really surprised.

805
00:41:33,378 --> 00:41:35,778
I think that was because

806
00:41:35,778 --> 00:41:39,178
she just pickpocketed your wallet a while ago.

807
00:41:39,178 --> 00:41:42,278
Why didn't you say anything back then, sir?

808
00:41:42,278 --> 00:41:44,878
In spite it being the second time you saw her.

809
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:46,778
Right.

810
00:41:46,778 --> 00:41:48,778
I've got bad eyesight, you see.

811
00:41:48,778 --> 00:41:51,278
If you got bad eyes, you can't view the cherry blossoms

812
00:41:51,278 --> 00:41:53,078
unless you wear glasses!

813
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:55,378
Did you come to view flowers alone?

814
00:41:55,378 --> 00:41:57,978
Actually I came to get lucky charms.

815
00:41:57,978 --> 00:42:00,978
What kind of lucky charms?

816
00:42:00,978 --> 00:42:03,178
For me, right?

817
00:42:03,178 --> 00:42:05,578
Motoe?

818
00:42:08,678 --> 00:42:10,178
For this child.

819
00:42:10,178 --> 00:42:11,878
I see, a baby.

820
00:42:11,878 --> 00:42:14,378
A charm to help assist a safe birth, eh?

821
00:42:14,378 --> 00:42:17,178
I told you to stay still at home, didn't I?

822
00:42:17,178 --> 00:42:19,978
I came to check on you, because you didn't come home

823
00:42:19,978 --> 00:42:21,478
and I got worried!

824
00:42:21,478 --> 00:42:23,878
Then, could you by chance be...

825
00:42:23,878 --> 00:42:28,478
the one who masking taped me during the bank robbery?

826
00:42:28,478 --> 00:42:31,678
Oh, you're that non-Japanese person that was there?

827
00:42:31,678 --> 00:42:33,378
I'm sorry for what I did then,

828
00:42:33,378 --> 00:42:36,678
I was threatened, and had no choice.

829
00:42:40,778 --> 00:42:42,778
Are you all right?

830
00:42:50,478 --> 00:42:53,978
I'm sorry, Motoe doesn't seem to be feeling well,

831
00:42:53,978 --> 00:42:55,878
so could we leave?

832
00:42:55,878 --> 00:42:57,878
Huh? Yes.

833
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:02,078
Morning sickness is a symptom that seen

834
00:43:02,078 --> 00:43:03,678
during the early stages of pregnancy, right?

835
00:43:03,678 --> 00:43:06,378
Yeah. But the size of her stomach

836
00:43:06,378 --> 00:43:09,278
looked big enough to be six months pregnant.

837
00:43:09,278 --> 00:43:13,778
Well, she could be feeling nausea for some other reason too.

838
00:43:13,778 --> 00:43:15,878
Yes, that's right, Camel.

839
00:43:15,878 --> 00:43:19,278
That man with the burn, wasn't Shu, I guess.

840
00:43:19,278 --> 00:43:22,378
He seemed to have been just a decoy sent out

841
00:43:22,378 --> 00:43:23,578
by the Organization

842
00:43:23,578 --> 00:43:25,678
to confirm whether Shu really died or not.

843
00:43:25,678 --> 00:43:27,978
Oh, Jodie.

844
00:43:27,978 --> 00:43:32,378
Anyway, I'll give you the details after I get back there, okay?

845
00:43:32,378 --> 00:43:34,678
I think the cash has been taken,

846
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:36,978
but please confirm the contents of the wallet.

847
00:43:36,978 --> 00:43:38,478
Yes.

848
00:43:40,378 --> 00:43:42,678
All my cards are intact

849
00:43:42,678 --> 00:43:44,778
and the contents of my pocket.

850
00:43:46,278 --> 00:43:49,878
This is... back during the department hijacking.

851
00:43:54,378 --> 00:43:57,578
Huh? The edge of the coaster is bent.

852
00:44:00,678 --> 00:44:03,678
Run for it! This area is dangerous.

853
00:44:05,878 --> 00:44:07,178
Shu!

854
00:44:08,878 --> 00:44:10,278
Shu!

855
00:44:11,278 --> 00:44:12,778
Shu.

856
00:44:14,578 --> 00:44:18,578
If that man with the burn isn't Shu...

857
00:44:18,578 --> 00:44:22,478
Who on earth's doing this? For what?

858
00:44:24,378 --> 00:44:27,578
I'm sorry, Agent Jodie.

859
00:45:54,678 --> 00:45:56,778
Hey, you.

860
00:45:56,778 --> 00:45:59,878
You'll catch cold sleeping in a place like...

861
00:45:59,878 --> 00:46:02,278
Huh?

862
00:46:02,278 --> 00:46:04,178
Hey, you?

863
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:07,778
Don't worry! He's just drunk and sleeping.

864
00:46:07,778 --> 00:46:08,778
Huh?

865
00:46:08,778 --> 00:46:10,878
My big brother's not a strong drinker.

866
00:46:10,878 --> 00:46:11,978
Huh?

867
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:14,678
Twins?

868
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:22,178
What an incident that was?

869
00:46:22,178 --> 00:46:23,878
To think that the man you disguised yourself as

870
00:46:23,878 --> 00:46:26,178
was pickpocketed.

871
00:46:26,178 --> 00:46:28,378
I did think something was strange

872
00:46:28,378 --> 00:46:30,978
because he didn't have a wallet, though.

873
00:46:30,978 --> 00:46:35,078
Well, it was good for me that I took the queer 5 yen coins

874
00:46:35,078 --> 00:46:37,678
that the man had on him.

875
00:46:37,678 --> 00:46:40,378
But, to go out of the way to return the wallet

876
00:46:40,378 --> 00:46:42,878
that was pickpocketed back to him.

877
00:46:42,878 --> 00:46:45,778
I didn't want him to make a big fuss later!

878
00:46:45,778 --> 00:46:46,778
Because there was a cash card

879
00:46:46,778 --> 00:46:48,878
and driver's license inside too, you know.

880
00:46:48,878 --> 00:46:51,778
Well, you'd better be grateful.

881
00:46:51,778 --> 00:46:56,178
When that kitty cat of the FBI grabbed your arm,

882
00:46:56,178 --> 00:46:59,778
the wiretap that you put into the fold of her sleeve,

883
00:46:59,778 --> 00:47:02,378
I made sure I retrieved it for you.

884
00:47:02,378 --> 00:47:04,278
Thank you.

885
00:47:04,278 --> 00:47:07,678
And?

886
00:47:07,678 --> 00:47:11,378
From that kitty cat,

887
00:47:11,378 --> 00:47:13,778
did you get to listen to any good stories?

888
00:47:13,778 --> 00:47:18,078
Yes. I got a lot of what I wanted.

889
00:47:18,078 --> 00:47:19,278
I got to hear unexpected stories

890
00:47:19,278 --> 00:47:20,678
that went on behind the scenes too besides.

891
00:47:20,678 --> 00:47:25,478
I hope I get to hear the rest of that story from you.

892
00:47:25,478 --> 00:47:28,878
Yes, as soon as I get solid proof, I will.

893
00:47:28,878 --> 00:47:31,878
But, let me just tell you this.

894
00:47:33,578 --> 00:47:36,178
He's a dreadfully intelligent man.

895
00:47:39,278 --> 00:47:41,478
That young man.

896
00:47:43,678 --> 00:47:48,378
So, you're not convinced of Kogoro's deduction after all?

897
00:47:48,378 --> 00:47:49,978
