1
00:00:02,814 --> 00:00:05,714
The timekeeper sends a threat letter.

2
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:08,414
The contents warn that Mrs. Rukako Hoshina,

3
00:00:08,414 --> 00:00:10,014
owner of the Building of Clocks,

4
00:00:10,014 --> 00:00:14,014
will be killed during her birthday.

5
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:17,614
We were invited to the party

6
00:00:17,614 --> 00:00:19,999
along with Pops who was asked to protect her.

7
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,014
But at the ring of the 6:00 chime,

8
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:26,714
she ended up being killed by someone.

9
00:00:29,114 --> 00:00:31,614
The culprit seems to have stabbed Rukako's chest

10
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:34,013
with a sharp object like an ice pick

11
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:36,614
and fled from the balcony.

12
00:00:36,614 --> 00:00:39,714
However, the weird thing was that no footprints

13
00:00:39,714 --> 00:00:43,814
were left on the ground that was wet with rain.

14
00:00:43,814 --> 00:00:46,514
A life was also lost at her birthday party

15
00:00:46,514 --> 00:00:49,314
that was held at the Hoshina residence four years ago.

16
00:00:49,314 --> 00:00:52,414
A clock technician who was repairing the grand clock fell,

17
00:00:52,414 --> 00:00:55,514
but the search for his body was delayed because of her party.

18
00:00:56,814 --> 00:00:58,037
Ran is terrified

19
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:01,714
that the Timekeeper is the ghost of the clock technician that died,

20
00:01:01,714 --> 00:01:03,614
but she's wrong.

21
00:01:03,614 --> 00:01:07,014
I'll reveal the true identity of the culprit at all cost!

22
00:01:10,514 --> 00:01:12,314
Like the fog clears.

23
00:01:12,314 --> 00:01:14,053
Let's see through love and crime as well!

24
00:01:14,214 --> 00:01:16,055
A blackmail warning that time will be stopped is delivered.

25
00:01:16,214 --> 00:01:18,314
Fear sweeps through the birthday party.

26
00:01:18,314 --> 00:01:20,059
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:21,714
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:24,063
His name is Detective Conan!

29
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:09,103
"The Blade of the Timekeeper (Part 2)".

30
00:03:12,603 --> 00:03:14,803
So you're an architect.

31
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:16,175
I'm Karube,

32
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:18,177
the one who designed this building.

33
00:03:18,403 --> 00:03:22,803
Your hands and sleeves have blood on them.

34
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:24,183
It probably got there

35
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:27,303
when I ran over to Mrs. Hoshina who fell to the floor.

36
00:03:27,303 --> 00:03:31,003
But there's no blood anywhere else is there?

37
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:32,203
No.

38
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:34,203
And? Is there anything

39
00:03:34,203 --> 00:03:36,603
that you noticed at the time of the crime?

40
00:03:36,603 --> 00:03:38,203
Come to think of it,

41
00:03:38,203 --> 00:03:39,603
"Karube Teigo (45)" -I think I heard something like cloth

42
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:42,203
"Architect" -being rubbed against something approaching,

43
00:03:42,203 --> 00:03:45,603
so the culprit could be a woman who is wearing a dress.

44
00:03:45,603 --> 00:03:49,803
By the way, the mouthpiece of your pipe

45
00:03:49,803 --> 00:03:52,203
also looks long and sharp.

46
00:03:52,203 --> 00:03:54,803
Is it all right if I check it?

47
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:59,403
Hey! Enough already!

48
00:03:59,403 --> 00:04:01,403
It's true that the clock technician who died four years ago

49
00:04:01,403 --> 00:04:02,703
was my older brother,

50
00:04:02,703 --> 00:04:05,703
so I have the most motive to be the killer

51
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,227
but that was an unfortunate accident!

52
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:11,003
I had no grudge against Mrs. Hoshina.

53
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:15,603
But you were given charge of decorating the interior of this building.

54
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:18,903
Therefore, you could've rigged this place any way you wanted to.

55
00:04:18,903 --> 00:04:22,241
"Suou Chiaki (39)" -As to that, Mr. Karube the architect,

56
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:24,243
"Interior Designer" -as well as Mr. Furugaki who made the grand clock

57
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:25,603
would also be in the same boat.

58
00:04:25,603 --> 00:04:30,003
But I guess Mr. Furugaki who is quite aged shouldn't be included.

59
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,603
Why not?

60
00:04:31,603 --> 00:04:34,253
The culprit after stabbing Mrs. Hoshina,

61
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:38,257
went pass my left side quite swiftly!

62
00:04:38,503 --> 00:04:43,503
So, see, there is a smear of blood on my left arm, isn't there?

63
00:04:43,503 --> 00:04:46,703
By the way, the thing that you're wearing in your hair...

64
00:04:48,803 --> 00:04:51,403
This is a hairpin that my older brother bought for me some time ago.

65
00:04:51,403 --> 00:04:54,003
May I check it, please?

66
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:56,275
You can check it all you want!

67
00:04:59,803 --> 00:05:01,803
I mean it's not a samurai movie or anything,

68
00:05:01,803 --> 00:05:04,803
so I couldn't possibly have a sword or the like on me.

69
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:07,103
I guess not.

70
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:08,803
It was you, wasn't it?

71
00:05:08,803 --> 00:05:12,291
The clock technician that made that grand clock.

72
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,293
Yeah, I'm Furugaki.

73
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:16,003
Your right shoulder

74
00:05:16,003 --> 00:05:18,297
seems to have a bit of splattered blood on it.

75
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:19,603
"Furugaki Rinsaku (64), Clock Technician"

76
00:05:19,603 --> 00:05:24,303
It seems that woman was stabbed to my right, so...

77
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:26,003
I could care less,

78
00:05:26,003 --> 00:05:29,103
but I think the culprit is someone who is quite fat.

79
00:05:30,103 --> 00:05:32,803
Just before that woman screamed,

80
00:05:32,803 --> 00:05:37,203
I was pushed by a soft resilient body.

81
00:05:38,703 --> 00:05:41,603
It... it's true that I'm 78 kilograms,

82
00:05:41,603 --> 00:05:43,403
and a little plump,

83
00:05:43,403 --> 00:05:47,603
but does that have anything to do with the incident?

84
00:05:47,603 --> 00:05:50,329
No, this is just in case.

85
00:05:51,503 --> 00:05:53,303
By the way, Mr. Oume,

86
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:56,803
about this knife beside the cake...

87
00:05:56,803 --> 00:05:59,603
Your fingerprints have been detected on it.

88
00:05:59,603 --> 00:06:01,603
"Oume Gakumichi (42)" -Of course!

89
00:06:01,603 --> 00:06:03,103
"Hoshina Family Butler" -As a steward,

90
00:06:03,103 --> 00:06:06,345
my job is to cut the cake, you see.

91
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:08,347
After the candle lights went out,

92
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:10,103
the lights weren't turned on immediately,

93
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,703
why?

94
00:06:11,703 --> 00:06:15,103
That's because Mrs. Hoshina didn't signal for the lights to be turned on.

95
00:06:15,103 --> 00:06:17,403
If as usual, after she blows out the candles,

96
00:06:17,403 --> 00:06:19,903
the 6:00 bell would ring.

97
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,403
After it rings,

98
00:06:21,403 --> 00:06:24,103
Mrs. Hoshina snaps her fingers to signal the lights to be turned on,

99
00:06:24,103 --> 00:06:25,803
and that's when they're turned on.

100
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:27,503
But back then,

101
00:06:27,503 --> 00:06:30,803
the clock didn't ring right away either, did it?

102
00:06:30,803 --> 00:06:32,103
No.

103
00:06:32,103 --> 00:06:34,103
Although the three who were glued to the clocks

104
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:35,903
that were about to be delayed,

105
00:06:35,903 --> 00:06:39,503
all said that the clocks rang on time.

106
00:06:39,503 --> 00:06:41,003
More than that,

107
00:06:41,003 --> 00:06:43,203
you seem to have been close to Mrs. Hoshina

108
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:46,403
and yet, no blood is splattered on you.

109
00:06:46,403 --> 00:06:49,303
Maybe it's because the culprit was a big person?

110
00:06:49,303 --> 00:06:53,303
That's why no blood is splattered on me.

111
00:06:55,903 --> 00:07:01,203
A person wearing a dress who can move swiftly, but is hefty and big...

112
00:07:01,203 --> 00:07:04,403
Was there such a person among the guests?

113
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:05,603
No.

114
00:07:05,603 --> 00:07:07,703
65 guests came to the party.

115
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:10,703
We checked them all, but there was no such person.

116
00:07:10,703 --> 00:07:12,703
Besides, there were no guests that had anything

117
00:07:12,703 --> 00:07:14,803
that looked to be a weapon on them either.

118
00:07:14,803 --> 00:07:16,003
Yes.

119
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:18,003
Well, it seems that no luminol reaction was found

120
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:20,903
from the belongings of the four.

121
00:07:20,903 --> 00:07:23,603
In other words, just as the threat letter put it,

122
00:07:23,603 --> 00:07:27,503
it was an "invisible blade" that committed the murder.

123
00:07:27,503 --> 00:07:29,403
I guess so.

124
00:07:33,303 --> 00:07:35,703
The blood that was on the railing and the window frame

125
00:07:35,703 --> 00:07:37,403
was Mrs. Hoshina's, right?

126
00:07:37,403 --> 00:07:38,437
Yeah.

127
00:07:38,603 --> 00:07:41,503
I don't know how the culprit got Mrs. Hoshina's blood on the railing

128
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:42,903
before committing the crime,

129
00:07:42,903 --> 00:07:45,703
but if he wanted to make it look like he fled from the window,

130
00:07:45,703 --> 00:07:49,103
there's no mistake that the blood was smeared on beforehand.

131
00:07:49,103 --> 00:07:50,803
But isn't it strange?

132
00:07:51,803 --> 00:07:54,453
If the culprit's going to make it look like he fled from here,

133
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:59,103
it would look more real if he put an obvious bloody shoe print behind

134
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,903
than this smeared trace of blood.

135
00:08:01,903 --> 00:08:03,503
True.

136
00:08:03,503 --> 00:08:05,303
Maybe he thought if something more obvious was left behind,

137
00:08:05,303 --> 00:08:08,467
it would be disclosed before the crime was committed?

138
00:08:09,703 --> 00:08:12,471
Hey, hey! It's already 12:00 midnight?

139
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:16,103
I see. That room's right below the grand clock.

140
00:08:21,303 --> 00:08:22,481
No, wrong!

141
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:26,103
The blood wasn't put there beforehand!

142
00:08:26,103 --> 00:08:28,903
The Timekeeper really passed through here at the time of the crime.

143
00:08:28,903 --> 00:08:32,503
Just as his planned!

144
00:08:35,503 --> 00:08:37,603
As a result of checking you all,

145
00:08:37,603 --> 00:08:40,803
there was no one with a hidden weapon on them

146
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:45,303
nor was there anyone with a large amount of blood on.

147
00:08:45,303 --> 00:08:47,703
So, you may leave for today,

148
00:08:47,703 --> 00:08:51,103
and tomorrow we will be performing a detailed interrogation.

149
00:08:53,703 --> 00:08:54,513
And,

150
00:08:54,703 --> 00:08:57,103
you have nothing to say about this, do you, Mr. Mouri?

151
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,517
No.

152
00:08:58,703 --> 00:09:01,503
It seems that more than the mystery of the murder weapon disappearing,

153
00:09:01,503 --> 00:09:04,803
it would be better to consider and figure out

154
00:09:04,803 --> 00:09:07,003
the trick of how the culprit got away from the balcony

155
00:09:07,003 --> 00:09:08,903
without leaving any footprints behind.

156
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:12,531
Dad?

157
00:09:13,703 --> 00:09:16,535
I'm spinning around and around.

158
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:18,303
I spin around!

159
00:09:18,303 --> 00:09:20,539
-Watch out! -Oh, no!

160
00:09:23,503 --> 00:09:26,003
Just what do you think you're doing?

161
00:09:26,003 --> 00:09:27,803
You'll fall!

162
00:09:28,803 --> 00:09:30,103
Right.

163
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:33,203
I was almost about to fall

164
00:09:33,203 --> 00:09:36,103
for the scheme that the culprit set up

165
00:09:36,103 --> 00:09:38,303
while snickering inside this room!

166
00:09:39,603 --> 00:09:42,561
So, the culprit is in this room after all?

167
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:45,003
Mr. Mouri.

168
00:09:45,003 --> 00:09:46,103
It bothers me

169
00:09:46,103 --> 00:09:49,803
that the culprit's footprints aren't found below the balcony,

170
00:09:49,803 --> 00:09:54,303
but it's unthinkable that the culprit is in here.

171
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:55,803
All right then,

172
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:59,303
I shall show you by means of evidence now!

173
00:09:59,303 --> 00:10:01,703
-Prove by evidence? -Yes.

174
00:10:01,703 --> 00:10:04,103
It'll take some time to make preparations, though.

175
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,603
So, will you Inspector, and the guests go outside the room?

176
00:10:14,103 --> 00:10:16,903
I wonder how long they expect to make us wait.

177
00:10:16,903 --> 00:10:19,503
It seems that a young officer and the steward

178
00:10:19,503 --> 00:10:21,903
are going in and out of the room from a while ago.

179
00:10:21,903 --> 00:10:24,203
I wonder if he's really going to be able to prove it.

180
00:10:24,203 --> 00:10:26,303
To kill a person without getting blood on himself

181
00:10:26,303 --> 00:10:29,003
and get rid of the murder weapon at the same time?

182
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:33,103
How dare he locks me out of the room too?

183
00:10:33,103 --> 00:10:35,903
He better have a darn good deduction or he's going to get it.

184
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,803
Thank you for waiting!

185
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,403
The room's ready.

186
00:10:39,403 --> 00:10:42,203
Please enter the room, everyone!

187
00:10:43,803 --> 00:10:45,603
Inspector!

188
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,903
Please hang this around your neck, Inspector.

189
00:10:50,003 --> 00:10:54,303
Is this the wristwatch light that Conan always has on him?

190
00:10:54,303 --> 00:10:55,603
Yes.

191
00:10:55,603 --> 00:10:57,403
We're going to have you play the role

192
00:10:57,403 --> 00:10:59,603
of the victim who was killed, Inspector.

193
00:10:59,603 --> 00:11:01,003
That's to be used in place of the necklace

194
00:11:01,003 --> 00:11:03,103
that had fluorescent paint on it.

195
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:11,603
Nothing seems to be all that different.

196
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:12,651
True.

197
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:14,403
The only thing difference if anything is that

198
00:11:14,403 --> 00:11:15,903
the boy with the glasses

199
00:11:15,903 --> 00:11:19,903
is standing in front of the window that is closed.

200
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:24,663
I have no idea what you're planning to do,

201
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:26,665
but please hurry it up, will you?

202
00:11:28,003 --> 00:11:29,203
Hey, what?

203
00:11:29,203 --> 00:11:32,671
We're replaying the scene of the crime.

204
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:34,673
First, the lights of the room go out.

205
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:36,675
And the cake was brought in, correct?

206
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:38,303
Yes, sir.

207
00:11:38,303 --> 00:11:40,679
Okay, Inspector, when I signal you,

208
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:43,403
please blow out the candles just as the victim did.

209
00:11:45,503 --> 00:11:48,303
3, 2, 1.

210
00:11:48,303 --> 00:11:49,703
Okay!

211
00:11:53,703 --> 00:11:56,695
Who is it that just hit my head with a stick?

212
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:04,703
Hey, hey, what's with this experiment?

213
00:12:04,903 --> 00:12:08,707
It's no use making believe to open the window and flee outside!

214
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:11,503
I saw the stick that hit me!

215
00:12:11,503 --> 00:12:14,203
So, the one who's still holding the stick

216
00:12:14,203 --> 00:12:17,003
-is surely the one who hit me! -I'm sorry.

217
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:20,719
I'm the one who hit you just now, Inspector.

218
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:23,303
Don't be ridiculous, Conan!

219
00:12:23,303 --> 00:12:26,103
You don't even have a stick on you in the first place.

220
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:28,403
Of course I don't have one.

221
00:12:28,403 --> 00:12:30,103
Because the stick I hit you with

222
00:12:30,103 --> 00:12:32,303
flew out the window and disappeared.

223
00:12:32,303 --> 00:12:33,403
What?

224
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,240
Is it true,

225
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,440
that the stick came flying?

226
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,540
Yes, sir!

227
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,140
But the thing that came flying wasn't a stick.

228
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,440
It was an umbrella that was pulled by a string.

229
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,440
An umbrella?

230
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,340
Hey, is it true?

231
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,040
Yes, sir! It's this umbrella!

232
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,440
Well, it took a while to get everything ready.

233
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,040
I had to have the steward get a long string ready

234
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,767
and ask a clock technician

235
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:14,773
to advance the hands of the grand clock to 6:00 the time of the crime.

236
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:17,140
The clock?

237
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,777
Just what do you mean?

238
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:21,140
Here's the trick.

239
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,140
First, you get a long string

240
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,440
and tie a weight part way of it,

241
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,840
and hook on a ring that slides easily to one tip of the string.

242
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,140
Then you hook the ring onto the decoration

243
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,791
at the tip of the short hand of the grand clock

244
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,840
by pulling the string through.

245
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,340
As for the side with the weight on it,

246
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:41,440
you hang it over the railing of the balcony.

247
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,840
And the tip on the other side of the string

248
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,140
is pulled into the room from the space between the window.

249
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,440
The culprit waits for the room lights to go out and it gets dark

250
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,840
so the candles on the cake can be blown out.

251
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,811
After the string that is pulled into the room

252
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,440
is tied to the handle of the umbrella,

253
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,840
all is ready.

254
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,140
All that's left to do is for Conan to hit the Inspector on the head

255
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,640
a few seconds before it becomes 6:00.

256
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,823
A few seconds afterwards,

257
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,740
the short hand of the grand clock will face straight down,

258
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,827
and the ring with the string on it will come out

259
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:11,340
from the space of the decoration, and the ring will slide off.

260
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,740
The weight that was hanging falls

261
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,540
and the umbrella that is pulled pushes the window open

262
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,240
and falls below the balcony.

263
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,740
That's how it disappeared from the room.

264
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,540
Mr. Mouri,

265
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,845
there was no murder weapon or weight on the ground, you know.

266
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,440
Besides, if such a string were to be hanging,

267
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,440
wouldn't somebody has noticed it?

268
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,240
What if the string were to be a thin fishing line that is barely visible,

269
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,440
and the weight that was tied part way of the string

270
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:44,863
is inside the grid of the well that is right below the grand clock?

271
00:14:44,863 --> 00:14:45,940
I see!

272
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,740
The murder weapon that was pulled by the weight

273
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,540
is sucked in as is into the well!

274
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,840
Yeah,

275
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,873
and since that well is scheduled to be gotten rid of week after next

276
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,877
that the culprit figured the murder weapon would be buried forever.

277
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:03,240
Why wasn't blood splattered on the culprit, then?

278
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,540
Come to think of it,

279
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,040
there were a lot of testimony about the image of the culprit, no?

280
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,940
The culprit is big, fat,

281
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,240
and moves swiftly, a woman wearing a dress.

282
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,440
The fact is,

283
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,895
all this was pointing to the murder weapon!

284
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:18,897
The murder weapon?

285
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:20,899
You thought the culprit moved swiftly

286
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:26,240
because the murder weapon with blood on it blew out of the window.

287
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,840
The umbrella was thought to be huge when it's opened,

288
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,340
it covers quite a large area.

289
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,240
And the testimony about the culprit being fat

290
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,440
was because when the murder weapon was pushed against the body,

291
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,940
it feels bouncy.

292
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,921
Since the murder weapon was covered with cloth,

293
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:46,440
the sound of the cloth of the dress rubbing against each other was heard.

294
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,440
What on earth is that murder weapon anyway?

295
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,040
This, the same one that I hit you with, Inspector!

296
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,935
Umbrella?

297
00:15:56,935 --> 00:16:00,040
See, if you attach a sharp murder weapon

298
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,941
on the tip with a screw or something,

299
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,140
even if the culprit stabbed Mrs. Hoshina with this and pulled it out,

300
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,740
no blood would splatter, right?

301
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,540
Right, Pops?

302
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,040
But, the party was being held.

303
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,340
Bringing an umbrella in would be conspicuous, wouldn't it?

304
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,940
No, not if it was secretly hidden in his pocket or something.

305
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,240
Mr. Karube,

306
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,340
like the folding umbrella you have!

307
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,971
But Mr. Mouri,

308
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:36,975
although it's true that you can avoid blood being splattered...

309
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:41,340
After that, wouldn't it take time to fold the umbrella?

310
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,981
True.

311
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,640
When Mrs. Hoshina screamed,

312
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,640
it wasn't a long time before the bell of the grand clock

313
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,640
was heard, was it?

314
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,340
The umbrella can be folded in an instant.

315
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,540
If he didn't care about the blood that would get on his hands,

316
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,640
and narrowed the umbrella

317
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,040
and use the rubber band or whatever he had on his wrist to hold it down.

318
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,940
I see.

319
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,840
That's why Mr. Karube had quite a lot of blood on both his hands!

320
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,005
Yes.

321
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,007
If you, the one who was the last one

322
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:11,009
to close the door of the face of the clock,

323
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,440
you could've hooked the string onto the short hand of the clock.

324
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,840
After that, you said you were going to pray before the well,

325
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,017
so you could've pulled the string

326
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:20,640
that was hanging to the ground over to the well

327
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,740
and attach the weight, while pretending to pray.

328
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,340
Since you're the one who designed the building,

329
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:31,940
it would've been easy for you to tell how long the string should be.

330
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:36,640
You were touching Mrs. Hoshina's flashlight wristwatch before the crime,

331
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,440
so you could've moved the clock a few seconds fast

332
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,640
and after Mrs. Hoshina blew out the candle,

333
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,440
you could've used the few seconds before the grand clock rang

334
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,540
to commit the murder!

335
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,540
But Mr. Karube was the one

336
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,740
who said that he heard the sound of cloth being rubbed, right?

337
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,040
If he were the culprit, I wonder if he'd say anything

338
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,940
that would make people imagine an umbrella?

339
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,540
He deliberately said it.

340
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,040
He deliberately mixed some truth in his testimony to mislead us.

341
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,540
That is, that the culprit could be a woman who was wearing a dress.

342
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,740
If he lied about everything,

343
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,840
he would be the only one saying something different from all the others

344
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,440
and would be suspected.

345
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,540
But...

346
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:17,075
But when all the others didn't want to cooperate

347
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,640
and wanted to leave, Mr. Karube stopped them, didn't he?

348
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,440
He said let's cooperate with the police

349
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,340
for the sake of the late Mrs. Hoshina!

350
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,640
I think he would've gone home then, if he were the culprit.

351
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,140
True.

352
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,640
He couldn't leave even if he wanted to.

353
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,093
Because it suddenly began to rain again.

354
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:37,095
The umbrella that he brought when he came here

355
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:38,340
was used as the murder weapon,

356
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,240
and is in the well right now.

357
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,340
If he left at that time,

358
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,840
we would find out that the umbrella he was supposed to have is gone.

359
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,740
Too bad,

360
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,540
if you had assumed it may turn out this way

361
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,540
and prepared another umbrella...

362
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:57,540
No, I actually had another umbrella ready in my bag.

363
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:04,840
It seems that my wife took that extra umbrella out of my bag.

364
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,640
There was a memo written, "One umbrella will do, won't it?"

365
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,440
Well, it was the rain that I had been waiting for some time too,

366
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,540
so I failed to double check because I was so pressed

367
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,135
to carry out what I wanted to do.

368
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:19,137
That's where I went wrong too.

369
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:21,139
You were waiting for some time?

370
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:24,140
Does that mean that you've been planning this murder since two years ago

371
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,740
when the threat letter was first delivered here?

372
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,740
Yes. If it rains,

373
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,140
I could deceive everyone about the footprints of the culprit

374
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,640
not being there,

375
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,940
and none of the guests would go out on the balcony

376
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,240
where there is no roof either.

377
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,157
So, I didn't have to worry about my trick being disclosed.

378
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,640
Well, I was a little flustered when it stopped raining

379
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,163
before I committed the crime.

380
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:48,240
You're admitting that you committed the crime, then?

381
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,540
Yes.

382
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,640
Mrs. Hoshina's blood and my fingerprints

383
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,175
are probably all over the umbrella that I dropped into the well.

384
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:58,540
But, why?

385
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,179
Why did you kill her?

386
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,640
Doesn't my wanting to avenge

387
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,840
the death of my childhood friend clock technician suffice?

388
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,193
But, wasn't you who said at my big brother's funeral

389
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:17,540
that it was an unfortunate accident?

390
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:22,040
That is, until that funeral day,

391
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,340
when I heard her voice.

392
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,840
Hey, just what do you mean?

393
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,040
Why hasn't a clock technician to take his place been found yet?

394
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,240
I'm sorry.

395
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,840
Thinking of the clock technician who passed away,

396
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,240
I just couldn't get myself to look for someone else yet.

397
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,540
I've said time again, haven't I?

398
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,240
That a broke clock needs to be disposed of

399
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,840
and a new one needs to be bought to replace it!

400
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,540
The same goes for clock technicians!

401
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,840
Oh, my...

402
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,040
He loved clocks more than anyone else.

403
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,140
So, you're a clock technician here?

404
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,640
Yeah!

405
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,240
Are you going to do okay, though?

406
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,140
I hear the lady here is really strict when it comes to time.

407
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,240
Sure, I'll be just fine!

408
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,440
Being around someone strict like her makes my work even more worth it.

409
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,140
Besides, not one clock had been disposed of since I came!

410
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,340
After all, my heart and soul

411
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,540
are in all the clocks here and are like family!

412
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,840
I'm really all for this job!

413
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:24,440
Brother...

414
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:34,740
Maybe rather than wanting to avenge his death,

415
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,240
what I really wanted to do was save them

416
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,440
from the ruler of time.

417
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,740
His so-called family.

418
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,840
Clocks...

419
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,740
They are indispensible partners for people

420
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,369
who need them to live every day.

421
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:13,640
Though they may sometimes be late.

422
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,640
Genta, you're late!

423
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,740
Sorry!

424
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,440
My alarm clock wasn't working right.

425
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,040
Don't tell me you're still using that old clock.

426
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,040
Yeah!

427
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,440
My late grandma gave it to me,

428
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,840
so if I dispose of it, I'll be cursed.

429
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,940
If that clock is precious,

430
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,840
I guess we'll overlook you being late.

431
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,397
After all, clocks keep ticking away and working

432
00:23:39,397 --> 00:23:43,040
even while we're sleeping.

433
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,040
Geez, Conan sure is late.

434
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,140
We've got to get going soon,

435
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,740
or it'll be night by the time we get to the camping site.

436
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,840
Maybe he's still asleep.

437
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:01,140
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock...

438
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,250
Next Conan's Hint:

439
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,792
"Glass".

440
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:07,980
Our next story has a Shouwa vibe?

441
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,116
There's no screentime for you!

442
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:10,940
This Great Detective will be on a roll!
