1
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:03,983
Triggered by the crime that occurred in Osaka,

2
00:00:04,162 --> 00:00:06,262
Heiji Hattori, Kazuha Toyama

3
00:00:06,262 --> 00:00:09,362
and Inspector Otaki of the Osaka Police Department

4
00:00:09,362 --> 00:00:12,962
came to Tokyo to launch investigations.

5
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:15,262
The crime site that we, all six of us

6
00:00:15,262 --> 00:00:17,997
including Pops, Ran and I headed for

7
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:20,562
was a condo in Tokyo.

8
00:00:21,562 --> 00:00:24,003
However, the incident turned out to be a suicide case,

9
00:00:24,162 --> 00:00:26,462
and was solved just like that.

10
00:00:27,562 --> 00:00:28,562
While we were ready to leave the site

11
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:31,062
and waiting for the elevator...

12
00:00:32,262 --> 00:00:33,562
Talk of the devil.

13
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,862
-Wh... -What?

14
00:00:40,662 --> 00:00:43,362
Although it looked be suicide at first glance,

15
00:00:43,362 --> 00:00:45,562
due to the many unsettling points that emerged,

16
00:00:45,562 --> 00:00:48,362
we decided to investigate it as homicide.

17
00:00:48,362 --> 00:00:50,029
And through the questioning carried out

18
00:00:50,262 --> 00:00:51,562
by Officer Takagi and the others,

19
00:00:51,562 --> 00:00:54,033
the suspects were narrowed down to three people.

20
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:58,462
By the way, what do you do for a living?

21
00:00:58,462 --> 00:01:01,362
I'm employed at a building maintenance company.

22
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:03,662
I handle intercoms and locker deliveries.

23
00:01:03,662 --> 00:01:05,262
I also handle air conditioners.

24
00:01:05,262 --> 00:01:07,462
Which means you also handle

25
00:01:07,462 --> 00:01:10,049
elevator and security maintenance?

26
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,362
By the way, you.

27
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:14,662
What's your relationship with Mr. Fuura, the deceased?

28
00:01:14,662 --> 00:01:18,762
Your name was in Mr. Fuura's cell phone, you see.

29
00:01:18,762 --> 00:01:21,262
Oh, well, I talked to him a bit about stocks.

30
00:01:21,262 --> 00:01:24,462
Which means that you lost out on stocks because of Mr. Fuura,

31
00:01:24,462 --> 00:01:27,062
and hated him too?

32
00:01:27,062 --> 00:01:29,462
It's true that I had a grudge against him,

33
00:01:29,462 --> 00:01:31,262
but I wouldn't kill him because of it.

34
00:01:31,262 --> 00:01:33,662
Oh. It's true that I lost out too,

35
00:01:33,662 --> 00:01:36,862
because of the stocks Mr. Fuura recommended me to buy.

36
00:01:36,862 --> 00:01:38,762
But, I don't have any grudge against him!

37
00:01:38,762 --> 00:01:39,762
Because it's my fault too

38
00:01:39,762 --> 00:01:40,762
for not being able to read the direction of

39
00:01:40,762 --> 00:01:43,562
where the stocks were headed for, you see.

40
00:01:46,662 --> 00:01:48,562
This room smells of thinner.

41
00:01:48,562 --> 00:01:49,862
That's because I was coloring

42
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:52,091
the freshly severed-like dolls' necks.

43
00:01:52,262 --> 00:01:54,093
Freshly severed necks?

44
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:57,762
That one over there looks exactly like my Dad.

45
00:01:57,762 --> 00:02:00,662
If so, I'm sure you can make it then, no?

46
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:01,762
A freshly made severed neck

47
00:02:01,762 --> 00:02:03,062
that looks exactly like Mr. Fuura?

48
00:02:03,062 --> 00:02:04,362
Well...

49
00:02:04,362 --> 00:02:07,762
Ms. Izutsu, what do you do for a living?

50
00:02:07,762 --> 00:02:10,862
Can't you tell by looking?

51
00:02:10,862 --> 00:02:14,113
A tracing table, tone, cutter knife.

52
00:02:14,113 --> 00:02:16,115
A G-pen, mapping pen, a brush,

53
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:18,117
calligraphy paint and ink.

54
00:02:18,117 --> 00:02:19,462
I'm a cartoonist!

55
00:02:19,462 --> 00:02:22,662
Haven't you ever heard of my pen name Kotori Misono?

56
00:02:22,662 --> 00:02:24,562
Oh, you're the author

57
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:25,662
of the beautiful detective girl cartoon

58
00:02:25,662 --> 00:02:27,762
that Chiba is hooked on.

59
00:02:27,762 --> 00:02:29,862
Which means it wouldn't be hard for you

60
00:02:29,862 --> 00:02:31,662
to come up with a story.

61
00:02:31,662 --> 00:02:34,133
To make it look as if someone committed suicide

62
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:35,462
in the elevator by using a gun,

63
00:02:35,462 --> 00:02:37,162
and kill him.

64
00:02:39,362 --> 00:02:41,262
If I came up with such an amusing story,

65
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:43,362
I would've drawn a comic about it already.

66
00:02:43,362 --> 00:02:46,145
The culprit is probably that person

67
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:47,462
who was hiding that thing.

68
00:02:47,462 --> 00:02:49,362
The question is the trick...

69
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:54,862
How did the culprit kill Mr. Fuura?

70
00:02:56,362 --> 00:02:58,162
Aim for a 100% solution.

71
00:02:58,162 --> 00:03:00,562
Clear all mysteries and codes.

72
00:03:00,562 --> 00:03:02,161
Murder in an elevator.

73
00:03:02,362 --> 00:03:04,462
Expose the shocking trick together with Hattori.

74
00:03:04,462 --> 00:03:06,165
He sees through the one and only truth.

75
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:08,167
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

76
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:10,562
His name is Detective Conan!

77
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:57,039
"Everyone was Watching (Part 2)"

78
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:00,639
I tell you that Heiji!

79
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,139
What's taking him so long?

80
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:04,283
Come now.

81
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:05,839
You're going to be spending the night

82
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,339
at our place already so...

83
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:08,639
But...

84
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,839
Oh, he's back.

85
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,291
And, how was it?

86
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,293
Did you figure out who the culprit was?

87
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:18,297
No. We did talk to the three suspects though.

88
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:21,239
They all seem suspicious and yet unsuspicious too.

89
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:25,039
All three of them seem to have a motive, though.

90
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,307
No, the culprit is probably that person.

91
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:30,339
The question is the trick that was used.

92
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:34,313
Oh, that's right. By the way, on the doors of the elevators,

93
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:36,315
all except for the ones on the 2nd and 3rd floors,

94
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:39,239
there seem to have been an "under inspection" sign!

95
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:42,739
I see. That's how people were kept away.

96
00:05:42,739 --> 00:05:45,039
Well, if it was suicide

97
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,639
you'd think that Mr. Fuura put it there

98
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,739
to avoid being interrupted.

99
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:49,939
Yes.

100
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:54,333
Hey! If you can't figure it out, why don't you call Kudo?

101
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,639
Huh?

102
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,337
Shinichi?

103
00:05:58,337 --> 00:06:00,339
Yep! Even during that incident

104
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:02,039
at the family restaurant the other time,

105
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,739
the case was solved in no time at all

106
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,839
after Conan merely placed a call to him, right?

107
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,839
Idiot. He hasn't figured anything out yet either.

108
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:13,739
Well, I guess that's one way to do it.

109
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:16,355
You two are full-fledged only when you work together too so...

110
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:19,839
Hey, hold it! Just who are you talking about?

111
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:22,139
The two of us?

112
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:23,939
Make us full-fledged?

113
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:24,939
Wait a sec.

114
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:26,639
If that is used...

115
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,739
I get it! That's why.

116
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:33,539
Yeah. That word 'Goodbye'...

117
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:37,339
That was not a message made to look like a mere will.

118
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:40,139
It was written there deliberately

119
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,039
because it needed to be written there!

120
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:45,139
In order to join the tricks together.

121
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:50,389
Huh? Really?

122
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:52,139
Is it true that no discharge residue

123
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:56,039
was detected from the three suspects?

124
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:58,397
Yes, definitely.

125
00:06:58,397 --> 00:07:01,239
I got a report from forensics a while ago.

126
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:02,939
I see.

127
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:04,403
I'm sorry I'm late.

128
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:06,405
I'm Megure from MPD.

129
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:09,539
Oh. I'm Otaki from the Osaka City Police Department.

130
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:11,939
I'm sorry for sticking my nose

131
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:16,039
into a case that occurred outside our jurisdiction.

132
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:18,039
No, don't be. Officer Takagi told me that

133
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:21,039
you helped out a lot with the questioning and all.

134
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,839
But, is it true that this is a homicide?

135
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:29,039
You saw Mr. Fuura shoot himself in the head with a gun

136
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,339
through the window of this elevator, didn't you?

137
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:34,433
Speak of the devil!

138
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:39,339
Yes.

139
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:42,441
If so, isn't it suicide?

140
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:45,439
I thought so too at first but...

141
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:47,839
The surveillance camera in the elevator

142
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,939
was blotted out with spray paint with the left hand.

143
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:55,139
The wristwatch that the corpse was wearing was stopped

144
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:56,139
and so forth,

145
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:58,139
there were many ambiguous points to consider.

146
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,839
It seemed quite strange to me too,

147
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,039
but you witnessed Mr. Fuura commit suicide.

148
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:08,467
Inspector.

149
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,939
Let me answer your question.

150
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:15,539
The culprit held the gun against Mr. Fuura's head

151
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:17,339
and remarked like so...

152
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:18,477
'If you don't want to get shot,

153
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:21,639
look out through the window of the elevator.'

154
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:24,483
And when the elevator passed through this floor,

155
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:26,039
the gun was fired.

156
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,839
That's why when we saw that,

157
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:33,439
we all thought it was suicide.

158
00:08:33,439 --> 00:08:35,139
I guess that's the truth.

159
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,739
That's impossible, no?

160
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:42,039
You'd all be aware no matter what

161
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,503
if the culprit's hand comes out from the side.

162
00:08:44,739 --> 00:08:47,639
The position of the culprit's hand that is holding the gun

163
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:49,339
and the position of Mr. Fuura's body that was shot

164
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:50,939
wouldn't match.

165
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:54,513
True. I wouldn't do it if I were the culprit.

166
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:56,515
Such a special effect would be so obvious.

167
00:08:56,515 --> 00:09:01,139
Besides, if so, Mr. Fuura would've put up more of a fight.

168
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:03,939
It's hard to think he would stay still enough

169
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:05,939
to make it look like a suicide.

170
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:08,539
Are these three people...

171
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:11,539
Yes. They are the three residents of this condo

172
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:13,139
who had no alibi.

173
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:15,639
But why are you here?

174
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,139
I didn't want to come but...

175
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:19,639
We were told to come here.

176
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,939
We were told that if we came here

177
00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:23,339
we'd find out the truth to the case,

178
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:24,939
by this boy here.

179
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:28,539
Yes, I brought the three here!

180
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:32,551
Because Officer Takagi and Heiji told me to do so!

181
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:33,739
Conan?

182
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:39,239
Hey, Conan. Where's Heiji?

183
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:41,739
I haven't seen him for about an hour.

184
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:45,139
He said he was going somewhere with Officer Takagi.

185
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:46,939
Something about he had something to do

186
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:49,139
at the store in back of this condo.

187
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:50,569
The store in the back?

188
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:52,139
What store in the back?

189
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:53,839
If I remember correctly...

190
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,339
I see! The back!

191
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:57,439
The culprit used this method of "Helping Hands".

192
00:09:57,439 --> 00:10:00,579
That is, the culprit hid behind Mr. Fuura and shot him!

193
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:01,539
It would look more natural

194
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:04,583
than to shoot him from the side, wouldn't it?

195
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:08,939
If so, when fired at, wouldn't Mr. Fuura's head move

196
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:11,939
exposing the face of the culprit behind him?

197
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:17,639
True.

198
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:19,539
Oh! It's Officer Takagi!

199
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:21,739
Bang!

200
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,039
Hey, what are you doing, Takagi?

201
00:10:35,673 --> 00:10:37,973
Oh, it's Officer Takagi!

202
00:10:38,773 --> 00:10:39,873
Bang!

203
00:10:43,973 --> 00:10:46,625
Hey, what are you doing?

204
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,973
But what we saw...

205
00:10:48,973 --> 00:10:50,973
It was just like that!

206
00:10:50,973 --> 00:10:53,673
So, two people were playing one person after all then!

207
00:10:53,673 --> 00:10:55,773
Takagi and the detective boy from Osaka

208
00:10:55,773 --> 00:10:58,040
tried acting it out!

209
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,639
To show us that if you do it right, it would look natural!

210
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,973
That Takagi...

211
00:11:03,573 --> 00:11:06,645
Hurry down here and explain, Takagi!

212
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:07,773
Yes, sir.

213
00:11:10,173 --> 00:11:11,573
Officer Takagi?

214
00:11:11,573 --> 00:11:13,073
Oh, well you see...

215
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,973
Takagi! Just what was that about?

216
00:11:16,973 --> 00:11:19,873
I just... I was just told to stay here

217
00:11:19,873 --> 00:11:24,273
and watch how everyone reacted by Hattori, you see.

218
00:11:24,273 --> 00:11:25,873
Watch?

219
00:11:25,873 --> 00:11:29,073
And, since when were you there?

220
00:11:29,073 --> 00:11:31,873
Just a little before the elevator came.

221
00:11:31,873 --> 00:11:33,273
No way!

222
00:11:33,273 --> 00:11:35,773
You were in the elevator a while ago, weren't you?

223
00:11:35,773 --> 00:11:37,973
That was...

224
00:11:38,973 --> 00:11:41,673
Officer Takagi's in the elevator again.

225
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:51,773
In other words, this is the truth of the trick!

226
00:11:51,773 --> 00:11:54,173
A tablet?

227
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:57,673
Yeah. I had Officer Takagi borrow it for me

228
00:11:57,673 --> 00:12:00,473
from the electric shop behind the condo!

229
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:04,273
The movie of the face of Officer Takagi

230
00:12:04,273 --> 00:12:06,973
that I read into this tablet a while ago.

231
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:08,973
I played it again on the tablet by pushing it

232
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:11,373
against the window of the elevator.

233
00:12:11,373 --> 00:12:12,373
Bang!

234
00:12:13,473 --> 00:12:15,073
Since the window of the elevator

235
00:12:15,073 --> 00:12:17,473
is partitioned with the word 'Goodbye',

236
00:12:17,473 --> 00:12:19,973
if the tablet is used, the trick won't be exposed.

237
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:23,673
In fact, even though it was all my body apart from the head,

238
00:12:23,673 --> 00:12:27,173
it really looked as if Officer Takagi was on the elevator, right?

239
00:12:27,173 --> 00:12:29,773
In other words, the tablet and my body

240
00:12:29,773 --> 00:12:32,731
both worked to make up just one of me!

241
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:38,737
But, Heiji. Isn't that a bit too far-fetched?

242
00:12:39,573 --> 00:12:42,741
All you did was pretend to fire, Heiji.

243
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:47,673
We saw him shoot himself in the head, you know?

244
00:12:47,673 --> 00:12:49,173
If it were as you say,

245
00:12:49,173 --> 00:12:51,173
he had to hold the tablet in his hand

246
00:12:51,173 --> 00:12:53,973
and fire right in front of his eyes

247
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,773
it would've been very dangerous.

248
00:12:56,773 --> 00:12:58,757
And, you can't even be sure

249
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:02,273
if that movement will match the tablet's either.

250
00:13:02,273 --> 00:13:04,763
Besides there should be another trace

251
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:09,173
of the remains of a bullet in the elevator too.

252
00:13:09,173 --> 00:13:10,373
Wrong, wrong!

253
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:14,173
I didn't have time just now so I used only one tablet!

254
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:17,273
I think the culprit used four tablets!

255
00:13:17,273 --> 00:13:19,873
Using four tablets, you can stream a movie

256
00:13:19,873 --> 00:13:21,573
with timing that matches perfectly!

257
00:13:21,573 --> 00:13:23,373
Four?

258
00:13:23,373 --> 00:13:25,073
Then, are you saying that what we saw

259
00:13:25,073 --> 00:13:27,373
were all movie images?

260
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,673
Right. All except for the face,

261
00:13:29,673 --> 00:13:31,873
it was a movie taken by the culprit who was wearing

262
00:13:31,873 --> 00:13:33,773
the same type of suit that Mr. Fuura was wearing.

263
00:13:33,773 --> 00:13:38,797
But can you hold four tablets with one hand?

264
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:40,573
I wonder.

265
00:13:40,573 --> 00:13:41,973
The culprit probably stuck four

266
00:13:41,973 --> 00:13:43,973
onto one large board or something.

267
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:47,373
If so, all that needed to be done was to place it against the door.

268
00:13:48,373 --> 00:13:50,473
Isn't that how it was done?

269
00:13:50,473 --> 00:13:54,073
You hid the fact that you had four tablets.

270
00:13:54,073 --> 00:13:56,473
Cartoonist, Ms. Naoko Izutsu.

271
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:06,173
You're the one, aren't you? The culprit?

272
00:14:06,173 --> 00:14:08,273
Hey, wait a minute there!

273
00:14:08,273 --> 00:14:09,373
As for the trick you just mentioned,

274
00:14:09,373 --> 00:14:12,573
anyone could've done it using four tablets.

275
00:14:12,573 --> 00:14:14,833
So, why do I end up being the one who did it?

276
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,773
It's because you're hiding the tablets!

277
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,473
The machine you had on the side of the tracing table

278
00:14:20,473 --> 00:14:22,273
on top of your work area.

279
00:14:22,273 --> 00:14:24,273
That's a mobile router, isn't it?

280
00:14:24,273 --> 00:14:26,845
I'm saying it's strange that you had no computer or tablet

281
00:14:27,073 --> 00:14:29,973
connected to the internet despite having the router!

282
00:14:29,973 --> 00:14:32,473
How should I know?

283
00:14:32,473 --> 00:14:36,073
Maybe the editor in charge forgot it there.

284
00:14:36,073 --> 00:14:37,573
I'm an analog person

285
00:14:37,573 --> 00:14:39,373
and don't use computers and such.

286
00:14:39,373 --> 00:14:43,373
Oh, cartoonists are super, aren't they?

287
00:14:43,373 --> 00:14:46,573
Because you're drawing detective cartoons, aren't you Miss?

288
00:14:46,573 --> 00:14:48,573
Despite that there were only

289
00:14:48,573 --> 00:14:50,473
a few comic books on your bookshelf!

290
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,473
To be able to draw and write all kinds of things

291
00:14:52,473 --> 00:14:53,873
without having to look at anything.

292
00:14:53,873 --> 00:14:56,173
I think that's really super!

293
00:14:58,173 --> 00:15:02,881
True, that unlike fairy tales and fantasy novels,

294
00:15:02,881 --> 00:15:04,673
detective comics would require

295
00:15:04,673 --> 00:15:06,273
a realistic description to some extent.

296
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:07,873
As for the background of the crime site

297
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:09,773
or the murder weapon and such.

298
00:15:09,773 --> 00:15:12,891
It's quite impossible to do all that without reference.

299
00:15:13,473 --> 00:15:14,893
If I remember correctly, I think Ms. Izutsu

300
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:18,473
mentioned having three assistants.

301
00:15:18,473 --> 00:15:21,273
So, three assistants and herself,

302
00:15:21,273 --> 00:15:23,673
would add up to four tablets, eh?

303
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:29,373
But, how did she make up the image of Mr. Fuura being shot?

304
00:15:29,373 --> 00:15:30,909
She couldn't possibly have told him

305
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:33,873
to act like he was being shot with a gun, could she?

306
00:15:33,873 --> 00:15:35,973
That's easy!

307
00:15:35,973 --> 00:15:38,373
When she was taking the movie like this,

308
00:15:38,373 --> 00:15:41,173
all she had to do was move the camera a bit.

309
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:44,273
See! You get an image like he was shot!

310
00:15:44,273 --> 00:15:47,473
Bullets aren't visible either way, besides!

311
00:15:48,373 --> 00:15:50,073
The problem is that the things in the background

312
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:52,573
also get blurred.

313
00:15:52,573 --> 00:15:56,935
But, it's hard to tell because there's nothing in the elevator.

314
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:58,373
True.

315
00:15:58,373 --> 00:16:00,473
Wow, Conan.

316
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:04,273
Well, Heiji told me all this, you see.

317
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:07,373
Right, Heiji?

318
00:16:07,373 --> 00:16:08,947
Yeah.

319
00:16:09,973 --> 00:16:13,473
I feel like I've become the Sleeping Kogoro, or something.

320
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,953
But...

321
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:16,073
If we weren't coincidentally

322
00:16:16,073 --> 00:16:17,573
in front of the elevator back then,

323
00:16:17,573 --> 00:16:18,957
this trick wouldn't work.

324
00:16:19,173 --> 00:16:20,573
It's not us! That she wanted to show what she did.

325
00:16:20,573 --> 00:16:22,961
She wanted to show it to Nanami who goes to

326
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:25,673
the esthetic salon every week at that hour.

327
00:16:25,673 --> 00:16:28,373
First, Ms. Izutsu, probably ask Mr. Fuura

328
00:16:28,373 --> 00:16:30,073
to come to a coffee shop nearby

329
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,971
so that she could introduce a new client to him,

330
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:34,973
after which she told him that she'd go ahead

331
00:16:35,173 --> 00:16:36,975
and wait for him by the elevator.

332
00:16:37,173 --> 00:16:39,773
She also instructed him to wear the same suit

333
00:16:39,773 --> 00:16:41,773
that was in the image.

334
00:16:41,773 --> 00:16:45,573
Then, Ms. Izutsu who got to the elevator before him,

335
00:16:45,573 --> 00:16:47,373
blotted out the surveillance camera in the elevator

336
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,273
with spray paint.

337
00:16:49,273 --> 00:16:50,473
She closed the door once

338
00:16:50,473 --> 00:16:52,473
and after spraying the word 'Goodbye',

339
00:16:52,473 --> 00:16:54,273
she opened the door again.

340
00:16:54,273 --> 00:16:55,973
Because nobody would push the button

341
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,973
since the "under inspection" sign was hung out,

342
00:16:57,973 --> 00:17:01,673
the elevator would be stopped in position.

343
00:17:01,673 --> 00:17:04,373
All she had left to do was to kill Mr. Fuura

344
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:08,573
when he was taken aback at seeing the word 'Goodbye'.

345
00:17:09,473 --> 00:17:10,673
Then, she waited for the time

346
00:17:10,673 --> 00:17:13,673
Nanami left for the esthetic salon.

347
00:17:13,673 --> 00:17:16,773
Of course the door of the elevator was left open,

348
00:17:16,773 --> 00:17:18,473
and she pushed the button of the floor that she lived on

349
00:17:18,473 --> 00:17:19,673
which was above the 3rd floor

350
00:17:19,673 --> 00:17:21,373
where Nanami would get on the elevator.

351
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:27,025
And, just about when Nanami would come to the elevator,

352
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:28,373
she closed the door and placed the board

353
00:17:28,373 --> 00:17:31,029
with the four tablets attached to it against the door.

354
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:34,073
She streamed the movie after matching the timing with

355
00:17:34,073 --> 00:17:36,373
when he would be shot in the head

356
00:17:36,373 --> 00:17:40,173
just as the elevator was going pass the 3rd floor!

357
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,273
I see.

358
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:47,045
After that if she got off at her own floor

359
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:48,573
and took the board away,

360
00:17:48,573 --> 00:17:50,173
it would end up a perfect murder.

361
00:17:50,173 --> 00:17:53,773
There is no perfect murder to what a human commits.

362
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:57,573
Ms. Izutsu, in fact, goofed here and there.

363
00:17:57,573 --> 00:18:00,273
One of them was when you stuck out your left hand

364
00:18:00,273 --> 00:18:01,473
when the police said

365
00:18:01,473 --> 00:18:03,973
they wanted to check for discharge residue.

366
00:18:03,973 --> 00:18:06,073
It washes off with water, doesn't it?

367
00:18:06,073 --> 00:18:08,073
The discharge residue.

368
00:18:08,073 --> 00:18:10,573
You were holding the towel, the comic and the lighter

369
00:18:10,573 --> 00:18:11,973
in your right hand,

370
00:18:11,973 --> 00:18:14,073
so I suppose you're right-handed.

371
00:18:20,073 --> 00:18:22,073
You went out of your way to shoot Mr. Fuura

372
00:18:22,073 --> 00:18:24,573
who was left-handed with your left hand

373
00:18:24,573 --> 00:18:26,173
to match his actions.

374
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:27,973
If you shot him as is with your right hand,

375
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,473
there would be a discrepancy in the discharge residue

376
00:18:30,473 --> 00:18:33,373
that would remain on the grip of the gun.

377
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:37,095
And the other mistake was the automatic winding wristwatch.

378
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:39,373
Since Mr. Fuura was wearing a wristwatch

379
00:18:39,373 --> 00:18:41,673
different from yours in the image,

380
00:18:41,673 --> 00:18:43,873
you switched your watch with his

381
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,473
that he gave you some time ago, right?

382
00:18:45,473 --> 00:18:49,107
You also shook it a bit to match the time too.

383
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:50,273
Well, I guess the two

384
00:18:50,273 --> 00:18:53,373
who are always wearing it already know, though.

385
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:56,573
If it's shaken only for a little while, it stops right away.

386
00:18:56,573 --> 00:18:57,973
The fact that you didn't know about it,

387
00:18:57,973 --> 00:18:59,573
means that you're the culprit.

388
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:03,121
That wristwatch isn't mine, you know.

389
00:19:05,573 --> 00:19:07,125
The one Mr. Fuura gave me

390
00:19:07,373 --> 00:19:10,273
was a woman's watch and much smaller.

391
00:19:10,273 --> 00:19:13,131
Then, whose watch was it?

392
00:19:14,073 --> 00:19:16,073
Teacher Mizuki's.

393
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:17,473
You remember, don't you?

394
00:19:17,473 --> 00:19:20,173
The old man who hung himself to death last month

395
00:19:20,173 --> 00:19:21,573
in this condo?

396
00:19:21,573 --> 00:19:24,373
The teacher? Don't tell me that...

397
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:27,873
He was my homeroom teacher in high school.

398
00:19:27,873 --> 00:19:30,173
I didn't think he was living in this condo

399
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:33,151
until I ran into him coincidentally at this elevator, though.

400
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:35,573
Then, was this murder committed to avenge

401
00:19:35,573 --> 00:19:39,873
the death of your mentor who was driven to commit suicide?

402
00:19:39,873 --> 00:19:42,273
Well, sort of.

403
00:19:42,273 --> 00:19:47,673
My primary motive was because I was sad, maybe.

404
00:19:47,673 --> 00:19:49,473
Sad?

405
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:53,173
After he committed suicide,

406
00:19:53,173 --> 00:19:57,473
I remembered that I had left my high school album with him

407
00:19:57,473 --> 00:20:02,073
so I asked the manager to let me into his room.

408
00:20:02,073 --> 00:20:04,073
I happened to realize.

409
00:20:04,073 --> 00:20:06,273
That he'd set up a trick to make it look like

410
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:07,973
he was killed by somebody

411
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,773
while he actually committed suicide.

412
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:15,193
Don't you think it's sad?

413
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:16,773
In my cartoons,

414
00:20:16,773 --> 00:20:19,673
a detective would make all kinds of deductions.

415
00:20:19,673 --> 00:20:24,273
And yet, no one realized the trick that was set up.

416
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:27,473
And the case was closed as a suicide case.

417
00:20:43,873 --> 00:20:45,223
That's why.

418
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:49,227
I just wanted to carry out what Mr. Mizuki left unfinished.

419
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:52,673
If not, it would be too unsettling.

420
00:22:24,873 --> 00:22:26,473
You're letting me spend the night

421
00:22:26,473 --> 00:22:28,273
at your place too, Mr. Mouri?

422
00:22:28,273 --> 00:22:29,327
Yes.

423
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:32,973
It'll probably be difficult to get a hotel room from now anyway.

424
00:22:32,973 --> 00:22:34,973
Thank you very much.

425
00:22:34,973 --> 00:22:36,473
Hey, hold it!

426
00:22:36,473 --> 00:22:38,473
You mean all four of us, you,

427
00:22:38,473 --> 00:22:41,339
this brat, Mr. Otaki and I are going to sleep in your room?

428
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:43,341
Packed sardines.

429
00:22:43,341 --> 00:22:48,873
Then, why don't you sleep with us in our room, Conan?

430
00:22:48,873 --> 00:22:49,873
Right!

431
00:22:49,873 --> 00:22:52,873
We'll sleep in one line with Conan in the middle.

432
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:57,355
If it's okay with you two, Ran, I don't mind.

433
00:22:57,573 --> 00:22:59,373
Watch it, you little pervert.

434
00:23:01,873 --> 00:23:03,373
Please excuse me.

435
00:23:04,673 --> 00:23:07,673
Yes, hello. Otaki here.

436
00:23:07,673 --> 00:23:09,367
It's me.

437
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:11,073
Chief of headquarters!

438
00:23:11,073 --> 00:23:13,973
What seems to be the matter? At this time of day?

439
00:23:13,973 --> 00:23:17,773
A troublesome case has just been reported, you see.

440
00:23:17,773 --> 00:23:19,377
I thought of rejecting it

441
00:23:19,573 --> 00:23:21,379
because it's not in our jurisdiction but...

442
00:23:21,573 --> 00:23:23,381
Since you're in Tokyo now,

443
00:23:23,573 --> 00:23:25,973
I figured I'd have you check it out.

444
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:30,073
What is it? This troublesome case?

445
00:23:30,073 --> 00:23:35,073
Otaki, do you think they exist in this world?

446
00:23:35,073 --> 00:23:36,873
Vampires?

447
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,340
Next Conan's Hint:

448
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,460
"Coffin"

449
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,680
Hattori? Talking in his sleep?

450
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,092
You want me to suck your blood?

451
00:23:54,092 --> 00:23:55,420
Oh, the preview of next week.
