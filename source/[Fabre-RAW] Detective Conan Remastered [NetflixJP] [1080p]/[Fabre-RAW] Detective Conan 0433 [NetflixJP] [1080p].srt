1
00:00:01,995 --> 00:00:03,895
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:03,895 --> 00:00:05,695
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:05,695 --> 00:00:07,195
Today's subtitle is a kind of doodad!

4
00:00:07,195 --> 00:00:08,995
You'll see why after watching the episode.

5
00:00:08,995 --> 00:00:10,595
The dying message points to the killer!

6
00:00:10,595 --> 00:00:11,995
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,995 --> 00:00:13,695
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,695 --> 00:00:15,495
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56,671 --> 00:01:58,071
Get out!

10
00:01:58,071 --> 00:01:59,571
Ouch.

11
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:01,671
What do you think you're doing, Dad?

12
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:03,971
Cut out the violence.

13
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:06,471
Don't ever show your face before me again!

14
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:08,171
Please calm down, Mr. Umezu.

15
00:02:09,471 --> 00:02:11,671
"Osamu Umezu (60)" -You wander here and there, and never visited,

16
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:13,471
but the minute I finish moving house,

17
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:15,771
you suddenly appear, saying "Give me money"?

18
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,271
I don't ever want to see your face again!

19
00:02:20,271 --> 00:02:22,771
Dad, wait.

20
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:26,171
Your blood pressure will rise if you get mad.

21
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:27,271
Shut up!

22
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:28,771
Get out of here!

23
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:29,771
Excuse me.

24
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:31,971
Pops!

25
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:33,371
I'm sorry!

26
00:02:33,371 --> 00:02:34,571
Mr. Mouri.

27
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:38,571
Mr. Umezu, this is Mr. Mouri who I was talking about.

28
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:40,071
Nice to meet you.

29
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:47,171
"Conan: A Strange Child"

30
00:02:47,771 --> 00:02:49,671
I've heard about your high reputation.

31
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,371
Here's some tea.

32
00:02:52,371 --> 00:02:53,871
Thank you.

33
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:55,371
Mr. Umezu,

34
00:02:55,371 --> 00:02:58,671
I'm sorry to intrude at a busy time like this when you just moved in.

35
00:02:58,671 --> 00:02:59,971
Takashi, we have a guest.

36
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,171
"Takashi Umezu (25)" -Go on home.

37
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:04,471
I'm not finished talking to you.

38
00:03:04,471 --> 00:03:06,971
Although it's an unlucky story...

39
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:10,571
Some people saw me take illegal drugs, and I'm being blackmailed.

40
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:13,571
They said that they're going to squeak to the police.

41
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:15,371
If that happens,

42
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:16,871
your name will be publicized by the mass media

43
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:19,571
and maybe you'll have to live an unlucky life too, Dad.

44
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:22,071
You're a nominee for some literary award, right?

45
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:25,171
If I get caught, won't it be minus image for you?

46
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,271
They say that they won't turn me in depending on how much I give them.

47
00:03:27,271 --> 00:03:29,171
Lucky story, don't you think?

48
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:30,171
So...

49
00:03:30,171 --> 00:03:31,671
You got to be kidding!

50
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:34,171
What happens to you is none of my business!

51
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:35,771
Get going home!

52
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:37,071
Excuse me,

53
00:03:37,071 --> 00:03:41,071
but this thing about being blackmailed is quite disquieting.

54
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:43,671
Please don't take what he says seriously.

55
00:03:43,671 --> 00:03:46,371
He's just making up stories to get money from me.

56
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:52,271
Sonny, do you want some gum?

57
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:55,071
Gum helps keep the brain active.

58
00:03:55,071 --> 00:03:56,371
Thank you.

59
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:57,371
I'll take it.

60
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:58,371
"Touru Mikami (30)"

61
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:59,671
Who are they?

62
00:03:59,671 --> 00:04:03,071
Detective Kogoro Mouri and Conan.

63
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:07,871
I have read "The road to the 13th Stairs" and was deeply impressed.

64
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:11,671
So I came to get your autograph to keep it as a family treasure.

65
00:04:11,671 --> 00:04:15,071
Dad's book as a family treasure?

66
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:17,671
Maybe it's written by a ghostwriter?

67
00:04:17,671 --> 00:04:23,471
Many senior's publish books are written by their disciples, right?

68
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,371
Takashi, watch your words.

69
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:30,371
You're the one doing the writing, aren't you, Ms. Araki?

70
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:31,871
"Chika Araki (27)" -What?

71
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,171
I thought so.

72
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:38,771
I don't need the money, Dad.

73
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:40,671
I'll write memoirs.

74
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:44,571
"Son Says Father's Best Sellers Are Written By Ghost Writer"

75
00:04:44,571 --> 00:04:45,571
Takashi!

76
00:04:45,571 --> 00:04:48,871
How despicable can you get?

77
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,971
Mr. Umezu, please calm down!

78
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:53,271
Excuse me...

79
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:54,671
I'm sorry, Mr. Mouri.

80
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:57,371
Would you wait for us at the cafe outside?

81
00:04:57,371 --> 00:04:58,371
All right.

82
00:05:06,571 --> 00:05:09,871
You can never tell about people.

83
00:05:09,871 --> 00:05:15,571
I thought he had money and fame, and no worries whatsoever.

84
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:20,771
I'm sorry for what happened, Mr. Mouri.

85
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:23,071
Mr. Umezu's autograph is in the book.

86
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,971
Thank you.

87
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:27,071
And where is he now?

88
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:29,271
He is dispirited.

89
00:05:29,271 --> 00:05:30,671
A bit depressed.

90
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:32,171
He may look to be a dynamic character,

91
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:35,371
but he's quite concerned about how others view him.

92
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:37,371
Isn't that Ms. Araki?

93
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:39,471
Yes. She's going to the police

94
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:41,871
for an interview in place of Mr. Umezu.

95
00:05:41,871 --> 00:05:45,871
It's not easy to be a writer, is it?

96
00:05:45,871 --> 00:05:49,671
Mr. Mikami, what's the truth?

97
00:05:49,671 --> 00:05:51,071
About what?

98
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:53,871
About Ms. Chika Araki being a ghostwriter.

99
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:55,371
Not you too, Mr. Mouri.

100
00:05:55,371 --> 00:05:57,271
You believe Takashi's lie?

101
00:05:57,271 --> 00:06:01,471
No, it's not that.

102
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,771
It's baloney.

103
00:06:04,871 --> 00:06:07,471
That button is unusual.

104
00:06:07,471 --> 00:06:09,371
You mean this?

105
00:06:09,371 --> 00:06:10,871
Mr. Umezu passed it out to all personnel involved

106
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,271
since his book made a big hit.

107
00:06:13,271 --> 00:06:16,771
It's cloisonne work made in the image of a peony.

108
00:06:16,771 --> 00:06:19,171
A peony button.

109
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,071
I guess I'll be on my way, then.

110
00:06:21,071 --> 00:06:22,671
Already?

111
00:06:22,671 --> 00:06:25,371
I have an appointment at a television station from now.

112
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:27,171
If you will excuse me.

113
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:32,671
Mr. Mikami sure is a busy man.

114
00:06:32,671 --> 00:06:34,871
A novelist.

115
00:06:34,871 --> 00:06:36,671
Not bad.

116
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:39,271
I'm going to become a popular novelist.

117
00:06:39,271 --> 00:06:40,271
I've made up my mind.

118
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:46,571
I already bought manuscript papers and pens.

119
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:48,671
All you need now is talent.

120
00:06:48,671 --> 00:06:49,671
Yeah.

121
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:50,671
What?

122
00:06:50,671 --> 00:06:51,671
Huh?

123
00:06:54,671 --> 00:06:56,171
Mr. Mikami?

124
00:06:56,171 --> 00:06:58,671
Mr. Umezu is not answering the phone?

125
00:06:58,671 --> 00:06:59,771
Yes, sir.

126
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:02,171
Since I was bothered about him being depressed, I called him.

127
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,171
But...

128
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:06,471
No, I'm sure I'm just taking my worries overboard.

129
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:08,871
I'll be able to handle this alone.

130
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:10,871
No. Let me go with you.

131
00:07:10,871 --> 00:07:13,671
I haven't thanked Mr. Umezu either.

132
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:15,171
And I would also like to ask what things a novelist should...

133
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:18,671
Mr. Umezu!

134
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,171
Can you hear me, Mr. Umezu?

135
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:22,071
This way, this way! Hurry!

136
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:23,271
Let's see.

137
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:26,071
The spare key for room 503 is...

138
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:29,071
Mr. Umezu!

139
00:07:30,371 --> 00:07:31,471
Mr. Umezu!

140
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:34,671
Mr. Umezu!

141
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:36,471
Mr. Mouri, please call an ambulance!

142
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:38,271
Please call the ambulance right away!

143
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:39,371
Hurry!

144
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:43,471
No, I'm sorry,

145
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:45,771
but there's no need for an ambulance.

146
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:53,971
This is probably some sort of nerve poisoning.

147
00:07:53,971 --> 00:07:56,271
Mr. Mouri, something's written.

148
00:07:57,871 --> 00:08:00,571
"My life as a writer has ended.

149
00:08:00,571 --> 00:08:01,971
I feel total emptiness."

150
00:08:01,971 --> 00:08:04,571
It seems to be a suicide note.

151
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:06,671
Mr. Umezu committed suicide?

152
00:08:06,671 --> 00:08:08,171
Guess so.

153
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:10,971
He put this poison into his coffee.

154
00:08:10,971 --> 00:08:12,171
There's a suicide note.

155
00:08:12,171 --> 00:08:14,271
Moreover, the front entrance of this room,

156
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:17,071
was locked and closed.

157
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:20,071
Hey, the window is slightly open.

158
00:08:20,071 --> 00:08:24,071
-Don't tell me someone entered from that window? -No.

159
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,371
At this height...

160
00:08:27,771 --> 00:08:30,271
it's probably impossible to come in from the window.

161
00:08:31,571 --> 00:08:34,871
By the way, what is he holding in his hand?

162
00:08:36,871 --> 00:08:41,471
That is a sceptre that's held by a Shinto priest,

163
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,771
which was given to him by a fan as a lucky charm,

164
00:08:43,771 --> 00:08:46,471
in hopes that his novel "The Road to the 13th Step"

165
00:08:46,471 --> 00:08:49,071
would win the Literary Award.

166
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:52,671
The sceptre and the award? I don't understand.

167
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:56,371
It seems that this sceptre is made from an Ichii tree.

168
00:08:56,371 --> 00:09:00,171
Ichii can be written as "first place".

169
00:09:00,171 --> 00:09:01,471
I see.

170
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:04,371
He chose to die, but he wanted to win first place.

171
00:09:04,371 --> 00:09:07,171
He died feeling mortified.

172
00:09:08,571 --> 00:09:12,071
Pops, there's something on the corner of the wastebasket.

173
00:09:13,771 --> 00:09:14,771
Blood?

174
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:22,671
He has a wound on the back of his head.

175
00:09:22,671 --> 00:09:25,071
I wonder if he fell and bumped his head.

176
00:09:25,071 --> 00:09:27,771
If so, the waste basket would've been toppled over, right?

177
00:09:27,771 --> 00:09:30,271
He put it back once on his own and...

178
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:31,371
No.

179
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:35,271
A person who's determined to die wouldn't do things like that.

180
00:09:35,271 --> 00:09:38,771
If he were to be pushed by somebody and fell...

181
00:09:38,771 --> 00:09:40,171
Do you mean someone killed Mr. Umezu?

182
00:09:42,671 --> 00:09:46,071
Mr. Mikami, what's this envelope?

183
00:09:46,071 --> 00:09:47,971
Mr. Umezu's manuscript.

184
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:51,871
It's the Weekly Nichiyomi, with the essay, "My Secret" inside it.

185
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:56,171
There were three keys here just a while ago,

186
00:09:56,171 --> 00:09:58,371
but there's only one now.

187
00:09:58,371 --> 00:09:59,671
True.

188
00:09:59,671 --> 00:10:02,971
Maybe Ms. Araki and Takashi took it with them.

189
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:08,171
That means someone was here before the room was locked.

190
00:10:08,171 --> 00:10:09,271
Mr. Mikami,

191
00:10:09,271 --> 00:10:12,771
please contact Inspector Megure of the police department right away.

192
00:10:19,273 --> 00:10:23,973
His woman disciple, Ms. Araki and his son, Takashi.

193
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:27,273
Both were pretty close to the victim,

194
00:10:27,273 --> 00:10:30,873
so they could've been waiting for a chance to poison him.

195
00:10:30,873 --> 00:10:34,873
Moreover, there is a possibility that they have the keys.

196
00:10:34,873 --> 00:10:38,673
There isn't anything here that leads to clues regarding the killer.

197
00:10:38,673 --> 00:10:41,573
I'm not sure if this is supposed to be meaningful.

198
00:10:41,573 --> 00:10:45,373
"From a third person's point of view, they're all ridiculous doodads.

199
00:10:45,373 --> 00:10:47,973
Everyone can see it, but no one can recognize it.

200
00:10:47,973 --> 00:10:52,273
I always leave a certain doodad in my stories for me to enjoy."

201
00:10:52,273 --> 00:10:54,773
That's it.

202
00:10:54,773 --> 00:10:57,673
There's some kind of doodad in this book.

203
00:10:57,673 --> 00:10:59,173
What kind of doodad is it?

204
00:10:59,173 --> 00:11:02,673
Beats me. It's new to me.

205
00:11:02,673 --> 00:11:03,873
Mr. Umezu.

206
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:04,873
Mr. Umezu!

207
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,773
Wait a minute!

208
00:11:07,773 --> 00:11:10,473
Don't touch the corpse.

209
00:11:10,473 --> 00:11:14,473
When you left here, did you take one of the spare keys?

210
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,073
Yes.

211
00:11:16,073 --> 00:11:17,073
Here.

212
00:11:17,073 --> 00:11:19,673
I'll be very straightforward with you.

213
00:11:19,673 --> 00:11:24,273
Mr. Umezu's novel, "The Road to the 13th Step" is a big hit right now,

214
00:11:24,273 --> 00:11:27,473
but I bet that you're not too happy about it?

215
00:11:27,473 --> 00:11:29,173
Just what do you mean?

216
00:11:29,173 --> 00:11:31,373
Please be honest with me.

217
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:34,173
You are the real writer of this book,

218
00:11:34,173 --> 00:11:36,073
isn't it, Ms. Chika Araki?

219
00:11:36,073 --> 00:11:38,373
No, I'm not.

220
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:40,573
I didn't write that book.

221
00:11:40,573 --> 00:11:46,373
You were vexed because Mr. Umezu snatched your work away from you.

222
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,573
That isn't true!

223
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:51,273
Mr. Umezu wrote all his novels on his own.

224
00:11:51,273 --> 00:11:53,573
Even if Ms. Araki were to be the culprit,

225
00:11:53,573 --> 00:11:55,373
why was the window open?

226
00:11:56,673 --> 00:11:58,673
This schedule is...

227
00:11:58,673 --> 00:12:01,173
It looks like the scotch tape was peeled off once and stuck back on again.

228
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:05,473
What's this?

229
00:12:05,473 --> 00:12:07,273
It's slightly puffed up?

230
00:12:07,273 --> 00:12:10,573
Something like a string must have been pulled in through the window.

231
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:14,773
Ms. Araki, do you know what a dying message is?

232
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:16,173
Yes, I do.

233
00:12:17,973 --> 00:12:23,473
His dying message is in the sceptre that Mr. Umezu is holding.

234
00:12:23,473 --> 00:12:25,773
A dying message in the sceptre?

235
00:12:25,773 --> 00:12:27,273
The sceptre seems to be made of material

236
00:12:27,273 --> 00:12:29,773
that is taken from the Ichii tree.

237
00:12:29,773 --> 00:12:33,873
While waiting for you, I decided to look it up in a dictionary.

238
00:12:33,873 --> 00:12:37,473
An Ichii tree is also known as an Araragi tree.

239
00:12:37,473 --> 00:12:38,973
Araragi?

240
00:12:38,973 --> 00:12:42,573
Araki and Araragi. They're very similar.

241
00:12:42,573 --> 00:12:45,173
Isn't that just a coincidence?

242
00:12:45,173 --> 00:12:47,673
Why is he holding the sceptre upside down?

243
00:12:47,673 --> 00:12:49,073
There's no meaning to that.

244
00:12:49,073 --> 00:12:50,373
No meaning?

245
00:12:50,373 --> 00:12:52,873
He probably grabbed at it out of desperation,

246
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:56,373
just as a drowning man would grasp at straw.

247
00:12:56,373 --> 00:12:58,273
Dad died?

248
00:12:58,273 --> 00:13:01,073
Talk about super lucky.

249
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:04,873
Royalty on the books and the estate are all mine.

250
00:13:04,873 --> 00:13:08,973
Your father just died, and all you have to say is "lucky"?

251
00:13:08,973 --> 00:13:09,973
Lucky?

252
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:13,673
This is the key to this room?

253
00:13:13,673 --> 00:13:14,873
Yeah, that's right.

254
00:13:14,873 --> 00:13:17,873
I took it a while ago when Dad wasn't watching.

255
00:13:17,873 --> 00:13:21,373
I was thinking of stealing something valuable when Dad leaves the house,

256
00:13:21,373 --> 00:13:22,573
but I guess I don't need it anymore.

257
00:13:22,573 --> 00:13:25,873
May I do a body check?

258
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:27,073
Yeah, sure.

259
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:30,173
Today's my lucky day. I'll let you do anything you want to.

260
00:13:32,373 --> 00:13:33,373
What's this?

261
00:13:35,073 --> 00:13:37,073
A drug.

262
00:13:37,073 --> 00:13:38,273
What?

263
00:13:38,273 --> 00:13:39,373
I know nothing!

264
00:13:39,373 --> 00:13:40,973
I didn't kill him!

265
00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:42,873
I'm not the one who killed Dad!

266
00:13:44,173 --> 00:13:46,873
Mr. Mikami, say something!

267
00:13:46,873 --> 00:13:48,173
Wait!

268
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:51,673
I've figured it out.

269
00:13:51,673 --> 00:13:53,473
Takashi Umezu,

270
00:13:53,473 --> 00:13:57,873
Mr. Umezu's dying message was referring to you.

271
00:13:58,873 --> 00:14:01,073
Wasn't the message supposed to be Chika Araki?

272
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,073
He made it seem that way,

273
00:14:03,073 --> 00:14:04,873
but there was another message,

274
00:14:04,873 --> 00:14:09,173
and I saw through it.

275
00:14:09,173 --> 00:14:11,973
Another message in the sceptre?

276
00:14:11,973 --> 00:14:13,073
Yes, sir.

277
00:14:13,073 --> 00:14:15,973
About the Ichii tree that this sceptre is made of.

278
00:14:15,973 --> 00:14:16,973
When written in Kanji characters,

279
00:14:16,973 --> 00:14:19,573
the radical is "ki" and beside it is the character "raku".

280
00:14:19,573 --> 00:14:24,973
Inspector, you noticed that the sceptre was upside down.

281
00:14:24,973 --> 00:14:27,573
This was also part of his dying message.

282
00:14:27,573 --> 00:14:29,073
Why was it upside down?

283
00:14:29,073 --> 00:14:30,873
He did not want it to be "ki" and "raku",

284
00:14:30,873 --> 00:14:33,373
but rather "raku" and "ki".

285
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,873
"Raku" and "Ki"?

286
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:38,073
"Raku" and "Ki",

287
00:14:38,073 --> 00:14:40,173
as in lucky?

288
00:14:40,173 --> 00:14:42,673
This man's favourite word, lucky.

289
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,973
I see!

290
00:14:43,973 --> 00:14:45,673
Just what's that supposed to mean?

291
00:14:45,673 --> 00:14:46,673
You got to be kidding!

292
00:14:46,673 --> 00:14:48,273
I didn't do it! It's not me!

293
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:50,573
The sceptre is made out of Ichii.

294
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:52,173
Ichii.

295
00:14:52,173 --> 00:14:53,373
Maybe...

296
00:14:55,873 --> 00:14:57,473
I see!

297
00:14:57,473 --> 00:14:58,573
I got it!

298
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,473
Somewhere around here...

299
00:15:11,273 --> 00:15:12,273
I found it!

300
00:15:17,273 --> 00:15:19,473
Let me go! I didn't do it!

301
00:15:19,473 --> 00:15:23,173
I will have you come with me to the station, too.

302
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,673
I have some things to discuss with the publishers and media,

303
00:15:25,673 --> 00:15:27,473
so if you will excuse me.

304
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:32,373
Conan, where did you go?

305
00:15:32,373 --> 00:15:34,573
I'm hungry, so we're going home.

306
00:15:35,873 --> 00:15:37,073
Huh?

307
00:15:37,073 --> 00:15:39,873
Mr. Mouri, are you all right?

308
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:41,673
Please wait, Inspector Megure.

309
00:15:42,873 --> 00:15:44,973
Those two are not the killer.

310
00:15:46,673 --> 00:15:47,773
Mouri.

311
00:15:47,773 --> 00:15:49,073
Then, who is?

312
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,973
The only others who have the key to this room

313
00:15:50,973 --> 00:15:53,773
besides Mr. Umezu are these two.

314
00:15:53,773 --> 00:15:56,873
It is possible to enter this room without a key.

315
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,973
Even Mr. Mikami can.

316
00:15:58,973 --> 00:16:02,373
All he has to do is have Mr. Umezu open the window from inside.

317
00:16:02,373 --> 00:16:04,073
Mr. Mikami.

318
00:16:04,073 --> 00:16:06,073
I would like to ask you something.

319
00:16:06,073 --> 00:16:08,073
Would you please tell me what you did

320
00:16:08,073 --> 00:16:11,773
after you parted with me outside the coffee shop?

321
00:16:11,773 --> 00:16:15,273
I called Mr. Umezu on the way to the TV station, but got no answer.

322
00:16:15,273 --> 00:16:17,873
So I came here with you.

323
00:16:17,873 --> 00:16:20,673
Isn't that the wrong order?

324
00:16:20,673 --> 00:16:25,173
After you parted with me, you went to the roof of this condo

325
00:16:25,173 --> 00:16:28,473
and suspended a string that was long enough to reach this room.

326
00:16:28,473 --> 00:16:32,873
Then you had Mr. Umezu open the door for you and went inside.

327
00:16:32,873 --> 00:16:37,273
While his attention was diverted, you poisoned his coffee.

328
00:16:42,873 --> 00:16:45,473
You typed the dying message with the computer.

329
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:51,273
Then you pulled the string that was hanging from the roof into the room.

330
00:16:58,573 --> 00:17:04,073
You went out and locked the door then head to the roof.

331
00:17:16,973 --> 00:17:20,673
And just in case somebody sees through your trick,

332
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:24,573
you prepared a killer who is thought to have set up a suicide trick.

333
00:17:24,573 --> 00:17:27,073
That person happened to be Takashi.

334
00:17:27,073 --> 00:17:30,673
In other words, he prepared a guarantee to protect himself.

335
00:17:30,673 --> 00:17:33,973
The poison that came out of Takashi's pocket was probably put inside

336
00:17:33,973 --> 00:17:37,373
when he was arguing with Mr. Umezu.

337
00:17:37,373 --> 00:17:38,773
Mr. Mouri,

338
00:17:38,773 --> 00:17:40,573
that's enough!

339
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:42,273
Everything you're saying is based on assumption.

340
00:17:42,273 --> 00:17:44,373
You have no proof whatsoever.

341
00:17:44,373 --> 00:17:45,673
That's true.

342
00:17:45,673 --> 00:17:49,773
But Mr. Umezu left a dying message behind.

343
00:17:49,773 --> 00:17:51,873
Dying message again?

344
00:17:51,873 --> 00:17:53,273
It's the third time.

345
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:57,073
Mr. Umezu was holding the sceptre upside down.

346
00:17:57,073 --> 00:18:02,073
He was hoping that I would figure it out.

347
00:18:02,073 --> 00:18:05,973
Do you remember Mr. Umezu's sentences in his essay?

348
00:18:05,973 --> 00:18:10,273
"From a third person's point of view, they're all ridiculous doodads.

349
00:18:10,273 --> 00:18:12,873
Everyone can see it, but no one can recognize it.

350
00:18:12,873 --> 00:18:14,873
I always leave a certain doodad in my stories for me to enjoy."

351
00:18:14,873 --> 00:18:16,773
Please look at the bookshelf.

352
00:18:16,773 --> 00:18:19,173
The secret doodad is there.

353
00:18:19,173 --> 00:18:21,173
"A Chicken, a Bird, and a Crocodile."

354
00:18:21,173 --> 00:18:22,773
"A God? A Wolf?"

355
00:18:22,773 --> 00:18:24,073
"Honey and Sin."

356
00:18:24,073 --> 00:18:27,773
"My Mama's Selfishness Towards Me."

357
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,673
These are all like "shinbunshi",

358
00:18:30,673 --> 00:18:33,773
words that are the same forwards and backwards,

359
00:18:33,773 --> 00:18:36,073
also called palindromes.

360
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,573
Among his works are also titles such as

361
00:18:37,573 --> 00:18:40,773
"Don't Cry, Papa Don't Cry" and "Oh No, I'm Doomed"

362
00:18:40,773 --> 00:18:43,573
and many other palindrome titles come to mind.

363
00:18:43,573 --> 00:18:47,673
In other words, sneaking phrases like these secretly into his works

364
00:18:47,673 --> 00:18:50,673
was Mr. Umezu's secret enjoyment.

365
00:18:50,673 --> 00:18:51,973
Mr. Mouri.

366
00:18:51,973 --> 00:18:54,473
Could it be that you suspect me only because my name is Mikami

367
00:18:54,473 --> 00:18:57,673
and can be read from the right or the left and sound the same?

368
00:18:57,673 --> 00:18:59,673
Exactly.

369
00:18:59,673 --> 00:19:01,073
Ridiculous.

370
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:04,373
That's why I had my eyes on you.

371
00:19:04,373 --> 00:19:06,573
That's when I noticed.

372
00:19:06,573 --> 00:19:12,373
The button that was there when I met you at the coffee shop wasn't there.

373
00:19:12,373 --> 00:19:15,273
The button where the material overlay each other.

374
00:19:15,273 --> 00:19:18,173
Did someone pull it off?

375
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:19,373
Please let me check.

376
00:19:24,473 --> 00:19:28,273
After you parted with me, you came back here.

377
00:19:28,273 --> 00:19:31,573
Using the method I explained a while ago, you killed Mr. Umezu.

378
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:38,473
You headed for the television station to create your alibi

379
00:19:38,473 --> 00:19:40,773
and you realized that your button was missing.

380
00:19:40,773 --> 00:19:44,073
If the button is found near Mr. Umezu's body,

381
00:19:44,073 --> 00:19:46,573
everything you thought up till now will go down the drain.

382
00:19:46,573 --> 00:19:49,473
Therefore, you rushed back.

383
00:19:49,473 --> 00:19:52,473
That's where you happened to run into us.

384
00:19:52,473 --> 00:19:54,973
You looked for the button in this room,

385
00:19:54,973 --> 00:19:57,273
but you haven't found it yet.

386
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:01,273
Yet another thing is still not found, too.

387
00:20:01,273 --> 00:20:03,073
It's gum.

388
00:20:03,073 --> 00:20:07,773
Gum that Mr. Umezu always had in his mouth wasn't found.

389
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,073
Officer Takagi,

390
00:20:09,073 --> 00:20:13,673
please check carefully the area that where Mr. Umezu's body was found.

391
00:20:13,673 --> 00:20:16,673
I'm sure that the button and gum are still there.

392
00:20:21,073 --> 00:20:22,173
I found it!

393
00:20:22,173 --> 00:20:23,373
-Chiba! -Yes, sir!

394
00:20:31,373 --> 00:20:32,373
Inspector.

395
00:20:33,973 --> 00:20:37,173
Mr. Mikami, this is your button.

396
00:20:38,473 --> 00:20:40,273
You will admit everything, right?

397
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:45,973
The novel that I wrote was published under Mr. Umezu's name.

398
00:20:45,973 --> 00:20:48,573
He wouldn't even allow me to talk about the book in public,

399
00:20:48,573 --> 00:20:51,873
since everyone would find out that it was in my style of writing.

400
00:20:53,373 --> 00:20:55,573
Is that why you killed Dad?

401
00:20:55,573 --> 00:20:59,573
You should've kept committing murder just within the books you wrote.

402
00:20:59,573 --> 00:21:02,373
You took the wrong road, Mr. Mikami.

403
00:21:02,373 --> 00:21:04,473
You're lucky, Takashi.

404
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:09,473
Your father's estate and all his fortune now belongs to you.

405
00:21:09,473 --> 00:21:12,673
Takashi, the timing couldn't have been better.

406
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:15,273
Inspector Megure will be more than willing to hear you out

407
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:18,873
about the illegal drug that you're being blackmailed on.

408
00:21:18,873 --> 00:21:20,873
Illegal drug?

409
00:21:20,873 --> 00:21:22,173
No...

410
00:21:22,173 --> 00:21:25,173
I'll hear you out all you want.

411
00:21:25,173 --> 00:21:27,673
Officer Takagi, please take him to the station.

412
00:21:27,673 --> 00:21:30,673
-Yes, sir! -No, just a second...

413
00:21:30,673 --> 00:21:31,873
Please wait!

414
00:22:59,773 --> 00:23:01,273
How about it, Pops?

415
00:23:01,273 --> 00:23:02,773
How's your novel coming along?

416
00:23:03,873 --> 00:23:06,373
I have a bit of a problem.

417
00:23:06,373 --> 00:23:09,373
I'm on a roll at the beginning, but when I get to the conclusion

418
00:23:09,373 --> 00:23:11,473
where the case is to be solved,

419
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,473
I remember absolutely nothing.

420
00:23:13,473 --> 00:23:15,273
Of course you don't.

421
00:23:15,273 --> 00:23:18,173
Because all you did was sleep right through it.

422
00:23:18,173 --> 00:23:20,073
It's strange, isn't it, Pops?

423
00:23:20,073 --> 00:23:22,773
I wonder why I can't remember.

424
00:23:22,773 --> 00:23:24,573
By the way, Conan,

425
00:23:24,573 --> 00:23:27,473
I just thought of something interesting.

426
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:28,773
Ready?

427
00:23:28,773 --> 00:23:31,273
Weird Conan Weird. How do you like it?

428
00:23:31,273 --> 00:23:33,073
Weird Conan Weird?

429
00:23:33,073 --> 00:23:36,073
That's right! Weird Conan Weird.

430
00:23:36,073 --> 00:23:37,973
Weird Conan Weird.

431
00:23:37,973 --> 00:23:39,273
It's a palindrome.

432
00:23:42,273 --> 00:23:43,873
What's that supposed to mean?

433
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,420
Next Conan's Hint:

434
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,420
"Dog brushing teeth"

435
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,740
Weird Conan Weird?

436
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,760
Reading from left to right and vice versa.
