1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,680
Alibis, secret codes, tricks, deals.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,880
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,880
Today's the conclusion!

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,780
The criminal and trick appear like magic!

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,180
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,380
A child in appearance with the I.Q of an adult.

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,080
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,490
Ran and Sonoko come to a lodge up in a snowy mountain

9
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,890
to attend a off the net gathering of the Magic Lovers' Group.

10
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,990
However, the board leader of the group, Tsutomu Nishiyama

11
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,790
is murdered at his residence,

12
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,890
and a message hinting that serial killings may be committed

13
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,190
is left behind at the scene.

14
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,090
The suspended bridge which is the only way to get down

15
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,490
from the mountains have been burned,

16
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,890
and the lodge is left secluded.

17
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,690
The corpse of a second victim

18
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,390
is found in the snow by the lodge.

19
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,390
There are no footprints around the corpse.

20
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,290
This is an impossible crime.

21
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,390
Could it be the doings of "Shadow"?

22
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,490
The only member not present at the off the net gathering.

23
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,290
I see. So, that's what it was.

24
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,790
I have figured it out completely.

25
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,790
The trick behind the impossible crime,

26
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,490
as well as the person who carried it out!

27
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:59,690
"The Magic Lovers' Murder Case (Part III)"

28
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,190
Let's see, where shall I start?

29
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,990
Hey!

30
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,090
Behave yourself, will you?

31
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,890
It's okay. One bottle seems to be enough.

32
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:17,190
Um, are there any staples, scissors and a long rope

33
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,290
in this lodge?

34
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,090
Huh?

35
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,190
What are you going to do with those things?

36
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,290
We're going to wait here till morning for police, aren't we?

37
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,990
Since I don't have anything to do, I thought

38
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,790
I'd finish my art homework.

39
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,390
I think I have them in my room.

40
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,790
Let's go get for them together.

41
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,990
Okay.

42
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,590
Oh, here they are.

43
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,690
There, now you have everything you need.

44
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,090
Thank you!

45
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,790
I'd like drawing paper and crayons too.

46
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,590
I know I have some drawing paper,

47
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,290
but wonder if I have crayons.

48
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,790
Hey, sonny, I found some color pencils.

49
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,790
See.

50
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,190
Sonny?

51
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,390
What? Conan disappeared?

52
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,690
Yeah. I just took my eyes off him for a minute, but...

53
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,790
Maybe he went to the restroom?

54
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,390
No, he wasn't in the restroom.

55
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,390
Besides, the arrow of the bow gun

56
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,490
that I had put away also gone.

57
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,690
-Huh? -No...

58
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,090
It can't be...

59
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,790
Don't tell me he was caught by the killer...

60
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,690
That was Conan's voice.

61
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,990
Okay. Let's all go look for him.

62
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,690
Conan? Where are you?

63
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,290
Conan!

64
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,590
Conan.

65
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,790
Ran.

66
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,290
Not again.

67
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,490
There somebody there!

68
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,690
In the woods on the right side this time!

69
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,690
Hey, wait.

70
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,090
Conan!

71
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,090
Wait up!

72
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,090
Hey!

73
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,090
Why don't you behave yourself?

74
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,690
What are you going to do if you run into the killer?

75
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:27,090
But if the killer got hold of the bow gun again...

76
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,390
We'll be his target if we hang around out here like this.

77
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,490
It worked, didn't it, Sonoko?

78
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,290
Huh? What worked?

79
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,290
You know...

80
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,890
That...

81
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,990
-That? -Well...

82
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,690
Sonoko?

83
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,390
Hey.

84
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,990
What's the matter? Snap out of it, will you?

85
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,990
You're the one who's got to snap out of it, Ran.

86
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,190
Huh?

87
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,490
Come and take the bow gun that is behind me.

88
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,990
Why?

89
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,790
Why is the bow gun out here?

90
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,890
Take that to Mr. Hamano's room, the middle room on the 3rd floor.

91
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,290
-Hey. -Just what are you going to do?

92
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,790
Ran and I are going to replay

93
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,690
the scene of the blood smeared magic show

94
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,090
that the killer performed here in the back yard tonight.

95
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,190
What?

96
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,790
Re-act the blood smeared magic show?

97
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,290
Did you figure it out or what?

98
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,490
The mystery of the impossible crime.

99
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,190
Yes. The trick of how the corpse was brought here

100
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,690
to the middle of the backyard

101
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,090
without leaving any footprints in the snow

102
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,390
as well as the person who carried that out.

103
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,290
-What? -What the...

104
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,590
Are you saying that you've figured out who the killer is?

105
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,590
Go, Ran.

106
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,190
Take the bow gun up to Mr. Hamano's room on the 3rd floor.

107
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,790
I've got everything ready up there already.

108
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,390
Okay.

109
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,390
What do you intend to do with the bow gun?

110
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:07,790
The bow gun is not enough, but with a rope and scissors,

111
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,790
this impossible crime becomes possible.

112
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,090
First, open holes

113
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,290
in the back of each of the arrows of the bow gun.

114
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,090
Then pull a rope through each hole.

115
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,690
Make two small loops and tie it.

116
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:24,590
Pull a pre-measured rope through the two loops.

117
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:29,790
A long rope with two other ropes attached to it in the center.

118
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,990
Then tie the two sides of the long ropes

119
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,790
to the railing of the veranda, and it's all set.

120
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,690
All that needs to be done is to fire the arrows

121
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,090
from the bow gun one by one.

122
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,090
Sonoko!

123
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:45,790
I set the arrows up just like it was drawn on the paper!

124
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,290
But, where do I aim when I shoot?

125
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,190
Ran, aim the arrow at the base of this tree!

126
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,990
-Huh? -Don' worry!

127
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,590
If you fail, just do it over again!

128
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:59,090
Shoot so that the ropes don't get tangled!

129
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,490
Okay, I'm going to shoot!

130
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,390
Get out of the way, everybody!

131
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,590
Here goes...

132
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,390
Wait.

133
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,490
Let me shoot it for you.

134
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,790
I'm really good at things like this.

135
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,890
When the heck did he go up there?

136
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,190
Is it okay, Detective Sonoko?

137
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,090
Yes.

138
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,290
Okay, here goes...

139
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,390
Bingo!

140
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:27,090
Cry for joy only after shooting the second arrow!

141
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,790
Shoot the arrow into the base of the tree in the woods

142
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,790
on the other side, right opposite the one you just shot at!

143
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,090
Yes.

144
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,190
The shape of the rope that is made by the arrow

145
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,490
forms into what looks to be that of the two sails a yacht.

146
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,690
What on earth is this?

147
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,490
Oh, can't you tell yet?

148
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,190
Mr. Doito, take out a mattress and use it in place of the corpse.

149
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,990
Attach that to the small loop of the rope that is tied,

150
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,690
and pass it through one of the two ropes

151
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,890
that serves as the mast of the yacht!

152
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,090
Then lower the mattress down the veranda

153
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,990
like a rope way!

154
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,090
The corpse is perfectly placed right in the middle of the back yard.

155
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,490
I see.

156
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,090
Wow.

157
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,790
It's no wonder that there were no footprints

158
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,590
when the corpse was put here.

159
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,690
If the rope is pulled through the belt loops of his slacks,

160
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,890
it would work like a rope way.

161
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,990
That's right.

162
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,690
The killer used the bow gun

163
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:30,090
to instantly create a fulcrum of a rope way in mid-air

164
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,390
and made the impossible, possible.

165
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:37,290
But, how did the killer put all this away?

166
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,990
If the rope were pulled,

167
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:43,090
it would make strange trails in the snow.

168
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:48,690
Nothing like that was left behind at the scene.

169
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,790
No need for worry.

170
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,590
Now, Mr. Doito, tie the other rope

171
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,390
that is the mast of the yacht onto the arrow,

172
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,190
and shoot it out to the air of the woods

173
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,290
on either the right or the left.

174
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,890
At the same time, cut the rope that is tied onto the veranda.

175
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:08,190
Then, all the doubts that you may have had are cleared.

176
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,290
Well?

177
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:22,190
This way, you can get rid of the rope from the back yard

178
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,990
without letting it touch the snow around the corpse, right?

179
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,790
True.

180
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:30,590
But the arrow is still stuck to the tree.

181
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,990
That's why the killer burned the suspended bridge

182
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,890
and cut us off from the world below.

183
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,590
In order to collect the arrows before the police get here.

184
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,990
Right?

185
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,190
Ms. Kikue Tanaka?

186
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,780
Ms. Tanaka's the killer?

187
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,580
Oh, no.

188
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,480
Hey, Sonoko,

189
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,280
I was almost shot with the bow gun by the killer.

190
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,180
Why do I turn out to be the killer?

191
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,080
Why don't you go ask Ran who was with me back then?

192
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,280
Yes,

193
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,880
you tried to fake being a victim

194
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,680
in order to clear yourself from the suspects' list.

195
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,380
So, how?

196
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,780
The tricks easy.

197
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,980
You hammered staples into the wall above the window.

198
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,180
Then you tied a rope to it.

199
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,880
Put weight anywhere on the rope, and pull the remaining rope

200
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,780
through the pole of the railing of the room above,

201
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,180
and go into the room from under the window.

202
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,980
All you have to do now is fix the rope onto the bed,

203
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,680
and hide it under some clothes.

204
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,380
The rope is cut under the pretense of picking up the clothes.

205
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,180
The window pane will crack automatically.

206
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,880
At the same time that the window was cracked,

207
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,880
you fired the bow gun that you had hidden under your clothes,

208
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,880
over your shoulder.

209
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,480
And, while Ran and the others were absorbed in the arrows,

210
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,380
you pulled the rope again,

211
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,080
lifted the weight,

212
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,380
opened the curtains

213
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,180
and made Ran and the others confirm that the glass was cracked.

214
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,480
That way, it would look like somebody

215
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,480
had shot the arrow from outside.

216
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,680
I wonder if it would work out that well.

217
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,580
It will.

218
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,880
Because I shot the arrow a while ago in the same way.

219
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,680
See, the trick that I used is still over there in the room.

220
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,480
Oh, yes.

221
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,680
But, when the arrow came flying through the room a while ago,

222
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,680
another arrow was also shot through the bathroom right below.

223
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,980
That trick is easy too.

224
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,680
You stuck a rope with a weight attached to it

225
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,280
above the window of the bathroom below with staples

226
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,680
and pulled the remaining rope from the railing to above

227
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,980
and used a stopper,

228
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,380
snapping it under the window.

229
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,380
All you had to do next was open the window and remove the stopper,

230
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,680
so that the glass window of the bathroom would crack.

231
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,080
Ms. Tanaka had already stuck an arrow

232
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,680
onto the mirror of this bathroom beforehand.

233
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,480
Then Ms. Tanaka put away all her gadgets

234
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,980
while Ran was heading for the bathroom.

235
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,480
As proof of that,

236
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,180
I found the staples and holes made by them

237
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,680
outside the bathroom.

238
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,280
But, wasn't the bow gun found in the woods?

239
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,780
After everything happened, and we went outside,

240
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,880
you threw the bow gun out there

241
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,880
while we were all distracted by the footprints

242
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,480
that you had made beforehand.

243
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,480
You pulled the arrow out of the tree at that time, right?

244
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,880
The characteristic arrow that was used to move Mr. Hamano's corpse,

245
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,280
the one with a hole in the tip of the back.

246
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,680
You fell on your rear end at that time

247
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,480
from the impact of pulling out the arrow.

248
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,880
Isn't that right?

249
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,280
I'd like to compliment you for your fantastic deduction

250
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,980
but, I couldn't have killed Mr. Hamano.

251
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,580
I was burning firewood for the bath at that time.

252
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,180
It took me approximately 8 minutes.

253
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,980
Wouldn't it be quite difficult for me to burn firewood

254
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,980
go to Mr. Hamano's room

255
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,280
and carry out that impossible crime

256
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,180
in a matter of 8 minutes?

257
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,280
You have no problem if you had set fire to the firewood

258
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,280
for the bath beforehand.

259
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,280
But, I was coincidentally chosen to make the bath, wasn't I?

260
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,680
Coincidentally?

261
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,580
That was no coincidence.

262
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,180
It was magic.

263
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,880
And since you were a preselected spectator

264
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,280
for Mr. Hamano's magic,

265
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,980
you probably knew beforehand who was going to do what.

266
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,580
Preselected?

267
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,580
That magic was done by preparing

268
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,780
paper with marks on the back beforehand.

269
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,080
Then, the preselected, supposedly ignorable spectator

270
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,180
writes the names of the members on each sheet of paper.

271
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,580
The magician, then finally guesses which mark matches who.

272
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,680
But, aren't you the one who marked the sheets at that time?

273
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,280
Yes. I was blind-folded and was given a pen that couldn't write,

274
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,080
that you exchanged for the one you used,

275
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,980
just before giving it to me.

276
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,980
In other words, I had no way of telling that

277
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,080
the pen couldn't write

278
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,080
or that the memo sheets were marked beforehand.

279
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,180
And those around me

280
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:08,280
were lead to believe that I had randomly marked the sheets.

281
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,980
You probably talked Mr. Hamano into doing this magic,

282
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,980
and contrived it so you would be the one to make the bath,

283
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,780
and snuck into the second floor from the eaves of the place

284
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,280
to burn firewood for the bath

285
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,280
where you had already fed the fire beforehand.

286
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,380
Then you waited for Mr. Hamano to confine himself to his room,

287
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,880
and strangled him.

288
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,280
That's how you committed the impossible crime

289
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,280
that was displayed to you just now.

290
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,680
The thief that is said to have broken in here recently,

291
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,080
was probably Ms. Tanaka,

292
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,180
because she had to check on the length of the rope

293
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,580
that was to be used in the trick, as well as to find out

294
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,780
what type of pen was being used here.

295
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,680
If you so insist, I hope you have proof.

296
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,480
Of course, I do.

297
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,980
It's in your boots.

298
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,980
The remaining arrow with a loop on the rear edge of it.

299
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:59,480
I had a reason for making Conan run this way.

300
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,180
I asked him to do so to lure you out here.

301
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,580
You had no time to pull out the arrow

302
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,780
that was stuck to the tree on this side, until a while ago.

303
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,280
The only arrow left now

304
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,180
is the one I used to verify what happened.

305
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,180
You had no choice but to pull it out

306
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,580
when you came out here after Conan.

307
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
The hole.

308
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,180
The hole that was made by the arrow is here.

309
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,180
Right. You couldn't throw the arrow

310
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,980
that you had rigged out here just like that, right?

311
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,680
And what better place is there to hide it but in your boots.

312
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,780
Then, "Shadow" is...

313
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:44,080
Probably an imaginary figure that Ms. Tanaka had created.

314
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,580
She's probably using somebody else's I.D. illegally.

315
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,580
But she participated in the chat

316
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,880
at the same time as did "Shadow".

317
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,080
That's possible so long as you have

318
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,380
a phone line, and two modems and computers.

319
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,480
The handle name, "Shadow",

320
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,480
her name Kikue Tanaka and her I.D.

321
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,080
is probably all that of another person, right?

322
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,780
No, they are both genuinely mine.

323
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:20,180
The granddaughter of Fuden Harui who was lured into

324
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,880
rushing to his death because of all of you.

325
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,780
Fuden Harui's...

326
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,480
Granddaughter?

327
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,880
Then, don't tell me that...

328
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,580
Yes, grandfather was communicating with all of you,

329
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,380
using my I.D.

330
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,280
with the handle name of "Swindler".

331
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,280
I found out only after I was cleaning out his things

332
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,680
and saw the record of the chat.

333
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,780
I was wondering what had come over him

334
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,980
when he started saying he was going to do "Escape Magic" once again

335
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,080
despite his physical condition weakening.

336
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,180
But, that was...

337
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,380
Yes, grandfather decided to do it of his own accord

338
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,780
and died as a result of having done it.

339
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,280
I have no grudge against any of you here.

340
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,880
But, I just couldn't forgive them.

341
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,080
The remarks made by Mr. Nishiyama and Mr. Hamano

342
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,680
after my grandfather died accidentally.

343
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,180
I read the papers too and was surprised.

344
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,980
Well, I'm sure he was delighted to have died on stage like that.

345
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,180
A case of an old man not knowing how to be prudent, I guess?

346
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,280
Grandfather was planning to reveal his identity to all of you

347
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,680
if he succeeded doing "Escape Magic."

348
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,180
What?

349
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,480
"I somehow succeeded."

350
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,180
"Did you all enjoy yourselves?"

351
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:54,980
"From alias "Swindler", Fuden Harui."

352
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,580
When I found this remark left in the computer,

353
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,680
I became sad and vexed.

354
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,080
I just couldn't stop myself.

355
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,180
But...

356
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,680
If those two knew that "Swindler" was Mr. Harui,

357
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,580
they wouldn't have written such a remark.

358
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,280
Yes.

359
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,480
But, he seems to have known.

360
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,880
He?

361
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,580
Mr. Doito.

362
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,380
Because the day before the show,

363
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,780
he sent grandfather an e-mail of encouragement.

364
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,080
But how did he know?

365
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,180
That's probably because he was also a magician.

366
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,380
Huh?

367
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,180
Oh, haven't you figured it out yet?

368
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,780
Katsuki Doito is an anagram.

369
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,980
When you change the order of the letters in his name...

370
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,780
Th... Thief Kid?

371
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,080
Why on earth is he here?

372
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,880
Fantastic deduction, Mr. Detective?

373
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,680
Where's Ran?

374
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,280
She's in the room next door, sleeping comfortably,

375
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,080
wearing a sweet look.

376
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,280
I happen to like her looks.

377
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,780
Skittering here and there, what's on your mind...

378
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:16,880
Handle name, "Red Herring"? I was almost fooled.

379
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,780
I had no such intention.

380
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,580
I came here because I wanted to know

381
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,380
why "Swindler" who had passed away

382
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,180
was still communicating on the net.

383
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,780
"Swindler" was the stage name Fuden Harui used

384
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,280
when he made his debut.

385
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,780
The minute I saw her, I could tell she was his granddaughter,

386
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,580
and I knew she was faking the innocent spectator.

387
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,080
But, I didn't think she would go as far as to commit murder.

388
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,680
By the time I realized what was happening, it was too late.

389
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,980
What a wretch.

390
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,480
Emotional qualities still at times

391
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,180
get in the way of deductions.

392
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,980
I really wanted to keep her

393
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,080
from committing the sad murder.

394
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,180
I'm no detective, and you were half-dead with that cold.

395
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,680
It couldn't be helped.

396
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,180
Let's meet again, renowned detective,

397
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,380
before the bells telling of the coming of the end of the century

398
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,380
stops tolling.

399
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,980
He never fails to put on airs, that guy.

400
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,780
Some time later, the police helicopter,

401
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,380
Pops and Inspector Megure arrived.

402
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,480
Tanaka turned herself in without a fuss

403
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,080
and the case was quietly closed.

404
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,780
However, Sonoko was not quiet.

405
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,780
Ran and I, of all things, right after the case was closed,

406
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,980
was dragged along to a Karaoke Box,

407
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,380
and had to listen to "Sonoko on stage" for 4 long hours.

408
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,780
She seems to have been vexed that

409
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,280
she didn't get to see that thief again.

410
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,280
Three days later.

411
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,780
Hey, Ran. Listen to this.

412
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:48,680
I found another nice guy on the internet.

413
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,380
Oh, what kind of people are they this time?

414
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,280
Raising dwarf trees.

415
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,180
Seriously?

416
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,480
I'm sure he's a sensitive man!

417
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,580
You never learn.
