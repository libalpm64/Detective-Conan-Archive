00:00:03,911 --> 00:00:05,411
Summer shines but only yesterday.

2
00:00:05,411 --> 00:00:07,511
You cry and cry, soccer ball is always there for you.

3
00:00:07,511 --> 00:00:09,011
Genta kicks the ball out of rage.

4
00:00:09,011 --> 00:00:10,911
Yet it leads to the goal of a criminal case.

5
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,311
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,311 --> 00:00:14,011
A child in appearance with the IQ of an adult.

7
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:16,411
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

"Tokyo Spirits 3-3 Big Osaka"

9
00:02:42,155 --> 00:02:44,655
Hide has failed.

10
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:54,655
Tokyo Spirits has lost the quarter final

11
00:02:54,655 --> 00:02:57,355
of the Sunday Cup in a penalty shootout.

12
00:02:57,355 --> 00:02:59,555
Now, they're gone!

13
00:03:05,055 --> 00:03:11,255
"Genta's Knockout Shot (Part 1)"

14
00:03:11,655 --> 00:03:14,055
Alright, let's go and eat cake.

15
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:19,555
Come on.

16
00:04:01,855 --> 00:04:03,055
Come on!

17
00:04:03,055 --> 00:04:06,255
Now, you guys are going to eat the famous cheesecake.

18
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:08,655
So, no more sighs like that, ok?

19
00:04:08,655 --> 00:04:10,255
Games are like a roll of the dice.

20
00:04:10,255 --> 00:04:12,655
Sometimes, when they lose, they lose.

21
00:04:12,655 --> 00:04:14,355
But still.

22
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:17,255
I can't believe Hide missed his penalty kick.

23
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:19,755
Maybe he was out of condition.

24
00:04:19,755 --> 00:04:22,255
I don't think so.

25
00:04:22,255 --> 00:04:25,455
In that game, Hide got one goal, two assists.

26
00:04:25,455 --> 00:04:28,355
He must've been in the best condition.

27
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:30,755
What I'm trying to say is, he's also a son of a man.

28
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:33,355
Sometimes, he buckles under the pressure.

29
00:04:33,355 --> 00:04:35,855
He's a coward, isn't he?

30
00:04:35,855 --> 00:04:38,055
I don't think so.

31
00:04:38,055 --> 00:04:42,655
This superstar that people called a treasure of Italian football,

32
00:04:42,655 --> 00:04:49,755
said "Only those who have the courage to take a penalty, miss them!"

33
00:04:49,755 --> 00:04:51,355
Yeah, that's right!

34
00:04:51,355 --> 00:04:54,255
We take it for granted that penalty kicks are always in and never missed!

35
00:04:54,255 --> 00:04:56,955
Hide was not a coward!

36
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,855
But you know,

37
00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:06,255
we had Hide and Naoki, right?

38
00:05:06,255 --> 00:05:09,155
Tokyo Spirits was winning six games in a row.

39
00:05:09,155 --> 00:05:11,555
They were in really good condition!

40
00:05:11,555 --> 00:05:13,755
How could they lose!

41
00:05:15,555 --> 00:05:17,755
Shoot!

00:05:17,755 --> 00:05:19,555
"Kanji Kojima (28)" -Hey!

43
00:05:19,555 --> 00:05:22,255
What do you think you're doing to my car?

44
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,055
Oh, I'm sorry.

45
00:05:24,055 --> 00:05:28,855
He is upset because his favorite soccer team just lost a game.

46
00:05:28,855 --> 00:05:30,355
Be careful!

47
00:05:31,955 --> 00:05:34,355
Hey, where did the ball go?

48
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:36,655
I don't know. Don't ask me!

49
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:39,255
Genta. Keep this in mind.

50
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,455
"The strong one doesn't win"

51
00:05:41,455 --> 00:05:43,955

"Rutger Heinen (42)" -It's the words that I like.

53
00:05:49,255 --> 00:05:51,555
"Rutger Heinen (42)" -The word that I'm most proud of.

54
00:05:51,555 --> 00:05:53,555
Who the heck are you, old man?

55
00:05:53,555 --> 00:05:57,855
I'm just looking for a kid who kicked this soccer ball

56
00:05:57,855 --> 00:06:02,855
and accidentally cause a damage to my lovely car.

57
00:06:02,855 --> 00:06:05,255
I'm just an unlucky foreigner.

58
00:06:05,255 --> 00:06:08,255
Oh, I'm so sorry about that.

59
00:06:08,255 --> 00:06:10,555
Here.

60
00:06:10,555 --> 00:06:14,155
It's no problem! Don't you worry about it!

61
00:06:14,155 --> 00:06:18,355
Mister, your Japanese is really good for foreigner!

62
00:06:18,355 --> 00:06:20,955
Sure. My wife is Japanese.

63
00:06:20,955 --> 00:06:22,855
When I fall in love,

64
00:06:22,855 --> 00:06:26,955
I love not only that person but also that person's language too.

65
00:06:26,955 --> 00:06:29,555
Actually, I divorced once already.

66
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:33,555
Now I can speak three different languages thanks to that.

67
00:06:33,555 --> 00:06:35,255
Really?

68
00:06:35,255 --> 00:06:39,455
"Batsuichi"? He's been totally Japanized.

69
00:06:39,455 --> 00:06:42,755
Okay, we gotta go to the shop now.

70
00:06:42,755 --> 00:06:45,755
Otherwise, the cheesecake will be all gone!

71
00:06:45,755 --> 00:06:48,655
Oh, yeah! You're right!

72
00:06:48,655 --> 00:06:50,455
What? Cake?

73
00:06:50,455 --> 00:06:53,055
You mean the cake shop called "Ikenaka"

74
00:06:53,055 --> 00:06:55,155
on the second floor here, right?

75
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:58,055
Actually, I came here to buy their cheesecake

76
00:06:58,055 --> 00:07:01,455
because my wife loves them!

77
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:03,155
Second floor?

78
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:06,355
That store is on the third floor, I think.

79
00:07:06,355 --> 00:07:08,555
Yeah, that's right. Third floor.

80
00:07:11,455 --> 00:07:15,155
Hello?

81
00:07:15,155 --> 00:07:18,155
You're always like this.

82
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:22,955
Well... It was from my ex-wife.

83
00:07:22,955 --> 00:07:25,555
She called me about our son's academic future

84
00:07:25,555 --> 00:07:27,655
but the reception was bad here.

85
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,755
If that's a serious topic to discuss,

86
00:07:29,755 --> 00:07:33,155
maybe you should meet and talk to her.

87
00:07:33,155 --> 00:07:36,855
No. It's not that easy to do it.

88
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:41,055
Because your ex-wife is in England.

89
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,655
How did you know that?

90
00:07:42,655 --> 00:07:48,455
The "the strong one doesn't win, the one who wins is strong"

91
00:07:48,455 --> 00:07:50,955
was mentioned by Franz Beckenbauer,

92
00:07:50,955 --> 00:07:53,455
the emperor of German football!

93
00:07:53,455 --> 00:07:57,355
You must be German because you not only like the words

94
00:07:57,355 --> 00:07:59,755
but also are proud of them, right?

95
00:07:59,755 --> 00:08:00,855
Yes.

96
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:05,255
The three languages you can speak include German, Japanese,

97
00:08:05,255 --> 00:08:07,255
and English as you spoke some English words.

98
00:08:07,255 --> 00:08:09,355
Your present wife is Japanese,

99
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:13,055
then your ex-wife would've been someone who could speak English.

100
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,055
But, she could've been American since they spoke English, right?

101
00:08:17,055 --> 00:08:19,255
I got it.

102
00:08:19,255 --> 00:08:21,455
It was the word, "second floor" wasn't it?

103
00:08:21,455 --> 00:08:24,455
In America, you say "third floor",

104
00:08:24,455 --> 00:08:26,955
but in England, you say "second floor".

105
00:08:26,955 --> 00:08:30,555
What do mean? Second means 2, isn't it?

106
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:33,855
English people call the first floor as ground floor.

107
00:08:33,855 --> 00:08:39,555
Above the ground floor is the "first floor", "second" and "third"!

108
00:08:39,555 --> 00:08:44,755
That's why I thought your ex-wife was English.

109
00:08:46,655 --> 00:08:49,455
That kid, is he really a kid?

110
00:08:49,455 --> 00:08:51,955
What? Well...

111
00:08:51,955 --> 00:08:55,555
Well, do you want us to go and buy cake for you?

112
00:08:55,555 --> 00:08:57,755
That would be great,

113
00:08:57,755 --> 00:09:02,155
because it looks like I have to call her back and talk for a while.

114
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:05,355
Can you get a whole cheesecake for me, please?

115
00:09:05,355 --> 00:09:06,355
Sure.

116
00:09:06,355 --> 00:09:08,755
We are going to eat inside the cake shop,

117
00:09:08,755 --> 00:09:11,655
so I think it's going to take a while.

118
00:09:11,655 --> 00:09:14,155
Alright, let's go now!

119
00:09:14,155 --> 00:09:15,355
I'm not going.

120
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,955
-What? -We are going to eat!

121
00:09:17,955 --> 00:09:21,155
Tokyo Spirits lost the game.

122
00:09:21,155 --> 00:09:23,455
I can't eat cake!

123
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,855
Genta?

124
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,955
You guys go and eat!

125
00:09:26,955 --> 00:09:29,255
I am not in the mood!

126
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:32,555
Alright, then. Leave him alone.

127
00:09:32,555 --> 00:09:36,155
We don't wanna eat with someone who's grouchy.

128
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:38,755
Haibara.

129
00:09:38,755 --> 00:09:42,255
Alright, then. You wait silently in the car.

130
00:09:43,455 --> 00:09:45,455
Oh, okay.

131
00:09:55,755 --> 00:09:57,755
What's wrong?

132
00:09:58,955 --> 00:10:01,855
Aren't you eating? It's amazing!

133
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,055
Well...

134
00:10:03,055 --> 00:10:06,755
I'm thinking about Genta. You know.

135
00:10:06,755 --> 00:10:09,355
Come on, don't worry about him.

136
00:10:09,355 --> 00:10:11,355
He'll be okay.

137
00:10:11,355 --> 00:10:13,455
The takeout is ready.

138
00:10:13,455 --> 00:10:15,555
Yes, here.

139
00:10:15,555 --> 00:10:18,155
Sorry to keep you waiting.

140
00:10:18,155 --> 00:10:21,855
This big box is the whole cake for the foreigner.

141
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:25,555
And as you know, this small one is for Genta!

142
00:10:29,155 --> 00:10:30,855
It's yummy!

143
00:10:33,755 --> 00:10:35,655
It's yummy, isn't it?

144
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:47,255
I'm the one... I'm gonna be the one to change the team.

145
00:10:58,955 --> 00:11:03,455
I'm gonna be a much better player than Hide and Naoki

146
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:07,455
and make Tokyo Spirits, an invincible team.

147
00:11:07,755 --> 00:11:09,955
What? Oh, shoot!

148
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,555
Once Genta eats this cake,

149
00:11:15,555 --> 00:11:17,555
he will get over his bad mood for sure!

150
00:11:17,555 --> 00:11:19,055
I'll bet!

151
00:11:22,755 --> 00:11:24,155
-No! -Oh no.

152
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:34,255
I'm so sorry! I was kind of in a hurry.

153
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:41,355
That was dangerous!

154
00:11:41,355 --> 00:11:44,255
I hope the cake is okay.

155
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,455
Driving license?

156
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,455
"Hiromasa Inagaki (35)"

157
00:11:48,955 --> 00:11:51,555
This guy was him?

158
00:11:51,555 --> 00:11:54,255
Hey, what's taking you so long?

159
00:11:56,755 --> 00:11:58,655
Ouch...

160
00:11:58,655 --> 00:12:02,355
Oh, yeah. I tripped and hit my head.

161
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:05,055
How long will it take you to fix it, man?

162
00:12:05,055 --> 00:12:06,455
I'm sorry, sir.

163
00:12:06,455 --> 00:12:08,755
This machine has been acting up recently...

164
00:12:08,755 --> 00:12:11,355
"Tatsuzo Genda (44)" -Hey, I'm gonna break the gate bar

165
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,855
if you don't fix it soon.

166
00:12:12,855 --> 00:12:14,255
You hear me, man?

167
00:12:14,255 --> 00:12:16,255
I'm doing my best.

168
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,455
Ouch...

169
00:12:17,455 --> 00:12:19,455
Where's the ball?

170
00:12:21,155 --> 00:12:22,855
I overdid it.

171
00:12:25,155 --> 00:12:26,855
There it is!

172
00:12:26,855 --> 00:12:29,155
There you are.

173
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:39,455
Legs?

174
00:12:39,455 --> 00:12:43,155
You should go somewhere else or you are gonna catch cold.

175
00:12:55,255 --> 00:12:56,255
Genta!

176
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:07,767
Genta!

177
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:09,467
Hey! Where are you, Genta?

178
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:11,467
What happened, Genta?

179
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:13,067
Genta!

180
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:14,267
Kojima!

181
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:19,867
I found him! He's here!!

182
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:23,267
He's dead...

183
00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:24,767
Genta, what happened?

184
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:26,567
The...

185
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:30,067
The foreign man is lying there dead!

186
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:31,267
What?

187
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:38,967
No.

188
00:13:38,967 --> 00:13:41,167
Although weakly, he is still breathing.

189
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:43,567
Doc! Please call the ambulance and the police!

190
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:44,767
I got it!

191
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:46,467
Hey! What happened?

192
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:48,067
Who did this to you?

193
00:13:51,267 --> 00:13:52,467
Wait!

194
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:54,067
Looks like the injury on his left front forehead

195
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,067
is causing him unable to process words.

196
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:58,067
He couldn't speak too.

197
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:10,267
Criminal.

198
00:14:14,267 --> 00:14:15,867
Me? Is that me?

199
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:17,567
No way!

200
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:18,767
Wait a sec!

201
00:14:18,767 --> 00:14:21,067
Probably, he is pointing

202
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:23,767
at something that's behind Genta.

203
00:14:23,767 --> 00:14:27,967
It might be some kind of clue telling us about the suspect.

204
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:31,867
So, if I move Genta like this,

205
00:14:31,867 --> 00:14:34,667
he will show us what that is.

206
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,967
What?

207
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:39,967
After all, it was still me!

208
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:44,267
E...

209
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:48,367
E...

210
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:50,467
El...

211
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:51,467
No way.

212
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:54,867
Mister! Don't die!

213
00:14:54,867 --> 00:14:58,167
Don't you worry! He just lost his consciousness,

214
00:14:58,167 --> 00:15:00,667
though he's still in critical condition.

215
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,267
Well, that aside,

216
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:05,667
why did he point at Kojima?

217
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:09,367
Genta, didn't you see the suspect

218
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,367
before you found this man bleeding?

219
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:14,067
Maybe that's why he pointed at you.

220
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:17,167
No, I didn't.

221
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:21,367
Because I was stunned when I heard this weird noise.

222
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,367
I missed kicking the ball,

223
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:29,667
tripped and hit my head.

224
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:32,567
I was unconscious for a long time.

225
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:36,567
You were kicking the soccer ball in this parking lot?

226
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:38,367
Yes, I did.

227
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:41,367
That's some dangerous thing you did.

228
00:15:41,367 --> 00:15:43,367
Then, when you woke up,

229
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:45,467
he was here like this, correct?

230
00:15:45,467 --> 00:15:47,867
Well, I was looking for the soccer ball,

231
00:15:47,867 --> 00:15:51,867
and I found it by that foreign man.

232
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,767
Then, it maybe possible that

233
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:56,967
the ball you kicked struck this man's head?

234
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:01,967
Maybe that was why he said the word "criminal" to you.

235
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:03,267
What are you, stupid?

236
00:16:03,267 --> 00:16:06,967
How could a kid's shot injure an adult like this?

237
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:12,667
But Conan's shots always blow criminals away, don't they?

238
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:15,867
Conan's shots are specials.

239
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:19,867
He's using machines. It's all fake!

240
00:16:19,867 --> 00:16:22,867
Fake, huh?

241
00:16:22,867 --> 00:16:24,467
Well, anyway,

242
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:26,667
it's worth believing that Genta is holding some clue

243
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:27,867
to find the criminal!

244
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:31,467
We are going find out who that is.

245
00:16:31,467 --> 00:16:34,867
So don't worry about anything, Genta.

246
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:38,367
I am the criminal...

247
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:40,967
Right. He's not listening.

248
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:45,067
The victim was Mr. Rutger Heinen.

249
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:46,567
He's German.

250
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:49,567
He works for a German sports goods manufacturer

251
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:51,767
and was sent to Japan.

252
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:55,667
He was attacked with the steel pipe that was on ground.

253
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:57,767
According to the wounds,

254
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,367
it seems his head was hit twice,

255
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:01,867
one in the back and one in the front.

256
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:03,967
So, how's the victim's condition?

257
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:05,567
He was sent to a hospital,

258
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:08,867
but he's still unconscious.

259
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:11,067
I thought he might've seen the criminal's face

260
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:13,967
if he was attacked from the front.

261
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,767
This is Mr. Rutger's car.

262
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:19,767
Perhaps, he was waiting for somebody here.

263
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:23,167
As he got out of the car to talk to this person,

264
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,367
the criminal attacked him.

265
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:28,067
You are saying, resentment is the motive?

266
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:29,567
Yes, probably.

267
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:33,867
I found it his wallet in his jacket with plenty of money in it.

268
00:17:33,867 --> 00:17:35,467
It left untouched,

269
00:17:35,467 --> 00:17:37,767
so I don't think money was the motive in this case.

270
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:40,267
Okay. Then you go to where he's working,

271
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,767
and look for the criminal.

272
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:42,867
Yes, sir!

273
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:46,167
It... it was me.

274
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:49,467
It was me...

275
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:50,967
Genta?

276
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:52,867
What the heck are you doing here?

277
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:58,467
It was me who did that to that foreigner...

278
00:17:58,467 --> 00:18:01,567
Well, actually he was the first to find him!

279
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:04,267
He found the foreigner lying there bleeding.

280
00:18:04,267 --> 00:18:05,467
That's right!

281
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:08,767
Really. You guys again?

282
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:12,867
We came here to eat cheesecake

283
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:15,967
and we happened to get to know Mr. Rutger.

284
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:17,367
Oh, Mr. Agasa.

285
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:18,967
He asked us to buy the cake for him.

286
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:23,167
So we came back with his cake, Genta stayed in the parking lot,

287
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:27,467
and found Mr. Rutger lying here injured.

288
00:18:27,467 --> 00:18:31,267
So, Genta, did you see anybody suspicious?

289
00:18:31,267 --> 00:18:33,367
No... I was...

290
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:35,567
We didn't see anybody suspicious

291
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:38,367
but I think money was involved in this case.

292
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,367
What?

293
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:43,467
But Detective Takagi said that the wallet was left untouched.

294
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:47,067
Alright, why don't you take a look inside Mr. Rutger's car?

295
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:50,167
You see the coins?

296
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:51,467
Yeah, I see them.

297
00:18:51,467 --> 00:18:54,767
They are scattered over the passenger's seat.

298
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,667
So, why was money involved?

299
00:18:57,667 --> 00:19:02,667
Actually, I checked inside the car before you came

300
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:07,367
and I found out that there was no parking ticket!

301
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:08,567
What?

302
00:19:08,567 --> 00:19:12,167
Inspector, where do you usually keep your parking ticket?

303
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:14,667
Let's see.

304
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:16,567
Parking ticket, right?

305
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:20,167
In the glove compartment, the pocket of my pants

306
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:21,167
or in the wallet or...

307
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:23,467
I got it. It's the coin purse!

308
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:25,367
The criminal took the coin purse

309
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:29,267
with the parking ticket in it and ran away!

310
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:30,567
I see.

311
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:34,267
The coin purse on the passenger's seat was left open,

312
00:19:34,267 --> 00:19:37,567
and some of the coins dropped when the criminal took it away.

313
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:39,267
Without even checking the wallet

314
00:19:39,267 --> 00:19:42,367
that was full of money in the pocket though?

315
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:44,467
Yeah, because the criminal was feeling so pressed

316
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:46,467
that he couldn't even search around.

317
00:19:46,467 --> 00:19:47,767
Thus, the criminal just took what was in sight,

318
00:19:47,767 --> 00:19:49,167
which was the coin purse!

319
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:50,967
Feeling so pressed?

320
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:53,267
Yes. Maybe.

321
00:19:53,267 --> 00:19:55,567
Perhaps, right after beating Mr. Rutger up,

322
00:19:55,567 --> 00:20:00,467
then the soccer ball Genta kicked came rolling by the car.

323
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:01,967
The criminal must've thought that it would be dangerous

324
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,367
because someone might come over and get the ball.

325
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:06,567
Well, by the sound of Mr. Rutger being hit,

326
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:09,867
the person who kicked the ball was actually stunned tripped,

327
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:13,267
hit his head on the ground and lost consciousness.

328
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:18,067
Actually, it's bad news that the criminal is a robber, isn't it?

329
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:19,167
True.

330
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:22,667
We have to do investigations to get testimony from witnesses.

331
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:24,767
No.

332
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:27,667
There are only three people who are suspicious.

333
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:28,767
What?

334
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:32,567
It seems Mr. Rutger was talking to his ex-wife on the phone

335
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:35,767
while we were buying the cake.

336
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,767
But the reception was bad,

337
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:40,467
so he called her back again and again.

338
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:44,267
And the very last call was made four minutes

339
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:46,467
before we came back here!

340
00:20:46,467 --> 00:20:50,767
That means, the incident occurred within these four minutes, right?

341
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:52,367
Yes.

342
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:54,567
Then, we need the one who was stranded

343
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:57,867
because of the accident at the entrance gate.

344
00:20:57,867 --> 00:21:00,967
And the one who is still in his car.

345
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:03,667
And the one who we saw in front of the elevator

346
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:05,167
connecting the parking lot and the building

347
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:07,867
when we came back to the parking lot.

348
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:16,567
I'm so sorry! I was kind of in a hurry.

349
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,467
He also dropped his driving license.

350
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:20,467
It's this guy.

351
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:24,467
"Driving license" -They are the three suspects!

352
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:26,567
Really?

353
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:28,767
I see. Three people, right?

354
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:30,567
Alright, Takagi!

355
00:21:30,567 --> 00:21:32,367
You search for these two men in this parking lot,

356
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:34,367
and also the man with this driving license.

357
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:36,067
And get them over here, got it?

358
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:37,967
Yes, sir! Understood.

359
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:43,567
The one who has the coin purse is the...

360
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:47,467
He would throw the purse away if he finds that there are only coins.

361
00:21:47,467 --> 00:21:50,167
-What? -But, don't worry!

362
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:53,867
Mr. Rutger left us a hint.

363
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:55,267
A hint?

364
00:21:55,267 --> 00:21:57,267
Before he fainted,

365
00:21:57,267 --> 00:22:00,167
Mr. Rutger pointed his finger at Genta.

366
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:02,167
Saying "criminal".

367
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:03,467
He said that to you?

368
00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:09,067
Yes. It's me, was it?

369
00:22:09,067 --> 00:22:12,967
And he grabbed my shoulder and said "El".

370
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,767
E...

371
00:22:18,767 --> 00:22:22,967
El...

372
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,167
That means, the criminal is someone

373
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:27,267
that has something in common with Genta,

374
00:22:27,267 --> 00:22:31,467
and someone who has something to do with the word "El".

375
00:24:46,867 --> 00:24:49,167
Next Conan's Hint:

376
00:24:49,167 --> 00:24:51,167
"Pesky Kid"

377
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:53,267
I'll be a good kid, so...

378
00:24:53,267 --> 00:24:54,667
Well, you didn't do anything, Genta.

379
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,067
So please, don't take eels away from me!
