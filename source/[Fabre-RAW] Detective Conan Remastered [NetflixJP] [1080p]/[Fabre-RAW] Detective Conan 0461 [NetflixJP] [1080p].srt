1
00:00:01,448 --> 00:00:03,748
Memories!

2
00:00:03,748 --> 00:00:05,848
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:05,848 --> 00:00:08,148
The last page of a book and a stone disappears.

4
00:00:08,148 --> 00:00:09,948
Where will everyone's deduction turn to?

5
00:00:09,948 --> 00:00:11,448
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,448 --> 00:00:13,148
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,148 --> 00:00:15,448
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,550
"Library"

9
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:08,950
Bummers, how long has it been since I wrote my last book report?

10
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,350
Hey, Conan.

11
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,850
You don't look like you want to write your book report.

12
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,350
What? Not really.

13
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,050
What do you mean by not really?

14
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,950
Haibara has gone home long ago.

15
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,750
Ayumi and Genta are both working seriously on it.

16
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,750
I can understand that Ayumi is working hard, but Genta?

17
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,450
What a thing to say.

18
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,050
Conan, you're the only one that's not taking it seriously.

19
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,650
See, look at Genta.

20
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,450
This looks delicious!

21
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,650
Hey, Genta.

22
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,250
Hey, hey.

23
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,550
Okay! I've decided this is what it's going to be.

24
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,050
Hey, Genta!

25
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,950
Do you know what a book report is?

26
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,050
Oh, come on.

27
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,750
Huh?

28
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,250
What's the matter?

29
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,150
Something's strange.

30
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,250
What?

31
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,350
Conan, look at this.

32
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,450
See!

33
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,750
Maybe somebody's just playing a prank?

34
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,450
Why would someone do something like this?

35
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,250
Why don't you choose another book then?

36
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,350
No!

37
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,950
I want to write a book report on this book.

38
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,150
But...

39
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,750
Conan, you'll help me look for it, won't you?

40
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,250
There's a hint.

41
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,250
Maybe if we ask this kid, we'll find out something.

42
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,650
"Tsukasa Naito, 1st grade class A"

43
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,750
You mean, I have to go, too?

44
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,150
I think it's very wrong to rip a page out of a school book.

45
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,450
Give me a break.

46
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:47,850
"The Missing Page"

47
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,450
What's wrong? I mean it looks so good.

48
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,850
That's why I've been explaining from a while ago.

49
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,350
Listen, Genta.

50
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,450
A book report is...

51
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,950
That hurts.

52
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,250
Ouch!

53
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,250
Hold it, mister!

54
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,150
Are you all right, Genta?

55
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,350
How rude can he get?

56
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,050
He didn't even apologize after bumping into you.

57
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,650
I've never seen him before.

58
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,750
No.

59
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:20,950
What's going on over there?

60
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,550
-Let's go and see. -Huh?

61
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,850
"1st grade class A"

62
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,150
I wonder which one he is.

63
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,850
Maybe he already went home?

64
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,650
Is there a Tsukasa Naito here?

65
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,250
Tsukasa is absent today.

66
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,050
I guess it can't be helped then.

67
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,750
Let's go home, too.

68
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,450
He's absent without calling in sick,

69
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,750
so the teacher's worried about him, too.

70
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,450
You mean nobody called from his house?

71
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:56,150
I'm not sure because he just transferred to our school since autumn.

72
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,550
I see.

73
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,050
It looked like he wasn't too happy though.

74
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,750
I wonder if anything happened?

75
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,150
"The Adventures of Aleck" -I wonder...

76
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,150
if it has anything to do with this book?

77
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,850
Oh, that book!

78
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,150
Do you know about it?

79
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:14,050
Yes. Tsukasa told me about it.

80
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,650
Tsukasa did?

81
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,650
Even though school was over, he was still reading it.

82
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,250
So I was kind of curious

83
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,750
and asked him what he was reading.

84
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,950
It's about Aleck.

85
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:29,250
Oh, Aleck is the name of the main character.

86
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,050
One day, he lost the harmonica that he cherished.

87
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,950
So he finds a knowledgeable turtle,

88
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,450
who tells him that if he can find the "Again Stone",

89
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,850
he can get back what he lost.

90
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,450
But in order to find that stone,

91
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,650
one must have a kind and courageous heart.

92
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,750
Aleck tries everything he can and finally found the stone.

93
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,050
When he raises that stone in the air,

94
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,950
the harmonica that he lost comes falling from the sky.

95
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,350
I said that it would be nice if such a stone really existed,

96
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,850
and Tsukasa answered, "Yeah" with a smile.

97
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,050
Hey, let's go there.

98
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,550
Go where?

99
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,150
Where else?

100
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,850
To Tsukasa's house, of course.

101
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,550
What?

102
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,450
Excuse me, excuse me!

103
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,150
Is this a case or something?

104
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,750
Of course not.

105
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,950
Hey, did something happen?

106
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,650
The precious stone that was inside was stolen.

107
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,550
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

108
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,450
-The guy we saw just a while ago. -Huh?

109
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,150
Don't you get it?

110
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,150
I'm sure that he's the stone thief!

111
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,350
What? Are you sure about that?

112
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,450
That's why he fled the way he did.

113
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,950
All right, it's time for Youth Detective Squad to get to work!

114
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:42,950
Genta!

115
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,450
Here goes!

116
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,050
Hey, Genta!

117
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,750
We've got the map too, so I guess we have nothing to worry about.

118
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,750
Yeah.

119
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,050
What's the matter, Ms. Kobayashi?

120
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,150
Conan.

121
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,450
Actually, something troublesome happened.

122
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,150
Troublesome?

123
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,750
Yes. The truth is...

124
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,650
a stone was lent to us from Beika Museum

125
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,650
for a limited period of a week to be put on exhibit.

126
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,150
It has been stolen.

127
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,450
It's a very valuable stone.

128
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,450
And today is the day we promised to return it.

129
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,750
Ms. Kobayashi.

130
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,950
May I look inside the science room?

131
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,150
It was definitely there during yesterday's class.

132
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,250
This is pretty audacious.

133
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,250
It doesn't look like something a professional would do.

134
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,250
"Advent Stone"

135
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,950
Advent Stone?

136
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,750
That's right, the book.

137
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,650
Ayumi, will you please show me that book?

138
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,950
Huh?

139
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,150
Yes.

140
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,150
Here you go!

141
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,850
Thank you.

142
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,050
A stone is definitely here, too.

143
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,150
The Again Stone and the Advent Stone.

144
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,250
"Again Stone"

145
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,250
"Advent Stone"

146
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,550
I see.

147
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,550
The one who stole the stone probably read this book.

148
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,950
Tsukasa returned this book yesterday.

149
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,750
And there's probably no doubt that the stone was stolen

150
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,450
between after school yesterday and today.

151
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,950
What's the matter, Conan?

152
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,450
All right.

153
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,050
Let's go, Ayumi.

154
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,750
To look for the stone thief?

155
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,650
To Tsukasa's house.

156
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,950
I'm starved.

157
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,250
We lost him.

158
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,850
He was just in front of us a second ago.

159
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:40,850
What is it?

160
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,150
That's the stone thief.

161
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,250
Let's go, Mitsuhiko!

162
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,250
Okay!

163
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,450
We lost him again.

164
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,450
No, I'm almost certain he went this way.

165
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,550
"Yakitori Naito"

166
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,250
It could be over here.

167
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,450
Okay!

168
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,750
Hey!

169
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,250
Who are you guys?

170
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,350
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,750
Please spare my life!

172
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,450
Are you saying that Tsukasa is the one who stole the stone?

173
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,650
If Tsukasa is the one who ripped the page off the book,

174
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,650
the probability is high.

175
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,150
If so, Tsukasa's a bad boy.

176
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,250
Like I said, I'm not sure yet.

177
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,750
Here it is.

178
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,950
"Yakitori Naito"

179
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,950
Excuse me.

180
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,750
What are you guys doing here?

181
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,350
Conan?

182
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,550
If you like, why don't you guys have some, too?

183
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,450
Excuse me, sir.

184
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,550
You found out that Tsukasa didn't go to school

185
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,150
after Ms. Kobayashi called you, right?

186
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,550
Don't you have any idea where he could've gone?

187
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,650
Aren't you worried about Tsukasa?

188
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,650
I am, but I'm still going to eat.

189
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,450
It's true that we ended up here by mistake

190
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,850
and is eating thanks to you,

191
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,350
but now that things are out in the light, it's another story.

192
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,550
I'm going to have to open the shop soon, so I'm busy.

193
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,550
Isn't your wife helping you?

194
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,350
It's none of your business!

195
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,550
Hey, sir.

196
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,150
May we take a look at Tsukasa's room?

197
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,250
We may be able to get a clue or something.

198
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,350
Why would you want to do something like that?

199
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,750
Because we're worried about Tsukasa.

200
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,350
What are you doing, Tsukasa?

201
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,450
Nothing.

202
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,650
You're a boy, why don't you go play soccer with your friends or something?

203
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,850
I don't have any friends.

204
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,150
You're Tsukasa's...

205
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,050
Friends.

206
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,950
If my deduction is correct,

207
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,850
after reading that book, Tsukasa found the stone in the science room

208
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,950
and believed that the stone on exhibit was the "Again Stone."

209
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:50,350
He came to school this morning, stole the stone and disappeared.

210
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,150
But why?

211
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:55,850
What on earth is Tsukasa trying to get back?

212
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,250
Conan.

213
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,950
Maybe this is...

214
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:07,150
Tsukasa's mother?

215
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,850
She passed away.

216
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,050
She looks kind.

217
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,350
But now she's no longer around.

218
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,650
Maybe...

219
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:37,335
How was it?

220
00:12:37,335 --> 00:12:40,835
His father doesn't seem to know where this beach is.

221
00:12:40,835 --> 00:12:43,535
Something about it being a secret place that he shared with his mother.

222
00:12:43,535 --> 00:12:44,835
I see.

223
00:12:44,835 --> 00:12:47,535
Could Tsukasa be at this beach?

224
00:12:47,535 --> 00:12:49,035
We still can't know for sure.

225
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,435
Hey, Conan.

226
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:51,735
Did you find anything?

227
00:12:51,735 --> 00:12:53,635
There were a lot of things.

228
00:12:59,935 --> 00:13:02,135
Ayumi, bring me the book.

229
00:13:02,135 --> 00:13:03,635
Okay.

230
00:13:03,635 --> 00:13:05,235
Flipped to the ripped page.

231
00:13:05,235 --> 00:13:06,235
Okay.

232
00:13:09,835 --> 00:13:10,835
All right.

233
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:15,735
There's no mistake that Tsukasa is the one who ripped the page off.

234
00:13:15,735 --> 00:13:20,135
He brought this page home and cut off the unneeded parts.

235
00:13:20,135 --> 00:13:24,335
Which means that Tsukasa is the one who stole the stone, too?

236
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:26,335
Yeah. You did it, Genta!

237
00:13:28,935 --> 00:13:30,135
The stopper's been removed.

238
00:13:31,135 --> 00:13:32,235
Let's open it.

239
00:13:35,435 --> 00:13:37,935
What's this memo about?

240
00:13:37,935 --> 00:13:39,235
Something's written on it.

241
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,535
What does it say?

242
00:13:40,535 --> 00:13:42,135
Crab is scissors, scissors.

243
00:13:42,135 --> 00:13:43,435
The orange is paper.

244
00:13:43,435 --> 00:13:44,935
The green caterpillar is rock.

245
00:13:44,935 --> 00:13:46,735
Paper scissors.

246
00:13:46,735 --> 00:13:47,735
What do you think it is?

247
00:13:47,735 --> 00:13:51,235
It looks like some kind of code.

248
00:13:51,235 --> 00:13:52,335
Sure does.

249
00:13:52,335 --> 00:13:55,135
Genta, you should think about it, too.

250
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:57,135
This could be a hint.

251
00:13:57,135 --> 00:13:59,235
Crab scissors, scissors?

252
00:13:59,235 --> 00:14:00,335
What is this?

253
00:14:01,635 --> 00:14:03,135
What's up, Mitsuhiko?

254
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:05,035
Genta, keep it up.

255
00:14:05,035 --> 00:14:06,735
Keep it up, please.

256
00:14:06,735 --> 00:14:09,235
Keep it up? You mean this?

257
00:14:11,135 --> 00:14:14,135
Crab scissors, scissors.

258
00:14:14,135 --> 00:14:15,435
I've figured it out.

259
00:14:15,435 --> 00:14:18,135
I know what that code means.

260
00:14:18,135 --> 00:14:20,535
This ocean is a secret place that Tsukasa shared

261
00:14:20,535 --> 00:14:22,435
only with his mother, right?

262
00:14:22,435 --> 00:14:25,335
And a code is written on a paper inserted behind the picture.

263
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:26,735
That code means map.

264
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:30,135
In other words, it shows what direction to go.

265
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,135
That's right, Mitsuhiko.

266
00:14:32,135 --> 00:14:34,535
Therefore, well...

267
00:14:34,535 --> 00:14:35,535
You see...

268
00:14:36,535 --> 00:14:39,235
You mean he rode a crab to get there?

269
00:14:39,235 --> 00:14:40,335
That's right.

270
00:14:40,335 --> 00:14:42,135
A crab is red, isn't it?

271
00:14:42,135 --> 00:14:45,335
This stands for the TR Tohto Line.

272
00:14:45,335 --> 00:14:46,635
Keep going.

273
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,635
To make scissors, scissors, you use four fingers.

274
00:14:48,635 --> 00:14:50,335
Therefore...

275
00:14:50,335 --> 00:14:51,435
Station.

276
00:14:51,435 --> 00:14:53,835
I think it stands for the number of stations.

277
00:14:53,835 --> 00:14:55,835
-Okay! -What do you plan to do?

278
00:14:55,835 --> 00:14:57,935
Let's hurry and go before it starts to get dark!

279
00:14:57,935 --> 00:14:59,135
All right.

280
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:05,135
Four stations on the Tohto Line from Beika Station.

281
00:15:05,135 --> 00:15:08,835
Hey, that could work for either inbound or outbound.

282
00:15:08,835 --> 00:15:10,735
The next is orange.

283
00:15:10,735 --> 00:15:12,635
The colour of the train is orange.

284
00:15:12,635 --> 00:15:16,035
The Sakaimachi Line and Minato Line are both orange.

285
00:15:16,035 --> 00:15:17,035
Wait a second.

286
00:15:17,035 --> 00:15:19,235
Why did he put the honorific "san" on the crab?

287
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:21,035
Maybe because the crab is a big shot?

288
00:15:21,035 --> 00:15:22,635
It's platform number 3.

289
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:24,235
The super express leaves from platforms 1 and 2, right?

290
00:15:24,235 --> 00:15:25,235
So if it's platform 3...

291
00:15:25,235 --> 00:15:26,335
It's the train going up.

292
00:15:26,335 --> 00:15:27,335
Yeah.

293
00:15:30,335 --> 00:15:33,135
We transfer to the Minato Line from the next station

294
00:15:33,135 --> 00:15:35,735
and since it's paper from there, we ride five stations.

295
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,735
The problem is after that.

296
00:15:37,735 --> 00:15:38,735
Yes.

297
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:46,435
"Yakitori Naito"

298
00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:47,535
Yes.

299
00:15:47,535 --> 00:15:49,235
Yes, all right.

300
00:15:49,235 --> 00:15:51,035
Thank you for your help.

301
00:16:13,835 --> 00:16:14,935
I'm home!

302
00:16:17,335 --> 00:16:19,535
I really had a lot of fun, Daddy.

303
00:16:21,735 --> 00:16:24,435
Mommy was really funny.

304
00:16:24,435 --> 00:16:26,335
When the wave came...

305
00:16:26,335 --> 00:16:28,435
I keep telling you to come in from the back!

306
00:16:29,935 --> 00:16:31,035
I'm sorry.

307
00:16:31,035 --> 00:16:33,035
This is a gift for you.

308
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:35,535
Next time, let's go together, Daddy.

309
00:16:39,635 --> 00:16:44,135
"Ohama"

310
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:52,435
We're in trouble, Conan.

311
00:16:52,435 --> 00:16:55,935
There seems to be no train we can transfer to from this station.

312
00:16:55,935 --> 00:16:57,735
Stone stands for zero, right?

313
00:16:57,735 --> 00:17:00,435
But there's no such thing as a platform zero, is there?

314
00:17:00,435 --> 00:17:01,935
That's true.

315
00:17:01,935 --> 00:17:03,935
I wonder what the green caterpillar stands for?

316
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,335
A bus terminal.

317
00:17:09,335 --> 00:17:11,535
Bus stop Number 0.

318
00:17:11,535 --> 00:17:14,535
If the green caterpillar stands for a bus, it's possible, right?

319
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:15,635
That's right!

320
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:16,635
Let's go.

321
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,335
So it wasn't a real caterpillar...

322
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,335
Wait up!

323
00:17:22,535 --> 00:17:24,335
Isn't this the green caterpillar?

324
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:25,735
I'm sure it is!

325
00:17:25,735 --> 00:17:27,235
I'll go ask.

326
00:17:27,235 --> 00:17:30,735
Are you sure this is right, Conan?

327
00:17:30,735 --> 00:17:33,235
What if Tsukasa isn't there?

328
00:17:33,235 --> 00:17:35,535
Don't worry about it.

329
00:17:35,535 --> 00:17:36,735
How was it?

330
00:17:36,735 --> 00:17:38,235
No doubt about it.

331
00:17:38,235 --> 00:17:40,035
We go paper, then scissors on that bus.

332
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:43,035
That is, we ride seven stations to Ohama Beach!

333
00:17:44,535 --> 00:17:45,635
That settles it, then.

334
00:17:54,435 --> 00:17:56,935
I'm sure that Tsukasa is at that beach.

335
00:17:59,535 --> 00:18:00,935
The ocean's come into view.

336
00:18:00,935 --> 00:18:02,935
Okay, we're almost there.

337
00:18:11,035 --> 00:18:12,135
It's the ocean, the ocean!

338
00:18:12,135 --> 00:18:14,535
We didn't come here to have fun, you know!

339
00:18:14,535 --> 00:18:16,435
Let's split up and look for him.

340
00:18:16,435 --> 00:18:17,935
Let me know as soon as you find him.

341
00:18:17,935 --> 00:18:19,835
-Okay! -Let's go, too.

342
00:18:19,835 --> 00:18:20,835
Okay.

343
00:18:29,435 --> 00:18:31,735
Please! We've got to find him!

344
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:48,435
Tsukasa.

345
00:18:48,435 --> 00:18:51,935
We've finally found the last page.

346
00:18:52,735 --> 00:18:54,235
Tsukasa?

347
00:18:54,235 --> 00:18:56,935
You're Tsukasa Naito from 1st grade class A, right?

348
00:18:59,035 --> 00:19:01,235
Who are you two?

349
00:19:01,235 --> 00:19:02,735
We're from Teitan Elementary School, just like you.

350
00:19:02,735 --> 00:19:04,335
I'm Conan Edogawa.

351
00:19:04,335 --> 00:19:06,635
I'm Ayumi Yoshida.

352
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:07,635
We...

353
00:19:07,635 --> 00:19:08,835
The ocean, the ocean!

354
00:19:08,835 --> 00:19:11,235
So there you are, Tsukasa!

355
00:19:13,035 --> 00:19:15,435
We've come all the way here, so let's play here for a while.

356
00:19:15,435 --> 00:19:16,435
Why not?

357
00:19:16,435 --> 00:19:17,535
You too, Tsukasa!

358
00:19:17,535 --> 00:19:19,635
-Huh? Okay. -Let's sumo wrestle!

359
00:19:21,735 --> 00:19:25,335
Okay. Let's play sumo!

360
00:19:25,335 --> 00:19:28,835
You're not going to get me!

361
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,235
He's fired up!

362
00:19:32,335 --> 00:19:34,235
Bring it!

363
00:19:34,235 --> 00:19:35,335
I'm ready when you are!

364
00:19:35,335 --> 00:19:37,835
Tsukasa looks to be having fun.

365
00:19:37,835 --> 00:19:39,335
Yeah.

366
00:19:39,335 --> 00:19:42,435
But how did you figure out he was here?

367
00:19:42,435 --> 00:19:44,035
The ocean in that picture

368
00:19:44,035 --> 00:19:46,035
looked just like the padded cloth page in the book.

369
00:19:47,235 --> 00:19:48,235
Is that all?

370
00:19:48,235 --> 00:19:49,535
I thought that there must a reason

371
00:19:49,535 --> 00:19:53,135
for Tsukasa to rip a page off the book and steal the stone.

372
00:19:53,135 --> 00:19:57,835
So I thought of what he might want back despite doing all that he did.

373
00:19:57,835 --> 00:19:59,735
The conclusion was...

374
00:19:59,735 --> 00:20:00,935
His mother?

375
00:20:00,935 --> 00:20:02,635
Yes.

376
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:08,035
Tsukasa wanted to use the power of the stone to get his mother back.

377
00:20:08,035 --> 00:20:11,135
I guess all the rest was thanks to Mitsuhiko's deduction.

378
00:20:12,635 --> 00:20:14,035
-Hey. -Tsukasa!

379
00:20:18,035 --> 00:20:19,135
Daddy?

380
00:20:21,335 --> 00:20:22,335
What about the shop?

381
00:20:22,335 --> 00:20:24,035
It's okay.

382
00:20:24,035 --> 00:20:25,335
How?

383
00:20:25,335 --> 00:20:27,435
How did you know I was here?

384
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,535
This led me here.

385
00:20:29,535 --> 00:20:33,535
"Ohama Beach"

386
00:20:33,535 --> 00:20:36,435
I'm sorry, Daddy.

387
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:40,435
I thought that I could see Mommy if I came here.

388
00:20:56,435 --> 00:20:57,435
I'm sorry.

389
00:21:03,235 --> 00:21:04,535
Tsukasa.

390
00:21:17,035 --> 00:21:19,935
Now that I'm here, I'm hungry again.

391
00:21:19,935 --> 00:21:22,435
Mr. Naito, will you make me some grilled chicken again?

392
00:21:22,435 --> 00:21:24,435
Come on, Genta!

393
00:21:24,435 --> 00:21:25,535
It's okay.

394
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,335
Be friends with Tsukasa from now on too, okay?

395
00:21:27,335 --> 00:21:30,235
Yeah, you can count on me!

396
00:22:59,035 --> 00:23:01,435
Did you find this, Tsukasa?

397
00:23:01,435 --> 00:23:02,435
Ms. Kobayashi.

398
00:23:03,935 --> 00:23:05,935
-Well... -Thank you.

399
00:23:05,935 --> 00:23:09,235
We were all looking for it too, but we couldn't find it anywhere.

400
00:23:17,735 --> 00:23:20,535
Ms. Kobayashi, I took the stone.

401
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,935
I'm happy you decided to tell the truth.

402
00:23:26,935 --> 00:23:29,435
But don't ever do something like this again, okay?

403
00:23:31,835 --> 00:23:32,835
I'm sorry.

404
00:23:36,835 --> 00:23:39,535
Ms. Kobayashi, please look through my homework.

405
00:23:39,535 --> 00:23:41,835
How fast.

406
00:23:41,835 --> 00:23:43,035
"Delicious!"

407
00:23:43,035 --> 00:23:45,635
Is this your book report?

408
00:23:45,635 --> 00:23:47,335
Doesn't it look good?

409
00:23:47,335 --> 00:23:49,335
Come on, Genta!

410
00:23:49,335 --> 00:23:51,635
Our homework is to hand in a book report.

411
00:23:51,635 --> 00:23:54,635
That's more like a picture diary.

412
00:23:54,635 --> 00:23:56,135
Just as would be expected of Genta.

413
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:59,435
I mean, is eating all he has in mind?

414
00:24:46,835 --> 00:24:48,635
Next Conan's Hint:

415
00:24:48,635 --> 00:24:51,235
"A hammer that flashes"

416
00:24:51,235 --> 00:24:52,435
The Black Organization appears!

417
00:24:52,435 --> 00:24:54,035
Each and every colour is mixed.

418
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:55,935
That's the colour of the organization.
