1
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,147
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:07,147 --> 00:00:08,847
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:08,847 --> 00:00:10,647
Today's story's stage is set on a village shrine.

4
00:00:10,647 --> 00:00:12,047
Another meaning to the letters we've been seeing

5
00:00:12,047 --> 00:00:13,747
is hiding an unexpected secret!

6
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:15,347
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:15,347 --> 00:00:16,947
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:16,947 --> 00:00:19,447
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,824 --> 00:02:01,324
"Stag beetles..."

10
00:02:01,324 --> 00:02:05,024
"Hercules beetles..."

11
00:02:09,224 --> 00:02:11,624
It must be around here.

12
00:02:18,624 --> 00:02:21,024
Why do I have to look for insects...

13
00:02:23,224 --> 00:02:26,824
on a hot day like this?

14
00:02:26,824 --> 00:02:30,724
Hey. Mitsuhiko, are you sure they're around here?

15
00:02:32,224 --> 00:02:34,524
Wait a second.

16
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:41,724
Moreover, there's garbage everywhere in this mountain.

17
00:02:41,724 --> 00:02:43,324
It can't help it.

18
00:02:43,324 --> 00:02:46,824
The people from the village usually take turns cleaning up,

19
00:02:46,824 --> 00:02:48,824
but yesterday there was a festival

20
00:02:48,824 --> 00:02:51,524
and a lot of people seem to have come here.

21
00:02:53,224 --> 00:02:54,524
A festival?

22
00:02:54,524 --> 00:02:56,624
It's called the Tento Festival

23
00:02:56,624 --> 00:02:59,124
where people walk through town

24
00:02:59,124 --> 00:03:01,624
with a float decorated with eight million Gods.

25
00:03:01,624 --> 00:03:04,624
Look, that's the shrine over there.

26
00:03:04,624 --> 00:03:08,024
That shrine gate is the starting point.

27
00:03:08,024 --> 00:03:11,124
Behind the float that is lit up with colourful lights,

28
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,624
and fireworks are shot up in the air.

29
00:03:12,624 --> 00:03:15,024
It is indeed a magnificent sight!

30
00:03:16,324 --> 00:03:18,624
Doc, you were here last night?

31
00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:20,824
Well, that's...

32
00:03:22,124 --> 00:03:23,724
What...

33
00:03:24,724 --> 00:03:27,824
Why didn't you bring us with you?

34
00:03:27,824 --> 00:03:29,724
That's not fair!

35
00:03:29,724 --> 00:03:32,124
We wanted to see the fireworks, too!

36
00:03:39,524 --> 00:03:45,224
"Shrine Torii Gate Surprising Code (Part 1)"

37
00:03:45,924 --> 00:03:48,924
We had our reasons, too.

38
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:51,924
Isn't it right, Ai?

39
00:03:51,924 --> 00:03:55,024
Right, I'm sleepy because of it.

40
00:03:55,024 --> 00:03:57,924
You're always sleepy.

41
00:03:57,924 --> 00:04:02,124
What were the two of you doing here?

42
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:04,424
Did you two came here to catch insects?

43
00:04:04,424 --> 00:04:07,024
Well, something like that.

44
00:04:07,024 --> 00:04:08,824
What?

45
00:04:08,824 --> 00:04:12,824
But we didn't see any unicorn beetles or stag beetles.

46
00:04:12,824 --> 00:04:16,624
You can't find any of it just by groping around here and there.

47
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:19,024
I'm not just groping around!

48
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:23,624
I'm selecting trees like saw tooth oak that the unicorn beetles like.

49
00:04:23,624 --> 00:04:28,324
Mitsuhiko, touch the ground of the root.

50
00:04:28,324 --> 00:04:29,624
Hard, isn't it?

51
00:04:29,624 --> 00:04:31,224
Yes.

52
00:04:31,224 --> 00:04:35,124
And there's garbage, but no fallen leaves.

53
00:04:35,124 --> 00:04:37,624
And we don't see any withered trees either, right?

54
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:39,424
The larva of the unicorn beetle

55
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:42,724
grows where fallen leaves have rot and the ground is soft.

56
00:04:42,724 --> 00:04:45,924
The stag beetle grows by withered trees.

57
00:04:45,924 --> 00:04:49,724
So there aren't much of them in groves like these where the ground is hard

58
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:52,824
and routine cleaning is carried out.

59
00:04:52,824 --> 00:04:55,124
You sure know a lot.

60
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:58,024
If we were to look,

61
00:04:58,024 --> 00:05:00,024
it would be in the woods on the other side of our tents.

62
00:05:00,024 --> 00:05:02,524
And I think dawn would be best time to start.

63
00:05:02,524 --> 00:05:05,724
Then let's eat dinner and hit the sack!

64
00:05:05,724 --> 00:05:08,024
But don't expect too much.

65
00:05:08,024 --> 00:05:12,024
The collecting season is from after June until around the middle of August.

66
00:05:12,024 --> 00:05:14,924
These days the nights are a bit chilly

67
00:05:14,924 --> 00:05:18,824
so there's not much tree sap around that the insects favour.

68
00:05:20,724 --> 00:05:22,724
Don't be too disappointed.

69
00:05:22,724 --> 00:05:25,824
I have a little treasure for you instead.

70
00:05:25,824 --> 00:05:27,824
A treasure...

71
00:05:27,824 --> 00:05:30,424
Yes. Something you will like!

72
00:05:30,424 --> 00:05:32,624
Where is it?

73
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:37,724
To find it, you must...

74
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:44,824
You will have to solve this code.

75
00:05:44,824 --> 00:05:46,724
Marumushi (pill bug)?

76
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:47,724
Ni (and)?

77
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:49,024
Tent?

78
00:05:51,124 --> 00:05:52,424
What is that?

79
00:05:52,424 --> 00:05:55,124
Pill bug is the insect that curls up into a round ball

80
00:05:55,124 --> 00:05:56,624
when it's poked at like a roly-poly, right?

81
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:59,724
Are we going to set a tent up over him?

82
00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:02,424
Or maybe it's the ladybug?

83
00:06:03,924 --> 00:06:06,024
I don't get it.

84
00:06:06,024 --> 00:06:07,224
At times like this...

85
00:06:07,224 --> 00:06:09,224
It's...

86
00:06:09,224 --> 00:06:11,324
-That's right. -Right.

87
00:06:11,324 --> 00:06:12,624
It's up to Conan.

88
00:06:12,624 --> 00:06:15,324
What?

89
00:06:15,324 --> 00:06:18,224
No. Don't depend on Edogawa's wits.

90
00:06:18,224 --> 00:06:20,524
Why not, Haibara?

91
00:06:20,524 --> 00:06:23,924
I'm just saying it's not good to depend on others so easily.

92
00:06:23,924 --> 00:06:27,724
You might be able to figure it out if you lie down and think carefully.

93
00:06:27,724 --> 00:06:29,224
And if you still don't get it,

94
00:06:29,224 --> 00:06:31,424
wash your face and start anew.

95
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,524
Start anew.

96
00:06:33,524 --> 00:06:35,624
It's easy to say but...

97
00:06:35,624 --> 00:06:37,924
Doc and Ai are so mean!

98
00:06:39,824 --> 00:06:41,724
-What makes you say that, Ai? -Shinichi.

99
00:06:41,724 --> 00:06:44,224
I have something I want to discuss with you.

100
00:06:44,224 --> 00:06:47,824
Can you go to the place of the code and secretly check things out?

101
00:06:49,224 --> 00:06:50,224
Okay.

102
00:06:50,224 --> 00:06:51,824
If Ai or I go,

103
00:06:51,824 --> 00:06:54,924
they'll probably find out where the coded location is through us.

104
00:07:02,624 --> 00:07:06,624
Don't tell me that you can't decipher my code?

105
00:07:06,624 --> 00:07:07,924
Leave me alone.

106
00:07:07,924 --> 00:07:09,924
Is that right?

107
00:07:13,624 --> 00:07:17,024
This is all because Ai thought it through real hard!

108
00:07:17,024 --> 00:07:18,824
Don't let him get you, Doc.

109
00:07:18,824 --> 00:07:20,124
Huh?

110
00:07:20,124 --> 00:07:25,724
He's just trying to make you happy by making you think you beat him.

111
00:07:25,724 --> 00:07:26,924
Is that right?

112
00:07:28,624 --> 00:07:34,024
It's unthinkable that he can't solve a super simple code like this.

113
00:07:34,024 --> 00:07:36,724
Isn't it right, Mr. Holmes of the age of Heisei?

114
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,224
She's really making me mad.

115
00:07:41,224 --> 00:07:44,124
Conan, you don't get it, too?

116
00:07:44,124 --> 00:07:46,224
Hey, you're just like us!

117
00:07:46,224 --> 00:07:47,724
I'm really glad.

118
00:07:47,724 --> 00:07:50,924
You're just an ordinary first grader after all!

119
00:07:50,924 --> 00:07:52,024
No.

120
00:07:52,024 --> 00:07:54,424
I almost have the answer.

121
00:07:54,424 --> 00:07:57,824
The pill bug is not an insect.

122
00:07:57,824 --> 00:08:01,724
Like the crab and shrimp, it has a hard shell.

123
00:08:01,724 --> 00:08:05,924
Just like a person who protects himself with hard frame work or cloth

124
00:08:05,924 --> 00:08:10,024
when sleeping in a tent in the mountains, so does the pill bug.

125
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:12,424
They can both curl up into a ball.

126
00:08:14,124 --> 00:08:15,124
And...

127
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:20,624
And so...

128
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:28,324
Even if I run the common points together, I still can't solve it.

129
00:08:32,724 --> 00:08:34,024
I've got mail.

130
00:08:34,024 --> 00:08:36,024
Let's talk about the code later.

131
00:08:37,124 --> 00:08:38,624
Conan.

132
00:08:41,524 --> 00:08:43,224
It's from Sonoko.

133
00:08:43,224 --> 00:08:44,624
It's a picture.

134
00:08:49,124 --> 00:08:51,324
What's this?

135
00:08:51,324 --> 00:08:52,824
What on earth is this?

136
00:08:54,724 --> 00:08:56,124
This time it's a phone call.

137
00:08:56,124 --> 00:08:58,124
It's from Ran.

138
00:08:58,124 --> 00:09:00,024
Voice changer, voice changer.

139
00:09:01,024 --> 00:09:03,524
What's he doing?

140
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:05,124
I don't know.

141
00:09:05,124 --> 00:09:07,824
Ran? What's up?

142
00:09:07,824 --> 00:09:10,024
Sorry, Shinichi.

143
00:09:10,024 --> 00:09:13,024
Sonoko just sent you a picture, right?

144
00:09:13,024 --> 00:09:15,124
Erase it right now!

145
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:18,624
Don't erase it!

146
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:23,124
I took Ran's special sexy shot.

147
00:09:23,124 --> 00:09:26,424
Hey, Sonoko! What are you saying?

148
00:09:26,424 --> 00:09:29,124
Special sexy shot?

149
00:09:29,124 --> 00:09:31,224
Then this is...

150
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:35,424
Ran's...

151
00:09:36,424 --> 00:09:37,624
It's bleeding.

152
00:09:40,924 --> 00:09:45,424
Right, Ran and Sonoko were saying they were going to the beach.

153
00:09:45,424 --> 00:09:49,124
Hey. Who are you talking to, Conan?

154
00:09:49,124 --> 00:09:51,324
What? Conan?

155
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,524
-Is Conan nearby? -Oh, no!

156
00:09:56,324 --> 00:09:57,524
Kona coffee.

157
00:09:57,524 --> 00:10:01,024
It's the kona coffee I'm drinking right now.

158
00:10:02,424 --> 00:10:06,124
Don't drink too much.

159
00:10:06,124 --> 00:10:07,224
Okay.

160
00:10:07,224 --> 00:10:09,524
I'm going to hang up if that's all you have to say.

161
00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:12,824
The picture...

162
00:10:12,824 --> 00:10:15,524
I know! I'll erase it.

163
00:10:15,524 --> 00:10:16,524
See you!

164
00:10:18,024 --> 00:10:19,724
Save, save.

165
00:10:21,724 --> 00:10:26,124
She'll find out sooner or later.

166
00:10:27,424 --> 00:10:31,324
Hey! I've found the pill bug!

167
00:10:31,324 --> 00:10:33,224
Where did you find it?

168
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:35,924
I bet you just turned over a rock or something, right?

169
00:10:35,924 --> 00:10:38,624
No! No!

170
00:10:38,624 --> 00:10:42,124
I found it! On the other side of the woods.

171
00:10:42,124 --> 00:10:43,424
You found it?

172
00:10:46,124 --> 00:10:49,224
Is it true, Genta?

173
00:10:49,224 --> 00:10:51,124
See, we're here.

174
00:10:51,124 --> 00:10:53,124
There, over there.

175
00:10:53,124 --> 00:10:54,724
Look there!

176
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:57,424
It's "marumushi", right?

177
00:10:57,424 --> 00:11:00,024
Marumushi Hot Spring?

178
00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:03,824
I've heard of a Asamushi Hot Spring, but...

179
00:11:03,824 --> 00:11:06,824
It's such a lonely hot spring inn.

180
00:11:06,824 --> 00:11:09,024
The sign is coming off.

181
00:11:09,024 --> 00:11:12,924
There's probably a tent inside that inn, right?

182
00:11:12,924 --> 00:11:16,424
There must be a key to the code in that tent!

183
00:11:16,424 --> 00:11:18,224
Then, let's go!

184
00:11:21,524 --> 00:11:22,724
Let's go!

185
00:11:25,824 --> 00:11:27,924
I don't see the point...

186
00:11:29,424 --> 00:11:32,224
of saying that so enthusiastically.

187
00:11:40,168 --> 00:11:42,268
How strange.

188
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:46,868
I thought there was something at Marumushi Hot Spring.

189
00:11:46,868 --> 00:11:50,168
That inn is closed down, and there is no tent in there.

190
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,468
Yes. There was no one there, too.

191
00:11:54,368 --> 00:11:56,168
So what do you say? Give up?

192
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,868
I guess so.

193
00:11:59,868 --> 00:12:01,268
Unfortunately...

194
00:12:01,268 --> 00:12:03,268
So show us the treasure.

195
00:12:03,268 --> 00:12:06,368
Actually this code is...

196
00:12:08,668 --> 00:12:10,068
Doc, wait!

197
00:12:11,968 --> 00:12:14,968
There's one person who still hasn't given up.

198
00:12:22,168 --> 00:12:23,368
Hey.

199
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,968
Conan?

200
00:12:24,968 --> 00:12:27,668
Why don't you just give up?

201
00:12:27,668 --> 00:12:31,368
There are times like this.

202
00:12:31,368 --> 00:12:32,968
But it's so odd.

203
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:36,968
Conan love codes so much and are able to solve them easily.

204
00:12:36,968 --> 00:12:39,268
Maybe you're suffering from the summer heat?

205
00:12:40,268 --> 00:12:42,268
Shut up.

206
00:12:43,268 --> 00:12:46,068
It's just that I can't really get into it.

207
00:12:46,068 --> 00:12:48,268
Especially when it's not connected to a case.

208
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,068
A phone call.

209
00:12:57,168 --> 00:12:58,168
It's Ran again.

210
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:04,368
What can it be this time?

211
00:13:06,768 --> 00:13:08,468
Yes, hello?

212
00:13:08,468 --> 00:13:11,068
Shinichi? Please help me!

213
00:13:12,268 --> 00:13:13,568
Someone's been killed.

214
00:13:13,568 --> 00:13:16,668
Sonoko and I were also attacked and we're in trouble!

215
00:13:16,668 --> 00:13:21,168
What? Are you in the middle of running away from the killer?

216
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,468
No, we're alright now.

217
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:24,768
We're not hurt.

218
00:13:24,768 --> 00:13:27,668
We're with the police right now.

219
00:13:27,668 --> 00:13:28,968
And? Who was killed?

220
00:13:28,968 --> 00:13:32,868
A man called Miyama who was staying in the same hotel as us!

221
00:13:32,868 --> 00:13:36,068
Then were you attacked because you saw the killer?

222
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:37,668
No, we didn't see him.

223
00:13:37,668 --> 00:13:42,568
We found out that the man was killed only after the police informed us.

224
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:45,668
What? You were attacked despite the police being there?

225
00:13:45,668 --> 00:13:50,668
No, we were attacked on our way back from the police!

226
00:13:50,668 --> 00:13:53,068
It was too dark to see who it was though.

227
00:13:53,068 --> 00:13:54,968
Is the one who attacked you is the killer?

228
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:56,168
I don't know.

229
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,268
That person ran off with Sonoko's bag,

230
00:13:58,268 --> 00:14:00,168
-so maybe it was just a purse-snatcher. -Hey!

231
00:14:00,168 --> 00:14:01,668
What are you doing?

232
00:14:01,668 --> 00:14:02,968
Give it back!

233
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:06,368
Why did you go to the police at night?

234
00:14:06,368 --> 00:14:10,768
Sonoko remembered that there was something written on the window

235
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:14,168
of the hotel room where the man was killed.

236
00:14:14,168 --> 00:14:17,468
So we went to the police to tell them about it.

237
00:14:17,468 --> 00:14:18,468
What kind of writing?

238
00:14:19,768 --> 00:14:22,068
Something like a code.

239
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:23,068
A code?

240
00:14:23,068 --> 00:14:24,768
What are you so happy about?

241
00:14:24,768 --> 00:14:26,868
Someone died, you know.

242
00:14:26,868 --> 00:14:28,668
Sorry.

243
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,868
And what was written?

244
00:14:32,968 --> 00:14:34,168
According to Sonoko,

245
00:14:34,168 --> 00:14:37,668
it was written in red by something similar to lipstick.

246
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,868
There were four alphabets written in small letters,

247
00:14:40,868 --> 00:14:43,968
"t, e, i, u".

248
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:45,968
"Teiu?"

249
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:51,268
Yes. So Sonoko thinks the victim probably left a message.

250
00:14:51,268 --> 00:14:52,668
It's not probably!

251
00:14:52,668 --> 00:14:55,468
That is definitely a dying message!

252
00:14:55,468 --> 00:14:59,768
The victim probably wanted to say "teiuka".

253
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,168
Sonoko.

254
00:15:05,668 --> 00:15:06,968
It is so-called...

255
00:15:08,968 --> 00:15:14,268
"The Teiuka Homicide"

256
00:15:16,368 --> 00:15:20,568
What? The teiuka homicide?

257
00:15:20,568 --> 00:15:22,668
Sonoko, quit fooling around.

258
00:15:22,668 --> 00:15:24,768
I'm not fooling around!

259
00:15:24,768 --> 00:15:27,568
A man called Miyama was killed

260
00:15:27,568 --> 00:15:31,568
and on his window were the letters "teiu"!

261
00:15:31,568 --> 00:15:34,168
"T, e, i, u".

262
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:37,068
With the letters "teiu", then it must be "teiuka"

263
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:40,068
that he wanted to leave as a message, right?

264
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:44,068
When we met Mr. Miyama on the beach,

265
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,768
he kept using the word "teiuka".

266
00:15:46,768 --> 00:15:51,868
So whatever you say, it's the teiuka homicide.

267
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:58,368
Was the "I" in "teiu" is the alphabet "L"?

268
00:15:58,368 --> 00:16:03,268
"L"? Well, maybe.

269
00:16:03,268 --> 00:16:05,768
So what if it is?

270
00:16:05,768 --> 00:16:07,568
And the fourth letter "u",

271
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:10,668
wasn't the length of the right side is a little shorter than the left?

272
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:11,668
What?

273
00:16:11,668 --> 00:16:14,968
So I'm asking if it is the "shi" character in hiragana!

274
00:16:15,968 --> 00:16:17,568
Now that you mentioned it,

275
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:19,868
it might have been that.

276
00:16:19,868 --> 00:16:25,068
Think of the "shi" coming right after the alphabets "tel".

277
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:29,168
Tel... tel shi?

278
00:16:29,168 --> 00:16:30,268
I get it!

279
00:16:30,268 --> 00:16:32,568
"Please tel" it means "please call",

280
00:16:32,568 --> 00:16:34,968
and he was trying to call for help.

281
00:16:34,968 --> 00:16:37,768
I knew you could do it, Shinichi!

282
00:16:37,768 --> 00:16:38,968
Yes, yes.

283
00:16:38,968 --> 00:16:42,068
Your hubby is great. Very great.

284
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:43,668
He's not my hubby!

285
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:46,268
What are you saying, Sonoko?

286
00:16:46,268 --> 00:16:48,168
Ran, your face are red!

287
00:16:48,168 --> 00:16:50,968
In what situation was the man killed?

288
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,468
Oh, right.

289
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:54,568
According to the police,

290
00:16:54,568 --> 00:16:56,768
he was lying on the floor bleeding from his head

291
00:16:56,768 --> 00:16:59,568
near the window of the hotel.

292
00:16:59,568 --> 00:17:02,968
He was hit by something hard from the back.

293
00:17:04,568 --> 00:17:08,068
If he was trying to write "tel shite",

294
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:11,868
that guy probably wrote it with his own blood.

295
00:17:11,868 --> 00:17:13,368
What?

296
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:15,168
The letters written in red, right?

297
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:18,068
And who found the body?

298
00:17:18,068 --> 00:17:21,368
The three friends of Mr. Miyama who was killed.

299
00:17:22,368 --> 00:17:26,968
If I'm not mistaken, Mr. Kano the classmate of Mr. Miyama,

300
00:17:26,968 --> 00:17:30,068
Ms. Yanuma, Mr. Miyama's girlfriend,

301
00:17:30,068 --> 00:17:33,668
and Mr. Bito, a colleague at a part-time job they both worked for.

302
00:17:34,768 --> 00:17:37,368
Mr. Miyama and the three of them were planning to have dinner together.

303
00:17:37,368 --> 00:17:39,868
So they went to his room to get him because he didn't come.

304
00:17:39,868 --> 00:17:45,868
They found the door was unlocked and the window was broken.

305
00:17:45,868 --> 00:17:48,968
Mr. Miyama was found on the floor near the window.

306
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:50,768
This is what they testified to the police.

307
00:17:51,768 --> 00:17:53,468
The window was broken?

308
00:17:54,568 --> 00:18:00,568
That's why the police say that the killer broke in from the window.

309
00:18:00,568 --> 00:18:02,968
When Sonoko went to the police

310
00:18:02,968 --> 00:18:05,768
to tell them about the letters that were written on the window,

311
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:10,368
they didn't find anything of that sort among the broken pieces of glass.

312
00:18:10,368 --> 00:18:15,868
The letters "teiu" were not understandable so wouldn't believe us either.

313
00:18:15,868 --> 00:18:18,768
So I told the police

314
00:18:18,768 --> 00:18:21,468
that I'd bring the evidence to them!

315
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:23,468
Hey, Sonoko.

316
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:25,568
Do you really have the evidence?

317
00:18:25,568 --> 00:18:27,868
Don't you remember that I sent it to you, Kudo?

318
00:18:27,868 --> 00:18:29,468
What?

319
00:18:29,468 --> 00:18:33,868
The special sexy shot of Ran that I took with my cell phone!

320
00:18:33,868 --> 00:18:36,968
I noticed the red letters before I took the picture,

321
00:18:36,968 --> 00:18:39,168
so it should be in the background of Ran's picture!

322
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:40,568
What do you mean by "should be"?

323
00:18:40,568 --> 00:18:42,668
You haven't checked?

324
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:47,368
No. I thought I left my cell phone back at the hotel,

325
00:18:47,368 --> 00:18:50,568
so we headed back from the police station to go get it.

326
00:18:50,568 --> 00:18:54,368
But half way back, I realize that it was in my bag.

327
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:57,168
So we were heading back to the police station again

328
00:18:57,168 --> 00:18:58,868
when I was unfortunately mugged

329
00:18:58,868 --> 00:19:00,968
and my bag was taken.

330
00:19:00,968 --> 00:19:03,468
I didn't want to be called a liar

331
00:19:03,468 --> 00:19:09,168
so I told Ran to call you and ask you to send me back that picture!

332
00:19:09,168 --> 00:19:10,368
Huh?

333
00:19:10,368 --> 00:19:12,368
I told her that you probably erased it,

334
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:15,068
and that it would be no use to call you.

335
00:19:15,068 --> 00:19:16,568
You erased it, right?

336
00:19:16,568 --> 00:19:19,568
Yes, of course.

337
00:19:19,568 --> 00:19:20,968
You see!

338
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:22,668
Really?

339
00:19:22,668 --> 00:19:24,068
Anyway,

340
00:19:24,068 --> 00:19:26,268
you know the meaning of the letters now,

341
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:28,268
so go tell the police about it.

342
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:31,868
Okay! I'll call if something comes up.

343
00:19:31,868 --> 00:19:33,768
Okay.

344
00:19:33,768 --> 00:19:37,568
That sexy shot... Did he really erased it?

345
00:19:37,568 --> 00:19:41,568
Picture, picture.

346
00:19:41,568 --> 00:19:42,568
Found it.

347
00:19:42,568 --> 00:19:44,668
There's the red letters.

348
00:19:46,568 --> 00:19:50,268
There's something written on the window just like Sonoko said.

349
00:19:50,268 --> 00:19:54,268
The curtain is closed so it's not possible to look inside the room.

350
00:19:54,268 --> 00:19:56,968
Only the letter "t" which is hidden behind Ran's hips is in view.

351
00:19:59,668 --> 00:20:02,868
There's something written in red besides the "t".

352
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,868
Could it be a comma or a slip of the pen?

353
00:20:05,868 --> 00:20:08,568
What a weird killer

354
00:20:08,568 --> 00:20:11,468
if the dying message were to be "tel shite".

355
00:20:11,468 --> 00:20:13,268
Some time after committing the murder,

356
00:20:13,268 --> 00:20:14,768
he must've noticed the writing

357
00:20:14,768 --> 00:20:18,568
and broke the window to retrieve the pieces with writings on them.

358
00:20:18,568 --> 00:20:21,168
Even if it were to be an attempt to delay the discovery of the body,

359
00:20:21,168 --> 00:20:23,368
breaking the window would risk attracting more attention

360
00:20:23,368 --> 00:20:26,368
and hastening the discovery.

361
00:20:26,368 --> 00:20:30,168
What are you looking at, Conan?

362
00:20:30,168 --> 00:20:31,768
What?

363
00:20:31,768 --> 00:20:33,468
What is it?

364
00:20:33,468 --> 00:20:37,268
Hey! That's... It's a woman's nude, isn't it?

365
00:20:38,868 --> 00:20:42,668
Conan, it might be against the law

366
00:20:42,668 --> 00:20:45,368
if a grade schooler looks at a picture like that!

367
00:20:45,368 --> 00:20:46,768
It's not.

368
00:20:49,268 --> 00:20:51,268
It's just a spam mail.

369
00:20:51,268 --> 00:20:54,368
When I accessed the site to the mail,

370
00:20:54,368 --> 00:20:57,268
I just happened to get this picture.

371
00:20:57,268 --> 00:21:00,568
By the way, were you guys able to decipher Doc's code?

372
00:21:00,568 --> 00:21:02,968
No. Not at all.

373
00:21:02,968 --> 00:21:05,168
No way!

374
00:21:05,168 --> 00:21:07,568
If even you can't, how could we?

375
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:13,968
We borrowed the paper with the code "pill bug and a tent".

376
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:15,468
Pill bug...

377
00:21:15,468 --> 00:21:17,268
I wonder if we'll really be able to find the site of the treasure

378
00:21:17,268 --> 00:21:19,668
after deciphering this code?

379
00:21:19,668 --> 00:21:21,468
If I were to choose,

380
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:25,868
I would rather have come here for the festival Dr. Agasa went to.

381
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,868
Festival?

382
00:21:27,868 --> 00:21:32,568
Wasn't that festival called the Tento Festival?

383
00:21:32,568 --> 00:21:33,568
What?

384
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,368
What did you just say?

385
00:21:35,368 --> 00:21:39,168
You can see the shrine gate that lit up, right?

386
00:21:39,168 --> 00:21:43,168
Doc said that it's a village festival and the float starts from there.

387
00:21:44,268 --> 00:21:49,268
Then, is the "tent" in the code points to the Tento festival?

388
00:21:49,268 --> 00:21:53,268
Even so, I still don't understand the pill bug part.

389
00:21:53,268 --> 00:21:57,968
I still think it has something to do with the Marumushi Hot Spring.

390
00:21:57,968 --> 00:22:00,468
But that place was closed down.

391
00:22:01,468 --> 00:22:03,468
The entrance was closed

392
00:22:03,468 --> 00:22:06,168
and no one answered our calls.

393
00:22:07,568 --> 00:22:08,668
What is it?

394
00:22:08,668 --> 00:22:12,768
Hey, look! Something's getting bright.

395
00:22:12,768 --> 00:22:14,868
That's where...

396
00:22:14,868 --> 00:22:17,268
Marumushi Hot Spring is located.

397
00:22:18,268 --> 00:22:20,468
"Pill bug and tent..."

398
00:22:20,468 --> 00:22:22,368
Does that mean to light it up?

399
00:22:22,368 --> 00:22:25,468
That's it! That must be it!

400
00:22:25,468 --> 00:22:27,268
I'm getting it.

401
00:22:27,268 --> 00:22:28,668
Okay!

402
00:22:28,668 --> 00:22:30,568
Let's go!

403
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,595
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:34,595 --> 00:24:36,295
"Back and front"

405
00:24:36,295 --> 00:24:37,995
Words that can be read from right to left!

406
00:24:37,995 --> 00:24:38,995
Deed.

407
00:24:38,995 --> 00:24:40,995
-Great! -Ear.
