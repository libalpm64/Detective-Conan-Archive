1
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:06,356
One moment please.

2
00:00:06,356 --> 00:00:09,756
But, Haruka. It's amazing you got a hold of the ticket

3
00:00:09,756 --> 00:00:12,556
for the Black Roses Live.

4
00:00:12,556 --> 00:00:14,356
It was a present from him.

5
00:00:14,356 --> 00:00:17,056
What? You mean that nameless guitarist?

6
00:00:17,056 --> 00:00:20,356
Yep. The day is his birthday, you see!

7
00:00:20,356 --> 00:00:22,756
And he says he wants me to celebrate it with him.

8
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:26,356
I see. It's surprising how he came up with the cash.

9
00:00:26,356 --> 00:00:28,856
Thank you for waiting.

10
00:00:28,856 --> 00:00:32,756
I clicked at exactly 10:00 sharp, but couldn't get through.

11
00:00:32,756 --> 00:00:34,556
I'm sorry, Sonoko.

12
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:36,356
See, I told you, didn't I?

13
00:00:36,356 --> 00:00:38,856
That's it's going to be horrendous trying to get tickets

14
00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:41,056
being that it's going to be their one and only Japan tour.

15
00:00:41,056 --> 00:00:42,656
At times like this, the only way is

16
00:00:42,656 --> 00:00:44,456
to go directly to the store and get in line.

17
00:00:47,556 --> 00:00:50,029
Sonoko, don't tell me that that's...

18
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:54,033
2 arena seat tickets to the Black Roses Tokyo Live.

19
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:56,035
I had a tough time trying to get them, you know.

20
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:57,056
It's gone!

21
00:00:58,356 --> 00:01:00,056
I'm sure I put it in here.

22
00:01:00,056 --> 00:01:03,056
Who is it? That stole my ticket?

23
00:01:08,356 --> 00:01:10,656
Wrong! I got this ticket.

24
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,656
Thief!

25
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:30,069
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

26
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:32,071
are slashed by the light of deduction.

27
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:33,656
An incident occurs at a coffee shop.

28
00:01:33,656 --> 00:01:35,356
Beware of rare tickets!

29
00:01:35,356 --> 00:01:37,056
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:39,056
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:41,756
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:11,196 --> 00:03:16,996
"The Platinum Ticket Commotion"

33
00:03:17,396 --> 00:03:18,696
"The next day"

34
00:03:18,696 --> 00:03:21,296
I was taken to the police box on the corner after that

35
00:03:21,296 --> 00:03:24,596
and until my innocence was proven, it took 3 hours! 3 hours!

36
00:03:26,996 --> 00:03:31,496
But she have a note of her seat number on the ticket?

37
00:03:31,496 --> 00:03:35,096
But she said it was one that her boyfriend got hold of from a friend,

38
00:03:35,096 --> 00:03:36,996
so she had no record of it at all.

39
00:03:36,996 --> 00:03:38,696
I tell you, really, it's so infuriating!

40
00:03:38,696 --> 00:03:42,201
I got in line and stood overnight from Saturday.

41
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:44,203
Excuse me.

42
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:47,096
I would like an XL size cafe latte,

43
00:03:47,096 --> 00:03:49,896
with an addition of vanilla ice cream and caramel syrup to go with it,

44
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,896
and chocolate chip topping with just a little ice.

45
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:56,215
An X large size cafe latte with vanilla ice cream,

46
00:03:56,396 --> 00:03:59,196
caramel syrup and chocolate chip topping to go with it.

47
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:00,996
And you just want a little ice.

48
00:04:00,996 --> 00:04:04,496
Hey, Sonoko. Hold it down a bit, girl.

49
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:10,229
It's okay. It's on the house today,

50
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:11,296
so order to your heart's content.

51
00:04:13,196 --> 00:04:15,096
Welcome.

52
00:04:17,196 --> 00:04:19,496
Conan, it's her.

53
00:04:19,496 --> 00:04:23,496
The one who called us thief yesterday, Haruka Kona.

54
00:04:25,396 --> 00:04:28,247
Excuse me. We're sorry about yesterday.

55
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:31,496
Please take a look at this!

56
00:04:33,096 --> 00:04:35,796
Last night after this shop had closed,

57
00:04:35,796 --> 00:04:37,896
this ticket for the live was put on auction

58
00:04:37,896 --> 00:04:40,259
from an internet auction site!

59
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:42,796
No joke! 50,000 yen per ticket?

60
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:45,896
The price sky-rocketed to 5 times the original in one night!

61
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:47,496
Not only the price,

62
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,696
but also the handle name of the exhibitor.

63
00:04:49,696 --> 00:04:51,596
Coffee Rumba?

64
00:04:51,596 --> 00:04:54,273
It sure sounds like a name

65
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:56,275
that a coffee shop employee would use, don't you think?

66
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,896
Don't tell me that one of our employees is the culprit?

67
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:02,281
Aren't you just kind of picking a fight?

68
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:04,283
At any rate, I'd like to talk to the people

69
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:07,696
who were at this shop last night.

70
00:05:07,696 --> 00:05:09,896
The people who were at the shop last night

71
00:05:09,896 --> 00:05:14,293
were me and Kosuda who was passing out cake freebies,

72
00:05:14,496 --> 00:05:18,297
and the cashier, Masako Moka.

73
00:05:19,496 --> 00:05:21,896
Please call her over here, too!

74
00:05:24,296 --> 00:05:27,296
The fact is, she's hasn't shown up yet today.

75
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:35,696
No good.

76
00:05:35,696 --> 00:05:38,317
She's not answering no matter how many times I call.

77
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:41,096
It seems that she hasn't attended her university classes either.

78
00:05:41,096 --> 00:05:42,696
Maybe something came up?

79
00:05:42,696 --> 00:05:45,496
Is she your friend?

80
00:05:45,496 --> 00:05:48,327
Yes, we're classmates at the university.

81
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:52,331
She was supposed to work the shift after me today.

82
00:05:52,496 --> 00:05:56,335
True. She should've been here some time ago, already.

83
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:59,296
Shall I go check on her on my way home?

84
00:05:59,296 --> 00:06:01,596
-Will you do that? -Yes, sir.

85
00:06:01,596 --> 00:06:03,896
Wait. If so, I'll go with you too.

86
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,096
We'll tag along with you too, then.

87
00:06:06,096 --> 00:06:08,347
-Right? -Yeah.

88
00:06:17,496 --> 00:06:19,396
Masako.

89
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:22,361
Masako. Aren't you home?

90
00:06:25,196 --> 00:06:26,996
It's open.

91
00:06:29,796 --> 00:06:31,096
Masako?

92
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,385
Conan!

93
00:06:48,796 --> 00:06:51,796
No good. She's already dead.

94
00:06:51,796 --> 00:06:54,796
Ran, call the police, please.

95
00:06:54,796 --> 00:06:56,395
Okay!

96
00:07:11,396 --> 00:07:12,696
This is...

97
00:07:12,696 --> 00:07:14,196
an auction site.

98
00:07:14,196 --> 00:07:16,415
Which means that it was her after all.

99
00:07:21,196 --> 00:07:22,796
Manager!

100
00:07:22,796 --> 00:07:24,896
What's the meaning of this?

101
00:07:24,896 --> 00:07:26,996
You are?

102
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:28,796
I'm the store manager of the coffee shop

103
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:32,996
that Ms. Moka works for, Jiro Kirima.

104
00:07:32,996 --> 00:07:34,433
I see.

105
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:38,196
Please tell me what Ms. Moka was doing last night.

106
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:41,296
Yes, sir. Ms. Moka was working the late shift

107
00:07:41,296 --> 00:07:44,443
and they worked together until 21:00.

108
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:47,596
After quickly cleaning the shop,

109
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:49,896
we changed and left the shop.

110
00:07:49,896 --> 00:07:52,451
I think at around 21:15.

111
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:56,455
It takes about 30 minutes from the shop to here,

112
00:07:56,696 --> 00:08:00,459
so she probably got home at around 21:45.

113
00:08:00,696 --> 00:08:02,461
And 30 minutes later,

114
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:06,096
the ticket was placed on the auction site.

115
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:09,296
Inspector. According to Mr. Uruma who lives next door,

116
00:08:09,296 --> 00:08:11,696
it seems that she was washing clothes

117
00:08:11,696 --> 00:08:13,296
between 22:20 to 23:00 last night.

118
00:08:13,296 --> 00:08:16,096
What?

119
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,996
Does she always wash clothes at that time of day?

120
00:08:18,996 --> 00:08:22,481
Yeah. She vacuums her room late at night

121
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:24,483
as well as bring her boyfriend around, too.

122
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:26,496
She delays paying the rent a lot, too.

123
00:08:26,496 --> 00:08:28,896
She was a sloppy woman.

124
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:30,496
I see.

125
00:08:30,496 --> 00:08:31,996
If she had 40 minutes,

126
00:08:31,996 --> 00:08:34,493
she would've finished washing clothes, no?

127
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:36,495
May I take a look?

128
00:08:36,696 --> 00:08:38,296
No, Conan.

129
00:08:38,296 --> 00:08:40,796
You shouldn't look in on women's clothes.

130
00:08:40,796 --> 00:08:42,296
Okay.

131
00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:48,096
Inspector, the wash is still in here after being wrung.

132
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:52,996
Moreover, from the fact that the bag was near the corpse on the floor,

133
00:08:52,996 --> 00:08:55,696
it seems that the victim was planning to go out somewhere

134
00:08:55,696 --> 00:08:57,696
while the washing machine was still running.

135
00:08:57,696 --> 00:08:59,596
That's when she ran into the thief

136
00:08:59,596 --> 00:09:02,996
that broke into her place was killed.

137
00:09:02,996 --> 00:09:05,996
-But, isn't that strange? -Huh?

138
00:09:05,996 --> 00:09:08,096
Because if the washing machine is running,

139
00:09:08,096 --> 00:09:11,596
wouldn't it be natural to think that somebody's home?

140
00:09:11,596 --> 00:09:14,533
I see. That's true.

141
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:17,796
I'm sure that after running the washing machine,

142
00:09:17,796 --> 00:09:21,396
she was planning to go to a convenience store nearby and left.

143
00:09:21,396 --> 00:09:23,496
But she realized right away that she had forgotten something

144
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:24,996
and came home.

145
00:09:24,996 --> 00:09:27,496
That's where she ran into the culprit.

146
00:09:31,396 --> 00:09:33,396
But, what did she forget?

147
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:35,296
Most probably the deposit slip

148
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:37,896
to pay for her gas bill that was on the table.

149
00:09:39,396 --> 00:09:42,561
The payment deadline is last night.

150
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:45,496
It could be just as Conan had said.

151
00:09:45,496 --> 00:09:46,565
Yes.

152
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:49,296
The culprit, after murdering the victim

153
00:09:49,296 --> 00:09:51,496
pulled the bills out of the wallet,

154
00:09:51,496 --> 00:09:54,596
took the ticket and fled.

155
00:09:54,596 --> 00:09:59,396
So, the culprit knew that the ticket was premium?

156
00:09:59,396 --> 00:10:03,096
Which means that you may have been in danger too, Sonoko.

157
00:10:03,096 --> 00:10:04,996
But if I were the thief,

158
00:10:04,996 --> 00:10:08,096
I would go for the laptop first of all.

159
00:10:10,096 --> 00:10:12,996
And more so, Pops was saying

160
00:10:12,996 --> 00:10:16,396
that professional thieves, in order to work effectively,

161
00:10:16,396 --> 00:10:20,096
would open drawers in order from the bottom up.

162
00:10:20,096 --> 00:10:23,096
But these drawers aren't opened that way.

163
00:10:23,096 --> 00:10:24,603
Then, it's also likely that

164
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:27,496
the culprit tried to make it look like the work of a thief?

165
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,996
First of all, let's start by

166
00:10:30,996 --> 00:10:32,611
checking on the acquaintances of the victim, shall we?

167
00:10:32,796 --> 00:10:35,296
What? Ms. Moka's boyfriend?

168
00:10:35,296 --> 00:10:38,617
Yes. Do you remember what kind of man he was?

169
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:43,596
The thing is, I've never met him personally.

170
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:47,796
Store manager.

171
00:10:47,796 --> 00:10:51,796
I think it's better for you to tell the police the truth.

172
00:10:51,796 --> 00:10:55,096
What the? What should I tell them, sonny?

173
00:10:55,096 --> 00:10:58,896
You were the one going with the lady who died, right?

174
00:11:00,096 --> 00:11:03,496
Because on your cell phone, you had her name registered

175
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,096
not by her full name, but as "Masa-chan."

176
00:11:08,896 --> 00:11:11,696
Besides even on the shift chart back at the shop,

177
00:11:11,696 --> 00:11:14,653
both of you had days off on the same days, right?

178
00:11:16,096 --> 00:11:18,196
I saw it.

179
00:11:18,196 --> 00:11:20,659
Is what he just said true?

180
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:26,196
To be honest, I've been going with her since two months ago.

181
00:11:26,196 --> 00:11:29,596
You have a spare key, don't you?

182
00:11:29,596 --> 00:11:31,896
Yes.

183
00:11:31,896 --> 00:11:35,896
I see. If you have the spare key,

184
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:38,677
it would've been easy for you to enter the room

185
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:40,996
after confirming that she had gone out, wouldn't it?

186
00:11:40,996 --> 00:11:42,696
No.

187
00:11:42,696 --> 00:11:46,696
Then, please tell me what you were doing last night.

188
00:11:46,696 --> 00:11:49,996
Yesterday, after closing the shop,

189
00:11:49,996 --> 00:11:52,296
I was placing orders for stationeries and odds and ends

190
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:54,693
to be used at the shop, then left,

191
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:57,496
so it must've been around a little before 22:00.

192
00:11:57,496 --> 00:11:59,596
It's true that if they were going with each other,

193
00:11:59,596 --> 00:12:02,701
they could've easily gotten into a fight over emotional differences.

194
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:07,496
Besides, Masako was trying to resell a customer's ticket.

195
00:12:08,096 --> 00:12:09,796
It's highly probable that she got into a fight

196
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:13,196
with Mr. Kirima who is the store manager.

197
00:12:13,196 --> 00:12:16,715
But what is it? Something just doesn't feel right.

198
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:23,296
And where and what were you doing between 22:20 and 23:00?

199
00:12:23,296 --> 00:12:25,496
I see.

200
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:30,396
Sir. How come you remember so accurately

201
00:12:30,396 --> 00:12:33,596
the time that the washing machine was running?

202
00:12:33,596 --> 00:12:36,735
It was rattling and making a lot of noise.

203
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,396
After about 5 minutes it stopped once,

204
00:12:39,396 --> 00:12:42,196
so I thought the owner heard the noise and...

205
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:44,743
-It stopped once? -Yeah.

206
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:46,196
But after a while,

207
00:12:46,196 --> 00:12:48,496
it started spinning making that loud noise again,

208
00:12:48,496 --> 00:12:50,196
that's why I remember.

209
00:12:55,596 --> 00:12:58,757
I see. That was the cause of the noise.

210
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:01,896
But, why was only that?

211
00:13:05,696 --> 00:13:07,196
This is...

212
00:13:09,796 --> 00:13:12,771
I get it! So, that's the story!

213
00:13:18,451 --> 00:13:20,779
I get it! So, that's the story!

214
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:26,251
Gosh. The minute we take our eyes off of you, it's this.

215
00:13:26,251 --> 00:13:27,651
Sonoko.

216
00:13:27,651 --> 00:13:30,451
You're too young to be looking in on women's clothes yet!

217
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:34,451
I've got to tell Ran to educate you correctly!

218
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:42,801
Sonoko.

219
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:44,151
Sonoko?

220
00:13:44,151 --> 00:13:46,805
How annoying. We know who the culprit is,

221
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:49,451
so why don't we get right to it and solve the case?

222
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:51,251
-What? -What?

223
00:13:51,251 --> 00:13:54,451
The victim started washing clothes last night,

224
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:58,451
but didn't get around to taking out the laundry from the washing machine.

225
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:00,151
So, we can assume that the incident happened

226
00:14:00,151 --> 00:14:02,051
during the time that the washing machine was running

227
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:06,451
which was between 22:20 to 23:00.

228
00:14:06,451 --> 00:14:09,251
But after scrutinizing this washing machine,

229
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:11,551
there's something queer about it.

230
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,351
Something queer?

231
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:16,835
Officer Sato, please turn the faucet on.

232
00:14:20,451 --> 00:14:22,251
The faucet is shut off.

233
00:14:22,251 --> 00:14:25,851
Exactly. The laundry hasn't been taken out

234
00:14:25,851 --> 00:14:28,551
and yet the faucet is shut off.

235
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:31,351
In other words, couldn't it be that someone stopped the water

236
00:14:31,351 --> 00:14:32,851
and drained the washing machine

237
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:35,851
in order to take something out of it?

238
00:14:35,851 --> 00:14:37,851
What's that something?

239
00:14:37,851 --> 00:14:41,651
Of course, the ticket for the Black Roses live.

240
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:44,851
But, why would it be in the washing machine?

241
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,551
Because the culprit was sure that

242
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:48,867
it would be in the pocket of the apron

243
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:51,651
that Masako took home from the shop.

244
00:14:51,651 --> 00:14:52,871
The culprit last night,

245
00:14:53,051 --> 00:14:55,951
put the ticket that she stole from Haruka

246
00:14:55,951 --> 00:14:59,151
into her own apron pocket.

247
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:00,879
But, after closing time,

248
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:05,851
Masako mistakenly took that apron home thinking it was hers.

249
00:15:07,151 --> 00:15:11,151
That's why the culprit came to this room

250
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:14,551
to retrieve that ticket she had stolen.

251
00:15:14,551 --> 00:15:15,751
Wait a minute!

252
00:15:15,751 --> 00:15:18,897
It's just as if you're saying that I'm the culprit!

253
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:22,051
But, aren't you? Ms. Kaori Kosuda?

254
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:27,751
You, who approached the apartment last night,

255
00:15:27,751 --> 00:15:30,909
saw Masako throw the apron from the shop

256
00:15:31,151 --> 00:15:34,151
into the washing machine and run it.

257
00:15:34,151 --> 00:15:36,351
You were at a loss what to do.

258
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:38,917
She eventually went shopping

259
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:41,251
while the washing machine was running.

260
00:15:41,251 --> 00:15:43,451
You then stopped the water

261
00:15:43,451 --> 00:15:46,451
and was about to take out your own apron,

262
00:15:46,451 --> 00:15:49,651
but Masako who had forgotten something

263
00:15:49,651 --> 00:15:52,651
came back right away.

264
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,933
After murdering Masako,

265
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:56,951
in order to make it look as if a thief had broken in,

266
00:15:56,951 --> 00:15:58,451
you messed the room up.

267
00:15:58,451 --> 00:16:01,851
Then, in order to feign that the entire washing process had ended,

268
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:04,943
you set the washing machine to spin dry and left.

269
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:06,945
Enough is enough!

270
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:09,951
Who's going to believe something so ridiculous?

271
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:14,351
But you seem to have forgotten to open the faucet that you shut off.

272
00:16:15,451 --> 00:16:16,951
Everything you're saying

273
00:16:16,951 --> 00:16:18,751
is all a product of your imagination.

274
00:16:18,751 --> 00:16:20,951
Where on earth is the evidence?

275
00:16:20,951 --> 00:16:22,961
I've got proof.

276
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:25,251
It's the apron that you have with you!

277
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,651
Apron?

278
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:28,951
I get it. If it's just as Sonoko said

279
00:16:28,951 --> 00:16:32,971
and Masako brought home Kaori's apron,

280
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:35,451
the apron that Kaori has right now

281
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:39,351
is indeed actually Masako's apron, right?

282
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:41,251
I see.

283
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:46,451
You would recognize my apron, wouldn't you, Manager?

284
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:51,751
-Please confirm. -Yes.

285
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,993
Can you tell?

286
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:57,851
This is Ms. Kosuda's apron.

287
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,999
She just started working for us from last month,

288
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:03,551
so her apron is still new.

289
00:17:03,551 --> 00:17:05,351
So, now you know.

290
00:17:05,351 --> 00:17:07,551
I'm not the culprit!

291
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:10,151
Your deduction is wrong.

292
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:14,151
Mr. Uruma.

293
00:17:14,151 --> 00:17:16,051
It seems that the washing machine last night

294
00:17:16,051 --> 00:17:18,551
was especially noisy, wasn't it?

295
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:23,851
Yeah. Something hard must've been inside.

296
00:17:23,851 --> 00:17:28,351
Officer Sato, please take a look inside the washing machine.

297
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:30,351
Okay.

298
00:17:30,351 --> 00:17:32,451
So this is the apron in question.

299
00:17:35,251 --> 00:17:37,951
What's up?

300
00:17:37,951 --> 00:17:39,851
There's a red marker inside.

301
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,039
What?

302
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,351
Right, a red marker.

303
00:17:43,351 --> 00:17:45,043
It's a miscellaneous item of the shop

304
00:17:45,251 --> 00:17:48,651
that's used to write in special orders.

305
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,851
The shirt and towel that have been washed are pink

306
00:17:51,851 --> 00:17:53,451
because although they were originally white,

307
00:17:53,451 --> 00:17:56,251
they were dyed by the ink of the red marker.

308
00:17:56,251 --> 00:18:00,251
By the way, there's a dark smear on the pocket of the pants,

309
00:18:00,251 --> 00:18:05,551
so it must've inadvertently been thrown into the washing machine.

310
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:08,151
True.

311
00:18:08,151 --> 00:18:09,451
Inspector Megure.

312
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:13,451
Will you please take a look at Kaori's apron once again?

313
00:18:13,451 --> 00:18:14,751
Okay.

314
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:16,851
If my deduction is correct,

315
00:18:16,851 --> 00:18:21,079
I'm sure that apron is also dyed pink.

316
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:25,083
Too bad. The apron of Marine Coffee is black.

317
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,085
It couldn't be dyed with a red marker.

318
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:28,851
-It's dyed. -Huh?

319
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:31,951
The washing instructions tab is dyed pink!

320
00:18:34,551 --> 00:18:36,051
Kaori.

321
00:18:36,051 --> 00:18:37,651
After committing the murder,

322
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:39,451
in order to leave no trace behind,

323
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,351
you took your own apron out of the washing machine,

324
00:18:42,351 --> 00:18:45,103
and put Masako's apron inside it in place of yours.

325
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:48,551
Then you spun dried it with the other laundry.

326
00:18:48,551 --> 00:18:51,109
That's why the washing instructions tab of the apron

327
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:54,251
that is inside the washing machine is white as it was originally.

328
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:58,251
And your apron's washing instructions tab is dyed pink.

329
00:19:00,751 --> 00:19:02,451
No.

330
00:19:05,551 --> 00:19:08,551
Ms. Kosuda. Why did you...

331
00:19:08,551 --> 00:19:13,131
That's because the ticket was originally what Kaori had bought.

332
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:16,251
Just what're you talking about?

333
00:19:16,251 --> 00:19:18,151
It's what my boyfriend...

334
00:19:18,151 --> 00:19:20,451
According to the shift chart that we saw a while ago at the shop,

335
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:24,051
last Sunday when most of the employees were working,

336
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:27,551
only Kaori had taken a day off.

337
00:19:27,551 --> 00:19:29,451
You took a day off

338
00:19:29,451 --> 00:19:33,151
to get in line overnight at the ticket shop, didn't you?

339
00:19:33,351 --> 00:19:35,951
You did?

340
00:19:35,951 --> 00:19:40,351
I just wanted to make my boyfriend happy.

341
00:19:40,351 --> 00:19:44,751
To see him smiling on his birthday, the day of the live...

342
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:46,551
Your boyfriend?

343
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:48,251
Don't tell me...

344
00:19:48,251 --> 00:19:50,151
He's a guitarist,

345
00:19:50,151 --> 00:19:53,171
although he's nameless.

346
00:19:53,351 --> 00:19:57,651
But he told me that he couldn't go because of work that day.

347
00:19:57,651 --> 00:20:01,179
So, that he was going to give the ticket

348
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:03,751
to an acquaintance at a record company.

349
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:08,151
A person at a record company? Me?

350
00:20:08,151 --> 00:20:10,851
I realized it, just yesterday.

351
00:20:10,851 --> 00:20:13,191
When you came to the shop.

352
00:20:13,351 --> 00:20:15,951
What? You mean that nameless guitarist?

353
00:20:15,951 --> 00:20:19,551
Yep. The day is his birthday, you see!

354
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,851
And he says he wants me to celebrate it with him.

355
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:23,951
I didn't think that he would...

356
00:20:23,951 --> 00:20:25,203
After thinking about it,

357
00:20:25,451 --> 00:20:28,651
I just couldn't not do anything about it.

358
00:20:28,651 --> 00:20:30,351
On second thought,

359
00:20:30,351 --> 00:20:33,211
Masako was watching all that.

360
00:20:33,951 --> 00:20:37,751
Yes. It's all just as you've deduced.

361
00:20:37,751 --> 00:20:43,951
After Masako left, I came here to retrieve the apron.

362
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,225
But Masako saw me.

363
00:20:48,951 --> 00:20:50,951
You really surprised me, though.

364
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:52,051
To think that somebody as well-behaved as you

365
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,151
would steal something from a customer.

366
00:20:54,151 --> 00:20:56,251
It's about time you wake up, don't you think?

367
00:20:56,251 --> 00:21:00,051
You're just being used as a handy money-giving girlfriend!

368
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:01,239
No!

369
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:04,951
That guy doesn't give a hoot about you!

370
00:21:04,951 --> 00:21:08,851
Wrong! He told me that he loved me!

371
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,351
That he loved me.

372
00:21:10,351 --> 00:21:12,251
He loved me...

373
00:21:13,551 --> 00:21:15,651
Masako.

374
00:21:19,451 --> 00:21:23,251
When I snapped back to myself, I suddenly got scared.

375
00:21:23,251 --> 00:21:24,451
That's why...

376
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:28,451
You tried to make it look to be the doing of a thief?

377
00:21:28,451 --> 00:21:31,051
But at the point, you tried to hide your crime

378
00:21:31,051 --> 00:21:33,271
and fabricated the site,

379
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:37,275
you turned into an even more ill-natured,

380
00:21:37,451 --> 00:21:40,251
cowardly liar than the guy who deceived you.

381
00:23:12,451 --> 00:23:14,051
But the worst of them all

382
00:23:14,051 --> 00:23:16,751
is the guitarist that deceived the two, right?

383
00:23:16,751 --> 00:23:18,751
You can say that again.

384
00:23:18,751 --> 00:23:21,379
I don't remember a thing, though.

385
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:24,651
If I were her, I would blast him with a punch.

386
00:23:29,551 --> 00:23:33,391
Two-timing men are the pits!

387
00:23:41,751 --> 00:23:44,351
Well, I guess he asked for it.

388
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,340
Next Conan's Hint:

389
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,520
"Stuffed Doll"

390
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,588
The next episode will take place in Kumamoto.

391
00:23:52,588 --> 00:23:53,980
Raw horse meat and spicy lotus root.

392
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,413
They say it's going to be a mystery tour.
