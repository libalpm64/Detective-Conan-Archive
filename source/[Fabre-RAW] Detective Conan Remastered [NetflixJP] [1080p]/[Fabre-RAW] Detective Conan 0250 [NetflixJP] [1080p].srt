1
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,480
Reasons and hints are all connected.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,230
With these, the truth unravels.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,230
The love was misunderstood.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,110
Today's case makes everything clear!

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,940
Seeing the one and only truth...

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,570
A kid with the intellect of an adult...

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,780
His name is... Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,740
Okino Yoko-san invited us to a party.

9
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,290
Okino Yoko (22)
Idol

10
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,250
She was a member of the idol group, the Earth Ladies.
Okino Yoko (22)
Idol

11
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,620
She was a member of the idol group, the Earth Ladies.

12
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,080
Kaoru Kusano (20)
Actress

13
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,920
It turned out to be Kusano Kaoru-san's engagement party.
Kaoru Kusano (20)
Actress

14
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,040
It turned out to be Kusano Kaoru-san's engagement party.

15
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,590
The other members of the Earth Ladies,

16
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,090
Yuki Takeno (22)
Multi-talented

17
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,010
Takeno Yuki-san,
Yuki Takeno (22)
Multi-talented

18
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,550
Yuki Takeno (22)
Multi-talented

19
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,140
Hoshino Terumi (23)
Actress

20
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,050
and Hoshino Terumi-san also showed up.
Hoshino Terumi (23)
Actress

21
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,350
Hoshino Terumi (23)
Actress

22
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,310
However, when Kaoru-san was taking a bath...

23
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,520
she was attacked!

24
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,030
(Part Two)
The Idol Stars' Secret

25
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,040
Shouldn't you be searching for the most important thing?

26
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,830
The murder weapon...

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,040
The dagger that slashed Kaoru's throat.

28
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,300
If you find it in this apartment or among our possessions,

29
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,050
then the murderer is one of us.

30
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,600
I don't think an outsider would leave the
murder weapon inside the apartment.

31
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:10,900
Even if it was wiped clean, there would still be traces
of blood that forensics would find with luminol.

32
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,190
It's not something that one can easily hide, right?

33
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,450
Yes.

34
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,790
You sure do know a lot.

35
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,210
I'm into mysteries these days, because of someone.

36
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:37,090
Okay. Takagi, you search Kenzaki-san while
the policewomen search the ladies.

37
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,180
The rest of you, carefully search for the murder weapon!

38
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:48,140
But Inspector, if the culprit is Makuma-san, then
he could've disposed of the weapon by now.

39
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,900
That would be bad.

40
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,020
Don't worry.

41
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,650
I asked the people in the ambulance to call
me if he tried to do anything strange.

42
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,070
I see.

43
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,540
Takeno-san, if you don't mind stepping in now.

44
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,750
Right away.

45
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:12,210
Hey, wasn't Yuki-san a regular on
the show "Detective Samonji"?

46
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,630
Yeah, she was the annoying journalist
who kept following Samonji.

47
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,590
However, when she sent in her resignation
in order to take care of her sick father,

48
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,970
she was replaced by Kaoru, although
Terumi was their first choice.

49
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:28,980
Terumi would've gotten the role if it hadn't been for
Makuma-san's begging. That's why Kaoru got the part.

50
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,940
But Kaoru-san described Makuma-san as a depressing man.

51
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,490
Makuma-san wanted to be a star as well.

52
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,240
He was in the same studio as us, but he
gave up and became Kaoru's manager.

53
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:52,330
But even though Kaoru speaks about him like that, the
truth is that she cares a lot about Makuma-san.

54
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,210
She always said that he lacked resolve,
and that he gave up too quickly.

55
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,300
I see.

56
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,180
So you weren't able to find the murder weapon...

57
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,640
That's right. It's neither in this apartment, nor in any drains.

58
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,560
Did you also check their accessories?

59
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,810
Yeah.

60
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:20,820
Yuki-san's fake nails, Terumi-san's earrings,
and even Kenzaki-san's necklace.

61
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
But they all turned up negative on the luminol test.

62
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,910
And what about Makuma-san?

63
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:33,040
I heard that they even tested his
glasses, but they found nothing.

64
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:41,550
And until the detectives arrived, he was
sitting in a chair with his head down.

65
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:47,850
Then was the murder weapon really
taken outside by the criminal?

66
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,230
It seems likely that the criminal came
from outside the apartment.

67
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,310
No, you're wrong.

68
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,480
If they didn't know that Kaoru-san was in the bathroom,

69
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:04,280
then suddenly walking into the apartment and
committing the murder is not possible.

70
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,870
But if the murderer is someone from inside, then
the murder weapon must be somewhere.

71
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,910
Why can't we find it?

72
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,330
Inspector!

73
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,550
We found a listening device in this doll.
It must be from one of her fans.

74
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,250
What?

75
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,010
It also seems that her drawers have been tampered with.

76
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,470
That means that if someone had been spying on Kaoru-san,

77
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:35,480
he would have known about her engagement
and her location in the bathroom.

78
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:43,940
So, if the person was one of her biggest fans, he could have
attacked her and taken something as a gift for himself.

79
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,740
Contact her studio immediately and ask them if there are
any dangerous fans out there that we should be aware of.

80
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,830
Understood.

81
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,670
This is her room.

82
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,800
These must be the drawers that man was talking about.

83
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,430
The drawers containing pens and scissors are messy.

84
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,310
The ones containing makeup and jewelry
haven't even been touched.

85
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,820
This picture!

86
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:25,110
You!

87
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,450
Don't.

88
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,910
You shouldn't be invading someone's privacy.

89
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,870
I'm really sorry.

90
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:38,120
Women have things that they don't
want others to know about.

91
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,000
For that reason, they do some stupid things.

92
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,510
That picture, please put it back where you found it.

93
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,600
If it's no longer there, Kaoru could get extremely upset.

94
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,690
Alright, I'll put it back.

95
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,280
I see!

96
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,780
So that's why!

97
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,620
I've got it. I know what weapon the murderer used!

98
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,910
Not to mention,

99
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,830
how they got rid of it!

100
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,830
In any case,

101
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,420
the murder weapon isn't in this room.

102
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,340
That means this was an outside job.

103
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,140
There's a chance it was one of her angry fans.

104
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:39,890
Right now, all we can do is hope that she recovers
fast in order to help solve this mystery.

105
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,730
She might have seen the culprit.

106
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,160
H-Hello?

107
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,630
Yes, I'm Kaoru's friend.

108
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,460
Yes.

109
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,470
Huh? Kaoru...

110
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,180
Yoko...

111
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,010
What happened? It's the hospital, right?

112
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,390
Don't tell me that Kaoru is...

113
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,230
Don't worry. The surgery went fine!

114
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,190
She'll wake up in a couple of hours.

115
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,980
Oh, really?!

116
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,940
Thank goodness!

117
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:36,700
Then, you should be there when Kaoru-san
wakes up, since you're her fiance.

118
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,830
Yeah.

119
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,410
But are you sure that's okay?

120
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,540
The hospital is swamped with reporters
who have heard about the incident.

121
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,000
I could always go later.

122
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:53,380
I don't wanna annoy the patients or mislead the reporters.

123
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,640
Mislead them?

124
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,810
So it's over.

125
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,680
You have to tell everyone the truth
about the engagement party now.

126
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,730
The truth?

127
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,690
Uh... well...

128
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,730
T-The thing is...

129
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,760
It's unfortunate, isn't it?

130
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,060
Your plan didn't work out.

131
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,980
You're the one that did it, right? The criminal
that drugged Kaoru-san and slit her throat.

132
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,150
Boy...

133
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,940
While you're smart enough to be a detective,

134
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,910
you can't find the murder weapon.

135
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,540
The tool that was used to cut her
throat is nowhere to be found.

136
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,540
And I certainly don't have a knife on me.

137
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,670
If I'm really the criminal, then can you tell
me where I hid the murder weapon?

138
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,090
I don't know where it is, but I know what it looks like.

139
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,930
It's a sharp tool stuck on your finger.

140
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,310
Oh, you mean these fake nails?

141
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,810
Unfortunately, the police have already checked them, and—

142
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,320
No. Those nails are for camouflage only.

143
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,780
The truth is that the weapon is hidden
underneath those fake nails.

144
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:42,080
The next hardest thing in the human body after the
teeth, and a weapon only a woman could use:

145
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,750
That's her real, edge-sharp nails.

146
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:56,510
My guess is that you used your strong right thumb nail.

147
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,010
Before using it, you covered it up with a fake nail.

148
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,890
Afterwards, you clipped your nail
until it reached normal size.

149
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,690
Finally, you covered it up again.

150
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,190
No one would notice that the real
nail was as long as the fake one.

151
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,900
That's why you used old gloves.

152
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:26,830
You put a hole in them so that the nail could pass through.
You even used a raincoat to avoid the splattered blood.

153
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:37,050
And finally, you intentionally threw the coat and gloves
outside so it would appear that the culprit ran outside.

154
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,760
Effectively making it seem like the
crime was committed by a stalker.

155
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:48,140
You even sent the letters and the doll to Kaoru-san.

156
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,600
Isn't that right, Yuki-san?

157
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,520
I'm sorry.

158
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,820
So, the murder weapon was a real nail.

159
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:07,410
If that's true, then there must be a nail clipper
with traces of Kaoru's blood, right?

160
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:13,710
Your plan was to find one of Kaoru-san's in her room.

161
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,960
You needed it to hide the weapon.

162
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,800
However, you weren't able to find one among her stationary.

163
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:28,310
Maybe Kaoru-san uses a nail file instead of a nail clipper.

164
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,270
If it was me, I'd use scissors to cut my nail.

165
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:38,650
You would never use scissors because the police would
check them as a potential murder weapon.

166
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,360
If blood was found on them, this case would easily be solved.

167
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,660
A nail clipper would never be tested because
it can't be used to cut someone's throat.

168
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:53,830
You couldn't bring your own nail clipper
with you, it would be too suspicious.

169
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:00,380
You knew that all of the suspects' belongings
would be checked, including yours.

170
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,180
But, you said yourself that I couldn't have used a nail clipper!

171
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,760
How do you think I cut my nail?

172
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,730
Didn't I just tell you? There is something stronger
than the nails in the human body.

173
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,520
The teeth.

174
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:22,690
You clipped your nails by biting them,
then threw them down the drain.

175
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:30,200
As a result, it wouldn't look threatening enough to be
considered a weapon, and would be overlooked.

176
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,120
But I have proof that you did it.

177
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,960
Here, look at your kiss mark on this card.

178
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,880
It isn't very obvious, but you can see where it's darker.

179
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:51,850
That's Kaoru-san's blood on your lips,
left from when you bit off your nail.

180
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,230
Even without your deduction, Kaoru
could've told you the truth.

181
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,530
I called her from outside the bathroom,

182
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,450
and drugged her when she came out.

183
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,450
Could she have...

184
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,960
Could she have taken something before I followed her here?

185
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:27,430
I fell in love with Kenzaki-kun the
first day we performed together.

186
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,520
But, Kaoru stole him <i>and</i> my role from me.

187
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,520
No, you don't understand!

188
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,650
And when I congratulated her, you know what she told me?

189
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:51,490
It's all made up. It's just a rumor started by the press.

190
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,620
I was shocked, but before I knew what happened,

191
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,710
I was engulfed in a frenzy of jealousy
that I never felt before.

192
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,040
The real reason...

193
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,760
the reason Kenzaki-san and Kaoru-san never got engaged...

194
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,050
Most likely...

195
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,800
I'm so stupid.

196
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,970
I could have killed her if I had cut deeper.

197
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,100
When I saw her face, I just froze... I knew I couldn't kill her.

198
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,560
She really was...

199
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,940
my friend...

200
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,280
I'm t-truly glad that... that she didn't die.

201
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,870
What? What did she take?

202
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,120
Her face is pale and blue...

203
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,790
Her hand is shaking and her pulse is rapid...

204
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,040
Also, she just fainted...

205
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:49,220
My father is in the hospital for diabetes.

206
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:50,010
Maybe, it could be... the diabetes medication!

207
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,680
Blood Sugar Medication
Maybe, it could be... the diabetes medication!

208
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:52,930
Blood Sugar Medication

209
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,720
Diabetics are usually prescribed a
medicine that lowers blood sugar.

210
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,600
It can be deadly if it's abused.

211
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,390
If a normal person took the drug, their
blood sugar would drop drastically.

212
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,940
If I leave her like this, she'll die!

213
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,280
Yuki-san must have prepared it ahead of time.

214
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:10,360
There!

215
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,870
Dammit, I won't let her die!

216
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,120
Not because of this senseless delusion!

217
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,620
I won't let her die!

218
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,540
Kaoru...

219
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,250
I'm sorry, Kaoru...

220
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,800
I'm really sorry.

221
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,590
Kaoru...

222
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,970
K-Kaoru?

223
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,430
She woke up!

224
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,020
Where am I?

225
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,400
Haido Hospital.

226
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,900
You were unconscious for two whole days.

227
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,980
You really are silly.

228
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,860
How could you mistake your father's
medicine for your vitamins?

229
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,830
I'll go tell Terumi that you're awake.

230
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,800
Kaoru, I...

231
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:12,630
I'm...

232
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,550
Don't worry. I told the police everything.

233
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,010
I told them that someone attacked me.

234
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,640
I told them it was an old fat lady!

235
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,600
I said, I told them it was an old woman.

236
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,070
I didn't want them thinking that some
psycho stalker was after me.

237
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,320
But, it was me...

238
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:38,120
Well, I should thank you for giving me this wound.

239
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,370
It's my punishment for lying for so long
without considering your feelings.

240
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,120
Lying?

241
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:49,840
Yes, the engagement party was fake.
I asked Kenzaki-san to play along.

242
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,630
I was trying to make a certain someone jealous.

243
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,760
Haven't I told you this before?

244
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,430
I want to marry in my 20s, just like Kudo Yukiko!

245
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:01,510
Yeah.

246
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,640
And now, my dream has come true.

247
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,110
It's front page now!

248
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,650
He finally proposed.

249
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,360
What? You still like that weakling?

250
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,990
Hey, watch it!

251
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,080
I know he seems like a chicken, but he's a marvelous man.

252
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,910
You should hear what he said in front of the reporters...

253
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,580
I don't want to lose that someone that I treasure the most.

254
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,590
So, a lot has happened today...

255
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:44,890
But thanks to Terumi, the plan was
able to work out pretty well.

256
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,310
Huh? Terumi was in on it?

257
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:52,020
We never actually had a fight.

258
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:58,240
When the Earth Ladies were still together, Terumi
used to visit me and give me a lot of advice.

259
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:06,250
We made up that fight as the reason our group was
breaking up. Sorry we never told you about it.

260
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,500
I see. You made up the fight so it would
be easier for us to break up.

261
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,720
But, what was the "Sorry to hear about it" on the card for?

262
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:25,850
Oh, that boy said she probably meant that
she was sorry the plan didn't work out.

263
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,600
That boy?

264
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:32,360
Conan-kun! Apparently, Detective
Mouri has trained him well.

265
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:40,990
He saw Kenzaki-san trying to cover me up with
a towel before getting me out of the bathtub.

266
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,450
That's how he knew we weren't really engaged.

267
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:52,880
He saw a picture of me with Makuma-kun, but
Terumi's attitude is what made him suspicious.

268
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,290
So, he kept asking me questions.

269
00:20:55,090 --> 00:21:01,930
He's the one who fed you all that sugar when
he saw you passed out on the floor.

270
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:03,970
I see...

271
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,560
He saved me...

272
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:14,440
So, what about Kenzaki-san? Hurry up and tell him
how you feel before Terumi beats you to it!

273
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,860
Why?

274
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:25,070
Conan-kun said Terumi likes mysteries, and that she
must like the man who plays Detective Samonji.

275
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,250
Unfortunately, he's mistaken.

276
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,580
Kenzaki-kun told Terumi how he feels about
her but was completely ignored.

277
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,050
Huh? Then who's the person that she likes?

278
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,220
Who knows, but she usually likes younger guys.

279
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,930
Okay!

280
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,810
Scene 7, Terumi forces her opponent to surrender.

281
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:21,940
As usual, you have to act like a cool, heartless woman.

282
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,730
Okay.

283
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,990
Alright.

284
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:34,080
Haven't you noticed?

285
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:39,790
You made a fatal mistake that will bring about your defeat.

286
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,510
Your pieces look as though they have
a strong formation, but they don't.

287
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,340
She's more of a detective than a Shogi player.
Your pieces look as though they have
a strong formation, but they don't.

288
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,130
She's more of a detective than a Shogi player.

289
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:56,180
The move you made with your bishop was your downfall.

290
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:57,850
That is true.

291
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,610
Impossible.

292
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,880
Next Conan's Hint:

293
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,100
"Horseshoe"

294
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,360
Next is horse!

295
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:09,400
Did someone call me?
Next is horse!

296
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,920
Did someone call me?
