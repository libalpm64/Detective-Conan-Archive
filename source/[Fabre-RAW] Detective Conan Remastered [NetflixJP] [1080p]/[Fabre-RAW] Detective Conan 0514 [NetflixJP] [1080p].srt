1
00:00:02,867 --> 00:00:04,267
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:04,267 --> 00:00:05,567
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:05,567 --> 00:00:07,667
And start the countdown to deduction and love.

4
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:09,567
Coffee cups and cake tell of the truth of the case.

5
00:00:09,567 --> 00:00:11,567
The real killer and sad truth.

6
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:13,167
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,167 --> 00:00:14,867
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,867 --> 00:00:16,867
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,454 --> 00:02:00,654
A program called "24-Hour Close Up of Kogoro Mouri"

10
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,654
is scheduled to be produced.

11
00:02:02,654 --> 00:02:05,354
"Maiko Kusumi (29)" -Along with Mr. Shogo Somei,

12
00:02:05,354 --> 00:02:09,154
"Shogo Somei (35)" -the president of the program production company,

13
00:02:09,154 --> 00:02:10,754
"Raisaku Nakame (52)" -we headed off to the house

14
00:02:10,754 --> 00:02:14,113
of Tohto TV's producer, Mr. Raisaku Nakame.

15
00:02:14,113 --> 00:02:17,054
However, when we got there, the front door was locked,

16
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,254
and no one answered the door bell.

17
00:02:21,354 --> 00:02:23,554
After hearing from President Somei

18
00:02:23,554 --> 00:02:25,854
that Mr. Nakame had been contemplating suicide,

19
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,854
we called the condo manager and made it into the room.

20
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:31,854
Mr. Nakame!

21
00:02:31,854 --> 00:02:35,054
In the room, we found the body of Mr. Nakame,

22
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:37,154
who had drunk poisoned coffee lying dead on the floor.

23
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:42,141
The spilled coffee on top the table

24
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:43,854
indicated traces of deception.

25
00:02:43,854 --> 00:02:47,154
The possibility of it being a murder increased.

26
00:02:47,154 --> 00:02:50,149
Moreover, the coffee that had spilled on the floor indicated

27
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:52,151
that someone was in the room

28
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:54,754
with Mr. Nakame at the time of his death.

29
00:02:54,754 --> 00:02:57,254
The mystery of the case grew deeper.

30
00:02:57,254 --> 00:03:03,254
How did that person get out of this room that had a locked front door?

31
00:03:03,254 --> 00:03:07,254
And who is the one that poisoned Mr. Nakame to death?

32
00:03:09,754 --> 00:03:13,154
"Intent to Kill is the Aroma of Coffee (Part 2)".

33
00:03:15,254 --> 00:03:16,454
It means

34
00:03:16,454 --> 00:03:20,654
that the killer may still be hiding somewhere in this room.

35
00:03:20,654 --> 00:03:22,554
Check every nook and cranny.

36
00:03:22,554 --> 00:03:23,754
Yes, sir...

37
00:03:23,754 --> 00:03:25,954
Takagi, hold it.

38
00:03:25,954 --> 00:03:26,954
Yes?

39
00:03:26,954 --> 00:03:31,054
President Somei could be the one who schemed this trick

40
00:03:31,054 --> 00:03:35,854
and went into the room first to hide the traces of his trick.

41
00:03:35,854 --> 00:03:37,654
Go and check

42
00:03:37,654 --> 00:03:40,554
if he's really on sick leave from his company.

43
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,754
Yes, sir.

44
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:45,554
"Somei Productions" -Huh? How is President Somei feeling?

45
00:03:45,554 --> 00:03:46,954
Well.

46
00:03:46,954 --> 00:03:49,154
It seems he hasn't been feeling too well the past two or three days.

47
00:03:49,154 --> 00:03:51,654
He wasn't at work today either.

48
00:03:51,654 --> 00:03:53,354
Is that right?

49
00:03:53,354 --> 00:03:55,154
Did he mention

50
00:03:55,154 --> 00:03:57,954
which part of his body isn't feeling well?

51
00:03:57,954 --> 00:03:59,754
No, it's not anything like that.

52
00:03:59,754 --> 00:04:01,854
I think it has something to do with work.

53
00:04:01,854 --> 00:04:03,554
Work-related?

54
00:04:03,554 --> 00:04:06,554
I think it's because the special he was planning on went down the drain.

55
00:04:06,554 --> 00:04:08,654
What? A special program?

56
00:04:08,654 --> 00:04:11,954
Do you mean the one that Detective Mouri was going to be featured?

57
00:04:11,954 --> 00:04:14,554
Oh, so you know about it.

58
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:18,254
Yes, it's that "24 Hour Close Up of Kogoro Mouri" program.

59
00:04:18,254 --> 00:04:21,854
What about the meeting that was supposed to take place with Mr. Nakame?

60
00:04:21,854 --> 00:04:23,254
It was cancelled as well.

61
00:04:23,254 --> 00:04:26,654
The president said he'd personally apologize to Mr. Mouri,

62
00:04:26,654 --> 00:04:28,754
but I wonder if he really did.

63
00:04:28,754 --> 00:04:32,054
Well, that isn't what's important now.

64
00:04:32,054 --> 00:04:33,354
Oh, yes. That's right.

65
00:04:33,354 --> 00:04:34,654
Speaking of the president,

66
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:38,254
I saw him today around sundown at a pharmacy nearby.

67
00:04:38,254 --> 00:04:40,654
What time was that?

68
00:04:40,654 --> 00:04:42,261
I think it was around 6.30 pm.

69
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:44,263
6.30 pm?

70
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:46,054
6.30 pm...

71
00:04:46,054 --> 00:04:49,054
If that's true, it's a perfect alibi

72
00:04:49,054 --> 00:04:53,054
because the company is quite some distance from here.

73
00:04:53,054 --> 00:04:57,054
I wonder why he didn't even mention it.

74
00:04:59,854 --> 00:05:02,954
Yes, Mr. Somei came at around 6.30 pm

75
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:04,954
to buy stomach medicine.

76
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:08,287
But why would the police want to know something like that?

77
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:09,354
Well, you see.

78
00:05:09,354 --> 00:05:13,354
Mr. Somei inadvertently got himself into a certain incident.

79
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:17,254
Do you mean the one that has to do with that famed Detective Kogoro Mouri?

80
00:05:17,254 --> 00:05:19,254
While he was here, he answered a call,

81
00:05:19,254 --> 00:05:22,754
and I heard Mr. Somei saying, "Detective Mouri".

82
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:24,054
Well...

83
00:05:24,054 --> 00:05:30,054
Wait. He got another call before that one.

84
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:32,311
Do you know who it was from?

85
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:35,154
I'm sure that it was a woman.

86
00:05:35,154 --> 00:05:36,315
A woman?

87
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:38,754
He called her Maiko.

88
00:05:38,754 --> 00:05:41,354
-Maiko? -Maiko?

89
00:05:42,754 --> 00:05:44,323
It's the woman who came to the detective office

90
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:46,854
with Mr. Somei the other day.

91
00:05:48,854 --> 00:05:52,354
She called Mr. Somei at that time.

92
00:05:57,054 --> 00:05:58,337
This is...

93
00:05:59,554 --> 00:06:00,954
Could it be...

94
00:06:04,554 --> 00:06:08,654
The reason why President Somei rushed into this room first was because...

95
00:06:08,654 --> 00:06:10,854
His real intention was...

96
00:06:17,654 --> 00:06:19,554
The aroma of coffee.

97
00:06:19,554 --> 00:06:21,154
Just as I thought.

98
00:06:21,154 --> 00:06:23,354
No one's here after all.

99
00:06:23,354 --> 00:06:26,354
Was that window locked?

100
00:06:26,354 --> 00:06:29,354
Yeah. Just to be sure,

101
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:31,454
we checked the veranda after opening the window.

102
00:06:31,454 --> 00:06:33,254
Don't you open the window

103
00:06:33,254 --> 00:06:35,054
because it's raining pretty heavily.

104
00:06:39,254 --> 00:06:41,854
The window was closed,

105
00:06:41,854 --> 00:06:45,654
but the lace curtain is wet.

106
00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:46,854
Come to think of it,

107
00:06:46,854 --> 00:06:49,354
when President Somei came to this condo,

108
00:06:49,354 --> 00:06:51,654
his jacket was wet.

109
00:06:51,654 --> 00:06:54,393
So, how was the veranda?

110
00:06:55,354 --> 00:06:57,054
Could someone have gone to the room next door

111
00:06:57,054 --> 00:06:59,054
or gone down from there?

112
00:06:59,054 --> 00:07:00,399
No, no way.

113
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,654
The veranda's blocked off by a wall from the room next door,

114
00:07:03,654 --> 00:07:05,954
and there is no trace that the emergency escape ladder

115
00:07:05,954 --> 00:07:08,407
was used to get down to the veranda below.

116
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:10,409
Besides, we're on the 20th floor.

117
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:13,654
It may be a parking lot right below here,

118
00:07:13,654 --> 00:07:15,754
but if someone were to use a rope and try to make it down,

119
00:07:15,754 --> 00:07:19,554
I'm sure that someone is bound to notice.

120
00:07:19,554 --> 00:07:23,754
Well, I guess you could use a hand glider to fly like Thief Kid,

121
00:07:23,754 --> 00:07:26,754
but it would be quite difficult in the rain.

122
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:30,754
If so, there's only one answer.

123
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:34,754
The one and only sad truth.

124
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:45,054
May I be excused to leave?

125
00:07:45,054 --> 00:07:46,454
It's getting pretty late

126
00:07:46,454 --> 00:07:49,154
and I'm starting to feel unwell again.

127
00:07:49,154 --> 00:07:52,154
No. Please wait a while longer.

128
00:07:52,154 --> 00:07:55,254
Hey, did you confirm whether he really is unwell or not?

129
00:07:55,254 --> 00:07:58,954
Yes, I called President Somei's company

130
00:07:58,954 --> 00:08:00,459
and found out that he's having stomach trouble.

131
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:04,154
He also took leave for two to three days.

132
00:08:04,154 --> 00:08:07,254
I was also told that an employee saw him

133
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:10,954
at a neighborhood drugstore today at sundown around 6.30.

134
00:08:10,954 --> 00:08:12,754
About 6.30 pm?

135
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:14,954
That's the estimated time of death of the body.

136
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:18,054
Yes. I also called the drugstore,

137
00:08:18,054 --> 00:08:22,054
and confirmed he was buying stomach medicine there at the time.

138
00:08:22,054 --> 00:08:24,483
Which means he has an alibi?

139
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:29,254
Yes. And that program "24 Hour Close Up of Kogoro Mouri"

140
00:08:29,254 --> 00:08:31,154
has already been cancelled.

141
00:08:31,154 --> 00:08:32,754
So, I can't figure out

142
00:08:32,754 --> 00:08:35,454
why he took Mr. Mouri over to Mr. Nakame's residence

143
00:08:35,454 --> 00:08:38,497
to have the meeting as scheduled without saying a word about it.

144
00:08:39,454 --> 00:08:41,754
I guess he did come to hide

145
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:44,854
traces of a locked room murder trick.

146
00:08:44,854 --> 00:08:48,507
If so, we've got to figure out the trick first.

147
00:08:50,254 --> 00:08:51,854
In cases like these,

148
00:08:51,854 --> 00:08:55,454
if things go as they usually do, Mouri would come up with something.

149
00:08:55,454 --> 00:08:56,854
He would make strange sounds like "Hinyo" or the like.

150
00:08:56,854 --> 00:08:58,517
That's right.

151
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:01,354
Well, comments that Conan makes out of the blue

152
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:04,154
lead to hints on solving the case at times too.

153
00:09:04,154 --> 00:09:06,525
Why?

154
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:08,054
Why not?

155
00:09:08,054 --> 00:09:09,754
I said no, so it's a no.

156
00:09:09,754 --> 00:09:11,454
Stop saying strange things, will you?

157
00:09:11,454 --> 00:09:13,154
What is it he should stop saying?

158
00:09:13,154 --> 00:09:15,754
Is it something important to do with the case?

159
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:18,537
No. He said that he's hungry

160
00:09:18,754 --> 00:09:23,154
and wants to eat that cake that's on the table.

161
00:09:23,154 --> 00:09:26,545
Because nobody's eating that cake, right?

162
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:28,554
Then, why can't I eat it?

163
00:09:28,554 --> 00:09:30,549
Well, you see, Conan.

164
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:32,551
The cake is an important evidence,

165
00:09:32,754 --> 00:09:34,553
and we've still got a lot of examining to do.

166
00:09:34,553 --> 00:09:35,954
No way.

167
00:09:35,954 --> 00:09:39,754
I'll bet you're planning to eat it later with Inspector Megure.

168
00:09:39,754 --> 00:09:42,054
No, no. We won't do such a thing.

169
00:09:42,054 --> 00:09:45,554
Anyway, there's just enough for two.

170
00:09:45,554 --> 00:09:47,354
-What? Just enough for two? -What? Just enough for two?

171
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,854
See, take a good look at that cake.

172
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:52,571
It's sliced in the middle.

173
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:57,454
-It's true! -But why?

174
00:09:57,454 --> 00:09:59,554
-This means... -Maybe...

175
00:09:59,554 --> 00:10:02,581
someone suddenly felt like eating more cake?

176
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:05,454
The rest of the whole cake was in the refrigerator,

177
00:10:05,454 --> 00:10:08,587
so it could be cut into any size they like.

178
00:10:08,754 --> 00:10:12,591
Oh, boy. When did Pops check out the refrigerator?

179
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:14,593
Ran does that a lot too.

180
00:10:14,754 --> 00:10:17,154
She buys extra cake saying that it's for our guests,

181
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:19,454
and ends up eating two servings by herself.

182
00:10:19,454 --> 00:10:22,601
That's why she's grown in all the wrong places.

183
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:25,354
What does that have to do with this case?

184
00:10:25,354 --> 00:10:27,354
Speaking of growth,

185
00:10:27,354 --> 00:10:30,609
if you give coffee to a tree, will it help the tree grow?

186
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:32,354
Giving coffee to a tree?

187
00:10:32,354 --> 00:10:34,613
What nonsense are you talking about?

188
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:38,617
But I smell coffee from that plant over there.

189
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:41,954
Let me see.

190
00:10:43,254 --> 00:10:44,623
He's right.

191
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:47,954
Maybe it does help the tree grow.

192
00:10:50,354 --> 00:10:53,354
This pencil holder smells of coffee too.

193
00:10:53,354 --> 00:10:58,254
That man called Mr. Nakame must've really liked coffee.

194
00:11:04,854 --> 00:11:06,154
I get it!

195
00:11:06,154 --> 00:11:10,649
Maybe the placement of the coffee cup and the cake on the table

196
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:12,454
wasn't like this initially.

197
00:11:13,554 --> 00:11:15,054
But rather...

198
00:11:32,454 --> 00:11:34,673
What do you think about this?

199
00:11:37,554 --> 00:11:39,454
It increased to a serving for two people.

200
00:11:39,454 --> 00:11:41,854
I see.

201
00:11:41,854 --> 00:11:44,454
You move the cake to one plate,

202
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:47,454
then place the plate that is emptied under the coffee cup,

203
00:11:47,454 --> 00:11:49,554
making it look like a saucer.

204
00:11:49,554 --> 00:11:52,954
You pour your own coffee into the planter,

205
00:11:52,954 --> 00:11:55,654
then put writing tools into the other coffee cup

206
00:11:55,654 --> 00:11:58,354
to make it look like a pencil holder, completing the deception trick.

207
00:11:58,354 --> 00:12:00,699
This was done to make it look as if no one was here with Mr. Nakame

208
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:04,703
when he drank the poisoned coffee.

209
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:07,054
But who would do something like this?

210
00:12:07,054 --> 00:12:08,707
The killer.

211
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:13,054
It was to make it look as if Mr. Nakame had committed suicide.

212
00:12:13,054 --> 00:12:15,954
So who is that killer?

213
00:12:15,954 --> 00:12:17,454
Well...

214
00:12:18,954 --> 00:12:20,354
That's...

215
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:28,727
Something's strange.

216
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:32,138
Why are you making that sound again?

217
00:12:32,138 --> 00:12:34,038
Come on, it's the third time today.

218
00:12:34,038 --> 00:12:38,737
But there are some things missing on the table.

219
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:40,038
What?

220
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:43,638
There are two pieces of cake, two plates and two coffee cups.

221
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,038
Nothing's missing.

222
00:12:45,038 --> 00:12:46,745
It's the fork.

223
00:12:46,938 --> 00:12:50,438
One fork that is needed to eat the cake is missing.

224
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,751
You're right.

225
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:55,138
The fork for the plate that was used as a saucer isn't here.

226
00:12:55,138 --> 00:12:57,638
That means it's somewhere in this room.

227
00:12:57,638 --> 00:12:58,757
Like in the kitchen?

228
00:12:58,938 --> 00:13:02,761
No. If the killer had time to hide it into the the kitchen cabinet,

229
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:06,765
the coffee cups would've been brought to the sink too.

230
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:10,769
I didn't have time, so I hid it in my pocket.

231
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:14,338
If I didn't shout as soon as I saw Mr. Nakame's dead body,

232
00:13:14,338 --> 00:13:18,138
I would be suspected, right?

233
00:13:18,138 --> 00:13:20,779
Does that mean you killed Mr. Nakame?

234
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:22,038
Yes.

235
00:13:22,038 --> 00:13:26,238
After all, he did give me a pretty bad time, work-wise.

236
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,638
I killed him just as you had mentioned, inspector.

237
00:13:29,638 --> 00:13:31,738
I came here with the cake,

238
00:13:31,738 --> 00:13:34,038
put poison into coffee,

239
00:13:34,038 --> 00:13:36,795
then told him I had urgent business to attend to and left.

240
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:39,338
I warned him to chain lock the door for safety reasons

241
00:13:39,338 --> 00:13:40,799
before leaving.

242
00:13:41,038 --> 00:13:44,138
Back then, I was bothered about my portion of cake and coffee cup

243
00:13:44,138 --> 00:13:47,538
that I left on the table.

244
00:13:47,538 --> 00:13:50,809
So I told Mr. Nakame I'd put them away before leaving.

245
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:54,238
But he told me to hurry and go if it was urgent.

246
00:13:54,238 --> 00:13:56,815
That he would clean up the place.

247
00:13:56,815 --> 00:14:00,138
So I came back to this room with Mr. Mouri

248
00:14:00,138 --> 00:14:02,438
to hide the coffee cup and cake.

249
00:14:02,438 --> 00:14:05,238
I guess it was useless after all.

250
00:14:05,238 --> 00:14:08,438
But there are eye-witness reports of you being at a drugstore

251
00:14:08,438 --> 00:14:12,038
in your neighborhood at around 6.30 pm.

252
00:14:12,038 --> 00:14:13,138
Who saw me?

253
00:14:13,138 --> 00:14:16,838
An employee of your company and the sales clerk at the drugstore.

254
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:21,338
It's true that I went to buy medicine today,

255
00:14:21,338 --> 00:14:22,841
but that was a little after 5.00 pm.

256
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:25,238
I'm sure they got the time wrong.

257
00:14:25,238 --> 00:14:28,638
Then, what about the coffee stain?

258
00:14:28,638 --> 00:14:32,038
Judging from the way the coffee spilled on the floor and stained it,

259
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:37,738
it happened when someone was sitting on the chair.

260
00:14:37,738 --> 00:14:41,938
Well, I spilled the coffee deliberately.

261
00:14:41,938 --> 00:14:44,138
Deliberately?

262
00:14:44,138 --> 00:14:46,438
When I came into this room with Mr. Mouri,

263
00:14:46,438 --> 00:14:50,338
I spilled the coffee deliberately before pouring it into the planter.

264
00:14:50,338 --> 00:14:53,738
Doing so would make this look like an impossible crime, wouldn't it?

265
00:14:55,038 --> 00:14:58,877
But when I touched the stain right after Conan told me to do so,

266
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:00,538
it wasn't wet at all.

267
00:15:00,538 --> 00:15:02,881
Do you remember when you touched it?

268
00:15:02,881 --> 00:15:04,883
No, I don't remember the time.

269
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:08,438
But I'm sure it was 30 to 40 minutes after we received the call.

270
00:15:08,438 --> 00:15:10,889
You're not really sure, are you?

271
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:13,638
It probably dried up because some time had passed.

272
00:15:13,638 --> 00:15:16,538
Besides, if I wasn't the one who stained the floor,

273
00:15:16,538 --> 00:15:18,638
who else could've done it?

274
00:15:18,638 --> 00:15:21,738
How did that person lock the door up

275
00:15:21,738 --> 00:15:23,738
and where did that person disappear to?

276
00:15:23,738 --> 00:15:26,138
Yes. The person disappeared

277
00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:28,038
to the world beyond.

278
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:32,911
What do you mean by the world beyond?

279
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:36,238
Oh, well. That's what I'd like to know...

280
00:15:42,038 --> 00:15:43,538
Dad, don't tell me that...

281
00:15:43,538 --> 00:15:44,923
It's finally coming.

282
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:48,927
Yes. The mystery that everyone wants to hear.

283
00:15:49,138 --> 00:15:52,338
How did the murderer make it out of this room

284
00:15:52,338 --> 00:15:54,238
and where did the killer disappear to?

285
00:15:54,238 --> 00:15:56,638
The answer is the world beyond.

286
00:15:56,638 --> 00:16:01,838
The person fled to the underworld that is totally out of our reach.

287
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:04,938
Hey, I don't understand a word you're saying.

288
00:16:04,938 --> 00:16:06,138
Don't... don't tell me

289
00:16:06,138 --> 00:16:08,638
that Mr. Nakame schemed it himself before committing suicide.

290
00:16:08,638 --> 00:16:10,138
-What? -No.

291
00:16:10,138 --> 00:16:12,738
It's not Mr. Nakame's own doing.

292
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,953
Think about it.

293
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:17,638
The window of this room was closed.

294
00:16:17,638 --> 00:16:20,438
Why did the curtain still get wet?

295
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:23,338
And when we arrived at this condo,

296
00:16:23,338 --> 00:16:25,438
why was President Somei's clothes wet

297
00:16:25,438 --> 00:16:28,967
despite having been in the car all the while?

298
00:16:30,638 --> 00:16:33,438
At around 6.30, the estimated time the murder was committed,

299
00:16:33,438 --> 00:16:36,038
there was another person who called President Somei

300
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:38,738
besides me.

301
00:16:40,038 --> 00:16:43,938
And that killer is a person that President Somei wants to protect

302
00:16:43,938 --> 00:16:48,987
even if he himself were to be taken as the murderer.

303
00:16:48,987 --> 00:16:51,638
Wait, don't tell me that it's...

304
00:16:51,638 --> 00:16:56,138
Yes. The one who killed Mr. Nakame

305
00:16:56,138 --> 00:16:59,738
was an employee at President Somei's company,

306
00:16:59,738 --> 00:17:02,638
Ms. Maiko Kusumi.

307
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:15,838
She probably came here with the cake

308
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,017
and made Mr. Nakame drink poisoned coffee.

309
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:22,538
She made sure he was dead,

310
00:17:22,538 --> 00:17:26,438
then jumped out from the veranda and took her own life.

311
00:17:26,438 --> 00:17:28,138
It can't be...

312
00:17:28,138 --> 00:17:29,938
So, the call that Mr. Somei received on his phone

313
00:17:29,938 --> 00:17:33,031
at the time of the crime was from her.

314
00:17:33,238 --> 00:17:37,638
She probably called to tell him that she was going to commit suicide.

315
00:17:37,638 --> 00:17:39,738
She told President Somei,

316
00:17:39,738 --> 00:17:43,438
the person she cherished and trusted most about it.

317
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,043
That... That's not true!

318
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:47,045
She didn't do anything!

319
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:48,738
I schemed all of this on my own!

320
00:17:48,738 --> 00:17:50,538
-She did nothing! -You came here

321
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:53,538
so that she wouldn't be seen as a killer, right?

322
00:17:53,538 --> 00:17:56,338
You tried to make it look as if she was never here

323
00:17:56,338 --> 00:17:59,057
and that Mr. Nakame committed suicide, right?

324
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:00,338
In case the worst happened,

325
00:18:00,338 --> 00:18:02,838
you would set yourself up as the killer in her place.

326
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:06,638
So the curtain was wet

327
00:18:06,638 --> 00:18:10,538
because she left the window open after going out to the veranda.

328
00:18:10,538 --> 00:18:14,738
Yes, and President Somei's the one who closed it.

329
00:18:14,738 --> 00:18:16,638
He also shouted

330
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:19,938
to let me know that he found the corpse.

331
00:18:19,938 --> 00:18:22,538
Wrong, wrong! She didn't do it!

332
00:18:22,538 --> 00:18:25,083
I did it. I'm the one who did it!

333
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,638
Inspector, please arrest me!

334
00:18:27,638 --> 00:18:30,638
Don't you mind leaving her the way she is?

335
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:36,038
If you're arrested as is,

336
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:41,099
she's going to be left confined in this cold rain.

337
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:44,038
The wet body of Maiko

338
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:46,638
who jumped to her death

339
00:18:46,638 --> 00:18:49,107
from the 20th floor to the parking lot,

340
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:51,838
that you carried into the trunk of your car.

341
00:19:04,338 --> 00:19:05,738
Maiko...

342
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:10,738
Check the trunk of the car right now.

343
00:19:10,738 --> 00:19:11,938
Yes, sir.

344
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:35,153
Later, Maiko's body was found

345
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:37,638
inside President Somei's car trunk,

346
00:19:37,638 --> 00:19:42,038
and the mystery of this locked room murder case was solved.

347
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:46,138
According to the last phone call that Maiko had made to President Somei,

348
00:19:46,138 --> 00:19:49,838
after Producer Nakame's request for a commission was rejected,

349
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:51,838
the TV show was cancelled.

350
00:19:51,838 --> 00:19:54,838
He threatened that Somei wouldn't be able to work in industry anymore.

351
00:19:54,838 --> 00:19:55,938
Maiko couldn't bear watching Somei

352
00:19:55,938 --> 00:19:57,738
who was looking more and more haggard because of the threat,

353
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,177
thus committed the murder.

354
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:03,738
Hiding her intention to kill within her,

355
00:20:03,738 --> 00:20:04,738
she didn't tell President Somei

356
00:20:04,738 --> 00:20:09,938
that she had resigned from the company a day before committing the murder.

357
00:20:09,938 --> 00:20:12,238
However, just before taking the death plunge,

358
00:20:12,238 --> 00:20:16,738
she finally got to tell him how she really felt about him

359
00:20:17,938 --> 00:20:20,638
using her thin voice

360
00:20:20,638 --> 00:20:22,738
which was overshadowed by the sound of the rain.

361
00:22:38,238 --> 00:22:39,337
"The Following Day"

362
00:22:39,337 --> 00:22:40,638
What?

363
00:22:40,638 --> 00:22:43,338
Did you eat the cake that was in the refrigerator?

364
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,345
Yeah, I ate my portion.

365
00:22:47,345 --> 00:22:48,738
That's strange.

366
00:22:48,738 --> 00:22:50,938
While you were out, mum said she came

367
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:54,138
and put three pieces of cake that she bought inside the refrigerator.

368
00:22:54,138 --> 00:22:55,738
But there's only one piece left.

369
00:22:55,738 --> 00:22:59,357
Take a good look. There are two pieces, aren't there?

370
00:22:59,357 --> 00:23:01,738
You're right!

371
00:23:01,738 --> 00:23:04,938
Wait, this piece seems to have been cut into two.

372
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:09,938
The cellophane around the cake isn't wrapped too nicely either.

373
00:23:09,938 --> 00:23:11,938
It seems to have been rewrapped or something.

374
00:23:11,938 --> 00:23:13,938
Is... Is that so?

375
00:23:14,838 --> 00:23:17,375
There's whipped cream on the knife.

376
00:23:17,538 --> 00:23:18,738
You ate the cake, didn't you?

377
00:23:18,738 --> 00:23:20,738
You ate two pieces all by yourself.

378
00:23:20,738 --> 00:23:22,538
Watch it. That's a knife.

379
00:23:25,383 --> 00:23:27,385
Cake...

380
00:23:28,438 --> 00:23:31,389
You can have my portion, Ran.

381
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:33,391
I'm not hungry.

382
00:23:34,938 --> 00:23:37,395
Conan.

383
00:23:37,395 --> 00:23:39,738
Okay, I'll give mine to you too, dad.

384
00:23:39,738 --> 00:23:41,399
What? Really?

385
00:23:49,407 --> 00:23:52,338
I don't think I'll be eating cake for a while.

386
00:23:53,411 --> 00:23:57,415
Not until the rain stops, at least.

387
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,060
Next Conan's Hint:

388
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,234
"Black and white"

389
00:24:06,234 --> 00:24:08,234
Next week is a special! Thief Kid faces off against me!

390
00:24:08,234 --> 00:24:10,420
Ready! 1, 2, go!
