1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,170
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,070
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,970
An unexpected misunderstanding at a premier preview of a movie.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,770
The Youth Detective Squad stop the case before it happens!

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,170
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,670
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,870
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:16,889
The game is over!

9
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:18,789
You have no way out!

10
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:21,389
You're out! Dark Sashimu.

11
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:22,889
What are you saying...

12
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:25,589
Can you catch a big shock...

13
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:28,389
like me?

14
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:40,489
Don't think...

15
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:45,289
It's feels like water...

16
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:52,989
"Worldwide release on the 30th of October!"

17
00:02:54,089 --> 00:02:55,089
"Witness the legendary ending!"

18
00:02:55,089 --> 00:02:59,289
Witness this event of the century.

19
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:08,389
Talk about a long line.

20
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:09,889
It can't be helped.

21
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:14,189
It's the last of a popular movie that's been playing for 20 years.

22
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:16,189
But, we're sure were lucky

23
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:19,689
to be able to get a hold of the ticket of this preview.

24
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:22,089
You got it from Yoko Okino, didn't you?

25
00:03:22,089 --> 00:03:24,889
Yeah, be grateful to me.

26
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:26,989
Because I'm the one that had Pops ask Yoko Okino for it,

27
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:28,689
thinking that we had nothing to lose either way.

28
00:03:30,089 --> 00:03:31,589
Well...

29
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:33,389
I'm not done yet.

30
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:34,689
I'll show you

31
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:37,689
the power of the master swordsman of darkness.

32
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:39,089
Your powers

33
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:40,389
don't stand a chance

34
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:42,089
against this master swordsman of light, Bei-Ju.

35
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:45,689
I'll defeat you with the sword of the sun of the woman,

36
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:47,689
warrior of fire, Kisasa!

37
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:49,189
I won't lose.

38
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,489
-That's hurt! -I'll bet you guys don't feel a tinge of gratitude.

39
00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:01,189
"Preview of Karma and Friendship"

40
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:05,289
Hey, hey, come back here and stand in line!

41
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:08,089
Who cares, we've got tickets to go in, right?

42
00:04:08,089 --> 00:04:09,489
Even if we don't stand in line,

43
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:11,989
if the time comes we get to go inside, don't we?

44
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:14,589
But, as far as the seats, it's first come first serve,

45
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:17,589
so you won't get good seats if you don't stand in line like you should.

46
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,989
I guess so, but just thinking that I'm going to get to see it

47
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:21,789
before any of my other classmates...

48
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:23,389
It's so exciting.

49
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:25,489
It's hard to stay still.

50
00:04:25,489 --> 00:04:28,589
In that case, you have to dress up properly.

51
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:29,789
"Bungo Tatei"

52
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:31,889
As for Dark Sashimu's two sword style,

53
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:34,089
you've got to hold the long sword in your right hand

54
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:37,289
and the short sword in your left hand.

55
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:40,689
Moreover, Bei-Ju wears his eye patch over his left eye,

56
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:42,889
and Kisasa's sword of the sun is long

57
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:44,989
so you've got to stretch it out like this and use it.

58
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:47,989
Wow! This sword stretches!

59
00:04:47,989 --> 00:04:49,589
You're really knowledgeable, aren't you?

60
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:50,589
Yes.

61
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:54,089
The fact is, I have the items that these children have too.

62
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:55,489
This guy is a maniac.

63
00:04:55,489 --> 00:04:58,389
You like Star Blade too, don't you?

64
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:02,289
Yeah, I've been a great fan since I saw the first series

65
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:03,989
when I was about your age.

66
00:05:03,989 --> 00:05:07,089
Besides, I met my girlfriend for the first time

67
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:09,489
at the preview for this movie too.

68
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:11,889
She's not with you today?

69
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:14,689
No... well, you know...

70
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,989
Did you have a fight or something?

71
00:05:15,989 --> 00:05:19,789
Don't tell me you fought because you had only one ticket?

72
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:21,689
No, it's nothing like that.

73
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:25,189
My friend, Narukawa, who also likes Star Blade

74
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:29,789
kept bugging me to give him this ticket last night by phone but...

75
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:32,289
Hey, hey.

76
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:34,989
You've got to hang on nice and tight to your ticket.

77
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:37,189
It's an important ticket, you know.

78
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:38,589
Sorry, sorry.

79
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,789
It's only a while more till the doors will open.

80
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:42,389
-Please stand in one straight line! -It's the swordsman of darkness,

81
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:45,189
-Dark Takio! -Really!

82
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:48,489
Oh yeah, would you like me to take a picture of you with him?

83
00:05:48,489 --> 00:05:49,989
-Yes, please! -Yes, please!

84
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:52,989
Okay, smile.

85
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:56,389
Thank you, sir!

86
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,889
You're welcome.

87
00:05:57,889 --> 00:05:59,389
I'm sorry and thank you so much.

88
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:00,589
Oh, not at all.

89
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:02,289
By the way, I'm...

90
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:03,689
Here's my name card.

91
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:06,789
"Bungo Tatei, Freelance Photographer" -Mr. Bungo Tatei.

92
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:08,289
You're a camera man.

93
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:12,089
Yes, so I'll guarantee that the outcome of the picture will be good.

94
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:14,989
Would you like me to take a picture of you too, sir?

95
00:06:14,989 --> 00:06:16,589
Okay.

96
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:19,189
Then, I'll take the picture with that camera.

97
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:20,989
Okay, say cheese!

98
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:23,689
Thank you.

99
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:25,589
I will send you the picture,

100
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:27,689
so could you write your name and address in my pocketbook here?

101
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:29,389
Okay.

102
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,889
Let's see...

103
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:34,189
Huh?

104
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:36,989
Oh, did you finish writing?

105
00:06:36,989 --> 00:06:37,989
Oh, yeah.

106
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:41,189
Okay, I'll send it as soon as it's developed and printed.

107
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:44,689
To this address, right?

108
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:48,189
Of course, you don't have to pay me, so please don't worry.

109
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:52,289
But, I'm really looking forward to Dark Takio.

110
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:55,189
Yes! I wonder what he's going to do in this movie.

111
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:57,389
He's so strong. That is very exciting!

112
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:59,389
-Don't worry! -What?

113
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:03,789
I'm sure that Bei-Ju and Kisasa will beat Dark Takio up!

114
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:06,189
Evil never wins over good.

115
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:07,589
Huh?

116
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:10,789
The phone...

117
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:13,989
Yes, this is Tatei.

118
00:07:13,989 --> 00:07:16,189
Oh, Narukawa?

119
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:19,689
What? Come in front of the second Okuho Building now?

120
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,289
Yeah, okay.

121
00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:22,489
I'll be right over.

122
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:27,489
I'm sorry, could you keep my place for me?

123
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,389
I'll leave my things here so...

124
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:30,689
Okay, no problem.

125
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:32,489
I'll be right back.

126
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:34,489
Hey, mister.

127
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,489
Didn't that guy say something?

128
00:07:38,489 --> 00:07:39,889
What do you mean something?

129
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:41,889
Didn't he take money from you or something?

130
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:44,789
No, all he took was our picture.

131
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:48,589
He insisted to take a picture of us too just a while ago.

132
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:50,689
He was really a pain.

133
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:53,189
I thought he was a new type of swindler or something.

134
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:54,989
I guess not.

135
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:01,389
"Joji Narukawa" -Hey, Narukawa!

136
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:03,389
-Huh? -Thanks for waiting.

137
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:06,489
What was that call all about?

138
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:09,589
You're the one who told me to call when I got here, right?

139
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,489
I'm sorry. I misunderstood.

140
00:08:12,489 --> 00:08:14,589
If it's not something important, I'm going home!

141
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:17,089
I don't have that much time to waste either!

142
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:18,489
Don't worry.

143
00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:20,889
I'm sure you'll like it.

144
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:22,689
It's a present from the bottom of my heart...

145
00:08:24,989 --> 00:08:28,289
that I got for my best friend.

146
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:31,389
But, that man was saying something strange a while ago, wasn't he?

147
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:36,389
Yes. He said that Dark Takio would be defeated by Bei-Ju and Kisasa!

148
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:39,289
He also said that evil never wins over good.

149
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:44,189
Oh, but isn't it only natural that justice wins over evil?

150
00:08:44,189 --> 00:08:47,889
But, Dark Takio is on their side since the previous movie!

151
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:50,289
He went against Dark Sahimu!

152
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:53,189
When he took off his skull mask, he was really good looking,

153
00:08:53,189 --> 00:08:54,789
so I know he's a good guy!

154
00:08:55,289 --> 00:08:57,689
I wonder why that man said so.

155
00:08:57,689 --> 00:09:00,389
Maybe he's going to betray everybody again in this movie?

156
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:01,689
What?

157
00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:06,689
He probably didn't see the previous Star Blade V.

158
00:09:06,689 --> 00:09:09,989
Hey, don't look through other people's things.

159
00:09:09,989 --> 00:09:13,489
See, there are two tickets for the preview of this movie three years ago,

160
00:09:13,489 --> 00:09:15,989
unused in between the pages of his pocketbook.

161
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:21,189
Hey, the thing that's smeared on one side of the ticket...

162
00:09:21,189 --> 00:09:23,089
It's probably bloodstain.

163
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:25,289
Although it looks pretty old.

164
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:26,689
Blood?

165
00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:29,989
Don't tell me somebody had a bloody fight over those tickets?

166
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:31,189
What?

167
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:33,289
I don't know about that,

168
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:35,589
but I'm pretty sure that the owners of these two tickets are...

169
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:38,189
that man called Tatei that we saw a while ago

170
00:09:38,189 --> 00:09:40,289
and the woman in this picture.

171
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,989
There's no mistaking that.

172
00:09:42,989 --> 00:09:46,189
It looks like the picture was taken in a car.

173
00:09:46,189 --> 00:09:47,689
The date on the picture

174
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:50,089
is the same as the one on the ticket bought three years ago.

175
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,289
I wonder why he didn't go to the preview.

176
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:55,489
I wonder...

177
00:09:55,489 --> 00:09:56,989
The elevator?

178
00:09:56,989 --> 00:09:58,289
Yes.

179
00:09:58,289 --> 00:10:03,089
Go straight down that aisle and you'll see it on the left.

180
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:04,889
Thank you.

181
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:08,689
Hey, Narukawa! The elevator's on the left side of the aisle!

182
00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:12,689
Hey, it's not that hard to find, is it?

183
00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:15,789
Sorry, I'm really bad at directions.

184
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:18,489
"Film content" -Strange.

185
00:10:18,489 --> 00:10:19,989
Something's strange?

186
00:10:19,989 --> 00:10:22,589
It's just notes, isn't it?

187
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:25,089
Remember, that man called Tatei a while ago

188
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:28,389
ripped the page off his pocketbook

189
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:31,689
and put it inside his film case, didn't he?

190
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:34,089
When he did so, I first thought that he did that

191
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:37,189
so he wouldn't forget what he had taken,

192
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:39,589
but all the films are numbered

193
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:41,389
and the details of what are in the films

194
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:44,289
are written out in his pocketbook.

195
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:48,489
Besides, none of the other pages in his pocketbook are ripped off,

196
00:10:48,489 --> 00:10:52,689
and all the other films that are completed are all in his bag.

197
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:55,689
Why only that film is not?

198
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:03,389
Come on, hurry up and show me the present you got for me!

199
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:05,289
Hold your horses.

200
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,989
I'll give it to you soon.

201
00:11:07,989 --> 00:11:10,089
When we arrive at the right place.

202
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:14,289
Talking about film, there's something that's also bothering me.

203
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:15,289
What?

204
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:17,589
When I took a picture of him a while ago,

205
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:19,989
he rewound it right away.

206
00:11:19,989 --> 00:11:22,989
But there were still 15 more films left.

207
00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:25,489
Don't you think that's strange?

208
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:28,189
The film was taken out before it was all used up.

209
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:30,189
He deliberately ripped the page with Dr. Agasa's address on it

210
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,589
out of his pocketbook and put it away in his pocket.

211
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:35,889
The blood stained preview ticket of three years ago,

212
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:39,389
and a friend who is a fan of Star Blade called him...

213
00:11:42,989 --> 00:11:44,289
Don't tell me that he's...

214
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:46,389
Hey, Tatei!

215
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:48,089
Can we come in here without permission?

216
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,189
This is the roof.

217
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:51,589
Do you remember, Narukawa?

218
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:52,589
What?

219
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:55,089
It was a fine day like today

220
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:58,289
when we met her, Ami

221
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:01,689
at the preview of the movie, wasn't it?

222
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:03,889
I see! I got it!

223
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,489
That man is probably here on his job!

224
00:12:07,489 --> 00:12:09,989
So, in order to separate the film from his work photos,

225
00:12:09,989 --> 00:12:11,589
he took it out.

226
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:13,289
-Oh, come on... -What?

227
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:15,189
If he's here on the job,

228
00:12:15,189 --> 00:12:17,689
he wouldn't have to stand in line like this, would he?

229
00:12:17,689 --> 00:12:19,289
I guess so.

230
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:22,889
Maybe he has no intention...

231
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:27,689
of coming back here.

232
00:12:36,594 --> 00:12:38,094
What?

233
00:12:38,094 --> 00:12:40,294
Hey, hey, did you forget?

234
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:41,894
It happened only six years ago.

235
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,794
Of course I remember!

236
00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:45,294
You mean the first time we met Ami

237
00:12:45,294 --> 00:12:47,894
at the preview of Star Blade IV, right?

238
00:12:47,894 --> 00:12:52,394
We found her holding her ticket and lost,

239
00:12:52,394 --> 00:12:55,694
so we brought her here.

240
00:12:55,694 --> 00:12:59,294
To this same place six years ago, didn't we?

241
00:12:59,294 --> 00:13:03,394
And three years ago, it was this same place too.

242
00:13:03,394 --> 00:13:05,294
Hey, don't tell me...

243
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:09,194
you're angry about the accident that killed Ami three years ago?

244
00:13:09,194 --> 00:13:12,994
It's true that I was the one driving at that time,

245
00:13:12,994 --> 00:13:14,794
but the police said so too, didn't they?

246
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,694
That the truck that rammed us was to blame!

247
00:13:17,694 --> 00:13:22,194
That the driver doze off, ran the red light and crashed into us.

248
00:13:23,694 --> 00:13:25,294
Darn.

249
00:13:25,294 --> 00:13:27,494
It's true that back then I overslept

250
00:13:27,494 --> 00:13:28,994
and was a bit flustered myself too,

251
00:13:28,994 --> 00:13:32,394
but I wasn't speeding or anything like that.

252
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:36,294
Besides, why are you bringing such an old topic out

253
00:13:36,294 --> 00:13:38,194
at a place like this?

254
00:13:38,194 --> 00:13:39,694
What?

255
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,694
I'll give you a present from me to you.

256
00:13:44,794 --> 00:13:47,794
This is the ticket to the preview of Star Blade?

257
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:49,794
You called and asked

258
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:51,994
if I had any extra tickets, right?

259
00:13:51,994 --> 00:13:54,694
But, you said you didn't have any left last night.

260
00:13:54,694 --> 00:13:55,694
I got urgent business to attend to suddenly

261
00:13:55,694 --> 00:13:57,294
so I ended up not being able to go.

262
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:00,494
That's why I called you this morning.

263
00:14:00,494 --> 00:14:02,494
Besides, I thought that if I gave it to you here,

264
00:14:02,494 --> 00:14:05,794
it would also make Ami happy.

265
00:14:05,794 --> 00:14:10,894
Remember? The accident happened right below here, didn't it?

266
00:14:10,894 --> 00:14:13,994
Yeah, right.

267
00:14:13,994 --> 00:14:15,294
Since that accident,

268
00:14:15,294 --> 00:14:17,494
we haven't been comfortable with each other,

269
00:14:17,494 --> 00:14:19,794
so this is a token of me making up with you.

270
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:25,794
Hey, hey, they'll be opening the doors in five minutes!

271
00:14:25,794 --> 00:14:26,794
What?

272
00:14:26,794 --> 00:14:27,894
If you don't hurry,

273
00:14:27,894 --> 00:14:30,094
you won't make it in time for the event to be held before the movie.

274
00:14:30,094 --> 00:14:31,594
No joke?

275
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:33,594
Okay, thanks Tatei!

276
00:14:33,594 --> 00:14:36,594
Yeah. Go and watch the movie closely for me too!

277
00:14:36,594 --> 00:14:40,494
Okay! I'll go watch really closely the actions of Dark Takio,

278
00:14:40,494 --> 00:14:42,794
your favorite character!

279
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:44,694
Although I'm pretty sure Bei-Ju and Kisasa

280
00:14:44,694 --> 00:14:46,694
are going to beat him up.

281
00:14:46,694 --> 00:14:47,794
Yeah.

282
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:49,994
I'll treat you to something some other time in exchange for this ticket!

283
00:14:49,994 --> 00:14:51,094
Yeah.

284
00:15:00,594 --> 00:15:01,794
Ami.

285
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:08,394
I'm sorry to have left you all alone three years ago.

286
00:15:15,794 --> 00:15:17,694
Hang on.

287
00:15:17,694 --> 00:15:21,394
I'll head over to where you are from now.

288
00:15:24,194 --> 00:15:25,394
No use.

289
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,894
Even if you jump off from there now...

290
00:15:30,894 --> 00:15:33,594
It'll only look like any other suicide.

291
00:15:34,994 --> 00:15:38,094
Because I'll testify that

292
00:15:38,094 --> 00:15:41,894
I saw you jump over the fence by yourself!

293
00:15:41,894 --> 00:15:46,394
You're the boy that was standing in line for the pre-screening.

294
00:15:46,394 --> 00:15:48,694
You seem to be misunderstanding something,

295
00:15:48,694 --> 00:15:51,194
I was leaning over just to see the landscape.

296
00:15:51,194 --> 00:15:53,694
The scenario you wrote goes like this...

297
00:15:54,994 --> 00:15:59,994
First, you randomly chose somebody who was standing in line.

298
00:15:59,994 --> 00:16:02,894
Befriend them by telling that you're a great Star Blade fan.

299
00:16:02,894 --> 00:16:05,994
Then, you take pictures with that person.

300
00:16:07,494 --> 00:16:09,594
Saying that you'd send the picture you took,

301
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:13,094
you'd have them write their name and address into your pocketbook.

302
00:16:13,094 --> 00:16:14,494
You rip off the page

303
00:16:14,494 --> 00:16:17,194
and put it inside the film case and put it into your pocket.

304
00:16:17,194 --> 00:16:20,394
You probably then told your friend to call you when he arrives

305
00:16:20,394 --> 00:16:22,894
and lured him out here.

306
00:16:22,894 --> 00:16:24,494
When your friend calls you,

307
00:16:24,494 --> 00:16:26,794
you shout his name as well as where he is,

308
00:16:26,794 --> 00:16:29,494
and make the people that you have befriended remember both.

309
00:16:30,594 --> 00:16:34,694
Then you leave the line, saying that you'd be right back,

310
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:37,394
meet your friend and take him to this roof,

311
00:16:37,394 --> 00:16:38,694
then all you had to do was to give your friend the ticket

312
00:16:38,694 --> 00:16:40,294
and jump from this roof.

313
00:16:40,294 --> 00:16:46,094
Since we were chosen by you to become friends with you,

314
00:16:46,094 --> 00:16:48,294
if you die and our picture, name and address

315
00:16:48,294 --> 00:16:49,494
are found among your belongings,

316
00:16:49,494 --> 00:16:52,494
the police will most naturally contact us.

317
00:16:52,494 --> 00:16:55,194
If the police learns from us

318
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:58,694
how much of a fan of this movie you are,

319
00:16:58,694 --> 00:16:59,994
and that the friend who called

320
00:16:59,994 --> 00:17:04,094
really wanted your ticket for the preview,

321
00:17:04,094 --> 00:17:07,894
and if he is found to be holding the preview tickets

322
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:10,494
with your fingerprints on it,

323
00:17:10,494 --> 00:17:13,694
they would most probably think...

324
00:17:13,694 --> 00:17:17,394
This friend of yours called you just before the preview

325
00:17:17,394 --> 00:17:20,094
and pushed you off the roof

326
00:17:20,094 --> 00:17:22,594
and stole the ticket from you.

327
00:17:23,994 --> 00:17:25,894
By the way,

328
00:17:25,894 --> 00:17:28,894
you deliberately asked where the elevator was

329
00:17:28,894 --> 00:17:32,194
because you wanted to leave an impression that you were with a friend.

330
00:17:32,194 --> 00:17:34,394
You also deliberately dropped your ticket

331
00:17:34,394 --> 00:17:37,794
to get my friend's fingerprints on it.

332
00:17:38,694 --> 00:17:42,594
After the preview, if among the tickets that the police collect,

333
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:46,094
they find a ticket with the fingerprints of your friend

334
00:17:46,094 --> 00:17:48,494
and my friend fingerprints on,

335
00:17:48,494 --> 00:17:52,594
it would serve as proof that when you met us today,

336
00:17:52,594 --> 00:17:55,194
you in fact had that ticket with you.

337
00:17:57,594 --> 00:17:59,394
You're a smart boy.

338
00:17:59,394 --> 00:18:02,994
But, I wonder if the police will really believe the testimony

339
00:18:02,994 --> 00:18:05,794
and deduction of just you alone.

340
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:07,494
They sure will!

341
00:18:09,394 --> 00:18:10,694
He alone may not do, but...

342
00:18:10,694 --> 00:18:13,894
-If there are five of us... -They'll believe us!

343
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:16,094
Besides, we passed the man

344
00:18:16,094 --> 00:18:18,494
that looked to be your friend just a while ago,

345
00:18:18,494 --> 00:18:20,294
but I think he's already left the building

346
00:18:20,294 --> 00:18:23,394
and headed for the movie preview.

347
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,894
So, even if you were to jump off now,

348
00:18:25,894 --> 00:18:29,294
there would be a time discrepancy and your trick would go to waste.

349
00:18:29,294 --> 00:18:31,394
Too bad.

350
00:18:31,394 --> 00:18:32,894
Darn.

351
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:34,994
You don't understand a tinge of how I feel.

352
00:18:34,994 --> 00:18:37,094
In fact we do.

353
00:18:37,094 --> 00:18:40,994
Your motive for doing this is because three years ago,

354
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,894
your girlfriend died of a traffic accident,

355
00:18:43,894 --> 00:18:47,394
in which this friend of yours was driving, right?

356
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:49,194
How did you find out about it?

357
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:53,194
You had a ticket and picture stuck inside your pocketbook, didn't you?

358
00:18:53,194 --> 00:18:57,094
It was the preview ticket of Star Blade V three years ago,

359
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,094
and the picture was of you and your girlfriend

360
00:18:59,094 --> 00:19:02,694
sitting in the backseat of the car.

361
00:19:02,694 --> 00:19:04,994
The one who took the picture was probably the driver

362
00:19:04,994 --> 00:19:07,494
and a friend who agreed to take your picture.

363
00:19:07,494 --> 00:19:11,194
Moreover, there was blood on one of the tickets,

364
00:19:11,194 --> 00:19:12,694
and the date on the picture was the same

365
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:14,094
as the date of the preview three years ago,

366
00:19:14,094 --> 00:19:16,394
so it's not hard to deduce.

367
00:19:16,394 --> 00:19:20,594
An accident that prevented you from going to the preview occurred,

368
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:23,694
and the one who was to blame for it was that friend of yours

369
00:19:23,694 --> 00:19:26,294
that you tried to set up as a killer for murdering you,

370
00:19:26,294 --> 00:19:30,294
as well as the one who was most probably driving the car.

371
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,394
Yeah, exactly.

372
00:19:32,394 --> 00:19:36,594
If he didn't over sleep that day...

373
00:19:36,594 --> 00:19:39,494
If only he had come to pick us up at the appointed time...

374
00:19:39,494 --> 00:19:41,194
We wouldn't have had to run into that hateful truck

375
00:19:41,194 --> 00:19:43,194
with the driver sleeping at the wheels!

376
00:19:47,094 --> 00:19:49,094
But, that's...

377
00:19:49,094 --> 00:19:50,794
Holding a grudge against the wrong person, isn't it?

378
00:19:50,794 --> 00:19:56,894
Yeah. I thought so too and held back my feelings.

379
00:19:56,894 --> 00:20:00,894
But, after a long absence of three years he calls me and says,

380
00:20:00,894 --> 00:20:04,994
"Do you have any extra tickets for the preview of Star Blade VI?"

381
00:20:04,994 --> 00:20:08,094
And after taking the ticket from me,

382
00:20:08,094 --> 00:20:11,494
he headed happily towards the theater.

383
00:20:11,494 --> 00:20:14,394
As if he'd forgotten about what happened three years ago.

384
00:20:14,394 --> 00:20:16,194
All he was thinking about

385
00:20:16,194 --> 00:20:18,594
was the confrontation of Dark Takio against Bei-Ju and Kisasa.

386
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:21,094
Those two are not going to fight!

387
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:24,694
Dark Takio is now on Bei-Ju and Kisasa's side!

388
00:20:24,694 --> 00:20:26,094
I see.

389
00:20:26,094 --> 00:20:30,194
Neither he, nor his friend hasn't saw Star Blade V.

390
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:34,194
But, his friend still wanted the ticket, which means...

391
00:20:34,194 --> 00:20:37,394
Is the site of the accident that happened three years ago near here?

392
00:20:37,394 --> 00:20:38,794
Yeah.

393
00:20:38,794 --> 00:20:40,494
That's why I was going to jump off from this building.

394
00:20:40,494 --> 00:20:41,994
Please take me there.

395
00:20:47,594 --> 00:20:51,394
He's the man we passed a while ago in the building.

396
00:20:51,394 --> 00:20:54,194
But, that's not where the theater is.

397
00:20:54,194 --> 00:20:55,894
Narukawa?

398
00:20:55,894 --> 00:20:57,694
Where's the site of the accident?

399
00:20:57,694 --> 00:20:59,194
Over there.

400
00:20:59,194 --> 00:21:01,194
She was dragged blown over by the truck

401
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:03,594
and crashed into that guard rail.

402
00:21:06,094 --> 00:21:08,594
Something's stuck here.

403
00:21:10,694 --> 00:21:11,794
Just as I thought.

404
00:21:11,794 --> 00:21:13,294
What's that?

405
00:21:13,294 --> 00:21:16,694
The ticket for the preview of Star Blade VI.

406
00:21:16,694 --> 00:21:18,094
What?

407
00:21:18,094 --> 00:21:21,794
The ticket of three years ago is stuck on this side.

408
00:21:21,794 --> 00:21:24,094
It's all beat up from wind and rain though.

409
00:21:24,094 --> 00:21:26,594
But, why would he...

410
00:21:26,594 --> 00:21:28,294
What an idiot!

411
00:21:28,294 --> 00:21:30,594
He wanted your girlfriend to see the preview!

412
00:21:30,594 --> 00:21:35,594
If he offers it here, it may reach the heavens, right?

413
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:40,994
Besides, since he said nothing about it to you,

414
00:21:40,994 --> 00:21:46,594
I'm sure he liked your girlfriend too.

415
00:21:46,594 --> 00:21:48,894
Almost as much as you did.

416
00:23:17,394 --> 00:23:19,794
There's only three minutes to go

417
00:23:19,794 --> 00:23:22,294
till the event before the preview starts.

418
00:23:22,294 --> 00:23:23,394
What?

419
00:23:23,394 --> 00:23:26,794
Why don't you come to the preview with us too?

420
00:23:26,794 --> 00:23:30,194
Watch it closely, and tell your girlfriend about it!

421
00:23:30,194 --> 00:23:33,094
The fact is, we have one extra ticket.

422
00:23:33,094 --> 00:23:35,694
It's Pops' ticket because he decided not to come.

423
00:23:37,294 --> 00:23:38,994
Thank you.

424
00:23:38,994 --> 00:23:40,494
But, I don't think so.

425
00:23:40,494 --> 00:23:42,694
Because I didn't see Star Blade V yet.

426
00:23:42,694 --> 00:23:47,094
And, as for Star Blade V and VI,

427
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:48,394
I'll buy the DVD

428
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:50,394
because I want to watch it with him at his house.

429
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,740
They're late.

430
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,920
Next Conan's Hint:

431
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,920
"Collection"

432
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,840
Collector appears in the next episode!

433
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,260
Haibara, what are you collecting?

434
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,260
It's a secret.
