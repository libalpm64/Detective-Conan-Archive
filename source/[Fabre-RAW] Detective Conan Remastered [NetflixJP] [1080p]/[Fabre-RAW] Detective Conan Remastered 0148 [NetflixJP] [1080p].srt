1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,160
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,960
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,560
The streetcar stops.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,760
Is it an accident or a murder case? A strange incident occurs.

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,460
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,460
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,860
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:42,970
"The Streetcar Case"

9
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,370
"Harii Station"

10
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,370
What has taken Conan so long?

11
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,870
It's already 5:40 p.m.

12
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,470
There he is!

13
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,570
Over here, Conan!

14
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,470
-You're late, Conan. -I'm sorry.

15
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,070
What were you doing? You're 10 minutes late!

16
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,670
I overslept.

17
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,170
We don't have time to waste, you know.

18
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,370
They say that it takes hours

19
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,670
before we can get on the new thrill-packed ride of Beika Land.

20
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,570
If we go from now,

21
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,070
we'll most likely be the first ones in line.

22
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,170
Of course. It's still before 6 a.m. in the morning.

23
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,170
The train for Beika Land will be arriving.

24
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,570
Please stand behind the white line.

25
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,170
There it is!

26
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,370
Hey, let's get on!

27
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,570
Wow! It's like we chartered this streetcar!

28
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,370
Not too many people would think of

29
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,670
riding the streetcar from so early Sunday morning.

30
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,970
Gosh. They're not here yet.

31
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,770
Gosh, those guys... What's with them?

32
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,570
Although Horii is always late, it's unusual.

33
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,570
It's unusual for Shimizu to be late.

34
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,470
Are you alone today?

35
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,770
No, two more people should be coming.

36
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:10,870
May I ask is anything the matter?

37
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,270
I don't mind you people taking pictures in the streetcar,

38
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,270
but please don't disturb other passengers.

39
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,870
Yes, sir.

40
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,170
I made it!

41
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,070
You're late, Shimizu!

42
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,970
I'm sorry, Kawasaki. I overslept.

43
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,970
Huh? Where's Horii?

44
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,070
He's not here yet, like always.

45
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,970
He should be here any minute then.

46
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,170
Because it's almost time to leave.

47
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,270
-True. -Good morning.

48
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,170
Sorry.

49
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,070
I'm a bit late, aren't I?

50
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,670
What do you mean "you're sorry"?

51
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,170
You're never on time.

52
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,270
Wow! This is fantastic!

53
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:03,070
This way better than the driving game after all.

54
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:07,170
Yes. Nothing can beat the real thing.

55
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,470
Are you going to Beika Land too?

56
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,970
Nope.

57
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,770
We're members of the Beikayama-dai research committee

58
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,470
and we came to take pictures of streetcars.

59
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:23,170
The number of streetcars have decreased lately, haven't they?

60
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,070
We're going to be going as exchange students to Germany too,

61
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,270
so we want to take pictures of streetcars

62
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,170
before they disappear all together.

63
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,270
Leave it to me.

64
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,270
Yeah, we're counting on you.

65
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,470
Although he may not look it,

66
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,970
Mr. Kawasaki's only talent of taking pictures is virtually professional.

67
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,870
Hey, Shimizu! Cut out the "only", will you?

68
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,570
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,670
The next stop is Harii Shrine.

70
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,070
This is our stop.

71
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,770
Huh? Are you getting off already?

72
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,170
Yeah. There's a great place just beyond here

73
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,370
where we can get great shots of streetcars.

74
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,770
Great spot?

75
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,370
If I wrap it around twice, that should do it.

76
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,370
Hey, Horii and Shimizu.

77
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,370
The camera case is brand new

78
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,170
and the camera is inside it too.

79
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,170
So, don't let anybody touch it.

80
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,070
Okay. Remember, we're counting on you, Kawasaki.

81
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,370
Take good pictures, okay?

82
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,070
Leave it to me!

83
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,870
The bus is leaving soon.

84
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,270
Off we go!

85
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,770
Okay, I made it in time.

86
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,270
Hello?

87
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,170
Senior Kawasaki.

88
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,670
The streetcar just started off.

89
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,170
Okay, I'm all ready too.

90
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,870
Give it your best shot.

91
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,370
Senior Horii.

92
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,270
Shall we take pictures from the rear window then?

93
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,670
Okay.

94
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,370
Hey! Are you all right?

95
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,070
Mr. Kawasaki, are you hurt?

96
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,870
No, I'm fine. I was just a bit surprised.

97
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,370
Gosh. Enough is enough.

98
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,670
You would've been dead, you know!

99
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,370
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,070
Why did you fall on the rails?

101
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,170
The ladder suddenly swayed

102
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,670
when I was up there taking pictures.

103
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:29,270
All four legs of the ladder is supposed to be steady.

104
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,770
What are these scratches?

105
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,870
There are scratches over there too.

106
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,170
What is that?

107
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,670
An "S" shaped hook.

108
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,170
Moreover, a piano line is tied onto it.

109
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,270
Maybe this is...

110
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,870
I'm really sorry.

111
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,470
Well, it's a good thing that you're okay.

112
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,570
Please get back inside, everyone.

113
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,870
We're starting off.

114
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,170
What are you doing, Conan?

115
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,670
The streetcar will start off.

116
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,570
Okay.

117
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,570
Okay. Is everybody on?

118
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,870
Everybody's on!

119
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,970
If Genta is on board, everyone else is!

120
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,070
Correct! Huh? What does that mean?

121
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,670
Huh?

122
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,570
What's the matter, Mr. Horii?

123
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,870
Hey, Horii. What're you doing?

124
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,370
Don't touch him!

125
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,770
Hey, sonny.

126
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,470
What do you mean, "don't touch him"?

127
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,270
Driver, please call the police.

128
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,470
Just what do you mean by call the police?

129
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,670
Don't tell me...

130
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,670
Right. He's already dead.

131
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,170
What?

132
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,870
This is...

133
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,270
a lump on his forehead

134
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,070
and a lacerated wound on the back of his head.

135
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,870
Blood on the bottom of the camera case?

136
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,670
Blood on the floor.

137
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,570
What on earth is this?

138
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,570
The victim who died after falling is

139
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,270
Mr. Masao Horii, age 22.

140
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,470
He has bruises on his forehead

141
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,970
and a large laceration on the back of his head.

142
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,270
The cause of his death

143
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,870
is probably the laceration on the back of his head.

144
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,270
Hello, everyone.

145
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,170
I am Officer Wakai of the Harii Police Station.

146
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:50,670
Could I have you explain the circumstances when Mr. Horii fell?

147
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,270
I was watching Mr. Kawasaki

148
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,870
when he fell off the ladder to the rails.

149
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:00,170
When the streetcar suddenly stopped, so I saw nothing.

150
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:04,070
I was so scared, that I closed my eyes, so...

151
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,070
I was so absorbed in what was going on in front,

152
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,370
so I didn't see anything either.

153
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,970
I was taking pictures together with Mr. Horii

154
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,970
at the rear of the streetcar.

155
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,670
Then, the streetcar suddenly screeched to a stop,

156
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,570
and I was thrown forward.

157
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:22,770
So, I don't know how Mr. Horii was then.

158
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,870
I see. And you?

159
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,670
I braked the streetcar to a stop,

160
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,170
went outside immediately and ran over to him,

161
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:33,070
that I don't know anything about the person who died.

162
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,370
I see.

163
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,870
All of you rushed outside the streetcar.

164
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,570
Did anyone from outside

165
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,470
get on board the streetcar during that time?

166
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,470
It was only a few minutes later

167
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,670
that we came back on board the streetcar,

168
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:47,270
so I don't think anyone came on board.

169
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,570
I see.

170
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,470
Judging from Mr. Horii's laceration on the back of his head

171
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,970
and the blood stain on the camera case,

172
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,870
Mr. Horii lost his balance

173
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,270
when the streetcar suddenly stopped.

174
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,370
Then, he fell on his back and hit the back of his head

175
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,470
on the camera case that was placed by the exit.

176
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,870
This is an accident.

177
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,670
A genuine accident.

178
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,670
What? But it's strange.

179
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,270
What's strange?

180
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:17,570
There is no mistake in my judgment who is headed for

181
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,570
the post of Superintendent General of the Metropolitan Police.

182
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,870
What would a kid like you know?

183
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,070
It's up to you where you're headed for.

184
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,470
But we're members of the Youth Detective Squad too.

185
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,570
Right. We're disciples of the renown detective, Kogoro Mouri.

186
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,070
Gosh.

187
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:36,570
What? You mean the famous Sleeping Kogoro?

188
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,670
So, what's so strange, sonny?

189
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,970
Look at this camera case.

190
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,470
There is a lot of blood on the bottom of the case,

191
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,170
but if he fell on top of it,

192
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,870
shouldn't there be a lot of blood on the top?

193
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,570
I see.

194
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,470
The camera case probably rolled over

195
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,170
when the streetcar suddenly stopped.

196
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,670
But the shoulder belt of the camera case

197
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:06,470
was fixed onto the railing, so I don't think it moved.

198
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,970
This shoulder belt...

199
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,170
I'm sure that back then...

200
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,970
If I wrap it around twice, that should do it.

201
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,470
Hey, Horii and Shimizu.

202
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,770
The camera case is brand new.

203
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,670
That's strange.

204
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,370
l wrapped the shoulder belt around twice

205
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,170
and fixed it onto the railing when I got off the streetcar.

206
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,870
I told everyone not to touch it

207
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,470
because it's brand new and doesn't have even one scratch yet.

208
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,470
Gosh. There's a scratch on the side too.

209
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,770
What?

210
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:37,870
Then, are you saying that

211
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:42,070
someone removed your camera case from the railing?

212
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,870
Officer.

213
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,670
Don't you think it's strange that

214
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,770
he has a lump on his forehead despite falling backwards?

215
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,770
I see.

216
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,870
And besides, look here.

217
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,170
There's a lot of blood.

218
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,170
As if hit by...

219
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,070
No, it couldn't be.

220
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,070
That's impossible to do if the streetcar screeched to a stop.

221
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,370
This is undoubtedly an accident.

222
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,370
There is definitely no other possibility.

223
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,870
What a fix.

224
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,970
What's that?

225
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,470
Wait a sec.

226
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,070
This "S" shaped hook that was near the ladder.

227
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,570
And the scratch on the camera case.

228
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,270
I see. I get it.

229
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,070
Since the streetcar braked suddenly,

230
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,970
it looks impossible at first glance,

231
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,270
but this is not accident.

232
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,470
Mr. Horii was killed.

233
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:35,470
And the killer is here.

234
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:49,260
Driver, you can't keep your streetcar stalled here,

235
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,160
so please head back to the depot.

236
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,460
I'd like to take a recorded statement of the accident.

237
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,760
Yes, sir.

238
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,260
Hey, you. We're going to be taking recorded statements

239
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,460
from the people involved, so keep that in mind, will you?

240
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,560
Yes, sir.

241
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,260
Oh, no. I've got to do something about Officer Wakai.

242
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,760
But I can't use the anesthetic gun in front of everyone.

243
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,060
Moreover, there's no place to hide in this streetcar anyway.

244
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,160
Therefore, Mr. Kawasaki and Ms. Shimizu,

245
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,060
I'm going to have to make

246
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,360
a record of your statements of the accident,

247
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,060
so please give me some of your time.

248
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,860
-Yes, sir. -All right.

249
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,560
Will you please come along too, boys?

250
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,960
Yes, sir...

251
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,460
Wait, officer!

252
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,460
What is it, sonny?

253
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:37,160
Don't worry, I'll let you be the first one to testify.

254
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,660
No, that's not it.

255
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:43,460
I picked this up near the ladder that fell a while ago.

256
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,660
I wonder if it has anything to do with the accident.

257
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,560
What connection does that "S" shaped hook have

258
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,860
with Mr. Horii's accident?

259
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,260
Well, if this ladder didn't fall,

260
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,860
the streetcar wouldn't have braked to a stop, right?

261
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,860
So...

262
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,260
Let me see that hook.

263
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,360
Here you go, Officer.

264
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,160
Maybe...

265
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,760
It fits perfectly!

266
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,160
The scratch matches perfectly, after all.

267
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,460
So, this hook was hooked onto the ladder.

268
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,560
And this piano cord...

269
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,960
Officer Wakai.

270
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,160
A piano cord was tangled onto the bumper of the streetcar.

271
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,160
What? Show it to me!

272
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,460
Yes, it's this.

273
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,760
From the thickness, material and the cut edge,

274
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,260
it seems to be the same cord.

275
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,260
Sonny, where did you find this "S" shaped hook?

276
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,760
It was stuck to the metal part of this telephone pole.

277
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,760
I see. The scratch on the metal part of this pole is still new.

278
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,160
And I'm sure it's there too.

279
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,260
See! There's a scratch here too!

280
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,460
Right on the opposite side is the sign.

281
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,360
Just as I thought.

282
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,560
I see!

283
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,460
There is a cut off piano cord left on the pole of this sign.

284
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,160
Which means...

285
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,960
the piano cord which stretched out from the "S" shaped hook

286
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,360
stuck to the ladder,

287
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,960
was wrapped around a nearby telephone pole

288
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,060
and hooked on to a telephone pole about to meters behind,

289
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,860
then stretched over to the pole of the sign

290
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,660
on the opposite side of the rails.

291
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,560
The streetcar that came along, pulled the piano cord.

292
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,060
The leg of the ladder is dragged,

293
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,060
loses balance and falls.

294
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,360
The frame was thus forced to fall.

295
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,960
But who would do something like this?

296
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,360
This trick is too complicated to be a simple prank.

297
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,460
I wonder if the ladder falling

298
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:49,460
and Mr. Horii's death is connected?

299
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,760
I see! That's it!

300
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,660
I, Officer Wakai, will solve the mystery of this case.

301
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,060
Let's all go back to the streetcar.

302
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,160
Hey, hey. Can you work it out or what?

303
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,160
Okay, everyone, are you ready?

304
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,460
Mr. Horii didn't die of an accident.

305
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,260
He was murdered!

306
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,360
What?

307
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,360
But you just said it was an accident a while ago.

308
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,560
Yes, but I've also found out that Mr. Kawasaki's ladder

309
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,360
was rigged by someone and made to fall.

310
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,460
What? You mean somebody was trying to kill me?

311
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,360
Yes, maybe.

312
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,160
What do you mean?

313
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,160
You say that Mr. Horii didn't die of an accident,

314
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,460
and on top of that, you're saying that

315
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,160
somebody deliberately made Mr. Kawasaki's ladder fall.

316
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,460
I'll explain that now.

317
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,860
First, for the way that Mr. Horii was murdered.

318
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,860
If the murderer knew that the streetcar was going to stop suddenly.

319
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,160
Yes, if the ladder that Mr. Kawasaki was on

320
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,960
could be rigged to fall.

321
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,760
It would be possible to kill Mr. Horii in no time at all.

322
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,460
Mr. Kawasaki came falling

323
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,360
and your attention were all fixed on what was happening ahead.

324
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,760
Taking advantage of the situation,

325
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,460
the killer hit the back of Mr. Horii's head with the camera case.

326
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,860
And Mr. Horii who fell forward,

327
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,060
hit his forehead on the railing

328
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,460
and fell to the floor,

329
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,060
leaving a pool of blood.

330
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,060
The killer immediately

331
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,960
strapped the camera case back to where it was,

332
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,460
but being in a rush could only wrap the belt around the railing once.

333
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,660
Right after that, the streetcar suddenly stopped

334
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,360
that Mr. Horii's body slid

335
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,160
and he hit his head on the camera case.

336
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:45,460
At that time, the person who was nearest to Mr. Horii

337
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,060
was you, isn't that right? Ms. Shimizu!

338
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,660
You've gotta be kidding!

339
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,960
I was thrown forward when the streetcar stopped

340
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,060
and almost died too!

341
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,060
Driver.

342
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,260
There was another streetcar that went by before you, right?

343
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:05,360
It went by about 5:40 a.m.

344
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,560
If so, the killer rigged the piano cord after 5:40 a.m.

345
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,260
And it had to be somebody who knew that

346
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,560
Mr. Kawasaki was going to be taking pictures here.

347
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,560
Horii, Shimizu and I decided to take pictures here yesterday.

348
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,560
I took it there this morning before going to the station.

349
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,260
I was at Harii Station by 5:54 a.m.

350
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,160
It's about 4 kilometers from here to Harii Station, right?

351
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,460
You can come in 10 minutes by bicycle.

352
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,960
When the streetcar reached Harii Shrine station,

353
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,460
you called Mr. Kawasaki on your cellular, didn't you?

354
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,360
You wanted to confirm if Mr. Kawasaki was on the ladder, right?

355
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,860
Don't tell me that you really...

356
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,860
I didn't even touch the camera case,

357
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,560
nor did I kill Mr. Horii!

358
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,560
Besides, what proof do you have?

359
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,460
Proof? Well...

360
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,660
The nerve of accusing someone, without any proof.

361
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,060
Ms. Shimizu.

362
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,860
What's the scratch you have

363
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,960
on the palm on your hand and your wristwatch?

364
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,260
What about this scratch?

365
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,260
And that? The blood on the camera case.

366
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,560
Isn't that the blood that came from your wound?

367
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,360
You got this wound when you hit Mr. Horii

368
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,460
with the camera case, didn't you?

369
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,760
No!

370
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,360
How did the result of the investigation officers turn out?

371
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,760
According to the investigation officers,

372
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,660
the blood stain on the top right corner of the camera case

373
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,460
is not Mr. Horii's.

374
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,160
And fingerprints other than that of Mr. Horii

375
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,760
and Mr. Kawasaki were found.

376
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,360
How about it, Ms. Shimizu?

377
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,360
Ms. Shimizu, why'd you kill Horii?

378
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,960
I...

379
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,960
I was going steady with Mr. Horii,

380
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,460
and we also promised to get married to each other.

381
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,460
And when it turned out that

382
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,460
he would be going to Germany as an exchange student,

383
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,760
I told him I wanted to go with him, but...

384
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,760
Sorry. I can't take you with me.

385
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,960
I've got a fiancee there that my parents picked for me.

386
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,960
I'm getting married in Germany.

387
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,060
I couldn't forgive Mr. Horii.

388
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,560
I couldn't forgive him.

389
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:40,660
I couldn't forgive him, no matter what.

390
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,060
Good work, Youth Detective Squad!

391
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,360
I'll give you my autograph in memory of this.

392
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,660
Huh?

393
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,260
I, Kenji Wakai, has determined the streetcar accident

394
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,260
that the Youth Detective Squad were pursuing as being a murder case,

395
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,760
and have solved it as such.

396
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,960
Hey, hey.

397
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,160
Youth Detective Squad! I'll see you again someday!

398
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,360
Oh, my!

399
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,560
You'd better be careful not to trip over a promotion.
