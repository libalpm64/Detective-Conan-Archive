1
00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:05,727
A strange letter was delivered to Heiji Hattori.

2
00:00:05,727 --> 00:00:09,527
It was from the culprit who had killed

3
00:00:09,527 --> 00:00:12,927
the design company president Mr. Kansuke Wakamatsu,

4
00:00:12,927 --> 00:00:15,427
a month ago at his villa in Karuizawa.

5
00:00:15,427 --> 00:00:18,627
Kazuha goes to Wakamatsu's main house in Osaka

6
00:00:18,627 --> 00:00:22,027
as indicated in place of Heiji who had caught a cold,

7
00:00:22,027 --> 00:00:25,527
and encounters an eerie figure with long hair there.

8
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:31,127
That figure had vanished during a moment's black-out,

9
00:00:31,127 --> 00:00:34,327
but what's weirder is that the characters "EYE"

10
00:00:34,327 --> 00:00:38,027
that was carved on the wall had also vanished.

11
00:00:38,027 --> 00:00:40,427
The fact is, even at the incident in Karuizawa,

12
00:00:40,427 --> 00:00:42,127
the victim had written a dying message

13
00:00:42,127 --> 00:00:43,727
with his own blood on the tile floor,

14
00:00:43,727 --> 00:00:45,527
but that had also vanished.

15
00:00:45,527 --> 00:00:47,227
We visited the Wakamatsu residence in Tokyo

16
00:00:47,227 --> 00:00:51,327
to check out the truth of the matter, when in front of us,

17
00:00:51,327 --> 00:00:54,127
his son Ikuro was poisoned to death!

18
00:00:56,827 --> 00:00:58,227
Kazuha, get on the phone!

19
00:00:58,227 --> 00:01:00,927
-And call the police? -Yeah!

20
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:04,027
Tell them that the idiot who had the nerve to kill a person

21
00:01:04,027 --> 00:01:05,927
right in front of a detective is here!

22
00:01:24,927 --> 00:01:26,627
If all cases were men,

23
00:01:26,627 --> 00:01:28,327
all hidden mysteries are women.

24
00:01:28,327 --> 00:01:30,227
What does the alphabet "S",

25
00:01:30,227 --> 00:01:31,927
the dying message that the president leave behind mean?

26
00:01:31,927 --> 00:01:33,527
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,427
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:37,827
His name is Detective Conan!

29
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:07,982
"Design of Poison and Illusion (S)"

30
00:03:08,582 --> 00:03:10,782
The one about the case last month where the president was killed

31
00:03:10,782 --> 00:03:13,182
and found in the bath room of his villa in Karuizawa.

32
00:03:13,182 --> 00:03:16,882
You were the first one to find him, weren't you?

33
00:03:16,882 --> 00:03:17,982
Yes.

34
00:03:17,982 --> 00:03:20,882
Back then, there should've been a dying message

35
00:03:20,882 --> 00:03:23,482
that the president wrote with his own blood.

36
00:03:23,482 --> 00:03:26,782
But when the police got there, it was gone, right?

37
00:03:26,782 --> 00:03:29,382
If I remember correctly,

38
00:03:29,382 --> 00:03:31,782
you said that you remember that word that disappeared.

39
00:03:31,782 --> 00:03:34,082
I remember you said something about it being an alphabet.

40
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:37,182
Don't tell me that the alphabets were...

41
00:03:37,182 --> 00:03:41,682
E-Y-E?

42
00:03:41,682 --> 00:03:43,982
It's probably referring to "eyes"!

43
00:03:43,982 --> 00:03:45,482
I saw it, too!

44
00:03:45,482 --> 00:03:47,882
I was contacted by the culprit who said he killed the president,

45
00:03:47,882 --> 00:03:50,482
who told me to come to the president's residence in Osaka.

46
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:53,282
That's when I saw the eerie three letters that disappeared!

47
00:03:53,282 --> 00:03:56,082
My... At that house in Osaka?

48
00:03:56,082 --> 00:03:59,782
That's why we came all the way out here to hear more about it.

49
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:03,182
But, what I saw was...

50
00:04:03,182 --> 00:04:05,482
the alphabet "S"!

51
00:04:05,482 --> 00:04:07,382
There seemed to be continuation of something else

52
00:04:07,382 --> 00:04:09,682
but it covered by his hand and I couldn't see it.

53
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:11,782
"S", was it?

54
00:04:11,782 --> 00:04:13,482
Hey! Hold it!

55
00:04:13,482 --> 00:04:16,082
The managing director Mr. Masashige Shiina

56
00:04:16,082 --> 00:04:18,982
as well as Chief designer Mr. Masuo Fujinami,

57
00:04:18,982 --> 00:04:21,282
the secretary Ms. Yoshiimi Satake,

58
00:04:21,282 --> 00:04:24,282
and the president's wife Mrs. Serika Wakanatsu,

59
00:04:24,282 --> 00:04:27,682
all have either names or last names

60
00:04:27,682 --> 00:04:30,982
starting with the letter "S"!

61
00:04:30,982 --> 00:04:36,382
My name is Sakurako, so it also starts with "S".

62
00:04:36,382 --> 00:04:37,582
What?

63
00:04:37,582 --> 00:04:38,882
Which means

64
00:04:38,882 --> 00:04:41,082
the person who doesn't the initial "S" in his name

65
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:44,382
is Ikuro who was killed this time?

66
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:48,382
And? What did you do after you found the corpse?

67
00:04:48,382 --> 00:04:52,582
I went to the living room of the villa to get Mrs. Wakamatsu.

68
00:04:52,582 --> 00:04:53,982
Yes.

69
00:04:53,982 --> 00:04:56,882
I confirmed the corpse of my husband together with her.

70
00:04:57,882 --> 00:05:01,082
Call the ambulance immediately!

71
00:05:01,082 --> 00:05:02,182
Yes, ma'am!

72
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:04,182
Use the telephone in the study!

73
00:05:04,182 --> 00:05:05,182
Because there are times

74
00:05:05,182 --> 00:05:08,182
when the connection is not good on the cell phone in this area.

75
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,982
And I go tell Ikuro about this

76
00:05:11,982 --> 00:05:15,082
because I think he's still asleep in his room.

77
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:17,882
Please make sure that no one sees you

78
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:21,382
because I don't want anyone to see my husband like this.

79
00:05:21,382 --> 00:05:23,382
Yes, ma'am!

80
00:05:23,382 --> 00:05:25,082
And when the police arrived,

81
00:05:25,082 --> 00:05:28,082
the dying message was gone?

82
00:05:28,082 --> 00:05:29,482
Yes.

83
00:05:29,482 --> 00:05:32,582
After making the call, I returned immediately to the bath room,

84
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:36,782
to find Ikuro clinging to his father and crying.

85
00:05:36,782 --> 00:05:39,982
But it seems that the letters were already gone then.

86
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:43,682
-Mrs. Wakamatsu, didn't you see the letters? -No.

87
00:05:43,682 --> 00:05:46,482
Because I was distracted right through looking at my husband's body.

88
00:05:46,482 --> 00:05:48,382
Then, is it true that the same tiles

89
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:50,382
were used in the bath room of the villa

90
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:53,082
and the bath room of the house in Osaka?

91
00:05:53,082 --> 00:05:54,382
Yes.

92
00:05:54,382 --> 00:05:57,882
They were both made with tiles that my husband had special ordered.

93
00:05:57,882 --> 00:06:00,582
But the rebuilding construction of

94
00:06:00,582 --> 00:06:02,882
the main house in Osaka has already begun,

95
00:06:02,882 --> 00:06:04,582
and as for the villa in Karuizawa,

96
00:06:04,582 --> 00:06:07,682
as soon as the no trespassing cordon is taken away,

97
00:06:07,682 --> 00:06:09,682
it is scheduled to be demolished.

98
00:06:09,682 --> 00:06:12,682
We may not be able to see it ever again.

99
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:18,682
Then, where were you all when the president was killed?

100
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:21,082
We were in the living room together with the vice-president.

101
00:06:21,082 --> 00:06:22,682
Actually there were a lot more people

102
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,982
who came to the vice-president's birthday party.

103
00:06:25,982 --> 00:06:29,682
I was about to go home after the party with all the others

104
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:32,282
when the president called me.

105
00:06:32,282 --> 00:06:34,982
He said he had something important to talk about.

106
00:06:34,982 --> 00:06:37,982
Since the president told us to wait

107
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:40,082
until he finished sticking all the tiles of the bath room on.

108
00:06:40,082 --> 00:06:43,782
All four of us were waiting in the living room

109
00:06:43,782 --> 00:06:46,282
while playing poker for about two hours.

110
00:06:47,582 --> 00:06:50,682
In other words, we've got a perfect alibi!

111
00:06:50,682 --> 00:06:53,582
Because of the letter "S" that the housekeeper found,

112
00:06:53,582 --> 00:06:56,282
we were the first to be suspected.

113
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:59,282
So we were persistently questioned by the police.

114
00:06:59,282 --> 00:07:02,682
But because the president's wallet was gone,

115
00:07:02,682 --> 00:07:05,182
and the murder weapon not being found.

116
00:07:05,182 --> 00:07:08,082
Because there were traces of someone having broken in,

117
00:07:08,082 --> 00:07:09,682
it was concluded that

118
00:07:09,682 --> 00:07:12,582
what the housekeeper saw was probably a mistake.

119
00:07:12,582 --> 00:07:14,282
It seems that the Nagano Prefectural Police

120
00:07:14,282 --> 00:07:17,182
is now investigating case as a break-in by an intruder.

121
00:07:18,782 --> 00:07:21,182
Mr. Mouri, may I have a word with you?

122
00:07:21,182 --> 00:07:22,482
Huh?

123
00:07:25,582 --> 00:07:29,282
What? No poison was detected?

124
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,682
There was none from the other pieces of baumkuchen?

125
00:07:31,682 --> 00:07:33,482
No.

126
00:07:33,482 --> 00:07:34,682
Toxic reaction was detected

127
00:07:34,682 --> 00:07:38,682
only from the capsule that was found at the bottom of the teacup.

128
00:07:38,682 --> 00:07:43,382
But the toxic reaction found in the teacup was also very slight,

129
00:07:43,382 --> 00:07:45,482
so it could've been put there just to hide the evidence

130
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:48,982
after having finished using the poison,

131
00:07:48,982 --> 00:07:51,782
or like you said, there is a high probability of foul play

132
00:07:51,782 --> 00:07:54,282
being used to throw the investigation off.

133
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:59,382
Which means that only the piece of baumkuchen

134
00:07:59,382 --> 00:08:01,182
that Ikuro ate was poisoned.

135
00:08:01,182 --> 00:08:02,982
How strange.

136
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,582
Back then, Ikuro ate one of the two pieces

137
00:08:05,582 --> 00:08:08,182
that were left on the tray.

138
00:08:08,182 --> 00:08:10,682
How did the culprit make Ikuro pick up

139
00:08:10,682 --> 00:08:12,882
the poisoned piece of baumkuchen?

140
00:08:12,882 --> 00:08:15,482
Maybe the piece was a little larger after all?

141
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:16,982
Right, right!

142
00:08:16,982 --> 00:08:19,582
It seems that he was pretty greedy when it came to food.

143
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,382
Actually we thought so, too.

144
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:23,482
So we went to the same store,

145
00:08:23,482 --> 00:08:26,582
bought baumkuchen of the same size

146
00:08:26,582 --> 00:08:27,882
and placed it on the tray back at the scene of the crime

147
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,482
together with the 7 pieces that were left behind.

148
00:08:29,482 --> 00:08:31,782
It was perfectly divided into 8 even pieces.

149
00:08:31,782 --> 00:08:33,182
What?

150
00:08:33,182 --> 00:08:36,782
Then what? You mean the culprit sprinkled poison

151
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,982
on the baumkuchen after Ikuro picked up the piece,

152
00:08:38,982 --> 00:08:41,782
yet no one realized what happened?

153
00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:43,382
Of course not.

154
00:08:43,382 --> 00:08:46,482
I mean, we're not dealing with an invisible man, you know.

155
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:49,282
It sure resembles the letter that was sent to you, no?

156
00:08:49,282 --> 00:08:51,482
Yeah.

157
00:08:51,482 --> 00:08:53,682
I'm a warped entity

158
00:08:53,682 --> 00:08:56,382
that was created at the liberty of you humans.

159
00:08:58,082 --> 00:09:00,082
You can't see him with the naked eye.

160
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:02,182
You mean he's an illusion?

161
00:09:03,282 --> 00:09:05,982
Really?

162
00:09:05,982 --> 00:09:08,382
Is it true that only the piece of baumkuchen

163
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,382
that Ikuro ate was poisoned?

164
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:11,682
Yes.

165
00:09:11,682 --> 00:09:13,482
Moreover, when we put the 7 pieces of baumkuchen

166
00:09:13,482 --> 00:09:15,682
that were left back at the scene of the crime,

167
00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:18,882
on top of a baumkuchen before it was cut,

168
00:09:18,882 --> 00:09:21,082
including the piece that Ikuro ate,

169
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:24,282
we found the pieces to be evenly divided into 8 pieces.

170
00:09:24,282 --> 00:09:26,482
Well, it would be a different story

171
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,782
if the sizes of the pieces were the same,

172
00:09:27,782 --> 00:09:29,882
but the poisoned piece was placed in the foreground

173
00:09:29,882 --> 00:09:31,482
making it easy to take, though.

174
00:09:31,482 --> 00:09:33,182
It wasn't the one in the foreground!

175
00:09:33,182 --> 00:09:36,282
Ikuro stretched over to pick up a piece that was farther back!

176
00:09:36,282 --> 00:09:39,382
-Right? Ms. Satake? -Yes.

177
00:09:39,382 --> 00:09:41,582
It looked like that to me.

178
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:45,282
But you two are the ones who cut the bamkuchen

179
00:09:45,282 --> 00:09:46,782
and put the pieces on the plates.

180
00:09:46,782 --> 00:09:48,182
Having you two who were in a position where you could

181
00:09:48,182 --> 00:09:50,182
most easily poison the baumkuchen saying that isn't very convincing.

182
00:09:50,182 --> 00:09:52,782
-I saw it, too! -What?

183
00:09:52,782 --> 00:09:56,182
Ikuro reaching over for the baumkuchen beyond.

184
00:09:56,182 --> 00:09:59,482
Right! I saw him, too!

185
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:01,782
I was curious why he reached all the way

186
00:10:01,782 --> 00:10:03,382
over for the piece beyond, you see!

187
00:10:05,282 --> 00:10:08,982
So back then, Ikuro must've received a lot of attention from everyone?

188
00:10:08,982 --> 00:10:11,182
He was saying something attention getting like

189
00:10:11,182 --> 00:10:13,282
"I'm going to be the next president", too.

190
00:10:13,282 --> 00:10:16,182
That's why I decided to follow him with my eyes.

191
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:21,182
Maybe the culprit bet on a 50/50 chance.

192
00:10:21,182 --> 00:10:22,382
Hey, hey.

193
00:10:22,382 --> 00:10:26,882
Then if Ikuro didn't pick the poisoned piece...

194
00:10:26,882 --> 00:10:29,682
If so, the culprit may have been thinking

195
00:10:29,682 --> 00:10:32,782
to drop the poisoned piece on the floor

196
00:10:32,782 --> 00:10:37,182
by making it look like it slipped, rendering it inedible.

197
00:10:37,182 --> 00:10:39,582
Moreover, on top of being greedy with food,

198
00:10:39,582 --> 00:10:40,782
it was obvious that Ikuro was starving

199
00:10:40,782 --> 00:10:43,882
so he would be the first to pick up a piece, too!

200
00:10:43,882 --> 00:10:45,382
I see.

201
00:10:45,382 --> 00:10:47,682
Or, maybe the culprit meant for Ikuro

202
00:10:47,682 --> 00:10:50,782
to eat the piece in the foreground that wasn't poisoned,

203
00:10:50,782 --> 00:10:53,782
and was planning to poison to death managing director Shiina

204
00:10:53,782 --> 00:10:57,282
who was supposed to be eating the piece that remained!

205
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:05,082
So if the culprit who killed the president in Karuizawa last month

206
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:07,382
and this time killed his son,

207
00:11:07,382 --> 00:11:12,682
or rather, maybe managing director is the same person.

208
00:11:12,682 --> 00:11:16,982
The cause may be in this house, or in the company.

209
00:11:16,982 --> 00:11:19,482
Doesn't anything ring a bell?

210
00:11:19,482 --> 00:11:22,182
No, there's nothing like that.

211
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,582
Now that you mentioned it...

212
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:29,382
I saw Mr. Wakamatsu arguing with Ikuro!

213
00:11:29,382 --> 00:11:32,082
"You're the one who's using company money, aren't you?"

214
00:11:32,082 --> 00:11:33,982
"Come on, spit it out!" He said.

215
00:11:33,982 --> 00:11:39,082
Ikuro shouted back, "Can't you trust your own son?"

216
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:41,182
Was that a usual occurrence?

217
00:11:41,182 --> 00:11:43,282
I think it was about a week

218
00:11:43,282 --> 00:11:45,382
before the president died in Karuizawa.

219
00:11:45,382 --> 00:11:48,282
Then, the thing he was planning to talk about at the villa that day

220
00:11:48,282 --> 00:11:50,982
making us sleep over there was...

221
00:11:50,982 --> 00:11:54,982
About the embezzlement of company money?

222
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:58,482
If that's the case, it's solved already.

223
00:11:58,482 --> 00:12:01,982
I found that it was the entry mistake I made in the account book.

224
00:12:01,982 --> 00:12:05,582
I was scolded severely by my husband later, though.

225
00:12:06,982 --> 00:12:09,482
Well, regardless of what the motive of the murder was,

226
00:12:09,482 --> 00:12:11,782
or who the target was,

227
00:12:11,782 --> 00:12:15,282
we'll have to have you replay the situation

228
00:12:15,282 --> 00:12:19,082
when Ikuro ate the baumkuchen and fell to the floor!

229
00:12:19,082 --> 00:12:21,482
While it's still fresh in your mind.

230
00:12:21,482 --> 00:12:24,382
We'll call you as soon as everything is ready.

231
00:12:24,382 --> 00:12:27,182
So, please wait in this room for a while more.

232
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:32,482
Shoots. How do they expect us to replay the scene?

233
00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:35,482
Well, it's useless just waiting, so...

234
00:12:35,482 --> 00:12:38,482
Ms. Satake, will show me the design of the letters

235
00:12:38,482 --> 00:12:40,482
you said you sent to this computer?

236
00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:42,182
Yes, ma'am!

237
00:12:42,182 --> 00:12:45,082
And, Ms. Yonehara.

238
00:12:45,082 --> 00:12:46,082
Yes.

239
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:48,082
Will you make more tea for us again?

240
00:12:48,082 --> 00:12:50,082
Yes, ma'am!

241
00:12:51,282 --> 00:12:52,582
Hey.

242
00:12:52,582 --> 00:12:53,982
If Karuizawa is under the jurisdiction

243
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,982
of the Nagano Prefectural Police,

244
00:12:56,982 --> 00:12:59,282
isn't the officer with the wounded eye that we met

245
00:12:59,282 --> 00:13:01,882
during the Fuurinkazan incident there?

246
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:04,782
Oh, you mean Inspector Kansuke Yamato.

247
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:07,082
Why don't we call him then?

248
00:13:07,082 --> 00:13:09,782
He may tell us something about the incident.

249
00:13:09,782 --> 00:13:12,782
But I don't know his phone number.

250
00:13:12,782 --> 00:13:14,582
If it's Yui's phone number,

251
00:13:14,582 --> 00:13:18,482
the officer that got along well with him, I have it!

252
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:20,982
Then, maybe we can ask him something about the incident!

253
00:13:20,982 --> 00:13:23,282
Yui had gone back to being an officer, besides!

254
00:13:23,282 --> 00:13:25,782
-Really? -Yep.

255
00:13:25,782 --> 00:13:29,382
But, how come you know her phone number?

256
00:13:29,382 --> 00:13:31,682
I begged her to give it to me later!

257
00:13:31,682 --> 00:13:33,682
On the day that the case was solved,

258
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:37,182
it seems that Yui was confessing how she felt to Inspector Yamato,

259
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:40,482
so I was concerned how it turned out, you see.

260
00:13:40,482 --> 00:13:42,982
I mean, it's hard to think that nothing would happen

261
00:13:42,982 --> 00:13:46,282
after she gave her heart out to him, right?

262
00:13:46,282 --> 00:13:49,782
And? Did something happen between the two?

263
00:13:49,782 --> 00:13:52,582
It seems that she ended up not confessing her feelings after all.

264
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,882
They haven't been phoning or mailing each other since then, I hear.

265
00:13:54,882 --> 00:13:56,582
It could be that the two are doing their thing

266
00:13:56,582 --> 00:13:59,982
without telling you about it then.

267
00:13:59,982 --> 00:14:01,082
You idiot!

268
00:14:01,082 --> 00:14:03,082
She told me that she would contact me

269
00:14:03,082 --> 00:14:04,282
if she confessed her feelings to him.

270
00:14:04,282 --> 00:14:07,582
She's not such a cold person besides!

271
00:14:07,582 --> 00:14:09,282
Kazuha.

272
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:12,482
I have something I have to tell you.

273
00:14:12,482 --> 00:14:14,282
Huh? What?

274
00:14:14,282 --> 00:14:16,682
Not here, though.

275
00:14:16,682 --> 00:14:20,382
Hey, hey. Let's call Yui quickly!

276
00:14:21,182 --> 00:14:22,382
Maybe she'll tell us

277
00:14:22,382 --> 00:14:26,182
what the tiles in the bath room

278
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:28,582
of where the president was killed were like.

279
00:14:28,582 --> 00:14:29,782
It seems that the tile

280
00:14:29,782 --> 00:14:33,082
is only left at the villa in Karuizawa already.

281
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:41,789
What? A family member of the president

282
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:43,989
who was killed at his villa in Karuizawa

283
00:14:43,989 --> 00:14:46,689
was killed tonight in Tokyo?

284
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:49,589
-Is that true, Kazuha? -Yep!

285
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,689
I just happened to be at the site of the crime

286
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:53,789
and is really in a fix.

287
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:56,689
Heiji says that maybe the murderer of the incident over there

288
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:59,889
are one and the same with the one here.

289
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:02,089
That's why we want you to show us

290
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:04,689
the tile of the bath room where the president was killed!

291
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:06,889
That's the voice of

292
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:09,589
the dark-skinned detective boy I met back then, right?

293
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:11,889
Are Conan and Kogoro there, too?

294
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:13,689
Yes, they are!

295
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:14,989
We're telling you that we want some clue

296
00:15:14,989 --> 00:15:17,689
if this is a case of serial killings!

297
00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:20,789
He could still be after somebody, besides.

298
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:23,389
We just happen to be at that villa right now,

299
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:26,689
and it's the first time I'm seeing the site of the crime too.

300
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:28,089
You understand that I'm not usually supposed

301
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:31,489
to be giving out information like that to outsiders, right?

302
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:33,089
Hey, Uehara.

303
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:35,189
If that's a personal call, do it later!

304
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:36,789
We're going on!

305
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:38,089
Yes, sir!

306
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:42,189
But the detective boys and you have been a lot of help to me,

307
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:43,689
and the circumstance being what it is,

308
00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:44,789
I'll try asking Kan-chan...

309
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:47,689
Rather, Inspector Yamato about it.

310
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:53,389
"Alcohol for the Young"

311
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:56,089
Maybe this is good?

312
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:58,889
It meets the demand of the client too.

313
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:01,589
But, don't you think it's a bit subdued?

314
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:04,589
I like the one three before this.

315
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,189
You mean this?

316
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:09,189
This is too flashy, don't you think?

317
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:11,689
What about the one two before it, then?

318
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:13,989
Vice-president, are you all right?

319
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:15,189
If your eyes are tired,

320
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:16,989
would you like to use my eye drops?

321
00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:20,089
I just bought it, so it's not even open yet.

322
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:21,389
Thank you.

323
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:24,089
I guess I'll use it then.

324
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:26,889
I'm sure you're exhausted.

325
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:28,989
So many things happened today too.

326
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,589
I guess so.

327
00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:34,789
Preparations have been completed.

328
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:35,789
Then, everyone,

329
00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:37,589
let's go over to the living room that is the site of the crime.

330
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:42,389
The vice-president doesn't have to participate in this, does she?

331
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:45,989
It looks like she's really tired.

332
00:16:45,989 --> 00:16:47,989
-But... -Besides, Mrs. Wakamatsu was

333
00:16:47,989 --> 00:16:50,389
sitting right through back then and besides,

334
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:52,589
she didn't go close even once

335
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:55,489
to the baumkuchen that Ikuro ate either.

336
00:16:55,489 --> 00:16:56,789
Right.

337
00:16:56,789 --> 00:16:58,989
Maybe it's meaningless for her to come with us?

338
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:03,189
If so, would it be alright for me to stay back here?

339
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,389
Since so much has happened,

340
00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:07,489
I'd like to be left alone for a while, too!

341
00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:09,389
If you say so...

342
00:17:09,389 --> 00:17:11,789
Well then, while you're waiting,

343
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:14,989
it would be a great help if you sign and stamp the contract

344
00:17:14,989 --> 00:17:17,989
that is in the drawer of that desk.

345
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,189
Oh, that...

346
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:25,489
But the ink of the pen that is on this desk is out of ink.

347
00:17:25,489 --> 00:17:27,689
Let me give you a fountain pen then.

348
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:30,889
It's what the president gave me a long time ago.

349
00:17:30,889 --> 00:17:32,989
Thank you, you're a great help.

350
00:17:32,989 --> 00:17:34,589
Shall we start going then?

351
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:36,989
Guess we got no choice.

352
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:48,389
There are two officers standing guard in front of the door.

353
00:17:48,389 --> 00:17:50,089
So if anything should happen, call them.

354
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:51,689
Yes.

355
00:18:14,489 --> 00:18:16,989
Excuse me.

356
00:18:16,989 --> 00:18:19,089
Is anything the matter?

357
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:23,289
Mrs. Wakamatsu mentioned that we not be able to see the bath room tile

358
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:27,689
at the villa in Karuizawa, but actually...

359
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:32,889
What?

360
00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:33,989
The tiles of the bath room in this house

361
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:36,789
are also the same type of tiles?

362
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:39,389
Why didn't you tell us about it a while ago?

363
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:41,889
Well, because Mrs. Wakamatsu didn't seem to like

364
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:43,789
having me talk about it.

365
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,489
Take us to that bath room, will you?

366
00:18:46,489 --> 00:18:47,489
Okay.

367
00:18:47,489 --> 00:18:50,989
So, we're borrowing the housekeeper for a while!

368
00:18:50,989 --> 00:18:53,989
You all go on to the living room ahead of us, okay?

369
00:18:53,989 --> 00:18:55,689
Hey.

370
00:18:55,689 --> 00:18:58,889
Precisely speaking, the color of the tiles

371
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:01,489
are a bit different from those at the villa though.

372
00:19:01,489 --> 00:19:03,689
The shapes of the tiles and the color

373
00:19:03,689 --> 00:19:05,889
are more or less the same.

374
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:13,089
This is...

375
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:17,389
Hey, Uehara.

376
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,889
I didn't hear anything about the tiles

377
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:21,789
being this way at the scene of the crime.

378
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:23,989
But, just like it's been reported,

379
00:19:23,989 --> 00:19:26,189
the color of the tiles gradually gets a little paler

380
00:19:26,189 --> 00:19:28,389
as you go from top to bottom.

381
00:19:28,389 --> 00:19:29,589
No.

382
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:31,089
It generally gets that way

383
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:32,689
because an optical illusion occurs!

384
00:19:32,689 --> 00:19:34,489
If I remember correctly, this is...

385
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:37,689
An optical illusionary diamond with shading...

386
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:41,489
better known also as Crazy Diamond.

387
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:44,689
Crazy Diamond?

388
00:19:44,689 --> 00:19:46,589
Each and every diamond shaped tile

389
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:49,989
measures an angle of 30 to 40 degrees from top to bottom.

390
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:53,189
Although there is only a slight gradation.

391
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:54,789
The eyes of people grasp the light

392
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:57,289
and dark parts of the border line of the adjoining diagonal shaped tiles

393
00:19:57,289 --> 00:20:00,989
as each and every dot,

394
00:20:00,989 --> 00:20:03,089
and only focus their attention on that certain part,

395
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:04,289
that optical illusion reacts to make it

396
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:05,989
looks as though it is being viewed in entirety.

397
00:20:05,989 --> 00:20:06,989
As a result, the diagonal shape on the top

398
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:08,489
and the diagonal shape on the bottom

399
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:11,389
look to be of totally different colors.

400
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:15,689
In other words, the brain miscalculates what it sees.

401
00:20:15,689 --> 00:20:17,389
As proof of this...

402
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,189
This tile here and the tile at the top

403
00:20:25,189 --> 00:20:27,189
are the same color, aren't they?

404
00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:31,289
True, amazing!

405
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:34,289
Komei! What did you come here for?

406
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:36,289
This case is one handled by the headquarters!

407
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:39,789
You guys of the jurisdiction have no place in this!

408
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:41,489
Haven't you heard?

409
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:44,889
I returned to prefectural headquarters as of today.

410
00:20:44,889 --> 00:20:46,689
Through my own efforts.

411
00:20:47,989 --> 00:20:51,889
At any rate, we've got to report this to Mr. Mouri and the others

412
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:53,989
who are at the residence of the president who was killed here!

413
00:20:53,989 --> 00:20:55,789
They say that there's been a murder there too

414
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:58,189
and that it may be the same killer.

415
00:20:58,189 --> 00:20:59,189
No.

416
00:20:59,189 --> 00:21:02,889
Contact them after forensics examine the site.

417
00:21:02,889 --> 00:21:05,089
-What? -Yeah.

418
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:06,689
If I remember correctly,

419
00:21:06,689 --> 00:21:09,489
the dying message that the president who was killed here,

420
00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:12,189
left behind had for some reason vanished.

421
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:15,189
If so, it is highly likely that the killer used illusion

422
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:18,389
to his advantage and switched the tiles with another!

423
00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:19,489
If we're going to contact them,

424
00:21:19,489 --> 00:21:22,889
let's do so after we revive the message.

425
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:24,389
If the letters were written with blood,

426
00:21:24,389 --> 00:21:28,289
even if it were erased, it can be revived by a luminol reagent.

427
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:31,189
What's this crazy diamond about?

428
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:32,689
What is it, anyway?

429
00:21:32,689 --> 00:21:36,389
So, it's a type of optical illusion, you see.

430
00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:39,189
Kazuha's cell phone is ringing!

431
00:21:41,889 --> 00:21:43,489
Hello?

432
00:21:43,489 --> 00:21:46,589
Hey, detective boy from Osaka.

433
00:21:46,589 --> 00:21:49,189
That voice! You're Inspector Yamato, aren't you?

434
00:21:49,189 --> 00:21:53,989
We just found the dying message of the president in question!

435
00:21:53,989 --> 00:21:55,489
Really?

436
00:21:55,489 --> 00:22:00,489
Three letters of the alphabet were written, "S-O-N"!

437
00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:03,689
Huh? "S-O-N"?

438
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,589
S-O-N...

439
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:06,789
Son.

440
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:08,089
His son?

441
00:22:08,089 --> 00:22:10,189
Yeah! If the killer of the case over here,

442
00:22:10,189 --> 00:22:12,989
and over there are the same,

443
00:22:12,989 --> 00:22:14,889
nab his son!

444
00:22:14,889 --> 00:22:17,989
Then, this case is closed!

445
00:22:17,989 --> 00:22:20,989
-That's impossible. -What?

446
00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:23,989
The one who was murdered here tonight

447
00:22:23,989 --> 00:22:26,089
is that son, that's why.

448
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:28,489
What?

449
00:22:28,489 --> 00:22:31,889
In other words, the one who murdered the president

450
00:22:31,889 --> 00:22:35,489
and the one who murdered his son are...

451
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:38,089
Are two different people?

452
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,640
Next Conan's Hint:

453
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,480
"Slipper"
