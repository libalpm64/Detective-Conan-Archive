1
00:00:03,466 --> 00:00:04,866
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:04,866 --> 00:00:06,766
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:08,066
The Youth Detective Squad goes clam digging.

4
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:11,066
The "younger brother" (Yokomizo) makes his appearance!

5
00:00:11,066 --> 00:00:12,366
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:13,966
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,966 --> 00:00:16,166
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:03,634 --> 00:02:05,234
Not yet?

9
00:02:05,234 --> 00:02:06,734
Just a little bit more.

10
00:02:06,734 --> 00:02:09,534
That's why we should've left the house earlier!

11
00:02:09,534 --> 00:02:12,734
It can't be helped because the roads were jammed with traffic.

12
00:02:51,034 --> 00:02:52,034
We did it!

13
00:02:52,034 --> 00:02:54,034
Finished!

14
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:56,434
How about it, Doc? Don't you think it's really something?

15
00:02:56,434 --> 00:02:57,934
Wow!

16
00:02:57,934 --> 00:03:00,834
What a magnificent sand castle!

17
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:05,134
Yes! I think we did a good job.

18
00:03:05,134 --> 00:03:07,334
I worked on it too!

19
00:03:07,334 --> 00:03:09,334
Although I didn't do much, I helped too!

20
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:14,034
I see. You all cooperated.

21
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:16,434
Hey, you guys.

22
00:03:16,434 --> 00:03:19,234
I thought we came here to dig clams?

23
00:03:19,234 --> 00:03:20,634
Come on, you guys!

24
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,434
But...

25
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:25,434
To be honest, I'm bored!

26
00:03:25,434 --> 00:03:28,634
No matter how much I dig, all I get is sand, sand, sand!

27
00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:31,834
Well, no big deal.

28
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:34,034
No need to get desperate looking for clams here

29
00:03:34,034 --> 00:03:36,534
because there doesn't seem to be many here.

30
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:38,234
Oh?

31
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:40,134
I don't think so.

32
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:47,134
Wow! There are so many clams!

33
00:03:47,134 --> 00:03:48,534
A lot.

34
00:03:48,534 --> 00:03:50,634
There are at least 20 to 30 of them.

35
00:03:50,634 --> 00:03:54,634
I hope you didn't go buy them at the fish shop.

36
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,234
There are a lot of guys like you around.

37
00:03:57,234 --> 00:03:58,734
Idiot!

38
00:03:58,734 --> 00:04:00,234
Why would I do something like that?

39
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:02,734
You need technique, a knack for digging them!

40
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:05,034
A knack for it?

41
00:04:05,034 --> 00:04:06,634
Tell me how, then.

42
00:04:06,634 --> 00:04:12,234
Listen, scrape the water's edge with the rake and make the sand soft.

43
00:04:12,234 --> 00:04:14,434
Then, after a while when the waves come...

44
00:04:20,234 --> 00:04:21,334
See?

45
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:23,934
Clams that are lighter than sand come floating.

46
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:26,334
Wow!

47
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:27,734
You're pretty good, Conan!

48
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,434
Where did you learn something like that?

49
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:31,734
It's like magic!

50
00:04:31,734 --> 00:04:35,134
Which means that you can find clams only at the water's edge?

51
00:04:35,134 --> 00:04:36,834
No, that's not it.

52
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:39,034
When clams stick out their siphons,

53
00:04:39,034 --> 00:04:42,534
the clams make little holes called "eye of the clam".

54
00:04:42,534 --> 00:04:45,334
Moreover, clams are most times huddled together, so...

55
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:48,834
Where there are a lot of those holes...

56
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:51,334
If you dig gently about 10 to 15cm below

57
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:54,834
without hurting the shell of the clams...

58
00:04:56,134 --> 00:04:57,234
See?

59
00:04:57,234 --> 00:04:59,334
There are quite a lot of them!

60
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:07,934
"Clam Digging-Sigh (Part 1)"

61
00:05:09,034 --> 00:05:11,434
See? Huh?

62
00:05:11,434 --> 00:05:14,434
Where'd they...

63
00:05:14,434 --> 00:05:16,134
If you're wondering where they are...

64
00:05:16,134 --> 00:05:18,034
They're over there.

65
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:22,934
Wow, super! They're coming out one after the other!

66
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:25,434
Talk about great catch! Genta!

67
00:05:25,434 --> 00:05:27,434
I found the "eye of the clam"!

68
00:05:27,434 --> 00:05:32,034
If we had a bigger rake, we could probably pick enough to sell.

69
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,834
We could open a fish shop!

70
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:40,134
We could make big cash! Good idea!

71
00:05:40,134 --> 00:05:41,134
Yes!

72
00:05:41,134 --> 00:05:42,834
No!

73
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:46,534
It's manners to use a rake that is within 15cm in width

74
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:51,534
and only up to about 2kg per person.

75
00:05:51,534 --> 00:05:54,434
I mean they're short-necked clams, so it's better to be "short"!

76
00:05:55,534 --> 00:05:59,234
But, is everybody following the rule?

77
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:03,234
The important thing is that each one of us keep that in mind!

78
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:04,634
Do you understand?

79
00:06:04,634 --> 00:06:07,934
Genta, you wouldn't like it either if too many eels are caught

80
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:11,334
and wouldn't be able to eat eels over rice anymore, would you?

81
00:06:14,934 --> 00:06:16,134
That would be a problem!

82
00:06:16,134 --> 00:06:18,434
I don't ever want that to happen!

83
00:06:18,434 --> 00:06:19,934
Genta.

84
00:06:20,534 --> 00:06:24,434
See, nobody else is in a rush to take a whole lot for himself, right?

85
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:27,234
The real purpose of clam digging

86
00:06:27,234 --> 00:06:30,634
is to enjoy looking for the shells that are buried under the sand.

87
00:06:30,634 --> 00:06:31,834
I see!

88
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:34,834
Yes! I understand, yes!

89
00:06:37,534 --> 00:06:41,034
It seems that there are people who aren't enjoying themselves here too.

90
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:42,334
See.

91
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:45,134
I'll bet he can't find any clams.

92
00:06:45,134 --> 00:06:47,734
Should we tell him how to look for clams?

93
00:06:47,734 --> 00:06:49,134
Yeah!

94
00:06:49,134 --> 00:06:50,134
Hey, hey!

95
00:06:50,134 --> 00:06:52,534
Do you know about the "eye of the clam"?

96
00:06:52,534 --> 00:06:53,834
Yeah.

97
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:56,034
If you dig below that hole...

98
00:06:56,034 --> 00:06:58,634
There'll be a lot of clams.

99
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:01,334
"Tsuguo Ushigome (21)" -I dug up a lot of clams already.

100
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:02,634
"College Student" -See.

101
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:09,134
Then what are you sighing for?

102
00:07:09,134 --> 00:07:11,234
Why, why?

103
00:07:11,234 --> 00:07:15,034
I've got a lot of things on my mind.

104
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:17,834
Hey, Ushigome!

105
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:19,634
We bought lunches.

106
00:07:19,634 --> 00:07:21,134
And snacks too!

107
00:07:24,534 --> 00:07:26,234
Who're these kids?

108
00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:27,534
Do you know them?

109
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:29,834
I just happened to meet them now.

110
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:31,834
Who're you guys?

111
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:34,034
We're...

112
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:36,934
Members of the same university circle, called...

113
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:39,234
Aiko-kai!

114
00:07:39,234 --> 00:07:41,934
So, what are you all devotees of?

115
00:07:41,934 --> 00:07:44,934
All four of you are wearing matching parkers.

116
00:07:45,434 --> 00:07:49,234
Are you guys planning to be comedians?

117
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:54,634
No, it's written on the back of the parker, isn't it?

118
00:07:54,634 --> 00:07:56,334
"Clam Devotees Club!"

119
00:07:56,334 --> 00:07:59,034
Clam Devotees Club?

120
00:07:59,034 --> 00:08:02,634
In others words, we love to dig for and eat clams.

121
00:08:02,634 --> 00:08:04,234
All four of us!

122
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,534
Well, this parker was made only today,

123
00:08:06,534 --> 00:08:09,034
and this is the first time we're wearing it!

124
00:08:09,034 --> 00:08:11,134
I see, the name of their club

125
00:08:11,134 --> 00:08:13,434
uses a play on words with the word clam.

126
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:17,834
Well, let's start eating, Ushigome!

127
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:20,534
Yeah, let's do that.

128
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:25,034
See!

129
00:08:25,034 --> 00:08:29,334
I bought your favorite, Ushigome.

130
00:08:31,634 --> 00:08:33,234
Hey, Ushigome!

131
00:08:33,234 --> 00:08:34,334
Huh?

132
00:08:35,034 --> 00:08:36,534
Green tea!

133
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:39,334
Here!

134
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:42,134
Oh, thanks.

135
00:08:42,134 --> 00:08:43,434
Well...

136
00:08:44,134 --> 00:08:45,634
This one?

137
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:49,134
A salmon, codfish roe and pickled apricot rice ball!

138
00:08:51,734 --> 00:08:53,134
Thank you!

139
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,534
And...

140
00:08:56,634 --> 00:08:58,434
Potato chips as a snack.

141
00:08:58,434 --> 00:08:59,834
Here you go!

142
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:02,234
Oh, thank you, thank you!

143
00:09:02,234 --> 00:09:05,034
And? How're you doing digging clams?

144
00:09:05,034 --> 00:09:07,734
Oh, I got quite a lot!

145
00:09:07,734 --> 00:09:09,734
Wow, fantastic!

146
00:09:09,734 --> 00:09:10,734
Let me see.

147
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:12,834
Just as expected of you, Ushigome!

148
00:09:15,534 --> 00:09:18,634
I'm getting kind of hungry.

149
00:09:19,634 --> 00:09:21,134
Here he goes again!

150
00:09:21,134 --> 00:09:24,234
We already ate a while ago, Genta.

151
00:09:24,234 --> 00:09:26,434
Let's go to the convenience store then.

152
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,834
Shall we go get some snacks?

153
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:33,734
Yes! I'll go buy some then!

154
00:09:34,234 --> 00:09:35,434
Mitsuhiko,

155
00:09:35,434 --> 00:09:38,134
I'll bet you're planning to buy Yaiba chocolate in secret.

156
00:09:38,134 --> 00:09:39,634
Come on, Genta...

157
00:09:39,634 --> 00:09:41,734
I'll go too!

158
00:09:41,734 --> 00:09:42,934
Here.

159
00:09:46,134 --> 00:09:48,734
Then, why don't all three of you go together?

160
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:51,834
Don't buy too many things you don't need now!

161
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:53,034
Okay?

162
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:58,434
And, be careful of cars!

163
00:09:58,434 --> 00:09:59,834
Okay!

164
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:03,534
There seems to have been a hit-and-run accident near here the other day.

165
00:10:03,534 --> 00:10:06,334
So, be really careful!

166
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:09,934
Okay!

167
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:11,534
Yes, sir!

168
00:10:12,934 --> 00:10:15,134
I wonder if they'll be okay.

169
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:18,234
Shall we start heading home?

170
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:20,134
I guess so.

171
00:10:20,134 --> 00:10:22,434
We got a lot of clams too.

172
00:10:22,434 --> 00:10:25,234
Let's have a clam party and Ushigome's house!

173
00:10:25,234 --> 00:10:26,734
Okay then, Ushigome.

174
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:29,234
We'll clean this place up

175
00:10:29,234 --> 00:10:33,034
so will you load the clams and make them spit out the sand?

176
00:10:33,034 --> 00:10:34,534
Hey, Ushigome?

177
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:39,234
Oh, that's right!

178
00:10:39,234 --> 00:10:42,934
I found this restaurant that serves good clam dishes the other day.

179
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,934
So why don't we all go there?

180
00:10:44,934 --> 00:10:46,334
Oh, sounds great!

181
00:10:46,334 --> 00:10:47,534
Let's go! Let's go!

182
00:10:47,534 --> 00:10:50,734
Then let's have a drink at that restaurant tonight.

183
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:53,034
And spend the night at Ushigome's house.

184
00:10:53,034 --> 00:10:55,734
We can put the clams that we got today in miso soup,

185
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:57,034
for breakfast tomorrow.

186
00:10:57,034 --> 00:10:59,034
Right? What do you think?

187
00:11:00,134 --> 00:11:01,334
Ushigome?

188
00:11:03,634 --> 00:11:05,234
Ushigome?

189
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,334
Yeah.

190
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:11,134
Let's do that.

191
00:11:26,434 --> 00:11:29,934
Is something wrong with him?

192
00:11:29,934 --> 00:11:32,434
He seems a little depressed.

193
00:11:33,434 --> 00:11:35,734
-Not really. -It's nothing much.

194
00:11:35,734 --> 00:11:37,434
Clean up time, clean up time.

195
00:11:37,434 --> 00:11:38,534
Right.

196
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,134
So...

197
00:11:45,034 --> 00:11:46,934
Make sure you separate the trash.

198
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:47,934
Yes, yes.

199
00:11:47,934 --> 00:11:50,934
This bag is for the plastic bottles.

200
00:11:51,734 --> 00:11:52,734
Say...

201
00:11:52,734 --> 00:11:53,734
Yes?

202
00:11:54,434 --> 00:11:55,934
Just a while ago...

203
00:11:57,534 --> 00:11:59,334
There seemed to be a change in atmosphere.

204
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:00,534
Yeah.

205
00:12:04,334 --> 00:12:06,034
Yaiba chocolates.

206
00:12:08,034 --> 00:12:09,734
Yaiba gummies.

207
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:13,634
And, Yaiba snacks!

208
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,134
What's this?

209
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:19,634
They're all snacks that involve freebies for Masked Yaiba.

210
00:12:19,634 --> 00:12:21,034
So what?

211
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:23,434
Genta insisted, so...

212
00:12:23,434 --> 00:12:26,034
No fair, Mitsuhiko!

213
00:12:26,034 --> 00:12:28,334
But, they're all good.

214
00:12:28,334 --> 00:12:31,134
By the way, the four people who were here a while ago...

215
00:12:31,134 --> 00:12:32,234
did they go home?

216
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:34,734
Yeah. Just a while ago.

217
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:38,534
They cleaned up all their trash nicely and left.

218
00:12:38,534 --> 00:12:42,334
They're pretty well-mannered for young people nowadays!

219
00:12:42,334 --> 00:12:43,534
No.

220
00:12:43,534 --> 00:12:47,034
It seems they forgot something important.

221
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:52,434
-The rake? -But, how do you know it's theirs?

222
00:12:52,434 --> 00:12:55,234
There is no name on it.

223
00:12:55,234 --> 00:13:00,034
See, there's a brand new blackish stain on the wooden handle.

224
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:01,734
This is probably a bloodstain.

225
00:13:01,734 --> 00:13:02,934
Blood?

226
00:13:03,734 --> 00:13:04,934
I see.

227
00:13:04,934 --> 00:13:07,134
The man that sighed.

228
00:13:07,134 --> 00:13:11,034
When we first met him, he had his index finger in his mouth.

229
00:13:11,034 --> 00:13:12,534
He may have cut his finger

230
00:13:12,534 --> 00:13:15,034
when he was trying to dig out a clam or something.

231
00:13:15,034 --> 00:13:18,534
You want to say that the handle of the rake go stained then, right?

232
00:13:18,534 --> 00:13:20,434
Well, sort of.

233
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:22,634
Then, they could be looking for it now.

234
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:25,934
Hey, Doc! When did the four leave?

235
00:13:25,934 --> 00:13:27,834
Like I said, just a while ago!

236
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:31,234
They might still be at the parking lot then!

237
00:13:31,234 --> 00:13:32,934
Let's take it to them then!

238
00:13:32,934 --> 00:13:34,434
Yeah.

239
00:13:34,434 --> 00:13:36,134
Let's all go.

240
00:13:36,134 --> 00:13:37,334
Yeah!

241
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:38,934
Give it to me, Conan!

242
00:13:40,234 --> 00:13:43,634
Hey! It may have been just a while ago, but it was 4 or 5 minutes ago.

243
00:13:43,634 --> 00:13:45,934
I'm sure they already left!

244
00:13:45,934 --> 00:13:48,334
The parking lot is huge.

245
00:13:48,334 --> 00:13:49,734
I'm sure they're still here!

246
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:52,534
Where are they? Where?

247
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,234
There they are!

248
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:57,434
There!

249
00:13:57,434 --> 00:13:59,434
You forgot something.

250
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:02,134
Hey!

251
00:14:28,945 --> 00:14:31,445
Clam digging?

252
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:33,345
Which means that...

253
00:14:33,345 --> 00:14:36,645
After finishing digging clams,

254
00:14:36,645 --> 00:14:39,545
while you three were cleaning up the trash, he...

255
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,545
Mr. Ushigome, came back to the car before all of you

256
00:14:41,545 --> 00:14:45,645
with the buckets of clams that you took.

257
00:14:45,645 --> 00:14:49,845
And when you all came back to the car, you found him like this.

258
00:14:52,145 --> 00:14:53,745
Yes, that's right.

259
00:14:53,745 --> 00:14:56,845
The mouth of the victim smells of almond

260
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:59,845
and judging from this bottle of green tea

261
00:14:59,845 --> 00:15:03,245
that was found on the ground beside him...

262
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:09,045
It seems that Mr. Ushigome died of poisoning by cyanic acid

263
00:15:09,045 --> 00:15:12,245
that was mixed into his green tea.

264
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,645
Which means...

265
00:15:13,645 --> 00:15:14,845
Just as I thought...

266
00:15:14,845 --> 00:15:16,245
Is it suicide?

267
00:15:16,245 --> 00:15:19,245
Oh! What do you mean by just as I thought?

268
00:15:19,245 --> 00:15:20,945
Do you have something in mind?

269
00:15:20,945 --> 00:15:23,845
It's not that.

270
00:15:23,845 --> 00:15:27,145
He seems to have been troubled over something lately.

271
00:15:27,145 --> 00:15:29,745
He wasn't all that cheerful.

272
00:15:29,745 --> 00:15:32,745
I don't know what he was troubled over though.

273
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:34,345
Shoko, do you have any idea?

274
00:15:34,345 --> 00:15:36,145
No, I don't.

275
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:39,845
But, judging from the way he was acting...

276
00:15:39,845 --> 00:15:42,145
Suicide is possible.

277
00:15:42,145 --> 00:15:44,745
I guess so.

278
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:49,845
Or taking advantage of Mr. Ushigome acting as he was,

279
00:15:49,845 --> 00:15:52,245
someone poisoned his green tea.

280
00:15:52,245 --> 00:15:55,545
Someone among you inserted poison.

281
00:15:55,545 --> 00:15:57,445
It's one or the other!

282
00:15:58,345 --> 00:15:59,645
What are you insinuating?

283
00:15:59,645 --> 00:16:02,345
We didn't do such a thing.

284
00:16:02,345 --> 00:16:03,645
And?

285
00:16:03,645 --> 00:16:06,545
Who's the one that bought this tea?

286
00:16:06,545 --> 00:16:09,045
All three of us bought it at the convenience store.

287
00:16:09,045 --> 00:16:12,345
He said that he hadn't eaten anything for breakfast so...

288
00:16:12,345 --> 00:16:14,445
We bought rice balls and snacks along with it too.

289
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:18,645
Then, did Mr. Ushigome take the green tea out of the plastic bag himself?

290
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,445
-No. -Huh?

291
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:23,845
I handed it over to him.

292
00:16:23,845 --> 00:16:28,345
But, he looked just fine for a while and was gulping down the tea.

293
00:16:28,345 --> 00:16:29,745
What about that?

294
00:16:29,745 --> 00:16:33,845
Did anybody touch the PET bottle while he was drinking from it?

295
00:16:33,845 --> 00:16:36,245
The only time we touched it is when we bought it.

296
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,945
Ushigome had it with him right through.

297
00:16:38,945 --> 00:16:40,945
I don't think anybody touched it.

298
00:16:40,945 --> 00:16:45,045
All I did was throw the rice balls at him and give it to him.

299
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,745
A salmon, codfish roe and pickled apricot rice ball!

300
00:16:50,545 --> 00:16:51,645
Thank you!

301
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:56,045
I opened a bag of potato chips and put it near him.

302
00:16:56,045 --> 00:16:57,945
But, didn't touch the green tea even once.

303
00:16:57,945 --> 00:16:59,345
Here! For you!

304
00:16:59,345 --> 00:17:01,845
Oh, thanks!

305
00:17:01,845 --> 00:17:05,045
But somebody could've done something in a really short span of time.

306
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:06,445
Oh, no.

307
00:17:06,445 --> 00:17:10,445
They're telling the truth!

308
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:12,445
I was watching all the time.

309
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:14,945
After Mr. Ushigome opened the bottle,

310
00:17:14,945 --> 00:17:18,345
nobody besides Mr. Ushigome touched it!

311
00:17:20,045 --> 00:17:23,945
Brat. You're the one that's with Smokey Kogoro all the time.

312
00:17:23,945 --> 00:17:27,345
Smokey? It's Sleeping!

313
00:17:28,345 --> 00:17:30,545
Then, don't tell me that the detective with the flimsy mustache

314
00:17:30,545 --> 00:17:32,245
is also here?

315
00:17:32,245 --> 00:17:34,245
-Where is he? -He's not here!

316
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,645
Really?

317
00:17:36,645 --> 00:17:40,345
But, my friends are here with me today!

318
00:17:40,345 --> 00:17:42,145
Conan!

319
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,745
I brought Doc!

320
00:17:46,945 --> 00:17:48,545
Please tell him too, Doc,

321
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:52,245
that Mr. Ushigome was holding his bottle of green tea all the while.

322
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:55,645
Oh, okay.

323
00:17:56,845 --> 00:18:02,145
He didn't give the bottle of tea to anyone while he was drinking it.

324
00:18:02,145 --> 00:18:05,745
Are you sure you were watching closely?

325
00:18:05,745 --> 00:18:07,045
I'm sure.

326
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,745
I met him together with the children

327
00:18:08,745 --> 00:18:11,145
for the first time today at the beach.

328
00:18:11,145 --> 00:18:15,645
But, since he was sighing all the while, I was a bit worried.

329
00:18:15,645 --> 00:18:17,045
Sighing?

330
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:18,945
Inspector!

331
00:18:18,945 --> 00:18:22,645
This bottle was found by the feet of the body!

332
00:18:26,545 --> 00:18:27,945
Is that so?

333
00:18:27,945 --> 00:18:29,445
Let me see.

334
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:34,445
Not pills but powder seems to have been inside.

335
00:18:34,445 --> 00:18:38,045
There seems have cyanic poisoning in the bottle.

336
00:18:38,045 --> 00:18:39,045
That's...

337
00:18:39,045 --> 00:18:43,345
That bottle is what Ushigome used to put supplement capsules inside.

338
00:18:43,345 --> 00:18:45,945
I hope you're telling the truth.

339
00:18:45,945 --> 00:18:47,445
No mistake about it.

340
00:18:47,445 --> 00:18:49,745
I used to see him use it all the time.

341
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:51,045
I see.

342
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:53,845
-Forensic officer! -Yes, sir!

343
00:18:53,845 --> 00:18:57,045
Please check this bottle together with the PET bottle and the cap!

344
00:18:57,045 --> 00:18:58,745
Yes, sir!

345
00:18:58,745 --> 00:19:00,645
Then, I'm counting on you.

346
00:19:00,645 --> 00:19:02,245
But at that time...

347
00:19:02,245 --> 00:19:03,845
What is it, brats?

348
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:05,945
Did you recall something that bothers you?

349
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:08,245
Oh, no. It's just...

350
00:19:08,245 --> 00:19:11,345
Will you try smiling a bit?

351
00:19:13,545 --> 00:19:15,445
What did you just say?

352
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,745
Because you look so much like him.

353
00:19:17,745 --> 00:19:21,345
The coral headed police officer that we know!

354
00:19:21,345 --> 00:19:22,645
Hi!

355
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:24,445
Hope you're all well!

356
00:19:26,145 --> 00:19:27,945
Of course they look alike!

357
00:19:27,945 --> 00:19:31,445
He's Officer Yokomizo's younger brother.

358
00:19:32,745 --> 00:19:35,245
For real?

359
00:19:35,245 --> 00:19:37,545
Come to think of it, my older brother told me that.

360
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:39,545
The boy staying with Smokey Kogoro.

361
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,045
It's Sleeping.

362
00:19:41,045 --> 00:19:42,545
The one wearing glasses...

363
00:19:42,545 --> 00:19:44,045
One wearing glasses?

364
00:19:44,045 --> 00:19:47,545
...is hanging around some kids who think they're detectives!

365
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:50,245
What? We don't think!

366
00:19:50,245 --> 00:19:52,345
We are the Youth Detective Squad!

367
00:19:52,345 --> 00:19:53,845
Right!

368
00:19:53,845 --> 00:19:56,245
His face and voice resemble his brother

369
00:19:56,245 --> 00:19:57,345
but the way he talks and his personality

370
00:19:57,345 --> 00:19:59,345
seems to be the opposite of his brother's.

371
00:19:59,345 --> 00:20:01,645
Yeah. It seems so.

372
00:20:01,645 --> 00:20:04,745
Unfortunately, I guess you, the Detective Squad's

373
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,445
not needed for this case.

374
00:20:06,445 --> 00:20:07,745
Huh?

375
00:20:07,745 --> 00:20:09,045
What do you mean?

376
00:20:09,045 --> 00:20:12,345
The situation is, that no one has touched the PET bottle,

377
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:15,145
and a container which seems to have had poison in it

378
00:20:15,145 --> 00:20:16,945
was found in the car.

379
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:20,745
Moreover, the victim was troubled enough to let out a sigh.

380
00:20:20,745 --> 00:20:22,845
So, this is undoubtedly suicide!

381
00:20:24,845 --> 00:20:27,645
So, go! You kids go on home!

382
00:20:27,645 --> 00:20:30,045
You're getting in the way!

383
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:31,845
What's the big deal, younger brother of Yokomizo?

384
00:20:31,845 --> 00:20:33,645
Let's not get stingy!

385
00:20:33,645 --> 00:20:37,245
Is this cap really the cap for that PET bottle?

386
00:20:37,245 --> 00:20:38,545
Yeah.

387
00:20:38,545 --> 00:20:41,045
This was the only cap found in the car.

388
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:44,945
Moreover, the tea on the inside of the cap is not dried yet.

389
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,945
And the brand is a match.

390
00:20:47,945 --> 00:20:49,745
But, isn't that strange?

391
00:20:49,745 --> 00:20:52,745
There's blood on the rim of the bottle where you drink from

392
00:20:52,745 --> 00:20:55,145
but there's nothing on the cap.

393
00:20:56,045 --> 00:20:57,645
True.

394
00:20:57,645 --> 00:21:01,045
What? Hey, hey, how come there was blood on it?

395
00:21:01,045 --> 00:21:02,445
I wonder.

396
00:21:02,445 --> 00:21:04,545
Oh, that's probably because...

397
00:21:04,545 --> 00:21:06,545
Ushigome...

398
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:09,945
Ushigome hurt his finger.

399
00:21:09,945 --> 00:21:11,245
Hurt?

400
00:21:11,245 --> 00:21:14,045
If so, maybe he cut his finger with a cracked shell or something

401
00:21:14,045 --> 00:21:15,845
when he was digging clams.

402
00:21:15,845 --> 00:21:19,345
I think he was digging clams with thinking of something, so...

403
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:22,445
It's probably true that he was hurt.

404
00:21:22,445 --> 00:21:26,645
When we first met him, Mr. Ushigome had his finger in his mouth.

405
00:21:26,645 --> 00:21:29,045
That's how we figured out the blood-stained rake

406
00:21:29,045 --> 00:21:33,045
that was left behind on the beach belonged to that chubby mister.

407
00:21:33,045 --> 00:21:35,345
And, came to return it to him.

408
00:21:35,345 --> 00:21:38,045
And, ended up seeing this!

409
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:44,445
I see.

410
00:21:45,245 --> 00:21:48,645
It's true that he has a cut on the index finger of his right hand.

411
00:21:48,645 --> 00:21:51,545
Although the blood looks dry.

412
00:21:51,545 --> 00:21:54,445
In other words, when he first opened the cap,

413
00:21:54,445 --> 00:21:58,145
his wound wasn't closed up yet and the cap was stained with blood.

414
00:21:58,145 --> 00:22:01,545
But, when he brought the bottle here and opened it again,

415
00:22:01,545 --> 00:22:03,545
he noticed the blood on it

416
00:22:03,545 --> 00:22:06,945
so he wiped off the blood first and then opened it again.

417
00:22:07,745 --> 00:22:12,345
But would a person who is about to commit suicide do such a thing?

418
00:22:12,345 --> 00:22:14,345
I think he wanted to leave without leaving any bad traces behind.

419
00:22:14,345 --> 00:22:16,745
He might want to die nice and clean.

420
00:22:16,745 --> 00:22:18,945
At any rate, let's wait from results from the forensic officer.

421
00:22:18,945 --> 00:22:22,345
Until then, I'll have to have you all wait.

422
00:22:22,345 --> 00:22:23,845
Yeah, okay.

423
00:22:23,845 --> 00:22:25,245
I guess we have no choice.

424
00:22:25,245 --> 00:22:26,345
Yeah.

425
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,800
Next Conan's Hint:

426
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,800
"The cap of the PET bottle"

427
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,220
Say "clam digging-sigh" three times.

428
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,220
Clam dig in sigh.
