1
00:00:03,038 --> 00:00:04,938
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:06,938
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,938 --> 00:00:08,438
Starting the year off is the Youth Detective Squad.

4
00:00:08,438 --> 00:00:10,338
Genta's rear end is more important than the monkey's rear end.

5
00:00:10,338 --> 00:00:12,138
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:13,938
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,938 --> 00:00:16,138
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,522 --> 00:02:00,922
Hey! Is it for real

9
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:03,722
that you and Haibara were almost kidnapped?

10
00:02:03,722 --> 00:02:06,922
Yes. But we somehow made it through safely.

11
00:02:06,922 --> 00:02:09,522
The kidnapper got away though.

12
00:02:09,522 --> 00:02:11,922
I'm really glad for you both!

13
00:02:11,922 --> 00:02:13,222
Since you both recovered from your cold

14
00:02:13,222 --> 00:02:15,222
and got to come to school!

15
00:02:15,222 --> 00:02:17,322
We were really worried about you!

16
00:02:17,322 --> 00:02:18,622
Thank you.

17
00:02:18,622 --> 00:02:20,222
I'm perfectly fine now.

18
00:02:20,222 --> 00:02:24,122
We actually wanted to go see you but...

19
00:02:24,122 --> 00:02:26,622
Conan insisted that we shouldn't go see you

20
00:02:26,622 --> 00:02:29,322
because we'd catch your cold. Right?

21
00:02:29,322 --> 00:02:30,322
Yes!

22
00:02:30,322 --> 00:02:32,322
Oh. Is that so?

23
00:02:32,322 --> 00:02:36,122
We even decided on what time to go see you and yet...

24
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,722
Exactly!

25
00:02:37,722 --> 00:02:40,122
Now that I'm relieved, I'm starved.

26
00:02:40,122 --> 00:02:41,322
Not again!

27
00:02:42,022 --> 00:02:43,622
Hey.

28
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,622
Are sure it's really safe?

29
00:02:45,622 --> 00:02:47,922
For me to go outside.

30
00:02:47,922 --> 00:02:49,822
Yeah, pretty much.

31
00:02:49,822 --> 00:02:52,122
For now.

32
00:02:52,122 --> 00:02:53,822
What do you mean "pretty much"?

33
00:02:53,822 --> 00:02:56,222
I removed all the wiretap that was set up

34
00:02:56,222 --> 00:02:58,722
in Dr. Agasa's house.

35
00:02:58,722 --> 00:03:03,622
In fact, I went browsing around here alone last night.

36
00:03:03,622 --> 00:03:05,322
Disguised as you.

37
00:03:06,922 --> 00:03:10,822
I asked mom to help me disguise as you once more!

38
00:03:12,122 --> 00:03:14,322
Shinichi. You look just great!

39
00:03:14,322 --> 00:03:16,122
What do you think?

40
00:03:16,122 --> 00:03:17,722
You think so.

41
00:03:17,722 --> 00:03:20,622
Doing something dangerous like that on your own again.

42
00:03:20,622 --> 00:03:22,122
There was nobody watching me

43
00:03:22,122 --> 00:03:25,322
or anybody suspicious following me.

44
00:03:25,322 --> 00:03:28,322
Well, I wouldn't say that it's completely safe,

45
00:03:28,322 --> 00:03:30,622
but I'm not the type who can stayed locked up

46
00:03:30,622 --> 00:03:32,922
just because I'm scared.

47
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:36,722
I decided to believe her words for now.

48
00:03:36,722 --> 00:03:38,822
I lost.

49
00:03:38,822 --> 00:03:41,522
I'll give up going after Sherry.

50
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:42,922
Her words?

51
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:46,222
Besides, you pretty much recovered too, haven't you?

52
00:03:46,222 --> 00:03:49,522
Isn't it because pressure from those guys disappeared?

53
00:03:53,422 --> 00:03:59,322
"Look for the Mark on the Buttocks (Part 1)"

54
00:04:01,322 --> 00:04:04,822
What? An FBI agent?

55
00:04:04,822 --> 00:04:06,222
Sonoko!

56
00:04:06,222 --> 00:04:08,322
Really?

57
00:04:08,322 --> 00:04:10,322
Sonoko.

58
00:04:10,322 --> 00:04:12,522
But! You mean Jodie is?

59
00:04:12,522 --> 00:04:14,722
-No kidding? -Sonoko!

60
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:18,222
This is a hospital! Be quiet!

61
00:04:18,222 --> 00:04:19,222
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:19,222 --> 00:04:20,522
Don't worry about it.

63
00:04:20,522 --> 00:04:23,922
Why'd you think of working as an English teacher in Japan?

64
00:04:23,922 --> 00:04:26,222
Don't tell me that you're an undercover agent investigating something?

65
00:04:26,222 --> 00:04:27,822
Sonoko...

66
00:04:27,822 --> 00:04:29,422
No. No!

67
00:04:29,422 --> 00:04:32,222
Oh. That's not it.

68
00:04:32,222 --> 00:04:34,222
There was a culprit I was after for a long time,

69
00:04:34,222 --> 00:04:36,922
but I carelessly lost track of that person.

70
00:04:36,922 --> 00:04:39,422
So, I was given time off from work for a while,

71
00:04:39,422 --> 00:04:41,322
that's why I came to Japan!

72
00:04:43,422 --> 00:04:47,822
I really love Japanese games!

73
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:50,122
-Games? -Games?

74
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:52,622
I became an English teacher,

75
00:04:52,622 --> 00:04:55,422
because I always wanted to be one for a long time!

76
00:04:55,422 --> 00:04:58,622
But, my time off has come to an end!

77
00:04:58,622 --> 00:05:00,822
As soon as the wound on my stomach heals,

78
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:03,522
I have to head back to America!

79
00:05:03,522 --> 00:05:05,122
Then, the treasure map

80
00:05:05,122 --> 00:05:07,922
you said you'd been looking for all this time is...

81
00:05:07,922 --> 00:05:10,122
I got a call from my boss telling me to come home

82
00:05:10,122 --> 00:05:11,422
because they got a clue to the culprit

83
00:05:11,422 --> 00:05:14,722
that I've been looking for!

84
00:05:14,722 --> 00:05:16,022
He said he's going to give me a chance

85
00:05:16,022 --> 00:05:17,322
to make things right again!

86
00:05:17,322 --> 00:05:19,522
I see.

87
00:05:19,522 --> 00:05:24,322
I wanted to say goodbye to cool kid before leaving too

88
00:05:24,322 --> 00:05:26,222
so I went to Dr. Agasa's house.

89
00:05:26,222 --> 00:05:28,222
That's when I saw cool kid and Ai

90
00:05:28,222 --> 00:05:31,222
being pushed into the car and taken away

91
00:05:31,222 --> 00:05:32,722
by some suspicious looking people,

92
00:05:32,722 --> 00:05:34,322
so I went after them with my car!

93
00:05:38,622 --> 00:05:40,722
And I cornered them by a pier.

94
00:05:40,722 --> 00:05:43,522
They suddenly fired a gun at me.

95
00:05:43,522 --> 00:05:46,722
So, I did likewise!

96
00:05:47,822 --> 00:05:50,322
Of course, the gun was what I had taken

97
00:05:50,322 --> 00:05:52,722
from the suspicious people!

98
00:05:52,722 --> 00:05:54,422
But, I was definitely lucky!

99
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:58,022
That Mouri was hiding in the trunk of the car.

100
00:05:58,022 --> 00:06:00,122
And that she protected Ai.

101
00:06:00,122 --> 00:06:03,222
Because back then, I was shot in the stomach

102
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:05,922
and couldn't move.

103
00:06:05,922 --> 00:06:08,622
Moreover, the kidnappers were planning

104
00:06:08,622 --> 00:06:12,722
to give up kidnapping and kill the children!

105
00:06:12,722 --> 00:06:14,122
Really?

106
00:06:14,122 --> 00:06:15,222
Yes.

107
00:06:15,222 --> 00:06:19,322
I found the pictures of Conan and Shinichi hidden and pasted

108
00:06:19,322 --> 00:06:22,822
behind the mirror in the restroom of Jodie's condominium.

109
00:06:22,822 --> 00:06:26,922
So I went to Jodie's place to ask her about them.

110
00:06:26,922 --> 00:06:30,022
But, she wasn't home so I was ready to leave

111
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:33,622
when I saw her car in front of her condominium.

112
00:06:33,622 --> 00:06:36,122
The trunk of the car was open so I took the liberty of...

113
00:06:36,122 --> 00:06:39,322
So, you took the liberty of... I mean you know.

114
00:06:41,522 --> 00:06:43,222
But I'm sure glad

115
00:06:43,222 --> 00:06:46,622
that you weren't a bad person after all, Jodie!

116
00:06:46,622 --> 00:06:49,622
I mean, I thought that you were involved in some way

117
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:50,922
with the case that Shinichi is involved in.

118
00:06:50,922 --> 00:06:52,622
And that you were being threatened by the culprit

119
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:53,822
to take pictures of Shinichi

120
00:06:53,822 --> 00:06:57,922
to find out what his weaknesses were.

121
00:06:57,922 --> 00:06:59,722
I had every mind to confront the culprit directly

122
00:06:59,722 --> 00:07:01,422
and beat him up.

123
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,922
Hey, Ran! Are you serious?

124
00:07:03,922 --> 00:07:06,822
I mean the things you think of are so unreal!

125
00:07:06,822 --> 00:07:08,922
Oh! Those pictures that are pasted there

126
00:07:08,922 --> 00:07:13,022
are people that I've befriended in Japan!

127
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:14,222
What?

128
00:07:14,222 --> 00:07:17,922
I actually had them pasted on the living room board,

129
00:07:17,922 --> 00:07:20,122
but when one of my Japanese friends came over,

130
00:07:20,122 --> 00:07:22,122
she had a queer look on her face

131
00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:24,522
so I decided to move the pictures over to where they are now!

132
00:07:24,522 --> 00:07:25,722
I see!

133
00:07:25,722 --> 00:07:28,522
Americans often have pictures of their families

134
00:07:28,522 --> 00:07:32,022
all over the desk at their work place too.

135
00:07:32,022 --> 00:07:34,622
It's not too customary to do something like that in Japan

136
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:37,222
so I guess it's only natural that it would be thought of as odd.

137
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:40,722
Come to think of it, even when I went to watch an opera in New York.

138
00:07:40,722 --> 00:07:43,022
The actresses had a lot of pictures pasted all over the mirror

139
00:07:43,022 --> 00:07:46,322
of their dressing room.

140
00:07:46,322 --> 00:07:47,622
You mean the time when you and Shinichi

141
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:50,722
were attacked by the serial killer!

142
00:07:50,722 --> 00:07:52,122
Take care.

143
00:07:52,122 --> 00:07:56,022
Because I've heard that they appear in this area recently too!

144
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:58,122
-We will. -We will.

145
00:07:59,822 --> 00:08:02,622
Somebody's here.

146
00:08:02,622 --> 00:08:06,522
I guess we'd better be going then.

147
00:08:06,522 --> 00:08:08,922
I hope you get well soon, Jodie!

148
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,822
Thank you so much, both of you!

149
00:08:10,822 --> 00:08:12,222
-Please excuse us. -Please excuse us.

150
00:08:15,122 --> 00:08:17,822
How are you doing?

151
00:08:17,822 --> 00:08:19,622
All right, somehow...

152
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:22,922
the shot fortunately missed my vital point.

153
00:08:22,922 --> 00:08:24,922
By the way, were the Japanese police

154
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,222
convinced with the explanation we gave them?

155
00:08:27,222 --> 00:08:28,322
Yeah.

156
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:29,722
After hearing the siren of the police car,

157
00:08:29,722 --> 00:08:34,622
one of the kidnappers took the boy hostage and fled.

158
00:08:34,622 --> 00:08:38,422
Then he disappeared leaving the car and the boy behind in the forest.

159
00:08:38,422 --> 00:08:41,222
The other one whose leg was fractured

160
00:08:41,222 --> 00:08:43,722
committed suicide with the gun he had on him.

161
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:45,122
Unfortunately,

162
00:08:45,122 --> 00:08:47,022
since it was the dark, neither you nor the children

163
00:08:47,022 --> 00:08:50,622
could see the face of the kidnapper who fled.

164
00:08:50,622 --> 00:08:55,322
Of course I made both children say the same thing.

165
00:08:55,322 --> 00:08:59,822
I didn't want to create a sensation by publicizing that

166
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:03,122
the kidnapper was actress Chris Vineyard after we failed to arrest her

167
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:05,822
on top of not knowing what the actual motive of the kidnapping was.

168
00:09:05,822 --> 00:09:09,122
We also felt bad about making you work undercover here

169
00:09:09,122 --> 00:09:12,922
without acquiring permission from the Japanese police, so...

170
00:09:12,922 --> 00:09:18,522
The problem is that girl who was called Sherry by that woman.

171
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:25,522
I wonder if she'll accept

172
00:09:25,522 --> 00:09:27,522
our request?

173
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:34,822
Well, it seems like the FBI is in on this too

174
00:09:34,822 --> 00:09:38,322
so I'm sure they can't make any moves that easily either!

175
00:09:38,322 --> 00:09:39,522
Come to think of it,

176
00:09:39,522 --> 00:09:42,322
Dr. Agasa said that you got a phone call from Jodie

177
00:09:42,322 --> 00:09:43,622
this morning.

178
00:09:43,622 --> 00:09:45,922
What did she want?

179
00:09:45,922 --> 00:09:50,022
Was it to verify whether we didn't contradict each other?

180
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:52,622
Well, I guess so.

181
00:09:54,822 --> 00:09:57,122
I'll be frank with you.

182
00:09:57,122 --> 00:10:01,522
We would like you to accept the witness protection program.

183
00:10:01,522 --> 00:10:03,922
Back then, Chris Vineyard.

184
00:10:03,922 --> 00:10:07,322
Yes. The lady called Vermouth,

185
00:10:07,322 --> 00:10:10,522
tried to kill you to keep you from talking.

186
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:12,422
In other words, it's obvious that

187
00:10:12,422 --> 00:10:17,422
you have information that she finds very inconvenient.

188
00:10:17,422 --> 00:10:19,622
About the witness protection program,

189
00:10:19,622 --> 00:10:22,222
I think you already know it from movies and novels.

190
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:25,322
It will change everything from your name, background and address

191
00:10:25,322 --> 00:10:27,522
to a totally different identity

192
00:10:27,522 --> 00:10:29,222
in order to protect you

193
00:10:29,222 --> 00:10:31,722
from the people who are after your life.

194
00:10:31,722 --> 00:10:33,122
You will be guaranteed sufficient income

195
00:10:33,122 --> 00:10:36,722
and other miscellaneous things from the country for life

196
00:10:36,722 --> 00:10:39,522
and I will see to it that you get to live a happy life.

197
00:10:39,522 --> 00:10:42,722
Of course whether you want to accept this or not is up to you.

198
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:44,022
However, once you accept it,

199
00:10:44,022 --> 00:10:48,922
you will not be able to see or call your family and friends.

200
00:10:48,922 --> 00:10:52,622
If you're afraid of that woman coming after you in revenge,

201
00:10:52,622 --> 00:10:56,822
if you don't want to get your friends involved,

202
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,722
I'll be waiting for you to give me a good answer.

203
00:11:00,022 --> 00:11:01,622
What's up Haibara?

204
00:11:01,622 --> 00:11:04,522
Maybe because of her cold.

205
00:11:04,522 --> 00:11:06,022
No, that's not it.

206
00:11:06,022 --> 00:11:07,822
It's been a while since I came outside,

207
00:11:07,822 --> 00:11:10,022
so I'm just a bit tired.

208
00:11:10,022 --> 00:11:12,122
Then, bye. Because I'm going this way.

209
00:11:12,122 --> 00:11:13,422
See you tomorrow!

210
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,922
I'll see you at school!

211
00:11:14,922 --> 00:11:16,122
Okay!

212
00:11:21,622 --> 00:11:23,622
"I feel great."

213
00:11:23,622 --> 00:11:28,122
"Splashing in the rain."

214
00:11:41,522 --> 00:11:43,322
It hurts...

215
00:11:44,922 --> 00:11:46,622
Serial Killer!

216
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,722
Somebody, get him!

217
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:55,622
It's Ayumi's voice.

218
00:12:06,222 --> 00:12:08,922
-What's up? -Ayumi!

219
00:12:08,922 --> 00:12:10,122
Ayumi?

220
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,102
I see.

221
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:21,302
So, you don't remember that person's face.

222
00:12:21,302 --> 00:12:22,702
Yes.

223
00:12:22,702 --> 00:12:27,302
It was raining and he was wearing my raincoat and hat.

224
00:12:27,302 --> 00:12:30,802
Besides, I was so scared I couldn't look at the person's face!

225
00:12:30,802 --> 00:12:33,002
Even the lady victim who got her armed slashed

226
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,102
didn't see the culprit's face.

227
00:12:36,202 --> 00:12:38,302
Judging from the way things look,

228
00:12:38,302 --> 00:12:39,502
the culprit is probably the same as the one

229
00:12:39,502 --> 00:12:41,702
who committed the other three previous cases.

230
00:12:41,702 --> 00:12:43,902
But, the outfit is different.

231
00:12:43,902 --> 00:12:46,202
I heard the person shout.

232
00:12:46,202 --> 00:12:48,202
I'm sure it was a man!

233
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,802
But, you can't really tell just from a shouting voice.

234
00:12:52,802 --> 00:12:53,902
Either way,

235
00:12:53,902 --> 00:12:57,402
let's go to the scene of the crime and do an inspection!

236
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,202
Maybe you'll remember something.

237
00:13:00,202 --> 00:13:01,202
Okay!

238
00:13:02,102 --> 00:13:05,102
I bumped into the serial killer over here.

239
00:13:05,102 --> 00:13:07,502
We heard Ayumi scream

240
00:13:07,502 --> 00:13:09,502
so we came running over!

241
00:13:09,502 --> 00:13:12,402
Which means that the culprit ran away

242
00:13:12,402 --> 00:13:13,802
because you and the others came?

243
00:13:13,802 --> 00:13:15,702
No!

244
00:13:15,702 --> 00:13:18,102
He ran away before that!

245
00:13:18,102 --> 00:13:19,302
Really?

246
00:13:19,302 --> 00:13:22,602
Before he ran away, he came towards me once,

247
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:23,902
so I was surprised but...

248
00:13:23,902 --> 00:13:25,202
He came towards you?

249
00:13:25,202 --> 00:13:26,202
Yep!

250
00:13:26,202 --> 00:13:28,602
I heard a clinking sound afterwards

251
00:13:28,602 --> 00:13:30,902
so I'm sure he picked something up!

252
00:13:30,902 --> 00:13:33,802
Maybe he dropped loose change or something?

253
00:13:33,802 --> 00:13:37,202
Maybe it was his glasses or house key.

254
00:13:37,202 --> 00:13:41,202
It could've been a necklace or bracelet.

255
00:13:41,202 --> 00:13:44,602
Do you know what the culprit picked up?

256
00:13:44,602 --> 00:13:45,902
No.

257
00:13:45,902 --> 00:13:49,602
I think it has something to do with the number 5!

258
00:13:49,602 --> 00:13:51,302
The number 5?

259
00:13:51,302 --> 00:13:54,102
Because there's a mark that looks like the number 5

260
00:13:54,102 --> 00:13:56,802
on the palm of my hand!

261
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:59,202
I looked around the area after that

262
00:13:59,202 --> 00:14:01,102
but I saw nothing on the ground.

263
00:14:01,102 --> 00:14:03,102
Can you draw a picture of the mark for me?

264
00:14:03,102 --> 00:14:04,502
Yes, I can.

265
00:14:08,002 --> 00:14:10,102
It looked like this.

266
00:14:10,102 --> 00:14:14,502
It doesn't look like a 50 yen coin or a 500 yen coin either.

267
00:14:14,502 --> 00:14:18,002
It kind of looks like the letter S of the alphabet too.

268
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:21,202
Well, I'll try go look for traces of this mark.

269
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:25,102
It could be a mark left behind by some coin

270
00:14:25,102 --> 00:14:27,702
from a slot machine game center or something.

271
00:14:31,602 --> 00:14:33,002
There he is!

272
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:35,002
-What? -Why you!

273
00:14:36,102 --> 00:14:37,102
Excuse us!

274
00:14:37,102 --> 00:14:38,802
Don't let him get away!

275
00:14:42,802 --> 00:14:45,102
Darn it! It's so hard to get through with so many onlookers.

276
00:14:45,102 --> 00:14:47,402
There he is! The man in the raincoat!

277
00:14:47,402 --> 00:14:50,102
There's the serial killer.

278
00:14:51,402 --> 00:14:52,802
Wait! That's...

279
00:14:52,802 --> 00:14:54,502
Why you...

280
00:14:57,902 --> 00:14:59,602
It's Officer Takagi.

281
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:05,002
Geez! She's right, it's Officer Takagi.

282
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:06,202
It hurts...

283
00:15:06,202 --> 00:15:08,402
What a thing to do.

284
00:15:08,402 --> 00:15:09,902
Hey, Officer Takagi.

285
00:15:09,902 --> 00:15:13,102
Didn't a man wearing a raincoat come running this way?

286
00:15:13,102 --> 00:15:16,202
There are so many of them here.

287
00:15:16,202 --> 00:15:18,702
Because it just stopped raining.

288
00:15:18,702 --> 00:15:20,502
But, how bold.

289
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,002
To come back wearing a raincoat to the site of the crime,

290
00:15:23,002 --> 00:15:25,102
knowing that the police are conducting investigations.

291
00:15:25,102 --> 00:15:26,102
Yeah.

292
00:15:26,102 --> 00:15:29,402
The culprit probably thinks that no one would expect him

293
00:15:29,402 --> 00:15:31,302
to come back in the same clothes.

294
00:15:31,302 --> 00:15:33,802
Don't tell me that he came back to take revenge thinking

295
00:15:33,802 --> 00:15:35,402
that Ayumi had seen his face?

296
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:37,202
No way.

297
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:39,002
He probably came back because he was positive

298
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:40,402
that she didn't see his face!

299
00:15:40,402 --> 00:15:42,702
For what?

300
00:15:42,702 --> 00:15:44,202
Beats me.

301
00:15:44,202 --> 00:15:45,602
He may have forgotten something at the site

302
00:15:45,602 --> 00:15:48,002
that he shouldn't have left behind.

303
00:15:48,002 --> 00:15:49,902
Or, maybe he came back to confirm something.

304
00:15:49,902 --> 00:15:53,402
Darn it. I'm all wet.

305
00:15:53,402 --> 00:15:55,702
At any rate, we'll have to figure out

306
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:58,002
what this mark that Ayumi drew is.

307
00:15:58,002 --> 00:15:59,602
Hey!

308
00:16:00,402 --> 00:16:02,302
Genta?

309
00:16:02,302 --> 00:16:04,402
Your buttocks, Genta.

310
00:16:04,402 --> 00:16:06,502
What? Is it ripped or something?

311
00:16:06,502 --> 00:16:08,102
That's not it!

312
00:16:08,102 --> 00:16:10,602
The mark that the serial killer left behind is there!

313
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:13,002
What? No kidding?

314
00:16:13,002 --> 00:16:16,902
That means he must've come in contact with the culprit somewhere.

315
00:16:16,902 --> 00:16:19,902
Genta, please try and remember!

316
00:16:19,902 --> 00:16:21,402
Where were you?

317
00:16:23,502 --> 00:16:25,702
Please answer, Genta!

318
00:16:25,702 --> 00:16:27,702
Where did you get that mark on?

319
00:16:27,702 --> 00:16:31,302
The mark of the serial killer that is on your buttocks!

320
00:16:31,302 --> 00:16:34,502
I wonder if this is really a mark left behind by the serial killer?

321
00:16:34,502 --> 00:16:35,602
Yes!

322
00:16:35,602 --> 00:16:39,402
It looks just like the mark on the thing that the culprit dropped!

323
00:16:39,402 --> 00:16:42,002
I coincidentally pressed my hand against it,

324
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,102
when the culprit got flustered,

325
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,802
came back to get it and then fled.

326
00:16:44,802 --> 00:16:48,402
After that, the same mark was left on the palm of my hand.

327
00:16:48,402 --> 00:16:51,202
Which means that Kojima touched the culprit

328
00:16:51,202 --> 00:16:54,202
or the culprit's belongings somewhere along the line.

329
00:16:54,202 --> 00:16:56,702
It could've been when you went after the culprit

330
00:16:56,702 --> 00:16:59,202
who was among the crowd

331
00:16:59,202 --> 00:17:01,502
and wearing a raincoat, went fleeing!

332
00:17:01,502 --> 00:17:03,802
But...

333
00:17:03,802 --> 00:17:07,002
Although I did trip over the bag of somebody in the crowd,

334
00:17:07,002 --> 00:17:09,502
staggered and bumped into a bicycle,

335
00:17:09,502 --> 00:17:11,602
it wasn't the culprit!

336
00:17:11,602 --> 00:17:13,502
Besides...

337
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:18,202
It's nothing.

338
00:17:18,202 --> 00:17:22,202
Could it be that the mark that was on the bag and the bicycle

339
00:17:22,202 --> 00:17:25,802
were the same as the mark on the culprit's belongings?

340
00:17:25,802 --> 00:17:30,202
If so, it could've been a name brand item.

341
00:17:30,202 --> 00:17:31,902
Let's go back to the site

342
00:17:31,902 --> 00:17:34,302
and ask the people in the area!

343
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:36,402
Besides the owners of the bag and the bicycle

344
00:17:36,402 --> 00:17:38,402
may still be there.

345
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:44,502
Officer Sato...

346
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:46,402
Yes.

347
00:17:46,402 --> 00:17:48,002
Come on, Conan. Let's go!

348
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:49,602
Yeah.

349
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:51,102
It's strange.

350
00:17:51,102 --> 00:17:55,202
-The mark that is on Genta's buttocks. -The mark...

351
00:17:55,202 --> 00:17:56,502
looks familiar.

352
00:17:58,802 --> 00:18:00,302
Oh! There!

353
00:18:00,302 --> 00:18:03,402
I tripped over this man's bag!

354
00:18:03,402 --> 00:18:06,702
But there's nothing that looks like that mark on the bag.

355
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:09,302
Besides, the bag isn't dirty at all

356
00:18:09,302 --> 00:18:11,102
so I don't think this is the one.

357
00:18:11,102 --> 00:18:13,402
Because the mark on Genta's buttocks

358
00:18:13,402 --> 00:18:15,302
looked to be soiled with mud.

359
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,102
If he was soiled with mud,

360
00:18:17,102 --> 00:18:19,202
maybe the bicycle is a better bet?

361
00:18:19,202 --> 00:18:21,202
And, where is that bicycle?

362
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,502
There she is!

363
00:18:24,502 --> 00:18:25,802
She's the lady!

364
00:18:28,502 --> 00:18:31,202
It's true that it is soiled with mud but...

365
00:18:31,202 --> 00:18:34,102
The mark doesn't seem to be there.

366
00:18:34,102 --> 00:18:36,302
Where on earth did you get

367
00:18:36,302 --> 00:18:39,402
that number 5 or the letter S looking mark on you?

368
00:18:39,402 --> 00:18:42,102
It's neither a 5 nor a S.

369
00:18:42,102 --> 00:18:43,802
The mark that is on the palm of Ayumi's hand

370
00:18:43,802 --> 00:18:46,002
and Genta's buttocks

371
00:18:46,002 --> 00:18:49,002
is a reverse and mirrored image of the actual shape.

372
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,502
In other words, the actual shape

373
00:18:50,502 --> 00:18:53,402
is a shape that is the opposite of the number 5 or letter S.

374
00:18:53,402 --> 00:18:54,902
Oh, I see!

375
00:18:54,902 --> 00:18:57,602
And what about the size of the mark?

376
00:18:57,602 --> 00:19:01,702
If that something left this big a mark on Ayumi's palm,

377
00:19:01,702 --> 00:19:04,102
I think that she would have an idea of what it is.

378
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:07,602
No. Mine was much smaller!

379
00:19:07,602 --> 00:19:10,902
It was here. About the size of a one yen coin!

380
00:19:10,902 --> 00:19:16,602
Which means that the two were the same mark on separate things.

381
00:19:16,602 --> 00:19:18,402
If it was that small,

382
00:19:18,402 --> 00:19:21,302
it could've been an accessory of the same brand.

383
00:19:21,302 --> 00:19:22,602
Mirrored image.

384
00:19:22,602 --> 00:19:25,402
Accessory.

385
00:19:25,402 --> 00:19:27,202
The mark on the sleeve.

386
00:19:27,202 --> 00:19:29,102
Don't tell me that...

387
00:19:32,802 --> 00:19:34,402
Officer Sato?

388
00:19:37,002 --> 00:19:39,002
This! It's this mark!

389
00:19:40,202 --> 00:19:41,702
The car...

390
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:43,002
Yes.

391
00:19:43,002 --> 00:19:44,302
After I drove through a muddy road,

392
00:19:44,302 --> 00:19:45,502
I didn't wash the car

393
00:19:45,502 --> 00:19:47,002
so those traces were left behind.

394
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:50,902
Come to think of it, you were sitting on the hood of Officer Sato's car,

395
00:19:50,902 --> 00:19:52,602
weren't you, Genta?

396
00:19:52,602 --> 00:19:54,202
Yeah...

397
00:19:54,202 --> 00:19:56,502
Why didn't you tell us right away?

398
00:19:56,502 --> 00:19:59,602
Well, it crossed my mind to begin with

399
00:19:59,602 --> 00:20:01,202
but I didn't say anything.

400
00:20:01,202 --> 00:20:04,502
But I thought it can't be...

401
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:08,202
that Officer Sato was a serial killer!

402
00:20:08,202 --> 00:20:11,202
I'm not!

403
00:20:11,202 --> 00:20:15,602
The culprit probably has the same model car as I do!

404
00:20:15,602 --> 00:20:18,702
Then, the mark that was on my palm...

405
00:20:18,702 --> 00:20:21,702
Is the key to the car of this model!

406
00:20:21,702 --> 00:20:24,302
The car's master key that has a cover

407
00:20:24,302 --> 00:20:26,302
with the mark etched on it.

408
00:20:26,302 --> 00:20:27,802
See!

409
00:20:27,802 --> 00:20:29,102
No kidding!

410
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:32,602
As proof of it, look at the tip of Ayumi's sleeve!

411
00:20:32,602 --> 00:20:35,402
See the zigzag vertical lines on it?

412
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:38,102
-Yes. -True.

413
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:41,402
That's probably because there was dirt on the tip of the key

414
00:20:41,402 --> 00:20:42,602
and when it was pressed against her hand,

415
00:20:42,602 --> 00:20:45,502
traces of it stuck on to the tip of her sleeve...

416
00:20:45,502 --> 00:20:47,702
No, it's not dirt.

417
00:20:47,702 --> 00:20:50,902
It's discolored and black, but this is...

418
00:20:50,902 --> 00:20:52,402
Blood?

419
00:20:52,402 --> 00:20:57,102
Maybe the reason why the culprit came back here is...

420
00:20:57,102 --> 00:20:58,402
Yes.

421
00:20:58,402 --> 00:21:03,402
Probably to check whether Ayumi saw this mark.

422
00:21:03,402 --> 00:21:05,802
And after seeing our undercover police car,

423
00:21:05,802 --> 00:21:07,702
the culprit probably figured out that

424
00:21:07,702 --> 00:21:09,802
it would be a matter of time before everything is disclosed.

425
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:13,202
Then, we'd better hurry or the culprit will get away!

426
00:21:13,202 --> 00:21:15,802
Officer Takagi, get a hold of Inspector Megure

427
00:21:15,802 --> 00:21:17,802
and have him set up a cordon!

428
00:21:17,802 --> 00:21:21,802
Check all the drivers that are driving cars with the same mark

429
00:21:21,802 --> 00:21:23,302
that are trying to leave this area!

430
00:21:23,302 --> 00:21:24,802
Yes!

431
00:21:24,802 --> 00:21:27,402
Also check all the residents in this area

432
00:21:27,402 --> 00:21:30,302
who own the same car model!

433
00:21:30,302 --> 00:21:32,702
If the culprit is a person who will risk coming back to confirm

434
00:21:32,702 --> 00:21:35,502
whether the model of his car had been specified,

435
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:40,102
it's likely that he has a parking space or storeroom nearby!

436
00:21:40,102 --> 00:21:41,902
Okay!

437
00:21:41,902 --> 00:21:45,502
But, what if there are many cars like it?

438
00:21:45,502 --> 00:21:47,302
It'd be very hard looking for it.

439
00:21:47,302 --> 00:21:50,702
No, I don't think there are that many.

440
00:21:50,702 --> 00:21:54,602
The model of this car with this mark on the key

441
00:21:54,602 --> 00:21:57,102
and body is pretty old and manufacturing of it

442
00:21:57,102 --> 00:21:58,902
stopped about seven or eight years ago.

443
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:01,202
Besides, it was raining when the crime was committed.

444
00:22:01,202 --> 00:22:02,602
If we were to search for a culprit whose car is wet in the rain,

445
00:22:02,602 --> 00:22:06,102
with no alibi and who has lost his master key,

446
00:22:06,102 --> 00:22:08,302
the criteria for the search would be drastically narrowed down.

447
00:22:08,302 --> 00:22:11,102
Why doesn't the culprit have the master key?

448
00:22:11,102 --> 00:22:13,202
He probably had it but dropped it.

449
00:22:13,202 --> 00:22:16,102
A blood stain in the shape of a key

450
00:22:16,102 --> 00:22:18,202
was left on the sleeve of Ayumi's outfit.

451
00:22:18,202 --> 00:22:21,502
This serves as proof that the culprit grabbed the key with hands

452
00:22:21,502 --> 00:22:24,502
soiled with the blood of the victim and fled!

453
00:22:24,502 --> 00:22:28,602
This means that the culprit will not show the police the key,

454
00:22:28,602 --> 00:22:31,602
which he knows will display haematological response!

455
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:34,071
Next Conan's Hint:

456
00:24:34,071 --> 00:24:36,171
"Key cylinder"

457
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:37,771
-The next episode... -Genta's buttocks...

458
00:24:37,771 --> 00:24:39,371
-Stop it! -Genta's buttocks...

459
00:24:39,371 --> 00:24:41,071
Genta's buttocks
