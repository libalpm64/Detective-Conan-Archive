1
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,890
Satan!

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,190
The devil.

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,490
What? The devil?

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,590
But there are still two keywords left.

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,890
It's still too soon to conclude that it's the devil.

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,390
But the remaining two are...

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,190
"A long-nosed wizard living in a castle"

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,490
and "Pierce through the white back with two swords." Right?

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,090
They sound eerie even before looking for the keyword.

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,590
As for the long-nosed wizard living in a castle,

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,290
I've figured out where it is!

12
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,590
The long nose is the elephant!

13
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,290
Then, for the word castle...

14
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,790
There's a district called Elephant & Castle in London,

15
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,290
so will you try going there for me!

16
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,490
But, where do I go when I get there?

17
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,990
Well, I guess you can start with the station or something.

18
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,490
Okay! I'll try going to Elephant & Castle Station!

19
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,190
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

20
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,690
You must be true to yourself.

21
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,590
The target that emerges beyond the code.

22
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,590
Who is the culprit's target?

23
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,090
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,990
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,390
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:02:49,976 --> 00:02:54,476
An eerie coded paper awaited us when we got to London.

27
00:02:54,476 --> 00:02:57,176
It was a forewarning of a crime

28
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,676
that would be committed by Hades Sabara

29
00:02:58,676 --> 00:03:00,276
a vicious killer who was on the run.

30
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:05,076
Each sentence of the code

31
00:03:05,076 --> 00:03:07,976
indicated a characteristic building in London.

32
00:03:07,976 --> 00:03:09,476
And in each place,

33
00:03:09,476 --> 00:03:12,976
hints that appeared in Holmes' novels were left behind.

34
00:03:14,176 --> 00:03:16,976
The hint was a letter of the alphabet one at a time.

35
00:03:16,976 --> 00:03:19,076
We continued to decipher the code

36
00:03:19,076 --> 00:03:22,176
and got hold of five letters.

37
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:23,976
There are only two more letters left.

38
00:03:25,376 --> 00:03:27,076
You just wait, Hades!

39
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:29,076
I'll decipher the code at all cost

40
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,576
and prevent you from committing the crime!

41
00:03:35,076 --> 00:03:40,876
"Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (Code Break)"

42
00:03:41,476 --> 00:03:43,576
"Elephant and Castle Station" -Well...

43
00:03:43,576 --> 00:03:47,076
we came to the station and looked for close to an hour,

44
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:49,276
but we've come up with nothing!

45
00:03:50,676 --> 00:03:54,376
Shinichi. Are you sure it's here?

46
00:03:54,376 --> 00:03:58,376
Yeah. I'm sure the place is right, but...

47
00:03:58,376 --> 00:04:01,976
It could be the shopping mall in the same district.

48
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,876
Hey.

49
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:06,776
That man...

50
00:04:06,776 --> 00:04:08,376
He's been going back and forth

51
00:04:08,376 --> 00:04:10,776
since we've come here, hasn't he?

52
00:04:10,776 --> 00:04:12,576
True.

53
00:04:12,576 --> 00:04:14,376
Hey, Shinichi!

54
00:04:14,376 --> 00:04:16,976
The briefcase that the man is holding

55
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:19,976
has written in large letters the word "identity!"

56
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:21,476
That's probably...

57
00:04:21,476 --> 00:04:25,776
"A Case of Identity", a title of Holmes' story,

58
00:04:25,776 --> 00:04:28,576
with the Japanese title, "Disappearance of the Flower Lady".

59
00:04:28,576 --> 00:04:30,776
Please ask that man.

60
00:04:33,176 --> 00:04:35,276
It seems that he was paid by someone

61
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:37,276
who told him to stay in front of station

62
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:40,676
looking the same and walk around.

63
00:04:40,676 --> 00:04:42,876
He says that the empty case and the clothes he's wearing

64
00:04:42,876 --> 00:04:45,276
were all given to him by this person.

65
00:04:45,276 --> 00:04:46,976
His clothes too?

66
00:04:48,476 --> 00:04:50,676
When I look at a woman,

67
00:04:50,676 --> 00:04:52,776
the first thing I look closely at are the sleeves.

68
00:04:52,776 --> 00:04:53,776
In the case of men,

69
00:04:53,776 --> 00:04:55,876
you should probably look at the knees of his trousers.

70
00:04:57,176 --> 00:04:58,776
The knees of his trousers!

71
00:04:58,776 --> 00:05:00,276
Look at the knees of the man!

72
00:05:00,276 --> 00:05:03,676
Huh? The knees?

73
00:05:03,676 --> 00:05:06,176
But there's nothing written there.

74
00:05:06,176 --> 00:05:08,076
-Then, flip his trousers up! -What?

75
00:05:08,076 --> 00:05:09,776
-What? -What are you doing?

76
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:12,376
Hey, hey. What are you doing here?

77
00:05:12,376 --> 00:05:13,576
I found it!

78
00:05:13,576 --> 00:05:15,776
On the back of the trousers by the knee part!

79
00:05:15,776 --> 00:05:18,076
It's the letter "U"!

80
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:25,376
So, now we've got T, N, A, A, S, U.

81
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:29,076
The only code left then, is, "Finish everything off.

82
00:05:29,076 --> 00:05:34,476
Pierce the white back with two swords." The last sentence.

83
00:05:34,476 --> 00:05:38,076
The thing that bothers me is "the white back" and "two swords".

84
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:39,376
There aren't anything shaped like that,

85
00:05:39,376 --> 00:05:41,676
or a building or place with that kind of name.

86
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,776
I see! It's this!

87
00:05:49,676 --> 00:05:52,476
It's the mark of the porcelain maker!

88
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:55,676
"Pierce the white back with two swords"

89
00:05:55,676 --> 00:05:58,576
was referring to the mark of the two swords on the dish

90
00:05:58,576 --> 00:06:00,676
that is famous for its whiteness!

91
00:06:00,676 --> 00:06:03,976
Then, are you saying that you want us to go to the store in London

92
00:06:03,976 --> 00:06:05,276
where that maker's things are next?

93
00:06:05,276 --> 00:06:08,076
Mother used to go to that store a lot!

94
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,776
Mother loves the dishes of that maker.

95
00:06:11,776 --> 00:06:14,576
And there's only one store in London that carries things of that maker!

96
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,576
What? A strange decoration?

97
00:06:17,576 --> 00:06:19,976
Yep. I asked the salesclerk and was told that

98
00:06:19,976 --> 00:06:22,576
they were bothered because someone would come

99
00:06:22,576 --> 00:06:24,676
and put a strange decoration on the sign of the store.

100
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:27,376
What kind of decoration is it?

101
00:06:27,376 --> 00:06:30,576
There is a bell on the tip of strings of various colors.

102
00:06:30,576 --> 00:06:34,176
There seems to be one letter on each of the bells.

103
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:35,776
There are words that look to be a title too

104
00:06:35,776 --> 00:06:38,476
on the part where the strings are bunched together.

105
00:06:38,476 --> 00:06:41,176
But it's soiled and I can't make it out.

106
00:06:41,176 --> 00:06:43,376
The title is probably...

107
00:06:43,376 --> 00:06:46,176
"A Study in Scarlet."

108
00:06:46,176 --> 00:06:48,376
It's the very first novel,

109
00:06:48,376 --> 00:06:50,276
that Conan Doyle wrote of Sherlock Holmes',

110
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:54,376
"A Study in Scarlet" -bringing him into this world!

111
00:06:54,376 --> 00:06:56,576
Take the scarlet string from the bunch.

112
00:06:56,576 --> 00:07:00,376
In other words, find a bright red string!

113
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:03,776
Holmes' dialogue in that story goes like this.

114
00:07:03,776 --> 00:07:06,276
"There's a scarlet thread of murder

115
00:07:06,276 --> 00:07:09,476
mixed among the colorless skein of life.

116
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:13,376
Our duty is to unravel it, isolate it

117
00:07:13,376 --> 00:07:14,476
and expose every inch of it,

118
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:17,776
under the light of the sun as soon as possible."

119
00:07:17,776 --> 00:07:20,176
I found it, the red thread!

120
00:07:20,176 --> 00:07:22,276
The letter "R" is written on the bell

121
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,976
that's attached to that string!

122
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:27,776
If the "R" is the final letter, it means

123
00:07:27,776 --> 00:07:35,676
that the keywords are the seven letters, T, N, A, A, S, U, R.

124
00:07:35,676 --> 00:07:38,576
If the five letter make out the word "Satan",

125
00:07:38,576 --> 00:07:41,276
what about the other two letters, U and R?

126
00:07:44,076 --> 00:07:46,076
Hey, Shinichi?

127
00:07:46,076 --> 00:07:49,076
It seems that only one "A" is necessary.

128
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:51,576
-Huh? -The order of the letters is...

129
00:07:51,576 --> 00:07:58,276
"Saturn".

130
00:07:58,276 --> 00:07:59,776
Planet Saturn!

131
00:07:59,776 --> 00:08:01,576
Therefore, the culprit's probably

132
00:08:01,576 --> 00:08:04,476
planning to do something on Saturday.

133
00:08:04,476 --> 00:08:06,176
Saturday...

134
00:08:06,176 --> 00:08:08,676
Hey, that's tomorrow?

135
00:08:08,676 --> 00:08:10,476
Hold it...

136
00:08:10,476 --> 00:08:11,876
If it were in Japanese,

137
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:13,176
I can see that you'd come up with the word "Saturday"

138
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:14,676
because of the kanji character used to write it,

139
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:20,076
but you don't write it like that in English, do you?

140
00:08:20,076 --> 00:08:22,176
The etymology of Saturn

141
00:08:22,176 --> 00:08:26,676
comes from the agricultural god of Roman mythology, Saturnus.

142
00:08:26,676 --> 00:08:29,576
Saturnus' day became Saturday

143
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:33,176
and Saturnus is pronounced "Saturn" in English.

144
00:08:33,176 --> 00:08:35,276
Is that so?

145
00:08:35,276 --> 00:08:38,876
But, where on Saturday is it going to happen?

146
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:40,576
Apollo!

147
00:08:40,576 --> 00:08:42,476
It sounds Apollo!

148
00:08:42,476 --> 00:08:43,776
Mom!

149
00:08:43,776 --> 00:08:45,976
How did you know I was here?

150
00:08:45,976 --> 00:08:49,076
The solution of the code brought me here.

151
00:08:49,076 --> 00:08:52,476
The last sentence might hint this boutique.

152
00:08:52,476 --> 00:08:55,376
See, I told you so, Ares.

153
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:59,776
Yes, you deserve to be a Sherlockian.

154
00:08:59,776 --> 00:09:03,776
Now, we are going back to the hotel!

155
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:07,276
Tomorrow, we are going to watch Minerva's game!

156
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:08,676
Not now!

157
00:09:08,676 --> 00:09:10,776
Leave solving the code to us,

158
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:12,776
and you go home to your mama, sonny!

159
00:09:12,776 --> 00:09:14,576
But...

160
00:09:14,576 --> 00:09:18,576
Hey, your mother says we're all going to go cheer,

161
00:09:18,576 --> 00:09:20,976
but if I remember correctly, weren't your mother's eyes...

162
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:23,976
She can't see, but she can tell by sounds!

163
00:09:23,976 --> 00:09:25,376
"Juno Grass (45), MG's mother" -That's why mother always...

164
00:09:25,376 --> 00:09:27,176
comes only to the finals!

165
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:29,076
She makes sure to come

166
00:09:29,076 --> 00:09:30,476
"Ales Ashley (30), MG's ex-coach" -because big sis lost

167
00:09:30,476 --> 00:09:32,676
at French Open Tennis Finals last year, since mother wasn't there.

168
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:36,776
Apollo, be an angel and jump in the car!

169
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,576
Though I broke all of the codes,

170
00:09:39,576 --> 00:09:43,476
I can't find out what and where it will happen!

171
00:09:43,476 --> 00:09:45,976
Of course, you can't.

172
00:09:47,876 --> 00:09:50,976
Because you didn't break them.

173
00:09:51,876 --> 00:09:56,076
Now, I gave you a chance.

174
00:09:56,076 --> 00:10:01,476
It's your fault that you can't stop my final revenge

175
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:05,076
since you couldn't read my revelations.

176
00:10:06,276 --> 00:10:09,076
Curse your incompetence.

177
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:15,376
Holmes' apprentice is on your side, right?

178
00:10:15,376 --> 00:10:17,276
He'll make it clear.

179
00:10:18,376 --> 00:10:21,376
Holmes' apprentice?

180
00:10:23,376 --> 00:10:25,376
No kidding.

181
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,930
"The following day" -Really, talk about easygoing...

182
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,730
Today is Saturday.

183
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,330
There may be a massacre somewhere here in London

184
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,330
and they go walking with their dog.

185
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,630
You notified Scotland Yard

186
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:51,330
that the code was deciphered to mean "Saturday", didn't you?

187
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,430
Yep. The seven code sentences

188
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,330
each indicate buildings or places.

189
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:02,130
And in every place one keyword letter is hidden.

190
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,630
When you connect the letters together,

191
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,630
the word "Saturn" came up, so it's Saturday!

192
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,930
I went on to explain that therefore,

193
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,830
the culprit may be planning to carry something

194
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,830
out on Saturday, but...

195
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,830
I was asked which Saturday is it?

196
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:17,830
And the person hung up the phone after telling me

197
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,130
that unless I can give him what's going to happen where,

198
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,730
there's nothing he can do.

199
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,730
Didn't that detective kid say anything?

200
00:11:24,897 --> 00:11:28,197
Shinichi said, he had to go investigate a different case,

201
00:11:28,197 --> 00:11:30,497
so that he'd leave the rest up to us.

202
00:11:30,497 --> 00:11:33,197
Leave the rest up to us...

203
00:11:33,197 --> 00:11:35,797
I mean, we solved the last hint that was left to solve

204
00:11:35,797 --> 00:11:39,797
and found out that something's going to happen on Saturday.

205
00:11:39,797 --> 00:11:41,697
What else does he want us to do anyway?

206
00:11:41,697 --> 00:11:47,797
Maybe the code isn't completely deciphered yet.

207
00:11:47,797 --> 00:11:52,397
Because there's only one letter "A" in the keyword Saturn.

208
00:11:52,397 --> 00:11:56,097
Maybe there's another reason why Big Ben

209
00:11:56,097 --> 00:11:58,697
where the letter A was found, came out twice?

210
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:01,497
Conan! Is your cold okay, already?

211
00:12:01,497 --> 00:12:04,697
Yep! Although I'm still coughing a bit...

212
00:12:05,697 --> 00:12:09,997
What's with this guy called Hades Sabara, anyway?

213
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:13,797
Why's he handing out coded warnings of a crime?

214
00:12:13,797 --> 00:12:16,697
Maybe he loves the attention he's getting.

215
00:12:16,697 --> 00:12:20,597
In the past when he bombed the hospital,

216
00:12:20,597 --> 00:12:23,497
he also sent out a coded warning of the crime he was going to commit.

217
00:12:23,497 --> 00:12:25,197
After he blew up the hospital,

218
00:12:25,197 --> 00:12:26,497
it seems that he sent the police

219
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:30,397
a video tape of the scene and all.

220
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:31,497
He seems to have also included

221
00:12:31,497 --> 00:12:34,497
a letter of explanation of the code back then.

222
00:12:34,497 --> 00:12:36,197
I see.

223
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:40,097
It's like he's saying "catch me if you can".

224
00:12:40,097 --> 00:12:43,497
If so, we'd better figure out the real meaning of the code

225
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:45,297
and report it to the police.

226
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:48,897
And we better be really careful!

227
00:12:48,897 --> 00:12:50,797
At the time of the 2nd hospital,

228
00:12:50,797 --> 00:12:52,897
the code was somehow deciphered

229
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,897
but the hospital seems to have blown up

230
00:12:55,897 --> 00:12:57,797
right after the bomb squad charged inside.

231
00:12:57,797 --> 00:12:59,197
What?

232
00:12:59,197 --> 00:13:00,797
Which means that he's going to carry out whatever he plans to do,

233
00:13:00,797 --> 00:13:02,397
whether we solve the code or not!

234
00:13:02,397 --> 00:13:03,997
It seems that the video tape taken at that time

235
00:13:03,997 --> 00:13:06,397
was also sent to the police!

236
00:13:06,397 --> 00:13:08,697
They say that Hades' voice saying, "Too late"

237
00:13:08,697 --> 00:13:10,697
was also included in the video.

238
00:13:11,497 --> 00:13:15,797
That's why in order to keep him from carrying out the crime,

239
00:13:15,797 --> 00:13:17,897
we've to decipher the code accurately,

240
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,897
secretly go over to the place indicated,

241
00:13:19,897 --> 00:13:22,497
sneak up to him and then nab him.

242
00:13:22,497 --> 00:13:25,897
If I remember correctly, the City Hall and Gherkins are...

243
00:13:25,897 --> 00:13:29,497
standing confronting each other, with the Thames between them.

244
00:13:29,497 --> 00:13:30,897
When you went to the place

245
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:32,297
that was indicated by the code,

246
00:13:32,297 --> 00:13:35,297
didn't you see anyone suspicious?

247
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:37,597
A suspicious person?

248
00:13:37,597 --> 00:13:38,997
Come to think of it,

249
00:13:38,997 --> 00:13:42,197
there was a woman wearing sunglasses.

250
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,497
Could it be...

251
00:13:43,497 --> 00:13:46,797
Did she look like this?

252
00:13:46,797 --> 00:13:50,197
She's an expert on explosives that's helping Hades out.

253
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,897
I can't really say for sure.

254
00:13:53,897 --> 00:13:56,297
I see! A balloon!

255
00:13:56,297 --> 00:13:58,997
Maybe that Hades guy is planning to attach a bomb to a balloon

256
00:13:58,997 --> 00:14:01,797
and let it fly off?

257
00:14:01,797 --> 00:14:03,797
First, it takes off from the first Big Ben

258
00:14:03,797 --> 00:14:05,797
that is in the coded sentence.

259
00:14:05,797 --> 00:14:07,097
Then it'll fly by Elephant and Castle Station

260
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,897
that's mentioned in the 2nd sentence.

261
00:14:08,897 --> 00:14:11,197
Then on to City Hall in the 3rd sentence.

262
00:14:11,197 --> 00:14:14,097
After that, it'll cross the Thames,

263
00:14:14,097 --> 00:14:16,497
pass through Gherkins in the fourth sentence,

264
00:14:16,497 --> 00:14:18,897
over to St. Bride Church that is in the fifth sentence,

265
00:14:18,897 --> 00:14:20,497
and go pass it.

266
00:14:20,497 --> 00:14:23,397
Then, back to Big Ben in the sixth sentence.

267
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:25,497
Finally to the last sentence...

268
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,597
If a line is drawn from the store

269
00:14:27,597 --> 00:14:30,097
that sells chinaware on Walton Ave...

270
00:14:30,097 --> 00:14:32,297
See, look!

271
00:14:34,497 --> 00:14:37,097
It looks just like a balloon!

272
00:14:37,097 --> 00:14:39,697
Big Ben came out twice in the coded sentence

273
00:14:39,697 --> 00:14:42,397
because a line had to be drawn in the order

274
00:14:42,397 --> 00:14:44,997
as indicated in the coded sentence!

275
00:14:46,597 --> 00:14:51,597
Rather, than a balloon... I think that's...

276
00:14:51,597 --> 00:14:52,597
Don't tell me that...

277
00:14:53,597 --> 00:14:56,097
Excuse me.

278
00:14:56,097 --> 00:14:58,897
We're looking for this man. Have you seen him?

279
00:14:58,897 --> 00:14:59,997
I'm sorry?

280
00:14:59,997 --> 00:15:04,397
He seems to have entered the toilet that you came out of.

281
00:15:04,397 --> 00:15:06,197
Who is this man?

282
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:10,797
He's known to be the mass murderer terrifying the people in London.

283
00:15:10,797 --> 00:15:14,797
And he seems to have changed his appearance to this.

284
00:15:14,797 --> 00:15:18,697
Sorry, I haven't seen him!

285
00:15:18,697 --> 00:15:20,797
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.

286
00:15:22,897 --> 00:15:25,397
Oh, he won't be around here.

287
00:15:25,397 --> 00:15:27,897
Yeah, I guess so.

288
00:15:27,897 --> 00:15:29,997
Incompetent fools.

289
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:31,597
Just as I thought,

290
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,497
nobody even comes close to my level.

291
00:15:39,097 --> 00:15:42,097
It's a bit of a throw off that I get no resistance,

292
00:15:42,097 --> 00:15:43,297
but this is the last thing I have to do

293
00:15:43,297 --> 00:15:45,597
to take revenge for mother.

294
00:15:45,597 --> 00:15:48,097
It's not bad ending it all quietly.

295
00:15:48,097 --> 00:15:51,297
Yes, for my mother's sake.

296
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:53,497
I'll hush this place up.

297
00:15:53,497 --> 00:15:55,397
This place that echoes with cheer.

298
00:15:59,097 --> 00:16:02,597
This Wimbledon Center Court.

299
00:16:02,597 --> 00:16:03,797
This...

300
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,397
Hades Sabara will...

301
00:16:08,497 --> 00:16:11,197
What? A tennis racket?

302
00:16:11,197 --> 00:16:13,497
-Not a balloon? -Yep!

303
00:16:13,497 --> 00:16:16,797
It's true that it's a little crooked,

304
00:16:16,797 --> 00:16:18,997
but it does sort of look like a racket.

305
00:16:18,997 --> 00:16:22,397
Hey, hey. When you refer to racket in London...

306
00:16:22,397 --> 00:16:24,097
The Wimbledon!

307
00:16:24,097 --> 00:16:27,397
Minerva is competing in the finals today at 14:00!

308
00:16:27,397 --> 00:16:31,297
But, wasn't the Wimbledon ruled out?

309
00:16:31,297 --> 00:16:32,397
Yep.

310
00:16:32,397 --> 00:16:36,197
If the culprit told all the children that he gave the coded paper

311
00:16:36,197 --> 00:16:38,697
to that "Someone would die right in front of their eyes",

312
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,497
I thought it wasn't Wimbledon.

313
00:16:40,497 --> 00:16:42,597
Taking into consideration that the police are not

314
00:16:42,597 --> 00:16:45,597
on their guard of a massacre about to happen yet.

315
00:16:45,597 --> 00:16:48,997
He probably relayed those words only to Apollo.

316
00:16:48,997 --> 00:16:51,497
He passed out the same paper with coded sentences to other children

317
00:16:51,497 --> 00:16:55,197
just to confuse the police.

318
00:16:55,197 --> 00:16:57,897
If somebody's going to die in front of Apollo,

319
00:16:57,897 --> 00:17:02,797
the culprit may be after the finals of the Wimbledon.

320
00:17:02,797 --> 00:17:06,297
But, why is the Wimbledon?

321
00:17:06,297 --> 00:17:08,497
Maybe it has something to do with tennis.

322
00:17:08,497 --> 00:17:11,597
The culprit gave Apollo the paper with the codes

323
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,297
at the Wimbledon grounds too.

324
00:17:13,297 --> 00:17:16,497
That something is maybe the bookie?

325
00:17:16,497 --> 00:17:19,997
Hades' mother passed away of a heart disease

326
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,697
in July last year.

327
00:17:21,697 --> 00:17:23,397
It seems that a month before

328
00:17:23,397 --> 00:17:27,097
that Hades bet on a certain match through a bookie and lost.

329
00:17:27,097 --> 00:17:28,297
Come to think of it,

330
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,497
Minerva lost at the French Open last year.

331
00:17:31,497 --> 00:17:34,197
The finals back then was in June, wasn't it?

332
00:17:34,197 --> 00:17:38,397
If I remember correctly, she won all the matches she entered

333
00:17:38,397 --> 00:17:40,597
except for those she skipped because of injury.

334
00:17:40,597 --> 00:17:43,097
So, if Hades tried to make just a little more cash

335
00:17:43,097 --> 00:17:44,797
for his mother's surgery,

336
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:51,097
and bet a great sum of money on her sure-win game...

337
00:17:51,097 --> 00:17:52,797
And if he lost the bet, lost a great sum of money,

338
00:17:52,797 --> 00:17:54,697
and couldn't pay for his mother's surgery,

339
00:17:54,697 --> 00:17:55,697
which resulted in her death...

340
00:17:55,697 --> 00:17:59,197
Then, don't tell me that the culprit is after...

341
00:17:59,197 --> 00:18:02,597
Grass Queen, Minerva Grass!

342
00:18:13,897 --> 00:18:16,597
I wonder if she's okay.

343
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:19,997
Yep! She'll win for sure since you're here, mother!

344
00:18:19,997 --> 00:18:22,297
But, are you sure you really don't mind

345
00:18:22,297 --> 00:18:24,497
always sitting in the general seat here?

346
00:18:24,497 --> 00:18:27,697
No. I don't like the family seats.

347
00:18:29,397 --> 00:18:31,597
The TV stations will zoom me,

348
00:18:31,597 --> 00:18:33,697
because they know I can't see the match.

349
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:35,597
If Minerva sees this while she's competing,

350
00:18:35,597 --> 00:18:39,197
it'll distract her, wouldn't it?

351
00:18:39,197 --> 00:18:41,497
Well, though it seems that

352
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:42,697
she always seems to find where I am,

353
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:45,497
by the time the match ends.

354
00:18:45,497 --> 00:18:48,197
But it's really disappointing

355
00:18:48,197 --> 00:18:49,897
that this match will be the last one

356
00:18:49,897 --> 00:18:51,797
I'll be watching with you.

357
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:56,297
After all, I thought you were going to be my son-in-law.

358
00:18:56,297 --> 00:18:58,597
I took your husband away from you,

359
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:01,197
and I can't possibly also take your daughter from you too.

360
00:19:01,197 --> 00:19:04,897
Is it true that you're going to be someone else's coach?

361
00:19:04,897 --> 00:19:09,497
Yeah. So it'll be difficult to see you all.

362
00:19:09,497 --> 00:19:11,097
Well, it'll work out.

363
00:19:11,097 --> 00:19:13,197
Your sister can work things out on her own

364
00:19:13,197 --> 00:19:14,997
without me already.

365
00:19:16,097 --> 00:19:17,797
Hey, hey.

366
00:19:17,797 --> 00:19:19,897
It's after 14:00 already!

367
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:21,697
The match has already started!

368
00:19:21,697 --> 00:19:25,497
But, what do you propose to do when you get to Wimbledon?

369
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,497
We don't even have tickets.

370
00:19:27,497 --> 00:19:31,197
We'll just have to do something about it somehow!

371
00:19:31,197 --> 00:19:33,197
Do something somehow...

372
00:19:33,197 --> 00:19:35,097
How about it? Conan.

373
00:19:35,097 --> 00:19:36,697
Did you get a hold of Apollo?

374
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:40,497
No. Maybe his cell phone is switched off

375
00:19:40,497 --> 00:19:42,097
because he's watching the match.

376
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,797
Hello?

377
00:19:43,797 --> 00:19:46,497
-Apollo! -Just what were you doing?

378
00:19:46,497 --> 00:19:48,697
Not contacting me at all!

379
00:19:48,697 --> 00:19:51,197
Sorry. Where are you now?

380
00:19:51,197 --> 00:19:54,097
I couldn't talk in the spectator's seat,

381
00:19:54,097 --> 00:19:55,697
so I came out to the corridor.

382
00:19:55,697 --> 00:19:58,697
Since you're calling me,

383
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:02,797
did you catch the culprit who gave me the coded letter?

384
00:20:02,797 --> 00:20:04,397
No, not yet.

385
00:20:04,397 --> 00:20:06,597
Then, don't call me now!

386
00:20:06,597 --> 00:20:09,897
I'm watching big sis play, you know!

387
00:20:09,897 --> 00:20:13,897
And, did anything out of the ordinary happen over there?

388
00:20:13,897 --> 00:20:16,097
Like somebody talking to you or something.

389
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:18,697
Yeah, the fans of big sis told me

390
00:20:18,697 --> 00:20:20,897
to hang in there and encouraged me!

391
00:20:20,897 --> 00:20:23,997
Everybody knows the faces of mother, Ales and I,

392
00:20:23,997 --> 00:20:28,297
so I also got a big stuffed doll for sis!

393
00:20:28,297 --> 00:20:30,497
How does your sister look like she's doing?

394
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:32,297
How she's doing?

395
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:34,497
Like always I guess.

396
00:20:34,497 --> 00:20:37,597
The match has just started.

397
00:20:37,597 --> 00:20:40,797
But, why are you asking those questions?

398
00:20:40,797 --> 00:20:43,297
Don't tell me that something's going to happen here?

399
00:20:45,397 --> 00:20:48,397
No, it's not that.

400
00:20:48,397 --> 00:20:51,797
We decided that we wanted to watch your sister's match too.

401
00:20:51,797 --> 00:20:54,297
Do you happen to have any extra tickets?

402
00:20:54,297 --> 00:20:55,597
Extra?

403
00:20:56,097 --> 00:20:58,497
"Wimbledon Front Gate" -Well, I guess not.

404
00:20:58,497 --> 00:21:00,497
No tickets are available, I'm sure.

405
00:21:00,497 --> 00:21:02,897
And we're already by the gate.

406
00:21:02,897 --> 00:21:04,697
We know that a vicious criminal

407
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:07,897
is among the crowd inside and yet...

408
00:21:07,897 --> 00:21:10,997
Darn it! I guess I just have to...

409
00:21:10,997 --> 00:21:12,397
Hey, hey.

410
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:15,197
Oh, Sleeping Detective!

411
00:21:16,497 --> 00:21:18,497
Are you here for the game?

412
00:21:18,497 --> 00:21:20,797
Diana!

413
00:21:20,797 --> 00:21:23,197
I forgot our tickets!

414
00:21:23,197 --> 00:21:25,297
Can you help me with this?

415
00:21:26,497 --> 00:21:28,597
How about this idea?

416
00:21:33,897 --> 00:21:35,697
I see.

417
00:21:35,697 --> 00:21:36,997
As long as we have admission tickets,

418
00:21:36,997 --> 00:21:39,397
even though we can't get inside the center court,

419
00:21:39,397 --> 00:21:43,097
we can watch the finals on this huge screen here!

420
00:21:43,097 --> 00:21:45,897
So, this is the famous Murray Mound!

421
00:21:45,897 --> 00:21:48,097
We were sure lucky though,

422
00:21:48,097 --> 00:21:51,697
that Diana has influence over the Steering Committee here,

423
00:21:51,697 --> 00:21:55,297
and was able to immediately get tickets for us.

424
00:21:55,297 --> 00:21:57,897
Well, but as expected, we weren't able to push our luck

425
00:21:57,897 --> 00:22:00,897
as far as to get tickets for the Center Court, though.

426
00:22:02,097 --> 00:22:05,397
Who the heck is she? That old lady...

427
00:22:05,397 --> 00:22:08,497
And, how's the match going?

428
00:22:08,497 --> 00:22:11,997
It seems that Minerva's not in mint condition.

429
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,597
All her serves are touching the net

430
00:22:14,597 --> 00:22:17,097
and she's losing with a score of 3-1.

431
00:22:20,097 --> 00:22:21,297
Let!

432
00:22:21,297 --> 00:22:23,197
First service!

433
00:22:26,697 --> 00:22:29,397
Please... somebody...

434
00:22:32,097 --> 00:22:34,597
Anybody, help...

435
00:22:35,997 --> 00:22:37,397
Help me...

436
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,797
Holmes!

437
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,360
Next Conan's Hint:

438
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,860
"A stuffed bear"

439
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,980
I'll stop you no matter what.

440
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:41,200
Am I talking to myself?
