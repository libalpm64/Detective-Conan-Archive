1
00:00:04,825 --> 00:00:09,725
"I pledge to clean up Japan once and for all."

2
00:00:09,725 --> 00:00:12,825
So, whose words are these?

3
00:00:12,825 --> 00:00:13,993
Huh?

4
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:17,425
It sounds awfully familiar but I wonder who it was.

5
00:00:17,425 --> 00:00:19,325
Ryoma Sakamoto!

6
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:25,525
In the 3rd year of Bunkyu, 1863 June 29th,

7
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,325
it was written in the letter

8
00:00:27,325 --> 00:00:29,525
that Ryoma sent to his older sister, Otome.

9
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:34,013
Wow. You're so knowledgeable, Conan.

10
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:36,015
I mean, I saw it on TV.

11
00:00:37,225 --> 00:00:41,225
But, why would you be quoting Ryoma's words, Sonoko?

12
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:43,225
The Ryoma Exhibition's being held

13
00:00:43,225 --> 00:00:48,025
at Uncle Jirokichi's Suzuki Museum since last week.

14
00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:52,025
And, a forewarning of a crime letter was sent there...

15
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:53,525
by my beloved.

16
00:00:54,425 --> 00:00:58,037
Sir Thief Kid, you see!

17
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,043
"You see?" You say in the Tosa dialect.

18
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:06,045
Right!

19
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:08,725
I was checking up on Ryoma and got all into it.

20
00:01:08,725 --> 00:01:11,725
But I don't think there's anything at the Ryoma Exhibition

21
00:01:11,725 --> 00:01:14,053
that Kid would be interested in stealing.

22
00:01:14,225 --> 00:01:18,325
He does! The gunbelt that Ryoma is said to have been given

23
00:01:18,325 --> 00:01:20,325
by Shinsaku Takasugi together with the pistol!

24
00:01:20,325 --> 00:01:22,425
Gunbelt?

25
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:24,063
Right!

26
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:28,625
It's a gorgeous belt with a large ruby embedded by the buckle!

27
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:30,625
Is it real?

28
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:34,725
There's also a letter that Ryoma wrote regarding the belt.

29
00:01:34,725 --> 00:01:38,425
It seems to have been authenticated by a famous appraiser too!

30
00:01:38,425 --> 00:01:40,525
Well, I guess it's genuine

31
00:01:40,525 --> 00:01:43,025
because Uncle Jirokichi got it after all!

32
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:46,825
No, it seems he couldn't get hold of it.

33
00:01:46,825 --> 00:01:48,625
The person who wanted to feature that belt

34
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:51,225
and hold an exhibition

35
00:01:51,225 --> 00:01:53,825
wouldn't agree to sell it to him for quite some time.

36
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:55,325
So, Uncle having no other choice, told that person that

37
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:57,625
if he was going to hold a Ryoma Exhibition, do it here

38
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,525
and agreed to lend him the museum.

39
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:04,425
But, like... Kid is after it too.

40
00:02:04,425 --> 00:02:07,825
Oh, well, it's actually not what it looks to be.

41
00:02:07,825 --> 00:02:09,225
Hey.

42
00:02:11,225 --> 00:02:13,125
Like the fog clears.

43
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,225
Lets see through love and crime as well!

44
00:02:15,225 --> 00:02:17,025
A forewarning of crime letter unlike the usual.

45
00:02:17,025 --> 00:02:18,925
Thief Kid fights for the treasure!

46
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:20,725
He sees through the one and only truth.

47
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:22,825
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

48
00:02:22,825 --> 00:02:25,425
His name is Detective Conan!

49
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:12,231
"Conan vs. Kid Battle for the Treasures of Ryoma (Part 1)"

50
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:16,235
What? He's coming to return something he stole?

51
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:20,239
You mean it was written in Kid's letter?

52
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,909
Yeah.

53
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:24,709
"There are three things I would like to return"

54
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:26,809
"to the Ryoma Exhibition that is currently being held."

55
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:29,209
"So, I shall appear in a few days."

56
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:31,309
"Thief Kid."

57
00:04:31,309 --> 00:04:33,709
Three things?

58
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:37,509
It seems that this man, Mr. Shishihiko Tarumi

59
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:40,909
held a Ryoma Exhibition some 20 years ago too

60
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:43,909
and things were stolen back then.

61
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:47,009
On the night before Ryoma was assassinated,

62
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:50,269
an unfinished letter he wrote to his wife, Oryu.

63
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:53,909
An Omiya goblet with his blood that splattered on it

64
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:55,709
when he was assassinated.

65
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:59,809
And, the Smith & Wesson pistol's first model

66
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:03,109
that he had hidden in his pocket.

67
00:05:03,109 --> 00:05:06,609
But those things were stolen not by Kid,

68
00:05:06,609 --> 00:05:08,287
-if I remember correctly... -No.

69
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:13,009
The woman who was rumored to be the 20 faces of the Showa era,

70
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:16,309
the woman thief, Phantom Lady!

71
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:20,299
I don't know what kind of relationship Kid had with Lady

72
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:22,009
but after stealing the three items,

73
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:23,909
Lady quit committing crimes

74
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:27,509
and Kid appeared two years after that,

75
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:31,809
so they could've been teacher and student.

76
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:34,709
And? When is he coming?

77
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,709
I wonder. All it says in the letter is, in the near future.

78
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:41,209
Then, cancel the Ryoma Exhibition right away

79
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:42,809
and chase all the people out!

80
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,109
Without a definite date,

81
00:05:44,109 --> 00:05:45,209
it's disadvantageous for us who are on guard,

82
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:46,809
and it may work out exactly as he planned!

83
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:48,809
If he's just going to come and return the goods,

84
00:05:48,809 --> 00:05:51,109
he could easily do so by mingling among the crowd!

85
00:05:51,109 --> 00:05:54,333
But, Mr. Nakamori.

86
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,009
I mean, he's coming all this way just to return the items.

87
00:05:57,009 --> 00:05:58,337
Why should we object?

88
00:05:58,337 --> 00:06:01,909
Oh, well, but Superintendent...

89
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:04,343
Besides, in order to nab Kid,

90
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:07,409
we'd first have to invite him in, wouldn't we?

91
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:11,209
Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki who received the letter, was also saying,

92
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:14,353
"The entrance should be wide but the exit narrow."

93
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:17,209
He said that this is the fundamental of catching rats.

94
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:20,359
"The Great Suzuki Museum" -Uncle!

95
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:21,809
Long time no see!

96
00:06:21,809 --> 00:06:25,009
Oh! I haven't seen you since the iron raccoon incident.

97
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,365
Hello.

98
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:29,809
There's quite a long line of people, isn't there?

99
00:06:29,809 --> 00:06:31,009
Yeah.

100
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:32,371
Well, in addition to the popularity of Ryoma,

101
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:35,309
the letter was delivered from Kid too, so...

102
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:38,377
Well, if I were the host,

103
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:42,009
I would've advertised the event using leaflets, and TV commercials

104
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:45,209
and gather several times more than the people who are here!

105
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:50,389
But, isn't it unusual?

106
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:52,391
That you would lend your museum space out to someone

107
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:55,209
other than yourself.

108
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:57,609
I didn't think of doing so, at first,

109
00:06:57,609 --> 00:07:01,009
but I just couldn't let an amateur take care of this situation

110
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:03,209
knowing that Kid would be coming to steal.

111
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:04,403
An amateur?

112
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:09,209
Yes, the one who is hosting this Ryoma Exhibition called Tarumi

113
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:12,411
held exhibitions every time something got popular,

114
00:07:12,609 --> 00:07:16,415
be it the Gikyo Exhibition, or the Nobunaga Exhibition,

115
00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:18,417
but because of sloppy security, he's been attacked by thief after thief

116
00:07:18,609 --> 00:07:21,909
and something is stolen each time.

117
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:25,709
Then, you should've bought Ryoma's gunbelt!

118
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:27,609
Did he ask for an exorbitant amount or something?

119
00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:31,709
No, on the contrary, I actually got a super discount.

120
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:35,609
He wouldn't let me show it to our appraiser before buying it

121
00:07:35,609 --> 00:07:38,437
so I'm not even sure if it's genuine or not.

122
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:42,109
But, it's been appraised already by a famous appraiser, hasn't it?

123
00:07:42,109 --> 00:07:44,443
Well, yes.

124
00:07:44,609 --> 00:07:46,445
But, I've got my doubts

125
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:48,447
about whether we can really fish Kid with it.

126
00:07:48,609 --> 00:07:52,009
But, you did get to fish Kid, didn't you?

127
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:56,455
Though it seems that he was not really after the gunbelt.

128
00:07:56,455 --> 00:07:58,809
That gunbelt is genuinely

129
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:02,461
what was given to Ryoma by Shinsaku Takasugi!

130
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:05,509
Right? Master Hanamura.

131
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:07,309
"Masanosuke Hanamura (63), Appraiser" -Indeed.

132
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:09,309
Judging from the condition of the leather,

133
00:08:09,309 --> 00:08:11,509
it is surely vintage.

134
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:14,473
The ruby on the buckle is splendid too.

135
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:15,609
Moreover, Ryoma himself

136
00:08:15,609 --> 00:08:19,309
has drawn an explanatory diagram of that belt too.

137
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:22,009
It can be none other than genuine.

138
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:24,483
Masanosuke Hanamura.

139
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:26,485
He's got a good eye for sure,

140
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:28,487
but he charges an exorbitant amount for appraisal,

141
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:31,909
and rarely takes on any appraisal work.

142
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:34,809
If you would like to, do you want me to show you girls

143
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:37,509
the real thing with your very eyes?

144
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:40,499
Although it's still before opening time, I'll show it just to you.

145
00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:47,209
Oh, so this is Ryoma's gunbelt!

146
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:49,609
This really has a kind of existence to it, doesn't it?

147
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:53,709
The picture of the belt is really drawn on the letter.

148
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:56,209
But I can't read the words.

149
00:08:56,209 --> 00:09:00,509
-True. -In the past, men of America

150
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:04,523
used to carry this thing called a gunbelt on their hips.

151
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:07,609
It is the holder for a gun and the bullets to be put away.

152
00:09:07,609 --> 00:09:09,809
In other words, it is like the sheath of a sword

153
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:11,909
wrapped around the hips by a belt.

154
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:16,535
It is a wonder that none of the current New Yorkers

155
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:21,709
are wearing such an interesting thing on them.

156
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:23,209
That's what it says.

157
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:25,209
I guess Ryoma would say something like that!

158
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:27,009
Yes, true!

159
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:32,209
Hey.

160
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:34,109
What's that big jar?

161
00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:36,555
Oh, that's...

162
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:38,009
It's a jar that is said to be something

163
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:39,509
that Ryoma hid inside when he was a child

164
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:44,309
and got into trouble because he couldn't come out of it.

165
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:45,309
Other things include

166
00:09:45,309 --> 00:09:48,309
the statue of the Buddha that Roma saw and complimented on

167
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:52,571
and the "kendama" that Ryoma is said to have wanted too.

168
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:54,209
In other words, anything goes...

169
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:57,309
Oh, could this hanging scroll be...

170
00:09:57,309 --> 00:09:59,709
It's a hanging scroll that he impulsively wrote

171
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:02,309
when grieving over the corrupted government.

172
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:03,309
Just as I thought.

173
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:07,209
Well, but it's doubtful whether that's genuine too.

174
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:09,009
True.

175
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:12,591
If you will go as far to doubt the judgment of my eyes,

176
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:14,593
after the Ryoma Exhibition is over,

177
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:17,609
I'll agree to show it to your appraiser for appraisal then.

178
00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:19,809
Oh! I couldn't ask for better!

179
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:24,609
That is of course, if the things here are spared

180
00:10:24,609 --> 00:10:27,609
from the evil hands of the Magician under the Moonlight.

181
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:31,109
I shall leave the security within the museum to you, then,

182
00:10:31,109 --> 00:10:33,109
Advisor Suzuki.

183
00:10:33,109 --> 00:10:34,209
Yeah.

184
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:38,617
They're sure suspicious characters.

185
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:41,409
Say... Maybe he's got all the things exhibited here

186
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:44,309
covered by a high amount of insurance?

187
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:47,009
I thought so too, and checked,

188
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:51,009
but only a measly amount was insured.

189
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:52,631
The admission fee is cheap too,

190
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:56,409
so if anything is stolen, it would be a great loss.

191
00:10:56,409 --> 00:10:59,209
Then, uncle, just what do you intend to do?

192
00:11:00,109 --> 00:11:03,809
Well, you've got some kind of strategy worked out, don't you?

193
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:06,209
Well, the thing is...

194
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,709
No?

195
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:11,909
You prepared virtually nothing?

196
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:14,409
-No. -"No," huh?

197
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:16,409
If he were going to come here to steal something,

198
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,309
I have to prevent him from doing so.

199
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:20,659
But there is nothing I can do

200
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:22,661
if he wants to come to return something.

201
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:27,209
All three items are small enough to hide into his pocket.

202
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:31,309
Besides, I had my hands full just trying to make the space for them.

203
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:32,671
"Spaced Reserved for Thief Kid's Returned Treasures"

204
00:11:33,909 --> 00:11:35,009
You mean the assumed location

205
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:37,609
for where Thief Kid will be returning the treasure.

206
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:40,679
If only I knew when and what time he's planning to show up,

207
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,109
there is something I could do, but...

208
00:11:43,109 --> 00:11:44,683
Huh? You mean there was nothing about

209
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:46,685
when he would be coming in the letter?

210
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:48,687
Right, there was nothing!

211
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:52,691
There hasn't been one time till now when Kid implied

212
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:55,709
or made no mention of the time and date he would be showing up.

213
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:57,909
Inspector Nakamori...

214
00:11:57,909 --> 00:12:00,699
Don't tell me it's someone else then, trying to copy Kid,

215
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:02,309
and putting the blame on him?

216
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:06,705
No, that letter is definitely what he had sent.

217
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:09,809
Maybe he's planning to mail another letter when he has the chance,

218
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:12,209
indicating the time and date he'll be showing up?

219
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:14,713
Like, his schedule is too busy now

220
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:17,209
so he's waiting for a convenient date or something.

221
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:19,409
If so,

222
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:22,409
what could he be waiting for?

223
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:46,109
It sure is popular, just as expected.

224
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:47,509
Yes.

225
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:50,509
But the most popular is...

226
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:53,309
the place that Kid is assumed to return the treasure.

227
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:55,509
I'm sure that Ryoma is vexed to tears.

228
00:12:59,109 --> 00:13:01,309
Hey, stop pushing!

229
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:15,509
Hold it!

230
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:17,309
I see.

231
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:20,009
A sensor is set up to that space only

232
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:24,209
and plain clothes officers are mingled among the crowd.

233
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:26,009
I'm sorry.

234
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:28,409
I was just playing.

235
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:30,789
And if a suspicious person should appear,

236
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:33,509
it's rigged so that the person can be nabbed on the spot.

237
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:34,809
Advisor!

238
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:40,109
What's with all the noise?

239
00:13:40,109 --> 00:13:43,209
Just now, this was found in the mailbox of your residence!

240
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:48,409
This is...

241
00:13:48,409 --> 00:13:50,109
A letter from Kid?

242
00:13:50,109 --> 00:13:51,209
What?

243
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:56,815
Tomorrow at 20:00 just before closing time.

244
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:59,509
I will bring the pistol in question

245
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:02,821
and would like to cleanse my comrades of the government

246
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,509
in the name of Ryoma Sakamoto.

247
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:08,209
Thief Kid.

248
00:14:10,109 --> 00:14:16,509
Kid!

249
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:18,837
Just what does this mean?

250
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:20,309
Cleanse.

251
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:22,509
Water...

252
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:23,709
Don't tell me!

253
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:31,109
Rain.

254
00:14:31,109 --> 00:14:33,509
Was this what Kid was waiting for?

255
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:51,609
I pledge to clean up once and for all.

256
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:52,871
Right now!

257
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,570
Take a look at this super long line!

258
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,170
Hearing that Thief Kid informed that

259
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,070
he will be committing the crime at 20:00 tomorrow,

260
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,970
despite it being right before closing time,

261
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,370
Thief Kid's fans are gathering one after the other over

262
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,893
to the Great Suzuki Museum forming a crowd!

263
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,670
Will Thief Kid appear as predicted

264
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:21,270
and be able to return the items that were stolen 20 years ago,

265
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,901
that is, Ryoma Sakamoto's letter, the goblet

266
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:24,903
and the pistol?

267
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:26,905
Or, is he planning to steal the gunbelt

268
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:29,570
in return for the things he will be returning?

269
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,870
And, what is his true intention behind suddenly publically

270
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,270
announcing the day he will be committing the crime?

271
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:37,270
Will everything be made clear tomorrow?

272
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:41,770
What? Rain?

273
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,570
You mean Kid waited for it to rain

274
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,070
before he decided on the day of his crime to be carried out?

275
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,570
Yes! It looks like it's going to start raining anytime outside now,

276
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,270
and tomorrow's weather forecast says it'll rain!

277
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:55,970
But, how on earth does he intend to use the rain to his advantage?

278
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,770
Is he planning to bust through the ceiling

279
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,939
where the Ryoma Exhibition is being held?

280
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:05,470
No, my staff checked the museum right before opening,

281
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,947
but there are no explosives set up at all!

282
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:12,570
Maybe it's the clothes the people are wearing?

283
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,953
Because when it rains,

284
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:16,955
there are a lot of people wearing raincoats.

285
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,470
I see!

286
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:22,270
If he's mingled among that crowd, he would be inconspicuous!

287
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,370
Right, right!

288
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,470
It's hard to believe that Kid would've been waiting for rain

289
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,967
because of such a dinky reason but...

290
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,970
At any rate, I think we should cancel the exhibition tomorrow

291
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,973
and keep people from coming here!

292
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:37,370
Then, he would end up coming to this exhibition hall

293
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,870
where only we are on guard,

294
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:44,570
all alone in order to return three items in question.

295
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:50,370
It'll turn into an ideal situation to nab him!

296
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,470
But, up to now he has always under similar situations,

297
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,470
disguised himself as you or one of your men,

298
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:59,570
and while putting everyone to sleep using sleeping gas.

299
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,001
Not this time! We will all be wearing gas masks

300
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:05,570
as well as verify everything using passwords.

301
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,770
If we make sure to strictly follow set procedures, all will be fine!

302
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,870
So long as there aren't any people getting in our way,

303
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,270
we can definitely nab him.

304
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,370
I can't really agree to your plan, though.

305
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,270
I gathered items having to do with Ryoma Sakamoto

306
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,270
and am holding this exhibition

307
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,170
because I want to introduce them to as many people as possible.

308
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,470
And yet to say, the exhibition should be held off

309
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,027
for an entire day just for one thief,

310
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:31,770
I really can't agree that's a very good idea.

311
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:34,470
Oh, but, you see...

312
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,270
Moreover, during the instant teleportation incident,

313
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,970
just because the people were kept from coming inside,

314
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,070
it seems that Kid called off the crime to be committed.

315
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:47,370
He's coming all this way to return the three items

316
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,470
that were stolen from me 20 years ago, you know?

317
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,770
I really don't want him to call it off.

318
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:59,057
At any rate, please let the people in as usual tomorrow!

319
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:01,370
Whether you can catch Kid or not

320
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,570
depends on your skill and capability!

321
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:08,270
Besides, I wish you'd guard and protect what you should be protecting.

322
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,470
After Kid returns the three items,

323
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,770
I've heard rumors that he will be coming after

324
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:16,170
the featured item of the Ryoma Exhibition,

325
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:21,079
the gunbelt that Ryoma owned, as his reward.

326
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:23,081
Well, I trust you will do your job.

327
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,670
Police officers!

328
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,870
Darn!

329
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,870
If they trust us, why don't they cooperate?

330
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,091
But, we've got a problem.

331
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:34,470
With so many people here,

332
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,770
he'd be able to return the three items fairly easily.

333
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:41,099
There's one way that he wouldn't be able to do that!

334
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,570
Remember? It was also written in his letter that just got here!

335
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,570
Tomorrow at 20:00 just before closing time.

336
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,170
I will bring the pistol in question

337
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,570
and would like to cleanse my comrades of the government

338
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:59,117
in the name of Ryoma Sakamoto once again.

339
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,670
What about this?

340
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:04,270
Well, Kid's going to come not to steal something like usual

341
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,970
but rather to return things, you know?

342
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,370
Moreover, one of the items is a pistol.

343
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,270
If you use a metal detector gate like the one

344
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:14,770
they use at airports and check, it'll be easy to find him!

345
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,135
Because the one holding the pistol is Kid!

346
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,570
True.

347
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,770
You're so smart, Conan.

348
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:29,147
We the police thought about that too,

349
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:31,770
but were told from the higher ups not to!

350
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,870
Why?

351
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,370
If we were to protect something,

352
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,155
we would set things up at the entrance,

353
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:40,470
but if he sees something set up before coming into the museum,

354
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,161
we figured he'd think twice about returning the items!

355
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:45,163
Then, why not set it up not at the entrance,

356
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:49,870
just before this room with the Ryoma Exhibition?

357
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,870
And a lot too, so the people won't stop in place!

358
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,270
Oh, come on.

359
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,770
That's a great idea!

360
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,570
While we're at it, we could set up an X-Ray device

361
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,370
that can scan the insides of hand carry bags, then, it'll be perfect!!

362
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,770
Hey, Kid's coming tomorrow, you know?

363
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,970
We could never get those things ready by then.

364
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:12,470
Oh, with the power of the Suzuki Financial Group,

365
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,870
that poses no problem!

366
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:17,195
We could nab him at the gate!

367
00:20:17,195 --> 00:20:21,570
If anyone is to see the gate and back off in fear,

368
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,070
that would be the Kid!

369
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,570
Okay! Start setting up the gates right away!

370
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:31,209
Turn the museum into a large cage trap in half a day

371
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:33,211
to catch the Kid!

372
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:34,470
Yes, sir!

373
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:40,170
Just as expected, rich people sure are flashy.

374
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,770
Okay, you guys!

375
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,221
There is a high possibility that

376
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:46,170
Kid has come in here beforehand with a pistol!

377
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,570
Check every nook and cranny of the museum

378
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,229
-using the metal detector! -Yes, sir!

379
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:02,070
"The Next Day"

380
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,670
Officers on guard at the entrance of the museum!

381
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,870
How is it going there?

382
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,870
Sir!

383
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,970
There's no one who noticed the gate and rushed to leave!

384
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,770
Is the metal detection gate functioning all right?

385
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:18,570
Yes! There is no one in possession of the pistol in question.

386
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,270
What about inside the exhibition room?

387
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:24,770
No one who looks to be Kid has appeared yet.

388
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,570
Is Kid really going to come?

389
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,070
Idiot!

390
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,070
There isn't a time that Kid had warned of a crime

391
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,269
and not shown up!

392
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,070
I'm sorry!

393
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,070
Come on, Kid.

394
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:40,770
I'll catch you for sure this time!

395
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,270
Wow, fantastic!

396
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,770
It really looks like the boarding gate of an airport!

397
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:50,170
Moreover, there are three gates in all.

398
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:53,291
Just as expected of Uncle. He's really something!

399
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,170
Something bothers me after all.

400
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,870
Writing something like,

401
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,770
"I'll be bringing the pistol with me" deliberately,

402
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:08,770
I'm sure he would assume something like this would happen, and yet...

403
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,670
In addition, I can't even make out

404
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:14,470
how he plans to use the rain to his advantage yet, either.

405
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,470
The last sentence of the letter.

406
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,670
"I pledge to clean up once and for all."

407
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,870
I don't understand what it means.

408
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:25,323
Did he just happen to use Ryoma's phrase to play on words?

409
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:30,570
Or is he really planning to wash something?

410
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:31,770
Darn!

411
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,770
What on earth is Thief Kid going to be washing?

412
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,892
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:03,892 --> 00:24:05,960
"Water Color Paint"

414
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,874
I'm returning stolen treasure this time

415
00:24:07,874 --> 00:24:09,132
so stay out of my way.

416
00:24:09,132 --> 00:24:11,040
I wonder about that.
