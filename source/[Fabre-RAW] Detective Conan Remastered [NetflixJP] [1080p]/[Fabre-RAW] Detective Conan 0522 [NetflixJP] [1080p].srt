1
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,230
A year ago,

2
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,430
I, Shinichi Kudo solved a murder case at East Okuho Village.

3
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,430
A letter saying that a deduction miss that I made

4
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,830
was found was delivered to me via Heiji Hattori.

5
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,530
"Makoto Okuda (19)" -We went over to East Okuho Village

6
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,730
to meet with the sender Mr. Makoto Okuda, but...

7
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,430
Makoto's whereabouts was presently unknown.

8
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,430
And, for some reason,

9
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,030
the villagers seemed to have feelings of enmity against Shinichi Kudo.

10
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,530
I went alone to the mountain cabin

11
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,030
where Makoto had arranged to meet me.

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,730
Excuse me.

13
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,330
This thing I'm feeling...

14
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,630
It can't be...

15
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,630
I made it thinking to secretly try it on him

16
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,430
when he comes to spend the night here next time.

17
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,630
That medicine is the miracle drug

18
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,930
that could maybe change his body

19
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,630
that had become that of a child due to APTX 4869

20
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,630
to the body of the high school student that it used to be.

21
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,830
Shinichi?

22
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,030
Shinichi!

23
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,630
Shinichi...

24
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,930
Is that my name?

25
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,230
Don't tell me that Shinichi...

26
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,630
Lost his memory?

27
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,830
That drug is only a prototype.

28
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,830
There may be a slight discrepancy

29
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,430
but the longest the effect will continue is more or less 24 hours.

30
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,930
Twenty four hours?

31
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,730
You've got to make sure he regains his memory by then

32
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,930
or else we're in big trouble.

33
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,530
Let's take Shinichi to that murder site too then.

34
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,430
He just may remember something.

35
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,230
Shinichi Kudo there deduced this case to be

36
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:54,130
a forced double suicide that Mr. Hinohara committed.

37
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,630
What the heck is Kudo's deduction blooper?

38
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,130
The motive for the Mr. Hinohara committing forced double suicide

39
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,230
was because his doctor declared that he had cancer

40
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,630
and he was full of despair.

41
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,030
"Misato Kawauchi (36)" -The problem arose when Mr. Kudo

42
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,030
publicized the truth a year ago.

43
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,730
She told him that although he did have cancer, the tumor was benign,

44
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,130
and it would be completely cured with surgery.

45
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,230
Hearing this, the former he seemed very happy.

46
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,830
What?

47
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,830
Hey, Kudo. What the heck is going on?

48
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,830
Mr. Kudo, I know what you're up to.

49
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,630
The truth that you're trying to hide

50
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,130
the fact that you cannot speak of.

51
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,630
Did I do it?

52
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,130
Did I... kill her?

53
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,830
Hold up for a while,

54
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,030
until I find the real culprit and let you out of here.

55
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,530
I've got to solve the case completely before sundown at all cost.

56
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,330
Impossible crime.

57
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,730
A mysterious murder trick, but...

58
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,630
Shinichi would...

59
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,430
I'm sure that Shinichi would find a way.

60
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,730
Death...

61
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,730
Please.

62
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,130
Return Shinichi back to normal.

63
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,730
Death.

64
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,630
A crisis is gracefully revived.

65
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,730
The table is turned and the mystery solved.

66
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,530
The unbelievable truth that Heiji discloses.

67
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,430
Ran's tears doesn't stop as she watches Shinichi.

68
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,030
He sees through the one and only truth.

69
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,930
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

70
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,930
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

71
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,730
Sorry, Ran.

72
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,230
Go on home ahead.

73
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,830
Oh, hey.

74
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,330
I'll catch up with you right away!

75
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,730
Shinichi!

76
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,130
He's going away.

77
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,430
Shinichi's...

78
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,130
Shinichi's going away.

79
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,530
No. Don't go.

80
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,830
Shinichi!

81
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:14,630
"Shinichi's True Colors and Ran's Tears"

82
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,230
Where am I?

83
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,530
I remember.

84
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,830
I found Death in the forest and I went after him

85
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,530
then I slipped.

86
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,730
My wounds are treated.

87
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,830
Who on earth?

88
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,830
Ran!

89
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,130
I found Ran!

90
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,830
-What? -Kazuha.

91
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,030
Are you all right?

92
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,730
What's with the bandages?

93
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:59,330
I fell in the forest and passed out.

94
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,330
It seems that someone brought me here and treated my wounds.

95
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,130
I'm sure it was the owner of this hut

96
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,430
so we've got to thank him when he gets back.

97
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,230
No, the owner of this hut doesn't seem to be a nice person.

98
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,730
What?

99
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,530
The transceiver?

100
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,530
Heiji, where are you?

101
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,130
In the next room.

102
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,130
Come over here, will you? The place is a mess.

103
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,430
Come over you say,

104
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,630
but the door is closed off with a wooden board.

105
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,030
Go outside once and come in through the window.

106
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,730
Yes, I guess so.

107
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,030
Hey, what's this?

108
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,130
This place is full of the pictures

109
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,030
and articles of the detective kid.

110
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,830
Yes. It seems that whoever it is, is really infatuated with Kudo.

111
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,530
To the point of wanting to kill him.

112
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,130
His picture is slashed up.

113
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:57,530
Ran, didn't you really see the person who carried you here?

114
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,330
No, all I saw was Death in the forest.

115
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,930
Death?

116
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:03,930
Are you serious?

117
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:09,330
It seems that the owner of this hut is that what you may call "Death".

118
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,530
Look at this.

119
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,930
It's gray hair made of polyester used to make wigs.

120
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,730
The hair of Death that you saw was also white, wasn't it?

121
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:23,230
Yes, but he didn't look like such a bad person,

122
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,530
although I was scared.

123
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,730
I guess so.

124
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,330
After all he seems to have treated Ran's wounds for her too.

125
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,630
Maybe he's up to no good after feigning to be kind

126
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,430
and getting everyone off guard.

127
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,430
Well, but it's true that he's a dangerous character for sure.

128
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,830
There's an empty box for bullets.

129
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,330
Shattered pieces of glass of cracked mirrors.

130
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,330
There are at least 5 to 6 cracked mirrors.

131
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,530
And to top everything off...

132
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,930
The nasty words that are carved on this desk say.

133
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,430
"Failure means death".

134
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,430
Hey, if there's an empty box for bullets, it means...

135
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:06,430
Yes. It means that Death may be carrying around a dangerous weapon.

136
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,430
Does that mean that the one who stabbed

137
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,930
the newspaper reporter lady

138
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,730
and made it look like Shinichi did it, is Death's doing?

139
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,230
Yes, most likely.

140
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,630
Since he seems to hate Kudo too.

141
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,630
But if so, he would've had to call the lady and Kudo

142
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,530
over to that house and wait for them.

143
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,130
But the shoe prints of the culprit

144
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,430
weren't found anywhere around the house.

145
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,330
It rained all night and the ground was damp,

146
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,030
and yet nothing was found.

147
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:39,030
Maybe he was already in the house before it started raining?

148
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,130
Idiot!

149
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,930
If so, the culprit could've never made it out of the house

150
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,830
without leaving any footprints behind.

151
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,630
I checked around the house last night

152
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,530
because of the case that happened a year ago

153
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,430
and found that in order to go in and out of the house,

154
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,230
you have to walk on the ground somewhere around the house

155
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,830
no matter how you do it.

156
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,730
Besides, before the police and ambulance came this morning,

157
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,230
we searched through the house,

158
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,230
but found nobody there, right?

159
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,130
True.

160
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:11,330
Right. Who called the police and ambulance?

161
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,630
Did you hear anything on it?

162
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,930
Yes.

163
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,630
Both calls seem to have been made

164
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,530
by the same young man who sounded like he had a bad cold.

165
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,630
What?

166
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,730
Couldn't that have been Shinichi?

167
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,630
In fact, the person who called the newspaper reporter,

168
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,630
Mrs. Kawauchi at the inn she was staying at,

169
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,830
was also said to have been a young man who sounded like he had a bad cold.

170
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:34,130
The man who called them said that his name was Shinichi Kudo.

171
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,530
You mean Kudo called that lady

172
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,430
and called the ambulance and police as well?

173
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:44,930
Could it be that he's pretending to have amnesia,

174
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,130
but actually thinking of something?

175
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,330
Mrs. Kawauchi said something similar to what you just said too.

176
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,330
What?

177
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:54,230
That remark that Mrs. Kawauchi made last night still bothers me.

178
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,930
Oh, my. What's with that look of yours?

179
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,530
Don't tell me that you thought I didn't realize either?

180
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,830
After that, I went to Mrs. Kawauchi's inn to ask her about it,

181
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,130
and she answered me.

182
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,230
She said that Mr. Kudo is just faking he has amnesia.

183
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,230
And that he has something up his sleeve.

184
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,730
I see.

185
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,130
The lady said what she did last night

186
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,830
hoping to get more information on Kudo.

187
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,430
At any rate, there's no mistake

188
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,630
that this is the house of a dangerous character.

189
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,230
We've got to call the police over here right away.

190
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,930
Yes, sir.

191
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,830
I know we can somehow get out of the forest,

192
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,730
but I'm not sure if we'll be able to make it back here again.

193
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,630
Then, we'll make a bonfire again

194
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,430
and use the smoke to guide us.

195
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,930
Bonfire?

196
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,130
Yes.

197
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,630
You saw the bonfire near the stone

198
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,930
that looked like a tombstone, didn't you?

199
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,630
That's what was burning.

200
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,930
He was just probably getting dinner ready,

201
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,630
when we showed up. So, he probably got up and fled.

202
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:56,630
Could it be that the culprit fled from the little window

203
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,730
by the ceiling of the next room?

204
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,230
You mean that window.

205
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,830
But, isn't it a bit too small for an adult to make it out of there?

206
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,830
The shoe prints of a child's shoes.

207
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,430
It's Kudo.

208
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:16,630
I'm sure he was summoned here by that letter

209
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,530
"Mr. Shinichi Kudo" -and confined here.

210
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,930
So, he escaped from that window.

211
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,730
But who on earth confined him?

212
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:29,830
The whereabouts of Makoto Okuda's been unknown for the past six months.

213
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,930
I'm sure Makoto's been killed.

214
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:37,930
Is Makoto Okuda dead or alive?

215
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,230
Hold it, hold it.

216
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,530
Let me think it over from the start once more.

217
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,730
The slashed up pictures of Kudo.

218
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,130
It seems that the culprit really hates him.

219
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,030
And the words on the desk.

220
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,330
The culprit is trying to do something

221
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,530
even if it means taking his own life.

222
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,830
Is he planning to take revenge on Kudo?

223
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:00,830
There was an empty box for bullets in the next room.

224
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:04,230
The culprit most likely is armed with a gun.

225
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,430
I'm sure he had many chances to shoot Kudo if he wanted to.

226
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,130
Why didn't he do anything?

227
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,730
The lady called Kawauchi was stabbed with a knife.

228
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,930
How on earth is he planning to use the gun?

229
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,430
And, another thing that's bothering me is...

230
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,330
the mirror that was shattered to pieces.

231
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:26,330
Why did he have to crack so many mirrors like that?

232
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,930
Don't tell me that...

233
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,130
Don't tell me that he...

234
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,330
While you go out and call the police,

235
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,330
I'd like you to check on something for me.

236
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,730
But, how on earth am I going to check on something like that?

237
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,330
Don't worry.

238
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,930
This will do it, I guarantee.

239
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,230
Will this be enough?

240
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,430
I guess so.

241
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,530
That'll be enough for us to see the smoke from far away too.

242
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,330
And we won't have to go around in circles getting lost in the forest.

243
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,030
I wonder what sport consists of going around in circles,

244
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,930
you know, that Mr. Hinohara used to do?

245
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:19,230
I think it's some kind of field and track sports.

246
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,030
Remember, I told you that we asked the person

247
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,730
at the inn about Death, right?

248
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:29,830
We asked that person what sport Mr. Hinohara was into,

249
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,230
and was told that although he wasn't sure of what it was called

250
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,530
but said it was something that spun round and round.

251
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,930
Spin round and round?

252
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:38,530
Field sports that would include spinning something

253
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,930
would either be hammer throwing or discus.

254
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,930
Oh, right, he also mentioned that Mr. Hinohara was good at quoits.

255
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,130
Quoits?

256
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:50,430
It seems that his son, Daiki was bragging about it to everyone.

257
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,930
He goes around saying that his father was really good at quoits

258
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,930
an always got a perfect score.

259
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:58,530
Perfect score?

260
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,430
-It's that police officer. -Darn!

261
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,030
Hey!

262
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,230
What's up? What's wrong?

263
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:21,730
Death...

264
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:26,030
Death suddenly appeared before my eyes then...

265
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,530
I suddenly passed out.

266
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:39,830
Hey, the mouth of the holster of the gun is open!

267
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,430
Don't worry.

268
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,030
Your gun hasn't been taken.

269
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,030
But, why only the gun?

270
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,330
You mean he bought the bullets but didn't own a gun?

271
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:55,830
I wonder... I can't say for now yet.

272
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,630
But, I more or less have an idea of the case.

273
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,330
Later for the hut.

274
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,530
Let's get everybody together at Mr. Hinohara's house

275
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,430
and solve the mystery, shall we?

276
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,730
A High School Detective from Osaka?

277
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,830
Heiji Hattori?

278
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:20,030
Are you saying that you're going to solve the mystery

279
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:25,230
of how Mrs. Kawauchi was stabbed here this morning?

280
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,730
Yes, exactly.

281
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,130
Before that...

282
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:35,030
If possible, I'd like you to bring along the owner

283
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,530
of the of the mysterious footprints that left

284
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,830
from the backdoor over here with you.

285
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,130
Of course, I brought him along

286
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,430
the owner of the footprints.

287
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:49,430
Shinichi Kudo, it's you.

288
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,930
What's with the blood on your clothes?

289
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,030
Hey, hey...

290
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,530
Don't tell me that Shinichi's the culprit?

291
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,830
Of all the footprints left in front of this house,

292
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,130
if you exclude the footprints of us

293
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:05,030
who have an alibi because we were back at the inn

294
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,730
and those of Mrs. Kawauchi,

295
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,730
the only footprints left would be his.

296
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,530
Blood of the victim is splattered on his clothes,

297
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,130
his fingerprints are on the murder weapon...

298
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,230
No matter how you look at it, he's the murderer.

299
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,230
That's true.

300
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,230
Because he is the killer.

301
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,730
In other words,

302
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,330
no trick was used in committing the crime.

303
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,330
What?

304
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,330
Heiji.

305
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,230
What are you up to?

306
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,830
Is this some kind of strategy?

307
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,430
It's not a strategy.

308
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,530
I'm saying that this guy called Mrs. Kawauchi out by phone

309
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,530
and stabbed her.

310
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,430
Hold it.

311
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:02,630
You insisted this morning that he'd never stab anybody.

312
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,630
I... I was scared.

313
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,530
That newspaper reporter said that

314
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:12,730
she'd expose the blunder that I made a year ago.

315
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:16,430
She threatened me saying that she'd shatter the fame

316
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,030
and pride that I'd established up to now.

317
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,430
I didn't know what it was about, but...

318
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,130
I was so scared that I inadvertently...

319
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,830
Who is he?

320
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:45,030
No. He's not Shinichi.

321
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,830
The Shinichi that I've be waiting for is...

322
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,930
The person that's been filling my heart.

323
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,230
The Shinichi that I've been longing for is...

324
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:09,430
It's just as you say, Kazuha.

325
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,730
I can't...

326
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,830
I can't stop my tears from falling.

327
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:30,190
Did you really call the newspaper reporter, Mrs. Kawauchi here and stab her?

328
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,690
Yes. I did it.

329
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,290
I just can't believe it.

330
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,590
Your deduction a year ago was fantastic.

331
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,390
You saw through the trick in the wink of an eye

332
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:47,790
and paved the way to solving the case with lightning speed.

333
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,590
Why would a person like you, do something like this?

334
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,390
You're over evaluating me.

335
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,190
I'm not God.

336
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,590
I hate people and make mistakes too.

337
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:04,290
It seems that a year ago

338
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,590
I wrongly made a culprit out of Mr. Hinohara

339
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,990
who was innocent.

340
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:14,990
Maybe you don't remember because you've lost your memory.

341
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,190
But as far as that incident is concerned, there was legitimate evidence.

342
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,390
Excuse me.

343
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,890
The test results have been reached

344
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,790
so I thought I'd report it.

345
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,890
Test results?

346
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,990
That boy from Osaka asked me to get it.

347
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,790
He asked me to check if the murder weapon knife

348
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:35,290
and the piece of chain inside the lucky charm pouch that the boy had

349
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,590
matched or not.

350
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,790
And, what about the result?

351
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,590
Just as you said, they didn't match.

352
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:48,590
All right! It's just as I deduced!

353
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:51,390
You mean that lucky charm, right?

354
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,390
What does it have to with the knife?

355
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,090
What on earth didn't match?

356
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:01,690
It's what all humans are bestowed with

357
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,590
from the heavens when they are born,

358
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,590
an emblem that stays with you till the end of your lifetime.

359
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,590
Since there is no one with the same,

360
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,590
when it comes to criminal investigation,

361
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:18,390
it is considered to be one of the most reliable evidence.

362
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,190
Fingerprints, isn't it?

363
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,190
Yes.

364
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,590
Who is he?

365
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,890
Death?

366
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,990
Stand back.

367
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,490
A gun?

368
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,490
No use.

369
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,690
Cut it out.

370
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:54,890
Enough with the costume party already.

371
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,790
Costume party?

372
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,590
What're you talking about?

373
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,690
Yes. If any trick was involved in this case

374
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,990
it's his face.

375
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,990
I mean it's unthinkable that the high school detective Shinichi Kudo

376
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,790
would ever stab anybody.

377
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,990
The first thing that bothered me was

378
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:18,790
the attitude that Mouri's daughter took.

379
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,590
Despite the Kudo she'd been waiting for all this time

380
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,790
appearing before her,

381
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,290
she acted as if she didn't know him and displayed a cold attitude.

382
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,790
Normally, she would've clung to him and not let go, right?

383
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:34,890
And the more so, if he has amnesia,

384
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:38,890
at first I thought she was just hiding her embarrassment,

385
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,690
but after I checked the hut of the culprit in the forest, I found out why!

386
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,290
Culprit's hut?

387
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:46,290
Yes, the pictures of Kudo that are pinned up on the wall

388
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,390
were all slashed to pieces,

389
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,590
and a great number of mirrors were cracked

390
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,290
with the shattered pieces scattered over the floor.

391
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:56,890
There could be only one reason that the guy who hates Kudo to the point

392
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:00,890
of slashing his pictures would crack mirrors to pieces.

393
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:05,690
He couldn't stand seeing the face of Kudo

394
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,190
that was reflected in the mirror.

395
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,890
Don't tell me that...

396
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:16,190
Yes, he underwent plastic surgery

397
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,590
and changed his face to that of this green-horn detective...

398
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,390
stupid high school detective.

399
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,020
Hey, this is...

400
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,820
He's a perfect double.

401
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,620
But, why would you change your face to Shinichi's?

402
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,720
He called me out to that hut,

403
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,920
confined me there and after becoming me,

404
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,120
he was probably scheming to commit some sort of crime.

405
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,120
His intention was to probably annihilate I, Shinichi Kudo...

406
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,620
as a person, and from society too.

407
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,820
Annihilate you?

408
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,320
He pretended to have amnesia

409
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,620
so that he wouldn't have to answer anything

410
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,420
that my friends who he supposed would come along with me may ask.

411
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,420
He went into the lake naked and had a hoarse voice

412
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,520
as if having a cold for the same reason.

413
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,120
Although he could make himself look like me,

414
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,820
he couldn't copy my voice.

415
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,820
Neither did he know what kind of clothes I would be wearing.

416
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:37,720
Well, I too, when escaping from that hut fell into the lake,

417
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,220
and have a bit of a hoarse voice with a cold.

418
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,320
Then, the one who called the ambulance and police this morning

419
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,520
-right after the incident was... -Me.

420
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,620
I saw Mrs. Kawauchi and he come into this house,

421
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,820
so I prepared for the worse.

422
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,120
Then, why didn't you yourself rush inside and stop him?

423
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,720
I couldn't even if I wanted to.

424
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,620
Because when he came out of the house last night,

425
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,320
from the protrusion in the back of his clothes,

426
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,520
I was sure that he was armed with a gun.

427
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,420
I guess it can't be helped.

428
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,920
After all, "Failure means death"

429
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,520
was carved on the desk too.

430
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,520
Yes.

431
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,420
If he was ready to shoot a specific person,

432
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,620
maybe I could've stopped him.

433
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,320
If he had his mind made up to kill himself

434
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,120
as soon as he found out that his scheme didn't work,

435
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,720
the time I had to stop him was limited.

436
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,920
That's why I took the bullets out of Officer Shiroyama's gun

437
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,120
and scattered it before his eyes

438
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,320
to make him hesitate and putting him off guard.

439
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,320
Because he was probably planning to carry out his scheme

440
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,720
as soon as I appeared before him.

441
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,620
Isn't that right, Okuda?

442
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,220
Rather, Makoto Hinohara?

443
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,020
Makoto? You mean you're Makoto?

444
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,220
He sure is.

445
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,520
To do this much with plastic surgery

446
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,520
would cost a lot of time and money.

447
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:09,120
But, Makoto could do it because he got a lot of estate

448
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,920
and his whereabouts were unknown for six months.

449
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,320
If so, he would've hidden the gun in his own room in this house.

450
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,120
He assumed beforehand that they would bring him back here

451
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,120
to help him regain his memory.

452
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,420
He then tells everyone that he wants to be alone,

453
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,320
and that's when he retrieves the gun.

454
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:34,020
But, why, why did he have to stab the newspaper reporter?

455
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,120
He probably thought that she found out about everything

456
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,520
because of her remark last night.

457
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,220
Oh, my. What's with that look of yours?

458
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,220
Don't tell me that you thought I didn't realize either?

459
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,120
That you underwent plastic surgery to make yourself look like Kudo.

460
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,020
But, I don't understand.

461
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,920
When I came over to the house this morning,

462
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:58,620
why didn't you say that you stabbed Mrs. Kawauchi?

463
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,320
If you wanted to frame Kudo for the murder,

464
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,720
wouldn't that have been faster?

465
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,520
I was testing you detectives out.

466
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,020
I wanted to see what kind of deduction

467
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:17,820
you'd come up with after the evidence all pointed

468
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,120
to Shinichi Kudo being the murderer.

469
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,120
Well, it seems they saw you through completely.

470
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,520
Then, what about the incident that occurred a year ago?

471
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,520
What's with Shinichi Kudo who made a stupid deduction

472
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,920
saying that Mr. Hinohara committed forced double suicide

473
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,020
when a robber made away with the valuables and murdered them?

474
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,220
What about him?

475
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,320
Kudo didn't make a mistake.

476
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,320
That was a forced double suicide.

477
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,420
What?

478
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,520
The murder weapon of the killer,

479
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,720
Mrs. Hinohara's jewelry,

480
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,420
as well as her valuable Nioh statue were taken, you know?

481
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,520
It's more than obvious that the killer took it with him.

482
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,820
The lake...

483
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,920
After Mr. Hinohara stabbed his wife,

484
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,720
he sunk the murder weapon together with the jewelry into the lake.

485
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,620
What're you talking about?

486
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:19,620
It's close to 30 meters from this house to the lake.

487
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,020
How would the culprit be able to take all that

488
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,320
to the lake without leaving footprints behind?

489
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,620
Not only the murder weapon and the jewelry,

490
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,820
but the strings for the gold medals

491
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,920
and the loops for quoits are also gone.

492
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,920
Quoits?

493
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:35,120
Mr. Hinohara's son Daiki was saying, remember?

494
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,020
That his father was good at quoits

495
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,820
and always played a perfect game, right?

496
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,220
The scores that are written on the target of quoits

497
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,820
are 10 points, 5 points, 2 points.

498
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,720
So, if he wants to play a perfect game scoring 100 points,

499
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,920
he needs 10 quoits, but there were only 9.

500
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:55,420
Besides, one pair of the Nioh statue was left untouched

501
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,220
and taking into consideration

502
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:01,220
that Mr. Hinohara used to be a player of field sports,

503
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,820
the answer is obvious.

504
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,220
Hammer throwing.

505
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,620
He packed the Nioh statue that he used for weight together

506
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,620
with the murder weapon, shoes and jewelry into a bag,

507
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,220
and used the quoit as a handle

508
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,120
by tying on the string of medal onto the package.

509
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,220
He did this all to throw the bag into the lake from the veranda

510
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,320
as he would do when hammer throwing.

511
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,720
I see.

512
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,220
He left one Nion statue behind

513
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:31,320
because putting both in the bag would make it too heavy

514
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,920
and the bag wouldn't reach the lake.

515
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,520
Ridiculous.

516
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,420
The bag would've never made it because of resistance from the wind.

517
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,320
No, the bag made it.

518
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,620
The bag, string and quoits

519
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,520
have already been retrieved from the lake.

520
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:50,020
Of course on the blade of the murder weapon knife,

521
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,320
Mrs. Hinohara's blood was found and on the handle of the knife,

522
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,620
Mr. Hinohara's fingerprints were found.

523
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,620
There's no mistake that it was a forced double suicide

524
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,020
committed by Mr. Hinohara.

525
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,420
Not true.

526
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:06,320
He probably made it look like the doings of an armed robber

527
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,020
so that his son, Daiki wouldn't realize what happened.

528
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:15,120
That's a lie! Mr. Hinohara who was cheerful and kind man

529
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,020
would never commit forced double suicide with his wife.

530
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,820
Besides the Mr. Hinohara's cancer was found to be benign

531
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,120
and it turned out that the motive for his murderous act

532
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,620
which was because he was depressed over it was also a lie.

533
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,520
After the doctor told him about his cancer.

534
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,020
Another problem came into the light.

535
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,920
After the physical exam,

536
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,620
it turned out that Mr. Hinohara's blood type was...

537
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,620
in fact, AB.

538
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,620
Hey, wait!

539
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,420
I thought I heard that Mr. Hinohara's family

540
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,420
was a cheerful blood type O family.

541
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,420
Yes.

542
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,720
According to Mendel's Law of Heredity,

543
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,820
a child with blood type O is not born

544
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,720
from parents whose blood type is AB and O.

545
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,120
In other words,

546
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,120
Daiki is not Mr. Hinohara's son.

547
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,620
Oh no.

548
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,420
My god.

549
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,720
Don't lie.

550
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,620
I see.

551
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,520
If that was his motive for committing the murder,

552
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,420
it's something that people would want to keep secret.

553
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,220
Yes. That's why it was announced

554
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,020
that the motive for him committing the murder

555
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,920
was because he was told he had cancer.

556
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:32,020
But if so, why didn't he tell me about it?

557
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,320
I was a part of the family and yet!

558
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,020
I already told you why.

559
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,420
Because Mr. Kudo told me to.

560
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,220
Don't dare tell anybody.

561
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,820
But, please do tell Makoto about this.

562
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,120
When? Where did you tell me this?

563
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,020
Here, the night after Mr. Kudo finished investigating the case and left.

564
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,920
But, come to think of it.

565
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,420
The truth about Mr. Hinohara having committed forced double suicide

566
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,020
that I told you about first was so shocking

567
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,620
that you may not have been listening to what I was saying.

568
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,520
No.

569
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,120
It's not possible.

570
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,120
What the heck is wrong with me?

571
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,120
What the heck did I go and change my face for?

572
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,820
What the heck?

573
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:40,920
A tragedy brought about by a much too unfortunate coincidence.

574
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,320
Seeing my face breaking out in tears before me,

575
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,620
I thought that...

576
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,720
I can't ever forget this face.

577
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,520
That I should engraved it deep inside of me.

578
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,820
So that guy called Makoto was Death.

579
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,220
Yes. He was the 2nd one though.

580
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,420
The second one?

581
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:14,320
The first was his father.

582
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,620
In order to prevent the children of the village

583
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,420
from going through the same misfortune as his daughter

584
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,220
who had died in the forest.

585
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,020
He built a hut in the forest

586
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,120
and lived in it as Death,

587
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,920
to scare and keep people from entering the forest.

588
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,420
He did so until he fell ill and died 3 years ago.

589
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:36,020
So the stone that was placed near the hut was...

590
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,320
Yes. It's Makoto's father's grave.

591
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,420
How come you know so much?

592
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,720
When I came here a year ago,

593
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,820
there was another incident other than this case happening.

594
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,820
Mrs. Kawauchi's daughter who had come here on an interview

595
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,320
went into the forest and never came back.

596
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,620
I heard about it from the person at the inn.

597
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,420
That Mrs. Kawauchi also went inside the forest to look for her.

598
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:03,020
Yes, just when I was about to go to look for her too,

599
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:06,020
her daughter came out of the forest on her own.

600
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,520
She said that Death found her in the forest

601
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,520
and she was chased around.

602
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,820
She was so scared that she kept running around

603
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,620
until she found herself outside the forest.

604
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,620
I figured I had to solve this mystery

605
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,220
before taking care of the murder case,

606
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,420
so I went into the forest.

607
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,020
I found Death, went after him and found that hut.

608
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:28,120
Then, I ran into Makoto who was dressed as Death.

609
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,620
I see.

610
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:33,720
So, you borrowed the outfit that you found in that hut this time.

611
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,920
Yes.

612
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,220
I did so because I had no choice after I fell into the lake

613
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,320
and my clothes got wet.

614
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,820
Besides, with these clothes on everybody fled from me too,

615
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,120
so it turned out to be a great way to hide my face.

616
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:49,020
But I feel sorry for Makoto.

617
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,720
He'll be fine.

618
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,920
It seems that Mrs. Kawauchi wasn't that badly hurt

619
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,820
as we thought she was at first either.

620
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,120
When she finds out who had saved her daughter's life a year ago,

621
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,520
she will be grateful to Death.

622
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,720
Shinichi?

623
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,720
What's the matter, Shinichi?

624
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,420
This is?

625
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,120
Shinichi? What's the wrong?

626
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,520
Oh no, it's come.

627
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,920
Oh no. It's almost 24 hours.

628
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,720
I've got to take Shinichi away from everybody quick.

629
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,020
I almost forgot.

630
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,820
The Inspector had asked Kudo and I to come

631
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,920
and tell him more in detail about the case.

632
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,620
So you guys go on ahead by car and...

633
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,620
No.

634
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,120
I'll go with you too.

635
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,720
I have things that...

636
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,620
I want to ask you too, Shinichi.

637
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,720
Lots and lots of things too!

638
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,820
Ran...

639
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,520
Shinichi?

640
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,520
Kudo?

641
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,720
Are you all right?

642
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:11,620
My body's... my body's hot...

643
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:14,420
Oh no. He's really hot.

644
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,320
If things go as is, I'm going to return to a kid.

645
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,120
I'll transform back to Conan again.

646
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,320
I can't afford to go back

647
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,920
to how was in front of her.

648
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,320
It's his cold, his cold.

649
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,820
Remember he said he fell into the lake?

650
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,620
The cold he had back then got worse.

651
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,220
I guess so, but...

652
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,620
He seems to be suffering abnormally.

653
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,120
What?

654
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,320
You want to go to the john and let out what you have to?

655
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,820
I see! I see!

656
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:47,220
Okay, I'll go take Shinichi to the toilet at the inn,

657
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,920
so Kazuha would you bring my bag and come along.

658
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,020
Why do I have to take your bag?

659
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,020
Change of clothes, I need change of clothes!

660
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,620
Kudo is sweating profusely

661
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,720
so we can't keep him in Death's outfit forever, can we?

662
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,720
So, okay? Bring it for me, will you?

663
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,420
"Okuho Inn"

664
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,820
Twenty four hours?

665
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,320
Are you serious?

666
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:11,220
Yes. The little lady at doctor's place said so.

667
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,520
The drug only stays effective for 24 hours.

668
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:19,720
She told me to bring you back to her before the time is up.

669
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,520
Isn't it almost time?

670
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,120
If you do get small again,

671
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,920
go inside this bag.

672
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:32,820
Then, I'll somehow get you out of here safely.

673
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,520
You can count on me.

674
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,120
Yes.

675
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,320
Heiji?

676
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,420
Kazuha?

677
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,820
What're you sneaking around about?

678
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,620
Stupid, don't come in.

679
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,220
This is the men's room.

680
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,520
But, we're worried about Shinichi.

681
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,920
We brought a doctor that we found in the neighborhood along.

682
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,920
He's fine. He's fine.

683
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,920
Besides, I just gave him some cold medicine now.

684
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,220
What kind of medicine did you give him?

685
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,920
Well, it's a secret potion

686
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,420
that has been handed down in my family for generations.

687
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,820
Darn it.

688
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,420
It always turns out like this.

689
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,620
It always turns out like this!

690
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,920
I always go back being Conan

691
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,720
without being able to say anything to her.

692
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,720
Am I going to have to start all over again?

693
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,570
Shoots.

694
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:45,970
I'm Conan again.

695
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,870
Shinichi? What's wrong?

696
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,570
Hey, don't!

697
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:51,770
Shinichi?

698
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:55,770
Hey, Shinichi?

699
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:58,070
I've to hide in the bag quick.

700
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,970
Shinichi.

701
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,570
Well, so you see...

702
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:04,170
Or, Ran will find out about me.

703
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,670
Shinichi.

704
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,970
Shinichi!

705
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:12,870
Oh no.

706
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,470
The toilet next door?

707
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,770
Who is it?

708
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:24,770
Shinichi, please answer me.

709
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:27,770
I'm telling you he's okay.

710
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:31,870
How can he be okay screaming like that?

711
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,970
Get out of my way.

712
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,870
Please, Heiji!

713
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:39,070
No... Don't...

714
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,370
You idiot.

715
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,470
Kudo?

716
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,570
Shinichi...

717
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,270
What is it? Stop bugging me.

718
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,170
The least you can do is give me peace using the toilet.

719
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,270
How're you feeling?

720
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:06,470
Yes, since I let everything out,

721
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,870
I'm feeling much better.

722
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:12,370
It looks like your fever came down too.

723
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,370
See?

724
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:16,470
I'm glad. I was really worried.

725
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:18,770
Shall we head on home then.

726
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:20,070
Don't we have to go to the police

727
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:23,470
and give them the details of the case?

728
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,770
Well, we can do that after we get home.

729
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,270
True. And just to be on the safe side,

730
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:29,770
you'd better go to the hospital too.

731
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:30,870
Yes.

732
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,770
Okay, let's head home then.

733
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:37,470
I'm very sorry, after you came all this way.

734
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,270
Not at all.

735
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,870
Kudo, what the heck is going on?

736
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,670
I'll tell you later.

737
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,070
Wait, Kudo.

738
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:59,870
We seem to have somehow made it through.

739
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,170
He seems to have regained his memory too.

740
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,470
Yes. What a life saver.

741
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:08,970
Thank god you remembered the name of the inn they were staying at.

742
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:10,370
Good gracious, too, that we were able to assume

743
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:12,570
that if he was cornered,

744
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,470
he would flee into the toilet of the inn.

745
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,770
Ai?

746
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,770
How'd you get here?

747
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:24,670
I've no time to explain.

748
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,870
Just drink this right away.

749
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:30,570
This is, don't tell me...

750
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:35,770
Yes, it's the prototype of the antidote of the APTX 4869

751
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,070
that shrunk your body.

752
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:41,070
It's the same medicine you drank yesterday.

753
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,970
Then, it'll keep for 24 hours?

754
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:44,870
Don't be silly.

755
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,370
Just as when you frequently keep drinking the same medicine,

756
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,670
the effectiveness wears off.

757
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:53,470
Your body builds up resistance to the medicine,

758
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,170
and by taking it repeatedly,

759
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:57,970
the length of time the drug remains effective shortens too.

760
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:00,270
If you want to continue hiding your true identity,

761
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,770
you'll have get out of their sight

762
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:04,370
before the effect of the drug wears off

763
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:06,070
and go back to being Conan Edogawa.

764
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,470
And?

765
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:23,170
What is it that you want to ask me?

766
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:30,470
I just wanted to say thank you for treating my wounds.

767
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:33,070
You're the one who treated them, right?

768
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:37,570
Yes. Since there just happened to be a first aid kit in that mountain.

769
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:41,070
You didn't look, did you?

770
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:45,770
You know when you were treating me...

771
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:50,370
When I was wrapping the bandage around your thighs,

772
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:53,270
I saw the white stuff.

773
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,870
So you did look after all!

774
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,170
How dare you!

775
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,170
You idiot!

776
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:59,170
I didn't look at it because I wanted to,

777
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:00,870
I just happened to see it, you get?

778
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,470
Well, I'm so sorry!

779
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:04,570
That I showed you what you didn't want to see!

780
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:07,770
Ran.

781
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:09,470
Would you like to change seats with me?

782
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:12,070
I think it'll make it easier for both of you to talk.

783
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:15,170
It's okay, Kazuha, stay right there.

784
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:18,370
I'm going to throw that guy over my shoulder after we get home.

785
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:19,670
Give me a break.

786
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:27,170
No. This isn't how it's suppose to turn out.

787
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,770
The thing I wanted to ask Shinichi about was...

788
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:33,170
The thing I really wanted to confirm was...

789
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,370
Ran.

790
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:46,270
Officer Sato and Takagi. What's up?

791
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:48,970
I went to the Kanagawa Prefectural Police Department!

792
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:50,570
And, since I finished doing what I had to do,

793
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:53,070
I'm having my driver drive me home.

794
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:55,270
I'm no more than a driver.

795
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:56,770
What about you people?

796
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:59,870
Did you have any case to solve or something, Mr. Sleeping Kogoro?

797
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:02,470
Yes. Well, sort of.

798
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:06,170
Really? Well, excuse us, since we're in a rush.

799
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:08,570
Tell us about the case some other day then!

800
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:12,470
Since that incident is big news,

801
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:13,970
as long as they read tomorrow's papers they'll find out about it

802
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:15,070
without us telling them about it.

803
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:18,170
No, I don't think it'll be in the papers.

804
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:21,470
Nobody died as a result, and besides,

805
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:23,670
the culprit is still a juvenile.

806
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:26,370
Neither his name nor picture will be publicized.

807
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:29,070
It seems that the newspaper reporter lady who was stabbed,

808
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:31,870
also said that she won't write about it.

809
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:36,270
You were sure lucky, Kudo.

810
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:43,970
What's with that car?

811
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:47,470
It's moving along scraping its body against the guardrail.

812
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:54,970
Maybe he's sleeping at the wheels?

813
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:56,870
If we leave it as is, there's sure to be a big accident.

814
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:07,670
Hey, get up!

815
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:09,270
Hey, you!

816
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:19,470
Hey, something's not right.

817
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:21,470
Get this car in front of that car.

818
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:24,470
Hey! In front, don't tell me that...

819
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:30,670
When you go up front slow down little by little.

820
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:33,470
Idiot! If I do that, the rental car will...

821
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:34,870
Never mind, just hurry.

822
00:45:57,370 --> 00:45:59,670
Gunpei? Gunpei?

823
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:01,870
Hey, wait. Don't touch him.

824
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:03,170
Please step back.

825
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:04,770
Who're you people?

826
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:09,770
-No good. -He's not breathing anymore.

827
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:12,570
Look, Kudo.

828
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:15,470
There's hemorrhaging under his eyes.

829
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:18,070
Don't tell me that this is...

830
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:22,770
a rope mark.

831
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:24,970
Kudo, this is...

832
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:26,570
Hey!

833
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:27,970
What's wrong?

834
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:31,070
Ran. There's a toll gate a kilometer from here.

835
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:33,770
Call Officer Sato and have them block it off.

836
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:35,170
Why?

837
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:38,670
The driver of this car is dead.

838
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,270
He was strangled.

839
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:43,370
Strangled?

840
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:44,770
Yes.

841
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:49,770
In this moving car that's locked.
