1
00:00:03,406 --> 00:00:06,906
There's flood above and a big fire below.

2
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:08,706
What's this?

3
00:00:08,706 --> 00:00:09,989
Hot spring!

4
00:00:10,206 --> 00:00:12,006
Right!

5
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:13,606
The answer is bathtub, right?

6
00:00:13,606 --> 00:00:15,606
Because you don't boil the water of a hot spring.

7
00:00:15,606 --> 00:00:19,106
Well, I don't think they're all that wrong.

8
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:20,806
Because most hot springs are warmed

9
00:00:20,806 --> 00:00:24,406
by the heat of burning magma.

10
00:00:24,406 --> 00:00:27,106
Well, that's true.

11
00:00:27,106 --> 00:00:29,706
But, I wonder what's going on?

12
00:00:29,706 --> 00:00:32,706
Why would Dr. Agasa want to take us to a hot spring?

13
00:00:32,706 --> 00:00:34,806
I'm going over to repair my invention.

14
00:00:34,806 --> 00:00:37,606
The owner of this inn really liked it

15
00:00:37,606 --> 00:00:41,706
and bought a whole lot from me.

16
00:00:41,706 --> 00:00:44,906
It seems that the guests favored them too,

17
00:00:44,906 --> 00:00:47,106
but it seem to have broken down recently.

18
00:00:47,106 --> 00:00:48,806
What kind of thing did you make?

19
00:00:48,806 --> 00:00:51,006
A chair that makes you feel like you took

20
00:00:51,006 --> 00:00:52,506
a hot spring bath just by sitting in it,

21
00:00:52,506 --> 00:00:54,506
as well as the good effects of the hot spring working on your body?

22
00:00:54,506 --> 00:00:55,706
Amazing!

23
00:00:55,706 --> 00:00:58,706
With something like that you don't need hot springs.

24
00:00:58,706 --> 00:01:01,106
Well, I'll keep you in suspense.

25
00:01:02,406 --> 00:01:06,045
Well, I'm sure it's one of his not useful inventions again.

26
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:29,806
Brooding over passing seasons

27
00:01:29,806 --> 00:01:31,806
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

28
00:01:31,806 --> 00:01:33,506
An open-air bath afloat on the lake.

29
00:01:33,506 --> 00:01:35,606
The locked room mystery before dawn.

30
00:01:35,606 --> 00:01:37,206
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:38,906
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:38,906 --> 00:01:41,106
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

33
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:10,971
"Yukemuri Locked Room Scenario (Part 1)"

34
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:17,471
"Hakone Hot Spring Kobo Inn"

35
00:03:28,971 --> 00:03:33,271
The water temperature now is 42.3 C.

36
00:03:33,271 --> 00:03:36,471
The total sulfur content per kg of water

37
00:03:36,471 --> 00:03:39,171
is 25.7 ml.

38
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:42,971
This hot spring is a sulfur spring.

39
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:44,571
It's cute.

40
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:48,207
It's effective for skin disease, arteriosclerosis,

41
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:50,209
-beautiful skin and rheumatism -What kind of doll is it?

42
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:52,571
-as well as neuralgia... -It's a Goemon Ishikawa doll!

43
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:55,671
When it comes to baths it's Goemon Ishikawa, right?

44
00:03:55,671 --> 00:03:58,471
Wasn't he was boiled in an iron pot and executed?

45
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:01,571
If ingested it may also have medicinal effects

46
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:05,371
against... diabetes...

47
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:06,671
gout...

48
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:12,771
constipation...

49
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:21,571
Goemon is totally steamed up.

50
00:04:21,571 --> 00:04:23,671
It seems that the moving part wore out

51
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:25,971
and water leaked inside.

52
00:04:25,971 --> 00:04:28,247
Can you fix it overnight?

53
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:31,471
Yes, since I brought the parts necessary.

54
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,671
This time I'll make them more sturdy and durable.

55
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:34,971
Hey.

56
00:04:34,971 --> 00:04:36,871
You're not finished cleaning yet?

57
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:39,471
It's already after 1 pm.

58
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:41,271
In about another 10 minutes.

59
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:44,263
I tell you! I wanted to try bathing in all five spas

60
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:46,671
here before I shoot the film, and yet...

61
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:48,771
Well, you can take a bath

62
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:50,269
even after we finish the shoot.

63
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:55,871
Aren't you actress Ms. Mishio Natori?

64
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:57,871
Yes, I am.

65
00:04:57,871 --> 00:04:58,971
Just as I thought!

66
00:04:58,971 --> 00:05:00,279
You played the role of the lover

67
00:05:00,471 --> 00:05:03,071
of the very first Masked Yaiba, right?

68
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:05,371
You were very cute.

69
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:09,371
You were always kind to everybody.

70
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:11,471
"Mishio Natori (28)" -I guess I did play a stupid role

71
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:14,293
like that some time in the past.

72
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:16,771
But, that's a story of the past.

73
00:05:16,771 --> 00:05:19,271
I wish you wouldn't remind me of it.

74
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:21,471
She somehow seems different from before.

75
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:23,371
She used to always be smiling.

76
00:05:23,371 --> 00:05:25,171
Is she a snob?

77
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:27,771
Sorry, kids.

78
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:30,309
She's just concentrating on her role now

79
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:32,311
and is a bit annoyed.

80
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:34,071
"Junsaku Tanzawa (34)" -Even I, as manager

81
00:05:34,071 --> 00:05:36,671
find it hard to talk to her.

82
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:39,771
A role? Are you filming a drama or something here?

83
00:05:39,771 --> 00:05:43,171
She did say something about filming a while ago.

84
00:05:43,171 --> 00:05:44,323
Actually...

85
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:48,071
It's a movie that'll be released next year.

86
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:49,871
A supreme masterpiece

87
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:51,571
of the Bloody Smoke Hitman series.

88
00:05:51,571 --> 00:05:53,871
"Ganji Tetsuyama (67)" -Titled Scarlet Wellspring!

89
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:55,371
Of course the scriptwriter is,

90
00:05:55,371 --> 00:05:57,471
yours truly, Ganji Tetsuyama.

91
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:01,271
I guess you brats don't know me.

92
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:04,871
I know, I know.

93
00:06:04,871 --> 00:06:08,871
You're finally going to remake Scarlet Wellspring!

94
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:12,351
What's that? Blood Smoke Hitman?

95
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:14,371
A story about a professional killer.

96
00:06:14,371 --> 00:06:17,271
It is said that he got his name because for some reason,

97
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:18,971
he was asked to do work in the spa district,

98
00:06:18,971 --> 00:06:22,361
and because steam is smeared with blood, people called him by that name.

99
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:25,671
This series is that old man's debut work.

100
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:29,371
It is a story that is separated into the young life edition

101
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:32,371
and elderly life edition of the main character,

102
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:35,271
who is the killer and Scarlet Wellspring is the only title

103
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:37,071
that belongs to the midlife part.

104
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:38,771
If I remember...

105
00:06:38,771 --> 00:06:41,071
the main character quit being a hitman

106
00:06:41,071 --> 00:06:43,471
due to a certain incident

107
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:45,571
but, decided to kill for free for the first time

108
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,071
for a woman owner of an inn.

109
00:06:48,071 --> 00:06:50,971
He schemes up a perfect locked room murder...

110
00:06:50,971 --> 00:06:52,391
I think it was.

111
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:54,171
And, the midlife part,

112
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:56,971
Scarlet Wellspring was filmed just once

113
00:06:56,971 --> 00:06:59,471
in black and white quite some time ago,

114
00:06:59,471 --> 00:07:01,871
but it was never remade because they couldn't find an actor

115
00:07:01,871 --> 00:07:04,403
that was suitable to be the main character.

116
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:06,405
The youth edition and elderly edition

117
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:08,407
were acted out by various actors

118
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:10,771
and remade over and over by many directors though.

119
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:14,413
And...

120
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:17,671
"Unpei Terado (33)" -I, the perfect image of the

121
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:19,771
middle aged hitman appeared.

122
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:22,421
You're here too, Mr. Terado.

123
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:26,771
Yes. I heard the heroine already arrived on site,

124
00:07:26,771 --> 00:07:30,171
so I ditched the manager and flew over.

125
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:32,971
Before the film staff arrives tomorrow...

126
00:07:32,971 --> 00:07:34,433
If only a little bit, I was thinking of becoming intimate

127
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:36,435
with the beautiful heroine.

128
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:43,271
I won't have you doing things to our actress without permission.

129
00:07:43,271 --> 00:07:45,271
Besides the role you're playing

130
00:07:45,271 --> 00:07:48,447
is that of a grief-stricken middle-aged man,

131
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:50,449
exhausted by the business of killing.

132
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:54,453
Not that of a skirt-chasing pervert with undisguised lust, right?

133
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:56,455
Yeah, I know.

134
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,071
That it's a completely different story

135
00:07:58,071 --> 00:08:00,171
from the pompous showoff you

136
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:02,461
played in the youth edition.

137
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:04,071
I see.

138
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:06,771
I thought you looked familiar.

139
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:09,671
You're the actor, Mr. Junsaku Tanzawa!

140
00:08:09,671 --> 00:08:11,771
Yes.

141
00:08:11,771 --> 00:08:14,771
You were great as the hitman.

142
00:08:14,771 --> 00:08:17,871
You should do the midlife edition too!

143
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:19,471
Hey, hey...

144
00:08:19,471 --> 00:08:23,871
No. I've taken a break from acting for personal reasons.

145
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:27,271
But you could be dragged back into acting again.

146
00:08:27,271 --> 00:08:29,971
Being that the cast could be completely changed

147
00:08:29,971 --> 00:08:32,771
on a whim by our great scriptwriter here.

148
00:08:32,771 --> 00:08:35,771
Yes, true.

149
00:08:35,771 --> 00:08:39,271
I already have two or three actors in mind as your substitute.

150
00:08:39,271 --> 00:08:42,071
Depending on your performance a change could occur.

151
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:43,571
What?

152
00:08:43,571 --> 00:08:46,771
Of course, that goes for you too, Ms. Natori.

153
00:08:46,771 --> 00:08:48,171
I'm not surprised.

154
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:50,971
Well... Take a slow nice bath in the spa.

155
00:08:50,971 --> 00:08:53,071
Cleanse your body well, and perform your role

156
00:08:53,071 --> 00:08:55,571
as the woman owner of the inn as best you can.

157
00:08:55,571 --> 00:08:58,271
There is a romantic sexy "wet" scene too, you know!

158
00:09:00,171 --> 00:09:02,521
What's a "wet" scene?

159
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:03,371
What?

160
00:09:03,371 --> 00:09:05,471
I think she's going to take a bath?

161
00:09:05,471 --> 00:09:08,971
I see, if so, she'll get wet.

162
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:11,571
Well, I guess I'll leave it at that.

163
00:09:17,771 --> 00:09:19,871
Is something wrong with his leg?

164
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,271
Yes. He seems to have injured his tendon

165
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,071
a few years ago.

166
00:09:24,071 --> 00:09:26,271
He's been walking that way ever since,

167
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,471
according to a documentary TV program.

168
00:09:29,471 --> 00:09:31,571
Now that we've come all this way,

169
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,171
we should try the specialty of this hot spring inn

170
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:36,971
and take a dip in the open-air bath on the lake, okay?

171
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:38,557
What's that?

172
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:40,271
Literally, an open-air spa

173
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:44,071
with a great scenic view built on a lake!

174
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:47,571
They only have it here, and at the Hawaii Hot Spring in Tottori!

175
00:09:47,571 --> 00:09:51,071
Awesome!

176
00:09:51,071 --> 00:09:54,571
But, why is the women's bath bigger?

177
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:56,571
It seems they switch the men and women's

178
00:09:56,571 --> 00:09:58,577
bath after the cleaning at noon.

179
00:09:58,577 --> 00:09:59,871
See you!

180
00:09:59,871 --> 00:10:00,871
Okay!

181
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:02,071
See you later!

182
00:10:07,871 --> 00:10:11,271
It looks crowded.

183
00:10:11,271 --> 00:10:13,471
The women's side is filled too.

184
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:14,871
It can't be helped.

185
00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:17,471
Let's come back first thing in the morning.

186
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,071
In the morning the men's bath is larger.

187
00:10:20,071 --> 00:10:23,771
And it'll be nice taking a dip while watching the sunrise.

188
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:25,471
-Okay! -I guess so!

189
00:10:27,071 --> 00:10:29,071
It's no wonder it's cold,

190
00:10:29,071 --> 00:10:31,071
since we're atop of the lake exposed to the wind.

191
00:10:31,071 --> 00:10:33,171
Let's hurry back to the room.

192
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,771
So you've finally decided to do it.

193
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:43,671
The open-air bath on the lake

194
00:10:43,671 --> 00:10:45,971
with the morning sun shining down.

195
00:10:45,971 --> 00:10:49,471
Sounds great, just great.

196
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,071
The man playing the lead role?

197
00:10:51,071 --> 00:10:52,631
If you don't care for him,

198
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:54,071
we could make a switch.

199
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:10,371
What's wrong, Mishio?

200
00:11:10,371 --> 00:11:13,071
I think I heard something crack.

201
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:15,571
Is anything wrong?

202
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:16,655
It's nothing!

203
00:11:16,871 --> 00:11:18,171
Leave me alone!

204
00:11:32,271 --> 00:11:35,471
Why me?

205
00:11:35,471 --> 00:11:37,571
It's the manager we saw yesterday.

206
00:11:40,371 --> 00:11:41,871
You're an early bird, aren't you?

207
00:11:41,871 --> 00:11:43,871
It' still 4:30 am.

208
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,471
Bug you, brat.

209
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,971
I'm back.

210
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:56,971
What took you so long, Conan?

211
00:11:56,971 --> 00:12:00,071
How long is it going to take you to buy drinks?

212
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:02,701
It's because you made me go buy the drinks all alone.

213
00:12:02,871 --> 00:12:05,171
And, telling me to buy different kinds too.

214
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:08,707
It's your fault for being weak at playing stone, paper, scissors.

215
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:10,471
The man who was smoking the pipe yesterday

216
00:12:10,471 --> 00:12:12,171
is already heading for the bath.

217
00:12:12,171 --> 00:12:14,071
-What? -See, over there.

218
00:12:14,071 --> 00:12:16,715
He's crossing the wharf.

219
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:19,371
It's supposed to start at 5 am in the morning, right?

220
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,671
It's 4:43 am right now.

221
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:23,671
It's a violation.

222
00:12:23,671 --> 00:12:25,371
Let's go too.

223
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:30,729
I guess we'll let Dr. Agasa sleep.

224
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:33,671
I guess so. Since he was repairing until late last night too.

225
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:36,735
What?

226
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,871
How come that gramps get to go and we don't?

227
00:12:39,871 --> 00:12:42,741
Well, that man is an honored guest

228
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,743
so he gets special privileges.

229
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:49,071
But, it's only 10 more minutes to 5 am.

230
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:51,771
Right. I guess we can let them in.

231
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,671
All right!

232
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:56,371
Hey! Running is dangerous!

233
00:13:02,071 --> 00:13:04,171
It's been three days since I last took a bath.

234
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:08,371
Wash your body clean before going into the tub.

235
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,471
Understood.

236
00:13:13,471 --> 00:13:16,771
The clothes of that old man is nowhere in sight.

237
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:32,371
What's the matter, Ayumi?

238
00:13:33,571 --> 00:13:35,771
Don't tell me that something happened inside?

239
00:13:35,771 --> 00:13:37,271
Not you guys!

240
00:13:37,271 --> 00:13:38,271
What?

241
00:13:39,271 --> 00:13:40,799
What?

242
00:13:40,971 --> 00:13:42,801
Why...

243
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:46,271
is that old man in the women's bath?

244
00:13:46,271 --> 00:13:47,871
Is it an accident?

245
00:13:47,871 --> 00:13:51,271
No. This is homicide.

246
00:13:51,271 --> 00:13:53,571
Moreover...

247
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:55,071
A locked room murder!

248
00:14:05,232 --> 00:14:06,825
Is something wrong?

249
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:08,132
How should I know.

250
00:14:08,132 --> 00:14:11,132
I came to take a bath at this open-air stall on the lake,

251
00:14:11,132 --> 00:14:13,532
but those children won't let me through.

252
00:14:13,532 --> 00:14:16,532
That's because we were told not to let anyone through.

253
00:14:16,532 --> 00:14:18,837
By Conan.

254
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:22,632
Hey, is he dead?

255
00:14:22,632 --> 00:14:24,232
Yes.

256
00:14:24,232 --> 00:14:25,432
He's not breathing.

257
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:27,432
No way.

258
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:30,632
You called the police, didn't you?

259
00:14:30,632 --> 00:14:31,632
Yes.

260
00:14:33,232 --> 00:14:36,032
Mr. Tetsuyama.

261
00:14:36,032 --> 00:14:37,632
Why is he...

262
00:14:37,632 --> 00:14:39,432
-Mr. Tetsuyama! -Don't touch!

263
00:14:39,432 --> 00:14:41,432
Mr. Tetsuyama!

264
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:45,432
The cause of death is acute subdural hematoma

265
00:14:45,432 --> 00:14:47,232
due to a violent blow on the back of the head

266
00:14:47,232 --> 00:14:49,332
in addition to cerebral contusion.

267
00:14:49,332 --> 00:14:50,869
The estimated time of death

268
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:52,532
is around 5 am this morning.

269
00:14:52,532 --> 00:14:55,732
The lather on the sole of the victim's feet

270
00:14:55,732 --> 00:14:59,232
and the residue of lather on the tile at his feet.

271
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,732
In addition, judging from the bar of soap

272
00:15:01,732 --> 00:15:04,883
on the other side of his feet.

273
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:06,332
It seems to have flown there...

274
00:15:06,332 --> 00:15:07,432
He seems to have accidentally stepped

275
00:15:07,432 --> 00:15:09,232
on it when coming out of the tub,

276
00:15:09,232 --> 00:15:10,889
slipped and fell.

277
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:14,232
Then hit his head on the rocks around the tub.

278
00:15:14,232 --> 00:15:16,895
I guess it's safe to say that this is an accidental death.

279
00:15:17,132 --> 00:15:19,532
But, isn't it strange?

280
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:21,332
This is the women's bath, you know?

281
00:15:21,332 --> 00:15:23,832
This brat again.

282
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:26,632
I thought it strange too, but...

283
00:15:26,632 --> 00:15:28,907
This old man headed for the open-air bath

284
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:30,932
at a little after 4:30 am,

285
00:15:30,932 --> 00:15:32,911
and the surroundings was still dark,

286
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:35,732
so he just probably just mistook the women's bath for the men's.

287
00:15:35,732 --> 00:15:40,432
We came here after this old man came here too

288
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:42,932
but we could clearly read the character

289
00:15:42,932 --> 00:15:45,332
on the curtain as being women or men.

290
00:15:45,332 --> 00:15:48,232
Then, you met them too, didn't you?

291
00:15:48,232 --> 00:15:50,232
The two employees who were at the entrance

292
00:15:50,232 --> 00:15:52,931
going from the main building to the wharf.

293
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:54,933
Those two said that the only one

294
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:56,532
who passed the entrance

295
00:15:56,532 --> 00:15:59,332
before you children came was

296
00:15:59,332 --> 00:16:02,132
this old man.

297
00:16:02,132 --> 00:16:04,932
If you're the ones who came after the old man,

298
00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:06,332
and found his dead body,

299
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,632
what else could it be but an accident?

300
00:16:08,632 --> 00:16:10,632
But, take a look

301
00:16:10,632 --> 00:16:13,832
at the collarbone of the old man.

302
00:16:13,832 --> 00:16:15,432
There's a pool of water there.

303
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:18,957
See, by his belly button too

304
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:20,232
Right.

305
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:23,832
If he fell hard enough to die from hitting his head,

306
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:25,432
then any water that was left

307
00:16:25,432 --> 00:16:26,965
on his body would've flown off, right?

308
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:28,432
True.

309
00:16:28,432 --> 00:16:31,632
Maybe after the old man fell down somebody

310
00:16:31,632 --> 00:16:35,632
splashed water on him and tried to wash something off.

311
00:16:35,632 --> 00:16:38,532
Wash off... what?

312
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:41,832
I see, blood!

313
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:44,232
The unnatural spray of blood that splattered on his shoulders and back,

314
00:16:44,232 --> 00:16:45,932
when he was initially struck.

315
00:16:45,932 --> 00:16:46,985
After hitting his head against the rock

316
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:48,987
by the spa in order to finish him off,

317
00:16:48,987 --> 00:16:50,332
the killer washed the blood off

318
00:16:50,332 --> 00:16:54,332
to make it look like an accident.

319
00:16:54,332 --> 00:16:55,932
Hey, hold it!

320
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,932
When you found the body,

321
00:16:57,932 --> 00:17:00,432
there was no one else here except for you,

322
00:17:00,432 --> 00:17:02,332
kids, was there?

323
00:17:02,332 --> 00:17:03,332
No.

324
00:17:03,332 --> 00:17:05,003
I didn't hear a loud sound like somebody

325
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:07,632
jumped into the lake either.

326
00:17:07,632 --> 00:17:12,332
Which means that this outdoor spa on the lake...

327
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:14,532
is completely sealed off!

328
00:17:15,732 --> 00:17:18,532
An impossible crime, right?

329
00:17:18,532 --> 00:17:21,032
That's why we have to solve that mystery first.

330
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:23,432
Yeah, that's right.

331
00:17:23,432 --> 00:17:24,532
Hey!

332
00:17:24,532 --> 00:17:27,532
Don't spout off pretending to be a police detective, you brat!

333
00:17:27,532 --> 00:17:30,732
Hey! Call the forensics back here!

334
00:17:30,732 --> 00:17:33,031
We're going to thoroughly re-investigate this case again!

335
00:17:33,232 --> 00:17:34,632
Yes, sir!

336
00:17:34,632 --> 00:17:36,232
That hurt.

337
00:17:36,232 --> 00:17:39,037
And, Conan...

338
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:40,232
How was it?

339
00:17:40,232 --> 00:17:41,932
You saw, didn't you?

340
00:17:41,932 --> 00:17:43,041
See what?

341
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:46,232
You know... "that", "that".

342
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,632
Ayumi screamed really loud, right?

343
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:50,032
Yeah, I saw.

344
00:17:50,032 --> 00:17:51,049
I thought so...

345
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:52,332
You saw?

346
00:17:52,332 --> 00:17:54,032
Yeah, I sure did.

347
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,532
It's natural because after all,

348
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,832
everybody comes here to take a bath.

349
00:17:56,832 --> 00:17:59,332
Totally naked and exposed.

350
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:01,532
Naked and...

351
00:18:01,532 --> 00:18:02,832
Exposed?

352
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,132
How dare you!

353
00:18:04,132 --> 00:18:06,432
Conan, you dumb, dumb!

354
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:07,532
What?

355
00:18:07,532 --> 00:18:09,332
You guys saw too, didn't you?

356
00:18:09,332 --> 00:18:10,632
The dead body of the old man.

357
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:11,932
What?

358
00:18:11,932 --> 00:18:13,532
Just what are you guys talking about?

359
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:16,432
So... if it's the dead body of that old man,

360
00:18:16,432 --> 00:18:18,332
we saw him too.

361
00:18:18,332 --> 00:18:20,832
Just a little bit after the police came.

362
00:18:20,832 --> 00:18:25,083
No way. You guys didn't come inside.

363
00:18:25,332 --> 00:18:27,085
We saw from outside!

364
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:28,832
What?

365
00:18:28,832 --> 00:18:32,532
You see, we went pass this corridor

366
00:18:32,532 --> 00:18:35,532
and slipped by beside the outdoor ventilator of the ventilation fan

367
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:38,632
then climbed over this fence.

368
00:18:38,632 --> 00:18:40,732
See, you can see, can't you?

369
00:18:44,132 --> 00:18:47,105
Hey, you brats, where the heck did you...

370
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:50,532
The veranda here is connected to the corridor outside.

371
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,132
What?

372
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,632
Moreover, taking into consideration

373
00:18:54,632 --> 00:18:57,115
this glass window has no lock.

374
00:18:57,115 --> 00:18:58,432
I see.

375
00:18:58,432 --> 00:19:00,632
If the culprit hid in a blind spot of the corridor

376
00:19:00,632 --> 00:19:05,432
before the outdoor spa closed the night before at 11 pm,

377
00:19:05,432 --> 00:19:08,732
after he killed the old man who came along early in the morning,

378
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,832
he could've gone through the corridor

379
00:19:10,832 --> 00:19:14,532
from the veranda and mingled within the crowd

380
00:19:14,532 --> 00:19:15,832
that couldn't make it inside.

381
00:19:15,832 --> 00:19:17,135
That's right.

382
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:20,132
Why not start by picking out guests

383
00:19:20,132 --> 00:19:22,932
who came here to the outdoor spa on the lake alone,

384
00:19:22,932 --> 00:19:25,932
without telling anyone?

385
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:28,432
The killer could be among those guests.

386
00:19:28,432 --> 00:19:30,232
Yes.

387
00:19:32,232 --> 00:19:38,732
So, the ones who came to this outdoor spa alone without telling anyone

388
00:19:38,732 --> 00:19:40,732
turned out to be only you three,

389
00:19:40,732 --> 00:19:45,163
who happened to be connected with the late Mr. Ganji Tetsuyama.

390
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:48,832
Well, the rest of the guests were mostly family

391
00:19:48,832 --> 00:19:52,332
and the only ones who stayed over alone

392
00:19:52,332 --> 00:19:54,232
were Mr. Tetsuyama and you people.

393
00:19:54,232 --> 00:19:57,175
While taking out your personal belongings

394
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:59,732
tell me where and what you were doing at around 5 am,

395
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:03,181
the estimated time of his death?

396
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:05,183
Let's start with the heroine of the movie

397
00:20:05,432 --> 00:20:08,032
that Mr. Tetsuyama wrote the script for,

398
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:10,532
Ms. Mishio Natori.

399
00:20:10,532 --> 00:20:12,532
I don't know what you're trying to get at

400
00:20:12,532 --> 00:20:14,132
but the only things I have with me

401
00:20:14,132 --> 00:20:17,195
is this pouch with make-up inside and a towel.

402
00:20:17,432 --> 00:20:19,832
My room key is at the front desk.

403
00:20:19,832 --> 00:20:22,332
I was told to leave it with the front desk

404
00:20:22,332 --> 00:20:24,332
before going to the outdoor spa.

405
00:20:24,332 --> 00:20:27,532
I just got up at about 5 am.

406
00:20:27,532 --> 00:20:29,832
And I came here at about 5 am

407
00:20:29,832 --> 00:20:31,209
because I was told that I could take a bath

408
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:33,232
while watching the sunrise.

409
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,532
I like hot springs.

410
00:20:36,532 --> 00:20:39,232
And, your relationship with Mr. Tetsuyama,

411
00:20:39,232 --> 00:20:42,532
was it just one between a scriptwriter and an actress?

412
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,932
-Yes. -Don't lie.

413
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:49,227
It seemed Mr. Tetsuyama was making passes at you.

414
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:51,229
There's rumor going around

415
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:55,233
that you got the heroine part this time by becoming the great his lover.

416
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:58,332
What? I got the part because of my acting expertise!

417
00:20:58,332 --> 00:21:01,239
I'm not you, who had to beg for a role

418
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:03,532
to get to become a candidate for the starring role.

419
00:21:03,532 --> 00:21:07,245
Candidate? It's been decided that I play the leading part!

420
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:12,032
And? Lead actor, where and what were you doing at around 5 am?

421
00:21:12,032 --> 00:21:14,332
I was sleeping at that time.

422
00:21:14,332 --> 00:21:18,032
I came here to take a bath at a little before 6 am.

423
00:21:18,032 --> 00:21:19,932
The only things I have on me are a towel,

424
00:21:19,932 --> 00:21:22,632
cigarettes and my room key.

425
00:21:22,632 --> 00:21:25,732
Didn't you leave your room key at the front desk?

426
00:21:25,732 --> 00:21:27,732
Too much hassle.

427
00:21:27,732 --> 00:21:29,032
I also brought my key along with me

428
00:21:29,032 --> 00:21:31,269
instead of leaving it at the front desk.

429
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:33,032
Because I just went to look for her,

430
00:21:33,032 --> 00:21:35,932
since she didn't return to her room for quite some time.

431
00:21:35,932 --> 00:21:40,432
So, all I have with me are my room key, wallet and cell phone.

432
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:43,632
At around 5 am I was watching TV in my room.

433
00:21:43,632 --> 00:21:46,332
Watching TV at 5 am. You're an early riser.

434
00:21:46,332 --> 00:21:47,632
Yes.

435
00:21:47,632 --> 00:21:49,832
I was actually up at about a little pass 4 am.

436
00:21:49,832 --> 00:21:51,289
And I went to the front desk around 4:30 am

437
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:53,291
to get some loose change.

438
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,632
Did you need the loose change to buy canned coffee?

439
00:21:58,832 --> 00:22:00,132
You're an early bird, aren't you?

440
00:22:00,132 --> 00:22:02,132
It' still 4:30 am.

441
00:22:02,132 --> 00:22:03,732
Bug you, brat.

442
00:22:05,303 --> 00:22:08,332
I saw you at around 4:30 am in front of the vending machine, right?

443
00:22:08,332 --> 00:22:09,832
Yes.

444
00:22:09,832 --> 00:22:12,832
Which means Manager Tanzawa,

445
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:17,315
you couldn't have hidden yourself here all night to ambush

446
00:22:17,315 --> 00:22:19,317
and murder Mr. Tetsuyama.

447
00:22:19,317 --> 00:22:21,032
Murder...

448
00:22:21,032 --> 00:22:22,732
Wasn't it an accident?

449
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:24,332
Are you serious?

450
00:22:24,332 --> 00:22:28,632
Yes. Although I can't say for sure yet.

451
00:22:30,132 --> 00:22:32,732
The killer is among the three.

452
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:40,232
The one who killed Mr. Tetsuyama.

453
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

454
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,423
"Ring".

455
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,700
Look after your rear end next week.

456
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,960
Just what do you mean?
