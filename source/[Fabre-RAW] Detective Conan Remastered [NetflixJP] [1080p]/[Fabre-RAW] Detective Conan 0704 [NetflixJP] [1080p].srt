1
00:00:02,144 --> 00:00:05,544
I participated in the Bell Tree Express event

2
00:00:05,544 --> 00:00:07,144
with the members of the Youth Detective Squad,

3
00:00:07,144 --> 00:00:09,244
Ran and the others.

4
00:00:09,244 --> 00:00:13,993
Suspicious passengers are gathered in car number 8.

5
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:17,644
The deduction quiz that is held on the train,

6
00:00:17,644 --> 00:00:21,544
in the wink of an eye turns into a locked room murder.

7
00:00:23,644 --> 00:00:26,844
In the meantime, a black shadow closes in on Haibara.

8
00:00:26,844 --> 00:00:31,344
Moreover, who is the man with the burn that kidnapped Sera?

9
00:00:36,544 --> 00:00:38,344
Aim for a 100% solution.

10
00:00:38,344 --> 00:00:40,544
Clear all mysteries and codes.

11
00:00:40,544 --> 00:00:42,544
The train is in panic because of their trap.

12
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:45,044
Haibara's fate hangs in the balance!

13
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,644
He sees through the one and only truth.

14
00:00:46,644 --> 00:00:48,644
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult!

15
00:00:48,644 --> 00:00:51,344
His name is Detective Conan!

16
00:02:31,196 --> 00:02:36,896
"Pitch Black Mystery Express Train (Last Stop)"

17
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:40,496
But, Detective...

18
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:43,896
Don't you think that your deduction's a bit too far out?

19
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:48,147
It's not easy to increase a loop in the chain lock

20
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:51,096
and if the bulb of the lamp of my room wasn't burnt out,

21
00:02:51,096 --> 00:02:53,696
I wouldn't be able to call the conductor to my room, would I?

22
00:02:53,696 --> 00:02:55,896
The only reason why I called the conductor

23
00:02:55,896 --> 00:02:57,796
was because the alarm of the wristwatch

24
00:02:57,796 --> 00:03:00,159
that was forgotten in my room coincidentally went off.

25
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,796
Conductor, you mentioned earlier

26
00:03:03,796 --> 00:03:07,496
that one of your uniforms were missing, didn't you?

27
00:03:07,496 --> 00:03:08,696
Yes.

28
00:03:08,696 --> 00:03:13,096
Mr. Ando is probably the one who stole it.

29
00:03:13,096 --> 00:03:14,596
If he wore the uniform and got himself mixed up

30
00:03:14,596 --> 00:03:16,996
in the examination of the train before boarding,

31
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,496
it would have been possible for him

32
00:03:19,496 --> 00:03:21,496
to change the chain lock at the scene of the crime,

33
00:03:21,496 --> 00:03:24,183
or change the burnt out lamp of Mr. Noto's room

34
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:27,696
or hide the wristwatch in Ms. Idenami's room.

35
00:03:27,696 --> 00:03:30,189
Moreover, if Mr. Ando used a remote controller

36
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:31,796
to ring the alarm of the wristwatch again

37
00:03:31,796 --> 00:03:33,796
while Ms. Idenami and the conductor

38
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,696
were arguing to distract them,

39
00:03:35,696 --> 00:03:38,196
even if Mr. Ando who was hiding in room B

40
00:03:38,196 --> 00:03:40,199
were to use the fishing line to open the door of room C

41
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:42,201
that he had covered the door with the mirrors with,

42
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:44,203
no one would've noticed.

43
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:46,205
After he chain locked room B,

44
00:03:46,396 --> 00:03:48,896
hiding behind the door where he had placed the mirrors on,

45
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,996
if he closes the door and pretends to have

46
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:52,996
come out of his own room

47
00:03:52,996 --> 00:03:55,796
and walk towards Ms. Idenami.

48
00:03:55,796 --> 00:03:56,796
Despite the conductor

49
00:03:56,796 --> 00:03:59,396
having been in the corridor right through,

50
00:03:59,396 --> 00:04:01,096
a situation is created where no one

51
00:04:01,096 --> 00:04:05,496
was seen going in or out of the crime scene.

52
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:06,896
Well, but unfortunately,

53
00:04:06,896 --> 00:04:09,296
just before he was about to open the mirrored door,

54
00:04:09,296 --> 00:04:11,796
Ms. Komino and her maid came along the corridor.

55
00:04:11,796 --> 00:04:14,896
There was a chance that they would've notice the fishing line,

56
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:16,896
but in the darkness of the tunnel,

57
00:04:16,896 --> 00:04:18,696
it probably slipped their notice.

58
00:04:18,696 --> 00:04:21,096
Don't tell me that you deliberately didn't mention this

59
00:04:21,096 --> 00:04:24,596
because you didn't want to become involved?

60
00:04:24,596 --> 00:04:27,996
But, why would Mr. Ando kill Mr. Murobashi?

61
00:04:27,996 --> 00:04:29,296
Weren't you supposed to be friends

62
00:04:29,296 --> 00:04:31,996
that were rescued from the fire that occurred five years ago?

63
00:04:31,996 --> 00:04:36,255
Yes. I thought so until two years ago,

64
00:04:36,255 --> 00:04:37,996
until I saw that picture

65
00:04:37,996 --> 00:04:41,896
that was supposed to have burned in the fire at an auction.

66
00:04:41,896 --> 00:04:43,196
What?

67
00:04:43,196 --> 00:04:46,796
I searched for the owner of the picture

68
00:04:46,796 --> 00:04:50,696
and ended up seeing Murobashi's name.

69
00:04:50,696 --> 00:04:52,271
I see.

70
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:54,996
Mr. Murobashi stole the picture from the house,

71
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:56,275
and in order to hide what he did,

72
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,796
he set fire to the house?

73
00:04:58,796 --> 00:05:01,496
As a result many people fell victim.

74
00:05:01,496 --> 00:05:04,283
Yes. If that guy,

75
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:06,285
like us, was boarding this train every year

76
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:08,796
to pray that the souls of the people

77
00:05:08,796 --> 00:05:12,291
who died in the fire would rest at peace,

78
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:15,096
I would've urged him to turn himself in.

79
00:05:15,096 --> 00:05:17,496
But while we were waiting to play

80
00:05:17,496 --> 00:05:21,296
the fake roles of the deduction quiz,

81
00:05:21,296 --> 00:05:22,696
he, the victim, me the culprit,

82
00:05:22,696 --> 00:05:25,096
and the children the detective,

83
00:05:25,096 --> 00:05:27,796
that guy said this.

84
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:30,796
This kind of thing is exciting after all!

85
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:33,596
I mean I really feel alive.

86
00:05:33,596 --> 00:05:36,796
Don't you recall the fire that we barely

87
00:05:36,796 --> 00:05:38,796
made out alive from?

88
00:05:41,496 --> 00:05:43,896
That guy said so in sheer delight,

89
00:05:43,896 --> 00:05:46,696
reddening his cheeks!

90
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:48,996
My wife was caught up in smoke

91
00:05:48,996 --> 00:05:52,331
and died in that fire too, and yet...

92
00:05:55,496 --> 00:05:56,996
Yukiko.

93
00:05:56,996 --> 00:05:59,896
You seem to want to cast a smokescreen over us.

94
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:01,496
You people got no chance.

95
00:06:01,496 --> 00:06:02,796
Oh, yes, we have!

96
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:06,345
Because Shinichi's got a hold of your weak point, Sharon.

97
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:07,496
Don't tell me that

98
00:06:07,496 --> 00:06:10,349
you think my hands are tied because we're friends?

99
00:06:10,596 --> 00:06:13,996
I don't think your friends know, Sharon?

100
00:06:13,996 --> 00:06:15,796
That Shinichi and that girl have become children

101
00:06:15,796 --> 00:06:18,996
because of the drug?

102
00:06:18,996 --> 00:06:21,496
If you narrow down the search to elementary school children,

103
00:06:21,496 --> 00:06:25,196
it'll be a matter of time before you find them.

104
00:06:25,196 --> 00:06:27,596
Shinichi said that

105
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,896
you may have a reason for hiding the fact

106
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:34,373
that you know about this.

107
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:36,896
And what about...

108
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:40,096
Suguru Itakura?

109
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:41,896
You know him, don't you?

110
00:06:41,896 --> 00:06:43,396
The computer graphics creator

111
00:06:43,396 --> 00:06:46,096
who was working on special visual effect that we,

112
00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:48,996
the actresses were all acquainted with.

113
00:06:48,996 --> 00:06:51,196
I was surprised to hear from Shinichi

114
00:06:51,196 --> 00:06:54,996
that you ordered some kind of system from him.

115
00:06:54,996 --> 00:06:57,696
My fellow performers were saying that

116
00:06:57,696 --> 00:06:59,896
both of you were clashed during a certain movie

117
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:01,596
and are on bad terms.

118
00:07:01,596 --> 00:07:03,096
I'm sure that you changed your voice

119
00:07:03,096 --> 00:07:04,696
when you called him to make your request,

120
00:07:04,696 --> 00:07:07,396
as would be expected of you.

121
00:07:07,396 --> 00:07:10,409
The system that you went out of your way to order from him.

122
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,096
Does it have something to do with

123
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:14,413
the fact that the two have changed into children?

124
00:07:14,596 --> 00:07:17,196
Yukiko, that's enough.

125
00:07:19,196 --> 00:07:20,796
Stay out of this!

126
00:07:20,796 --> 00:07:24,196
Your stupid plan is all figured out already.

127
00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:26,896
Plan? Just what are you talking about?

128
00:07:27,396 --> 00:07:30,896
If she realizes that we're on board this train,

129
00:07:30,896 --> 00:07:34,196
there's only one thing she would do.

130
00:07:34,196 --> 00:07:36,096
She'd drink the antidote of that drug

131
00:07:36,096 --> 00:07:38,437
and return to her previous self.

132
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:41,796
If she is killed as a child

133
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:44,443
and her body is found in the train,

134
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:47,996
those children will cry and make a big fuss.

135
00:07:47,996 --> 00:07:51,196
On the other hand, if she returns to her true self,

136
00:07:51,196 --> 00:07:53,596
even if her body were to be found,

137
00:07:53,596 --> 00:07:55,496
for the children, the dead body

138
00:07:55,496 --> 00:07:58,457
would be that of a woman they just met once.

139
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:00,459
The children would be more worried about Ai's disappearance

140
00:08:00,696 --> 00:08:02,461
that they would not dwell on the incident.

141
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:06,096
That would also distract the Organization from the matter.

142
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:07,896
Well, I don't think that

143
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:10,996
your son or Dr. Agasa would think that way though.

144
00:08:10,996 --> 00:08:13,196
They would never be able to say that

145
00:08:13,196 --> 00:08:18,477
the woman's body is Ai's previous body.

146
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:20,479
Right. I'm sure that

147
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,296
you would assume that she would act that way,

148
00:08:23,296 --> 00:08:24,483
and so you would try to get a hold of her

149
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:25,896
before she drinks the drug.

150
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:27,096
Then, you'd disguise yourself

151
00:08:27,096 --> 00:08:28,487
as what she previously looked to be,

152
00:08:28,696 --> 00:08:30,996
pretend that you were killed by us

153
00:08:30,996 --> 00:08:33,396
and deceive the eyes of the Organization this way.

154
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:34,996
Is that what you were planning to do?

155
00:08:34,996 --> 00:08:38,896
If she's not hidden here in your room,

156
00:08:38,896 --> 00:08:40,096
it seems that

157
00:08:40,096 --> 00:08:42,501
you haven't been able to get a hold of her yet.

158
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:44,503
Just what are you talking about?

159
00:08:44,696 --> 00:08:47,596
The trunk you threw out of the window a while ago.

160
00:08:47,596 --> 00:08:49,396
You looked inside, didn't you?

161
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:52,096
Did you see any outfits for disguise in there?

162
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:53,296
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:53,796 --> 00:08:56,796
I got rid of the contents before I threw the trunk out.

164
00:08:59,096 --> 00:09:01,296
I also threw out the disguise outfits that were hidden

165
00:09:01,296 --> 00:09:02,996
under this water basin too.

166
00:09:02,996 --> 00:09:06,525
Even the bullet proof jacket with the blood trick on it!

167
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:09,396
But, if you haven't found her yet either,

168
00:09:09,396 --> 00:09:11,096
aren't we still even?

169
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:14,533
No problem. Don't worry.

170
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:18,537
We're prepared to smoke her out already.

171
00:09:29,196 --> 00:09:32,196
Mr. Ando, please finish up at the police.

172
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:35,896
Hey, what is it? That smoke?

173
00:09:35,896 --> 00:09:36,896
Hey, don't tell me...

174
00:09:36,896 --> 00:09:38,557
I'll go check.

175
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:42,561
Fire?

176
00:09:42,796 --> 00:09:44,563
It's a fire!

177
00:09:45,296 --> 00:09:48,296
Everybody, hurry and evacuate to the car in front!

178
00:09:49,796 --> 00:09:52,096
Pops! Wake up!

179
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:53,496
Hurry up, grannies!

180
00:09:53,496 --> 00:09:54,573
Yes.

181
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:55,996
Emergency!

182
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:59,596
A fire has broken out in car number 8 of this train!

183
00:09:59,596 --> 00:10:01,696
Passengers in car number 7 and 6,

184
00:10:01,696 --> 00:10:04,896
please evacuate to the car in front just in case!

185
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,896
This is car number 6, isn't it?

186
00:10:06,896 --> 00:10:07,996
Yep.

187
00:10:07,996 --> 00:10:09,696
We've got to get out of here then.

188
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:11,396
Please calm down everyone!

189
00:10:11,396 --> 00:10:13,796
There's no need to hurry.

190
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:24,296
Just as I thought,

191
00:10:24,296 --> 00:10:25,596
the passengers of car number 8

192
00:10:25,596 --> 00:10:27,796
are all fire phobic.

193
00:10:27,796 --> 00:10:30,609
Thanks to them, there's great panic.

194
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,296
Sure looks it.

195
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:34,196
Here's a question for you!

196
00:10:34,196 --> 00:10:37,696
Where do you think she'd go in this situation?

197
00:10:37,696 --> 00:10:41,596
Well, I'm sure she'll flee to the car in front.

198
00:10:41,596 --> 00:10:43,896
No, just the opposite.

199
00:10:43,896 --> 00:10:46,296
She'd probably...

200
00:11:08,996 --> 00:11:12,651
Just as would be expected of Hell Angel's daughter.

201
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:14,653
You look alike.

202
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:20,096
How do you do?

203
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:26,665
Bourbon. This is my code name.

204
00:11:38,188 --> 00:11:39,388
Oh, Mr. Mouri!

205
00:11:39,388 --> 00:11:41,888
Dad! Where're Conan and Sera?

206
00:11:41,888 --> 00:11:42,988
Huh?

207
00:11:42,988 --> 00:11:45,588
I was with that glasses boy till a while ago but...

208
00:11:45,588 --> 00:11:46,685
If you're talking about that tomboy,

209
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:49,288
she left to go over to your place quite some time ago!

210
00:11:49,288 --> 00:11:51,888
-Huh? -She didn't come!

211
00:11:51,888 --> 00:11:53,088
If so, maybe she went to the wrong car

212
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:55,788
-and is walking around. -Pops.

213
00:11:55,788 --> 00:11:56,695
Where's Ai?

214
00:11:56,888 --> 00:11:58,697
She went that way, right?

215
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:00,699
Isn't she with Conan?

216
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:02,701
Wasn't she with you guys?

217
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,988
Well, she never came back after going to the bathroom!

218
00:12:05,988 --> 00:12:09,188
Then, maybe she fled to a car more in front?

219
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:10,709
I thought so too and looked for her

220
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:12,288
but couldn't find her.

221
00:12:12,288 --> 00:12:15,788
I tell you, what a brat.

222
00:12:16,888 --> 00:12:18,388
Right.

223
00:12:18,388 --> 00:12:20,719
I'm sure that she would go over to car number 8

224
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:21,988
where the fire started

225
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:24,288
because she'd think that this fire commotion

226
00:12:24,288 --> 00:12:26,725
is a trap that we set up to smoke her out.

227
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:29,288
I see! If she flees to the front car,

228
00:12:29,288 --> 00:12:31,088
you'd be waiting for her there

229
00:12:31,088 --> 00:12:33,288
so she decided to do otherwise, eh?

230
00:12:33,288 --> 00:12:35,488
You don't understand, do you?

231
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:39,888
Her friends will all evacuate to the front car, you know?

232
00:12:39,888 --> 00:12:43,088
If she, who's being sought after, goes there,

233
00:12:43,088 --> 00:12:45,488
she may get them all involved.

234
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:47,088
That's why she would deliberately

235
00:12:47,088 --> 00:12:49,288
go to the place where the fire started.

236
00:12:49,288 --> 00:12:53,888
Even if we were to be waiting there...

237
00:12:53,888 --> 00:12:55,588
She'd figure that it would be better for her

238
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:57,488
to be killed alone.

239
00:13:02,188 --> 00:13:03,488
The phone.

240
00:13:06,288 --> 00:13:08,488
Shinichi.

241
00:13:10,788 --> 00:13:12,771
Shinichi, what's up?

242
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:14,773
Mom, we're in trouble!

243
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:18,488
Haibara's nowhere in sight.

244
00:13:18,488 --> 00:13:20,779
Isn't she with you, Mom?

245
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:22,781
She's not here either!

246
00:13:22,988 --> 00:13:25,588
Maybe she evacuated to the front car?

247
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:27,088
It's easier for her to hide herself

248
00:13:27,088 --> 00:13:28,787
by mingling in the crowd besides.

249
00:13:28,988 --> 00:13:31,488
Okay, I'll check the front.

250
00:13:31,488 --> 00:13:33,688
Mom, you stick to the plan!

251
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,088
Okay!

252
00:13:36,188 --> 00:13:40,288
So, your son will be going to the front car.

253
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:46,588
And this is mail from my comrade.

254
00:13:46,588 --> 00:13:48,288
Oh, how disappointing.

255
00:13:48,288 --> 00:13:51,488
They seem to have found her in car number 8.

256
00:13:53,188 --> 00:13:56,088
It looks like our win.

257
00:13:57,288 --> 00:13:58,588
Bourbon.

258
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:02,488
This code name, doesn't it sound familiar?

259
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:05,688
I've met your family once.

260
00:14:05,688 --> 00:14:08,488
Yes. I know.

261
00:14:08,488 --> 00:14:10,829
You're a member of the Organization

262
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:14,188
that was a rival of Dai Moroboshi, my big sister's boyfriend.

263
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:15,688
According to what she said,

264
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,288
you both seemed to hate each other.

265
00:14:18,288 --> 00:14:23,888
Just as I thought, that guy was a dog of the FBI.

266
00:14:23,888 --> 00:14:25,388
After betraying the Organization,

267
00:14:25,388 --> 00:14:28,847
I found it hard to believe that he was gotten rid of.

268
00:14:29,088 --> 00:14:32,088
I disguised myself as him and stuck around

269
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:35,788
to watch the reactions of the people involved.

270
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:41,288
Thanks to that, I found out that the guy was really dead.

271
00:14:41,288 --> 00:14:43,988
Well, the one who helped me disguise myself

272
00:14:43,988 --> 00:14:48,088
was the man who disguised himself in my place, though.

273
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:51,188
The fact that you're here,

274
00:14:51,188 --> 00:14:55,388
goes to show that it was effective in causing you fear.

275
00:14:58,388 --> 00:15:02,088
Then, please raise your hands, and let's move on

276
00:15:02,088 --> 00:15:03,988
to the cargo car that is behind

277
00:15:03,988 --> 00:15:05,688
car number 8.

278
00:15:10,588 --> 00:15:14,488
It's only an hour before the Bell Tree Express arrives!

279
00:15:14,488 --> 00:15:17,788
All of you! Be on your guard, understand?

280
00:15:17,788 --> 00:15:19,588
How stupid can they get.

281
00:15:19,588 --> 00:15:21,588
Not knowing that as soon as the train arrives,

282
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,288
they'll all blow up due to the bomb

283
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:26,088
that is set up on the platform.

284
00:15:26,088 --> 00:15:28,907
More than that, Vermouth and Bourbon,

285
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:31,588
how are they going to escape from the train?

286
00:15:31,588 --> 00:15:32,688
They know about it, don't they,

287
00:15:32,688 --> 00:15:33,988
about the explosion?

288
00:15:33,988 --> 00:15:37,788
I wonder. That's none of my business.

289
00:15:37,788 --> 00:15:41,488
But, Vermouth asked me to give her a bomb

290
00:15:41,488 --> 00:15:42,921
if I had any extra.

291
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:44,088
What?

292
00:15:44,088 --> 00:15:46,288
I asked her what she was going to use it for,

293
00:15:46,288 --> 00:15:48,588
but she didn't tell me.

294
00:15:50,188 --> 00:15:52,931
That woman. Don't tell me she's...

295
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:56,935
Go on. Open that door and go inside.

296
00:16:00,488 --> 00:16:02,188
Don't worry.

297
00:16:02,188 --> 00:16:06,188
I plan to take you back to the Organization alive.

298
00:16:06,188 --> 00:16:06,945
I'm going to use this bomb

299
00:16:07,188 --> 00:16:09,388
to damage the connecting part

300
00:16:09,388 --> 00:16:11,588
and cut off only the cargo.

301
00:16:11,588 --> 00:16:12,951
As soon as it stops,

302
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:16,688
my comrades are supposed to come and get you.

303
00:16:16,688 --> 00:16:21,888
In the meantime, I'll need you to pass out for a while.

304
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:24,963
Well, everything will be fine.

305
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:27,788
I'll lay you down far from the door,

306
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:29,888
so you don't need to worry about being blown up.

307
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:32,588
I don't think so.

308
00:16:32,588 --> 00:16:36,688
It seems that this cargo car is full of bombs.

309
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:41,588
There seems to have been some mistake in your plans, huh?

310
00:16:41,588 --> 00:16:42,981
I see.

311
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:48,088
Vermouth is intent on killing her at all costs.

312
00:16:48,088 --> 00:16:51,888
I've got no choice. I'll have you come with me.

313
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:54,088
I'm sorry, but I don't think so.

314
00:16:55,788 --> 00:16:58,288
You're a bunch of trouble just as rumor has it.

315
00:16:58,288 --> 00:17:01,688
I guess I'll have to get a bit rough with you.

316
00:17:04,688 --> 00:17:06,188
Vermouth?

317
00:17:06,188 --> 00:17:08,188
Sorry, but I'm taking her with me.

318
00:17:12,188 --> 00:17:13,488
A hand grenade!

319
00:17:13,488 --> 00:17:16,388
Who is it? Who are you?

320
00:17:21,988 --> 00:17:23,588
Darn!

321
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:36,688
"Activation Device Launched, Comfirmed"

322
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:39,388
So, that's the end.

323
00:17:39,388 --> 00:17:41,688
No joke, this isn't happening, is it?

324
00:17:41,688 --> 00:17:44,688
Rest assured. Our members caused the explosion

325
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:48,088
after they confirmed that the connecting part was damaged.

326
00:17:48,088 --> 00:17:50,788
This car will not go off track.

327
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:51,788
Ai.

328
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:58,588
Ai!

329
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:05,088
You got rid of Sherry?

330
00:18:05,088 --> 00:18:07,588
Are you sure, Vermouth?

331
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:10,288
Yes. It seems that

332
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:12,688
Bourbon watched the cargo car blow up.

333
00:18:12,688 --> 00:18:15,788
Thanks to that, the train is stopped at a nearby station.

334
00:18:15,788 --> 00:18:17,075
It seems that all the passengers

335
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:19,077
will be interrogated, though.

336
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:20,488
How disappointing that

337
00:18:20,488 --> 00:18:23,988
I won't get to see you in Nagoya where you're waiting.

338
00:18:23,988 --> 00:18:26,088
That's why you wanted the bomb.

339
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:28,288
If an explosion occurs on board,

340
00:18:28,288 --> 00:18:30,488
there's no choice but to stop the train.

341
00:18:30,488 --> 00:18:32,088
Yes.

342
00:18:32,088 --> 00:18:36,188
It's enough that only Sherry is blown to pieces, isn't it?

343
00:18:36,188 --> 00:18:38,488
But, I was really surprised!

344
00:18:38,488 --> 00:18:41,588
To find that Haibara was in room B of car 7.

345
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,101
It seems to have been opened

346
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,103
because it was the room where the man died.

347
00:18:45,288 --> 00:18:46,288
It seems she felt faint

348
00:18:46,288 --> 00:18:49,688
after going to the restroom and rested there!

349
00:18:49,688 --> 00:18:53,588
Quiet. Because she seems to be tired and asleep.

350
00:18:53,588 --> 00:18:55,113
Okay.

351
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:57,115
I see.

352
00:18:57,288 --> 00:18:58,388
Thinking that if she were to flee anywhere,

353
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:02,588
it would be the only place, so Yukiko protected her.

354
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:05,688
Then, that call that her son made back then was...

355
00:19:05,688 --> 00:19:10,188
A fake call to keep me in that room.

356
00:19:10,188 --> 00:19:11,388
But, wait.

357
00:19:11,388 --> 00:19:13,131
If so, who is it?

358
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:16,688
The girl that exploded to death in front of Bourbon's eyes?

359
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:17,688
Don't tell me

360
00:19:17,688 --> 00:19:20,388
they really have somebody else cooperating with them.

361
00:20:46,388 --> 00:20:47,788
But, wait.

362
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,227
If so, who is it?

363
00:20:49,388 --> 00:20:52,988
The girl that exploded to death in front of Bourbon's eyes?

364
00:20:52,988 --> 00:20:53,988
Don't tell me

365
00:20:53,988 --> 00:20:57,235
they really have somebody else cooperating with them.

366
00:20:57,488 --> 00:21:01,688
I'm disappointed. So, Thief Kid can't come here anymore.

367
00:21:01,688 --> 00:21:03,241
This train won't be usable for a while

368
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:05,243
until their done investigating it so...

369
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:07,588
-Don't tell me that... -Sorry.

370
00:21:07,588 --> 00:21:10,788
It seems like things were looking really bad, huh.

371
00:21:10,788 --> 00:21:13,251
Don't tell me that the one helping them out is...

372
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:17,255
Nobody told me about this!

373
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:19,588
What's this all about? Who were those dangerous guys?

374
00:21:19,588 --> 00:21:22,288
If I didn't have my hand glider hidden in the cargo car,

375
00:21:22,288 --> 00:21:24,188
I would've been burnt black by now!

376
00:21:24,188 --> 00:21:27,265
Knowing you, I figured you'd have that ready.

377
00:21:27,488 --> 00:21:30,188
Well, I guess we both owe each other nothing anymore.

378
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:31,788
Of course not!

379
00:21:31,788 --> 00:21:33,588
Oh, that cell phone.

380
00:21:33,588 --> 00:21:36,188
Send it back to the Detective Agency, will you?

381
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,588
Oh, hey?

382
00:21:39,588 --> 00:21:41,888
That rotten brat.

383
00:21:41,888 --> 00:21:45,888
You grannies are Thief Kid and his henchmen, right?

384
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,388
What kind of joke is that supposed to be?

385
00:21:48,388 --> 00:21:50,488
The maid Ms. Sumitomo is Thief Kid,

386
00:21:50,488 --> 00:21:51,888
and you granny, is his henchman!

387
00:21:51,888 --> 00:21:55,788
It seems that the henchman cannot speak in Ms. Komino's voice.

388
00:21:55,788 --> 00:21:59,888
You moved your lips along as Kid acted as the ventriloquist

389
00:21:59,888 --> 00:22:03,788
and you tried to block the vision using the veil of your hat.

390
00:22:03,788 --> 00:22:08,088
I see. That's why you made me run along the corridor, eh?

391
00:22:08,088 --> 00:22:09,307
Yeah!

392
00:22:09,488 --> 00:22:11,309
I thought that if granny was left back alone,

393
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:13,788
she wouldn't be able to talk!

394
00:22:13,788 --> 00:22:15,588
Besides, all the people

395
00:22:15,588 --> 00:22:16,888
who were rescued from the fire in question,

396
00:22:16,888 --> 00:22:18,688
were afraid of the flames,

397
00:22:18,688 --> 00:22:22,988
but you didn't seem concerned and lighted your pipe.

398
00:22:22,988 --> 00:22:25,323
Well, show me gratitude!

399
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:26,988
Because I'm letting all of you guys

400
00:22:26,988 --> 00:22:28,788
who don't want to get involved

401
00:22:28,788 --> 00:22:30,288
and insist on having seen nothing go.

402
00:22:30,288 --> 00:22:34,488
And? What do you want me to do for you?

403
00:22:34,488 --> 00:22:36,288
I want you to disguise as her

404
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:40,288
and dodge their attack.

405
00:22:40,288 --> 00:22:42,188
As to the contents that you'll be talking with them about,

406
00:22:42,188 --> 00:22:45,988
she'll be using an earphone to tell you what to say.

407
00:22:45,988 --> 00:22:48,488
What do you mean we're even?

408
00:22:48,488 --> 00:22:52,388
You owe me one, famed detective.

409
00:22:55,788 --> 00:22:57,355
I see.

410
00:22:57,355 --> 00:23:02,688
So it was top-notch casting, Yukiko.

411
00:23:05,588 --> 00:23:07,365
Sera!

412
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:08,688
I'm glad.

413
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:12,688
I picked a cap up in the corridor, it's yours, isn't it?

414
00:23:12,688 --> 00:23:15,373
Oh, yep. Thank you.

415
00:23:16,588 --> 00:23:19,377
Why was it in the corridor?

416
00:23:19,377 --> 00:23:21,088
Everybody's over that way, so let's go!

417
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,988
Oh, okay.

418
00:23:25,688 --> 00:23:28,388
Will you show me the detailed file of

419
00:23:28,388 --> 00:23:30,188
just before Akai's death once again?

420
00:23:30,188 --> 00:23:31,389
Yes.

421
00:23:32,388 --> 00:23:33,988
It seems necessary

422
00:23:33,988 --> 00:23:37,395
to start investigating again from scratch.

423
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,652
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:23:48,652 --> 00:23:50,500
"Special Coach"

425
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,480
Sonoko, are you going through special intensive training?

426
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,300
You've got to be strong in love and tennis too.

427
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,413
Love's different.
