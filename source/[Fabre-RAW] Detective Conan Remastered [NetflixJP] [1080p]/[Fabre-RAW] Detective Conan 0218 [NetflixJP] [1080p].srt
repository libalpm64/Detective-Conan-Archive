1
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,430
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,230
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,130
The contents of the hat will finally be disclosed.

4
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,030
The mistake that Inspector Megure had made.

5
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,630
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,530
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,530
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,390
We accompanied Sonoko to the department store

9
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,390
because she wanted to go shopping.

10
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,390
However, Pops gets messed up in the decoy investigation

11
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,390
that Inspector Megure and the others have set up.

12
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,790
The inspector and the others were in the midst of

13
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,390
investigating a serial woman attacker case.

14
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,490
Just at that time, Ran finds the dead body of a woman

15
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,490
in the basement parking of the department store!

16
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,990
Inspector Megure and the other officers carry out their investigation,

17
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,990
but it seems that Inspector Megure is not acting his usual self.

18
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,390
Superintendent. Please let me stay and investigate a bit further!

19
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,290
I know I'm close to getting somewhere!

20
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,590
Besides, I have this feeling that the culprit is still somewhere nearby.

21
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,190
Well...

22
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,590
Inspector Megure.

23
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,590
Don't tell me that

24
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,290
you're not dragging the you know what case inside of you yet?

25
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,790
That case that you sealed up inside that hat of yours.

26
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:15,090
"Inspector Megure's Sealed Secret (Part 2)"

27
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,590
Mr. Mouri?

28
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,290
Please lend me the key to the car.

29
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,190
I guess it'll take a while longer

30
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,790
so I'm going to go put the things in the car

31
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,690
and then go to the restroom.

32
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,690
You'd better hurry because it's almost closing time.

33
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,690
Thank you.

34
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,090
Take this too, please.

35
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,690
Okay!

36
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,890
There it is!

37
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,190
This is it over here!

38
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,190
Gosh, what's with this car anyway?

39
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,890
What a way to park!

40
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,590
I can't even open the door!

41
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,090
Gosh!

42
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,990
There we go!

43
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,290
Inspector! It's been confirmed!

44
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,390
And?

45
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,790
That woman did get off the car after all

46
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,990
and go to the restroom in the park.

47
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,290
I see!

48
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,390
I don't understand it.

49
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,090
Why would the culprit want to go after

50
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,490
modern type girls who are riding cars?

51
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,890
Is he after something else or some other thing

52
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,190
that the four victims have in common?

53
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,290
"Closed for cleaning" -You've got to be kidding.

54
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,490
This one's being cleaned too.

55
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,290
Why don't they clean the restrooms after the department is closed?

56
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,590
The next closest restroom is on the eighth floor.

57
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,890
I guess I don't jive with restrooms.

58
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:58,390
Thank you very much for your patronage.

59
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,690
We will be closing in a few minutes.

60
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,990
Your continued patronage is most welcomed.

61
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,090
Oh, no. This can't be happening.

62
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,290
We're carrying the corpse out.

63
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,790
Hey! Watch her foot!

64
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,790
Sorry!

65
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:26,790
What? This shoe is too big for her.

66
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,790
Ran!

67
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,990
The thing that you were saying about something being strange.

68
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,390
Is it...

69
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,090
Right, that's it!

70
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,990
All tanned dark and dressed like that is absolutely outrageous.

71
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,490
If so, don't tell me that the culprit is...

72
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,390
Hey... don't turn the lights out on me.

73
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,790
I'm still here.

74
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,790
Hey, is anybody around?

75
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,890
"Haido Department Store"

76
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,990
What?

77
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,390
High soled boots?

78
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,190
Are you saying that the victim, Ms. Aizawa,

79
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,890
who was killed in this parking lot

80
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,690
was actually wearing high soled boots?

81
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:22,090
Yes! Girls who are tanned dark and wearing such flashy clothes

82
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,290
would never wear such regular low heeled slip on.

83
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,290
Right, Ran?

84
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,690
But why did the culprit go out of his way to change her shoes?

85
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,690
He didn't want anyone to notice.

86
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,490
That he was going around attacking

87
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,090
only drivers who are wearing high soled shoes!

88
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,890
What?

89
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:50,490
Come to think of it, the other three victims were also tanned dark

90
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,090
and wearing flashy clothes when they were attacked.

91
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,090
Which means that it is very likely that

92
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,890
they were also wearing high soled boots!

93
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,290
Yes, sir.

94
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,790
If it's related to high soled boots,

95
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,790
one of the causes that Ms. Aizawa got into that traffic accident a year ago

96
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:11,090
was that she was wearing high soled boots when she's driving.

97
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:15,090
Yumi told me that she couldn't hit the brakes fast enough because of it.

98
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,890
Is that true?

99
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:21,390
Yes! The late boys divorced parents

100
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,790
strongly insisted that it was the reason,

101
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,790
but it wasn't acknowledged after all.

102
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,790
His parents were divorced?

103
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,490
Yes, the reason was because his father used to get violent

104
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,590
under the influence of alcohol.

105
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,290
If I remember correctly the father's name was...

106
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,290
Sadakane, maybe?

107
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,290
Right... it was that sort of name!

108
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,290
Wait a minute!

109
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,890
The name of the security guard that we talked to a while ago

110
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,290
was also Sadakane.

111
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,290
Hey! Don't tell me the culprit is...

112
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,290
that security guard?

113
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,490
Takagi, go and check on the case a year ago!

114
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,290
-Yes, sir! -You guys go and look for security guard Sadakane!

115
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,190
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

116
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,590
How'd you ever figure it out?

117
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,790
It was really easy.

118
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,290
Because the culprit is after people

119
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,590
who are wearing high soled boots, right?

120
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,590
You can't tell if the person is wearing that kind of shoes from outside,

121
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:21,090
and the ones attacked were all customers of this department store.

122
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:24,090
So, it had to be somebody who could watch the customers

123
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,790
gets in and out of their cars in this parking lot.

124
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,090
The only person that I could think of as suspicious was the security guard!

125
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:33,790
But, the victims all testified that

126
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,990
the culprit was about 150 cm!

127
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:40,890
That security guard said he was 167 cm!

128
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,490
Come on! You are acting again!

129
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,490
All the women who were attacked

130
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,790
only said that the culprit was about their height.

131
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,590
So, if the women were wearing boots that were more than 10 cm high,

132
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,090
I know that you already realise that 10 cm more have to be added on

133
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,190
to the culprit's height!

134
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,990
I see, we measured their height

135
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,890
when they came to headquarters.

136
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,990
Since they were summoned for interrogation,

137
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,090
they probably avoided wearing high soled boots and flashy clothes.

138
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,290
But if the culprit wanted to avenge his son's death,

139
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,290
why didn't he go directly to her house

140
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,490
than ambush her in a place like this?

141
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,190
Did you forget, Mr. Mouri?

142
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,890
The victim is 20 years old, isn't she?

143
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,890
At the time of the accident, she was still under age, wasn't she?

144
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,190
The address of a juvenile is not publicised.

145
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:34,490
That's probably why he waited for her here,

146
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,290
where his son was run over.

147
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:41,290
He believe that the victim will come to this department store again.

148
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,890
I guess he got agitated because she didn't show up.

149
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,590
So, he decided to attack women drivers wearing high soled boots

150
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,590
just to vent out the anger he had within him.

151
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,490
Inspector! I've got what we need!

152
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,590
That security guard is the father of the boy

153
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,390
who died of the traffic accident a year ago, after all!

154
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,490
And, where is he now?

155
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,190
Well, his car is in this parking lot,

156
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,990
but he's nowhere in sight.

157
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,590
What's up, Ran?

158
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,290
Sonoko's not back yet.

159
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,790
She said that she was going to take her things to the car,

160
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,290
then go to the restroom, but...

161
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,190
Her things to the car?

162
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,490
Hey, if I'm not mistaken, Sonoko was wearing high soled boots.

163
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,690
Hello?

164
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,890
Ran?

165
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:40,290
Now? I'm still in the department store.

166
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,790
Listen to this, it's unacceptable.

167
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,790
I know I was taking my time in the restroom,

168
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,990
but the nerve of them to turn the lights off on me.

169
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,690
What is it? Is something the matter, Sonoko?

170
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,590
No, it's nothing.

171
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,290
I just thought I sensed something strange.

172
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,580
No!

173
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,280
She saw me...

174
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,880
She saw my face?

175
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,880
Hey, Sonoko? Sonoko?

176
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,480
He's made a mistake!

177
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,580
He's mistaken Sonoko for a driver wearing high soled boots

178
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,880
because she had the keys to the car

179
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,180
and was putting her things in the car!

180
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,180
What?

181
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,180
Where did she say she is now?

182
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,180
She said she is in the department store.

183
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,380
Was the phone cut off?

184
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,180
No, it's still connected

185
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,180
but I hear a computer-like voice in the distance.

186
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,880
Computer-like voice?

187
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,480
Please choose the frame of your choice.

188
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,880
Push the button after you take a pose!

189
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,780
It's a picture taking machine!

190
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,180
Is there a picture taking machine in this department store?

191
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,980
Yes, there is!

192
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,180
I'm sure there were two machines

193
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,080
by the stairs of the restaurant arcade on the 10th floor.

194
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,180
I see!

195
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,880
Even though the lower floors are closed,

196
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,080
the restaurants close late.

197
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,980
So, Sonoko must've tried to get down using the elevator there.

198
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,780
Okay! Takagi, you go get the lights turned on!

199
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,080
Megure and Sato,

200
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,880
go around to the top with the elevator,

201
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,680
and the others go from below to the top and take custody of the girl,

202
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,480
as well as nab the suspect!

203
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,480
Yes, sir...

204
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,880
Hey! Out of the way! Move!

205
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,080
Inspector Megure is really into this case.

206
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,380
They're very similar.

207
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:06,180
This case is very similar to the first case that he handled.

208
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,680
Where is your daughter and the boy wearing glasses?

209
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,680
What?

210
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,480
There it is!

211
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,780
This is hers!

212
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,580
It's unmistakably Sonoko's cell phone!

213
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,780
The customers at the restaurant arcade don't seem to have seen Sonoko,

214
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,580
so she must've run into the department store.

215
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,580
Hey, Takagi! Can't you get the lights on yet?

216
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,380
You guys are devils!

217
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,380
Moreover,

218
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:20,480
you're devils pretending to be cute girls while committing crime.

219
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,480
Devils don't deserve to live!

220
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
What's happening?

221
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,580
-A black out? -Darn! Why at a time like this?

222
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,480
Sonoko.

223
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,880
Sonoko, where are you?

224
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,080
Sonoko!

225
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,080
Quiet!

226
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,580
It's the sound of a lot of something falling to the ground!

227
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,580
Sand, grains...

228
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,380
No, something bigger.

229
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,880
I think it's the sound of the pebbles

230
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,880
that are used on the floor of aquariums.

231
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,880
The pet shop is on the fourth floor.

232
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,680
She's on the fourth floor, then!

233
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,180
Let's hurry!

234
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,680
I'm sorry.

235
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,580
All I wanted to do was teach you a lesson.

236
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,680
But, you saw me, didn't you?

237
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,080
You saw my face.

238
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,180
Sonoko...

239
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,380
It's strange. Nobody's in the pet shop!

240
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,180
Sonoko!

241
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,380
It's strange, nothing is broken, nor is anything on the floor!

242
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,780
Don't tell me that the sound we just heard was...

243
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,480
You saw my face, didn't you?

244
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,780
Inspector.

245
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,280
How?

246
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,180
Do you feel good?

247
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:31,080
I'm asking you if you feel good about hurting people.

248
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,780
You may be thinking that you are flinging that metal bat of justice

249
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,880
upon young drivers with bad manners,

250
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,280
but unfortunately, she is just a high school girl

251
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,180
who was putting her things in the car.

252
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,780
What you're doing is not for justice

253
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,580
or for the sake of your late son.

254
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,380
It's just an act of unjustified resentment based on misunderstanding!

255
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,180
You took the lives of people who had nothing to do with the case

256
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,480
just for your own satisfaction,

257
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,980
in order to amuse yourself and distract yourself from your grief!

258
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,180
Don't you see what you're doing?

259
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:20,080
All I wanted was for that woman to apologise.

260
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,380
For her to wear normal shoes

261
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,680
and apologise to my son up in heaven.

262
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,480
I just wanted her to apologise.

263
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,480
That's really how I felt in the beginning.

264
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,080
It's true.

265
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,480
Sonoko!

266
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,480
Ran...

267
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,380
Are you all right? You're not hurt, are you?

268
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,580
No! I was so scared!

269
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,580
Inspector! How you figured out where she was?

270
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,080
Well...

271
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,180
This lead me here.

272
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,180
This "go" stone.

273
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,680
Inspector! Are you all right?

274
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,880
No need for worry.

275
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,280
It's just that the old wound opened up again.

276
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,280
The old wound that I was supposed to have left back way in the past.

277
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,480
"Midoridai Police Hospital" -What?

278
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,380
An old wound that he got from a case in the past?

279
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,180
Yes, Megure wears the hat

280
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,180
in order to hide the old wound that he got in the past.

281
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:07,880
But, isn't a wound equivalent to a medal of award for an officer?

282
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,080
Why should he hide it?

283
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,080
It's been more than 20 years ago.

284
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,080
Yes, it was back then

285
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,580
when Megure had just become a police detective.

286
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,280
I take it you all know about

287
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,580
the case of high school girls being run over, the hit-and-run case.

288
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,080
Yes!

289
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,880
The motive of the criminal was the grudge that he held towards

290
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,080
the delinquent high school girls who blackmailed him for money.

291
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,180
What the criminal did was catch the girls alone

292
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:40,180
and run them over with his car. Totally outrageous.

293
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,880
Back then, the fad among delinquent high school girls

294
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,180
were skirts worn long below their knees.

295
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,180
He went and ran over every such girl he saw.

296
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,080
At first, he just bumped into them and fled,

297
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,880
but his actions eventually escalated,

298
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,580
and a victim ended up being killed.

299
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,880
Therefore, we warned the high school girls in the vicinity

300
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,880
not to wear skirts like those when going out.

301
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,180
No more cases were reported after that.

302
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,180
However, one day, a high school girl

303
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,880
came up saying that she would like to act as decoy,

304
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,780
so that she could avenge the death of her friend.

305
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,580
Of course we turned her offer down.

306
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,180
But, we had no way of stopping the girl

307
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,880
who had her doubts about the police either.

308
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,580
Therefore, we had Megure watch over her.

309
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:49,180
The criminal tried to run over her as well as Megure.

310
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,180
Fortunately, Inspector Megure remembered the license plate number.

311
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,480
Although the criminal was caught, but he paid a large price in return.

312
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,880
Although Megure got away with a wound on his head,

313
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,080
the girl slammed her body and head hard against the pavement,

314
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,080
and by the time we got to the scene,

315
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,080
she was covered with blood and totally wasted.

316
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,380
Then, the reason why the inspector doesn't take off his hat is...

317
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,080
Yes, that's right.

318
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,080
It's because most surely anybody would ask him

319
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,880
how he got the large wound on his head if they saw it.

320
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,280
And, each time, he'd have to recall the incident back then.

321
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,180
That's why Megure sealed off the wound with his hat.

322
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,580
That old wound packed with bad memories.

323
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,980
That's why the inspector was so much against the decoy idea.

324
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,480
He doesn't want to let the decoy to be sacrificed again.

325
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,780
Hey...

326
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:53,480
Although the girl was badly hurt, but she didn't die.

327
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,280
After all, she's Megure's...

328
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,480
Oh, Superintendent Matsumoto.

329
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,480
You've come to visit too.

330
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,480
"Megure's Wife" -Officer Takagi and Shiratori just left.

331
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,480
So they've also come!

332
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,480
Yes, they've all come between working hours.

333
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,780
She has a wound on her forehead?

334
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,080
Don't tell me that...

335
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,880
Hey, Midori. Will you peel an apple for me?

336
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,480
Gosh, he is so spoiled regardless of his age.

337
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,180
I guess I'll go blast him one so that he shapes up

338
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,080
and gets back to work as soon as possible.

339
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,480
Yes, by all means.

340
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,580
Come to think of it, I've heard that Inspector Megure's wife

341
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,880
used to be a delinquent before.

342
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,780
Maybe the reason he never takes off his hat is because...

343
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:50,780
He doesn't want to be teased about his first encounter with his wife.

344
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,080
Hey! What's taking you so long?

345
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,440
Next Conan's Hint:

346
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,980
"10 yen coin
