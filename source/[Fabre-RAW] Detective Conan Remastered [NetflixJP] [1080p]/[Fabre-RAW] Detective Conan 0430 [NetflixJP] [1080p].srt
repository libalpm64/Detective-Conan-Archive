1
00:00:02,178 --> 00:00:03,878
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:05,778
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:05,778 --> 00:00:07,278
The locked door mystery of a car

4
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:08,678
that is sealed tightly with masking tape from the inside,

5
00:00:08,678 --> 00:00:10,378
won't even let a tangled love affair through.

6
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:11,878
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:13,678
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,678 --> 00:00:15,478
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,975
After the battle with the Black Organization,

10
00:01:59,975 --> 00:02:02,275
we are leading a peaceful everyday life.

11
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,875
Then, a new student who looks just like Kir

12
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,575
of the Black Organization comes to Ran's class.

13
00:02:08,575 --> 00:02:10,475
His name is Eisuke Hondo.

14
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:14,075
Well, he turns out to be a great fan of Pops

15
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:15,875
and an ordinary high school klutz.

16
00:02:17,175 --> 00:02:20,975
Just then, a client comes in asking Pops to look for a runaway girl.

17
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,375
And?

18
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:27,775
Did you two really meet on this freezing mountain?

19
00:02:27,775 --> 00:02:29,275
On the other side of that tree!

20
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:30,675
That's my car!

21
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:32,875
Ami? Ami?

22
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:37,075
The door is sealed tight from the inside of the car with masking tape.

23
00:02:37,075 --> 00:02:39,975
There is a portable charcoal stove by the passenger's seat

24
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:42,375
with burned remains of solid fuel.

25
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:46,875
In other words, this is carbon monoxide poisoning,

26
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,275
that was carried out by burning solid fuel in a sealed car.

27
00:02:49,275 --> 00:02:52,475
There's no doubt that she committed suicide.

28
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:53,475
No.

29
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:56,775
This is cleverly schemed homicide that was set up to look as suicide.

30
00:02:56,775 --> 00:02:59,675
Moreover, the culprit is probably...

31
00:02:59,675 --> 00:03:00,675
that man.

32
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:07,775
"The Point of No Return (Part 2)"

33
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,475
So it's suicide.

34
00:03:10,475 --> 00:03:13,075
I guess it can't be helped then.

35
00:03:13,075 --> 00:03:16,675
We will have you come in for interrogation at a later date,

36
00:03:16,675 --> 00:03:17,675
so we'll call it a...

37
00:03:19,975 --> 00:03:22,875
Hey, are you all right?

38
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:26,075
Yeah, I just tripped over uneven ground.

39
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:32,275
What is this hollow part?

40
00:03:35,575 --> 00:03:37,575
From the size of it,

41
00:03:37,575 --> 00:03:40,075
looks like a car was parked here.

42
00:03:40,075 --> 00:03:42,775
Strange. I wonder who parked here?

43
00:03:42,775 --> 00:03:44,675
It looks to be just about the size the rental car

44
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:47,475
of the man with the mustache that we drove here in.

45
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:53,275
By the way, when did you borrow the rental car?

46
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,275
From last night.

47
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:57,775
After the fight last night,

48
00:03:57,775 --> 00:04:01,575
she said she needed to use the car very badly today,

49
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,675
so I rushed to rent a car

50
00:04:03,675 --> 00:04:06,675
because I needed to use the car today, too.

51
00:04:06,675 --> 00:04:08,775
I had no idea that she was going to use the car

52
00:04:08,775 --> 00:04:10,775
for something like this though.

53
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:14,075
You must be a super scatterbrain, sir.

54
00:04:14,075 --> 00:04:16,975
If you knew that she was going to take the car,

55
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:20,175
why did you leave your important company papers inside?

56
00:04:22,775 --> 00:04:26,375
I was thinking of taking it out in the morning.

57
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,675
What is it? The important papers of the company?

58
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:33,475
Some documents that he has to submit to the company tomorrow.

59
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:35,475
He hired me to find his girlfriend who disappeared

60
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:39,275
because he needed those papers back.

61
00:04:39,275 --> 00:04:41,475
But did you find them?

62
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:44,275
No. I was more concerned about her, so...

63
00:04:44,275 --> 00:04:45,775
Now that you mentioned it, the documents...

64
00:04:48,175 --> 00:04:51,675
Excuse me, did you find any documents in the car?

65
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:55,675
Yeah, there was an envelope in the backseat of the car.

66
00:04:55,675 --> 00:04:58,475
Yes. That's it, that's it.

67
00:04:58,475 --> 00:05:01,775
So you found it. I'm glad.

68
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:02,875
Come to think of it,

69
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:07,475
a bag that is thought to be the woman's was also in the car.

70
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:09,075
This was in her bag, too.

71
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:12,975
This is a cigarette lighter.

72
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:18,775
Why would something like that be in her bag?

73
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:20,075
Who knows?

74
00:05:20,075 --> 00:05:23,375
We can tell that she put it in her bag today,

75
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:26,075
because there was a burnt trace of the cigarette lighter

76
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,975
on the novel that went on sale today inside her bag, too.

77
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:30,475
But for some reason,

78
00:05:30,475 --> 00:05:33,975
there are no fingerprints whatsoever on that novel.

79
00:05:35,075 --> 00:05:37,675
This is getting weirder by the minute.

80
00:05:37,675 --> 00:05:39,675
She hated cigarettes

81
00:05:39,675 --> 00:05:42,675
and used to always hide it to keep me, who is a heavy smoker

82
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,475
from smoking in the car.

83
00:05:44,475 --> 00:05:46,875
Maybe she just did it out of habit.

84
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,575
You're a heavy smoker?

85
00:05:49,575 --> 00:05:51,775
Yes.

86
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:54,975
May I go take a puff in the rented car?

87
00:05:54,975 --> 00:05:58,375
I was refraining from smoking because of the circumstances.

88
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,475
Yeah.

89
00:06:01,475 --> 00:06:02,475
Cigarettes.

90
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,375
Wait a second.

91
00:06:09,275 --> 00:06:10,275
Maybe...

92
00:06:12,075 --> 00:06:13,075
Hey!

93
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,975
Just as I thought.

94
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:27,275
The killer is Mr. Misumi. There's no doubt about it.

95
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:29,475
Hey.

96
00:06:29,475 --> 00:06:31,775
All I need to figure out now is the trick.

97
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,175
It hurts...

98
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:39,175
Are you all right, Eisuke?

99
00:06:39,175 --> 00:06:40,375
See.

100
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,975
The first one to slip and fall at times like this is me.

101
00:06:43,975 --> 00:06:46,575
Hey, your finger is bleeding!

102
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:51,875
It's probably from a shard that came from the front glass.

103
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:55,175
Wait. I have a bandage.

104
00:06:55,175 --> 00:06:56,275
Show me your finger.

105
00:06:58,575 --> 00:06:59,575
Okay.

106
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:14,675
It'll heal right away if you put spit on it!

107
00:07:14,675 --> 00:07:17,375
But I think bandage should be used, just in case.

108
00:07:19,175 --> 00:07:20,575
Put it on yourself.

109
00:07:25,075 --> 00:07:28,375
Bandage is really something, isn't it?

110
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,575
Why?

111
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:34,275
It helps the wound that is cut open close up in an instant.

112
00:07:34,275 --> 00:07:37,675
Look. It's like there was never a wound to begin with.

113
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:42,275
Wait a second.

114
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:43,875
Don't tell me that the masking tape...

115
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:47,175
Forensic officer.

116
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,575
Not you again.

117
00:07:48,575 --> 00:07:50,775
I seemed to have forgotten something in the car

118
00:07:50,775 --> 00:07:53,275
when I went in a while ago.

119
00:07:53,275 --> 00:07:54,675
May I go get it?

120
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:55,775
Hey, kid!

121
00:08:00,275 --> 00:08:02,075
I see.

122
00:08:02,075 --> 00:08:04,075
So that's the story.

123
00:08:06,175 --> 00:08:08,275
Suicide.

124
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:10,075
It was suicide.

125
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:11,875
But...

126
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,475
The car that Ami was in

127
00:08:14,475 --> 00:08:18,075
was sealed tightly from the inside with masking tape.

128
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:19,275
And on the floor of the passenger's seat

129
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:23,475
were the burnt remains of solid fuel inside a portable charcoal stove.

130
00:08:23,475 --> 00:08:26,075
That's why a deduction show by the Sleeping Kogoro

131
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:28,075
is not necessary in this case!

132
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:30,275
I guess so.

133
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:31,975
Too bad.

134
00:08:34,175 --> 00:08:35,975
What do you mean?

135
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:39,075
You should be glad that this wasn't a homicide.

136
00:08:39,075 --> 00:08:41,675
But everyone at the station is looking forward

137
00:08:41,675 --> 00:08:44,275
to watch the video of the Sleeping Kogoro!

138
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:46,475
Can't anything be done about it?

139
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:48,275
What do you mean by that?

140
00:08:48,275 --> 00:08:50,475
Pops!

141
00:08:50,475 --> 00:08:51,475
What is it?

142
00:08:51,475 --> 00:08:53,775
I noticed something,

143
00:08:53,775 --> 00:08:54,975
so will you come with me for a second?

144
00:08:56,775 --> 00:08:57,775
What is it?

145
00:08:59,075 --> 00:09:01,775
Pops! The door of this car.

146
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,975
Don't you think it's strange?

147
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:05,275
Not really.

148
00:09:05,275 --> 00:09:08,675
The masking tape is cut, that's all.

149
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:23,575
Is something the matter?

150
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:28,975
That all absorbing attitude as if to despise everyone is indeed

151
00:09:28,975 --> 00:09:30,375
the Sleeping Kogoro!

152
00:09:32,075 --> 00:09:34,675
"As if to despise everyone" is a needless remark.

153
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:37,275
But you're posing like that means...

154
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:38,875
You are...

155
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:39,975
Yeah.

156
00:09:39,975 --> 00:09:43,975
I'm going to show you the deduction of the Sleeping Kogoro right now.

157
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,275
-All right! -All right!

158
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:48,375
But before that,

159
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:51,275
bring the most important person involved in this case,

160
00:09:51,275 --> 00:09:55,275
Misumi, the boyfriend of the victim here.

161
00:10:15,302 --> 00:10:18,602
What? Detective Mouri's deduction show?

162
00:10:18,602 --> 00:10:19,802
Ridiculous.

163
00:10:19,802 --> 00:10:22,202
Ami committed suicide, didn't she?

164
00:10:22,202 --> 00:10:24,402
What on earth is he going to deduce?

165
00:10:24,402 --> 00:10:26,402
I agree with you.

166
00:10:26,402 --> 00:10:29,102
I've got a whole lot to deduce.

167
00:10:29,102 --> 00:10:32,402
After all, this is a homicide made to look like a suicide.

168
00:10:32,402 --> 00:10:33,902
Homicide?

169
00:10:33,902 --> 00:10:35,402
What?

170
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:38,102
Yeah. Moreover, the killer

171
00:10:38,102 --> 00:10:40,902
is the one who cracked the glass and went into the car to rescue Ami.

172
00:10:40,902 --> 00:10:44,002
He cut the masking tape off and opened the car up.

173
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:45,802
Mr. Atsushi Misumi,

174
00:10:45,802 --> 00:10:47,402
I'm talking about you!

175
00:10:49,702 --> 00:10:51,602
Is that so?

176
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:53,202
What an unexpected deduction!

177
00:10:54,802 --> 00:10:58,202
Look. That's the Sleeping Kogoro.

178
00:10:58,202 --> 00:11:00,402
He's just looking down and talking

179
00:11:00,402 --> 00:11:02,802
and there's no God descended on him, is there?

180
00:11:04,902 --> 00:11:07,302
Yes, but...

181
00:11:07,302 --> 00:11:09,202
Doesn't it bother you?

182
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,602
What?

183
00:11:10,602 --> 00:11:12,202
Next to Mr. Mouri...

184
00:11:12,202 --> 00:11:16,202
That boy who is behind the car.

185
00:11:16,202 --> 00:11:18,302
Oh, you mean Conan?

186
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,302
He often helps dad out during his deduction,

187
00:11:21,302 --> 00:11:22,902
so he's probably standing by.

188
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:28,802
Please stop kidding, Mr. Mouri.

189
00:11:28,802 --> 00:11:33,402
But I'm the very one who asked you to look for her, you know?

190
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:35,502
Then why would I...

191
00:11:35,502 --> 00:11:38,802
Because you had your reasons for needing to do so.

192
00:11:38,802 --> 00:11:43,602
You had to in order to make it look like she sealed herself in the car.

193
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,802
To make it look like?

194
00:11:45,802 --> 00:11:47,402
With all due respect, Mr. Mouri,

195
00:11:47,402 --> 00:11:50,502
I think that this car was sealed from the inside.

196
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,002
Even the forensic officers said that the masking tape

197
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:56,202
was sealed on tightly that it was difficult to tear them off.

198
00:11:56,202 --> 00:11:57,902
That's definitely true.

199
00:11:57,902 --> 00:12:00,702
But that only goes for the masking tape on the driver's seat side.

200
00:12:00,702 --> 00:12:03,802
Nobody even thought that a slit had been made to begin with

201
00:12:03,802 --> 00:12:07,502
in the masking tape on the passenger's seat side.

202
00:12:07,502 --> 00:12:09,102
What the...

203
00:12:09,102 --> 00:12:12,202
But you were watching him cut the masking tape of the door

204
00:12:12,202 --> 00:12:16,002
with a cutter knife, weren't you?

205
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,502
Yeah, I was.

206
00:12:18,502 --> 00:12:22,802
I saw him undo the tape on the door by pressing on it,

207
00:12:22,802 --> 00:12:27,002
and very skilfully cut the tape by pressing down on the tape.

208
00:12:29,602 --> 00:12:31,602
Tape that was very lightly sealed?

209
00:12:31,602 --> 00:12:35,602
First, Mr. Misumi brings his girlfriend here with his car.

210
00:12:35,602 --> 00:12:37,502
On his way here, he put her to sleep

211
00:12:37,502 --> 00:12:40,302
with the sleeping drug that was inserted in the canned coffee.

212
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:44,302
Then, he carried her up and made her sit on the driver's seat

213
00:12:44,302 --> 00:12:48,802
and seals all the doors of the car with masking tape from the inside.

214
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:52,402
Then he cuts the masking tape on the passenger's seat side

215
00:12:52,402 --> 00:12:55,702
following the line that joins the body of the car and the door.

216
00:12:55,702 --> 00:12:58,902
He opens the door and seals vertically cut masking tape

217
00:12:58,902 --> 00:13:03,802
over the masking tape on the body of the car.

218
00:13:03,802 --> 00:13:07,202
He then burns solid fuel in the portable charcoal stove

219
00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:08,802
that is placed under the passenger's seat,

220
00:13:08,802 --> 00:13:11,802
goes out and closes the door to complete his task.

221
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:17,202
He finally goes to the car that he had brought here beforehand

222
00:13:17,202 --> 00:13:18,902
and leaves here for a while.

223
00:13:18,902 --> 00:13:21,602
He brings someone here so that they can see

224
00:13:21,602 --> 00:13:27,702
that the masking tape on the driver's seat side is sealed on tightly.

225
00:13:27,702 --> 00:13:30,302
After that, he cracks the windshield and goes into the car

226
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:32,402
to cut the lightly sealed masking tape

227
00:13:32,402 --> 00:13:35,302
by pressing it along with his hand.

228
00:13:35,302 --> 00:13:39,202
The locked room homicide is completed.

229
00:13:39,202 --> 00:13:40,802
I see!

230
00:13:40,802 --> 00:13:43,602
If you want to save someone on the driver's seat side,

231
00:13:43,602 --> 00:13:47,202
it's most natural to try and open the door on the driver's seat side.

232
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,602
Even from the driver's side,

233
00:13:48,602 --> 00:13:53,202
you could see that there was tape on each side of the door.

234
00:13:53,202 --> 00:13:55,702
If the masking tape is cut by pressing down on it,

235
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,302
it will adhere

236
00:13:57,302 --> 00:13:58,802
and even if it is checked later,

237
00:13:58,802 --> 00:14:02,302
it would go unnoticed that only the tape there was sealed on lightly.

238
00:14:02,302 --> 00:14:04,502
Yeah.

239
00:14:04,502 --> 00:14:08,402
Please take a look at the cut part of the masking tape

240
00:14:08,402 --> 00:14:09,902
that is sealed onto the passenger's seat side.

241
00:14:09,902 --> 00:14:11,102
The cut part?

242
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,802
The cut part of the masking tape sealed horizontally and vertically

243
00:14:14,802 --> 00:14:16,402
is out of place, isn't it?

244
00:14:16,402 --> 00:14:19,202
After cutting the horizontally sealed masking tape once,

245
00:14:19,202 --> 00:14:20,802
another masking tape was vertically sealed on over it.

246
00:14:20,802 --> 00:14:23,302
That's evidence that he cut it twice.

247
00:14:23,302 --> 00:14:25,602
That's true.

248
00:14:25,602 --> 00:14:28,602
Which means that the driver's seat was pulled back

249
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:31,402
and the crease in the top of her clothes were...

250
00:14:31,402 --> 00:14:35,902
Yeah, it proves that Mr. Misumi is the one who drove here

251
00:14:35,902 --> 00:14:39,802
and moved her over to the driver's seat.

252
00:14:39,802 --> 00:14:41,902
Please wait a minute.

253
00:14:41,902 --> 00:14:43,702
All I was trying to do

254
00:14:43,702 --> 00:14:47,302
was get my girlfriend out of the car as soon as possible.

255
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:51,702
How offending that my actions would be interpreted that way.

256
00:14:51,702 --> 00:14:54,002
You don't even have proof that I did it either.

257
00:14:54,002 --> 00:14:55,702
Proof?

258
00:14:55,702 --> 00:14:58,102
There is a very concrete proof.

259
00:14:58,102 --> 00:15:00,602
The ashtray inside the car.

260
00:15:00,602 --> 00:15:01,902
Huh?

261
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:07,202
Remember that cigarette lighter in her bag?

262
00:15:07,202 --> 00:15:12,602
It was not only to keep Mr. Misumi from smoking inside this car,

263
00:15:12,602 --> 00:15:18,002
but also to keep something else from his view until she got off the car.

264
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:21,002
That is, the message of farewell

265
00:15:21,002 --> 00:15:22,702
that she hid in the ashtray.

266
00:15:24,402 --> 00:15:25,702
Let's see.

267
00:15:25,702 --> 00:15:28,402
"I guess you want to take me to the place where we first met

268
00:15:28,402 --> 00:15:31,602
to get back how we felt for each other before,

269
00:15:31,602 --> 00:15:34,302
but I've changed.

270
00:15:34,302 --> 00:15:35,702
I'm sorry.

271
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:37,402
Ami."

272
00:15:37,402 --> 00:15:40,702
Which means that she's the one who changed.

273
00:15:40,702 --> 00:15:45,602
And you're the one who brought her to the place you both first met.

274
00:15:45,602 --> 00:15:48,702
If the one who wrote this is the victim,

275
00:15:48,702 --> 00:15:50,202
this would serve as proof.

276
00:15:50,202 --> 00:15:53,302
It's a trap! This is a trap that Ami set up!

277
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:56,802
She made it look like I killed her and committed suicide!

278
00:15:56,802 --> 00:15:58,302
Even for the slit in the masking tape,

279
00:15:58,302 --> 00:16:01,002
if she assumed that I would use the cutter knife,

280
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,702
she could've put it into the dashboard beforehand.

281
00:16:03,702 --> 00:16:07,302
And as for that message, she could've written it to frame me.

282
00:16:07,302 --> 00:16:09,902
The message is not proof.

283
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:13,802
The point is the book cover with the message written on it.

284
00:16:15,202 --> 00:16:16,802
As you can see,

285
00:16:16,802 --> 00:16:20,102
that is a paper cover that the bookshop covers the book with.

286
00:16:20,102 --> 00:16:22,402
It was probably from the book that was released today

287
00:16:22,402 --> 00:16:26,302
that was found inside her bag.

288
00:16:26,302 --> 00:16:32,102
No fingerprints were found on that book because you wiped them off.

289
00:16:32,102 --> 00:16:33,702
You did this because your fingerprints

290
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:37,702
would be on it after giving it to her.

291
00:16:39,602 --> 00:16:44,402
However, it seems you absentmindedly forgot and didn't wipe everything off.

292
00:16:44,402 --> 00:16:49,802
That is, the fingerprints on the book cover that she wrote the message on

293
00:16:49,802 --> 00:16:52,902
and secretly hid in the ashtray.

294
00:16:52,902 --> 00:16:55,402
Now, I'd like to ask you.

295
00:16:55,402 --> 00:16:57,002
If you woke up this morning

296
00:16:57,002 --> 00:16:59,102
and found that she had left along with the car,

297
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,902
how can there be your fingerprints

298
00:17:00,902 --> 00:17:05,202
on the book cover that was released today?

299
00:17:05,202 --> 00:17:10,902
But you can't tell if the cover came from that book that was in her bag.

300
00:17:10,902 --> 00:17:15,702
Books are all different sizes, even if they belong to the same series.

301
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:20,202
A cover that matches the exact size is very rare.

302
00:17:20,202 --> 00:17:21,702
If you want, shall we go together to the book store,

303
00:17:21,702 --> 00:17:24,702
which address is written on the cover?

304
00:17:24,702 --> 00:17:27,902
I'm sure they'll testify

305
00:17:27,902 --> 00:17:30,002
that the man who bought the book this morning had bloodshot eyes,

306
00:17:30,002 --> 00:17:32,902
haunted by the crime he was planning to commit.

307
00:17:32,902 --> 00:17:35,002
In other words, you.

308
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,102
Bloodshot eyes?

309
00:17:44,102 --> 00:17:48,202
Wrong, Mr. Detective.

310
00:17:48,202 --> 00:17:51,802
I must've looked sad and wretched.

311
00:17:51,802 --> 00:17:56,602
Because I figured that it was the last wish from the woman I loved.

312
00:17:56,602 --> 00:18:00,902
So you did get the novel that she asked you for.

313
00:18:00,902 --> 00:18:02,102
Yes.

314
00:18:02,102 --> 00:18:07,002
Just as you expect, my fingerprints are on the book cover.

315
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:10,102
I've always done as she asked.

316
00:18:10,102 --> 00:18:15,802
Yes, I granted her every wish just as she wanted me to.

317
00:18:15,802 --> 00:18:17,702
If she told me she wanted to go on a trip,

318
00:18:17,702 --> 00:18:19,802
I would take time off from work and take her.

319
00:18:19,802 --> 00:18:22,202
If she told me she wanted to see a popular concert,

320
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:24,902
I would stand in line all night and get her a premier ticket.

321
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:28,202
The same with this car.

322
00:18:28,202 --> 00:18:30,302
She said that she wanted to drive it,

323
00:18:30,302 --> 00:18:33,102
so I bought it despite having to borrow money.

324
00:18:33,102 --> 00:18:38,002
Yes. I felt as if I were her prince.

325
00:18:38,002 --> 00:18:42,002
But I finally realized that I had made a mistake.

326
00:18:42,002 --> 00:18:44,902
She didn't consider me her prince.

327
00:18:44,902 --> 00:18:47,202
I was no more than a servant to her.

328
00:18:47,202 --> 00:18:49,702
A servant?

329
00:18:49,702 --> 00:18:52,302
I found a cigarette in the car.

330
00:18:52,302 --> 00:18:54,802
It was a brand that I don't use.

331
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:58,502
She never let me smoke one cigarette when I rode with her.

332
00:18:58,502 --> 00:19:00,702
Don't tell me that she was cheating on you?

333
00:19:00,702 --> 00:19:02,102
Yes.

334
00:19:02,102 --> 00:19:03,402
When I pressed her for an answer,

335
00:19:03,402 --> 00:19:08,702
she confessed that she used to often go driving with that guy in this car.

336
00:19:08,702 --> 00:19:12,002
She even laughed about it!

337
00:19:12,002 --> 00:19:15,202
I felt really stupid

338
00:19:15,202 --> 00:19:18,102
thinking that I kept paying back the loan for the car

339
00:19:18,102 --> 00:19:20,602
for a guy I didn't even know.

340
00:19:20,602 --> 00:19:23,902
Is that why you committed the crime?

341
00:19:23,902 --> 00:19:25,702
Yes.

342
00:19:25,702 --> 00:19:27,102
But please believe me!

343
00:19:27,102 --> 00:19:30,802
Officer, I really loved her!

344
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:34,102
I didn't come here just to commit the crime!

345
00:19:34,102 --> 00:19:36,702
It was for her as well.

346
00:19:36,702 --> 00:19:38,502
I was full of regret.

347
00:19:38,502 --> 00:19:42,302
I wished that she were still alive.

348
00:19:42,302 --> 00:19:45,402
That's why I cracked the windshield with the metal bat with all my might.

349
00:19:45,402 --> 00:19:47,002
Okay, that's enough.

350
00:19:50,702 --> 00:19:54,602
I don't know what went on between you and her,

351
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:59,102
but one thing for sure is that, the "love" between you both was gone.

352
00:19:59,102 --> 00:20:00,202
What?

353
00:20:00,202 --> 00:20:03,902
If you really wanted to save her,

354
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,302
you would've intuitively carefully cracked the rear window

355
00:20:05,302 --> 00:20:10,702
or the side window on the passenger's seat side from behind.

356
00:20:10,702 --> 00:20:15,502
But you broke through the front window,

357
00:20:15,502 --> 00:20:19,502
because you knew that the glass shards would cut her.

358
00:20:20,502 --> 00:20:25,602
You already knew that she was dead.

359
00:20:25,602 --> 00:20:28,102
You wanted to crush everything, didn't you?

360
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:32,102
The memories together with her along with this car.

361
00:22:05,402 --> 00:22:08,302
Well, just as expected of the Sleeping Kogoro!

362
00:22:08,302 --> 00:22:11,202
The great deduction that echoed throughout the snowy mountains of Gunma!

363
00:22:11,202 --> 00:22:14,802
I'm going back to the station and watch the video right away.

364
00:22:14,802 --> 00:22:16,702
Suit yourself.

365
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:19,502
I don't remember a thing.

366
00:22:19,502 --> 00:22:21,502
This is how I land up after all.

367
00:22:21,502 --> 00:22:22,902
What?

368
00:22:22,902 --> 00:22:25,102
Only the first part is taken.

369
00:22:26,502 --> 00:22:27,802
I see!

370
00:22:27,802 --> 00:22:31,102
I was shooting the film using pause to save tape.

371
00:22:31,102 --> 00:22:34,402
So he forgot to turn pause off.

372
00:22:34,402 --> 00:22:37,402
Mr. Mouri, why don't we go back for a retake?

373
00:22:39,102 --> 00:22:40,702
What an idiot.

374
00:22:40,702 --> 00:22:45,502
But this case was solved thanks to Eisuke.

375
00:22:45,502 --> 00:22:48,602
Because you mentioned about the bandage.

376
00:22:48,602 --> 00:22:52,402
Then, Conan noticed that the masking tape on the car was strange

377
00:22:52,402 --> 00:22:54,602
and went to tell dad about it, right?

378
00:22:56,402 --> 00:22:57,702
Sort of.

379
00:22:57,702 --> 00:23:00,502
You were outdone in your own forte, weren't you?

380
00:23:00,502 --> 00:23:01,702
Huh?

381
00:23:01,702 --> 00:23:03,602
In his own forte?

382
00:23:03,602 --> 00:23:06,002
It's usually this boy's role.

383
00:23:06,002 --> 00:23:08,602
He mentions something that seemingly has nothing to do with the case,

384
00:23:08,602 --> 00:23:12,102
but it coincidentally turns out to be the key to solving the case.

385
00:23:12,102 --> 00:23:13,102
Don't tell me...

386
00:23:15,302 --> 00:23:18,202
He does?

387
00:23:18,202 --> 00:23:19,502
Don't tell me...

388
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:24,502
Don't tell me that he...

389
00:23:26,402 --> 00:23:29,602
Well, if you want to see the Sleeping Kogoro again,

390
00:23:29,602 --> 00:23:32,402
you can come over anytime you like.

391
00:23:32,402 --> 00:23:33,402
Really?

392
00:23:34,502 --> 00:23:36,502
I did it!

393
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:38,802
Ouch...

394
00:23:42,202 --> 00:23:43,702
I guess not.

395
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,040
Next Conan's Hint:

396
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,040
"Rare card"

397
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,740
Give me that card, Mitsuhiko.

398
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,500
-No way. -I want it, too!

399
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,620
Here you go.
