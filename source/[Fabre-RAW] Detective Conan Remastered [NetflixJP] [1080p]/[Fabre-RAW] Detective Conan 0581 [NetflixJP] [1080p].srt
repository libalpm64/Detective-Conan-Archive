00:00:01,111 --> 00:00:05,011
"Beika Department Store"

2
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:35,211
Excuse me, sir?

3
00:00:35,211 --> 00:00:38,311
I'm sorry, I'll leave right away.

4
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:41,711
I just wanted to take a glimpse outside.

5
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:45,111
I mean, the whole floor is sabotaged by a bomb scare,

6
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:48,511
I can't make myself eat anything.

7
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:50,029
I see...

8
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:51,611
But, of course,

9
00:00:51,611 --> 00:00:53,411
I would sure like to give the guys who are hiding

10
00:00:53,411 --> 00:00:58,511
in this hot season waiting for their prey,

11
00:00:58,511 --> 00:01:02,411
a taste of hot bitter coffee, if I had my way.

12
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:06,045
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

13
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:08,311
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

14
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:10,911
The overall picture of the bomb scare is finally revealed.

15
00:01:10,911 --> 00:01:12,911
As well as well as the fate of Akai's phantom.

16
00:01:12,911 --> 00:01:14,611
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:16,411
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:18,611
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

19
00:02:59,694 --> 00:03:01,394
In order to solve the mystery of the red T-shirts

20
00:03:01,394 --> 00:03:03,594
that were being sent every week,

21
00:03:03,594 --> 00:03:05,094
we headed off to Beika Department Store

22
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:06,994
and what lay waiting for us

23
00:03:06,994 --> 00:03:10,594
was a man with a bomb wrapped around his body.

24
00:03:10,594 --> 00:03:13,794
The masked man who wrapped a bomb around this man

25
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:18,794
wants to find the T-shirts's sender that was supposedly on this floor.

26
00:03:18,794 --> 00:03:20,794
Although it was found that all 13 T-shirts

27
00:03:20,794 --> 00:03:25,894
were bought at 12:28 pm every Sunday,

28
00:03:25,894 --> 00:03:29,594
the salesclerk says that she has no recollection who bought them.

29
00:03:29,594 --> 00:03:31,694
What on earth is going on?

30
00:03:33,294 --> 00:03:36,494
From the queer creases that were found on the red T-shirts,

31
00:03:36,494 --> 00:03:39,294
I figured out that the snow mountain accident

32
00:03:39,294 --> 00:03:41,094
that occurred more than 10 years ago

33
00:03:41,094 --> 00:03:44,203
to a mountain climber was connected to this incident.

34
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,194
Wait, dad!

35
00:03:49,194 --> 00:03:52,211
That's right near the bomb.

36
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:54,213
I'll be fine.

37
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:56,894
I won't let the bomb go off.

38
00:03:56,894 --> 00:03:58,694
Isn't that right?

39
00:03:58,694 --> 00:04:00,894
Bomb man?

40
00:04:03,794 --> 00:04:06,225
Mr. Ordinary Citizen?

41
00:04:08,994 --> 00:04:14,794
"The Target that Sways Red"

42
00:04:14,794 --> 00:04:17,494
No, I...

43
00:04:17,494 --> 00:04:20,239
Seeing that although it's 12:28 pm,

44
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,794
no one came to buy the wear,

45
00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:24,894
so you figured.

46
00:04:24,894 --> 00:04:28,794
It was the trap set by the sender

47
00:04:28,794 --> 00:04:30,794
of the T-shirts to lure you out here.

48
00:04:30,794 --> 00:04:32,251
That's why you're

49
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:36,794
trying to get that hateful sender of the T-shirts to come out!

50
00:04:36,794 --> 00:04:39,094
Get him to come out, how?

51
00:04:39,094 --> 00:04:41,194
If the sender knew the man's address,

52
00:04:41,194 --> 00:04:45,294
he must also know the face of that man.

53
00:04:45,294 --> 00:04:47,694
Because the man made a fuss saying

54
00:04:47,694 --> 00:04:51,594
that the bomb would go off unless the sender is found,

55
00:04:51,594 --> 00:04:53,694
he probably hoped

56
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:57,394
that the sender would come out declaring that it's a lie.

57
00:04:57,394 --> 00:05:00,794
Well, I've already figured out who the sender is

58
00:05:00,794 --> 00:05:03,694
without having to use a complicated method such as he, though.

59
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:05,894
What? Really?

60
00:05:05,894 --> 00:05:08,287
The receipts!

61
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:15,094
I don't think he'll be able to get a receipt indicating 12:28 pm.

62
00:05:15,094 --> 00:05:18,994
If he asked to have a receipt with that time indicated,

63
00:05:18,994 --> 00:05:21,594
he could probably have it done.

64
00:05:21,594 --> 00:05:24,303
But if such a queer shopper came,

65
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:27,794
the salesclerk is bound to remember.

66
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:31,394
The fact that the salesclerks don't recall such a person

67
00:05:31,394 --> 00:05:34,894
is because the sender himself is the one who issued the receipts.

68
00:05:34,894 --> 00:05:38,317
In other words, it's the cashier

69
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:41,394
at the fitness section that carries red underwear.

70
00:05:41,394 --> 00:05:44,894
Ms. Seta, it's you, isn't it?

71
00:05:44,894 --> 00:05:48,327
The cash register of that section is in a small room

72
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:51,294
that is not visible to the customers or salesclerks.

73
00:05:51,294 --> 00:05:53,094
Therefore, it's easy to issue

74
00:05:53,094 --> 00:05:57,294
a receipt indicating 12:28 pm without being suspected.

75
00:05:57,294 --> 00:05:59,894
It is also very likely that the sender

76
00:05:59,894 --> 00:06:03,094
and recipient know each other's face.

77
00:06:03,094 --> 00:06:08,347
Nevertheless, the fact that the recipient couldn't find you,

78
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:11,794
that's the further proof that the sender was you,

79
00:06:11,794 --> 00:06:13,594
who had been hiding in that small room all this time.

80
00:06:13,594 --> 00:06:15,894
Mai... Mai?

81
00:06:15,894 --> 00:06:17,594
Are you Mai?

82
00:06:17,594 --> 00:06:19,694
Mr. Maruoka's daughter?

83
00:06:19,694 --> 00:06:22,361
Yes, that's right, Mr. Fukunishi!

84
00:06:22,594 --> 00:06:24,794
My father, who you killed

85
00:06:24,794 --> 00:06:26,894
on those snowy mountains 13 years ago.

86
00:06:26,894 --> 00:06:30,094
I'm Daisaku Maruoka's daughter!

87
00:06:30,094 --> 00:06:33,494
Don't call me using honorific as if you know me or something!

88
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:35,894
No, he got caught in an avalanche and...

89
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:40,894
Right, the avalanche that happened worked to your advantage

90
00:06:40,894 --> 00:06:44,383
and the police didn't check the case any further.

91
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:47,994
It was closed as a mere case of accident in the snow!

92
00:06:47,994 --> 00:06:52,994
But, on Sunday December 28th, 13 years ago,

93
00:06:52,994 --> 00:06:56,394
the morning that you and dad went mountain climbing,

94
00:06:56,394 --> 00:06:58,794
it was written in dad's diary!

95
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:01,994
That if you saw the grand scenery of a summit for the first time,

96
00:07:01,994 --> 00:07:05,194
you would probably turn over a new leaf.

97
00:07:05,194 --> 00:07:08,994
After dad's death, dad was suspected of embezzlement!

98
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:11,094
You used up the money of the company

99
00:07:11,094 --> 00:07:14,694
and put the blame on dad who was your superior, too!

100
00:07:14,694 --> 00:07:16,415
I know that!

101
00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:19,794
What... What're you talking about, Mai?

102
00:07:19,794 --> 00:07:22,421
I see, so she's the one.

103
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:25,894
She's the one who...

104
00:07:25,894 --> 00:07:28,427
So, are you satisfied?

105
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:30,694
Let my son go!

106
00:07:30,694 --> 00:07:33,494
Son? What's that about?

107
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:37,594
You're made me do something like this with this letter, right?

108
00:07:37,594 --> 00:07:38,894
Letter?

109
00:07:38,894 --> 00:07:40,439
Please let me see it.

110
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:44,094
I have your son.

111
00:07:44,094 --> 00:07:45,594
If you want him back,

112
00:07:45,594 --> 00:07:47,994
wrap the bomb that's inside around your body

113
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:49,794
and set the remaining bombs

114
00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:53,694
to Beika Department Store and sabotage the entire sports floor.

115
00:07:53,694 --> 00:07:55,194
Plead your heart out begging for your life

116
00:07:55,194 --> 00:07:58,094
unless you find the sender.

117
00:07:58,094 --> 00:08:01,294
If I get to burst out laughing watching you do this,

118
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:03,494
I'll give you back your son.

119
00:08:03,494 --> 00:08:06,894
I know nothing about that letter.

120
00:08:06,894 --> 00:08:08,194
You've got to be joking!

121
00:08:08,194 --> 00:08:11,294
My son's been missing since last week!

122
00:08:11,294 --> 00:08:12,471
-What? -What?

123
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:15,394
Come on, give me back my son!

124
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:19,094
I see. This is what your purpose was.

125
00:08:19,094 --> 00:08:21,494
What? Dad?

126
00:08:21,494 --> 00:08:27,394
Ms. Seta's weakness was that she kept sending red underwear every week.

127
00:08:27,394 --> 00:08:30,094
You felt strong because if you didn't receive such letter,

128
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:34,194
you would never had caused this bomb scare to begin with.

129
00:08:34,194 --> 00:08:37,494
That's why you made up that fake threat letter

130
00:08:37,494 --> 00:08:41,794
and decided that you would deepen the crime of the sender!

131
00:08:41,794 --> 00:08:43,694
Because you had no idea that Ms. Seta

132
00:08:43,694 --> 00:08:49,994
had conclusive proof that you were the one who killed her father.

133
00:08:49,994 --> 00:08:52,794
Conclusive proof?

134
00:08:52,794 --> 00:08:54,513
What kind of proof?

135
00:08:54,694 --> 00:08:58,094
Don't be ridiculous. She'll never have anything like that.

136
00:08:58,094 --> 00:09:02,794
The 13 red underwear that Ms. Seta sent you!

137
00:09:02,794 --> 00:09:06,525
The fact that the way the shirts were folded according to the crease,

138
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:09,094
is the shape for a flag signal.

139
00:09:09,094 --> 00:09:10,794
Flag signals...

140
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:13,294
That's when you relay words by waving a red and white flag

141
00:09:13,294 --> 00:09:15,394
that you hold in each hand, right?

142
00:09:15,394 --> 00:09:16,535
Right.

143
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:20,794
If you read it according to the order the shirts were sent...

144
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:26,545
Buried...

145
00:09:26,794 --> 00:09:28,547
I...

146
00:09:28,794 --> 00:09:31,494
saw...

147
00:09:31,494 --> 00:09:33,194
you...

148
00:09:33,194 --> 00:09:36,555
-do it... -Buried, I saw you do it.

149
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:39,494
Does that mean, the place the body was buried?

150
00:09:41,394 --> 00:09:43,694
So, you been bluffing after all!

151
00:09:43,694 --> 00:09:45,294
Bluff?

152
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:46,894
It has to be!

153
00:09:46,894 --> 00:09:49,094
Because back then the blizzard was so bad

154
00:09:49,094 --> 00:09:50,294
that you couldn't even keep your eyes open.

155
00:09:50,294 --> 00:09:52,994
Even if there have been someone other than me there.

156
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:58,577
Are you saying, no one could've seen you burying the body?

157
00:09:58,577 --> 00:09:59,994
No... That's...

158
00:09:59,994 --> 00:10:02,094
According to Mr. Maruoka's diary,

159
00:10:02,094 --> 00:10:04,294
mountain climbing was a first time experience for you.

160
00:10:04,294 --> 00:10:06,194
Therefore, being a novice,

161
00:10:06,194 --> 00:10:08,194
you couldn't have left the mountain hut

162
00:10:08,194 --> 00:10:10,589
that you were in to go and bury him.

163
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:14,594
Which means if we dig the area near the mountain hut you stayed,

164
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:17,694
then we should be able to find the corpse, right?

165
00:10:17,694 --> 00:10:20,594
The corpse of the mountain climber

166
00:10:20,594 --> 00:10:23,294
that you killed and buried 13 years ago.

167
00:10:23,294 --> 00:10:25,494
You seem to be very sure

168
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:27,994
that nobody was watching you

169
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:31,694
but there was a witness.

170
00:10:31,694 --> 00:10:35,094
And that's you, the one who murdered him.

171
00:10:59,794 --> 00:11:04,394
By the way, is your son really gone?

172
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:07,894
Yes, I think he ran away from home like always.

173
00:11:07,894 --> 00:11:09,494
I'm stupid.

174
00:11:09,494 --> 00:11:11,794
I embezzled the company money because I wanted to enroll my son

175
00:11:11,794 --> 00:11:14,194
into a famous elementary school.

176
00:11:14,194 --> 00:11:18,194
I even killed my superior who scolded me for it.

177
00:11:18,194 --> 00:11:21,894
And my son's ran away from home too.

178
00:11:23,194 --> 00:11:25,794
Then, will someone call the police

179
00:11:25,794 --> 00:11:28,094
and take Ms. Seta and him to the station?

180
00:11:28,094 --> 00:11:29,294
Yes, sir.

181
00:11:29,294 --> 00:11:31,194
Please announce to the customers here

182
00:11:31,194 --> 00:11:33,294
that the bombs in the paper bags on this floor

183
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:36,194
are fakes that only emit smoke!

184
00:11:36,194 --> 00:11:37,594
Yes, sir.

185
00:11:39,894 --> 00:11:43,994
Besides, I'm sure that the riot police called by Ms. Seta

186
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,685
are also nearby too.

187
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:49,994
Yes, I told them to arrest him right away

188
00:11:49,994 --> 00:11:52,691
because I figured all the bombs were fake anyway,

189
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:55,194
but they wouldn't do it.

190
00:11:55,194 --> 00:11:59,594
How did you figure out that the bombs were fake, Dad?

191
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:03,094
From the lipstick on his shoulder.

192
00:12:03,094 --> 00:12:06,394
If he really had a real bomb attached to his body,

193
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:10,394
he would never ride a crowded train, that's why.

194
00:12:10,394 --> 00:12:13,494
So, that completes the job offer we got for this case,

195
00:12:13,494 --> 00:12:17,294
but are you satisfied, Ms. Seta?

196
00:12:17,294 --> 00:12:20,494
Yes, sir! So, you knew after all.

197
00:12:20,494 --> 00:12:24,394
That I use a voice changer to call you.

198
00:12:24,394 --> 00:12:26,725
All I wanted is for you to reveal

199
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:28,494
the meaning of the flag signal that dad taught me

200
00:12:28,494 --> 00:12:30,729
and watch what kind of face he would wear

201
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:34,094
after hearing it from you.

202
00:12:34,094 --> 00:12:36,994
But, to hear him confessing what he did,

203
00:12:36,994 --> 00:12:38,994
you're really great after all.

204
00:12:38,994 --> 00:12:40,739
With only that little hint,

205
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:42,494
you realized that it was the accident

206
00:12:42,494 --> 00:12:45,294
at the snowy mountain that occurred on December 28th,

207
00:12:45,294 --> 00:12:47,994
and made the little boy check on it.

208
00:12:47,994 --> 00:12:50,094
-That's... -Flag signals

209
00:12:50,094 --> 00:12:51,794
are used in places like the ocean

210
00:12:51,794 --> 00:12:54,753
and mountains where voices are hard to hear.

211
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:57,194
If the message was, "I saw you bury him"

212
00:12:57,194 --> 00:13:01,594
it has to be the mountains and not the sea.

213
00:13:01,594 --> 00:13:06,094
And the right half of the receipts are deliberately torn off

214
00:13:06,094 --> 00:13:08,394
bringing to mind a snowy mountain.

215
00:13:08,394 --> 00:13:12,294
The red colour of the underwear suggests murder.

216
00:13:12,294 --> 00:13:13,994
If murder is committed in the snow mountain,

217
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,894
it'll have something to do with accident in the snow

218
00:13:15,894 --> 00:13:19,994
and it'll be difficult to determine the exact time.

219
00:13:19,994 --> 00:13:22,294
I'm sure that the time 12:28 pm

220
00:13:22,294 --> 00:13:26,394
indicates the date December 28.

221
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:30,394
That's what's written on the mail

222
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:33,794
that was sent to me by somebody I don't know.

223
00:13:33,794 --> 00:13:35,894
Let... Let me see it.

224
00:13:38,594 --> 00:13:41,794
And, what's come of the bomb scare?

225
00:13:41,794 --> 00:13:42,801
What?

226
00:13:43,894 --> 00:13:46,094
Mail from somebody he doesn't know?

227
00:13:49,694 --> 00:13:51,694
Who on earth can it be?

228
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:02,070
Who on earth could've sent him this mail?

229
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,870
The only thing I can say

230
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,570
is that he sender of this mail was definitely

231
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:09,770
on this floor till just a while ago.

232
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,670
What's the matter, Conan?

233
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,670
Nothing...

234
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,770
I was thinking that the person who sent this mail

235
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,070
is a really great detective.

236
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,070
-Mail? -Look.

237
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:24,070
Well, I'll leave the rest to you.

238
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,845
-You must feel hot... -It's true!

239
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:31,170
Dad, don't tell me that you were just reading this mail.

240
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,870
But, the fact that the sender is me,

241
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,853
the daughter of the mountain climber

242
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,570
who was killed in the snowy mountains 13 years ago,

243
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,570
was unmentioned, does it?

244
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:43,870
Boy, you knew about it from Detective Mouri, right?

245
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,670
After all, you called me by my maiden name, Maruoka,

246
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,869
instead of the name on this name plate, Seta.

247
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:53,870
Yes! When I went into the cash register room

248
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,670
because I wanted to check on the accident that happened

249
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,970
in the snowy mountain on December 28th,

250
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,370
and asked you to lend me the computer,

251
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,470
you weren't surprised, were you?

252
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,270
That's how I figured out

253
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,885
you were the one who wanted this case checked

254
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:10,670
and were somehow involved with the accident in the mountain.

255
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,470
In the picture with Mr. Maruoka who died in the mountain,

256
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,893
his daughter was in it too.

257
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:17,870
And, you were wearing a wedding ring,

258
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,670
so I thought maybe you got married and your last name changed!

259
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,901
Really...

260
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:25,270
You're really something, aren't you, Conan?

261
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,370
Of... Of course.

262
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:32,470
I did all of what I did because Pops told me to do it.

263
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,870
Just as would be expected of the Sleeping Kogoro!

264
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,870
But, the sender of this mail is quite a great detective himself!

265
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,570
Everything aside from your identity hit the bull's eye.

266
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,570
I wonder who it is?

267
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,925
Maybe that person is still here on this floor.

268
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:49,470
Then, maybe if you send a thank you mail,

269
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,929
that person will appear?

270
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:52,370
No, way.

271
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,570
From what's written there,

272
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,570
it seems that the person doesn't want to get involved.

273
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,941
What?

274
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,670
Maybe it's him?

275
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,870
I'm sorry!

276
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,670
Did you just receive mail that said, "Thank you?"

277
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,170
Yes, I did.

278
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,955
Then, are you the one who made that deduction?

279
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,959
No, I don't know anything about this mail.

280
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,963
What? But, the mail was sent from your cell phone, right?

281
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,470
Yes.

282
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,370
It could be the person who picked up my cell phone a while ago.

283
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,370
A man who was wearing a black cap

284
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,670
and had a burn scar on his right cheek.

285
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,975
What?

286
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:38,970
Where is that man?

287
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,070
Yes.

288
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,470
He went over to the escalator that started moving.

289
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,670
I think he went downstairs?

290
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:46,985
Conan?

291
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,770
What's up? What's the rush?

292
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,997
Jodie.

293
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:03,870
Don't tell me you're looking for the same person I am?

294
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,570
No.

295
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,770
Just as the message in question said,

296
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,009
it seems that this place is definitely dangerous.

297
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:14,070
Message in question?

298
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:17,370
The message that Shu gave me!

299
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,770
You met him? Mr. Akai?

300
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:23,770
No, when I left my seat for a while at the cafe in the basement,

301
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:27,025
he secretly wrote it in the back of the coaster!

302
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:31,870
And, why is it dangerous here?

303
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,270
The bomb scare incident's been solved, right?

304
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,070
Because I saw it.

305
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,770
A sniper-like person was seen from a window of the hotel opposite

306
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,039
this department store.

307
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,370
And parked right below, is a black Porsche 356A.

308
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,370
Gin!

309
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:49,670
Don't tell me, that he found out that Shu is alive

310
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,370
and is planning to shoot him?

311
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,870
Shu!

312
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,053
Where are you, Shu?

313
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,770
There he is. It's Shu!

314
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,070
No, Shu!

315
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,770
Don't go out!

316
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,670
They're coming after you!

317
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,070
Shu!

318
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:16,270
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

319
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:19,770
The rate of taking the blame would be fifty-fifty.

320
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,570
You weren't careful and attentive enough,

321
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,570
you're to be blame too.

322
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,770
Yes.

323
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,870
You looked to have been looking for someone?

324
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:28,870
Shu!

325
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,089
Where are you, Shu?

326
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,970
There he is! I found him!

327
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,170
I found the phantom!

328
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:40,770
On the left edge of the main entrance.

329
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,370
Right to the side of your car!

330
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:46,070
Hurry up and check it out if you're going to, Gin!

331
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,170
Because my finger that's on the trigger

332
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,170
is impatiently waiting and twitching

333
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,870
and may go off any minute!

334
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,470
Akai Shuichi.

335
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,070
Vermouth.

336
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,129
Did you get approval from that person?

337
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:14,670
Yes, boss is very discreet and careful.

338
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,170
Maybe too careful that the timing goes off.

339
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,770
What the heck are you doing?

340
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,570
Can I kill him? Or not?

341
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,870
Which is it going to be?

342
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,470
What the...

343
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,770
He looked...

344
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,970
That guy!

345
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,970
He looked this way!

346
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,670
He looked at me and laughed!

347
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,153
Do I kill him or not?

348
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:37,155
What do I do?

349
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:39,970
Gin, it's strange, right?

350
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:44,370
The customers are rushing back into the department store.

351
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,870
Where is he? Where'd he go?

352
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,167
The shoppers are suddenly rushing along.

353
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:50,570
It's hard to lock him on.

354
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:53,670
Hey, doesn't it look bad?

355
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,173
She's got a rifle.

356
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,070
Maybe their shooting a film or something?

357
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,470
-Let's go. -What?

358
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,170
Tell Korn too.

359
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,185
Hey, just what's going on? Gin...

360
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,670
Priority on his own discretion again.

361
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,191
Revolting like always.

362
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:16,270
What? Who are you talking about?

363
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,570
Like you said,

364
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:22,370
you wish they leave detectives

365
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:25,870
like Sherlock Holmes locked up in novels only.

366
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:49,870
Hey, hurry up and give me the gift certificate!

367
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,970
You're giving us 10,000 yen worth, aren't you?

368
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,970
Just what're you talking about?

369
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,070
A boy wearing glasses went around shouting

370
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,770
that as an apology of the bomb scare,

371
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:03,070
you're giving away gift certificate to all the customers who came!

372
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:06,770
I haven't heard anything sort of thing.

373
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,070
Hey, come on, man!

374
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,309
I came all the way back here.

375
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,670
I see, gift certificates, right?

376
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:17,315
I wouldn't say that it was too bright.

377
00:22:17,315 --> 00:22:19,070
But, I guess it couldn't be helped

378
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,319
if you wanted to evacuate the customers from here, right?

379
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:23,321
Subaru?

380
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:25,970
I had some business to take care of at the Teito Bank

381
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,325
near this department store.

382
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:30,170
So, I did what I had to do and came out saw you all,

383
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:33,770
and ran after you thinking to call you,

384
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,070
and got messed up in the incident.

385
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,170
Who is this guy?

386
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:41,339
I hear that his apartment was burnt down.

387
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:43,670
He lives at Shinichi's house for the time being,

388
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,270
and his name is Mr. Subaru Okiya, a university student.

389
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,670
I see...

390
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,670
But, what was that about?

391
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:53,351
Conan evacuating the customers a while ago.

392
00:22:55,353 --> 00:22:57,870
It's not worth hearing about.

393
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,670
It's a worthless story

394
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,270
about a bunch of stupid wolves letting the prey

395
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,370
that they hunted down get away.

396
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:09,670
But, you live quite a distance away from Teito Bank, don't you?

397
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,170
Why would you have a saving account in a place like that?

398
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,371
No.

399
00:23:13,371 --> 00:23:16,770
I had other things to do at that bank.

400
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,370
Other things to do?

401
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:22,970
Remember the robbery at that bank some time ago?

402
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,383
In the news that was aired to look back on that case,

403
00:23:25,383 --> 00:23:27,370
I saw my acquaintance.

404
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:32,370
I went there thinking that maybe he was using that bank.

405
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:35,670
If he's using that bank, he should be living in this vicinity.

406
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,770
I was hoping to get lucky and run into him.

407
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:42,270
So, you didn't get to see him?

408
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:45,970
Well, I coincidentally saw him on that floor.

409
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,570
But, unfortunately, it seemed to be someone else,

410
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,370
so I didn't call out to him.

411
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:55,970
His face is one that I've known for a long time,

412
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,570
so I'd never mistaken him for someone else.

413
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

414
00:24:03,678 --> 00:24:05,423
"Strawberry"

415
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,710
This strawberry is very delicious.

416
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,880
Strawberry is very...
