1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,540
 The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,440
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,140
This is an eerie 3-part story.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,940
The map of the fires are trying to tell us something.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,640
His name is Detective Conan.

8
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,360
"Red Horse In The Fire (Case)"

9
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,860
So, that was when I told that lady to back off.

10
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,160
I told her to give in,

11
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,360
that she had no chance of winning this game.

12
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,560
But it's all thanks to Pops.

13
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,260
Because he solved the hidden message that Heiji had put in the code

14
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,860
and saved us.

15
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,060
What?

16
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,360
-We... -Well, let bygones be bygones!

17
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,860
Pops, your glass is empty.

18
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,560
Here, have another shot.

19
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,760
You're the one who brought the subject up.

20
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,460
But that lady was really the pits.

21
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,260
She tried to burn us to death.

22
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,960
Burn you to death?

23
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,660
She was going to set fire to her own house

24
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,460
and tell the court that somebody who held a grudge on her

25
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,760
set fire to her house,

26
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,660
didn't make it out of the house in time and burned to death.

27
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,360
Well, that sure was dangerous.

28
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,760
If worse came to worse, it could've been blamed on

29
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,960
the arsonist that's been causing panic in this area.

30
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,560
An arsonist?

31
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,960
From the start of this year,

32
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,760
there have been a series of arson cases.

33
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,160
A series, which means that the method of arson is the same?

34
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,760
No. There's no similarity in the method of arson,

35
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,360
but there's always this one thing left at the site of the fire.

36
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,660
A doll of a red horse.

37
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,060
A red horse?

38
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,560
I see.

39
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,260
The arsonist is hinting on the code word of the police "Red horse".

40
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,460
What?

41
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,860
The arsonist is probably making fun of the police

42
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,260
and provoking the police,

43
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:43,560
"I'm the arsonist. Catch me if you can."

44
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,260
Well, but it's fortunate that

45
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,060
nobody died in the three arsons committed so far.

46
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,360
And? Are the three cases connected in any way?

47
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,360
Well, it seems that these three cases are not connected at all.

48
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,160
The addresses are scattered, too.

49
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,660
The first one was at Rizencho 1-chome,

50
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,960
the second at Toriyacho 2-chome

51
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,760
and the third at Okuhocho 3-chome.

52
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,360
Which means the next arson will be in the 4-chome area somewhere.

53
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,760
Yeah.

54
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,260
If the arsonist is setting fire at random, it's possible,

55
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,360
so the police is keeping an eye on the 4-chome area within town.

56
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,660
But there are so many 4-chomes all over the place.

57
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,160
But I know of a house that may be a target.

58
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,760
What?

59
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,760
I was asked by Mr. Kusukawa a while ago

60
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,860
to go over to a person's house

61
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,760
to take over investigation of a suspicious person

62
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,360
that was seen late at night loitering around a house

63
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,960
near Haidocho 4-chome.

64
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,560
Well, I don't really have anywhere to go this holiday,

65
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,160
so I'll take Pops and this kid go to that person's house tomorrow.

66
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
Okay, kid?

67
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,560
You can take dad, but not Conan.

68
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,660
What?

69
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,760
Excursion?

70
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,760
We may be able to get a clue to the serial arsonist

71
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,360
and you're going to go hand in hand on an excursion, you brat?

72
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,260
What's the big deal? He's only a kid.

73
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,860
But I wonder if the weather's going to be okay. It's still raining.

74
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,660
It'll be fine, because of this!

75
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,460
This sunny boy doll always cleared the weather

76
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,160
for Shinichi's important soccer matches.

77
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,660
Ran, you make me so jealous!

78
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,960
Well, it's hard going to root for him in the rain besides.

79
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,860
That's why it's most likely going to be a fine day tomorrow, Conan.

80
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,260
Yes.

81
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,960
"Mouri Detective Agency"

82
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,460
Strange.

83
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,760
The odds of the rain clearing used to be 100%.

84
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,860
Maybe you didn't wish hard enough, Ran.

85
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,360
Because it's not for Shinichi.

86
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,460
Don't be ridiculous! That's not true!

87
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,560
Huh? Strange.

88
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,960
When we hung it out last night,

89
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,860
it was facing out towards the window.

90
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,860
Well, it can't be helped.

91
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,860
The weather depends on the mood of the sun.

92
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,760
Don't tell me that he...

93
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,460
Your sunny boy doll's starting to take effect now?

94
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,860
Well, too bad.

95
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,460
The heavens are going to punish you one of these days.

96
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,260
We'll do some more shopping and go home.

97
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,560
Heiji and Pops, work hard at your detective job!

98
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,760
Yeah.

99
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,260
Let's go, Conan.

100
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,160
Those two really get along well, don't they?

101
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,460
Kazuha, don't tell me that you're jealous of Conan?

102
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,360
That's not it!

103
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,260
And? What time and where in 4-chome?

104
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,160
What? Let's see.

105
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,660
Haidocho 4-chome at the Moromizu residence at 16:00.

106
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,960
Don't worry, because Pop's agency is not on 4-chome.

107
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,660
I see.

108
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,360
"Morozumi" -There! Here it is!

109
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,660
But we're 30 minutes late for the appointment.

110
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,760
What should we do?

111
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,360
It's only 30 minutes.

112
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,860
Mr. Kusukawa told me not to be late

113
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,060
because this person's really fussy about time.

114
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,960
Hello.

115
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,560
I don't need any!

116
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,360
Please leave!

117
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,960
I'm going to call the police if you don't!

118
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,860
So like I told you, I'm not here to sell anything to you.

119
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,060
"Takanori Genda (42)" -I just brought some catalogs of

120
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,160
the hanging scrolls and vases that we sell in our store.

121
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,960
I've been telling you for a while now.

122
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,360
I'm not interested in dusty junk like that!

123
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,260
Then I'll leave our catalog and a key holder

124
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,460
that will bring about good business,

125
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,360
so please stop by at our shop when you feel like it.

126
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,460
No need to worry. I'm not so hard up for money

127
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,660
that I have to rely on something like that!

128
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,160
Go on! And leave right this minute!

129
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,560
I'm sorry to have intruded on you.

130
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,860
And? Now, what's with all of you?

131
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,860
Well, we're detectives here in place of Mr. Kusukawa.

132
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,060
Never mind that case already.

133
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,560
It seems to have been my imagination.

134
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,060
What?

135
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,460
Hey. What's the story?

136
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,060
It can't be helped

137
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,360
because Mr. Kusukawa was confined from 3 days ago.

138
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,660
But, isn't it strange to say that it was just her imagination

139
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,760
when she was troubled enough to hire a detective?

140
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,560
Yeah. I swear there's something fishy about that lady.

141
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,360
Hello.

142
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,660
You're early today, Sensei.

143
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,360
See! I did just as you told me.

144
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,960
"Misao Soga (45)" -From Feng Shui's point of view,

145
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,660
it is very good to decorate ceramic ware,

146
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,060
which is said to be great for any direction,

147
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,460
at the front door of the house that is the entrance of good luck.

148
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,160
Well, let's talk inside.

149
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,860
He's just a teacher of Feng Shui.

150
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,360
May I help you?

151
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,160
Nothing really.

152
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,560
Talk about a lot of make-up.

153
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,260
Hey, what's with you?

154
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,560
I thought I told you not to come here anymore, Keiko!

155
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,760
Don't get angry at me, Ryoko.

156
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,960
I've been unlucky this month.

157
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
So, I wonder if you can spare 100,000 yen...

158
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,560
No, 50,000 yen will do.

159
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,160
If you're unlucky, why don't you do something about it

160
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,660
with your own fortune-telling?

161
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,060
She's a fortune-teller.

162
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,860
Gosh. Two hours have passed already.

163
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,360
Waiting in a place like this is going to get us nowhere.

164
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,460
But the man that just went in hasn't come out yet.

165
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,860
I'll go check inside.

166
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,860
Hey!

167
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,260
Hey, you!

168
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,860
He seems to be looking for something.

169
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,060
Yeah.

170
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,360
Too bad.

171
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,360
It's not there, no matter how hard you look.

172
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,860
It's a video tape that is proof of our relationship,

173
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,460
so of course I hid it someplace very special in this house.

174
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,960
I'm keeping it as a guarantee that you will divorce your wife

175
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,260
and marry me instead, Sensei.

176
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,460
My husband will be coming home soon.

177
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,960
You're going drinking with your college friends, aren't you?

178
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,860
You may relax on the sofa till then.

179
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,860
Really, I don't understand adults, honestly.

180
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,460
It's scary because even your relationship with your wife

181
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,760
who you've been living separately from all these years seem to look better.

182
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,060
Be quite.

183
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,060
Hey.

184
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,560
Isn't that guy from before?

185
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,860
Who?

186
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,060
I wonder what he's doing.

187
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,260
He's probably working overtime because he can't fill his quota.

188
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,360
It seems her husband's finally come home.

189
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,960
I'm home.

190
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,360
Oh, my. Hello, dear.

191
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,460
Hello, Morosumi.

192
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,460
-Soga, you're here already. -Yeah.

193
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,460
"Akira Morosumi (45), Psychiatrist" -Let me use the bathroom.

194
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,860
Can you get the engine running while you're waiting?

195
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,260
No. If you're going out drinking, walk.

196
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,960
Okay.

197
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,460
And would you like to come along too, for a change?

198
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,260
No thank you, because I can't drink.

199
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,360
I also want to watch the soccer game that will be aired at midnight,

200
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,560
so I'd like to take a short nap, too.

201
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,160
Really? Too bad.

202
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,960
The conversation that the two men would have over drinks

203
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,460
drew some interest, but...

204
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,160
How long do you intend to stay fooling around out there?

205
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,460
Hurry up and come on home!

206
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:58,660
We got a call from Ran, so we decided to head on home.

207
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,760
But...

208
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,160
Hey, Heiji! Just what do you think you're doing?

209
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,460
I went out of my way to make dinner for you,

210
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,460
and it's all cold already!

211
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,260
Where are you now?

212
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,960
The Morosumi residence where I accepted the work of the detective.

213
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,260
What?

214
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,360
You just said you're headed home because you finished the job!

215
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,160
Yeah, that's what we were planning to do,

216
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,260
but we passed a fire engine on the way back.

217
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,160
We got concerned and headed back to the residence

218
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,460
and found it blazing outrageously.

219
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,460
What?

220
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,060
The Morosumi residence...

221
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,080
Hey, this way! Hurry!

222
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,380
Ryoko...

223
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,980
Ryoko...

224
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,880
It seems like that woman didn't escape in time.

225
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,980
Gosh. If we just kept watching,

226
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,280
this wouldn't have happened.

227
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,280
But isn't it strange?

228
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,380
Those two went out to drink, right?

229
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,280
Not even an hour has past yet,

230
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,680
and I wonder why they came back?

231
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,280
True.

232
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,980
Maybe they had a premonition of some kind?

233
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,480
See, mommy? It came after all, didn't it?

234
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,780
A red horse that causes fire.

235
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,480
What?

236
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,380
Hey, kid. How come you knew that a red horse was coming?

237
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,080
Because I saw it.

238
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,980
When and where?

239
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,580
Hey, who are you people?

240
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,480
You really saw it?

241
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,680
I'm not lying! It was only the shadow of the horse, but...

242
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,480
-Shadow? -Yes.

243
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,880
It was when I was watching Kamen Yaiba in the living room.

244
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,780
When Yaiba's first song started,

245
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,880
it suddenly got bright outside,

246
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,780
so I looked outside and was surprised.

247
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:56,180
A shadow of a horse about this big was on the curtain!

248
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,480
Which way is your house?

249
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,080
On the right of the burning house? Or, on the left?

250
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,480
To the right.

251
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,680
Hey!

252
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,580
A horse!

253
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,880
By the window, there's a red horse!

254
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,880
Which means that the room that boy was watching TV in, is this room.

255
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,580
Yeah. The shadow of the horse showed up on this curtain.

256
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,480
Kaimen Yaiba starts at 7:30 pm.

257
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,180
If it got bright during the opening of the program

258
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,580
and the shadow was reflected...

259
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,680
The arsonist set fire and put the horse in place a little

260
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,480
after 7:30 pm.

261
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,080
Yeah. At least we know that the arsonist

262
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,680
was near this window about that time.

263
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,780
So, the horse set the fire after all, right, mommy?

264
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,880
Two hours later,

265
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,080
the fire that took the life of Ryoko Morosumi

266
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,580
was finally extinguished.

267
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,880
Will you let me in just for a minute?

268
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,380
No way.

269
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,980
Then, will you at least tell me where the fire first broke out?

270
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,180
No way.

271
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,380
What's the big deal giving out a little info?

272
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:23,480
I can't do what I can't do, even if it's for you, Mr. Mouri.

273
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,080
Hey, hey. The scene of a fire

274
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,280
is not territory for the homicide division, is it?

275
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,180
Old man fire of the 1st division?

276
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,480
Hey, Mouri!

277
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,980
How dare you call your former superior old man fire!

278
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,880
Former superior?

279
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,380
Inspector Yuminaga of the Metropolitan Police

280
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,480
Arson Investigation Division section 1.

281
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,380
I thought you belonged to the homicide division?

282
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,380
I used to be in the arson division for a little while.

283
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,480
You sure caused me a lot of agony.

284
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,580
Every time there's a fire, you claim that it's arson

285
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,280
and go out to the scene of the fire,

286
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,980
and step all over the personal effects left there.

287
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,080
God knows how many complaints I got of you from the fire department.

288
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,480
Right?

289
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,980
The same goes for you, too.

290
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,780
This fire is undoubtedly arson.

291
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,680
The red horse was found at the site of this fire, too.

292
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,180
We checked it out with the forensic officers

293
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,780
and found that it was a perfect match with the other three horses.

294
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,680
But Mr. Yuminaga, isn't there a possibility

295
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,680
that somebody who saw the incident in the newspaper or something

296
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,580
tried copying?

297
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,080
You idiot!

298
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,780
How can you make the exact same horse

299
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,780
by just seeing it in the papers?

300
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,480
That plastic horse is made of the same mold,

301
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,580
and is not sold anywhere,

302
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,980
so the arsonist probably took fun in making it himself.

303
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,080
The arsonist was probably having fun challenging the police,

304
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,480
but somebody has been killed this time.

305
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,080
So, the fun's over.

306
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,180
And where did the fire start?

307
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,980
Who's this boy here? Your assistant?

308
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,380
Yes, well, sort of.

309
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,180
The fire started in the hut beyond the right side of the house.

310
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,880
The storeroom with the window where the red horse was placed.

311
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,880
There were traces of kerosene poured on the floor.

312
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,780
So, the arsonist probably poured the kerosene in

313
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,680
from the open window and set fire.

314
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,280
There were a lot of strange footprints by the window of the room

315
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,580
in the foreground of the storeroom.

316
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,580
If we check the footprints carefully,

317
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,980
I'm sure we'll at least get to grab the tail of the arsonist.

318
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,780
Well, the thing is...

319
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,680
What?

320
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,080
Your footprints are mixed up in the footprints there?

321
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,580
I'm actually here

322
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,580
because I was asked to come here by Mrs. Ryoko Morosumi,

323
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,680
the victim who died of the fire.

324
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,180
She asked me to come check on a suspicious person

325
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,280
who was doing something around her house late at night.

326
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,080
But the lady said that it was just her imagination

327
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,580
and told us to leave,

328
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,080
so we were watching her for a while.

329
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,180
Then a strange character who seemed to be a Feng Shui Sensei came by,

330
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,280
so having no other choice, we went into her yard

331
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,180
and looked inside through the window

332
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,280
and saw a pretty bad scene.

333
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,080
Pretty bad scene?

334
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,680
It seems that this man was having an extra-marital affair with Ryoko,

335
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,080
and was ransacking the rooms looking for the video

336
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,580
that was evidence of their affair!

337
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:27,980
That act of yours sounds more than pretty bad to me.

338
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,380
Well, but I guess I'll have to take molds of your shoes later.

339
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,780
Don't tell me you think that we're suspects?

340
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,980
You idiot!

341
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,280
It's to discriminate your footprints with the arsonist's!

342
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,380
I see.

343
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,580
And? Is that man that had an affair with her,

344
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,980
the only one that came by the house?

345
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,480
No, four people came in all.

346
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,080
That man who had the affair and Ryoko's husband.

347
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,080
Ryoko's older sister who seems to be a fortune-teller.

348
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,980
A timid guy who came and left a catalog of his store with her.

349
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:07,080
But the Sensei of Feng Shui and Ryoko's husband are not arsonists.

350
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,080
According to the testimony of the kid next door,

351
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,280
the red horse was placed by the window at exactly 7:30 pm.

352
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,380
The Sensei and her husband went out to drink at about 7:20 pm.

353
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,980
So, the two couldn't have done it.

354
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,180
And we were contemplating for about 5 minutes

355
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,780
whether to follow the two or not.

356
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,280
But at that time, there was no smoke nor fire at all.

357
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,180
The only concern is why those two came back so early

358
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,680
despite having gone drinking.

359
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,080
That's because a neighbor called the husband's cell phone

360
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,080
and told him there was a fire.

361
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,380
Which leaves the older sister who is a fortune-teller and the timid man.

362
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,780
Talking of fortunetelling,

363
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,380
there's a floor in the building of Haido Station

364
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,680
where fortune-tellers gather.

365
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,180
Then, the lady may be there.

366
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,680
-Let's go! -What? Yeah.

367
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,780
What? Ryoko died?

368
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,380
Are you serious?

369
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,780
Yes.

370
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,880
What a stupid child.

371
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,480
I warned her time and again to be careful

372
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,080
because I saw signs of disaster by fire in her!

373
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,980
Our father's funeral is not finished yet,

374
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,080
still why is everybody crossing over like this?

375
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,380
If you will excuse me asking,

376
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,780
where were you at around 7:30 pm?

377
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,080
I was here!

378
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,780
Right?

379
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,880
Yes. We are all under contract

380
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,280
to start fortune-telling from 7:30 pm.

381
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,980
I'm so sorry.

382
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,780
The only one left is the timid man.

383
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:57,080
Do you remember any characteristics of that man?

384
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,780
Well, his height was about 160 centimeters,

385
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,180
and he was wearing round glasses. He seemed to be in his forties.

386
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,880
I think he's an antique shop owner or something.

387
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,380
Since he was going around passing out catalogs,

388
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,980
I think his shop is somewhere nearby.

389
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:17,380
Mr. Yuminaga, does it ring a bell?

390
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,580
No.

391
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,180
It can't be.

392
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,280
He couldn't have.

393
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,120
Next Conan's Hint:

394
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,700
"Guan Yu"
