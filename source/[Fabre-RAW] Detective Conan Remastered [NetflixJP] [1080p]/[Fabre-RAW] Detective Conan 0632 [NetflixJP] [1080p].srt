You imbecile who blasphemies the passage of time,

3
00:00:08,914 --> 00:00:10,614
as punishment for this,

4
00:00:10,614 --> 00:00:13,993
I shall stop your time with my invisible sword

at the exact time that you were born into this world.

Wait.

8
00:00:21,114 --> 00:00:24,414
This is blackmail of forewarning of the intent of murder.

9
00:00:24,414 --> 00:00:25,714
Yes.

"Hoshina Family Butler" -when Mrs. Hoshina's birthday approaches,

12
00:00:29,214 --> 00:00:31,014
it's been sent here.

13
00:00:31,014 --> 00:00:33,714
That letter with no sender's name on it.

14
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:36,314
But despite it coming from two years ago,

15
00:00:36,314 --> 00:00:37,614
that is, last year as well as the year before last,

16
00:00:37,614 --> 00:00:40,019
Mrs. Hoshina is fine, isn't she?

17
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:40,914
Yes.

18
00:00:40,914 --> 00:00:44,714
Her birthday went well with nothing bad happening.

19
00:00:44,714 --> 00:00:50,614
However, since she tells the guests about the letter,

20
00:00:50,614 --> 00:00:53,514
the number of guests attending the party

21
00:00:53,514 --> 00:00:55,214
keep decreasing year after year.

22
00:00:55,214 --> 00:00:57,614
Therefore, you want me, Kogoro Mouri

23
00:00:57,614 --> 00:01:02,041
to find out who the sender of that letter is?

24
00:01:02,214 --> 00:01:03,314
Yes, sir!

25
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:07,214
So, we would like you to come to Mrs. Hoshina's 50th birthday party

26
00:01:07,214 --> 00:01:11,314
and serve as her bodyguard.

27
00:01:11,314 --> 00:01:13,614
A middle-aged lady in her fifties?

28
00:01:13,614 --> 00:01:17,614
No, I'd like to decline the bodyguard part.

29
00:01:17,614 --> 00:01:21,314
We were planning to pay you about this much.

30
00:01:26,814 --> 00:01:29,214
I'll accept the work!

31
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,114
Thank you so very much.

32
00:01:31,114 --> 00:01:32,071
So,

33
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:36,514
what does blasphemy the passage of time mean?

34
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:37,814
Who knows?

35
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:41,314
Maybe it means somebody is going against time to the point of corruption?

36
00:01:41,314 --> 00:01:46,414
If so, is that lady really not punctual or something?

37
00:01:46,414 --> 00:01:48,087
No.

38
00:01:48,087 --> 00:01:49,614
Well...

39
00:01:49,614 --> 00:01:51,614
it's completely the other way around.

40
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,414
Like the fog clears.

41
00:01:56,414 --> 00:01:58,614
Let's see through love and crime as well.

42
00:01:58,614 --> 00:02:00,099
A blackmail warning that time will be stopped is delivered.

43
00:02:00,314 --> 00:02:02,514
Fear sweeps through the birthday party.

44
00:02:02,514 --> 00:02:04,103

2 minutes and 17 seconds late.

49
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:05,469
You promised to come at 14:30, didn't you, Detective Mouri?

50
00:04:05,469 --> 00:04:06,769
Well...

51
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:09,969
it was quite a walk from the garage to here

52
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:12,231
and moreover, it was also raining.

Yes, ma'am! I'll have them fix it immediately!

58

I see.

67
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:54,669
No, they're just like humans.

68
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,275
Unless you perform maintenance on them sometimes

69
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:59,269
like people go to get a physical exam,

70
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:01,969
they will rust and soon start malfunctioning.

74
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:09,769
the cogwheels wear out

75

and the springs also gradually become weak.

76
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:15,669
Who are they?

77
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:18,569
Mr. Karube who designed this building

78
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,569
and Ms. Suou who was in charge of interior decorating.

79
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:23,069
And he's Mr. Furugaki who made the grand clock

80
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:26,669
that is here in this building.

81

They're all guests who were invited to tonight's party.

82

I just came to check on the grand clock.

83
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:38,317
I just happened to be at your birthday party while I was at it.

84
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:41,369
Sorry, but I'm helping myself in.

85
00:05:41,369 --> 00:05:43,169
I gave my word to an old friend

86
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:44,869
that I would take care of that grand clock

87
00:05:44,869 --> 00:05:48,327
as long as I'm alive, you see.

88
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:50,329
An old friend?

89
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:53,169
A clock technician that was hired here before.

90
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:55,069
He was a very outstandingly skilled

91
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:57,369
and until he died of an accident four years ago,

92
00:05:57,369 --> 00:06:01,469
he was in charge of almost all the clocks in this building.

93
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:04,369
If I remember correctly, was he your older brother?

94
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:05,469
Yes!

95
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:06,769
I got to do the interior here

96
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:09,269
because he introduced me here.

97
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:11,669
Oh, that's right, ma'am!

98
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:14,353
I found a really nice carpet,

99
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:16,769
but would you like to see a sample of it?

100
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:19,069
-Later then. -Yes, ma'am!

101
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:20,359
Well,

102
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:22,869
shall we all go inside instead of standing here talking.

103
00:06:22,869 --> 00:06:25,769
I shall keep your umbrellas for you.

104
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:27,069
Thank you.

105
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:28,669
Sure.

106
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:31,069
-Thank you. -No problem.

107
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:32,769
Not me,

108
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:34,169
because it's a folding umbrella.

109
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:35,269
I see.

110
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,375
Here you go.

111
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,869
I shall take it for you.

112
00:06:38,869 --> 00:06:40,069
But,

113
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:42,669
talk about a huge number of clocks!

114
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,769
Really.

115
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:47,769
Did you buy all this, Mrs. Hoshina?

116
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:48,869
Yes.

117
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:50,389
My late husband who died of an illness last year,

118
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:52,969
used to always complain about them

119
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:56,395
saying, "I feel like I married clocks".

120
00:06:56,395 --> 00:07:00,969
Well, it's true that I'm entranced by clocks,

121
00:07:00,969 --> 00:07:03,569
the cute tick-tocking sound

122
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:07,569
and the sound that it plays when the long hand faces the top of the clock.

123
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:15,869
It's true

124
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:18,417
that it sure is grand when they start sounding altogether.

125
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:19,769
True!

126
00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:22,421
It's lively and almost like being at an amusement park!

127
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:24,423
-Mr. Oume. -Yes, ma'am?

128
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:27,669
One of the clocks is 0.5 seconds late!

129
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:30,169
What's going on?

130
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:31,669
I'm sorry!

131
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:33,369
I'll have it fixed immediately!

132
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,669
Then, go and tell him

133
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:37,369
just in case that unless all the clocks

134
00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:41,469
sound in unison at 6:00 p.m. sharp, the time I was born,

135
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:43,569
he's fired!

136
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:45,169
I understand!

137
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:52,169
Nobody can adjust the clocks like your older brother did, after all.

138
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:57,469
I hired three people already to take his place after he passed away,

139
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:01,969
and yet there are one or two clocks that are late every week.

140
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:05,969
But not so for that large clock that comes with the building.

141
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:09,369
It's only been late a number of times during the past 10 years.

142
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:13,269
Well, the very one who made it comes every year to tune it up

143
00:08:13,269 --> 00:08:14,969
so I guess it's only natural, but...

144
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:22,481
Fantastic!

145
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:26,485
This sure is quite overwhelming.

146
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:29,669
I wonder what this door is.

147
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:34,493
You mean the face of this clock

148
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:37,269
is also in view on the backyard side!

149
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,169
It's the man from before.

150
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:45,169
Why is he facing the well and praying?

151
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:48,507
It's because he fell there and died.

152
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:51,669
My older brother, who used to be a clock technician here,

153
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:53,869
was repairing the face of the grand clock

154
00:08:53,869 --> 00:08:55,969
when he was blown by the wind and...

155
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:59,569
The well was here before we rebuilt this place.

156
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:02,521
People are supposed to be here next week and bury it

157
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:04,523
because it's dangerous.

158
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:07,669
Everyone, I guess I'll offer my prayers later too then.

159
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:12,869
I used to be childhood friends with him, you see.

160
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:15,869
Please pray on my behalf too then.

161
00:09:15,869 --> 00:09:18,169
Aren't you going to offer your prayers?

162
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:19,769
You're his baby sister, aren't you?

163
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:24,169
I already offered my prayers this morning.

164
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:26,969
Today is the day he passed away.

165
00:09:26,969 --> 00:09:29,069
He died today?

166
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,169
In an accident on Mrs. Hoshina's birthday?

167
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:32,169
Yes.

168
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:36,069
Well, I'll tell you the details in my room.

169
00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:40,069
I would like Detective Mouri to find out

170
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:43,069
who the sender of that blackmail is too.

171
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:44,169
Yes.

172
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:03,069
It was nothing.

173
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,069
So you mean,

174
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:06,585
she didn't tell you anything about the accident after all?

175
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:07,869
No,

176
00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:10,589
she did tell me about the guy who she has business with

177
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:12,591
that hates her in detail, though.

178
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:15,469
So, the name of the sender of that letter

179
00:10:15,469 --> 00:10:18,369
was "The timekeeper" right?

180
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:19,869
So what?

181
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,669
If so, then...

182
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:25,269
clock technicians are also timekeepers, aren't they?

183
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:28,607
Then, are you saying that the three clock technicians that she's hired

184
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:30,609
are the ones who sent her the blackmail?

185
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:33,069
It's just a possibility.

186
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:35,269
But if so,

187
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:37,269
it seems more likely that Mrs. Hoshina who's very particular about time

188
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,069
would be the timekeeper.

189
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:41,969
Mr. Oume, I think it's about time.

190
00:10:41,969 --> 00:10:43,569
Yes, ma'am.

191
00:10:45,969 --> 00:10:48,627
It's been bothering me from some time ago,

192
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:52,069
but that gold watch... May I have a look at it?

193
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:53,769
Yes, go ahead.

194
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:57,669
Very nice.

195
00:10:57,669 --> 00:11:02,069
Well! The silver flashlight clock was nice too,

196
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:04,643
but this one matches you too, Mrs. Hoshina!

197
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:08,647
This is a one of a kind specially ordered watch

198
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:10,649
that I had a Swiss clock craftsman make for me.

199
00:11:13,469 --> 00:11:16,169
I feel sorry for the watches that are on the verge of rusting

200
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:19,169
being put away in drawers just because of their capricious owner

201
00:11:19,169 --> 00:11:20,659
who wants to purchase them at will.

202
00:11:20,869 --> 00:11:23,369
You need not worry about that.

203
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:26,665
That watch has already been...

204
00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:29,069
I don't have it anymore.

205
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:33,569
It broke, so I disposed of it.

206
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:39,069
-No. -A blackout?

207
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:40,169
Oh, no!

208
00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:52,469
Come on,

209
00:11:52,469 --> 00:11:54,693
she's going to blow out the candles of her birthday cake?

210
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:13,669
Hey, what's going on?

211
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:16,069
What? What's the matter?

212
00:12:22,469 --> 00:12:24,723
Somebody fled from the window?

213
00:12:25,469 --> 00:12:27,369
What was that?

214
00:12:27,369 --> 00:12:28,727
The light!

215
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:30,169
Somebody, turn on the light!

216
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:47,980
I see.

217
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,749
After the candles on the birthday cake were blown out,

218
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:53,280
right after the room became dark,

219
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,280
someone pierced the chest of the owner of this building,

220
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,980
Rukako Hoshina in one blow.

221
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,480
Then within the few seconds before the lights were turned on again,

222
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,763
the culprit fled along with the weapon,

223
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:08,380
going out to the backyard through the window facing it?

224
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,080
Yes, sir. Please take a look at

225
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,773
the blood that splattered on the floor when Mrs. Hoshina was stabbed.

226
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:18,480
Just about here, there are no blood stains, are there?

227
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,380
This is evidence that when the culprit pulled the knife out,

228
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,781
he was standing here

229
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,380
and a lot of blood would've splattered on him.

230
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,180
In spite of this, although the people who are in this room

231
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,789
may have a slight amount of blood on them,

232
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:33,980
no one seems to have been splattered with a huge amount of blood.

233
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,980
Moreover, on the window frames and handrail of the balcony there

234
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,080
are traces of smeared blood.

235
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,980
Inspector, there is no doubt that the culprit

236
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,805
who was splattered with the victim's blood fled out that window.

237
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:48,807
But if so, Mr. Mouri,

238
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:51,980
the thing that's supposed to be here isn't.

239
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,280
This is the second floor.

240
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,780
If it was raining till evening and the ground was wet,

241
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,980
an obvious definite trace of it should be here, shouldn't it?

242
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,823
Traces of the shoe prints of the culprit

243
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:06,580
when he jumped to the ground from this balcony.

244
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,380
That... that's ridiculous!

245
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,680
It's started to rain again.

246
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,380
Are you sure that there are really no footprints of the culprit?

247
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,380
There were none.

248
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,480
Then, maybe the one who sent the blackmail

249
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,280
was the clock technician that died four years ago.

250
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,845
Idiot!

251
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:29,180
How can a dead person send a letter?

252
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,380
But...

253
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,380
the sender was "Timekeeper", right?

254
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,180
A clock technician is also a timekeeper, no?

255
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,580
What's this blackmail thing about?

256
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,880
It seems to have been sent to the madam, the victim,

257
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,863
from about two years ago.

258
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,180
"I shall stop your time with my invisible sword

259
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,680
at the exact time that you were born into this world"

260
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,380
is what it says in the blackmail.

261
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,080
The time that she was born in this world?

262
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,580
It seems that the victim was born at exactly 18:00 today.

263
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,680
And she also seems to have blown out the candles

264
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,880
at 18:00 sharp every year.

265
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,480
And?

266
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,080
Did that clock technician who died four years ago

267
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,180
have a grudge against the victim?

268
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,880
I... I'm not sure of the details,

269
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,280
but it seems that he died of an accident

270
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,480
on the very day of Mrs. Hoshina's birthday.

271
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,380
He didn't die.

272
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,180
He was killed!

273
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,680
By that callous woman who was dominated by time,

274
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,680
as if she were God or something.

275
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,480
It was a very stormy day, back then.

276
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,913
It was so bad

277
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:39,180
that despite the clock technician who is tied to a rope

278
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,380
to keep from falling while fixing the face of the clock

279
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,480
was blown by the wind and fell into the well below.

280
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,925
But wasn't it an accident?

281
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:48,380
Yeah.

282
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,929
It would've been just a plain stupid accident,

283
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,931
if that lady

284
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:55,780
didn't insist on celebrating her birthday party at 18:00 sharp,

285
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,937
and went to look for the clock technician.

286
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:02,180
You mean she went on having the party despite one person missing?

287
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,580
Yes. Therefore, his body ended up being found the following morning.

288
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,180
According to the police,

289
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,280
it seems that he drowned to death

290
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,949
during the time the party was being held,

291
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:12,951
because the well had water in it.

292
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:16,380
Well, if somebody else went out to look for my older brother,

293
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,480
he may have made it alive too, though.

294
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,480
Once the party begins,

295
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,980
I got so busy

296
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,580
that I have no time to go look for anybody.

297
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,980
Inspector.

298
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,980
It sounds like the one who would've most hated the victim

299
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,580
is that clock technician that passed away.

300
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,973
Come on.

301
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:36,975
Just as I thought.

302
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:40,080
The killer is that person's ghost.

303
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,280
That's why we heard no footsteps either.

304
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,280
If so, then the ghost must've had really bad eyes.

305
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,989
Because look at Mrs. Hoshina's necklace.

306
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,980
It shines in the dark.

307
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,680
I'm sure that it has fluorescent paint on it.

308
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,997
So that everyone would know where she is despite it getting dark.

309
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:00,080
Hey!

310
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,980
Who's the one that painted the necklace?

311
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,005
She was letting a lot of people touch it during the party.

312
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:08,480
This party was also one in which she planned

313
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,009
to show her newly bought accessories

314
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,780
to the guests who came, so...

315
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,180
Come to think of it, she was also showing off

316
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,980
and letting everyone touch her gold flashlight watch too.

317
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,280
Then,

318
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,021
isn't the guest with fluorescent paint on his fingers the culprit?

319
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:25,023
Well, if I were the culprit,

320
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:28,280
I would've washed it off in the restroom by now though.

321
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,680
If we could at least specify the suspects down

322
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,031
to a few people with the fingerprints.

323
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,380
I'm sure a lot of people touched it.

324
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,780
How stupid, Pops.

325
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,380
If a ghost touched it,

326
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,041
there would be no detectable fingerprints.

327
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:46,580
Because a ghost can flee like air, with nobody noticing,

328
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,047
floating through the air.

329
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:51,049
You're the one who's stupid!

330
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:53,580
A ghost wouldn't possibly go through the trouble of coming out

331
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,580
to paint fluorescent paint on the necklace, then stab somebody in the dark!

332
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,080
But,

333
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,780
you didn't find any footprints of anyone fleeing, right?

334
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,980
If the culprit's not a ghost,

335
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,980
then, that person deceived everybody into believing that he fled

336
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:08,480
and yet could still be here, right?

337
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,180
I see!

338
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,480
The culprit could've smeared blood

339
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,180
on the railing of the balcony and the window frame beforehand.

340
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,680
To make it look as if he fled outside after opening the window.

341
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,080
Moreover, if the culprit hasn't gone outside yet, it means that

342
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,180
it is highly likely that he still has

343
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,580
the ice pick like long sharp murder weapon that he used to stab

344
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,080
and pierce right through the heart of the victim on him!

345
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,089
Okay, then,

346
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:32,580
let's have each of you come one by one to another room

347
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,680
so that we can interrogate you and do a body check.

348
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:38,180
Hold it!

349
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,380
What about the blood that splattered from the victim to the culprit?

350
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,480
According to you,

351
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,380
the culprit should've gotten a lot of blood on himself, right?

352
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,880
Right,

353
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,680
unless that's cleared,

354
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,580
I don't feel like going through an interrogation or body check either.

355
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,180
Right.

356
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,880
To think that we're not even suspects and are being investigated anyway...

357
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,280
Is rude, don't you think?

358
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,121
Well, it's just to be sure.

359
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,123
I'm sorry,

360
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:07,125
but I've got other things to attend to, so I'm leaving.

361
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,480
-Me too, then. -Same here.

362
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,880
Please wait!

363
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,131
Please wait, everyone!

364
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:14,680
Do you all understand

365
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,680
that a person has died?

366
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,139
We've all come here today

367
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:22,580
to celebrate Mrs. Hoshina's birthday.

368
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:27,145
If the culprit who has done harm to her may be here,

369
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:30,680
isn't it only right to cooperate with the police?

370
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,080
If things are left as is,

371
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,580
the ghost of the clock technician who was my childhood friend

372
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,980
could end up being the killer too.

373
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,780
So you're an architect.

374
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,167
I'm Karube,

375
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,480
the one who designed this building.

376
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,980
Your hands and sleeves have blood on them.

377
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,175
It probably got there

378
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,380
when I ran over to Mrs. Hoshina who fell to the floor.

379
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,980
But there's no blood anywhere else is there?

380
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,183
No.

381
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:07,185
And? Is there anything

382
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:09,780
that you noticed at the time of the crime?

383
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,189
Come to think of it,

384
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:12,380
I think I heard something like cloth

385
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,180
being rubbed against something approaching,

386
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,680
so the culprit could be a woman who is wearing a dress.

387
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,780
By the way, the mouthpiece of your pipe

388
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,203
also looks long and sharp.

389
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:28,680
Is it all right if I check it?

390
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
Sure.

391
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,280
Hey! Enough already!

392
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,380
It's true that the clock technician who died four years ago

393
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,680
was my older brother,

394
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,780
so I have the most motive to be the killer

395
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,880
but that was an unfortunate accident!

396
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,980
I had no grudge against Mrs. Hoshina.

397
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,580
But you were given charge of decorating the interior of this building.

398
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,780
Therefore, you could've rigged this place any way you wanted to.

399
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,235
As to that, Mr. Karube the architect,

400
00:20:57,235 --> 00:20:58,880
as well as Mr. Furugaki who made the grand clock

401
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,480
would also be in the same boat.

402
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,980
But I guess Mr. Furugaki who is quite aged shouldn't be included.

403
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,480
Why not?

404
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,247
The culprit after stabbing Mrs. Hoshina,

405
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:13,251
went pass my left side quite swiftly!

406
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:18,380
So, see, there is a smear of blood on my left arm, isn't there?

407
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:23,680
By the way, the thing that you're wearing in your hair...

408
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,280
This is a hairpin that my older brother bought for me some time ago.

409
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,980
May I check it, please?

410
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,269
You can check it all you want!

411
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,380
But make sure that you give it back to me later!

412
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,273
Yes, ma'am.

413
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,580
I mean it's not a samurai movie or anything,

414
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,281
so I couldn't possibly have a sword or the like on me.

415
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,780
I guess not.

416
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,580
It was you, wasn't it?

417
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,780
The clock technician that made that grand clock.

418
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,580
Yeah, I'm Furugaki.

419
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,680
Your right shoulder

420
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,980
seems to have a bit of splattered blood on it.

421
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,880
It seems that woman was stabbed to my right, so...

422
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,780
It seems to be a pretty old cane,

423
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,680
have you been using it for long?

424
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,780
Yeah. This cane was given to me ten years ago

425
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,580
by the clock technician that we were talking about a while ago.

426
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,180
I could care less,

427
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,080
but I think the culprit is someone who is quite fat.

428
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,880
Just before that woman screamed,

429
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,325
I was pushed by a soft resilient body.

430
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,580
I'm sure the culprit

431
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,080
is someone who was in this large reception back then.

432
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,080
Who on earth is the culprit

433
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,680
who calls himself "The Timekeeper"?

434
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,418
Next Conan's hint:

435
00:24:04,418 --> 00:24:06,262
"Hands of the clock".

436
00:24:06,262 --> 00:24:08,818
Ran, I've figured it out! The culprit is a time stopper!

437
00:24:08,818 --> 00:24:10,620
Stop him from making that deduction.
