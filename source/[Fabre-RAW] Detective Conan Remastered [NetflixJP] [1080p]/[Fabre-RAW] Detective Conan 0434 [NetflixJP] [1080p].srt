1
00:00:02,446 --> 00:00:04,146
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:04,146 --> 00:00:05,846
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:05,846 --> 00:00:07,546
Pets are in trend now.

4
00:00:07,546 --> 00:00:09,046
They wag their tails to their masters,

5
00:00:09,046 --> 00:00:10,746
but show their fangs to bad people!

6
00:00:10,746 --> 00:00:12,146
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:13,846
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,846 --> 00:00:15,846
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:13,115 --> 00:02:19,015
"Good Work, Coeur"

10
00:02:31,115 --> 00:02:33,715
You lose again, Coeur.

11
00:02:33,715 --> 00:02:37,615
Musashi, you've got to learn to let girls win once in a while.

12
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,815
They're cute.

13
00:02:39,815 --> 00:02:43,115
-They play fetch and everything, too? -Yes.

14
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:46,015
"Eisuke Tsutsumi (35)" -Golden Retrievers and Irish Setters

15
00:02:46,015 --> 00:02:49,315
are originally improved breeds of hunting dogs

16
00:02:49,315 --> 00:02:51,615
that were made to accompany hunters who shoot down birds.

17
00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:53,915
"Hiroshi Yanagisawa (34)" -That's why they're good

18
00:02:53,915 --> 00:02:56,115
at searching for and retrieving prey.

19
00:02:56,115 --> 00:03:00,615
"Manami Yanagisawa (30)" -They usually play in the yard of the Tsutsumi's,

20
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:03,815
but we came since we heard that a dog-run was built in Beika Park.

21
00:03:03,815 --> 00:03:06,015
"Misato Tsutsumi (33)" -It's our first time here,

22
00:03:06,015 --> 00:03:07,915
but it's more spacious than we thought it would be.

23
00:03:07,915 --> 00:03:10,715
Musashi and Coeur are delighted, too.

24
00:03:10,715 --> 00:03:12,115
You're right.

25
00:03:12,115 --> 00:03:14,415
It's spacious and feels great.

26
00:03:14,415 --> 00:03:19,615
Are you the Tsutsumi couple with the big house in 4-chome?

27
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:21,115
Yes.

28
00:03:21,115 --> 00:03:23,815
He's the president of a company that lives in that big house.

29
00:03:23,815 --> 00:03:26,615
We just happened to get to know each other when we met walking the dog.

30
00:03:26,615 --> 00:03:28,715
That was five months ago.

31
00:03:28,715 --> 00:03:32,115
Musashi and Coeur are childhood friends.

32
00:03:32,115 --> 00:03:34,315
Is that right?

33
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:36,815
Childhood friends.

34
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:40,615
I wonder where my "Musashi" is wandering around.

35
00:03:40,615 --> 00:03:42,615
Hey, when did I become a dog?

36
00:03:43,915 --> 00:03:45,815
Coeur, what are you eating?

37
00:03:48,215 --> 00:03:50,715
She's always doing things like that.

38
00:03:50,715 --> 00:03:52,115
Musashi does, too.

39
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:54,815
He eats grass, leaves, and even soil.

40
00:03:54,815 --> 00:03:58,615
When we brushed his teeth some time ago, we found clay on his teeth.

41
00:03:58,615 --> 00:04:00,015
Yes.

42
00:04:00,015 --> 00:04:02,215
You mean dogs brush teeth, too?

43
00:04:02,215 --> 00:04:03,815
Yes, after every meal.

44
00:04:03,815 --> 00:04:04,815
After every meal?

45
00:04:04,815 --> 00:04:07,115
They're even better than Pops.

46
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:08,515
Coeur! Musashi!

47
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:11,715
Okay, go for another run!

48
00:04:13,715 --> 00:04:17,315
"Musashi (2)"

49
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:21,315
"Coeur (2)"

50
00:04:29,315 --> 00:04:31,315
It was really fun, wasn't it?

51
00:04:31,315 --> 00:04:35,415
Next time, we should take dad with us too, right?

52
00:04:35,415 --> 00:04:38,915
But Pops prefers horse, doesn't he?

53
00:04:38,915 --> 00:04:41,315
That's true. The ones wearing number bibs.

54
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,715
Yeah!

55
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,415
Hey, be quiet!

56
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:47,215
We have a guest.

57
00:04:47,215 --> 00:04:49,015
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:49,015 --> 00:04:50,615
The dog next door.

59
00:04:50,615 --> 00:04:52,115
What was its name?

60
00:04:52,115 --> 00:04:53,615
"Yoriko Nakatani (41)" -Musashi.

61
00:04:53,615 --> 00:04:55,415
An Irish Setter named Musashi.

62
00:04:57,315 --> 00:04:59,315
Musashi?

63
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:03,815
That dog Musashi barks and growls when he sees you?

64
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:06,815
Yes. He is a very big dog.

65
00:05:06,815 --> 00:05:09,515
I can't help being afraid thinking

66
00:05:09,515 --> 00:05:11,715
that I may be attacked by him one of these days.

67
00:05:11,715 --> 00:05:13,915
Please help me, Mr. Mouri.

68
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:16,315
I'd like to help you if I could.

69
00:05:17,415 --> 00:05:21,015
I moved into the house together with my husband who works in an office

70
00:05:21,015 --> 00:05:24,615
at about the same time that the couple living next door did.

71
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,815
Both houses were originally owned by the same person.

72
00:05:27,815 --> 00:05:32,315
The owner's parents used to live in the house that I live in now.

73
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:33,915
The only thing that separates our house with theirs

74
00:05:33,915 --> 00:05:36,415
is a yard with a low hedge.

75
00:05:37,815 --> 00:05:39,715
That's why even when I'm out in the yard,

76
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,615
I can't help thinking that Musashi's going to jump over the hedge

77
00:05:41,615 --> 00:05:44,315
one of these days and attack me.

78
00:05:44,315 --> 00:05:48,015
Then why don't you change that low hedge to a high fence?

79
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,815
I'd like to!

80
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:52,815
But my husband says he likes it the way it is now.

81
00:05:52,815 --> 00:05:56,215
Even my mother-in-law who doesn't live with us says so.

82
00:05:56,215 --> 00:05:59,515
Musashi is the dog owned by the Tsutsumi couple, right?

83
00:05:59,515 --> 00:06:01,315
What? Do you know him?

84
00:06:01,315 --> 00:06:02,915
Yes, just a bit.

85
00:06:02,915 --> 00:06:05,915
It's true that Musashi is a big dog,

86
00:06:05,915 --> 00:06:07,115
but he's very friendly

87
00:06:07,115 --> 00:06:11,115
and I don't think he would ever bark or growl at people for no reason

88
00:06:11,115 --> 00:06:13,215
much less, attack people.

89
00:06:13,215 --> 00:06:17,415
Maybe you did something to Musashi that he didn't want you to do?

90
00:06:17,415 --> 00:06:19,515
I didn't do anything!

91
00:06:19,515 --> 00:06:20,915
How rude.

92
00:06:20,915 --> 00:06:23,415
Never mind. I won't ask for your help anymore!

93
00:06:23,415 --> 00:06:25,315
If anything ever happens to me,

94
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:27,915
Mr. Mouri, it's all your fault!

95
00:06:27,915 --> 00:06:29,615
Huh? Well...

96
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:33,815
Look at what you did.

97
00:06:33,815 --> 00:06:35,315
I'm sorry,

98
00:06:35,315 --> 00:06:37,915
but Musashi would never do something like that, right?

99
00:06:37,915 --> 00:06:39,815
Yeah.

100
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:43,815
But a little while afterwards, something terrible happens.

101
00:06:47,315 --> 00:06:48,415
Are you all right?

102
00:06:48,415 --> 00:06:50,915
Yes. I'll go inside the house.

103
00:06:50,915 --> 00:06:51,915
Yeah.

104
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,115
What was that?

105
00:06:58,515 --> 00:07:00,315
Dear, it's Musashi!

106
00:07:00,315 --> 00:07:01,315
Yeah.

107
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:06,015
Stay away! Stay away!

108
00:07:11,915 --> 00:07:14,315
Dear, it's the woman next door!

109
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:15,615
Musashi! Stop it, Musashi!

110
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:17,915
Are you all right, Mrs. Nakatani?

111
00:07:17,915 --> 00:07:20,015
My mother-in-law...

112
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:30,415
It can't be...

113
00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:39,515
Dear!

114
00:07:39,515 --> 00:07:40,515
Yeah.

115
00:07:48,215 --> 00:07:49,715
This is Mouri.

116
00:07:51,915 --> 00:07:54,615
What did you just say? Musashi did?

117
00:07:54,615 --> 00:07:55,715
Okay.

118
00:07:55,715 --> 00:07:57,515
Yes, right away.

119
00:07:57,515 --> 00:07:59,915
What about Musashi, dad?

120
00:07:59,915 --> 00:08:02,715
He seems to have attacked Mrs. Nakatani's mother-in-law

121
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,515
and killed her.

122
00:08:04,515 --> 00:08:05,515
What?

123
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,915
All done.

124
00:08:10,915 --> 00:08:14,915
How many days will it take until I'll be able to walk?

125
00:08:14,915 --> 00:08:16,115
Well...

126
00:08:16,115 --> 00:08:17,615
Since you sprained in pretty badly,

127
00:08:17,615 --> 00:08:19,315
I think it'll take at least four or five days.

128
00:08:19,315 --> 00:08:20,715
Four or five days...

129
00:08:20,715 --> 00:08:21,915
Take care.

130
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:22,915
Thank you.

131
00:08:24,215 --> 00:08:26,815
Okay, please give me the details.

132
00:08:26,815 --> 00:08:28,615
Yes. Yesterday at sundown,

133
00:08:28,615 --> 00:08:32,315
my mother-in-law came over while my husband was out.

134
00:08:32,315 --> 00:08:33,715
When I served my mother-in-law coffee,

135
00:08:33,715 --> 00:08:36,415
I mistakenly spilled the coffee on her clothes,

136
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,515
so I had her wear my cardigan.

137
00:08:39,515 --> 00:08:43,515
After that, I remembered that I hadn't taken in the laundry yet,

138
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:45,015
so I went to get them.

139
00:08:47,115 --> 00:08:49,915
But I was careless and ended up

140
00:08:49,915 --> 00:08:53,415
dropping one of my husband's shirts in the yard next door.

141
00:08:53,415 --> 00:08:56,315
Unfortunately, the people next door seemed to be out.

142
00:08:56,315 --> 00:08:57,615
Even if I wanted to go get it myself,

143
00:08:57,615 --> 00:08:59,715
I was afraid of Musashi that I couldn't go.

144
00:08:59,715 --> 00:09:03,315
Then my mother-in-law offered to go pick it up for me.

145
00:09:03,315 --> 00:09:06,215
I stopped her saying that it's dangerous,

146
00:09:06,215 --> 00:09:10,515
but she said she'd be fine because she knew him since he was a puppy.

147
00:09:15,815 --> 00:09:17,415
Musashi,

148
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:18,915
you're such a good boy.

149
00:09:22,915 --> 00:09:24,015
Mother!

150
00:09:29,915 --> 00:09:31,015
Mother!

151
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:46,515
Stay away! Stay away!

152
00:09:46,515 --> 00:09:50,115
Just then, Tsutsumi came to my rescue.

153
00:09:50,115 --> 00:09:51,315
Yes.

154
00:09:51,315 --> 00:09:54,315
We were supposed to come home late tonight because of a party,

155
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:56,715
but my wife didn't feel too well,

156
00:09:56,715 --> 00:09:58,815
so we ended up coming home earlier than expected.

157
00:10:00,715 --> 00:10:03,615
But thanks to that, I've been saved.

158
00:10:03,615 --> 00:10:06,115
May I ask you something?

159
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:08,615
Why do you have that cane?

160
00:10:08,615 --> 00:10:11,515
This is a spare cane that I bought for my mother-in-law

161
00:10:11,515 --> 00:10:13,615
who always uses a cane.

162
00:10:13,615 --> 00:10:15,215
What about those firecrackers?

163
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:18,815
I usually have them on me just in case Musashi attacks.

164
00:10:18,815 --> 00:10:22,215
I heard that dogs don't like the sound of firecrackers.

165
00:10:22,215 --> 00:10:23,315
I'll take those.

166
00:10:24,315 --> 00:10:28,215
Inspector, my mother-in-law was wearing my cardigan

167
00:10:28,215 --> 00:10:30,215
and was mistakenly attacked in my place!

168
00:10:31,915 --> 00:10:36,615
That's why I went to seek help from you back then!

169
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:38,915
But even so...

170
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,415
Kinue was attacked here.

171
00:10:44,415 --> 00:10:46,415
Yoriko fell

172
00:10:46,415 --> 00:10:47,715
just about there.

173
00:10:51,415 --> 00:10:52,515
Blood.

174
00:10:52,515 --> 00:10:55,615
Yoriko wasn't hurt to the point where she was bleeding.

175
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:59,315
Which means that this is Kinue's blood?

176
00:11:01,415 --> 00:11:03,515
But why in a place like this?

177
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:12,579
The results of the autopsy

178
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:17,879
shows that Mrs. Kinue Nakatani died of shock from excessive bleeding.

179
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:19,679
She died of shock.

180
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,279
The teeth marks found on her throat matched those of Musashi, too.

181
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,579
Musashi's saliva was also detected from the wound.

182
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:30,079
Why did Musashi attack Kinue?

183
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,379
He mistook her for Yoriko

184
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:35,879
because Kinue was wearing Yoriko's cardigan.

185
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:38,179
She said so yesterday, didn't she?

186
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:41,479
The dog's sense of smell, although it depends of what kind,

187
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:44,179
is said to be a billion times keener than that of humans.

188
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:46,479
So to tell the smell of Yoriko from the cardigan is...

189
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:49,779
If so, he would've also smelled Kinue, right?

190
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:53,179
If his sense of smell is so keen.

191
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,579
Right.

192
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:57,979
He may have been confused by the smell,

193
00:11:57,979 --> 00:11:59,179
but it's unthinkable to think

194
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:01,679
that he would completely mistake Kinue for Yoriko.

195
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,879
Besides, why did Musashi suddenly bite at Kinue's throat?

196
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:09,079
He would usually most likely bite the hands or the feet, right?

197
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:13,679
And the blood is strange, too.

198
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,879
The blood?

199
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,979
There were a few drops of blood

200
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:20,779
from where Yoriko was on the ground towards the hedge.

201
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:24,679
The forensic officers have verified that the blood was Kinue's.

202
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:28,379
It's most likely that when Yoriko tried to carry Kinue up,

203
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:29,779
blood dripped on her hand

204
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:32,379
and when she shook the cane with her blood stained hand, it splattered.

205
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:36,379
But then, isn't it weird that none of that blood came off near Musashi?

206
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:39,579
Now that he mentioned it, that's true.

207
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:41,779
It's just all child talk of this brat.

208
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:43,779
Don't let him confuse you.

209
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:46,279
Hey, aren't there other points that concern you?

210
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:48,479
Yeah, right.

211
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:51,379
First of all, we've found out that Yoriko and Kinue

212
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:54,579
are usually on bad terms with each other.

213
00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:58,279
The one who testified is Yoriko's sister-in-law.

214
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:00,579
She explained that the reason for this is despite being 40 years old,

215
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:03,479
Yoriko's husband is still very dependent on his mother.

216
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:05,279
It seems that the shirt Yoriko dropped

217
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,779
was something that Kinue had bought for him.

218
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:10,579
So that's why Kinue went to get it herself.

219
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:14,579
Secondly, we found out that Kinue had a weak heart.

220
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:15,979
Her heart was weak?

221
00:13:15,979 --> 00:13:20,479
Thirdly, the Tsutsumi couple living next door told us

222
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:23,979
that when they first moved here, Yoriko was very nice and friendly,

223
00:13:23,979 --> 00:13:25,079
they can't remember when,

224
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:28,279
but she stopped talking to them even if she saw them.

225
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:32,179
Musashi himself used to like Yoriko at the start.

226
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:34,179
But from some time ago,

227
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:38,479
he began barking whenever he sensed Yoriko's presence.

228
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:40,979
By the way, it seems that Yoriko used to be an art teacher

229
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:43,879
at a junior high school.

230
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:46,279
The couple has no children.

231
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,379
But no matter how we look at it,

232
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:50,179
the circumstances point at Musashi having done it.

233
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:51,379
No way!

234
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:54,779
Conan, it isn't Musashi, is it?

235
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:57,079
Speaking of dogs attacking people,

236
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:59,479
remember John's case some time ago?

237
00:14:02,979 --> 00:14:04,979
Listen, it's from your master.

238
00:14:04,979 --> 00:14:08,879
The owner of the dog form a combination of certain words,

239
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,179
trained his dog to attack people.

240
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:17,679
However, in this case,

241
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:21,579
it's hard to believe that the Tsutsumi couple or Yoriko,

242
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:25,179
trained Musashi to attack people.

243
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:28,079
I got it! I've figured it out, Inspector Megure!

244
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,279
This is a thoroughly planned case of homicide!

245
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,779
Homicide?

246
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:35,779
The murderer is none other than Yoriko Nakatani.

247
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:38,779
She must've been looking for an opportunity to kill her mother-in-law

248
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:41,379
since she had been on bad terms with all this time.

249
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:45,879
Moreover, she hated the Tsutsumi couple as well as their pet dog, Musashi.

250
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,379
The couple, too?

251
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:48,679
The reason is most likely envy,

252
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,679
even though the couple is much younger than her and her husband,

253
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:56,579
they'd succeeded in business, have a spacious yard and a large house.

254
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:58,379
I see.

255
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:03,679
So she thought up a way to kill Kinue.

256
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:08,779
First, she buys the same kind of cane that Kinue usually uses.

257
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:10,879
And while the Tsutsumi couple are out,

258
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:13,479
she probably poked Musashi through the hedge or something

259
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,779
and implanted enmity for her within him.

260
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:21,379
And when she did so, she also popped firecrackers and scared him.

261
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:27,679
Last night, after making sure that the Tsutsumi couple were out,

262
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,179
she called her mother-in-law, deliberately spilled coffee on her,

263
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:34,679
as an excuse to make Kinue wear the cardigan that had her smell on.

264
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:39,279
And for some reason, she decides to take in the laundry at night,

265
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,279
drops her husband's favourite shirt

266
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:45,279
and make it so that Kinue goes out to get it.

267
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:51,179
Musashi realizes that Kinue had entered his territory

268
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:54,779
and sees the cane that he hates.

269
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:58,379
On top of that, he smells someone that he hates,

270
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:03,279
so he must've growled threatening them not to come any closer.

271
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,379
Then Yoriko came up from behind.

272
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:19,479
Yoriko took advantage of the sense of sight, smell and sound of the dog

273
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:23,079
to commit a cleverly schemed and daring crime.

274
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:25,579
Kinue who had a weak heart, could've had a heart attack,

275
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:30,479
just by being frightened at Musashi attacking her.

276
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:33,979
But Musashi bit her in the throat,

277
00:16:33,979 --> 00:16:37,779
causing excessive bleeding causing death by shock.

278
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:41,079
It turned out better than you expected.

279
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:43,779
Is it true, Yoriko?

280
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:46,079
Famed detective, my foot.

281
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:50,179
I hope you have proof for saying all you did.

282
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:52,579
I will show you proof now.

283
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:56,879
But before that, could you please lend me the clothes you're wearing now?

284
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:58,079
That cane, too.

285
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:09,979
Listen.

286
00:17:09,979 --> 00:17:12,179
Pull the leash and stop Musashi

287
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,679
the instant Officer Sato pops the firecracker

288
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:16,579
and when he's about to pounce onto her.

289
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:19,079
Yes, sir. I understand.

290
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,879
Officer Takagi, I'll leave it to you.

291
00:17:21,879 --> 00:17:24,879
Officer Sato, even if I have to risk my own life, I will.

292
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:30,979
If Musashi gets excited at the sound of the firecracker,

293
00:17:30,979 --> 00:17:32,779
then he's the one that did it.

294
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:33,979
Or it could be that...

295
00:17:37,879 --> 00:17:39,379
Okay! Let him go!

296
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,379
Okay, come.

297
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,079
Good boy, good boy.

298
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,279
It can't be!

299
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:04,379
See? It's just as I said, isn't it?

300
00:18:09,879 --> 00:18:11,279
I see.

301
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:14,179
I heard about the case on the news and was worried.

302
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:16,279
Is Musashi still at the police station?

303
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:19,879
Yes. Kinue trespassed on private property,

304
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:24,379
so I don't think the Tsutsumi couple or Musashi will be held responsible.

305
00:18:24,379 --> 00:18:29,579
I'll have to gather more info to get to the truth.

306
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:33,179
Why don't we go to the Tsutsumi's residence from now?

307
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,879
Okay. Sounds good.

308
00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:42,079
Huh? You're going to move?

309
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,279
Yeah.

310
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:45,279
Although we won't be punished by law,

311
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,179
the fact that Musashi attacked Kinue and killed her will not disappear.

312
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:51,279
We can't live here anymore.

313
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:52,579
Is that so?

314
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,679
What did you find this time?

315
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:58,079
What's this?

316
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,079
That's...

317
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:01,079
Musashi's toothbrush.

318
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,979
Toothbrush?

319
00:19:02,979 --> 00:19:07,479
When we brushed his teeth some time ago, we found clay on his teeth.

320
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,079
By the way, it seems that Yoriko used to be an art teacher

321
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,079
at a junior high school.

322
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:14,079
Don't tell me that...

323
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,879
Clay. If so...

324
00:19:42,379 --> 00:19:48,779
Our deduction that you lured Musashi into attacking Kinue was wrong.

325
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:50,879
Musashi didn't do anything.

326
00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:54,179
You're the one who killed Kinue.

327
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:57,379
Just what do you mean by "I'm the one", Inspector Megure?

328
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:06,479
You made Musashi bite clay and took the mold of his teeth

329
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:08,779
and made a mold of his teeth using plaster.

330
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:12,679
You used the experience you had when you used to be an art teacher.

331
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:16,179
That night, you pushed Kinue who went out to the yard next door

332
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:19,279
to pick up the shirt that you deliberately dropped.

333
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,079
Musashi was severely agitated by the violence he'd witnessed

334
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,879
and began to bark loudly.

335
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:29,979
You made Musashi pull away using the firecrackers

336
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,679
and meant to go back into the house during that time,

337
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:35,479
but you sprained your ankle.

338
00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:40,679
After that, you told the Tsutsumi couple that Kinue was attacked.

339
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:42,279
And while the Tsutsumi couple

340
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:45,179
were distracted with their attention on Kinue,

341
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,479
you threw the mold of Musashi's teeth towards the yard of your house.

342
00:20:51,879 --> 00:20:55,879
This teeth mold made of plaster solved everything.

343
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,279
Conan is the one who found it.

344
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:59,379
That's not true.

345
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:01,679
Coeur's the one who found it.

346
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,279
Musashi's saliva was on Kinue's wound

347
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:07,179
because dogs have a habit of licking themselves and others of their pack

348
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:09,879
in order to heal the wound, right?

349
00:21:09,879 --> 00:21:13,479
She took advantage of this.

350
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:16,279
Do you have anything to say to it?

351
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:19,379
That woman...

352
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:23,279
She used to look next door and always sigh and say each time she came here,

353
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:26,579
that one should choose a bride carefully.

354
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:27,579
Just because of something like that?

355
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:29,179
Yes, just something like that!

356
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:32,079
Since you forever clung to your mother despite your age,

357
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:34,979
you would probably never understand!

358
00:21:34,979 --> 00:21:38,079
If only I didn't sprain my leg...

359
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:40,179
Your leg will heal in time!

360
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:41,779
But before that,

361
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:44,579
I think you have something that you should fix, isn't there?

362
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:21,979
Hey, I've been wondering from before.

363
00:23:21,979 --> 00:23:25,279
The name Coeur doesn't sound too feminine.

364
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,779
Could it be that it's not English?

365
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:30,679
Yes. It's Coeur in French.

366
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:32,479
I had no idea.

367
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:36,179
It means "heart" in French.

368
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:37,579
Heart.

369
00:23:37,579 --> 00:23:42,679
I'm sure she had the heart of wanting to save her childhood friend.

370
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:44,979
I wonder if my Musashi feels that way about me?

371
00:23:44,979 --> 00:23:48,079
I'm sure he does.

372
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:50,279
Nope, he doesn't.

373
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:54,579
Because when there's a case, his heart's nowhere near here.

374
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:58,279
You've got me there.

375
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:59,879
Conan, did you say something?

376
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,080
Next Conan's Hint:

377
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,080
"Hay fever"

378
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,980
Officer Sato, do you have hay fever?

379
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,260
Yes.

380
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,260
Then, so do I.
