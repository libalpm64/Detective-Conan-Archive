00:00:02,592 --> 00:00:05,292
Dear Mr. Kogoro Mouri,

2
00:00:05,292 --> 00:00:06,592
I respect you as a famed detective

3
00:00:06,592 --> 00:00:09,192
and would like to ask you something.

4
00:00:09,192 --> 00:00:13,192
11 years ago, I was indicted for murder.

5
00:00:13,192 --> 00:00:15,192
Please prove my innocence

6
00:00:15,192 --> 00:00:18,492
and clear my name for me with your great deduction.

7
00:00:18,492 --> 00:00:22,001
I will talk the details over with you on December 19th,

8
00:00:22,192 --> 00:00:23,692
at Kora Inn in Kuchibashi Village,

9
00:00:23,692 --> 00:00:27,392
Gunma prefecture, near the site the murder.

10
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,592
Mika Tatezato.

11
00:00:29,592 --> 00:00:34,013
I mean, is that person trying to meet with you, dad,

12
00:00:34,192 --> 00:00:36,392
while that person is still on the run as a murderer?

13
00:00:36,392 --> 00:00:38,892
Yeah. It could be.

14
00:00:38,892 --> 00:00:40,992
It could be?

15
00:00:40,992 --> 00:00:42,992
Is it really going to be alright for you to see her?

16
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:46,592
Right! Let's contact the police first.

17
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,027
I thought so too.

18
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:50,892
So I had Yamamura of Gunma prefectural police check for me,

19
00:00:50,892 --> 00:00:56,035
but was told that no murder committed near that inn 11 years ago.

20
00:00:56,192 --> 00:01:00,039
There seems to be no fugitive by the name Mika Tatezato either.

21
00:01:01,592 --> 00:01:07,092
Yamamura said he thinks it's a bad prank.

22
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:09,092
Then why'd you come?

23
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:11,492
I had no other choice, did I?

24
00:01:11,492 --> 00:01:14,053
Since I ate using the cash that was in the envelope

25
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:16,055
together with the letter.

26
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:18,057
You use it to eat...

27
00:01:18,292 --> 00:01:20,992
Don't tell me, you mean yesterday's Chinese cuisine?

28
00:01:20,992 --> 00:01:22,392
Come to think of it,

29
00:01:22,392 --> 00:01:27,092
Pops was ordering a whole lot of expensive food and drinks.

30
00:01:27,092 --> 00:01:28,067
Well...

31
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:31,492
I'm just going to go check if it's really a prank or not!

32
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:53,892
Brooding over passing seasons

33
00:01:53,892 --> 00:01:55,692
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

34
00:01:55,692 --> 00:01:57,592
Today's the 600th time that we've been aired on TV.

35
00:01:57,592 --> 00:01:59,892
The green legend, curse of the water sprite?

36
00:01:59,892 --> 00:02:01,492
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:02:01,492 --> 00:02:03,292
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:05,492
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

39
00:03:29,923 --> 00:03:35,223
"The Water Sprite's Dream (Part 1)"

40
00:03:49,523 --> 00:03:50,923
You idiot!

41
00:03:50,923 --> 00:03:54,213
-Watch out! -I'm sorry!

42
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:57,023
Are you people by chance going to the Kora Inn?

43
00:03:57,023 --> 00:04:00,223
Yes! That's right.

44
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:02,223
If so, could you give me a lift?

45
00:04:02,223 --> 00:04:04,823
I've got reservations at that inn too today.

46
00:04:06,223 --> 00:04:08,823
Yeah, I don't mind.

47
00:04:08,823 --> 00:04:10,823
Thank you very much.

48
00:04:14,623 --> 00:04:17,123
Well, you're a life-saver!

49
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:19,923
I thought of walking from the station,

50
00:04:19,923 --> 00:04:21,923
but I ran out of breath part way.

51
00:04:21,923 --> 00:04:24,523
Could you by chance be Mr. Tatezato?

52
00:04:24,523 --> 00:04:29,223
"Rokuro Tokubi (42)" -No. My name is Rokuro Tokubi.

53
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:38,257
But, I think it's pretty far from the station.

54
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:43,423
Yes. I used to be an elementary school teacher near here before,

55
00:04:43,423 --> 00:04:47,323
and used to like to walk around here looking at the scenery.

56
00:04:47,323 --> 00:04:50,823
But, I don't seem to be able to walk like I did before.

57
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,623
Well, but that school is closed now

58
00:04:53,623 --> 00:04:55,323
and I quit my job as a teacher.

59
00:04:55,323 --> 00:04:57,523
Now, I'm an unknown artist.

60
00:04:57,523 --> 00:04:58,277
That's right!

61
00:04:58,523 --> 00:05:00,279
Since I've already got you to give me a lift,

62
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:04,023
could I ask you to stop over at a grave site?

63
00:05:04,023 --> 00:05:06,285
What? Grave site?

64
00:05:09,023 --> 00:05:10,723
I see...

65
00:05:10,723 --> 00:05:13,823
A child got drifted away and drowned?

66
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:14,823
Yes.

67
00:05:14,823 --> 00:05:18,297
The boy who died was named Tatsuhiko Numayama,

68
00:05:18,523 --> 00:05:22,301
and he seems to have drifted all the way to the reservoir downstream.

69
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:24,323
Does that have something to do with a murder

70
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:27,023
that was committed 11 years ago?

71
00:05:27,023 --> 00:05:29,723
It wasn't murder, it was an accident!

72
00:05:29,723 --> 00:05:32,823
He seems to have been playing at the river despite heavy rainfall

73
00:05:32,823 --> 00:05:34,723
and seems to have been taken away by the current.

74
00:05:34,723 --> 00:05:37,723
But, I think that was about 10 years ago.

75
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,723
Mr. Tokubi.

76
00:05:41,723 --> 00:05:45,323
It's you, Araiwa, right?

77
00:05:45,323 --> 00:05:48,023
Did you come to pay homage to the grave too?

78
00:05:48,023 --> 00:05:49,023
Yes.

79
00:05:49,023 --> 00:05:52,923
"Kazuki Araiwa (21)" -Today is Tatsuhiko's memorial day.

80
00:05:52,923 --> 00:05:56,323
But, this sure is a shabby tombstone.

81
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:59,523
No, the real tomb is elsewhere.

82
00:05:59,523 --> 00:06:02,723
This is a tombstone that the classmates

83
00:06:02,723 --> 00:06:05,523
made for Tatsuhiko when he passed away.

84
00:06:05,523 --> 00:06:09,823
In place of his bones, we buried things in memory of him.

85
00:06:09,823 --> 00:06:14,123
Of course, I went to pay homage to his real grave too.

86
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:17,423
But, why here?

87
00:06:17,423 --> 00:06:23,023
Because he died taken away by the current of this river in back.

88
00:06:23,023 --> 00:06:25,723
On this day, 11 years ago.

89
00:06:25,723 --> 00:06:28,923
11... 11 years ago?

90
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:32,371
This have to do with the murder written in the letter, after all?

91
00:06:32,623 --> 00:06:34,373
Letter?

92
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:37,623
How did you know that he was taken by the current of this river?

93
00:06:37,623 --> 00:06:41,723
He was found in the reservoir downstream, right?

94
00:06:41,723 --> 00:06:43,823
His shoe was found.

95
00:06:43,823 --> 00:06:46,385
Tatsuhiko's shoe that was stuck between the rocks

96
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:48,387
at the bottom of the river.

97
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:52,391
So, the police concluded that Tatsuhiko,

98
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:54,393
who was playing at the river, got his foot stuck.

99
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,395
In the meantime, it began to rain harder

100
00:06:56,395 --> 00:07:01,423
and he was carried away in a flash flood.

101
00:07:01,423 --> 00:07:05,423
But to play at the river in December...

102
00:07:05,423 --> 00:07:10,409
I wonder about where in the river that shoe was found.

103
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:13,723
Over there, where the rock is sticking out.

104
00:07:13,723 --> 00:07:15,723
Just about here I think it was.

105
00:07:15,723 --> 00:07:18,723
Is that shoe in some place right now?

106
00:07:18,723 --> 00:07:21,123
About that, we buried it in the grave.

107
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:23,623
I think you can take a look at it if you dig it out.

108
00:07:27,923 --> 00:07:30,423
-Hey! -No!

109
00:07:30,423 --> 00:07:31,623
We're fine!

110
00:07:31,623 --> 00:07:33,423
Because it's shallow.

111
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:40,723
My painting tools somehow made it okay,

112
00:07:40,723 --> 00:07:43,423
but I can't use this sketchbook anymore.

113
00:07:45,623 --> 00:07:47,923
These incense are useless too.

114
00:07:47,923 --> 00:07:51,023
As for me, my bag is made of vinyl

115
00:07:51,023 --> 00:07:53,623
so almost nothing got wet.

116
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:56,455
The cap of my PET bottle was closed tightly,

117
00:07:56,455 --> 00:07:58,223
and my change of clothes and pillow are also fine.

118
00:07:58,223 --> 00:07:59,923
Hey!

119
00:07:59,923 --> 00:08:02,461
Just what're you guys doing?

120
00:08:04,623 --> 00:08:08,467
You guys look familiar?

121
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:10,469
I'm Tatsuhiko's friend

122
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,923
and I came to pay homage to his grave.

123
00:08:12,923 --> 00:08:14,473
Pay homage to his grave?

124
00:08:14,723 --> 00:08:17,123
What the heck's this grave worth?

125
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:22,923
"Banzo Numayama (51)" -Listen! My son died 11 years ago!

126
00:08:22,923 --> 00:08:25,023
Forget it already!

127
00:08:26,823 --> 00:08:28,123
Son?

128
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:34,023
So, he's the late Tatsuhiko's father.

129
00:08:34,023 --> 00:08:37,123
Yes. He's the owner of the inn

130
00:08:37,123 --> 00:08:38,823
that we're headed for as well.

131
00:08:38,823 --> 00:08:39,923
-What? -What?

132
00:08:39,923 --> 00:08:44,023
But, why was the owner of the inn in a place like that?

133
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,505
I think he was on guard watching.

134
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:49,223
-What? -On guard watching?

135
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:52,511
That inn is on a highland.

136
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:54,513
And it seems if you use binoculars

137
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:58,523
and look out the small window of the attic, you get a panoramic view.

138
00:08:58,523 --> 00:09:01,323
"Kora Inn" -What? She's not here?

139
00:09:01,323 --> 00:09:05,523
Are you sure that a person named Mika Tatezato is not staying here?

140
00:09:05,523 --> 00:09:09,223
I'm supposed to meet that person here early tomorrow morning.

141
00:09:09,223 --> 00:09:11,223
There's no such person...

142
00:09:11,223 --> 00:09:15,423
How about about a murder case that occurred 11 years ago?

143
00:09:15,423 --> 00:09:17,623
-I've no idea... -You've no idea?

144
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:20,523
There was.

145
00:09:20,523 --> 00:09:22,223
"Bosuke Nohira (45)" -But the story is

146
00:09:22,223 --> 00:09:25,623
that the culprit is a water sprite, though.

147
00:09:25,623 --> 00:09:27,623
Water sprite?

148
00:09:27,623 --> 00:09:30,223
Yes.

149
00:09:30,223 --> 00:09:34,023
In this area, deep-rooted legends of the water sprite remain.

150
00:09:35,323 --> 00:09:36,555
About 12 to 13 years ago,

151
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:39,823
people saying they saw water sprites appeared,

152
00:09:39,823 --> 00:09:43,723
TV crews and magazine reporters came here for the scoop.

153
00:09:43,723 --> 00:09:46,565
Immediately afterwards, a kid drowned in the river.

154
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:49,923
And people began clamouring that it was the work of a water sprite.

155
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:53,823
But after that, there were no more eye-witness reports of water sprites

156
00:09:53,823 --> 00:09:57,523
and virtually no one comes to this shabby place anymore.

157
00:09:57,523 --> 00:10:00,323
Wait!

158
00:10:00,323 --> 00:10:03,923
The name on this letter Mika Tatezato.

159
00:10:03,923 --> 00:10:05,623
If you split the kanji characters "tate", "zato",

160
00:10:05,623 --> 00:10:09,623
"mi", "ka" and rearrange them...

161
00:10:09,623 --> 00:10:11,223
"Water Sprite"

162
00:10:11,223 --> 00:10:14,593
Wouldn't it form the kanji character for "water sprite"?

163
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,595
I'm sure that's what it is!

164
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:19,223
The water sprite called dad,

165
00:10:19,223 --> 00:10:21,823
the detective here to prove its innocence and clear its name!

166
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,823
Everyone is being thrown

167
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,605
into panic by senseless superstition!

168
00:10:26,823 --> 00:10:30,609
If you insist on continuing to talk about non-existent ghosts,

169
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:32,611
I'm kicking you out of this inn!

170
00:10:35,423 --> 00:10:37,623
Are you really sure?

171
00:10:37,623 --> 00:10:40,323
That you dropped your cell phone near that river.

172
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:43,623
When we were at the river I got mail from Sonoko

173
00:10:43,623 --> 00:10:44,623
and I was texting her back.

174
00:10:44,823 --> 00:10:47,323
That's when the two men fell into the river,

175
00:10:47,323 --> 00:10:50,223
I probably dropped it then...

176
00:10:50,223 --> 00:10:53,123
Couldn't we do this tomorrow?

177
00:10:53,123 --> 00:10:56,223
I thought so too, but Conan...

178
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:57,723
If the battery of the cell phone dies,

179
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:00,623
we won't be able to hear the ring tone

180
00:11:00,623 --> 00:11:03,223
and won't be able to locate it, right?

181
00:11:05,523 --> 00:11:08,223
I think it was around here.

182
00:11:08,223 --> 00:11:10,223
Let's split up and look for it!

183
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:15,623
-Hey! Are you calling? -Yep!

184
00:11:21,823 --> 00:11:23,123
I found it!

185
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:32,671
What? What's that noise?

186
00:11:42,123 --> 00:11:43,723
Hey, what's wrong?

187
00:11:43,723 --> 00:11:46,223
Water sprite!

188
00:11:46,223 --> 00:11:48,223
What? Water sprite?

189
00:11:51,123 --> 00:11:54,123
There's no such thing around!

190
00:11:54,123 --> 00:11:56,023
I saw one a while ago!

191
00:11:56,023 --> 00:11:59,723
It stood up in the river and looked this way.

192
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:05,323
You found your cell phone!

193
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:06,723
Yes.

194
00:12:11,323 --> 00:12:12,723
It's started raining!

195
00:12:12,723 --> 00:12:14,023
Let's go back.

196
00:12:14,023 --> 00:12:15,923
I guess so.

197
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:22,423
"Kora Inn"

198
00:12:22,423 --> 00:12:25,623
What? You saw the water sprite?

199
00:12:25,623 --> 00:12:30,223
Yes. My daughter says that it was there at that river last night.

200
00:12:30,223 --> 00:12:34,223
Well, I think she mistook a branch or something for it though.

201
00:12:34,223 --> 00:12:37,423
I tell you it was really there!

202
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,523
Maybe that was a ghost...

203
00:12:41,523 --> 00:12:42,523
Ghost?

204
00:12:42,523 --> 00:12:46,123
I think you should cut out the talk about the water sprite.

205
00:12:46,123 --> 00:12:49,523
Otherwise, that man's going to come shouting again.

206
00:12:51,223 --> 00:12:52,751
Here he comes!

207
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:55,623
Bad news!

208
00:12:55,623 --> 00:12:57,323
The owner...

209
00:12:57,323 --> 00:12:58,323
-What? -What?

210
00:12:59,423 --> 00:13:04,023
The dead body was lying on the floor of the dimly lit attic.

211
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:06,765
As if possessed by the water sprite,

212
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:09,823
and dragged to the bottom of the reservoir,

213
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:13,623
covered in a rancid liquid that stung our noses.

214
00:13:13,623 --> 00:13:17,623
Clenching his deceased son's belongings to his chest.

215
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,670
"Kora Inn" -What?

216
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,070
Drowned to death?

217
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,570
Yes, that's what the coroner said.

218
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,791
And that judging from the water that was on the victim

219
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,793
as well as the type of water that was found in his body,

220
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:38,370
he says that somebody must've drowned him

221
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:42,170
in a contaminated swamp or something somewhere,

222
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,803
and later brought over here!

223
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:47,370
Come to think of it, he did smell of stench.

224
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,170
-Yeah. -But,

225
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,811
it seems as if the culprit brought that smelly water over here, though.

226
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:54,813
-What? -What?

227
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:57,570
See! This water dipper...

228
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,570
Smells the same!

229
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:02,370
I see.

230
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,270
The culprit scooped smelling water

231
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,825
and poured into this water dipper,

232
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:11,270
then, he sunk Mr. Numayama's face in it and drowned him.

233
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,370
Then, in the end the culprit poured that water over the dead body.

234
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,570
But, I wonder why Mr. Numayama was in a place like this?

235
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,170
It seems to have been a daily routine for him.

236
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,270
The clerk of the inn said that every morning after getting up,

237
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:28,847
he would come here and guard the river from the window,

238
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:30,849
with those binoculars.

239
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,170
But, for what?

240
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,470
I think it's because his son was carried away

241
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,670
by the current of that river and died.

242
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,170
So, he didn't want the same thing that happened again,

243
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,070
so he kept watch over from here.

244
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,470
Let's see...

245
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,670
It's true, it's in view!

246
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,570
But, if he was thinking of his son,

247
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:59,370
he didn't have to kick the tombstone that his friends made for him.

248
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,470
I hear it's not the 1st or 2nd time he's done that.

249
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,570
Maybe there's something.

250
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,970
Near that river.

251
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,670
It seems that he used to walk around that area

252
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,870
after everybody hit the sack.

253
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:18,570
But the only thing there is the tombstone his friends made.

254
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:22,570
By the way, the shoe that is near the dead body

255
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,903
is Tatsuhiko's shoe, right?

256
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,270
But, I thought you said it was buried under his tombstone?

257
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,370
Yeah.

258
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,070
Then, I wonder if the culprit dug it back up?

259
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,913
No, the shoe that was buried was only the right shoe

260
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:37,170
that was stuck between the rocks at the bottom of the river.

261
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,070
That looks like the left shoe, though.

262
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,870
Then maybe it's the shoe that Tatsuhiko was wearing

263
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,170
when he was carried away by the river

264
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:48,270
and found at the reservoir?

265
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,670
So one side of his shoe came off,

266
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,570
but he was found wearing the other side.

267
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,370
No, it seems that the only thing he was wearing

268
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,935
when he was found was his swimming trunks!

269
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:58,937
Only his swimming trunks?

270
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,270
You mean in this cold?

271
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:04,943
So, maybe he was trying to cold-weather swimming or something.

272
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:07,470
I get it! It's that reservoir!

273
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,949
The stink water that was poured over Mr. Numayama,

274
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:13,270
smelled the same as the water of the reservoir

275
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,270
that Tatsuhiko's dead body was found floating in!

276
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:19,770
That reservoir turned into an illegal trash dumping site.

277
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,670
From the stench and eerie sight of it,

278
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,370
it seems that the villagers named it...

279
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,270
The habitat of the water sprite,

280
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,470
Hell Swamp!

281
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,670
Hell... Hell Swamp?

282
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,975
Then... Then, this case has something to do

283
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:40,979
with the water sprite after all?

284
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,870
You know what, Ran.

285
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,370
In this day and age when people are talking of traveling to space,

286
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,670
no such things as water sprites exist!

287
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:54,070
But... last night I...

288
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,370
And? Where is that reservoir?

289
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,770
About 10 kilometers downstream from here.

290
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,003
Then let's have the forensics go over there,

291
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:06,670
and compare the water in the reservoir

292
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:09,870
and the water that was on the dead body!

293
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:13,970
I think you should also check everybody's belongings.

294
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,015
Because if the culprit out that smelly water

295
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:19,670
into this dipper and enters the inn, it'll be conspicuous,

296
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,870
and the smell would catch everyone's attention.

297
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:25,023
I see. In order to bring that water here,

298
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:29,470
it'd have to put it in an airtight container.

299
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,470
Moreover, the stairs that lead to the attic

300
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,370
is behind the restroom.

301
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,370
Pretending to go to the restroom,

302
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:41,039
anyone can enter with ease.

303
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,043
In other words, anybody at this inn,

304
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:47,670
as long as he gets to bring the smelly water here,

305
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,570
could've committed the murder.

306
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,570
Yamamura!

307
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,051
What's the estimated time of death of the victim?

308
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:54,270
Yes, sir!

309
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:59,370
I hear it was between 6:00 to 7:00 this morning!

310
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:04,070
Okay! Check the alibis of everyone at the inn!

311
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,470
I'll go to the rooms of those spending the night here

312
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,570
and check if there are any suspicious containers!

313
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:12,370
Yes, sir!

314
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:15,970
I think that's supposed to be my job.

315
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,077
I mean I wasn't promoted to inspector for nothing, you know.

316
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,370
"Chrysanthemum room"

317
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:24,170
The only airtight containers

318
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,870
that I could keep water in are these.

319
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,087
The big bottle for color ink holds 60 ml.

320
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:32,170
The small bottle holds 15 ml.

321
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:35,470
But both bottles are quite filled to the top with ink.

322
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,095
Even the white container,

323
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:39,097
is filled more than half way with paint,

324
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:42,170
so the only empty bottle would be this water container.

325
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,570
100 ml.

326
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,107
Isn't enough to drown a person.

327
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:50,878
I think so too.

328
00:18:50,878 --> 00:18:54,497
Maybe you have other containers hidden somewhere?

329
00:18:54,497 --> 00:18:56,397
I don't think so!

330
00:18:56,397 --> 00:18:57,997
Yesterday after he fell into the river,

331
00:18:57,997 --> 00:19:01,397
he spread out his belongings and checked them,

332
00:19:01,397 --> 00:19:03,797
but didn't have any containers other than these.

333
00:19:05,297 --> 00:19:07,897
But why do you have so many tools for painting with you?

334
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:11,129
-He's an artist. -Really?

335
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:13,131
He seems to previously have been a teacher

336
00:19:13,297 --> 00:19:16,197
at the elementary school that Tatsuhiko went to, though.

337
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,497
That's why I decided to spend the night here,

338
00:19:18,497 --> 00:19:21,139
since I came to offer incense to Tatsuhiko's Buddhist altar.

339
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:22,197
And?

340
00:19:22,197 --> 00:19:24,897
At the time of the crime this morning between 6:00 and 7:00

341
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,497
where were you and what were you doing?

342
00:19:26,497 --> 00:19:28,597
I was asleep in my room.

343
00:19:28,597 --> 00:19:31,149
Until a person of this inn came

344
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:33,151
to tell me that breakfast was ready.

345
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:36,416
"Cherry Blossom room"

346
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,531
Then, you also came to offer incense to Tatsuhiko's altar?

347
00:19:39,531 --> 00:19:43,161
Yes, sir! I used to come with everybody else in the past

348
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:46,031
but, now, only I do.

349
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:48,731
Then, where and what were you doing

350
00:19:48,731 --> 00:19:50,131
between 6:00 and 7:00 this morning?

351
00:19:50,131 --> 00:19:53,831
I got up at 6:30 am and was taking a bath.

352
00:19:53,831 --> 00:19:56,031
I was all alone, though.

353
00:19:57,631 --> 00:19:58,931
The containers that you can put water inside

354
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:03,181
are these two 500 ml bottles,

355
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:05,183
but one is still unopened

356
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:09,187
and the other one is still more than half filled.

357
00:20:10,631 --> 00:20:12,931
What's this?

358
00:20:12,931 --> 00:20:15,193
That's a water pillow.

359
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:19,197
You put water inside it and inflate it.

360
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:21,731
I can't sleep with any other pillow.

361
00:20:21,731 --> 00:20:24,531
I get it! A water pillow!

362
00:20:24,531 --> 00:20:26,931
You filled this up with the smelly water

363
00:20:26,931 --> 00:20:29,207
from the reservoir and brought it here!

364
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:33,211
As proof of that there's no water in here now!

365
00:20:33,431 --> 00:20:37,531
I drained the water out when I went to take a bath because I'm leaving.

366
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:40,831
I think he's telling the truth.

367
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,731
Because he too, after falling into the river,

368
00:20:42,731 --> 00:20:47,631
he spread his belongings out, but that pillow was deflated flat.

369
00:20:47,631 --> 00:20:52,331
But, he could've secretly gone to get the water, right?

370
00:20:52,331 --> 00:20:55,233
Well, I guess he could.

371
00:20:57,031 --> 00:20:59,231
"Plum room" -A camera, a camera stand,

372
00:20:59,231 --> 00:21:02,031
an IC recorder, and a laptop computer.

373
00:21:02,031 --> 00:21:03,631
Who are you?

374
00:21:03,631 --> 00:21:05,531
A journalist!

375
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:09,247
I pursue ghostly legends that exist in various districts.

376
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:13,031
So, you came here because you heard about the water sprite?

377
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:16,931
Yes, I wasn't able to gather much material though.

378
00:21:16,931 --> 00:21:19,831
But, how unusual.

379
00:21:19,831 --> 00:21:21,259
That you're carrying around a camera

380
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:23,261
that uses film instead of a digital camera.

381
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:26,131
I used to be a cameraman before, that's why.

382
00:21:26,131 --> 00:21:29,267
I just can't come to like digital cameras.

383
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:31,931
Well, with this many film cases

384
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:33,931
I guess you could fill quite an amount of

385
00:21:33,931 --> 00:21:35,831
the water in question.

386
00:21:35,831 --> 00:21:38,231
Hey! Didn't I tell you a while ago

387
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:41,031
that I was talking to the editor in charge all the way

388
00:21:41,031 --> 00:21:43,831
from 6:00 am in the morning till a little past 7:00 am!

389
00:21:43,831 --> 00:21:45,283
Isn't that quite too long?

390
00:21:45,283 --> 00:21:48,531
Talking for more than an hour from that early in the morning?

391
00:21:48,531 --> 00:21:50,731
I was discussing the matter

392
00:21:50,731 --> 00:21:52,531
because I couldn't gather stories on the water sprite!

393
00:21:52,531 --> 00:21:55,831
The printing deadline is near and my camera broke too.

394
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:58,531
What? Your camera broke?

395
00:21:58,531 --> 00:22:00,431
It got soaked in the rain!

396
00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:03,831
It suddenly raining last night when I was taking pictures outside.

397
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:10,031
On top of that, you caught a cold?

398
00:22:10,031 --> 00:22:13,311
Yeah. I had a slight cold to begin with,

399
00:22:13,531 --> 00:22:15,831
but it got worse.

400
00:22:19,317 --> 00:22:23,031
The foul smelling water that drowned Mr. Banzo Numayama.

401
00:22:23,031 --> 00:22:25,931
If it was the water from the reservoir

402
00:22:25,931 --> 00:22:28,631
where Tatsuhiko's body was found,

403
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:29,831
it can be assumed that

404
00:22:29,831 --> 00:22:34,331
this incident occurred because of Tatsuhiko's death.

405
00:22:34,331 --> 00:22:36,731
What on earth is the culprit's purpose for wanting to make it look

406
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:39,337
as if it were the curse of the water sprite?

407
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,020
Next Conan's Hint:

408
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,423
"The color green"

409
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,796
I swear I saw a water sprite!

410
00:24:07,796 --> 00:24:09,427
I understand, water spout...

411
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:10,720
-You're not taking me seriously, are you? -No. I'm not.
