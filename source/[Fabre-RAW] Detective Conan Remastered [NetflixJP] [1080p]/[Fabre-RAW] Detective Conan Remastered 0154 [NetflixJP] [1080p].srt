1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,810
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,510
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,810
Summer vacation just started.

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,910
What kind of boyfriend will Sonoko catch?

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,710
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,910
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,110
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,520
The three of us went to Izu to do some swimming,

9
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,620
Ran and I are witness to a strange summer event!

10
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,820
Can you believe it?

11
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,020
Sonoko gets herself a boyfriend, his name is Masahiko Michiwaki!

12
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,420
But while she's in seventh heaven

13
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,920
waiting for him to pick her up for their dinner date,

14
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,220
someone attacks her!

15
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,120
Is it my imagination or are we being watched?

16
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,220
The guy that Ran said she'd seen somewhere before.

17
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,820
The guy wearing the glasses is bothering me.

18
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,420
There's also Sonoko's attacker to consider.

19
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,620
Was that really...

20
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,920
just an average burglar?

21
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,120
"Sonoko's Dangerous Summer Story (Part 2)"

22
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,620
There it is!

23
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,320
What a lovely restaurant!

24
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,820
But it doesn't seem to have many customers, do they?

25
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,220
Maybe we got here too early?

26
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,120
Are you sure you aren't coming, Sonoko?

27
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,320
Go on!

28
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,020
I couldn't sleep last night,

29
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,520
thinking about that man kept me awake,

30
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,220
I'll rest here!

31
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,020
All right. But what a waste...

32
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,120
Here! There are drinks in this cooler box,

33
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,720
help yourself.

34
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,920
Thank you so much.

35
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,020
I'll see you later, Sonoko.

36
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,420
Okay. Have a nice time.

37
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,220
After your nap and if you're feeling up to it,

38
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,920
join us in the restaurant.

39
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,020
I will.

40
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,120
I'm so sleepy...

41
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,320
The seafood here is delicious.

42
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,620
I wanted Sonoko to try it.

43
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,220
What a pity.

44
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,120
I wonder if she'll be okay.

45
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,620
Sleeping inside a hot car.

46
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,020
Don't worry, I turned the air conditioner on.

47
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,220
Wow, look at this!

48
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,120
Is this for one person?

49
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,620
Certainly! There's quantity and the price is low!

50
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,320
That's the secret to this restaurant's success!

51
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,420
Hey... A full course meal for lunch?

52
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,020
See! Didn't I tell you the food was great?

53
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,720
You were right! It was delicious!

54
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,820
I'm completely stuffed.

55
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,420
Thank you very much!

56
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,020
I feel bad for Sonoko though.

57
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,820
You're from the inn.

58
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,420
Do you come here often too?

59
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,720
No. This is my first time.

60
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,820
By the way, where's your brown haired friend?

61
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,020
I haven't seen her anywhere.

62
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,120
You mean Sonoko, she didn't get enough sleep last night.

63
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,120
She's in the car parked outside.

64
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,020
Look!

65
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,120
Isn't that your car, Michiwaki?

66
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,220
What? Why is it moving?

67
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,920
Oh, no! There's a cliff up ahead!

68
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,720
Please come again...

69
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,120
What?

70
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,020
Hold on, sir. You haven't paid your bill.

71
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,320
Those are lock opening tools!

72
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,220
The side brake is disengaged!

73
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,920
Wake up, Sonoko! Sonoko!

74
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,620
I can't put full strength in while I'm running!

75
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,720
Oh, no! We're almost there!

76
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,120
Conan, get away from the car!

77
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,420
Ran.

78
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,620
Sonoko! Grab hold of me!

79
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,720
Hey! Are you all right!

80
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,320
Yes! Just barely?

81
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,520
That was close!

82
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,520
I'm glad you're safe!

83
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,920
Hey, you!

84
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,520
Why didn't you put the side brakes on?

85
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,120
Don't be ridiculous! I had them on!

86
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,720
If they weren't on,

87
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,520
the car would have fallen off the cliff a long time ago!

88
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,220
Someone released the side brakes!

89
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,820
What?

90
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:56,320
Someone broke into the car using lock picking tools!

91
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,220
Someone who wanted Sonoko dead.

92
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,820
I see...

93
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,020
So someone broke into the car

94
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,320
while Sonoko was asleep inside

95
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,120
and released the side brake

96
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,520
causing the car to move down this gentle grade

97
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,920
and fall over the cliff, is that right?

98
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,020
Here's the divers' report!

99
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,320
The side brakes of the car in the water were disengaged!

100
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,520
And we found this lying on the road.

101
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,020
These are lock picking tools!

102
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,520
Is this a professional hit?

103
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,920
It's been wiped clean of prints!

104
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,320
Did you find anything else?

105
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,220
No...

106
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,720
The only other thing we found was

107
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,820
a puddle of water that leaked out of the cooler box

108
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:49,220
where the car was parked in the parking lot.

109
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:54,720
Sonoko, did you see anyone suspicious lurking around the car?

110
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
I wouldn't know.

111
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,220
I didn't sleep much last night

112
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,520
so I was fast asleep in the car.

113
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,320
But ever since arriving in Izu,

114
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,920
we're being followed for some unknown reason.

115
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,220
The person who is following us is over there.

116
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,620
Would you mind identifying yourself?

117
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,820
I work at the inn the girls are staying at.

118
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,420
The inn is not busy during the afternoon and I had some free time

119
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,920
so I came here today to have some tea.

120
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,020
He's not the one!

121
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,820
When the car started moving,

122
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:38,720
he was already in the restaurant with us!

123
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,720
If he had broken into the car,

124
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,720
released the side brake and then come into the restaurant,

125
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,620
I could have seen him walk in.

126
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,620
I tried asking the waiter of the restaurant,

127
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,320
he told me the backdoor is always kept locked.

128
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,820
We first noticed him when he came out of the toilet

129
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:05,220
but there's no window leading out from inside the toilet!

130
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,120
And of course, Michiwaki is in the clear too!

131
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,820
He was having lunch with us at the time

132
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,220
and he never left the table.

133
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,720
Which means...

134
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,820
the most likely suspect is the man following us!

135
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,920
Who is he anyway?

136
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,210
Listen up, we'll take all your statements down at the station!

137
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,010
So please get into the cars!

138
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,010
Did you say car?

139
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:40,110
I don't feel like riding a car just yet.

140
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,010
It scares me.

141
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,410
Then why don't you and I walk to the police station?

142
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,510
It's not far from here.

143
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,810
The view's nice, it'll refresh you.

144
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,110
What do you say?

145
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,410
Yes, I'd like that!

146
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,510
Wait... Just a minute!

147
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,310
What if she's attacked again?

148
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,510
Sonoko does have brown hair, you know!

149
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:05,110
It's possible her assailant is also the murder suspect!

150
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,410
You have nothing to worry about!

151
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,910
No one would be fool enough to attack her in broad daylight.

152
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,910
But there's always the possibility!

153
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,910
Don't worry, officer!

154
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:21,310
Michiwaki will be with me and so will Ran!

155
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,610
All right then, but don't stop off anywhere.

156
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,410
Please come straight to the station!

157
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,210
Yes, sir.

158
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,310
I can't believe it.

159
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,910
The attack at the inn last night

160
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,510
and then the car incident just now.

161
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,910
What's with you anyway...

162
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,610
Sonoko... Are you sure you don't know what's going on?

163
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,610
No. I have no idea.

164
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:53,210
Maybe it's because you're so charming?

165
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,310
Why is he after her?

166
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,910
And if he wanted to kill her,

167
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:03,310
why didn't he do it when he broke into the car?

168
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,310
He didn't have to go through all that trouble

169
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,210
of having the car go over the cliff.

170
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:11,010
There's no need to use such a roundabout way.

171
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:15,210
We planned on leaving Izu as soon as we had lunch

172
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,410
so we put all our bags in the car,

173
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,510
they are all gone up in flames now.

174
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,410
Darn it! Why is all of this happening?

175
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,210
All you lost was your luggage.

176
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,510
I lost my car too

177
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,310
Yes, you're right.

178
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,210
Just because you got involved with me,

179
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,410
I guess I brought you bad luck.

180
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,610
No, I don't think of it that way.

181
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,710
If not so unlucky, you lost was your memorable photos,

182
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:41,010
you can't replace those once they're gone.

183
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:45,510
All that's left is that one picture now.

184
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,610
Only one picture left?

185
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,910
You know, the one I'm going to show Shinichi.

186
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,310
I have it on me at all times, you have nothing to worry about!

187
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,210
Eh? You still have it?

188
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,110
Get rid of it, you're making me mad!

189
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,210
That's it, it's that picture!

190
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:04,510
He wants to get rid of that picture!

191
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,110
That's why he had to send both the car over the cliff,

192
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,410
to get rid of both Sonoko and her luggage!

193
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,610
But I don't understand.

194
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:18,710
Why does he think Sonoko took an incriminating picture of him?

195
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:25,310
There wasn't a single unusual photo in the bunch.

196
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:29,010
Or did I overlook something?

197
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,210
It's him again!

198
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,410
I think we're being followed.

199
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,110
What? Is it the killer?

200
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,410
Can you run?

201
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,410
Sure...

202
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,610
All right then, here we go!

203
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,110
Let's go too!

204
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:06,010
You're putting her into more danger by going into the woods!

205
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,410
No! This is more thrilling!

206
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,210
-Right? -Oh, yes

207
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:13,310
Let's split up and lose that guy!

208
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,810
That's strange...

209
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,410
If he's Sonoko's attacker,

210
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,610
why is he still after her?

211
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,610
All the pictures were burned.

212
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,210
A train?

213
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,810
That's right.

214
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,010
This is the woods where they found the body yesterday.

215
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,810
Then we passed this place the other night.

216
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,610
I'm sure a train went by.

217
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,510
What is this?

218
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,210
I'm missing something here.

219
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,910
Darn it. I lost them.

220
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,410
The situation's turning bad.

221
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,910
Give it up!

222
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,910
If you thought we'd keep running,

223
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,310
you made a big mistake!

224
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,410
It's your fault for wearing sandals

225
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,510
when you run in the woods.

226
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,210
Sandals?

227
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,010
It was you, right?

228
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,910
You attacked Sonoko last night at the inn

229
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,610
and then today you sent the car over the cliff!

230
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,910
Hold on there! That's...

231
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,210
No use lying.

232
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,010
Your hairy arms are proof enough!

233
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,610
Let's have a look.

234
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,910
There should be bite marks

235
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,710
where Sonoko bit you last night!

236
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,210
What? It can't be...

237
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,610
There's no bite marks!

238
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,810
Maybe on the other arm!

239
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,210
What? There are no marks on this arm either.

240
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,710
What's going on?

241
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,410
Who are you anyway?

242
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,410
Well, actually...

243
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:03,010
I'm a police officer of the Chiba Prefecture Police Department.

244
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,810
You're just showing me the cover,

245
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,510
I'm not stupid enough to fall for that trick.

246
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,210
My father was once a police officer,

247
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,810
you can't fool me!

248
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,810
When an officer has to identify themself,

249
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:20,510
they must display the first pace of their police identification!

250
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,510
Shoji Terabayashi at your service.

251
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,710
Oh, my?

252
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,610
It's the real thing.

253
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,810
I've been following a suspect in a certain case...

254
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,210
A suspect?

255
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,410
Ran!

256
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,710
When you wear sandals,

257
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:36,010
you don't usually wear socks, do you?

258
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,910
I guess so.

259
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,510
Oh, no! Sonoko's in danger!

260
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,810
It hurts...

261
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,110
I stepped on a branch.

262
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,610
I guess wearing sandals in the woods wasn't such a good idea.

263
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,410
Are you all right?

264
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,810
Bite marks?

265
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,910
Why are you so surprised?

266
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,710
There's nothing to be so surprised about, is there?

267
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:12,510
After all, this is...

268
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,110
the bite mark you gave me last night.

269
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,410
Yes! So, that's it!

270
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:26,610
Sonoko didn't bite an arm last night,

271
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,710
she bit his calf.

272
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,910
It was so dark, she couldn't make it out.

273
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,310
He thought Sonoko took his picture

274
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:37,410
because the sparks the train's pantograph produces,

275
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,210
lit his back at the time of the murder.

276
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:43,910
When Sonoko passed by holding a camera,

277
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,110
he jumped to the wrong conclusion.

278
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,810
He thought there'd be a shot of him with the victim!

279
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:54,010
That's right and I remember his saying...

280
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:57,610
Don't worry. You look good in anything.

281
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,210
Whether it's a yukata or a bathing suit!

282
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,810
The only time she wore a yukata

283
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:04,510
was to the fireworks display two nights ago.

284
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,410
We only met him yesterday,

285
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,310
how could he know what she looks like in a yukata?

286
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,710
Darn it! Why didn't I...

287
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:14,610
Why didn't I figure it out sooner?

288
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:17,210
What are you doing?

289
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,110
Give me that picture.

290
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:23,810
The picture you were going to have some detective to look at!

291
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,110
You probably thought you took a picture of a couple making out

292
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,110
but I was in the midst of committing murder!

293
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,910
Just like now!

294
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,710
Four? He killed four girls?

295
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,210
If he was responsible for the murder the other night...

296
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,610
Then she's probably the fourth.

297
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:44,010
For some reason, he kills only girls with brown hair!

298
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,110
I've had him marked for a long time.

299
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,410
I got him on a stolen vehicle charge once

300
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,310
but there wasn't enough proof on the murder charge.

301
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:55,610
I came to Izu because I heard there had been a similar case

302
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,810
and behold, there he is...

303
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:02,410
But by then he already killed someone!

304
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,310
I don't understand though.

305
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,310
He was in the restaurant the whole time,

306
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,810
why'd the car start moving on its own?

307
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,110
It was the ice.

308
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:14,510
-What? -He had a cooler box.

309
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,310
He took a wedge-shaped piece of ice out.

310
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,610
Put it under the left front tire

311
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,410
so it wouldn't move.

312
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:26,210
Then pretended to talk to Sonoko who was inside

313
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,810
and released the side brake.

314
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:33,010
Then he left some lock picking tools on the ground!

315
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,310
To divert the Investigation.

316
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,010
I see...

317
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,810
That's why he left two spaces open when he parked,

318
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:44,510
so there'll be no cars obstructing his car's path when it moves.

319
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,610
On top of that, the melted ice could just appear to be water

320
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,810
that leaked out of the cooler box!

321
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,210
But why?

322
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,010
Why does he kill only girls with brown hair?

323
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,410
I told you, didn't I?

324
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,610
A girl jilted me in a cruel way.

325
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:01,010
That's why... That's the reason...

326
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,610
Whenever I see flirty girls like you,

327
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,010
I get so mad.

328
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,710
Girls with brown hair remind me of her,

329
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,810
how she ruined my life?

330
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,710
Look over there, isn't that Sonoko?

331
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,810
What?

332
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,110
Oh, no!

333
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,710
Why? I don't get it!

334
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:24,610
Why all the men that get close to me are so weird!

335
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,010
I hate you, God!

336
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,410
Are you all right?

337
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,410
I'm fine. How about you?

338
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,110
Oh, this?

339
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,210
Now I remember!

340
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,710
I knew I'd seen that guy with the glasses before,

341
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,310
it was at the tournament!

342
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,610
What?

343
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:01,310
He's captain of the Haido High School Karate Club!

344
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,110
He is the Kick Attack King!

345
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,310
Makoto Kyougoku.

346
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,610
Amazing!

347
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,910
You're a very reckless lady.

348
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,610
You're just lucky I had some free time

349
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,010
and just happened to be close by.

350
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,610
Free time?

351
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,410
Do you mean you were following me all this time?

352
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,710
That's right, I was following you!

353
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,910
Until I lost sight of you in the woods.

354
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:34,010
I knew you might think I was a stalker.

355
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,910
Before he met you,

356
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,610
he'd been flirting with a few other girls,

357
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,910
it got me worried.

358
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,610
Why did you worry about me?

359
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,610
You didn't even know me...

360
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,610
You didn't notice me

361
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:53,910
but I'd seen you once before, at a karate tournament.

362
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,810
You were cheering like mad for your friend.

363
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:01,510
I never dreamed you'd reserve a room in our inn.

364
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,610
Oh, and...

365
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,410
I suggest you stop wearing outfits

366
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,610
that looks like child clothes,

367
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,610
it arouses the guys more than necessary.

368
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,910
Of course!

369
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,610
You're free to ignore my advice

370
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,110
and pass it off as just another casual remark

371
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:24,210
made by one of your many suitors.

372
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:12,710
"Teitan High School" -What? Makoto's gone abroad to study?

373
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,210
But why?

374
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:17,010
You and he were getting along so tell since then, weren't you?

375
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:20,110
He said there was no one strong left in Japan

376
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,610
so he went off to train abroad.

377
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,310
"Mouri Detective Agency, 3 days later"

378
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:29,210
Ran, let's go see the baseball team's practice game!

379
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,710
The other team's ace is a sophomore,

380
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,210
I hear he's so cute and just so adorable!

381
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:38,910
Good grief. I thought you were going to wait for Makoto to return.

382
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,210
That was then.

383
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,710
This is now.

384
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,410
I knew it.
