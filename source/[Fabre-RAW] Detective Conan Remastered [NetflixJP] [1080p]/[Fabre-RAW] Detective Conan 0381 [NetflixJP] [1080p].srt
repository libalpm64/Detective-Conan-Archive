1
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,280
A case where building blocks are the clues.

2
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,880
Heiji's and Sleeping Kogoro's deductions conflict!

3
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,980
Which one will win?

4
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,480
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,180
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,180
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:56,887 --> 00:02:00,187
Here's your Detective Samonji, File. 44.

8
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:03,087
"Testament With the Devil's Trap, Part 2".

9
00:02:04,987 --> 00:02:06,087
This is it.

10
00:02:06,087 --> 00:02:10,087
I knew you wanted it so bad, so I kept one for you.

11
00:02:10,087 --> 00:02:12,387
Really?

12
00:02:12,387 --> 00:02:13,987
Thank you so much, sir!

13
00:02:15,587 --> 00:02:19,087
I've been waiting this for so long.

14
00:02:22,687 --> 00:02:25,287
All right! I have to eat supper real quick

15
00:02:25,287 --> 00:02:27,787
so I can finish the book before going to bed.

16
00:02:27,787 --> 00:02:30,187
And tomorrow morning, I'm going to read it all over again.

17
00:02:30,187 --> 00:02:32,687
I can't wait! I just can't wait.

18
00:02:35,687 --> 00:02:37,887
I'm back!

19
00:02:37,887 --> 00:02:39,587
Welcome home...

20
00:02:42,987 --> 00:02:49,287
"The Deduction Battle (Part 1)"

21
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:50,787
Welcome home...

22
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:56,687
All right! The kid is back.

23
00:02:56,687 --> 00:02:59,187
Let's go out and eat at a fancy restaurant, right?

24
00:02:59,187 --> 00:03:01,887
Sure. It's kind of early,

25
00:03:01,887 --> 00:03:04,787
so I guess we could go a little farther than usual.

26
00:03:04,787 --> 00:03:06,987
Hey, kid. How about it?

27
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,587
What do you want to eat?

28
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:10,587
-I'll pass! -Pass?

29
00:03:10,587 --> 00:03:13,387
Pasta? You mean Italian food.

30
00:03:13,387 --> 00:03:14,487
I remember!

31
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:17,887
I heard there's a new fancy Italian restaurant in Haido Town.

32
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:19,587
All right. Let's go there.

33
00:03:19,587 --> 00:03:23,087
Right. It's not so far from here, too.

34
00:03:23,087 --> 00:03:25,287
All right. Let's go.

35
00:03:29,487 --> 00:03:31,387
Man, that was good.

36
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:35,087
It's nice to have real spaghetti once in a while.

37
00:03:35,087 --> 00:03:37,287
Right! We made the right choice, didn't we?

38
00:03:37,287 --> 00:03:39,587
Yes! It was fantastic.

39
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:43,287
So why are you guys here, Kazuha and...

40
00:03:45,387 --> 00:03:48,287
this dark-skinned guy.

41
00:03:48,287 --> 00:03:51,287
Hey! What was that? What the heck was that?

42
00:03:51,287 --> 00:03:54,287
Well, you came here without telling me anything beforehand.

43
00:03:54,287 --> 00:03:57,287
I've got a schedule, too.

44
00:03:57,287 --> 00:03:59,687
Right, speaking of schedule,

45
00:03:59,687 --> 00:04:01,987
that's the reason why we came here!

46
00:04:01,987 --> 00:04:04,687
We wanted to ask you about your schedule.

47
00:04:04,687 --> 00:04:06,187
Schedule?

48
00:04:06,187 --> 00:04:09,987
Yes. We want you guys to come to Osaka again.

49
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:13,387
There are many nice places that we haven't shown you yet.

50
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,787
What do you mean by nice places?

51
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:17,587
Of course.

52
00:04:17,587 --> 00:04:19,387
It's the symbol of Osaka.

53
00:04:19,387 --> 00:04:22,187
-Koshien Stadium. -Takarazuka Revue.

54
00:04:22,187 --> 00:04:24,387
Koshien Stadium?

55
00:04:24,387 --> 00:04:25,687
Takarazuka Revue?

56
00:04:27,087 --> 00:04:29,487
Those are not in Osaka.

57
00:04:29,487 --> 00:04:33,187
Hey, what's this about Koshien Stadium?

58
00:04:33,187 --> 00:04:35,787
We didn't talk about Takarazuka Revue either.

59
00:04:35,787 --> 00:04:37,287
Have you forgot already?

60
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:38,687
I told you I was going to get the tickets

61
00:04:38,687 --> 00:04:41,287
to the Takarazuka Revue from my neighbours.

62
00:04:41,287 --> 00:04:44,587
Oh, right. I remember you said something like that.

63
00:04:44,587 --> 00:04:48,187
All right, then why don't we go to both?

64
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:50,687
Okay! It's the final game of the high school baseball tournament

65
00:04:50,687 --> 00:04:53,387
that I really want to watch with you guys.

66
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:56,487
Oh, no. We can't go to both.

67
00:04:56,487 --> 00:04:58,287
Kazuha, what's wrong?

68
00:04:58,287 --> 00:05:02,287
Hey, don't tell me you got the tickets from the five crazy ladies?

69
00:05:02,287 --> 00:05:04,087
I did.

70
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:05,487
Who are those ladies?

71
00:05:06,587 --> 00:05:11,187
They are enthusiastic fans of Takarazuka Revue.

72
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:13,387
They save their money throughout the year

73
00:05:13,387 --> 00:05:17,687
and spend all of it for the Takarazuka shows during summer time.

74
00:05:17,687 --> 00:05:19,687
I heard they go to every single show,

75
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:22,287
but there is one show that they all cannot go to.

76
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:24,587
Don't tell me that's the day of...

77
00:05:24,587 --> 00:05:26,687
The final game of the high school baseball tournament?

78
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,787
Those ladies are working for the same company,

79
00:05:30,787 --> 00:05:33,787
and their boss is a huge fan of high school baseball.

80
00:05:33,787 --> 00:05:37,787
Every year, all the workers go and watch the final game of the tournament,

81
00:05:37,787 --> 00:05:39,987
and that's why I got the Takarazuka tickets

82
00:05:39,987 --> 00:05:41,987
for the show playing on the same day as the final game.

83
00:05:41,987 --> 00:05:43,387
I see.

84
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:46,387
It doesn't matter whether the final gets postponed to another day or not.

85
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:50,087
It's still going to be the same day as the final game anyway.

86
00:05:50,087 --> 00:05:51,887
Well, I feel sorry for you, Kazuha.

87
00:05:51,887 --> 00:05:53,687
But I think you should forget it this time.

88
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:54,787
What?

89
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:57,787
Takarazuka Revue plays the same show many times a year.

90
00:05:57,787 --> 00:05:59,387
But the final game of the high school baseball tournament

91
00:05:59,387 --> 00:06:01,287
is just once and that's it.

92
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:03,187
I can't miss it.

93
00:06:03,187 --> 00:06:04,687
What are you talking about?

94
00:06:04,687 --> 00:06:06,887
Those baseball games are on the sports news and stuff.

95
00:06:06,887 --> 00:06:08,787
You can watch them many times.

96
00:06:08,787 --> 00:06:09,787
Stupid.

97
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:11,187
You have to watch it live!

98
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:13,687
Who in the world likes to watch only the result of the games on TV?

99
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:17,687
But I have to watch the Takarazuka show live, too!

100
00:06:17,687 --> 00:06:20,087
They are amazing seats.

101
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:23,387
You'll never get seats like these again if you miss this opportunity.

102
00:06:23,387 --> 00:06:26,787
Hey, Ran. You want to watch the Takarazuka show, right?

103
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:28,587
Yes.

104
00:06:28,587 --> 00:06:31,787
Hey, kid. You're a man. You love baseball, right?

105
00:06:31,787 --> 00:06:34,887
Of course.

106
00:06:34,887 --> 00:06:36,987
Then what about you, Mr. Mouri?

107
00:06:36,987 --> 00:06:38,787
Let me see.

108
00:06:38,787 --> 00:06:41,887
Well, I love the seriousness and excitement of baseball games!

109
00:06:41,887 --> 00:06:43,087
But at the same time,

110
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:45,987
I love the beauty and gorgeousness of the Takarazuka shows, too.

111
00:06:45,987 --> 00:06:47,587
-Make up your mind. -Make up your mind.

112
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:49,987
Okay, how about this?

113
00:06:49,987 --> 00:06:54,987
Whoever wins a deduction battle gets to see what he or she wants.

114
00:06:54,987 --> 00:06:56,287
Deduction...

115
00:06:56,287 --> 00:06:57,787
Battle?

116
00:06:57,787 --> 00:07:02,687
At the end of last month, there was a murder in the office of a company.

117
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:04,687
This murder case needs further investigation,

118
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:08,687
so Inspector Megure has asked me for help on it.

119
00:07:08,687 --> 00:07:11,587
That company is actually in this area

120
00:07:11,587 --> 00:07:15,187
and I was thinking about going there after dinner.

121
00:07:15,187 --> 00:07:18,487
Although it's unethical to treat a murder case like this,

122
00:07:18,487 --> 00:07:20,887
I thought you guys could come and help us.

123
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:24,587
It's not so bad because we are helping to solve the murder case, right?

124
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:28,987
All right. So Kazuha, you and I are going to fight.

125
00:07:28,987 --> 00:07:30,587
That's not fair.

126
00:07:30,587 --> 00:07:33,987
There's no way I can beat you in a deduction battle.

127
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:34,987
Of course.

128
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:40,587
I, the Sleeping Kogoro will be on your side, Kazuha. You can rely on me.

129
00:07:40,587 --> 00:07:43,887
Seriously? Thanks a lot, man!

130
00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:48,587
Well, Sleeping Kogoro always stands up for the weak.

131
00:07:52,587 --> 00:07:55,687
I know what's really in your mind, old man.

132
00:07:55,687 --> 00:07:57,787
Ran. I need your help, too.

133
00:07:57,787 --> 00:07:58,987
Sure! Why not?

134
00:07:58,987 --> 00:08:00,587
Let's beat them and watch the Takarazuka show!

135
00:08:00,587 --> 00:08:04,087
You dummy rat. You got two people on your side.

136
00:08:05,787 --> 00:08:07,087
Well, what can I say?

137
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:10,587
I guess I have to take this little kid with me.

138
00:08:10,587 --> 00:08:14,487
You are the dummy rat, Heiji.

139
00:08:14,487 --> 00:08:16,587
Hey, Mouri.

140
00:08:16,587 --> 00:08:18,387
Thanks for coming.

141
00:08:18,387 --> 00:08:19,687
No problem.

142
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:20,687
Let's go inside.

143
00:08:20,687 --> 00:08:22,287
Stop blocking the way.

144
00:08:22,287 --> 00:08:23,687
Heiji?

145
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:27,087
Hey, you. You're not allowed at the murder scene.

146
00:08:27,087 --> 00:08:28,187
Don't worry about it.

147
00:08:28,187 --> 00:08:31,987
The forensic officers are done searching the murder scene, right?

148
00:08:31,987 --> 00:08:34,187
Well, yes.

149
00:08:35,187 --> 00:08:38,987
The victim is the owner of a toy production company,

150
00:08:38,987 --> 00:08:41,987
Kenji Tsujiya, 53 years old.

151
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:45,887
He worked and also lived here.

152
00:08:45,887 --> 00:08:50,887
The estimated time of death was the 29th of last month, Sunday, around 5pm.

153
00:08:50,887 --> 00:08:56,487
The dead body was found on the 30th, Monday, around 10am.

154
00:08:56,487 --> 00:08:58,087
Who found it?

155
00:08:58,087 --> 00:09:01,487
Four workers in this company found it.

156
00:09:01,487 --> 00:09:03,587
Four workers.

157
00:09:03,587 --> 00:09:07,887
These four workers always come a little early in the morning,

158
00:09:07,887 --> 00:09:10,487
and eat breakfast in a coffee house down there,

159
00:09:10,487 --> 00:09:12,787
then come to the office together.

160
00:09:12,787 --> 00:09:15,587
I see. That's why it's four people.

161
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:18,187
And these four workers found their boss,

162
00:09:18,187 --> 00:09:23,687
who was tied with a rope and beaten to death with a golf club.

163
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:26,087
How do you know that, Heiji?

164
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:29,187
You see the ink spot around the victim's back?

165
00:09:29,187 --> 00:09:30,187
Yes.

166
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:35,787
Perhaps the ink spilled over when they were fighting.

167
00:09:35,787 --> 00:09:39,287
But the murderer didn't care and just tied the owner up with a rope.

168
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:44,087
I saw the marks of the rope all over the floor.

169
00:09:44,087 --> 00:09:47,087
So I thought he was wriggling on the floor with his hands tied behind him.

170
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,887
Okay, but what about him being beaten with a golf club?

171
00:09:51,887 --> 00:09:54,287
I saw the blood on his head.

172
00:09:54,287 --> 00:09:59,887
And also, see the thin marks on the floor near his head?

173
00:09:59,887 --> 00:10:02,787
These are from iron clubs.

174
00:10:02,787 --> 00:10:05,087
The murderer missed the head and hit the floor

175
00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:07,787
when he or she was beating the owner who was lying on the floor.

176
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:11,487
But why did the murderer tied him up first, and then clubbed him?

177
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:14,487
Maybe the murderer wanted the combination of the safe.

178
00:10:14,487 --> 00:10:19,687
See? The door of the safe is left wide open.

179
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:20,887
I see.

180
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,387
Some outsider committed the murder for the money, is that it?

181
00:10:23,387 --> 00:10:26,387
I don't know whether it was an outsider or not.

182
00:10:26,387 --> 00:10:27,787
But it's certain that the murderer tied the president up first

183
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:29,987
in order to get the combination out of him.

184
00:10:29,987 --> 00:10:32,287
And then, the murderer clubbed him to death

185
00:10:32,287 --> 00:10:36,287
because the president saw his or her face.

186
00:10:37,987 --> 00:10:40,487
Something like that. Right, Inspector?

187
00:10:40,487 --> 00:10:42,787
Right.

188
00:10:42,787 --> 00:10:45,187
Hey, are you going to be all right, Dad?

189
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:47,587
The boys are dominating this deduction battle.

190
00:10:47,587 --> 00:10:48,987
Are they?

191
00:10:48,987 --> 00:10:50,387
Well, it's not a hard thing to do.

192
00:10:50,387 --> 00:10:53,487
With this murder scene, even a policeman can make a deduction like this.

193
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:56,087
-Even a policeman... -Hey.

194
00:10:56,087 --> 00:10:59,787
This isn't everything, right? There must be something else.

195
00:10:59,787 --> 00:11:01,387
Come on. Let it out.

196
00:11:02,887 --> 00:11:04,187
All right.

197
00:11:07,787 --> 00:11:11,787
We found these on the floor around the victim's dead body.

198
00:11:11,787 --> 00:11:14,087
These four building blocks.

199
00:11:15,687 --> 00:11:19,187
But there are other building blocks near the victim's dead body.

200
00:11:20,487 --> 00:11:22,387
Actually, we found the victim's fingerprints

201
00:11:22,387 --> 00:11:25,687
and also ink on those four blocks.

202
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:28,087
Ink?

203
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,487
If you look at the ink-spotted side of each building block...

204
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:43,487
And this is the last one.

205
00:11:45,387 --> 00:11:48,287
-Toy? -Toy?

206
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:01,532
Toy?

207
00:12:01,532 --> 00:12:04,032
No. Is it rice cake store?

208
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:06,532
I think it's rice cake store, don't you think?

209
00:12:07,532 --> 00:12:08,832
Right.

210
00:12:08,832 --> 00:12:10,032
If it really means "omocha",

211
00:12:10,032 --> 00:12:12,532
then whoever made this could've picked the other block to spell it right.

212
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:13,832
Inspector.

213
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:18,732
Can you tell me specifically where the four blocks in the pictures were?

214
00:12:18,732 --> 00:12:19,932
Sure.

215
00:12:19,932 --> 00:12:23,232
This is how it looked when we found the dead body.

216
00:12:23,232 --> 00:12:25,632
I guess this guy is the...

217
00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:27,932
Yes, he's the victim.

218
00:12:27,932 --> 00:12:31,632
The president of this toy production company, Mr. Tsujiya.

219
00:12:31,632 --> 00:12:36,732
From the stack of the building blocks by the victim's dead body,

220
00:12:36,732 --> 00:12:40,032
we found the four blocks with characters "o", "mo", "chi", and "ya".

221
00:12:40,032 --> 00:12:43,632
Each of them had the victim's fingerprints and an ink spot on it.

222
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:47,132
The ink spots on the blocks

223
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:53,332
and the one that's on the victim's back came from the same bottle.

224
00:12:54,632 --> 00:12:58,832
The problem is, who put the ink spots on those four building blocks?

225
00:12:58,832 --> 00:12:59,832
Right.

226
00:12:59,832 --> 00:13:03,732
We found the victim's fingerprints on those blocks,

227
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:05,932
but it could be that the murderer made the president hold them

228
00:13:05,932 --> 00:13:09,032
to hide something.

229
00:13:09,032 --> 00:13:10,532
Hey.

230
00:13:10,532 --> 00:13:14,932
These are really the only ones that have the owner's fingerprints?

231
00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:20,132
Actually the fingerprints are on some other blocks.

232
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:24,532
But we found that these four blocks have fingerprints all over them.

233
00:13:24,532 --> 00:13:26,332
I mean on every single side.

234
00:13:26,332 --> 00:13:30,032
Even on those characters.

235
00:13:30,032 --> 00:13:33,732
So I guess it's possible to think that those four blocks

236
00:13:33,732 --> 00:13:38,232
are the owner's dying message.

237
00:13:38,232 --> 00:13:41,832
What? What makes you think that?

238
00:13:41,832 --> 00:13:44,032
Look closely at the picture of the murder scene.

239
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:48,332
His hands are tied behind his back, right?

240
00:13:48,332 --> 00:13:53,832
You can hardly see and touch anything if your hands are tied like this.

241
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:57,332
His fingerprints were on every single side of the four blocks

242
00:13:57,332 --> 00:14:01,832
because the victim was searching for the correct blocks.

243
00:14:01,832 --> 00:14:04,732
He touched some other blocks,

244
00:14:04,732 --> 00:14:06,732
but not so many fingerprints were found from them.

245
00:14:06,732 --> 00:14:11,432
That's because each block is designed to have five characters in the order.

246
00:14:11,432 --> 00:14:13,732
So it's not so hard to find which one's which.

247
00:14:13,732 --> 00:14:15,332
I see.

248
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:19,332
That's why we found so many fingerprints particularly on the four blocks.

249
00:14:19,332 --> 00:14:23,132
In fact, fingerprints are made of sweat and skin oil

250
00:14:23,132 --> 00:14:24,532
and that's why they remain on things.

251
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:27,932
But once people die, these things stop coming out.

252
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:31,732
So even if you try to leave fingerprints of a dead body,

253
00:14:31,732 --> 00:14:33,532
you can only get one or two solid ones.

254
00:14:36,032 --> 00:14:39,132
Perhaps when the murderer wasn't looking,

255
00:14:39,132 --> 00:14:43,332
the victim took the four blocks with his hands tied behind his back.

256
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:46,832
Then, rolled his body and put the ink on those blocks.

257
00:14:46,832 --> 00:14:52,532
And, he rolled his body back again to put them back to where they were.

258
00:14:52,532 --> 00:14:56,932
I'm sure his hands were full of sweat because of fear of death.

259
00:14:56,932 --> 00:15:02,232
As a matter of fact, the marks of the rope all over the floor prove that.

260
00:15:02,232 --> 00:15:03,732
So it's possible to think

261
00:15:03,732 --> 00:15:09,432
that the feeling of danger actually made the owner choose the wrong block.

262
00:15:09,432 --> 00:15:11,632
This is a toy production company.

263
00:15:11,632 --> 00:15:13,732
Logically, the dying message must be toys

264
00:15:13,732 --> 00:15:17,032
rather than rice cake store, don't you think?

265
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:19,632
Oh, my God. We just got here.

266
00:15:19,632 --> 00:15:21,732
How could you come up with so many things in such a short while?

267
00:15:21,732 --> 00:15:24,432
Yeah, I know. That's my boy.

268
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:28,332
This isn't good, Ran.

269
00:15:28,332 --> 00:15:30,832
He's dominating us mentally.

270
00:15:30,832 --> 00:15:33,432
This is a battle between Heiji and us!

271
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,832
It's either the baseball game or Takarazuka show.

272
00:15:37,432 --> 00:15:39,532
To win this deduction battle,

273
00:15:39,532 --> 00:15:43,932
we have to find out what the dying message really meant first.

274
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:47,832
Maybe there are some hints in the other toys.

275
00:15:47,832 --> 00:15:50,932
No, we found no strange toys other than the blocks.

276
00:15:50,932 --> 00:15:53,032
-Are you sure? -Yes.

277
00:15:53,032 --> 00:15:57,632
We checked every single toy in this office

278
00:15:57,632 --> 00:16:00,232
looking for some other dying messages that could be hiding.

279
00:16:02,532 --> 00:16:06,532
Then, maybe the dying message has a different meaning.

280
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,332
What do you mean?

281
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:11,832
Different combinations of four of the characters, you mean?

282
00:16:11,832 --> 00:16:14,832
Omoyachi, ochimoya, ochiyamo...

283
00:16:14,832 --> 00:16:16,332
Oyamochi, oyachimo, mochiyao...

284
00:16:16,332 --> 00:16:18,432
It doesn't make sense at all.

285
00:16:18,432 --> 00:16:21,132
All right, what else have we got?

286
00:16:28,132 --> 00:16:32,932
We found only a golf club and a leather coat with the victim's blood on it,

287
00:16:32,932 --> 00:16:35,932
which we assume the murderer was wearing during the murder.

288
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:42,932
But the golf club and the leather coat are the victim's belongings.

289
00:16:42,932 --> 00:16:46,132
So they didn't help us determine who killed him.

290
00:16:46,132 --> 00:16:51,332
What's more confusing is that the murderer was wearing that leather coat.

291
00:16:51,332 --> 00:16:54,932
The bloodstain. It's faded only around the left shoulder.

292
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:57,032
It's got rubbed against something.

293
00:16:57,032 --> 00:16:59,832
Actually, that's another mystery.

294
00:16:59,832 --> 00:17:02,032
We searched throughout this office,

295
00:17:02,032 --> 00:17:06,232
but found no spots where the bloodstain got rubbed against.

296
00:17:06,232 --> 00:17:09,332
The murderer may have touched it when he or she took it off.

297
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:12,332
You haven't found gloves or something like that, right?

298
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:13,632
Hey.

299
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,232
Speaking of blood,

300
00:17:15,232 --> 00:17:18,632
there's a strange bloodstain right here.

301
00:17:18,632 --> 00:17:20,532
-Where is it? -Right here.

302
00:17:22,032 --> 00:17:23,532
Why'd you crawl under there?

303
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:25,132
-This is it. -Hold on a sec.

304
00:17:26,232 --> 00:17:28,132
You have to look at it really close.

305
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:31,032
You see the part where the bloodstain ends unnaturally?

306
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:33,932
Maybe something was here, don't you think?

307
00:17:33,932 --> 00:17:37,432
Could be. What kind of thing would you put here though?

308
00:17:40,232 --> 00:17:43,232
Where is the remote?

309
00:17:43,232 --> 00:17:46,732
Hey! Don't touch them.

310
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,632
We have to keep the desk just like the way it is.

311
00:17:54,932 --> 00:17:57,132
It's external input only.

312
00:17:57,132 --> 00:18:02,432
So then, maybe a video camera was here until the victim was murdered.

313
00:18:02,432 --> 00:18:06,032
The video camera was in the president's room.

314
00:18:06,032 --> 00:18:07,732
Okay, then. Call the forensic officer

315
00:18:07,732 --> 00:18:10,532
to check if there's any blood on it, will you?

316
00:18:10,532 --> 00:18:12,132
It's strange.

317
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,732
Let's assume that the video camera was here.

318
00:18:14,732 --> 00:18:18,132
But why would the murderer move it after killing the owner?

319
00:18:18,132 --> 00:18:19,832
The murderer connected the video camera to the TV

320
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:23,532
just to watch the president after tying him up?

321
00:18:23,532 --> 00:18:26,232
Then why did he remove it? The owner was dead.

322
00:18:29,032 --> 00:18:30,132
Also...

323
00:18:31,832 --> 00:18:34,232
Something's been bugging me ever since I got here.

324
00:18:35,332 --> 00:18:37,432
Right here, in this office.

325
00:18:37,432 --> 00:18:40,532
There's something odd, something unnatural.

326
00:18:40,532 --> 00:18:43,032
Hey, Conan.

327
00:18:43,032 --> 00:18:45,232
What's up, Ran?

328
00:18:45,232 --> 00:18:48,132
Could you do me a favour?

329
00:18:48,132 --> 00:18:52,932
I really want Kazuha to win this deduction battle.

330
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:58,332
I think she is really looking forward to see the Takarazuka show with us.

331
00:18:58,332 --> 00:19:00,732
So, next time you come up with a good idea or something,

332
00:19:00,732 --> 00:19:03,032
I want you to tell us quietly.

333
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:05,332
I'll give Dad your ideas

334
00:19:05,332 --> 00:19:09,332
and Sleeping Kogoro will take care of the rest like always.

335
00:19:09,332 --> 00:19:11,432
Yes? Please?

336
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:14,532
Please?

337
00:19:18,232 --> 00:19:19,332
Conan, please?

338
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:20,632
Hey...

339
00:19:23,232 --> 00:19:26,032
This kid is mine.

340
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,532
So stop headhunting him, will you?

341
00:19:32,532 --> 00:19:37,732
Of course you respect a guy's friendship more than one with girls, right?

342
00:19:37,732 --> 00:19:39,232
Friendship?

343
00:19:39,232 --> 00:19:41,732
I'm on your side only because you gave me no choice.

344
00:19:43,232 --> 00:19:44,232
Doesn't matter!

345
00:19:44,232 --> 00:19:48,232
We have to win this the battle anyway. We have to watch the final game!

346
00:19:48,232 --> 00:19:50,232
Oh, what a guy.

347
00:19:52,532 --> 00:19:54,032
How was the identification?

348
00:19:54,032 --> 00:19:55,032
We found it.

349
00:19:55,032 --> 00:19:56,332
We found the victim's blood even though it was very slight.

350
00:19:56,332 --> 00:19:58,932
I guess the murderer did not realize it.

351
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:02,132
But why was the video camera here anyway?

352
00:20:02,132 --> 00:20:04,132
Perhaps the murderer connected the camera to the TV

353
00:20:04,132 --> 00:20:08,532
and watched the owner until he spit out the combination to the safe.

354
00:20:08,532 --> 00:20:12,232
But why do something round about like that?

355
00:20:12,232 --> 00:20:15,132
Why not just tie him up and wait in front of the safe

356
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:16,932
until he spits out the combination?

357
00:20:16,932 --> 00:20:21,532
He left the video camera on, to keep him from moving around

358
00:20:21,532 --> 00:20:24,832
because he was ransacking the other rooms.

359
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:30,932
The murderer didn't know the victim left a dying message.

360
00:20:30,932 --> 00:20:35,232
Well now, it is more likely that the murderer is well acquainted

361
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:39,632
with this office and also with the victim.

362
00:20:39,632 --> 00:20:42,432
The president left a dying message.

363
00:20:42,432 --> 00:20:46,632
If we get it right, it's possible to find out who the murder is.

364
00:20:46,632 --> 00:20:50,632
Then, we should investigate the four workers who found the dead body.

365
00:20:50,632 --> 00:20:53,232
Takagi is asking them about their alibi right now.

366
00:20:53,232 --> 00:20:54,232
Inspector Megure.

367
00:20:55,732 --> 00:20:58,532
I just finished the interrogation.

368
00:20:58,532 --> 00:21:00,532
And how was it?

369
00:21:02,832 --> 00:21:05,132
They are all designers

370
00:21:05,132 --> 00:21:08,632
but also do some other types of work, like Nao Aiko, who does accounting.

371
00:21:08,632 --> 00:21:11,532
June 29th around 5pm, when the murder occurred,

372
00:21:11,532 --> 00:21:13,932
she was out fishing alone.

373
00:21:13,932 --> 00:21:18,732
Atushi Hasami, the salesperson, was watching a movie at home.

374
00:21:18,732 --> 00:21:22,632
Isao Nakagami, the planner, was at the turf.

375
00:21:22,632 --> 00:21:24,932
Hajime Iwatomi, the vice president,

376
00:21:24,932 --> 00:21:28,832
was out watching the final round of a golf tournament.

377
00:21:28,832 --> 00:21:31,432
Those are all very vague alibis.

378
00:21:31,432 --> 00:21:35,332
Yes. Right now, Chiba is verifying their stories

379
00:21:35,332 --> 00:21:37,032
and if there is anything hiding behind the stories.

380
00:21:37,032 --> 00:21:39,032
It seems nobody is able to prove their alibi. Not even one.

381
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:40,632
Hiding...

382
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,632
Behind...

383
00:21:42,632 --> 00:21:46,432
Wait a minute. If the situation was...

384
00:21:46,432 --> 00:21:48,932
That dying message on the four blocks is...

385
00:21:56,932 --> 00:22:00,432
It was so easy.

386
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:03,132
How come I didn't realize this?

387
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,232
Kazuha, I'm sorry.

388
00:22:07,232 --> 00:22:09,732
This battle is mine.

389
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:32,432
Kazuha?

390
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:34,159
Next Conan's Hint:

391
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,459
"Calendar"

392
00:24:36,459 --> 00:24:37,659
The battle finally ends in the next episode!

393
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:39,459
Kazuha or Heiji?

394
00:24:39,459 --> 00:24:41,063
-Who do you think is going to win? -Who do you think is going to win?
