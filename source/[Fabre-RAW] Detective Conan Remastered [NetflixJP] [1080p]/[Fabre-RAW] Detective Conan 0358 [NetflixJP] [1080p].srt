1
00:00:22,672 --> 00:00:24,272
The stars of today's episode are these two.

2
00:00:24,272 --> 00:00:25,972
A cute date with many chaperones.

3
00:00:25,972 --> 00:00:27,872
A very serious case also comes along.

4
00:00:27,872 --> 00:00:29,472
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,472 --> 00:00:31,272
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,272 --> 00:00:33,272
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,920
Spit it out!

8
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,220
Spit it out and relieve yourself.

9
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,220
You didn't go to a class reunion, did you?

10
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,820
You couldn't think of anything else to say.

11
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,020
That's why you said so, right?

12
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,620
No...

13
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,220
I... I really went to a class reunion...

14
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,020
Don't play dumb with us!

15
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,720
Do you think you can get away with something like that?

16
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,920
That's enough. Spit out the truth, Takagi!

17
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,120
Inspector Shiratori, we got back up info.

18
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,520
The thing about him going to a class reunion is a lie.

19
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,020
Moreover, we found this in his desk.

20
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,720
"Ticket"

21
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,120
Not only did you deceive us,

22
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,820
but you also have something like this on you.

23
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,020
That's...

24
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,520
It seems that you've taken action

25
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,420
which is against the moral of the police.

26
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,320
Come on, and spit it out.

27
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,020
Your mother in your home country is crying.

28
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,120
Takagi.

29
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,720
Takagi!

30
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:22,020
"Love Story at Police Headquarters #5 (Part 1)"

31
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,820
"Tropical Marine Land"

32
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,420
And?

33
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,220
You mean you told them about today's date...

34
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,120
No, I haven't said a word!

35
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,720
I really pulled through this time.

36
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,020
I... I didn't say a word.

37
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,620
Really?

38
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,520
I even went out of my way

39
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,720
to leave a platinum ticket in my desk.

40
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,520
So, I'm sure that everyone's been distracted by it by now

41
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,120
and is going to stake us out at Tohto Dome.

42
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,320
Seriously.

43
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,020
I don't know why they get all heated up like that over a mere date.

44
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,320
You must be extremely popular, Officer Takagi.

45
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,720
I'm not the one who's popular...

46
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,520
What... what's this sharp glance that I'm sensing?

47
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,820
This is group D, Fukui and Kawanaka.

48
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,220
We've spotted Ms. Sato and Takagi.

49
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,620
Our target is currently having a friendly chat

50
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,120
at Cafe Aqua in area 3.

51
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,620
This is group E, Horita and Saito.

52
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,220
We've succeeded in taking a picture of them from behind the counter.

53
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,920
This is group B, Oda and Miyazaki.

54
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,120
We have taken seats behind the two.

55
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,520
Roger.

56
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,020
Remember to keep on your guard.

57
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,720
Understand, our goal

58
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,420
is not to watch over their dating with warmth.

59
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,620
Should they behave in a queer manner or make any moves,

60
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,420
be sure to report back to me immediately.

61
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,320
Speaking about queer behavior,

62
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,020
Ms. Sato's been acting strange since this morning.

63
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,920
-Strange, you said? -Yes, sir.

64
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,320
She's not her usual dignified self, but rather...

65
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,920
I don't know how to express it.

66
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,420
-She... she's cute. -She... she's cute.

67
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,120
That's bad.

68
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,320
Officer Takagi may resort to immoral actions.

69
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,420
Officer Oda and Miyazaki,

70
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:37,120
I want you to carry out strategy 104 in manual C immediately.

71
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,720
And you know, Yumi told me...

72
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,320
-Hey, did you see yesterday's paper? -Yeah.

73
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,020
They specified the hideout

74
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,620
of a drug dealer, and still let them get away.

75
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,120
The police really are no good like always.

76
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,120
Hey!

77
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,820
Stop talking nonsense.

78
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,520
They didn't flee.

79
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,620
It was misinformation to begin with!

80
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,120
Ms. Sato, please calm down.

81
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,220
Where are you going?

82
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,620
To the ladies' room. Does that bug you?

83
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,920
We did it!

84
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,220
We've succeeded. She's back to her usual self.

85
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,220
Roger.

86
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,820
Hey, wait a second.

87
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,220
Takagi is taking something out of his bag.

88
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,920
That's...

89
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,320
a ring.

90
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,620
There's no doubt about it.

91
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,620
I'm sure he's going to give it to Ms. Sato.

92
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,020
What shall we do?

93
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,420
If we're going to confiscate it, now's the time to do so.

94
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,920
Please calm down. That's within assumption.

95
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,720
I've already got something worked out.

96
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,020
What a relief.

97
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,320
What's that?

98
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,320
Well, it's nothing.

99
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,720
What? What is it?

100
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,620
Is it something you don't want me to see?

101
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,720
No, I mean...

102
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,320
I'll show this to you a little later.

103
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,020
It's Officer Takagi and Officer Sato!

104
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,420
You kids... What?

105
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,020
Dr. Agasa!

106
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,320
What brings you here?

107
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:16,020
Well, Inspector Shiratori sent me the tickets to come here.

108
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,620
He said that it's his token of gratitude towards us.

109
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,520
Inspector Shiratori did?

110
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,020
But what a coincidence...

111
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,020
to run into everyone in a place like this.

112
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,120
The mascot of Marine Land, Marilyn brought us here.

113
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,420
So that we could take a picture together.

114
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,120
See...

115
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,520
What? She's gone.

116
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,220
She disappeared.

117
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,920
Hey, Shiratori. This is Takano.

118
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,720
I made the kids join the two of them like you told me to.

119
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,020
Roger. Please continue watching them.

120
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,220
Hi, Inspector Shiratori.

121
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:11,020
Yes, thanks to you, we've all come to Marine Land.

122
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,420
Oh, the case the other day?

123
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,520
What? You have something you want me to verify?

124
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,220
Yes, I'm passing the area by car,

125
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,120
so I'd like to see you there.

126
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,720
You're coming here now?

127
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,520
No, no. Say no.

128
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,920
No. That's... Well...

129
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,520
I tell you what.

130
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,320
I'll send a fax to your residence now,

131
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,820
so please call me on my cell phone

132
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,120
after confirming it by 3 o'clock this afternoon.

133
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
Goodbye.

134
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,120
Hey...

135
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,120
We'll have to go home now, or we won't make it in time.

136
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,020
We'll take care of the children,

137
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,320
so you can leave them with us.

138
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,620
Is that so?

139
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,020
I guess I'll leave them with you then.

140
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,620
But Ms. Sato...

141
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,920
Don't worry.

142
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,020
If the worst comes to the worst,

143
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,220
we can always call Mr. Mouri or Ran.

144
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,420
No, that's not what I meant.

145
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,720
Neither Pops nor Ran could come today.

146
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,720
Pops is participating in a community baseball game

147
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,020
and Ran is cheering for him.

148
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,920
But they could've lost the first time around

149
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,120
and gone home already.

150
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,220
I don't think so.

151
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,120
Because Mr. Mouri was bragging that they're a really strong team

152
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,120
that made it to the semi-finals last year.

153
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,620
Right?

154
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,520
He was polishing his glove till it got glossy

155
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,420
and he was going all out.

156
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,720
Then, just as I thought...

157
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,220
Well, everything's fine.

158
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,820
The more the merrier in a place like this.

159
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,420
Okay, then.

160
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,020
All's well, at least for now.

161
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,820
We'll just have to wait and see what happens from here.

162
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,620
I'm going to take a rest,

163
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,520
so if any changes come up, be sure you let me know.

164
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,020
Yes, sir.

165
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,620
I stayed up all night finishing up work that I had on my hands

166
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,720
that I haven't slept.

167
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,020
And of course, be on guard for the case on the "deal" too.

168
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,420
Yes, sir!

169
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,520
What? 30 men to stake out on a drug deal?

170
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,620
Yes, sir. According to a tip,

171
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,920
the deal is to be held at Tropical Marine Land

172
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,720
by the dealer named Asakichi Yakura.

173
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,020
Oh, that big shot who's on the run

174
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,620
after committing three assault cases.

175
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,320
Is that tip reliable or what?

176
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,620
It's not misinformation, is it?

177
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,720
I'm sure it's real.

178
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,020
Inspector Shiratori is currently in charge at the site.

179
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,820
Don't worry.

180
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,120
God is on our side.

181
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,320
-So he says. -I see.

182
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,420
If he's that confident, then...

183
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,120
I guess everything will go well.

184
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,720
Miwako...

185
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,920
Hi!

186
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,720
Eels over rice!

187
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,020
Yahoo!

188
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,720
Hey, what kind of look is that?

189
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,820
I'm sorry.

190
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,120
But we were on a date and yet...

191
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,220
Don't be silly.

192
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,620
The world's not going to end today, is it?

193
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,720
Besides...

194
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,020
we can just consider this a rehearsal.

195
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,820
Of when we have a family of our own.

196
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,120
Ms. Sato...

197
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,220
Well, you know.

198
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,620
This is Sogawa.

199
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,420
They've entered a pretty dangerous mood now!

200
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,920
Inspector Shiratori!

201
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,320
Inspector, please wake up! It's an emergency!

202
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,520
This is not something...

203
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,420
all that great, but...

204
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,020
What is it?

205
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,320
Well...

206
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,420
What?

207
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,220
What is this?

208
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,020
What's in this paper bag?

209
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,420
That's not mine.

210
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,920
Come to think of it,

211
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,820
although this bag looks like mine, it seems to be a bit different.

212
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,520
Hey, this is...

213
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,620
a narcotic!

214
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,120
What?

215
00:13:01,928 --> 00:13:04,328
It's approximately 1 kilogram in weight.

216
00:13:04,328 --> 00:13:06,128
-What? -What is it? What is it?

217
00:13:06,128 --> 00:13:07,328
What's up?

218
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,928
Did you have that bag on you at all times?

219
00:13:11,628 --> 00:13:13,928
Come to think of it, I let go of it just once.

220
00:13:13,928 --> 00:13:17,128
Please wait a while more before we depart.

221
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:20,328
Please give your belongings to the person in charge

222
00:13:20,328 --> 00:13:22,928
because there is a danger that you may drop it.

223
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:24,428
Here.

224
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,728
That's right.

225
00:13:25,728 --> 00:13:29,128
It was when I rode the "50,000 Miles Under The Sea" attraction.

226
00:13:29,128 --> 00:13:31,128
I'm sure someone made a mistake back then

227
00:13:31,128 --> 00:13:33,128
and took my bag.

228
00:13:33,128 --> 00:13:35,128
Let's go check.

229
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:37,928
Maybe that person had come to get this bag.

230
00:13:38,828 --> 00:13:41,028
This is Shiratori. Is anything wrong?

231
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,628
Well, it seems like something has happened.

232
00:13:43,628 --> 00:13:46,328
Ms. Sato's expression has changed into a police officer's look.

233
00:13:46,328 --> 00:13:47,628
A police officer's look?

234
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:55,028
Inspector Shiratori sure is taking his time.

235
00:13:55,028 --> 00:13:57,928
I haven't heard a beep from my fax.

236
00:14:00,128 --> 00:14:01,528
"Central Information"

237
00:14:01,528 --> 00:14:03,228
What? Nobody came?

238
00:14:03,228 --> 00:14:07,328
No. No one came to deliver a bag like that.

239
00:14:07,328 --> 00:14:08,528
That's strange.

240
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:10,828
It's already been two hours since then.

241
00:14:10,828 --> 00:14:13,428
Could it be that he has already gone home?

242
00:14:13,428 --> 00:14:17,128
Right, there's only one bag after all.

243
00:14:17,128 --> 00:14:19,328
Maybe he didn't want it anymore.

244
00:14:19,328 --> 00:14:20,428
Don't be silly.

245
00:14:20,428 --> 00:14:21,628
That amount of drug

246
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:24,928
would add up to several dozen million yen.

247
00:14:24,928 --> 00:14:27,528
If he finds out that he has the wrong bag,

248
00:14:27,528 --> 00:14:29,928
he would go crazy looking around for it.

249
00:14:29,928 --> 00:14:32,128
-Several dozen million? -Several dozen million?

250
00:14:32,128 --> 00:14:34,528
The owner of the bag probably hasn't been told

251
00:14:34,528 --> 00:14:36,428
about what's in the bag,

252
00:14:36,428 --> 00:14:38,528
and is probably just a mule.

253
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:40,728
Otherwise, it's hard to imagine he would easily leave his bag behind

254
00:14:40,728 --> 00:14:42,828
and enjoy riding an attraction ride.

255
00:14:43,828 --> 00:14:47,728
Besides, he doesn't even seem to know that the bag had been switched.

256
00:14:47,728 --> 00:14:49,828
In other words, the deal has not been carried out.

257
00:14:49,828 --> 00:14:51,228
The deal's probably going to take place

258
00:14:51,228 --> 00:14:54,528
somewhere here in Marine Land soon, and the drug will be handed over.

259
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:57,528
Then, we've got to find that person quickly.

260
00:14:57,528 --> 00:15:00,428
But how do we look for him

261
00:15:00,428 --> 00:15:02,628
from among so many people?

262
00:15:05,928 --> 00:15:11,128
And if the content inside the bag is heroin,

263
00:15:11,128 --> 00:15:15,828
the dealer may be Asakichi Yakura who is on the run right now.

264
00:15:15,828 --> 00:15:20,228
Yes. He's a heroin dealer.

265
00:15:20,228 --> 00:15:24,228
We've also got information that he's in hiding in this area.

266
00:15:24,228 --> 00:15:26,128
What's this thing called "Heroin"?

267
00:15:26,128 --> 00:15:28,728
You know, the American festival in October

268
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:31,428
when everybody wears ghost and monster costumes!

269
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:33,928
That's Halloween.

270
00:15:33,928 --> 00:15:37,228
Heroin is a narcotic drug made from morphine.

271
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,728
And once you become addicted,

272
00:15:38,728 --> 00:15:40,928
you're attacked by unceasing bouts of agony

273
00:15:40,928 --> 00:15:43,228
and eventually become mentally deranged.

274
00:15:43,228 --> 00:15:45,328
It's an extremely dangerous drug.

275
00:15:45,328 --> 00:15:48,828
Anyway, the problem is how are we going to

276
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:50,628
identify this mule.

277
00:15:50,628 --> 00:15:53,628
The only clue we have is this bag.

278
00:15:53,628 --> 00:15:57,128
Besides the paper bag with the drug, the other content include

279
00:15:57,128 --> 00:16:00,828
are a brand new sports towel and a soiled handkerchief.

280
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:02,928
Isn't there anything on the bag

281
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:06,028
that indicates the characteristic or some kinds of habit of its owner?

282
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:08,228
Like a scratch, blood stains and such.

283
00:16:08,228 --> 00:16:10,428
No, nothing in particular.

284
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:13,428
Then, maybe we should just forget about it.

285
00:16:13,428 --> 00:16:15,028
There wasn't anything really important in your bag

286
00:16:15,028 --> 00:16:17,628
that was taken away, was there?

287
00:16:18,628 --> 00:16:21,028
On the contrary, there sure was!

288
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:22,728
The precious ring...

289
00:16:23,928 --> 00:16:26,328
I was planning to give Ms. Sato.

290
00:16:26,328 --> 00:16:28,728
You've got a clue!

291
00:16:28,728 --> 00:16:31,228
Look at the shoulder belt of that bag.

292
00:16:31,228 --> 00:16:34,428
Only the hole on the left side is spread out wide.

293
00:16:38,328 --> 00:16:39,528
He's right.

294
00:16:39,528 --> 00:16:41,328
That means that the owner

295
00:16:41,328 --> 00:16:43,728
always carried the bag on his left shoulder.

296
00:16:43,728 --> 00:16:45,228
If the owner carried it on his right shoulder,

297
00:16:45,228 --> 00:16:46,728
the hole of the shoulder belt on the right side

298
00:16:46,728 --> 00:16:48,528
should be spread out more.

299
00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:51,528
But what can you tell from that?

300
00:16:51,528 --> 00:16:53,928
Well, which side would you carry the bag on, Officer Takagi?

301
00:16:53,928 --> 00:16:55,828
I would carry it on the side that I feel comfortable with.

302
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:57,828
On the right.

303
00:16:57,828 --> 00:16:59,128
I see.

304
00:16:59,128 --> 00:17:02,128
A right-handed person would normally carry it on the right shoulder,

305
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:06,028
but the owner of that bag always carried it on his left shoulder.

306
00:17:06,028 --> 00:17:07,728
Which means

307
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:10,428
the possibility of him being left-handed is very high.

308
00:17:11,728 --> 00:17:14,828
And if a large sports towel is kept in the bag,

309
00:17:14,828 --> 00:17:16,528
he could be having a job where he sweats a lot

310
00:17:16,528 --> 00:17:19,728
or somebody who does sports.

311
00:17:19,728 --> 00:17:20,928
You're right.

312
00:17:20,928 --> 00:17:23,128
But how do we search

313
00:17:23,128 --> 00:17:24,828
when there are so many people here?

314
00:17:24,828 --> 00:17:27,228
If only we could have a picture...

315
00:17:30,628 --> 00:17:34,528
There were a lot of pictures pasted by the exit

316
00:17:34,528 --> 00:17:36,628
of the attraction "50,000 Miles Under The Sea".

317
00:17:36,628 --> 00:17:38,528
Yes, the people who got off the ride were gathering

318
00:17:38,528 --> 00:17:40,528
and looking at the pictures.

319
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:44,328
Aren't those the service pictures that's part of the attraction?

320
00:17:44,328 --> 00:17:46,328
The ones that are taken automatically

321
00:17:46,328 --> 00:17:48,028
at the peak of excitement

322
00:17:48,028 --> 00:17:50,128
and sold to anyone who wants them.

323
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,828
Come to think of it, something like a camera flash shined

324
00:17:53,828 --> 00:17:55,328
when we were riding it.

325
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:56,528
Yeah.

326
00:17:56,528 --> 00:18:00,228
The picture may still be there if we go now.

327
00:18:00,228 --> 00:18:02,728
This is the number to my cell phone.

328
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:03,928
Remember.

329
00:18:03,928 --> 00:18:06,628
If someone comes looking for a bag that looks a lot like this one,

330
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:08,428
call me right away.

331
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:09,428
Yes, madam.

332
00:18:10,328 --> 00:18:14,028
Try and buy time until we get here, okay?

333
00:18:14,028 --> 00:18:15,328
I understand.

334
00:18:27,628 --> 00:18:30,328
We're the police.

335
00:18:30,328 --> 00:18:32,128
Police officers?

336
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:35,928
What did the people who just came want?

337
00:18:35,928 --> 00:18:38,328
Well, that man seem to have his bag

338
00:18:38,328 --> 00:18:41,828
mistakenly taken away by someone else.

339
00:18:41,828 --> 00:18:43,228
The bag? Could it be...

340
00:18:43,228 --> 00:18:44,628
The one with the ring inside.

341
00:18:44,628 --> 00:18:46,928
That's why he looked so desperate.

342
00:18:46,928 --> 00:18:50,528
Excuse me. Did those people do something?

343
00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:52,028
What do you mean?

344
00:18:52,028 --> 00:18:54,828
Well, I heard them mentioning things

345
00:18:54,828 --> 00:18:56,328
like blood stains (same in pronunciation as "wedding" in Japanese)

346
00:18:56,328 --> 00:18:57,728
and heroin (similar in sound to "reception" in Japanese).

347
00:19:00,428 --> 00:19:02,628
Wedding...

348
00:19:02,628 --> 00:19:06,628
reception?

349
00:19:07,928 --> 00:19:08,928
Sir...

350
00:19:11,728 --> 00:19:14,528
Shiratori! This is an emergency!

351
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,528
They're getting married! A wedding reception!

352
00:19:17,528 --> 00:19:18,728
That Takagi!

353
00:19:18,728 --> 00:19:22,128
He just might get married here today!

354
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:25,428
Well, calm down

355
00:19:25,428 --> 00:19:27,128
and tell me what you have to say from the start.

356
00:19:29,028 --> 00:19:30,528
I see.

357
00:19:30,528 --> 00:19:33,528
So the bag with the ring in question

358
00:19:33,528 --> 00:19:36,828
was taken away by someone else by mistake?

359
00:19:36,828 --> 00:19:38,828
Then, all we have to do is get a hold of that bag

360
00:19:38,828 --> 00:19:40,528
before the two get to it

361
00:19:40,528 --> 00:19:43,428
to prevent the worst from happening.

362
00:19:43,428 --> 00:19:45,828
Dispatch all the officers at the site

363
00:19:45,828 --> 00:19:49,028
and find the person who has this bag and get him.

364
00:19:49,028 --> 00:19:51,828
Of course, I will be there too.

365
00:19:51,828 --> 00:19:54,728
"50,000 Miles Under The Sea"

366
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:58,028
There it is!

367
00:19:58,028 --> 00:20:00,428
This is it, our picture!

368
00:20:00,428 --> 00:20:04,628
The people who rode with us are

369
00:20:04,628 --> 00:20:05,828
five other people.

370
00:20:05,828 --> 00:20:10,028
Four, if we exclude the kid in the second seat from the rear.

371
00:20:10,028 --> 00:20:12,428
But with such a small picture,

372
00:20:12,428 --> 00:20:14,428
it's hard to tell whether someone is left-handed or not,

373
00:20:14,428 --> 00:20:17,228
let alone what kind of work or sports he does.

374
00:20:17,228 --> 00:20:20,128
Oh, but the man next to Genta

375
00:20:20,128 --> 00:20:23,528
was practicing golf swings while waiting.

376
00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:27,028
He seems to be right-handed, though.

377
00:20:27,028 --> 00:20:30,028
But since there are only a few golf clubs for left-handers,

378
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:34,028
many left-handed people may start with their right hand.

379
00:20:34,028 --> 00:20:35,428
I guess you're right.

380
00:20:35,428 --> 00:20:38,028
But the man who was behind me

381
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,828
is surely right-handed

382
00:20:39,828 --> 00:20:42,528
because I saw him doing this.

383
00:20:42,528 --> 00:20:44,328
So, he plays baseball.

384
00:20:45,528 --> 00:20:49,228
Come to think of it, the man in the very back plays soccer.

385
00:20:49,228 --> 00:20:52,428
Both his legs were suntanned.

386
00:20:52,428 --> 00:20:55,628
Most people who play soccer wear long socks,

387
00:20:55,628 --> 00:20:58,328
showing just a bit of the shin guard.

388
00:20:58,328 --> 00:21:02,528
Then, the woman beside the man must be a swimmer.

389
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:04,828
She had a white streak about 1 centimeter wide

390
00:21:04,828 --> 00:21:06,828
on the side of her eye that wasn't suntanned.

391
00:21:06,828 --> 00:21:10,028
It's probably because she's always wearing goggles, right?

392
00:21:11,428 --> 00:21:17,628
Golf, baseball, soccer and swimming.

393
00:21:17,628 --> 00:21:20,228
All of them use sports towels, don't they?

394
00:21:21,028 --> 00:21:23,228
But I can tell that the man right beside Genta

395
00:21:23,228 --> 00:21:25,728
is a really timid person.

396
00:21:25,728 --> 00:21:28,528
See. He was clinging onto Genta.

397
00:21:28,528 --> 00:21:31,128
Come to think of it, after he grabbed my shirt,

398
00:21:31,128 --> 00:21:33,628
there is a blue ink smear on it now.

399
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:37,128
Big sister, you were taking a survey

400
00:21:37,128 --> 00:21:40,128
using a blue ballpoint pen while we were waiting, right?

401
00:21:40,128 --> 00:21:41,328
Yes.

402
00:21:41,328 --> 00:21:43,528
Could you show us the survey sheets?

403
00:21:45,728 --> 00:21:47,028
"Genta Kojima"

404
00:21:47,928 --> 00:21:50,428
Here it is. This was taken right after Genta's,

405
00:21:50,428 --> 00:21:52,128
so there's no mistake about it.

406
00:21:52,128 --> 00:21:55,028
And this person is left-handed!

407
00:21:55,028 --> 00:21:57,028
How do you know?

408
00:21:57,028 --> 00:21:59,128
See, look closely.

409
00:21:59,128 --> 00:22:00,228
The characters written using the ballpoint pen

410
00:22:00,228 --> 00:22:01,728
smeared to the right.

411
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,128
This is proof that the person is left-handed.

412
00:22:04,128 --> 00:22:05,928
When he writes something sideways,

413
00:22:05,928 --> 00:22:08,528
he has to write the next character before the ink dries,

414
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:11,028
so it inevitably gets rubbed and stained to the right.

415
00:22:11,028 --> 00:22:12,928
After that, I think that the ink that was left on his hand

416
00:22:12,928 --> 00:22:16,628
rubbed off on Genta's shirt when he clung onto Genta.

417
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:18,528
I... I see.

418
00:22:20,828 --> 00:22:22,628
You... you're a police?

419
00:22:23,928 --> 00:22:25,428
Please announce his name on the survey sheet

420
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:27,228
and have him come here immediately!

421
00:22:27,228 --> 00:22:29,528
He's a major witness for an investigation!

422
00:24:31,955 --> 00:24:34,155
Next Conan's Hint:

423
00:24:34,155 --> 00:24:36,255
"Sportsman"

424
00:24:36,255 --> 00:24:37,555
What is this episode about?

425
00:24:37,555 --> 00:24:38,955
It was supposed to be about our date...

426
00:24:38,955 --> 00:24:40,955
-Officer Takagi. -I'm sorry.
