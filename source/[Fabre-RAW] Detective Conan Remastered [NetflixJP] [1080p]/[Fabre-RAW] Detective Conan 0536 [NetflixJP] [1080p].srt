1
00:00:04,948 --> 00:00:05,985
Hey.

2
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:10,648
There's a spooky mansion on 3rd street, right?

3
00:00:10,648 --> 00:00:14,548
You mean that abandoned house that no one lives in anymore?

4
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:16,848
Last night, I heard my mom say

5
00:00:16,848 --> 00:00:19,999
some strange man came out of nowhere and started living there.

6
00:00:20,248 --> 00:00:23,548
What? Is that haunted house?

7
00:00:23,548 --> 00:00:27,648
Since it looks so spooky, no one wants to go near it.

8
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,009
It seems we need to scout out that house,

9
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:32,011
like the police would.

10
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:34,348
It's our duty as the Youth Detective Squad!

11
00:00:34,348 --> 00:00:36,015
Roger!

12
00:00:39,148 --> 00:00:41,048
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

13
00:00:41,048 --> 00:00:43,748
Saturday nights are for mystery.

14
00:00:43,748 --> 00:00:45,548
Hidden in the famous painter's masterpiece.

15
00:00:45,548 --> 00:00:46,548
What's this astonishing mystery

16
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:48,027
you think you can see but can't?

17
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:49,248
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:00:49,248 --> 00:00:51,048
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

19
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:53,648
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

20
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:39,916
"The Secret of the Vanished Masterpiece"

21
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:41,716
It's really strange to think

22
00:02:41,716 --> 00:02:44,143
someone would purposely move into that kind of house.

23
00:02:44,316 --> 00:02:45,616
I'll say.

24
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:48,816
I'm actually more interested in the one residing in your house,

25
00:02:48,816 --> 00:02:52,916
rather than whoever in this haunted house.

26
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,616
You mean Subaru Okiya?

27
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,816
That guy's nothing to worry about.

28
00:02:57,816 --> 00:03:00,416
After all, he's a Holmes fan.

29
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:03,316
Pretty illogical, aren't you?

30
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:04,516
It's none of your business.

31
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:06,916
I can lend my house to whoever I want.

32
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,616
I suppose, but...

33
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,177
It's become pretty.

34
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:19,916
Looks like the one who moved in

35
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,181
took good care of the landscape, huh?

36
00:03:25,816 --> 00:03:28,816
I'm telling you, you're giving me a hard time.

37
00:03:28,816 --> 00:03:31,216
We agreed that today was the deadline, didn't we?

38
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:33,316
Two or three more days won't hurt.

39
00:03:33,316 --> 00:03:35,716
But we have our own schedules.

40
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,816
At any rate, I can only give you until tomorrow.

41
00:03:37,816 --> 00:03:39,916
I have my own concerns here!

42
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,201
Now, leave!

43
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:47,016
You can't... you had better keep your promise!

44
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:55,816
Beika Real Estate Company?

45
00:03:55,816 --> 00:03:58,216
Who are you, kids?

46
00:03:58,216 --> 00:03:59,616
What do you want from me?

47
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,221
No, well...

48
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:06,225
Say Pops, what's with your nameplate?

49
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:07,616
Nothing's written on it.

50
00:04:07,616 --> 00:04:10,216
It's true, there's no name.

51
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,816
I haven't placed a name on it yet.

52
00:04:12,816 --> 00:04:14,916
I can't.

53
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,616
Not yet.

54
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:21,316
Not putting his name on the plate, it sure is weird.

55
00:04:21,316 --> 00:04:24,243
Yeah, what could he be up to?

56
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:26,245
In such a huge mansion.

57
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:28,616
However, the next day...

58
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:31,016
What? That guy died?

59
00:04:31,016 --> 00:04:32,916
What happened?

60
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:36,016
It seems he wasn't in good health.

61
00:04:36,016 --> 00:04:38,257
He collapsed at home last night

62
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:41,516
and managed to call for an ambulance himself, but...

63
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:46,265
Although he was suspicious, I feel sorry for him.

64
00:04:46,516 --> 00:04:48,267
That's true.

65
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:51,016
But I wonder what he was planning to do after moving into

66
00:04:51,016 --> 00:04:52,271
that haunted mansion.

67
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:54,716
-Let's check it out. -What?

68
00:04:54,716 --> 00:04:56,916
Our minds won't be at ease, right?

69
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,316
With an unsolved mystery lingering.

70
00:05:00,816 --> 00:05:01,816
The neighbors say

71
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:04,283
they don't know much about that man.

72
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:08,616
Yeah, even though he moved in three months ago,

73
00:05:08,616 --> 00:05:11,016
he didn't acquaint himself with the neighbors.

74
00:05:11,016 --> 00:05:13,616
He seldom left the house, too!

75
00:05:13,616 --> 00:05:15,416
Everyone said he would always either stay inside

76
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,316
to fix up the house or go out to take care of the yard.

77
00:05:18,316 --> 00:05:20,816
Maybe he didn't have a job?

78
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:23,716
It's here.

79
00:05:23,716 --> 00:05:25,516
No doubt, it's here!

80
00:05:25,516 --> 00:05:27,316
Say, Pops.

81
00:05:27,316 --> 00:05:29,816
Are you an acquaintance of the man who lived here?

82
00:05:29,816 --> 00:05:32,616
You mean, you all knew the master, Mr. Wada?

83
00:05:32,616 --> 00:05:33,816
A master?

84
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:36,315
He was a master of some kind?

85
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:38,317
Yes, Master Rokuro Wada

86
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:41,516
was a famous Western-style painter representing Japan!

87
00:05:41,516 --> 00:05:44,323
So that guy was a painter, huh?

88
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:46,116
Then, you are, too?

89
00:05:46,116 --> 00:05:48,616
No. I'm an art dealer that has been handling

90
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:51,916
Master Wada's masterpieces for a long time.

91
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,016
He said he rented this mansion to use as

92
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:57,116
an art studio for painting a new masterpiece, so...

93
00:05:57,116 --> 00:06:00,116
There's no time for that, President!

94
00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:01,616
You're right.

95
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:05,116
If someone were to steal it, it would be tragic!

96
00:06:07,516 --> 00:06:10,916
Looks like this was a mystery easily solved.

97
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,616
About who that person was.

98
00:06:12,616 --> 00:06:14,916
And what he was doing here, at least.

99
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,355
If he was painting all the time,

100
00:06:16,516 --> 00:06:19,616
it's no wonder he never went out much.

101
00:06:19,616 --> 00:06:22,361
But, I wonder what kind of picture he was painting.

102
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:24,016
We really wanna see, right?

103
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:25,216
That's true...

104
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:26,716
Right?

105
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:32,016
Excuse us.

106
00:06:35,516 --> 00:06:36,816
This way!

107
00:06:44,816 --> 00:06:46,385
There's nothing here.

108
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:49,216
It's because it was only rented as an art studio.

109
00:06:49,216 --> 00:06:50,816
This house.

110
00:06:51,516 --> 00:06:53,216
Huh?

111
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:56,395
Conan!

112
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:59,616
Could this boy be that man when he was a child?

113
00:06:59,616 --> 00:07:01,716
Sure, looks like it.

114
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:03,416
What's going on, children?

115
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,403
No.

116
00:07:04,616 --> 00:07:07,516
We just wanted to see that man's paintings.

117
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:09,716
The thing is, we didn't find any,

118
00:07:09,716 --> 00:07:12,411
even after searching the other rooms and upstairs.

119
00:07:12,616 --> 00:07:15,216
Could it be that someone stole them?

120
00:07:15,216 --> 00:07:19,016
No, we didn't see any art supplies at all.

121
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:22,016
No easels, canvases, paint or brushes.

122
00:07:22,016 --> 00:07:23,916
-What? -Are you sure this really is

123
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,416
his art studio?

124
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:28,916
Yes, there's no doubt about it.

125
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:32,431
I finally found it. The perfect place!

126
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:33,616
I'm going to create

127
00:07:33,616 --> 00:07:38,116
a once-in-a-lifetime masterpiece there!

128
00:07:38,116 --> 00:07:40,816
Master did say that.

129
00:07:40,816 --> 00:07:43,116
Couldn't it be that he simply put his art supplies away

130
00:07:43,116 --> 00:07:46,016
-after he finished painting? -I see!

131
00:07:46,016 --> 00:07:47,916
Let's give it one more careful search!

132
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,916
Excuse me, Mr. Wada?

133
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,416
We're about to commence the deconstruction!

134
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,116
What is the meaning of this?

135
00:07:55,116 --> 00:07:56,455
What do you mean by what?

136
00:07:56,616 --> 00:07:59,716
This is the guy who was arguing with Mr. Wada yesterday!

137
00:07:59,716 --> 00:08:01,716
Arguing with Master?

138
00:08:01,716 --> 00:08:04,216
Where is Mr. Wada?

139
00:08:04,216 --> 00:08:05,316
He passed away.

140
00:08:05,316 --> 00:08:06,465
What?

141
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:08,467
Late last night.

142
00:08:08,716 --> 00:08:10,469
Lucky.

143
00:08:10,716 --> 00:08:12,471
Wait! What did you say?

144
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:15,116
Someone has died and you feel lucky?

145
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:17,916
Oh, I'm sorry.

146
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:23,616
I'm Shishikura, of Beika Real Estate.

147
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:26,016
In fact, our company

148
00:08:26,016 --> 00:08:28,487
purchased this land three months ago

149
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:30,116
and decided to demolish the building right away

150
00:08:30,116 --> 00:08:32,491
for other use, but...

151
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:34,493
That's when Mr. Wada came around.

152
00:08:34,716 --> 00:08:37,916
He said he wanted to rent this place for three months.

153
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:41,816
So, we agreed to rent it to him for just three months, but...

154
00:08:41,816 --> 00:08:44,216
You're not leaving? What do you mean?

155
00:08:44,216 --> 00:08:46,505
Something has come up and I've changed my plans.

156
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:48,507
Please give me two or three more days.

157
00:08:48,716 --> 00:08:51,116
But that's causing us problems, you know!

158
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:52,816
We already sold this land to another customer

159
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:54,513
and agreed to demolish this house immediately!

160
00:08:54,716 --> 00:08:57,716
I just need two or three days more.

161
00:08:57,716 --> 00:09:01,216
That's what he said, it really put me in a pickle.

162
00:09:01,216 --> 00:09:03,716
So, that's why they were fighting.

163
00:09:03,716 --> 00:09:07,916
But, since he's gone, so is the problem, right?

164
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,116
All right, everyone!

165
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:11,716
Carry out his belongings and start the demolition.

166
00:09:11,716 --> 00:09:15,016
Hold it! Please wait until we find the painting

167
00:09:15,016 --> 00:09:16,816
-that Master Wada was talking about. -Oh, no.

168
00:09:16,816 --> 00:09:19,916
Don't worry, we'll be quick.

169
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,116
You must be kidding.

170
00:09:21,116 --> 00:09:23,216
What do we do now, Mr. Shishikura?

171
00:09:23,216 --> 00:09:26,216
We'll just have to wait.

172
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:29,116
Let's help them find the painting as well!

173
00:09:29,116 --> 00:09:31,716
Sounds like fun, just like a treasure hunt.

174
00:09:31,716 --> 00:09:33,116
Let's, let's!

175
00:09:33,116 --> 00:09:35,516
-But... -Let's go!

176
00:09:37,816 --> 00:09:40,316
So, you're not going to look for it?

177
00:09:47,016 --> 00:09:48,567
It's Master Wada's final masterpiece.

178
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:51,516
Just think of the aesthetic value!

179
00:09:58,816 --> 00:10:02,581
I'd say it's futile, searching for the painting.

180
00:10:02,816 --> 00:10:04,583
Futile?

181
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:10,116
Conan!

182
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:15,716
Where on earth did Master Wada put his painting?

183
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:20,016
Conan?

184
00:10:20,016 --> 00:10:23,416
But, it's strange as well, this place.

185
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:24,616
If painting had been done here,

186
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:27,416
there should at least be a scent of paint.

187
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:30,616
But I can't smell anything like it.

188
00:10:30,616 --> 00:10:32,016
Now that you mention it.

189
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:37,116
It's true just like the boy says.

190
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:41,016
Perhaps Master Wada didn't paint anything here after all.

191
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:43,216
No painting?

192
00:10:43,216 --> 00:10:45,416
If that's it, the remaining mystery

193
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,627
revolves around why he rented the house.

194
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:52,216
Jeez, you can't even firmly refuse.

195
00:10:56,116 --> 00:10:58,637
So it looks like nothing come out.

196
00:10:58,637 --> 00:11:02,116
There was no painting to begin with, I suppose.

197
00:11:03,316 --> 00:11:04,643
Sorry to keep you waiting.

198
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:06,216
Now let's get started!

199
00:11:06,216 --> 00:11:08,416
We can finally get to work!

200
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:11,416
Yeah, let's get this over with!

201
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,657
Excuse me.

202
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:20,659
Where is Mr. Wada?

203
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,416
He passed away last night.

204
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,916
What?

205
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,516
Why are you looking for Master Wada?

206
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:32,016
We received a message from Mr. Wada a few days ago.

207
00:11:32,016 --> 00:11:35,916
"It'll be completed today, so please come see the painting", it said.

208
00:11:40,016 --> 00:11:41,916
Come see the painting?

209
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:44,683
Master Wada actually said that?

210
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:46,216
Yes.

211
00:11:46,216 --> 00:11:49,216
Four or five days ago. He mailed this.

212
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:53,216
Due to bad weather, it took longer than expected, but...

213
00:11:53,216 --> 00:11:56,416
I believe, it will be completed by this weekend.

214
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,116
Please be sure to bring Auntie here to see it.

215
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:00,699
Rokuro.

216
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:04,016
There is no doubt. This is Master Wada's handwriting!

217
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:08,216
Ms. Eguchi. That's your name, isn't it?

218
00:12:08,216 --> 00:12:10,416
Oh, yes.

219
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,416
What's Kafuen?

220
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:15,916
A retirement home. That's where I work.

221
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,516
What? A retirement home!

222
00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:23,016
Are you Ms. Saeko Takato?

223
00:12:23,016 --> 00:12:24,723
Do you know her?

224
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:25,916
As I suspected.

225
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:29,116
It's actually something I heard about from Master Wada.

226
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,516
He said he often visited your place as a child,

227
00:12:31,516 --> 00:12:33,816
and an auntie of his always took care of him.

228
00:12:33,816 --> 00:12:37,216
He said that the auntie is now in a retirement home.

229
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:41,916
Master Wada always took good care of me.

230
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:45,316
Ever since Ms. Takato's injury a year ago,

231
00:12:45,316 --> 00:12:48,116
she's been suffering from amnesia.

232
00:12:48,116 --> 00:12:49,516
What?

233
00:12:49,516 --> 00:12:52,751
She doesn't even remember who she is anymore.

234
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,755
Amnesia.

235
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:58,757
I'm sorry to hear that.

236
00:12:58,757 --> 00:12:59,816
But still, Mr. Wada

237
00:12:59,816 --> 00:13:02,761
would take time out of his busy schedule to visit.

238
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:05,116
Listen, dear auntie.

239
00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:09,916
I'm now working on a masterpiece I drew just for you!

240
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,316
How exciting, Ms. Takato.

241
00:13:12,316 --> 00:13:14,773
Please do bring it here when you're done.

242
00:13:15,016 --> 00:13:17,616
Well, it'd be impossible to bring it here.

243
00:13:17,616 --> 00:13:19,316
You'll have to come by.

244
00:13:19,316 --> 00:13:22,781
Does that mean it's a big project?

245
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:24,416
If you feast your eyes on it,

246
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,316
I'm sure you will regain your memories!

247
00:13:27,316 --> 00:13:29,916
The gate guarding your memories will swing right open!

248
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,716
I'm certain!

249
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:35,616
That means Master Wada

250
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:38,016
actually did work on his final piece in his house!

251
00:13:41,516 --> 00:13:43,416
Let's hurry and tear this house apart

252
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,216
to make up for our lost time!

253
00:13:53,689 --> 00:13:56,589
Hold on!

254
00:13:56,589 --> 00:13:58,817
Once more, let's search thoroughly!

255
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:00,189
Yes!

256
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:01,889
Hey, you two!

257
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:04,489
You couldn't find it anywhere, right?

258
00:14:04,489 --> 00:14:06,389
It's nowhere?

259
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:08,827
There must be!

260
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:11,989
Please wait! We can't have you going in there again!

261
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:13,989
What now, Mr. Shishikura?

262
00:14:13,989 --> 00:14:18,089
We wait. We can't proceed if there're people inside!

263
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:20,289
We have another construction site to get to!

264
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:22,841
Let's go grab some lunch!

265
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:25,589
No point arguing with a wimp like him!

266
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:28,847
That good for nothing.

267
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:31,389
And I thought we could finally get started.

268
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:35,289
Then, Ms. Takato, how about we wait here for a while?

269
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:38,089
Don't just stay and sit around!

270
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:39,489
What do you think?

271
00:14:39,489 --> 00:14:40,859
The painting?

272
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:45,189
You're not going to find anything

273
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:47,689
because he probably didn't draw anything to begin with.

274
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:49,889
What? What do you mean?

275
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,871
Do you mean he lied to his favorite auntie

276
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:56,289
who cared for him when he was little?

277
00:14:56,289 --> 00:14:58,389
I don't want to think that.

278
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:00,089
If it wasn't for working on a painting,

279
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:03,789
what reason did he have for renting this haunted mansion?

280
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:06,885
So, back to that mystery again.

281
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:08,887
It looks like all he did was fix the house

282
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:10,889
and take care of the yard.

283
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:12,891
That's right.

284
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:17,289
Just up ahead if I remember correctly.

285
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:18,897
Mitsuhiko?

286
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,989
The kids have finally gone home!

287
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:27,989
It's time for us to go.

288
00:15:27,989 --> 00:15:30,089
But the painting...

289
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:34,913
It's bright and sunny today,

290
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:38,289
so let's walk slowly over to the station.

291
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:46,089
-What the heck is it? -Beika Bank.

292
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:47,889
That guy was trying to dig a tunnel

293
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:49,989
from that mansion to here!

294
00:15:49,989 --> 00:15:51,489
A tunnel?

295
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:52,931
He tried to steal his way

296
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:55,389
into the underground deposit vault!

297
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:57,589
As expected, an underground tunnel.

298
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,489
From that mansion to this bank,

299
00:15:59,489 --> 00:16:02,589
the direct distance is only about 50m.

300
00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:04,589
If he were to dig 60cm a day,

301
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,945
three months would be enough!

302
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:08,947
He dug away during the night.

303
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:09,989
And then, during the day,

304
00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:12,951
he would bring up the dirt and deposit it in the garden.

305
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:16,189
By doing that, he could make it appear as if he was gardening.

306
00:16:16,189 --> 00:16:18,489
He was fixing up the house too, you know?

307
00:16:18,489 --> 00:16:19,989
Merely camouflage.

308
00:16:19,989 --> 00:16:22,489
It wouldn't look natural if he only worked in the yard.

309
00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:24,963
-However... -Not only that.

310
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:27,489
Well, it'd be impossible to bring it here.

311
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:29,389
You'll have to come by.

312
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:32,189
If he were stealing billions of yen,

313
00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:34,289
it sure would be impossible to carry around!

314
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:36,089
If you feast your eyes on it,

315
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:38,989
I think even you will regain your memories, Auntie!

316
00:16:38,989 --> 00:16:41,289
There's no one out there who wouldn't be shocked

317
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:43,789
feasting their eyes on billions of yen!

318
00:16:44,789 --> 00:16:47,489
He was referring to shocking her out of her amnesia!

319
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:48,987
That's what he meant!

320
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:52,189
Perfect, Mitsuhiko!

321
00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:56,789
It made my head spin.

322
00:16:56,789 --> 00:16:58,589
Let's find the entrance to the tunnel!

323
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:00,089
Yes!

324
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:03,001
The kids are back.

325
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:05,389
So, that man went as far as to fight the real estate agent

326
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:07,389
in order to keep staying here.

327
00:17:07,389 --> 00:17:10,089
Don't go in, never again.

328
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:11,689
This is the storage cabinet.

329
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:13,589
But it's not connected to the basement.

330
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,013
That means he could have torn up some of the wooden flooring

331
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:17,389
and dug under there, right?

332
00:17:17,389 --> 00:17:20,689
So! We should go check if there's a void under the floor.

333
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:23,389
Not in this room, it looks like.

334
00:17:23,389 --> 00:17:25,689
Let's try elsewhere!

335
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:29,027
Boy, they sure are noisy.

336
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:31,389
Stop making messes.

337
00:17:31,389 --> 00:17:33,031
What?

338
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:35,589
At Aunt Saeko's House?

339
00:17:38,589 --> 00:17:40,289
Could it be...

340
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:43,589
No, if I think of it this way, it all...

341
00:17:43,589 --> 00:17:47,789
Chief! Something strange has come up.

342
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:51,049
And because of it, we couldn't...

343
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:54,289
All right.

344
00:17:56,189 --> 00:17:59,057
Time's up! We've gotta move to the next site!

345
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:01,989
But, what about the demolition of this house?

346
00:18:01,989 --> 00:18:05,589
Why don't you do it yourself?

347
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:10,289
Why is it always like this?

348
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:14,589
This house is to blame for everything!

349
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:21,789
So, this house really was...

350
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:24,589
I think it's where you used to live.

351
00:18:24,589 --> 00:18:30,489
I wonder if I lived in such a beautiful house like this.

352
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:33,089
Since you lost your husband quite early in life,

353
00:18:33,089 --> 00:18:35,489
you apparently had a pretty rough time, but...

354
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:41,989
Before that, I heard you were very wealthy and happy.

355
00:18:41,989 --> 00:18:43,489
Well...

356
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:46,389
Memories from the past when she was happy...

357
00:18:46,389 --> 00:18:49,107
So that's what it was!

358
00:18:56,089 --> 00:18:59,117
I'll burn it down to ashes!

359
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:05,789
What the heck are you doing?

360
00:19:05,789 --> 00:19:08,389
Stop doing foolish things!

361
00:19:08,389 --> 00:19:11,129
What if the fire were to spread to the rest of the neighborhood?

362
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:13,789
I'm sorry. But please understand.

363
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:15,133
I have my reasons!

364
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:18,689
Just one more day! Wait until tomorrow.

365
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:20,289
Please!

366
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:33,689
What happened to him?

367
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:35,989
It seems like he's willing to wait one more day

368
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:37,155
to tear down the house.

369
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:40,889
It's okay to bring the house down immediately.

370
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:44,289
There was no painting anywhere, after all.

371
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:46,189
And no underground tunnels either.

372
00:19:46,189 --> 00:19:47,989
Figures.

373
00:19:47,989 --> 00:19:50,389
Because the reason that man rented this house was...

374
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:53,171
So that he could work on something for his auntie, Ms. Takato,

375
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:56,689
a once-in-a-lifetime masterpiece.

376
00:19:56,689 --> 00:19:59,589
Did you find it?

377
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:01,789
It's still in progress.

378
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:04,289
I think it'll be completed by tomorrow.

379
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:05,789
Tomorrow?

380
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:07,489
It'll be complete?

381
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:10,489
Because the weather's nice today.

382
00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:15,189
"The next day"

383
00:20:20,189 --> 00:20:23,201
As I thought, it really is entirely complete.

384
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:26,089
What is this? It's beautiful!

385
00:20:31,489 --> 00:20:33,689
It wasn't a painting.

386
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:36,689
A gorgeous sea of flower flooding around the garden.

387
00:20:36,689 --> 00:20:38,589
This is the masterpiece Mr. Wada

388
00:20:38,589 --> 00:20:41,889
had worked on for three months.

389
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:49,227
This view is the masterpiece.

390
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:53,231
Due to bad weather, it took extra time to complete.

391
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:57,235
So that's why he asked for more days.

392
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,237
Ms. Takato?

393
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:02,389
I know this place!

394
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:11,249
Flowers blooming around the garden, and swaying in the wind.

395
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:14,289
Over there was this mansion.

396
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:19,889
My husband stood beside me and I was always smiling.

397
00:21:19,889 --> 00:21:24,289
The always cute Roku, my nephew, often came over to play.

398
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:27,265
Roku lost his mother when he was still young,

399
00:21:27,489 --> 00:21:32,089
so he viewed me as his mother after that.

400
00:21:32,089 --> 00:21:34,589
Ms. Takato, could it be...

401
00:21:34,589 --> 00:21:37,275
I remember! Everything.

402
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:41,289
The gate to her memories opened?

403
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:44,589
So that's why it had to be here.

404
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:48,389
At this house that is very similar to auntie's house.

405
00:21:48,389 --> 00:21:50,389
It couldn't be anywhere else.

406
00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:51,989
I've got it.

407
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:56,789
The nameplate was meant to be his signature.

408
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:58,289
Signature?

409
00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:01,299
That's why he didn't display his nameplate.

410
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:03,301
Not until the flowers bloomed.

411
00:22:03,301 --> 00:22:05,303
Because the painting of the painter

412
00:22:05,303 --> 00:22:08,889
is never signed until after his piece is complete.

413
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:11,309
That's how it is!

414
00:23:34,689 --> 00:23:36,489
I guess it's all gone.

415
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:38,589
The haunted house, and the garden.

416
00:23:38,589 --> 00:23:40,489
Such a waste, huh?

417
00:23:40,489 --> 00:23:44,189
But, that man's wish finally reached his auntie,

418
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,989
-so it's all right! -You're right!

419
00:23:46,989 --> 00:23:48,189
That's true!

420
00:23:48,189 --> 00:23:51,189
-Well, we're gonna be late! -Yes!

421
00:23:51,189 --> 00:23:52,789
Hey, hold on a second!

422
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:55,789
Don't leave me behind, you guys!

423
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:04,238
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:24:04,238 --> 00:24:05,423
"A warning letter"
