1
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,100
Today's case is hard to take in.

2
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,700
It may not be right,

3
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,700
but a person's warmth is hard to erase.

4
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,300
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,100
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,900
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,410
Conan, what do you want to eat tonight?

8
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,350
We had fish last night, so tonight let's have...

9
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,220
Right! Let's have meat!

10
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:11,750
Huh!

11
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,620
-Meat! Meat! -Hello, there!

12
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,560
I thought we had meat just the other day.

13
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,300
Let's see... Conan!

14
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,660
Coming!

15
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,260
Ran are you sure we re eating expensive steak like this tonight?

16
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,570
Of course not...
Ran...

17
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,510
I thought so...
Come on...
You're Ran, aren't you...?

18
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,980
Sachiko...

19
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,640
Ran... who is she?

20
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,850
Remember?
Back when I dropped my student pass?

21
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,980
She the one who found it and delivered it to me.

22
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,120
Oh, she's the one.

23
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,990
There... How's this...

24
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,120
Yes. I'll take it.

25
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,660
You're the one

26
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,960
who bought that high grade expensive steak meat a while ago...

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,930
Conan. Stop that, will you?

28
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,900
But that wine sure looks super expensive...

29
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,200
You see, today is a special day.
But that wine sure looks super expensive...

30
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,400
You see, today is a special day.

31
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,410
My lover's coming over.

32
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,990
Really?

33
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,370
Sachiko is a super career woman.

34
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,000
I didn't think she was interested at all in men,

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,800
but I'm surprised she has a boyfriend.

36
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,010
Somebody that she can cook for...

37
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,680
Ran.

38
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,470
You have people you can cook for too, Ran.

39
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,600
But Shinichi hasn't been home at all.

40
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,480
No, I meant Pops and me.

41
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,270
Right!

42
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,780
However, the following day...

43
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,990
She was killed?

44
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,700
She was living alone.

45
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,870
Sachiko!

46
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:05,010
"Illusionary Spring Lover"

47
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,300
"Nishimura"

48
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,890
Mr. Mouri, this is not a case where we need you

49
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,180
to have come all the way here.

50
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,810
My daughter owes her a lot.

51
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,190
I'd like to at least be informed of the circumstances.

52
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,480
The body was found by

53
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,770
a colleague of hers that had doubts about her not coming to work

54
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,610
without reporting her absence, came to visit her.

55
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,990
The cause of death is a fractured skull

56
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,910
from a sharp blow on the back of her head.

57
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,780
The weapon is a bronze figurine that was found in the room.

58
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,580
The estimated time of her death is last night from 7:30 pm to 8 pm.

59
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,290
In the middle of dinner...

60
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,880
Was Sachiko a smoker?

61
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,590
If not, this side is Sachiko's seat

62
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,100
and the other side is the seat of her guest who was a smoker.

63
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,890
It's no doubt that someone such as her boyfriend came to visit her.

64
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,100
At about 7:30 pm,

65
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,890
The woman living next door heard

66
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,190
Ms. Nishimura talking to her boyfriend.

67
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,190
Promise that you'll take me with you next time.

68
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,690
It's not fair that you go to see

69
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,780
such a wonderful scenery all by yourself.

70
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,780
Maybe I over cooked the steak.

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It seems that her boyfriend's hobby was mountain climbing.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,210
We found this picture here.

73
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,010
Her boyfriend's probably responsible for this crime.

74
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,680
Why?

75
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,100
If someone came in and attacked Sachiko all of a sudden,

76
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,810
where did her boyfriend disappear to

77
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,810
without even reporting the incident to the police?

78
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,480
Well...

79
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,690
True.

80
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,280
Like I was saying, it's not an incident that calls for your help.

81
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,200
The police thinks that her boyfriend is the killer, too?

82
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,070
There is no other possibility taking into consideration the circumstances.

83
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,080
Takagi here.

84
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,870
None? Not even one?

85
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,710
All right.

86
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,590
It's from the forensic officer.

87
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,590
They found no fingerprints what so ever

88
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,090
other than that of Ms. Sachiko Nishimura from the bronze figurine

89
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,090
that is thought to be the murder weapon,

90
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:16,100
the picture of the mountain, or the wine glass

91
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,100
that they both were thought to have toasted with.

92
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,180
No fingerprints left?

93
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,690
No traces of them being wiped off either.

94
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,190
If so, this is a carefully planned homicide.

95
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,900
He came to visit her after he made sure that

96
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,570
no fingerprints would be left behind.

97
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,790
Promise that you'll take me with you next time.

98
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,010
Maybe I over cooked the steak.

99
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,180
And a while after they began eating...

100
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,310
He made Sachiko get up from her seat.

101
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,400
Why?

102
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,110
Why do you say it's her boyfriend that did that?

103
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,780
He was after her money.

104
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,200
There is nothing valuable

105
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,070
such as money and jewelry anywhere in sight.

106
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,410
That's hard to believe, isn't it, Conan?

107
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:25,080
Because Sachiko looked so happy yesterday, didn't she?

108
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,290
Today is a special day.

109
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,670
My lover's coming over.

110
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:34,880
That boyfriend...

111
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,090
couldn't have killed her!

112
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,470
Right, Conan?

113
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,470
Yes.

114
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:46,600
If so then, Ran, where did that man disappear to?

115
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,270
It's strange that he left no fingerprints behind either.

116
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,200
Something doesn't feel right.

117
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,070
I wonder what it is?

118
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,200
I confirmed with a colleague of hers.

119
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,290
I was told that she started going with her boyfriend

120
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,500
about six months ago.

121
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,580
However, it seemed that he was really busy or something

122
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:12,000
that he only came to visit her on the 25th of each month.

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,590
So, it seemed that Ms. Nishimura

124
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:18,380
always seemed excited from morning on the 25th.

125
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,890
Yesterday was also the 25th.

126
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,970
I wonder if there's any meaning to the fact

127
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:28,310
that he only comes to visit her on the 25th of each month?

128
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,190
It seems that even that colleague though,

129
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,610
was never told what her boyfriend's name was.

130
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,070
Which means we have no clue what so ever?

131
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,570
I went to visit her best friend since her school days

132
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,780
who lives nearby too, but...

133
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,580
No way! Sachiko was?

134
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,210
I just swung at air.

135
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:54,500
She didn't even know she had a boyfriend.

136
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,300
She hid the fact from her best friend?

137
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,880
Why?

138
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,680
At any rate, it's her boyfriend did it, Ran.

139
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,390
We'll try to crack who the killer is

140
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,900
from among her acquaintances as soon as possible.

141
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,770
Yeah, please do so.

142
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,490
I'll try and trace what the victim did yesterday.

143
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,490
Maybe I'll get a lead to her boyfriend.

144
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,700
Yes, sir.

145
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,700
Now that they know who the killer is,

146
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,790
I guess there's no role for a detective to play.

147
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,210
Let's go home.

148
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,380
Officer Takagi!

149
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,380
Please let me go with you.

150
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,010
I just can't believe that her boyfriend is the killer.

151
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,680
Ran.

152
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,690
What?

153
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,280
You saw Ms. Nishimura's boyfriend come running out?

154
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,780
Yes. I think it was around 8 pm last night.

155
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:17,590
But, how did you know that the man was Ms. Nishimura's boyfriend?

156
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:21,380
I think it was on the 25th of last month.

157
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,180
There was a big fire.

158
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,810
My apartment is right opposite Ms. Nishimura's condo.

159
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,310
When I happened to look out casually...

160
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:38,270
You mean the man that you saw a month ago during the fire

161
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,610
was the same man who came running out last night?

162
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,400
His eyes were blood-shot, and he ran like he was lurching forward.

163
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,070
Excuse me. May I have your name, please?

164
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,580
Me? I'm Suenaga.

165
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,700
Mr. Suenaga.

166
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,710
Will you help us make a composite picture of that man?

167
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,580
Okay.

168
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,790
But let me go tell the boss.

169
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,380
There's even eye-witness.

170
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,390
I guess this is it.

171
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,680
Ran.

172
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,390
With a composite picture in hand,

173
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,390
if they go asking around the vicinity where the victim lived,

174
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:17,190
it's just a matter of time before they find the killer.

175
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,980
But there's something that bothers me.

176
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,610
I wonder what it is.

177
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,490
It's about time!

178
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,790
What's the matter? Eat, you guys.

179
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,370
Okay.

180
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,790
Conan?

181
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,000
What? Yes.

182
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,800
What?

183
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,590
-Good? -It's really good.

184
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,890
I'm glad.

185
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,970
What's this? Did you make me check to see if it was okay or what?

186
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,890
No, it's not that.

187
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,980
But I wasn't sure if it was seasoned enough.

188
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,610
Ran, Sachiko must have been really hungry.

189
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,900
Why?

190
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,410
Because the steak and salad on her side of the table were eaten,

191
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,990
but her boyfriend's side was untouched.

192
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,500
So what, you brat?

193
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,300
Not possible.

194
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,590
That's strange, really strange.

195
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,300
What's so strange?

196
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,590
Maybe...

197
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,100
But...

198
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,970
The woman living next door heard

199
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,310
Ms. Nishimura talking to her boyfriend.

200
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,980
She only heard Sachiko's voice.

201
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,400
Yeah. If that's how it was,

202
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,900
it's understandable that there were no other fingerprints.

203
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:50,700
If so, why did she put on such an act?

204
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,580
Hey, what's up with you all of a sudden?

205
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,790
I'm going with her because I'm kind of worried!

206
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,290
Hey! You too?

207
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm going to eat all this up, you know?

208
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,670
Like I told the officer,

209
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,180
I really never heard that she had a boyfriend.

210
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,390
She did have one before though.

211
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,890
She did... before?

212
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,680
About 5 years ago.

213
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,270
A man called Mr. Henmi, whose hobby was mountain climbing.

214
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,110
"Henmi"

215
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,610
When was this?

216
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,400
About 6 months ago.

217
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,910
Was it on the 25th, 6 months ago?

218
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:39,210
Right! It was my husband's pay day.

219
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,000
Just as I thought.

220
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,090
What? Wait...

221
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,590
The real killer is not her boyfriend?

222
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:52,010
It's impossible for Sachiko's boyfriend to have killed her.

223
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,590
That's totally impossible!

224
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:56,010
Totally impossible...

225
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:00,600
If it wasn't her boyfriend,

226
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,310
then the real killer is none other than that person.

227
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,500
Mr. Izaki?

228
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,500
Yes. And who are you?

229
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,590
There's something I'd like to ask you.

230
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,700
-Mr. Suenaga. -Yes?

231
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,700
About this composite picture...

232
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,660
I can't remember anything more in detail than that.

233
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:57,380
No. It was impossible to make a composite picture to begin with.

234
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,670
What?

235
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,090
Because there was no boyfriend

236
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:06,180
that could've come to Ms. Nishimura at all.

237
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,180
Because...

238
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,980
This is strange.

239
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,270
If she prepared this for a boyfriend that she was seeing after a month,

240
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,770
first, her boyfriend would take a bite,

241
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:23,570
and she would wait for him to say something about her cooking.

242
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,280
It's only natural for her to start eating

243
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,570
after hearing what he had to say.

244
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,370
It's unthinkable for a woman

245
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,000
to start eating and drinking before her guest.

246
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:40,090
In other words, nobody came to visit her last night.

247
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:43,590
Then, why is everything prepared for two?

248
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,800
It's for her boyfriend.

249
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,470
I don't know what you're talking about.

250
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:52,260
Ms. Nishimura happily told her colleagues and Ran

251
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,980
that her boyfriend was going to come visit her.

252
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,690
But that was...

253
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,270
A lie!

254
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,580
Promise that you'll take me with you next time.

255
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,000
It's not fair that you go to see such a wonderful scenery all by yourself.

256
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,900
Maybe I over cooked the steak.

257
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,400
She acted the whole thing out herself.

258
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,300
There can be no other explanation for this.

259
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,500
He wasn't there to begin with,

260
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,600
so of course, there would be no fingerprints.

261
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,600
You, Mr. Suenaga said that

262
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,300
you saw someone that didn't even come to visit her.

263
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,100
And you even helped make up something like this

264
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:56,300
to divert our attention from the real killer! You!

265
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,900
Why would I need to do something like that?

266
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,600
You have a friend named Mr. Izaki, don't you?

267
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,300
The owner of the liquor shop told us about him

268
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,100
and we went to see him.

269
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,300
I hear that you were complaining last month

270
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,000
that a shopper who patronized your shop,

271
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
a woman who lived in the condo opposite you

272
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
refused when you asked her to go out with you.

273
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,500
You held a grudge against her because she brushed you off.

274
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
Isn't that right?

275
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,800
That's your motive for killing her.

276
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,500
Where's the evidence that I did it?

277
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,400
You borrowed money from Mr. Izaki, didn't you?

278
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,000
But you returned the total amount to him this morning.

279
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,800
Fingerprints were found on all the bills.

280
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,800
Your fingerprints as well as Ms. Nishimura's.

281
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,700
You killed her, holding a grudge against her for brushing you off

282
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,100
and stole cash as well as valuables from her.

283
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,800
Am I wrong?

284
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,000
Exactly.

285
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,500
But officer, that woman was a liar!

286
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,400
How dare she lie!

287
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,900
"The 25th a month ago"

288
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,500
I'm sorry. I can't go out with you.

289
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,100
I have a boyfriend.

290
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,800
He's coming today again, too.

291
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,700
I thought that it couldn't be helped then.

292
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,200
But that night!

293
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,900
Her boyfriend wasn't with her!

294
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,800
She bought wine again yesterday,

295
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,170
saying that her boyfriend was coming.

296
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,880
I went to check it out yesterday!

297
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,600
Please, no!

298
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,270
Please leave! Because he's coming!

299
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,270
Where is he? This boyfriend of yours?

300
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,190
I'm calling the police!

301
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,500
It's your fault for lying to me.

302
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,590
She didn't even have a boyfriend, but put on a front of having one!

303
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,000
If she wanted to just put on a front,

304
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,380
wouldn't it have been enough for her just to by steak for two?

305
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,090
She wouldn't have had to really cook the steak

306
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,800
or pour the wine into the glass, right?

307
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,970
Well...

308
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,390
It was a lie, but not really a lie.

309
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,480
Yesterday, her boyfriend really did visit her

310
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,480
and he probably sat down in that chair.

311
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,360
Her boyfriend called Mr. Henmi.

312
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,870
"Kawamura" -Sachiko had a boyfriend...

313
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:02,370
during her school days called Mr. Henmi.

314
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,870
But five years ago...

315
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:13,170
I'll be fine. I'll be back on the 25th.

316
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,300
The 25th?

317
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,590
I'll prepare a nice meal and wait for you then.

318
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:21,390
I'd like steak then. A thick one like this!

319
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,770
But Mr. Henmi never returned.

320
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,980
His body wasn't found either.

321
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,570
But 6 months ago, 5 years later...

322
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:38,280
Mr. Henmi's knapsack was found in the mountains.

323
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:43,280
And inside the knapsack, they found films that were already developed.

324
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,660
I had second thoughts about showing this to you after 5 years.

325
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,580
But I thought that he would've liked for you to see it, too.

326
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,000
Mr. Henmi came home.

327
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:00,470
Just as he promised on the 25th.

328
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,470
It was on the 25th, 6 months ago.

329
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,600
Since then, on the 25th of each month,

330
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,900
Mr. Henmi visited her.

331
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,900
In Sachiko's heart, even last night.

332
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,200
She decided to believe in him and wait.

333
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,660
She believed that by doing so, he would return.

334
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,000
That her boyfriend would never betray her.

335
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,600
Ran.

336
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,600
Which means for these past 6 months on the 25th,

337
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,560
she was talking all by herself?

338
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,400
I just said she wasn't alone!

339
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,200
Ran.

340
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,370
I'm sure that Shinichi will come back one day, too.

341
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:32,500
Thank you, Conan.

342
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,580
He'll open that door and say, "Hey, Ran!"

343
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:39,590
If he does...

344
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,670
Hey, Shinichi! Where and what were you doing till now?

345
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,470
The first thing I'll do is spin kick him!

346
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,880
What?

347
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,600
She has no intention of welcoming me kindly.

348
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,770
Not only will I spin kick him! I'll do a heel-drop.

349
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,770
I'm training for that time!

350
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,480
I don't think I'll be coming home for a while yet.

351
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:49,200
Next Conan's Hint:

352
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,280
"Daypack"

353
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,580
The next episode involves two police officers.

354
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,490
A date ought to be planned, right?

355
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:55,870
I wonder about that.
