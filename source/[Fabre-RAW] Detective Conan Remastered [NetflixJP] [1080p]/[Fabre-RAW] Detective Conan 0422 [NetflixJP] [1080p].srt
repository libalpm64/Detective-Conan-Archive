1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,380
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,480
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,180
Only a little more to go before sundown.

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,280
Will Dr. Agasa be able to meet his ginkgo colored first love?

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,680
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,280
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,280
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:03,190
A letter of 40 years ago comes out of Dr. Agasa's room.

9
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,390
The letter from Dr. Agasa's first love,

10
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,090
said that she would like to meet him every 10 years

11
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,490
at the place memorable for both of them.

12
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,490
A code and numbers that seem to indicate the place

13
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,790
"The Hint Is: Animal" -were also written.

14
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,390
It coincidentally turns out that today is that day 40 years ago,

15
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,190
so after making deductions

16
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,490
we headed for the zoo.

17
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,790
Hey, look good and hard.

18
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,690
Yes. She's sure to be here somewhere.

19
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,290
Dr. Agasa's first love.

20
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,790
Hey, you guys...

21
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,290
Hey, I wonder what that number is?

22
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,790
See, the number that is written on the name plate of the animals.

23
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,990
-Flying squirrel! -Flying squirrel!

24
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,190
Dr. Agasa, there's someone there.

25
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,790
She seems to be waiting for someone.

26
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:03,090
"Ginkgo-Colored First Love (Part 2)"

27
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,290
"Nocturnal Animals Building"

28
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,590
Dr. Agasa, there's someone there.

29
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,090
She seems to be waiting for someone.

30
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,290
She's not wearing a hat, but I'm sure it's her.

31
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,990
See. You're meeting her after 40 years,

32
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,290
so go do your thing.

33
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,290
Yeah.

34
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,890
Excuse me, but are you...

35
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,790
What, it's you, Mr. Hiroshi?

36
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,590
Oh! A man?

37
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,090
Long time no see. How've you been?

38
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,590
Who could you be?

39
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,290
No, did you forget me?

40
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,290
You used to come to my house a lot to look at my hamster.

41
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,190
Don't tell me that you're Mr. Haruo Chono?

42
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,990
I'm so happy that you remember me.

43
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,890
You took me for someone else, didn't you?

44
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:03,890
Yeah...

45
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,490
Because back then you were a boy with runny nose,

46
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,090
six years younger than me.

47
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,690
Oh, come off it!

48
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,890
I guess it's not her...

49
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,490
Right...

50
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,590
And, what brings you here today?

51
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,690
Oh, come on, silly.

52
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,490
What else but waiting for my boyfriend to come.

53
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,990
He likes squirrels and mice too.

54
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:25,590
That's why we're meeting in front of these flying squirrels.

55
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,590
I see, wrong person again.

56
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,490
But, if she's somewhere in this zoo,

57
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,790
I'm sure he'll get to see her eventually.

58
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:39,690
Wait... We don't have time to be talking like that.

59
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,490
There's only a little over an hour before sunset.

60
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,790
Then, we've got no other choice

61
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,790
than for the Sleeping Kogoro or the noisy Sonoko

62
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,090
to solve this for us.

63
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,490
Can't you get a hold of them?

64
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,890
Pops is at a live, so it's impossible.

65
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:57,890
Sonoko is with Ran, so I can get a hold of her but...

66
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,790
Then please call her.

67
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,790
Because if he misses today,

68
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,490
he won't get to see her for the next 10 years.

69
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,690
I think it won't help to call, though...

70
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,890
Yes, hello?

71
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,390
Oh? Conan.

72
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:17,290
Yes, we're still in line to buy Fusae Brand limited edition goods.

73
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,290
Is Sonoko there?

74
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,290
She went off to buy hamburgers so she's not here.

75
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,190
It's okay if she's not there. Bye.

76
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,390
She's not there...

77
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,790
What?

78
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,190
No...

79
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,490
Ran!

80
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,990
Here, I bought it!

81
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,890
What? You got a phone call?

82
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,390
What?

83
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,490
It's your hubby, isn't it?

84
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,090
What? No, it was Conan! From Conan!

85
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,090
Honest!

86
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,390
Conan just called me asking for you.

87
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,190
What? What?

88
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,790
He said, it's okay if you're not around...

89
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,990
Do you want to call him back?

90
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,590
Never mind. Getting involved with him only brings trouble.

91
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,890
Besides, it's kind of unusual that you want

92
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,790
to buy brand name goods, Ran.

93
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,690
Yeah, a little.

94
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,690
I made a promise with someone in the past.

95
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,490
I promised some time ago so.

96
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,090
I think that person already forgot, though.

97
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,890
"Nocturnal Animals Building" -Ms. Kinoshita! Ms. Kinoshita!

98
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,990
Mr. Agasa is waiting for you,

99
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,990
please come to the Nocturnal Animals Building immediately.

100
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,890
She doesn't seem to be here.

101
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,290
I see. I'm sorry to bother you.

102
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,890
That was our last resort.

103
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,990
Dr. Agasa. Can't you remember anything yet?

104
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,390
This zoo is a memorable place for you, isn't it?

105
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,790
No... I've come here for the first time.

106
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,190
What? Didn't you come here with the girl who wrote this postcard?

107
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,790
No... She wanted to come here, though.

108
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,290
In other words, this place was not the right place to begin with.

109
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,690
Why didn't you tell us so to begin with?

110
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,890
I'm sorry. You were all trying so hard so.

111
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,790
But, you've done enough already.

112
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,790
-What? -I'm contented.

113
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,490
As for memories about her, I will keep it untouched

114
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,290
and beautiful as it used to be within my heart.

115
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,090
I don't want her to see my hair like this either.

116
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,090
Dr. Agasa...

117
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,590
Shall we head home then.

118
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,890
Here, your hat.

119
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,790
No! Don't look!

120
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,190
Please!

121
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,990
Here you go, hold it nice and tight.

122
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:49,990
Okay...

123
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,690
What's up, Dr. Agasa?

124
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,790
Oh, well...

125
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:57,790
I just remembered something about her hair.

126
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,390
Hair?

127
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,290
Yeah... She had black eyes,

128
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,090
but the color of her hair was different.

129
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,590
Her hair wasn't really brown.

130
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:14,090
Blonde... One of her parents was not Japanese.

131
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,190
That's why she wore her cap deeply over her head all the time.

132
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,390
She didn't want to be teased from everyone else at school

133
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,890
because the color of her hair was different.

134
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,990
When I was in Americans,

135
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,690
I experienced being teased because of my Asian looks,

136
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,390
so I understand how she feels.

137
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,490
Which means that you're...

138
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,290
Oh, really?

139
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:36,390
Yes. My mother's British.

140
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,890
Didn't I tell you before?

141
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,190
Ayumi, will you show me that postcard?

142
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,190
Okay.

143
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,490
Did you figure something out, Conan?

144
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,590
Conan?

145
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,990
If so, this code may be...

146
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,290
"The Hint Is: Animal" -The meaning of these numbers are...

147
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,190
Hey, Dr. Agasa! Did that girl have a pet or something?

148
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,490
Oh yeah...

149
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,990
They seem to have had a dog when she was little.

150
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,990
But, she said that after she was bitten, they had no pets.

151
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,690
Wait... Conan!

152
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,590
Then, don't tell me...

153
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,590
Don't tell me...

154
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,490
I see, so that's it.

155
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,190
That's what the numbers of the code meant.

156
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,790
I got it, Dr. Agasa.

157
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,590
The memorable place that she's waiting for you.

158
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,390
It's a place we know very well too.

159
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,490
"The Hint Is: Animal"

160
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,490
It's over there!

161
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:42,951
"Nocturnal Animals Building"

162
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:45,351
What? You've figured it out?

163
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,451
The place where Dr. Agasa's first love is waiting?

164
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:51,751
Yeah. After it's solved, it's no big deal.

165
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:54,551
It's a place we all know very well too.

166
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:55,651
We know it too?

167
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:57,551
Where is it?

168
00:09:57,551 --> 00:09:59,951
You go there five times a week too, Genta.

169
00:09:59,951 --> 00:10:01,551
Five times a week?

170
00:10:01,551 --> 00:10:04,551
I see the cake shop in front of my house everyday.

171
00:10:04,551 --> 00:10:07,351
I go to the yakiniku shop on the corner once a month.

172
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:10,851
So? Hurry up and answer!

173
00:10:10,851 --> 00:10:13,751
She can only wait until the sun goes down, you know.

174
00:10:13,751 --> 00:10:15,151
Hold your horses!

175
00:10:15,151 --> 00:10:18,251
If we speed there by car it won't even take 20 minutes.

176
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:21,951
First for the code written on back of the postcard about the place.

177
00:10:21,951 --> 00:10:25,851
This 4163, 33, 6, and 0...

178
00:10:25,851 --> 00:10:28,951
is like the hint says, stands for an animal.

179
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:31,151
What? Just what're you talking about?

180
00:10:31,151 --> 00:10:33,851
The donkey and the flying squirrel were wrong!

181
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:36,251
It's not a name.

182
00:10:36,251 --> 00:10:37,951
It's the cry of the animal!

183
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,251
Cry of the animal?

184
00:10:39,251 --> 00:10:42,851
Yeah. It's the number of letters used to write how the animal cries.

185
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,651
The number of letters of their cries...

186
00:10:45,651 --> 00:10:49,951
Then, what does the number six of the code stand for?

187
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:52,751
A cat cries "mew", so it's three letters in Japanese character.

188
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:54,851
Cry of cicada is seven letters.

189
00:10:54,851 --> 00:10:57,751
That's not an animal, it's an insect.

190
00:10:57,751 --> 00:11:00,151
A crow goes caw, so it's two letters.

191
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:02,551
A horse neighs, so it's four letters.

192
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:06,151
"Squeak" is for mice.

193
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:07,851
Mice?

194
00:11:07,851 --> 00:11:09,451
Don't mices go "chu"?

195
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:12,451
See, it's written by the explanation

196
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:14,251
of the Indian Flying Fox too.

197
00:11:14,251 --> 00:11:17,051
In English, the Indian Flying Squirrel cries squeak,

198
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,851
like mice.

199
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:23,051
One of her parents is not Japanese.

200
00:11:23,051 --> 00:11:26,951
I don't know whether her parents spoke to her in English but...

201
00:11:26,951 --> 00:11:30,651
It's exactly six letters so the possibility is high.

202
00:11:30,651 --> 00:11:32,651
-I see. -I get it.

203
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,251
True.

204
00:11:34,251 --> 00:11:38,851
But mice are not the only animals whose cry is six letters.

205
00:11:38,851 --> 00:11:42,251
That's true, but the animal that has something

206
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:44,651
to do with the girl of your memory is?

207
00:11:45,851 --> 00:11:48,151
Right! A hamster!

208
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:51,151
Which means that the house of the person named Mr. Chono

209
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:55,651
that you used to go over a lot to, with her is the place!

210
00:11:55,651 --> 00:11:59,451
But the place in the code is somewhere that I go a lot too, right?

211
00:11:59,451 --> 00:12:01,551
I don't know that person's house!

212
00:12:01,551 --> 00:12:03,251
Besides, I already told you, didn't I?

213
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:08,051
That I went there 20 years ago but she didn't come.

214
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:09,551
Hold your horses!

215
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:12,451
Only the number six part of the code has been solved.

216
00:12:12,451 --> 00:12:16,951
The 4163 and 33 animal is left!

217
00:12:16,951 --> 00:12:21,151
I don't think there are animals that cry that long.

218
00:12:21,151 --> 00:12:24,651
Then, what if we separate the numbers like so

219
00:12:24,651 --> 00:12:26,651
four, one, six, three and three, three.

220
00:12:28,251 --> 00:12:31,251
Four, one, six, three and three, three...

221
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,751
A dog barks, "one-one" (bow-wow)

222
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,451
so it should come out to 11...

223
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:36,251
Three, three sounds like "min-min".

224
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:38,551
It's the cry of a cidada after all.

225
00:12:38,551 --> 00:12:40,151
Don't tell me...

226
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:41,951
It's a rooster and a dog.

227
00:12:43,551 --> 00:12:46,851
The rooster cries cock-a-doodle-doo in English,

228
00:12:46,851 --> 00:12:50,851
a dog, bow-wow, so the number of letters match perfectly!

229
00:12:50,851 --> 00:12:52,951
A cook's a doodling?

230
00:12:52,951 --> 00:12:55,451
The rooster cries "coke-kokko", don't they?

231
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:58,651
That's how the cries sound to Americans.

232
00:12:58,651 --> 00:13:01,351
Then the roosters must be at elementary school

233
00:13:01,351 --> 00:13:03,751
and the dog and the Mr. Noi's house?

234
00:13:03,751 --> 00:13:06,851
Yes. She seems to have liked taking care

235
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:08,251
of the roosters at school too,

236
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:11,451
and the Mr. Noi's house is where you first met each other!

237
00:13:11,451 --> 00:13:14,251
But, the zero hasn't been solved yet.

238
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,151
Are there animals that don't cry?

239
00:13:17,151 --> 00:13:18,551
It's not that the animal doesn't cry...

240
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:20,751
There are no animals there!

241
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:24,451
I see! It's her house!

242
00:13:24,451 --> 00:13:27,851
Her parents stopped having pets.

243
00:13:27,851 --> 00:13:31,651
So, zero is Ms. Kinoshita's house.

244
00:13:31,651 --> 00:13:34,451
But, where is she waiting?

245
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:37,751
She can't possibly wait at four places at one time.

246
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:40,251
Then try connecting the four places

247
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:42,751
in the order that they're written.

248
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:46,651
Let's see. First, it's the elementary school...

249
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:47,951
Noi...

250
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:49,251
Chono...

251
00:13:49,251 --> 00:13:50,551
Kinoshita...

252
00:13:51,651 --> 00:13:52,851
Elementary school...

253
00:13:52,851 --> 00:13:53,851
Noi...

254
00:13:53,851 --> 00:13:54,851
Chono...

255
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:56,651
Kinoshita...

256
00:13:56,651 --> 00:13:59,451
Under the ginkgo lined-street!

257
00:13:59,451 --> 00:14:03,851
Yeah. I'm sure she's waiting there.

258
00:14:03,851 --> 00:14:06,751
If her feelings of 40 years ago haven't waned...

259
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:11,351
Hey, wait a second, Conan.

260
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,451
There's nobody around.

261
00:14:14,451 --> 00:14:18,251
Strange. I'm sure it's here.

262
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:20,751
Well, it's only natural that she's not here.

263
00:14:20,751 --> 00:14:24,251
After all, it's a promise we made 40 years ago.

264
00:14:24,251 --> 00:14:25,351
Dr. Agasa...

265
00:14:25,351 --> 00:14:27,251
It's still there...

266
00:14:28,251 --> 00:14:30,751
See, that white car.

267
00:14:30,751 --> 00:14:33,651
It was parked there when we went to check on the rabbits

268
00:14:33,651 --> 00:14:35,551
this morning too.

269
00:14:35,551 --> 00:14:38,851
I'm sure she was waiting in the car all the way from morning!

270
00:14:38,851 --> 00:14:41,151
Okay, let's go check it out then!

271
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,151
Okay!

272
00:14:42,151 --> 00:14:43,151
Hey...

273
00:14:48,151 --> 00:14:49,651
Nobody's inside.

274
00:14:49,651 --> 00:14:52,651
Maybe the person went out to get a bite to eat.

275
00:14:52,651 --> 00:14:54,851
No, I don't think so.

276
00:14:54,851 --> 00:14:57,651
The coffee from the fast food store is still steaming hot.

277
00:14:57,651 --> 00:15:00,651
It looks to have been eaten just a while ago.

278
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:03,251
It's quite a lot of food.

279
00:15:03,251 --> 00:15:05,251
There are enough to feed three people.

280
00:15:05,251 --> 00:15:08,351
I hope he won't get freaked out

281
00:15:08,351 --> 00:15:09,451
even if she's super plump.

282
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:32,251
What a beauty...

283
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:34,751
That can't be her.

284
00:15:34,751 --> 00:15:36,651
She's too good for him.

285
00:15:36,651 --> 00:15:39,051
Hey, Dr. Agasa, come on.

286
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:41,451
You made her wait 40 years, didn't you?

287
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:45,451
Oh, well, I don't really know if it's her yet.

288
00:15:45,451 --> 00:15:46,651
Get on with it.

289
00:15:55,351 --> 00:15:57,251
Excuse me...

290
00:15:59,951 --> 00:16:00,951
Fusae?

291
00:16:03,751 --> 00:16:06,051
A... A man?

292
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:10,751
Billy, would you mind stepping outside for a moment?#eng

293
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:14,351
Okay, take your time.

294
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,051
Excuse me.

295
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,451
Excuse me...

296
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:30,251
They sure are cute grandchildren.

297
00:16:30,251 --> 00:16:32,751
Yes... I guess...

298
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:35,451
Excuse me, pardon me for asking...

299
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:38,151
I just happened to pass by here this morning

300
00:16:38,151 --> 00:16:40,451
and these ginkgo trees caught my attention.

301
00:16:41,451 --> 00:16:44,251
They were so vivid.

302
00:16:44,251 --> 00:16:46,351
That I came back again.

303
00:16:50,351 --> 00:16:52,151
Do you not like ginkgo trees?

304
00:16:52,151 --> 00:16:54,451
Oh, no...

305
00:16:54,451 --> 00:16:57,151
They're really beautiful.

306
00:16:57,151 --> 00:17:01,151
What? Wait a second. She's...

307
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:07,751
Hey, little girl.

308
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:11,451
Are you waiting for somebody too, little girl?

309
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:13,051
Nope.

310
00:17:13,051 --> 00:17:15,651
I forgot my umbrella so I'm taking shelter from the rain

311
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:16,851
until it stops.

312
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:18,851
Is that so?

313
00:17:18,851 --> 00:17:20,051
Okay...

314
00:17:21,551 --> 00:17:23,551
I'll give you my umbrella.

315
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:25,751
But, then you're going to get wet.

316
00:17:25,751 --> 00:17:28,851
It's okay, because I feel like getting wet today.

317
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:30,251
But...

318
00:17:30,251 --> 00:17:32,251
Let's do this then.

319
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:35,151
In place of the umbrella, when you grow up,

320
00:17:35,151 --> 00:17:40,951
will you buy just one accessory or handbag that I designed, okay?

321
00:17:40,951 --> 00:17:44,351
My design is this ginkgo leaf.

322
00:17:44,351 --> 00:17:48,251
I'm not famous yet, but I'll do my best.

323
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:50,651
-Okay. -Promise.

324
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:51,951
Okay!

325
00:17:51,951 --> 00:17:53,051
Hey, Ran!

326
00:17:54,051 --> 00:17:55,251
What're you doing?

327
00:17:55,251 --> 00:17:56,851
Shinichi!

328
00:17:56,851 --> 00:17:58,851
Thank you so much!

329
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:07,551
If this woman is the one we saw back then...

330
00:18:07,551 --> 00:18:10,651
She is no doubt Dr. Agasa's first love 40 years ago.

331
00:18:11,751 --> 00:18:13,351
Okay, goodbye then.

332
00:18:13,351 --> 00:18:14,351
Goodbye.

333
00:18:15,551 --> 00:18:18,351
My husband's seems to be getting annoyed too, so...

334
00:18:18,351 --> 00:18:19,851
I'm so sorry.

335
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:29,451
Well, Dr. Agasa, how was it?

336
00:18:29,451 --> 00:18:30,451
It was her, right?

337
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:32,351
She's your first love, right?

338
00:18:34,651 --> 00:18:36,351
Dr. Agasa?

339
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:43,351
You mean, that's all, Ms. Fusae?

340
00:18:43,351 --> 00:18:45,651
After you waited 40 years to meet the man,

341
00:18:45,651 --> 00:18:47,551
you've been looking forward to seeing.

342
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:48,551
Yes...

343
00:18:49,551 --> 00:18:53,051
I didn't tell him who I was after all.

344
00:18:53,051 --> 00:18:55,151
Well, although it's only natural,

345
00:18:55,151 --> 00:18:59,351
it seems he already has a happy family.

346
00:18:59,351 --> 00:19:00,951
Besides, if he finds out that he had made

347
00:19:00,951 --> 00:19:03,251
a stupid woman wait for 40 years,

348
00:19:03,251 --> 00:19:06,051
it'll probably break his heart.

349
00:19:07,551 --> 00:19:09,751
You're really understanding about a man.

350
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:12,951
You haven't met for 40 years, aren't you?

351
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:17,051
When my hat was blown away here...

352
00:19:18,251 --> 00:19:20,451
No! Don't look!

353
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:23,551
Because my hair is funny!

354
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:25,451
It's different from everybody's!

355
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:30,651
Really?

356
00:19:34,551 --> 00:19:37,051
I like it. See...

357
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,751
It's just like this ginkgo leaf and pretty!

358
00:19:52,051 --> 00:19:56,351
I think he forgot already though.

359
00:20:06,251 --> 00:20:07,651
I'm sorry, Billy.

360
00:20:08,651 --> 00:20:11,751
For making you my mother's new husband's friend,

361
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:15,651
keep me company every 10 years for something like this.

362
00:20:15,651 --> 00:20:19,351
Don't be. My wife would get mad at me if I refused.

363
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:22,551
After all, she's a great fan of the Fusae Brand.

364
00:20:22,551 --> 00:20:26,551
But, today is the last day you'll have to do this.

365
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:27,851
Will you start off?

366
00:20:28,851 --> 00:20:31,251
Are you really sure?

367
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:34,451
Never mind, will you, please.

368
00:20:34,451 --> 00:20:36,651
Okay, boss.

369
00:20:56,451 --> 00:20:59,651
I still love ginkgo leaves very much even now!

370
00:21:10,551 --> 00:21:13,051
Excuse me, Billy?

371
00:21:13,051 --> 00:21:14,951
What? What is it?

372
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:20,651
Maybe I'll ask you to keep me company again 10 years later?

373
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:27,851
No. I don't think it will take you

374
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:30,751
that long to see each other again.

375
00:23:08,151 --> 00:23:11,351
It sure was a code that was forced making.

376
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:12,851
It can't be helped.

377
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:14,351
The person who makes the code is free

378
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,051
to think up whatever she wishes.

379
00:23:16,051 --> 00:23:18,451
Besides, when she thought up that code,

380
00:23:18,451 --> 00:23:20,851
she was still in grade school.

381
00:23:20,851 --> 00:23:23,751
It's a cute childish code.

382
00:23:23,751 --> 00:23:25,751
You're a kid yourself too.

383
00:23:28,551 --> 00:23:32,751
Dr. Agasa's first love was really beautiful, wasn't she?

384
00:23:32,751 --> 00:23:34,351
Yes.

385
00:23:34,351 --> 00:23:37,051
A gingko leaf...

386
00:23:37,051 --> 00:23:38,751
Dr. Agasa?

387
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:39,951
You're looking sort of lewd.

388
00:23:43,551 --> 00:23:45,151
-Ms. Kinoshita, -Ms. Kinoshita,

389
00:23:45,151 --> 00:23:46,551
-I still love ginkgo leaves -I still love ginkgo leaves

390
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:48,251
-very much even now! -very much even now!

391
00:23:48,251 --> 00:23:51,551
Hey, it's not nice to tease adults!

392
00:23:51,551 --> 00:23:53,051
-Ms. Kinoshita, -Ms. Kinoshita,

393
00:23:53,051 --> 00:23:54,251
-I still love ginkgo leaves -I still love ginkgo leaves

394
00:23:54,251 --> 00:23:56,651
-very much even now! -very much even now!

395
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,660
Next Conan's Hint:

396
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,540
"Olive leaf"

397
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,020
The next episode is about a kind hearted boy.

398
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,080
Which means...

399
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,200
I haven't said anything yet!
