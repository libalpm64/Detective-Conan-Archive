1
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,230
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,230
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,930
A strange murder takes place at a pottery making class.

4
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,930
The words on a tea cup also poses a mystery.

5
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,530
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,330
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,430
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,690
Ran decides to go to the pottery making class Sonoko is going to.

9
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:04,490
You're pretty good for a beginner.

10
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,190
Mr. Mino.

11
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,290
Attention, everyone!

12
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,390
Does anyone know this child?

13
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,990
Conan?

14
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,990
And I go to check up on her.

15
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,690
The instructor of the pottery making class is Muneyuki Mino

16
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,390
and his assistant is Kikuyo Kasama.

17
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,790
Later, Mr. Mino's adopted son-in-law,

18
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,690
Motoo Mino comes back from work.

19
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,890
But he suddenly disappears.

20
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,590
This storage room's the only place we haven't looked.

21
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,590
The cabinet...

22
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,390
A piece of cloth...

23
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,290
is sticking out from under the cabinet door.

24
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,990
Isn't it one of the aprons you use in class?

25
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,690
-Motoo... -Snap out of it!

26
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,090
Wake up, Motoo!

27
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,790
Motoo...

28
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,390
I know who the killer is, but...

29
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,990
I'm finished!

30
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,990
It's my tea cup! Pretty good, huh?

31
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,690
Yes, that's really quite good.

32
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,090
But you know, sonny,

33
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,490
it appears as if you're worried about something.

34
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,390
You're either hiding some deep, dark secret

35
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,090
or debating about something important.

36
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,690
I'm right, aren't I?

37
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,490
The soul never lies.

38
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,690
You're very good, sir.

39
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,990
I think you should take care of your own affairs

40
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,090
before meddling in other people's.

41
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,490
But this is the cup you made, sir.

42
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,590
What?

43
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,390
While you were busy looking through the desk,

44
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,990
I put yours over here.

45
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,190
I thought for sure you'd catch on.

46
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,490
And if this is your tea cup,

47
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,490
then you must be hiding something.

48
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,990
Mr. Mino, what are you hiding?

49
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,290
Tell me.

50
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:28,690
"Murder At The Pottery Making Class (Part 2)"

51
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,790
This kid...

52
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,790
Excuse me.

53
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,290
Did you find a pen?

54
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,790
Yes, here.

55
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,290
Use this.

56
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,490
Thank you, and may I also use this desk?

57
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,890
By all means.

58
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,890
I appreciate this.

59
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,890
Now, please go back to the storage room

60
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,390
where the inspector is waiting.

61
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,790
All right.

62
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,490
No doubt about it.

63
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,390
Mr. Mino is the murderer.

64
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,490
I've pretty much figured out his alibi trick

65
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,990
but while I was checking the body, he hid the evidence.

66
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,390
I saw him pick up those scissors,

67
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,490
that means the evidence is still somewhere.

68
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,490
It's got to be someplace.

69
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,590
But if I can't find it...

70
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,390
Gosh. Isn't there something else?

71
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,990
Something that the killer's missed.

72
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,390
Think...

73
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,490
Sorry, kid.

74
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,890
A necktie.

75
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,190
Yes, this is it!

76
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,190
I've found it!

77
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,790
I've finally found it.

78
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,990
You overlooked a piece of evidence,

79
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,690
only a professional potter would leave behind.

80
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,040
Inspector Megure!

81
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,540
I've confirmed the details.

82
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,640
Give it to me.

83
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,840
And that's not the only thing I learned.

84
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,840
I see, debts.

85
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,940
Kasama Kikuyo.

86
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,040
It seems you have debts totalling 10,000,000 yen.

87
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,040
Yes, I do. I found a nice condominium.

88
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,640
What about it?

89
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,240
Nothing. I just thought it was interesting.

90
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,640
The late Mr. Motoo just took out an insurance policy last week

91
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,840
and the premium was for exactly 10,000,000 yen, payable to you.

92
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,140
The timing just seemed so perfect.

93
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,440
On top of that,

94
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,040
just before Mr. Motoo's body was discovered in the cabinet,

95
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,740
you had come to get the first aid kit from that very cabinet.

96
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,140
If you weren't the murderer,

97
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,140
you surely would have seen his body in there.

98
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,440
I already told you!

99
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,940
I opened the cabinet but nobody was inside!

100
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,840
Besides, it didn't take me more than a minute

101
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,740
to go get the first aid kit and return.

102
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,240
There's no way I could kill someone

103
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,140
and hide the body in the cabinet!

104
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,940
According to everyone's testimony, when Mr. Mino got hurt,

105
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,640
you volunteered to get the first aid kit.

106
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,240
What if you had already put Motoo's body in the cabinet?

107
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,140
You didn't want his body to be discovered yet

108
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,240
so you went to get the first aid kit yourself.

109
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,740
But when you opened the cabinet,

110
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,140
his apron slid out and got caught in the door.

111
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,040
Maybe that's what happened.

112
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,140
That's absurd! I'm not a murderer!

113
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,340
Don't lie, Kikuyo.

114
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,740
I saw you.

115
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,140
I came in here looking for you.

116
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,740
I saw you choking Motoo's neck.

117
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,840
Is that true?

118
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,840
It is. She said she was helping Motoo change

119
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,940
but that's not what it looked like.

120
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,940
I was just playing...

121
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,940
You can tell us about it down at the station.

122
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,340
Hold on a minute, officer!

123
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,840
What's wrong, Inspector?

124
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,540
You know, every time we start to walk out with the suspect,

125
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,940
a strange voice stops us.

126
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,040
It goes, "Funyaa" or "Oops", like that.

127
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,440
Oh, you're talking about Kogoro Mouri.

128
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,440
Well, you can rest assured. He's not here today.

129
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,540
Oh, that's right.

130
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,540
Funyaa...

131
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,840
Sonoko, what's the matter?

132
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,140
I just remembered! This girl does it, too.

133
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:46,540
Inspector Megure, you've done it again. I'm so bored.

134
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,140
How dare you!

135
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,940
Didn't you notice it?

136
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,240
The victim Motoo's sleeves were rolled up

137
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,040
but the lengths weren't the same.

138
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,140
Doesn't that seem like

139
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,940
he was attacked while he was working in the class?

140
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,940
And if that's the case,

141
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,140
then the killer could only be that person, don't you think?

142
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,640
Who are you talking about?

143
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,940
You don't mean...

144
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,240
Yes. That person who came into this storage room

145
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,840
while Kikuyo was helping Motoo change

146
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,140
then forced her to return to the class,

147
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,340
leaving him alone with the victim... that person is...

148
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,840
Muneyuki Mino!

149
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,840
Yes, you are the murderer!

150
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,540
Sonoko.

151
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,240
We noticed the thing about his sleeves

152
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,340
but Mr. Mino has an alibi.

153
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,140
According to Ran's testimony,

154
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,140
when Mr. Mino left the storage room earlier today,

155
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,440
the apron wasn't sticking out like it was

156
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,240
when they discovered the body.

157
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,440
And he was with all of you the entire time later that day, wasn't he?

158
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,140
Besides, just before the body was discovered,

159
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,940
Kikuyo had come and opened the cabinet.

160
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,840
We're not sure she's actually the killer yet

161
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,740
but she should have screamed if he was inside,

162
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,040
wouldn't that be the natural thing to do?

163
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,740
That is, if she didn't kill him.

164
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,340
And unless Mr. Mino was a magician,

165
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,840
there isn't any way he could have put the body in the cabinet

166
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,740
without using his hands. Isn't that right?

167
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,540
No. Actually, he did use magic.

168
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,440
Mr. Mino used Ran and Kikuyo as assistants

169
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,240
and made Motoo's body appear in the cabinet

170
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,540
after making it seem like he wasn't inside.

171
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,840
Kikuyo and I were assistants?

172
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,540
The proof of the pudding is in the eating.

173
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,740
You'll know what I mean when we reenact it.

174
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,040
Let's see.

175
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,840
Officer Takagi. Will you be my assistant?

176
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,940
What? Who, me?

177
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,190
Take a good look, people. What you see before

178
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,690
is a simple cabinet with nothing rigged.

179
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:57,590
Please check and make sure nothing is sticking out of the cabinet.

180
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,690
Everything's clear.

181
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,290
All right then, please open the door on the right side.

182
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,190
It's opened.

183
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,290
You've checked and made sure nothing is inside?

184
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,490
Yes.

185
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,390
I didn't notice anything unusual.

186
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,790
A piece of cloth is sticking out from under the cabinet?

187
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,190
That's strange.

188
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,990
That cloth wasn't here before.

189
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,990
So that's how it was done! It's on the inside of the door!

190
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,190
That's right.

191
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,690
I asked Conan and the man from the crime lab

192
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,990
to stick that handkerchief there.

193
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,690
I'm almost certain Mr. Mino taped the end of the apron

194
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,990
to the inside of the accordion style door's right side

195
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,690
then closed the door while pushing the end of the apron inside.

196
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,590
Then, when someone opens the door,

197
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:54,590
the apron will be pulled out.

198
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,590
And when the door is closed again, the apron would stick out.

199
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,990
What I'm saying is, Mr. Mino...

200
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,690
deliberately cracked the plate in front of the cabinet

201
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,290
so that Ran would see that

202
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,490
there was nothing sticking out from underneath

203
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,290
when she was cleaning up.

204
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,190
Then he made Kikuyo go get the first aid kit

205
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,690
telling her he had hurt his hand.

206
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,190
When she opened the door to the cabinet,

207
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,490
the apron came loose and got caught under the door.

208
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,890
I see.

209
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:27,090
That way it would look like there was nobody in the cabinet

210
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,990
when Ran was cleaning up the broken plate

211
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:33,290
and as if someone had put it in there later.

212
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,090
But...

213
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:40,090
what if Kikuyo had noticed the apron when closing the door

214
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,690
after getting the first aid kit?

215
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,190
I don't think she would look down when closing the door,

216
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:48,090
not knowing that there was an injured person waiting for her.

217
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,990
So where was the body all that time?

218
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,490
When the door was opened, the body fell out

219
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:58,990
that means the body was probably leaning against the door.

220
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,990
Kikuyo had to have seen it when she got the first aid kit.

221
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,090
I think we'll know the answer

222
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,590
when we open the door one more time.

223
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,990
Huh?

224
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:12,490
But this time, open both doors at the same time.

225
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,890
Both sides at the same time?

226
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,990
A mop?

227
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,090
This wasn't in there the last time I opened it up.

228
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,190
How'd you do that?

229
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,690
It's a simple trick.

230
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,290
I tied some string to the top of the mop,

231
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:37,690
then made a knot at the end of the string.

232
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,590
Next, I passed the string

233
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,490
through the hanger bar on the right side shelf

234
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,490
and hung the mop so it leaned forward.

235
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,990
Then I passed the string

236
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,690
through the opening above the door on the left side,

237
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,290
pulled it so that the knot would get caught

238
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,390
when the door closed and that kept it in place.

239
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,190
That way, even when the door on the right is opened,

240
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,190
the mop is hidden by the joint.

241
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,790
When both doors are opened at the same time,

242
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:07,490
the knot which is the stopper comes loose

243
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,290
and the mop falls out!

244
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,390
The mop is Motoo,

245
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,790
the string is his necktie,

246
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,090
and the knot in the string.

247
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,390
You've got to be kidding.

248
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,090
His tie pin?

249
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,790
That's right.

250
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:26,290
When you look at the tie around Motoo's neck,

251
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,390
you'll see for yourself, it so obvious.

252
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,790
The reason his tie pin was so attached so low was

253
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:35,390
it was adjusted to accommodate this trick,

254
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,290
the hole the tie pin made was big proving

255
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,790
Motoo's weight stretched it out.

256
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,790
But wouldn't someone notice if the end of the neckties

257
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:51,890
were sticking out from above the left door?

258
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,390
Not if you were to roll it up

259
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,890
and stuff it into the space in the door.

260
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:01,390
Then when did he retrieve the piece of apron?

261
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,790
When the police arrived,

262
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,890
we didn't find anything like that in the cabinet.

263
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,790
Besides, he discovered Motoo's body

264
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,790
when all you students were present, didn't he?

265
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:15,390
He couldn't have retrieved it with all of you watching.

266
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,690
He certainly could.

267
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,390
When Motoo fell out of the cabinet,

268
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,790
Mr. Mino moved to the right side, bent down

269
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,990
and while he pretended to be trying to rouse him,

270
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,490
he opened the right door fully

271
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,490
and used his body to hide the apron

272
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,290
sticking out from under the door.

273
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,790
Then if he tore it tape and all,

274
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,190
no one would notice it, would they?

275
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:40,190
See, when the door is partially open...

276
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:44,390
The apron is hidden by the V shape joint on the inside

277
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,190
and when the door is opened fully,

278
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,590
it sticks out from the left side, doesn't it?

279
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:55,090
Mr. Mino tore that and hid it in his pocket.

280
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,390
Yes, I see what you mean.

281
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,490
Then we'd find that piece of cloth

282
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,490
if we search his pockets.

283
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,090
This is absurd.

284
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:07,790
Take a look. As you can see, I don't have such a thing.

285
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,990
What is this, Sonoko?

286
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,990
He probably hid it in the toilet or someplace

287
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:18,690
before the police arrived while I was checking the body.

288
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,090
In the toilet?

289
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,590
Conan saw Mr. Mino looking for scissors

290
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,490
so he probably meant to cut it into little pieces

291
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:28,290
and flush it down the toilet.

292
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:31,290
-Takagi, check it out. -Yes, sir!

293
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:38,090
It doesn't matter what and where you find it. I'm not guilty.

294
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:42,490
No one actually saw me hiding anything.

295
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,890
Besides, anyone could have rigged

296
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:49,490
the trick that girl just explained.

297
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:50,690
You're right.

298
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,890
Even if we do find the piece of apron,

299
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,490
the moment it left your person,

300
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,390
it lost its weight as evidence against you.

301
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,590
But unfortunately, Mr. Mino,

302
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:07,390
there's solid evidence remaining that incriminates you.

303
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,390
What?

304
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,390
It's on the back of the tie that was tied around Motoo's neck.

305
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,590
This is...

306
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,990
Scratch marks?

307
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,490
That's right.

308
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,590
It's from the soil that's embedded in Mr. Mino's fingertips.

309
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:28,190
It's not unthinkable for those scratch marks to be there.

310
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:33,090
Mr. Mino was making a tea cup with Conan

311
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:36,090
and judging from the position of the tie pin,

312
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,490
the necktie was just barely long enough

313
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,990
to keep the body suspended.

314
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,390
The only way he could avoid getting his fingerprints

315
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,490
on the tie pin while pulling the body up

316
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,490
and getting the tie pin over the door, was to grip the necktie tightly.

317
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,890
Mr. Mino, you made two mistakes.

318
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:57,590
First, you didn't use gloves.

319
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,090
Second,

320
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:03,590
you chose to use that necktie to pull the body up.

321
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,090
If you had used gloves,

322
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,890
you could have looped the tie pin with your fingers

323
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:10,290
and pulled the body up.

324
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:14,990
And if you had used string with a knot instead of the necktie...

325
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,190
you wouldn't have made those scratch marks.

326
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,390
Putting gloves on

327
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:27,990
makes it seem as if I were touching something dirty.

328
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,090
My late daughter gave that tie to him,

329
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:33,490
it was a symbol of her love for him.

330
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:36,190
It was for Christmas.

331
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,690
Then, the birthday card

332
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,390
and that tie he found in his bag yesterday...

333
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,890
It was from me.

334
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:49,090
I knew he'd assume it was from you.

335
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,990
I was determined to use it

336
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,090
to show him the grief my daughter felt.

337
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,590
And I wanted you to take all the blame.

338
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,790
I started to suspect the relationship between you two

339
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,790
when my daughter was struck by the truck and died, 2 years ago.

340
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,590
It was 3 days after Christmas.

341
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,790
The funeral was over and I was cleaning her room,

342
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,190
that's when I found it.

343
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,490
The necktie was crumpled

344
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,890
and thrown in the trash bin, box and all.

345
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,390
I thought he did it by mistake

346
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,690
so I rushed to the airport to give it to him.

347
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,190
I expected to see a man

348
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,290
grieving over the recent loss of his beloved wife

349
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:35,190
waiting sadly for his flight to take him to his work assignment.

350
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,490
But the man I saw at the airport wasn't a man

351
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,790
who had recently lost e woman he loved.

352
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,990
What I saw was a fraud. He was holding you

353
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,590
and you two were laughing and enjoying yourselves.

354
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,590
That's when I knew,

355
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,690
my daughter wasn't hit by the car.

356
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,390
She found out about you two

357
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,890
so she threw herself in front of the car, killing herself.

358
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:10,290
But how did you know this necktie was for Motoo?

359
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:14,590
Maybe she was going to give it to you.

360
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,390
I knew.

361
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,490
After all, she...

362
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,190
She told me.

363
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:25,390
Beige?

364
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,890
Isn't that color rather plain for Motoo?

365
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,390
It doesn't matter. I like beige and besides,

366
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:33,290
I want him to be a little more like you.

367
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,390
Beige is the color of the soil.

368
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,840
That's your color, isn't it, dad?

369
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,390
I guess

370
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:47,190
you could say it was a father's intuition.

371
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,790
"Three days later"

372
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,490
You got a letter from Kyogoku?

373
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,390
Then why are you so sad, Sonoko?

374
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,090
Take a look at this picture!

375
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:38,390
He thought you made him a vase.

376
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,890
I guess you could say I "vasted" my time.

377
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,790
Imbecile.

378
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:48,690
So? Ran, did you send yours to "you know who"?

379
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:49,690
What?

380
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,990
Didnt you have your friend the living national treasure

381
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,190
fire yours up for you?

382
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,190
Well, no. I don't think I did it right.

383
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,490
That's why I didn't send it.

384
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,790
I think they are all gone.

385
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,890
-Hey, Conan. -Huh?

386
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,990
I hate to ask, but could you go get the bag of chips on my desk?

387
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,790
Okie dokie.

388
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,590
What's this? It's a chopstick holder.

389
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,190
It looks familiar.

390
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,290
Mystery maniac is a complete fool?

391
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:25,890
I get it now. So this is the tea cup Ran made.

392
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:29,690
I understand why she couldn't send a silly tea cup like this.

393
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,290
I'll be waiting for you.

394
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,990
Conan, what are you doing?

395
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,690
Hurry up, we're waiting.

396
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,390
Yeah, coming!

397
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,590
Conan looks so happy.

398
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,390
Kind of creepy, isn't it?

399
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,380
Next Conan's Hint:

400
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,200
"Message"
