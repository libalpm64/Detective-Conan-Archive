1
00:00:03,968 --> 00:00:05,668
Summer shines but only yesterday.

2
00:00:05,668 --> 00:00:07,268
After you cry, there is a cheesecake waiting for you.

3
00:00:07,268 --> 00:00:08,768
A keyword to find the criminal,

4
00:00:08,768 --> 00:00:11,268
is it Japanese, English or German?

5
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:12,768
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,768 --> 00:00:14,168
A child in appearance with the IQ of an adult.

7
00:00:14,168 --> 00:00:16,468
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:57,449 --> 00:01:59,349
We were at a soccer stadium,

9
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:01,249
watching a Tokyo Spirits game.

10
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:17,149
But the Tokyo Spirits lost.

11
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:20,849
We were so depressed so we headed to a department store.

12
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:26,849
There, we met a guy named Rutger from Germany.

13
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:29,849
"Rutger Heinen (42)" -But he happened to be attacked by somebody!

14
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,849
While half unconscious,

15
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:35,149
he pointed at a person as the criminal.

16
00:02:35,149 --> 00:02:36,349
It was Genta.

17
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:39,749
What? Is it me?

18
00:02:39,749 --> 00:02:41,349
But, don't worry!

19
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:45,149
Mr. Rutger left us a hint.

20
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:46,549
A hint?

21
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:48,649
Before he fainted,

22
00:02:48,649 --> 00:02:50,349
Mr. Rutger pointed his finger at Genta.

23
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:53,049
Saying criminal.

24
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:54,749
He said that to you?

25
00:02:54,749 --> 00:03:00,349
Yes. Was it me?

26
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:04,349
And he grabbed my shoulder and said El.

27
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:09,949
E...

28
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:14,149
El...

29
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:15,449
So, the criminal

30
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:18,449
is someone that has something in common with Genta,

31
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:22,749
and someone who has something to do with the word El.

32
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:31,349
"Genta's Knockout Shoot (Part 2)"

33
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:32,349
"Parking Entrance"

34
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:33,349
What?

35
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:35,749
Why am I here?

36
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,149
What the heck is this?

37
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:41,449
Why do I have to tell you people about it?

38
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:43,449
What is going on?

39
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:45,749
Here he is, Inspector.

40
00:03:45,749 --> 00:03:48,549
Hey, I really don't have time.

41
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:49,649
"Hiromasa Inagaki (35)" -I'm sorry,

42
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:52,449
"Hiromasa Inagaki (35)" -but an assault case has happened,

43
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:54,349
and you guys were the only ones

44
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:56,749
"Tatsuzo Genda (44)" -who were here at the moment of the crime.

45
00:03:56,749 --> 00:03:58,849
So we need your cooperation.

46
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:01,149
"Kanji Kojima (28)" -What the heck! Are you kidding me?

47
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:02,749
You are saying that we are the suspects?

48
00:04:02,749 --> 00:04:05,049
Well, you could refuse to cooperate with us here,

49
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:09,149
but it's gonna end up with us visiting your house sometime later.

50
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:11,749
Darn.

51
00:04:11,749 --> 00:04:14,849
Alright! I'll tell you what I was doing!

52
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:18,349
I was just listening to the radio relay of a horse race!

53
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:23,049
This department store is close to an outside betting booth,

54
00:04:23,049 --> 00:04:24,249
and also I was hoping to do some shopping

55
00:04:24,249 --> 00:04:27,749
if I won a long shot on the track.

56
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:31,349
I see. Your name, sir?

57
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:33,249
Kanji Kojima.

58
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:35,249
Ko... Kojima?

59
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:38,549
You are the criminal, aren't you?

60
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:39,549
What?

61
00:04:39,549 --> 00:04:42,249
You have the same last name as Genta!

62
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:43,249
Genta?

63
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,049
The number on your back is solid evidence too!

64
00:04:46,049 --> 00:04:50,349
11 is the number Hide in Tokyo Spirits wears!

65
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:54,549
Genta is wearing a polo shirt of that team!

66
00:04:55,349 --> 00:04:56,349
Are you stupid?

67
00:04:56,349 --> 00:05:00,649
There's a scoring leader named Naoki in Tokyo Spirits.

68
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:02,649
Yeah, that's right but...

69
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:05,049
In fact, we called him Genta

70
00:05:05,049 --> 00:05:09,149
but never called him Kojima before Mr. Rutger, right?

71
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:13,149
Right. Without knowing Mr Kojima's name,

72
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:16,449
it seems impossible for Mr. Rutger to call him Genta, right?

73
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,849
That seems right.

74
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:20,149
Okay, next.

75
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:22,449
Why were you here?

76
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:25,549
I was here to buy this bag that my girl asked me for,

77
00:05:25,549 --> 00:05:27,249
but there was none here.

78
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:30,149
So I decided to go to another department store

79
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:33,049
but the gate at the parking exit was broken.

80
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:34,649
Man, what a bad day.

81
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:36,949
Your name, sir?

82
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:38,349
What? Yes.

83
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:41,849
-My name is Genda... -Genta?

84
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:43,149
You must be the one!

85
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:46,549
It's Genda! Tatsuzo Genda!

86
00:05:46,549 --> 00:05:48,549
I don't know what's going on, but I am not Genta!

87
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:51,849
No, Mr. Rutger must have heard it wrong!

88
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:55,749
You are fat just like Genta too!

89
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:56,949
Oh, please.

90
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:00,449
How many fat people do you think are out there in this world?

91
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:03,849
You know, Doc and Inspector Megure are fat too.

92
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:04,849
Right.

93
00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:09,349
Mr. Rutger would not leave such a vague hint

94
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:13,249
if he didn't know that these three people were the suspects.

95
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:18,149
Also, after Mr Rutger saying criminal to Genta,

96
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:20,849
he mentioned El.

97
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:23,949
If he knew Genta's name, he would've said his name, right?

98
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:25,949
Right...

99
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:27,549
Okay, last. You.

100
00:06:27,549 --> 00:06:29,449
Why were you here?

101
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:32,849
My name is Hiromasa Itagaki and I came here to see a new idol,

102
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:38,849
Ai Sakaguchi's photo session on the 6th floor of this building.

103
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:40,749
I'm just her groupy.

104
00:06:40,749 --> 00:06:43,249
Wait a second!

105
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:44,549
According to your driving license,

106
00:06:44,549 --> 00:06:47,649
your name "Hiromasa" is written "Taisho" in kanji, right?

107
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:49,449
Yeah. That's right, but...

108
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:54,749
"Inagaki Hiromasa" -If I take the first character of your name...

109
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:57,349
Gakidaisho!

110
00:06:57,349 --> 00:06:59,849
It means pesky kid! It's Genta!

111
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:01,349
Didn't you hear me?

112
00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:04,349
Mr. Rutger didn't know the criminal's name.

113
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:07,549
But it matches too well to Genta.

114
00:07:07,549 --> 00:07:09,649
And look at his hat too!

115
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:13,749
-What? -You see the big letter L on it?

116
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:16,049
This is...

117
00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:20,149
This is one of Ai Sakaguchi's original goods.

118
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:22,149
It has nothing to do with that El, I think.

119
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:23,149
What?

120
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:25,549
If Mr. Rutger wanted to mention hat,

121
00:07:25,549 --> 00:07:28,749
he would've said "Love" rather than "El".

122
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:29,949
But...

123
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,649
Maybe he couldn't read it because he is German.

124
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:33,949
Did you forget?

125
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:36,049
His ex-wife is English.

126
00:07:36,049 --> 00:07:38,949
And because of her, he can speak English.

127
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:40,249
There's no way that

128
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:42,749
he would read the word "love" "L" "O" "V" "E"

129
00:07:42,749 --> 00:07:46,349
It's not like Japanese words, such as "hot" and "tough",

130
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:48,049
And also "bill" and "talisman" which you write in the same

131
00:07:48,049 --> 00:07:49,449
but pronounce differently.

132
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:54,149
I see. I get it.

133
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:55,649
What?

134
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:59,049
Actually there are some words in German and English

135
00:07:59,049 --> 00:08:02,149
that have same spelling with different meanings as well.

136
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:06,649
Are you talking about the message Mr. Rutger left?

137
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:07,849
Yes.

138
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:09,349
What he was trying to tell us in the message

139
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:12,749
was that the criminal was like Genta or in other word a pesky kid.

140
00:08:12,749 --> 00:08:15,249
Hey, Inspector.

141
00:08:15,249 --> 00:08:17,249
You gotta let us go now.

142
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:20,249
You can't keep us here anymore

143
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,149
just because we happened to be here at the moment of the crime.

144
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:26,549
I have to go too, otherwise the photo session is gonna be over...

145
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:30,249
But you need to give us more details about what happened here.

146
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:32,349
Shut up! I did not notice

147
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:36,149
any assault case or whatever you guys are talking about, okay?

148
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:39,549
I was listening to the horse race on the radio at top volume.

149
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,549
I just couldn't leave this parking lot

150
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,749
because the gate was broken.

151
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:47,749
Otherwise, I would be at home already with the bag I had to buy.

152
00:08:47,749 --> 00:08:52,749
I was in a hurry because I wanted to get to the photo session early.

153
00:08:52,749 --> 00:08:54,549
So I can get a nice shooting location.

154
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:55,949
I see.

155
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:59,549
So, you all were here at the moment of the crime

156
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:01,749
but did not notice anything,

157
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:05,149
or did not even see a suspicious person, am I correct?

158
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:07,149
Yeah, that's right!

159
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:10,749
You are getting suspicious toward the wrong people.

160
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:13,649
I don't know what's going on

161
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:14,749
but the guy who was attacked

162
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:17,449
pointed at this fat kid and said,

163
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:19,849
"Criminal", right?

164
00:09:19,849 --> 00:09:23,549
Then, he is the one who did it, isn't he?

165
00:09:23,549 --> 00:09:24,749
That's right.

166
00:09:24,749 --> 00:09:27,749
He was all alone kicking the soccer ball.

167
00:09:27,749 --> 00:09:33,149
Maybe he missed kicking the ball and the ball hit someone...

168
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:34,449
He didn't!

169
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,549
Genta did not do it!

170
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:39,249
Ayumi...

171
00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:40,949
What do you think about it, man?

172
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:43,649
What... I think...

173
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:47,049
Mr. Rutger didn't mean that Genta was the one who did it.

174
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:49,749
Mr. Rutger pointed at Genta because he wanted to say

175
00:09:49,749 --> 00:09:52,349
that Genta had similar features with the man

176
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:56,849
who attacked him with the steel pipe.

177
00:09:56,849 --> 00:09:59,949
In other words, he's just like Genta.

178
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:02,749
He's like a pesky kid.

179
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:04,249
What?

180
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:06,649
A pesky kid?

181
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:09,849
I don't get it... really...

182
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:11,849
Hey, Mr. Agasa.

183
00:10:11,849 --> 00:10:15,149
This is a case of assault, not mischief.

184
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:18,549
No, what I'm talking about is the image.

185
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:21,149
-Oh! I get it! -What?

186
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:22,849
The person who attacked Mr. Rutger

187
00:10:22,849 --> 00:10:25,949
is Mr. Hiromasa Inagaki! It was you!

188
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:26,949
What?

189
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:28,549
You came here for an idol's photo session,

190
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:30,149
so you must have a camera!

191
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:31,749
So, you are a camera kid.

192
00:10:31,749 --> 00:10:33,949
Which could be interpreted that you are a pesky kid!

193
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:35,149
No way.

194
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:38,549
Camera kid and pesky kid are different, right?

195
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:39,949
But they are kinda similar, aren't they?

196
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:41,149
Hey, you know what?

197
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:43,549
I think Mr. Kojima is the criminal!

198
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:44,949
What?

199
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:48,649
Because he looks like he'd done a lot of mischief!

200
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,549
What?

201
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:54,649
What are you, kidding me?

202
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:57,149
You can't just make me a criminal because of that!

203
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:00,249
He does look like he was, as Ayumi said

204
00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:05,749
but I don't think Mr. Rutger knew about Mr. Kojima's childhood.

205
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,849
Then, we got...

206
00:11:07,849 --> 00:11:10,149
That man named Genda,

207
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:13,549
but he's more a cool and wild middle-aged man

208
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:15,649
rather than a pesky kid.

209
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:18,149
He just looks evil to me.

210
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:21,749
Wait a second. What I'm saying is not that.

211
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:24,849
-What? -I don't see what is going on.

212
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:27,049
I'm saying that it was an English word, not a Japanese word...

213
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:28,749
It was elf.

214
00:11:28,749 --> 00:11:29,949
Elf?

215
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:34,649
It's the pixies that you hear in fantasy stories.

216
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:36,349
Pixies?

217
00:11:36,349 --> 00:11:39,549
Haibara...

218
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:46,759
Elf.

219
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:49,959
It means small pixie in English.

220
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,559
But at the same time,

221
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:55,859
it also means little kid or pesky kid.

222
00:11:55,859 --> 00:11:56,959
I got it!

223
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,359
Mr. Rutger said El after he pointed at Genta!

224
00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:03,959
But he actually wanted to say elf!

225
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,859
But why does it have to be Genta?

226
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:10,659
Sure, Genta looks more like a pesky kid among you all

227
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:12,459
but it could be Ayumi

228
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:14,559
if the word elf means small pixie or a little kid, right?

229
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:19,059
The soccer ball Genta kicked hit Mr. Rutger's car.

230
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:20,159
Really?

231
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:24,959
And then he looked at Genta and said,

232
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,459
"A pesky kid", precisely.

233
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:30,159
I think Mr. Rutger wanted to say that the criminal

234
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:33,059
was someone like Genta or elf.

235
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:35,559
The criminal is an elf?

236
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,859
I see.

237
00:12:36,859 --> 00:12:41,859
The word elf is the hint to find out who the criminal is.

238
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:46,859
And the victim told us that by pointing his finger at Genta.

239
00:12:46,859 --> 00:12:49,459
It still doesn't make sense though.

240
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:53,759
One of these three men is the pesky kid or a small pixie

241
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,659
but they don't seem to be.

242
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:58,359
What do you think, Mr. Agasa?

243
00:12:58,359 --> 00:13:00,159
I forgot to tell you.

244
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:03,459
Mr. Rutger is German, so he can speak German, of course.

245
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:06,859
But in addition, he can also speaks English and Japanese as well!

246
00:13:06,859 --> 00:13:08,159
Is that true?

247
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,359
Do you know how to count numbers in Mr. Rutger's mother tongue,

248
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,559
or German?

249
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,059
Number?

250
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:16,159
You know, Takagi?

251
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,759
I think...

252
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:20,359
Un, deux, trios...

253
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:22,959
That's French.

254
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,159
In German, 1 is eins.

255
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:28,159
2 is zwei,

256
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,759
3 is drei,

257
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,459
4 is vier,

258
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:33,059
5 is funf,

259
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:34,759
6 is sechs,

260
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:36,559
7 is sieben,

261
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:38,459
8 is acht,

262
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:40,359
9 is neun,

263
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:42,359
10 is zehn,

264
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:44,759
and 11

265
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,059
is elf...

266
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,459
What?

267
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:50,759
-Mr. Kanji Kojima. -What?

268
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:56,159
It's the number on your back!

269
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,059
I see.

270
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:04,759
Mr. Rutger meant both 11 in German and elf in English

271
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:07,859
when he pointed at Kojima.

272
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:09,959
Yes. He thought Conan knew a lot about German and England,

273
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,359
and thus trusted him.

274
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:14,759
Yeah, and you, Doc.

275
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:18,459
He thought we would figure out the meaning of elf!

276
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:21,059
Well, he can speak Japanese.

277
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:24,059
He could've said 11 in Japanese. It would be so much easier.

278
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:28,459
Maybe he thought that the criminal was walking around,

279
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:31,059
and therefore made it more complicated on purpose.

280
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:34,459
So that we won't be attacked by the criminal.

281
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,159
I see.

282
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:41,459
Now Mr. Kojima, you need to come to the station, please?

283
00:14:42,859 --> 00:14:46,459
Are you kidding me, Inspector?

284
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:48,759
You all are talking about elf or whatever,

285
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:51,159
and I had 11 on my back,

286
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:53,359
but you can't make me a criminal just because of that.

287
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:57,159
Did that German guy say elf clearly?

288
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:59,559
I'm asking, old man!

289
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:02,959
If you keep trusting that old man's random deduction,

290
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,559
you'll look like a fool.

291
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:07,459
It seems like a pretty reasonable deduction though.

292
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:09,159
-It's nothing. -Hey, old man!

293
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,959
You've been standing on you soapbox for long.

294
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,259
No. I...

295
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:13,859
I am Japanese!

296
00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:15,859
I don't care about elf or whatever it is!

297
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:17,359
Stop it, please!

298
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:20,659
If you say so,

299
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:22,159
why don't you show me evidence?

300
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:24,559
-What? -You are saying I'm the criminal, right?

301
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:26,959
Then show me solid evidence.

302
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:29,959
Is there any?

303
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:36,159
Is there anybody who saw me hitting the foreigner and running away?

304
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:39,859
You treat me like a criminal without solid evidence.

305
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:44,459
I don't think I can stand this, Inspector.

306
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:46,559
I can't cooperate with you people anymore!

307
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:47,959
I'm gonna go home.

308
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:49,859
Wait, Mr. Kojima.

309
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:50,959
I saw it.

310
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:57,559
I saw Mr. Kojima

311
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,959
hit Mr. Rutger and run away.

312
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,559
I actually saw it.

313
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,859
What?

314
00:16:02,859 --> 00:16:05,359
Is that true, Conan?

315
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:08,859
Yeah! When we found Mr. Rutger on the ground,

316
00:16:08,859 --> 00:16:12,659
I also saw this person running away in a hurry!

317
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:13,959
Hey, kid!

318
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:16,059
Right, guys? You guys saw it too!

319
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,759
You saw him, right?

320
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,059
Conan?

321
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:24,159
You rascal!

322
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,959
Say that again, I'm gonna...

323
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:28,559
Can you really prove it?

324
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,659
Yeah!

325
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:31,659
Hey, why do you trust him?

326
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:34,059
I don't understand. Don't you see it's strange?

327
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:37,159
How come he didn't say it from the beginning if he really saw me?

328
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:40,159
That old man is the reason!

329
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,659
He's saying complete nonsense and this kid is going along with that!

330
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:45,159
They're all lying!

331
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:46,659
Anyway,

332
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:49,359
we need you to come to the station with Conan, please.

333
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:50,359
We'll talk there...

334
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:51,959
No. I won't go there!

335
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,159
I don't have time to deal with a kid's lie!

336
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:56,559
It's not a lie!

337
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:59,959
I remember the number on your back clearly!

338
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:02,159
You little prick! I'm gonna make you shut up!

339
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,659
-Stop! -It's true!

340
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:04,759
I saw it...

341
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:08,659
Because I was the one who found Mr. Rutger first!

342
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:10,259
What?

343
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:11,659
Conan?

344
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:19,059
Did you hear that? Did you hear that, man?

345
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:21,359
This kid just gave himself away!

346
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,659
Look! You did not find the foreigner first!

347
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:26,959
That fat kid found him first!

348
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:33,559
What?

349
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:35,659
How did you know?

350
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:39,459
How did you know that Genta found Mr. Rutger first?

351
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:40,459
Oh!

352
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,859
Takagi, did you tell him about it?

353
00:17:42,859 --> 00:17:45,859
No, sir. I haven't told him yet.

354
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,659
No.

355
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:50,559
No! I didn't do it!

356
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,259
Yeah! It was the voice!

357
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:53,959
It was that kid's voice!

358
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:56,659
I heard that kid's scream!

359
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,159
-You could not hear that. -What?

360
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:01,959
Remember you said you were listening to the horse race

361
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:04,059
on the radio at top volume inside your car,

362
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:07,359
so you couldn't notice anything outside?

363
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:10,659
If that so, then you could not have been able to hear Genta's scream.

364
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:13,859
But you said you know that he found Mr. Rutger first?

365
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:17,859
I told you, I saw it!

366
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:20,259
I saw this kid kicking the ball alone.

367
00:18:20,259 --> 00:18:22,259
So you know,

368
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:23,659
maybe I was unable to hear,

369
00:18:23,659 --> 00:18:26,059
but I could see what was happening outside the car, right?

370
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:27,759
Right, Inspector?

371
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:30,259
Sure, that's true.

372
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:33,659
But how did you know that Genta found Mr. Rutger?

373
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:36,659
Genta was just kicking the ball, right?

374
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:37,959
Sure I know!

375
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:39,059
Because at that time...

376
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:42,059
-At that time, you said? -Well...

377
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,259
It was this, wasn't it?

378
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:53,559
At that time, when you hit Mr. Rutger with a steel pipe.

379
00:18:56,259 --> 00:18:59,759
You saw this soccer ball come, right?

380
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:03,159
That's why you knew Genta was kicking the ball

381
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:05,759
and would be coming to get the ball.

382
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:08,459
No, I was...

383
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:10,459
I was listening to the horse race on the radio...

384
00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:12,859
Then tell me.

385
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:15,659
Tell me the name of the horse that won the main race today.

386
00:19:15,659 --> 00:19:18,759
-What? -You must know it if you were staying here

387
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:21,059
and listening to the radio relay of the horse race!

388
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,059
The main race was on

389
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:26,059
at the time we came back here.

390
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:28,759
Well, that's...

391
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:31,359
I understand that you don't remember

392
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:35,759
because you didn't have time to listen to the horse race on the radio.

393
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,959
You wanted to leave this parking lot as soon as possible,

394
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:42,559
and so headed to the exit with your car.

395
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,859
But guess what?

396
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:47,059
Mr. Genda was stranded at the gate

397
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:50,859
and somebody could not leave this parking lot.

398
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:53,759
You went back to where you were

399
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:59,359
and started listening to the horse race on the radio at top volume,

400
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,359
so you can pretend that you didn't notice anything about the case.

401
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:09,259
I suppose you were totally panicked at that time.

402
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:16,159
No.

403
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:20,059
No...

404
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:22,259
I didn't do it...

405
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:23,559
Hey! Wait.

406
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:31,259
I got stuck here all because of you.

407
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:33,359
No. You can't do that.

408
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:35,459
Mr. Genda!

409
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:37,259
Mr. Genda.

410
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:38,859
What have you done?

411
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:43,759
You don't have to thank me.

412
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:46,659
I just wanted to do it.

413
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:15,459
"Cafe Poirot"

414
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,759
Really?

415
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:20,759
So that guy committed the crime for the money.

416
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:21,759
Yeah.

417
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:26,959
Detective Takagi called Doc and told him about that, I heard.

418
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:28,959
He's been running away from debt collectors.

419
00:22:28,959 --> 00:22:31,959
Opportunity made him a criminal, he said.

420
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:37,659
Japanese crimes are becoming Americanized, right?

421
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:41,259
Anyway, I'm happy because Genta wasn't the criminal!

422
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,759
Yeah.

423
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:46,659
It felt like a living eel on a cooking board.

424
00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:49,559
What was this foreigner thinking though anyway?

425
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:52,759
He pointed at a child and said "criminal"...

426
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:54,559
Yeah, I know.

427
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,459
Hi there!

428
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:01,659
What if Genta happened to be the criminal...

429
00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:03,459
I trusted them.

430
00:23:03,459 --> 00:23:04,459
What?

431
00:23:04,459 --> 00:23:06,959
I trusted these little detectives.

432
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:08,559
Mr. Rutger!

433
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:11,759
Is your head okay?

434
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:12,959
Yeah, kind of.

435
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,459
Thank god!

436
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:16,959
Is he the German guy?

437
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:19,259
Looks like it.

438
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:20,959
I'm sorry, sonny.

439
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:22,059
Yeah.

440
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:24,859
As a token of my appreciation, I brought this today.

441
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:28,459
It's that cheesecake!

442
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:30,759
Wow, that looks nice!

443
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:33,359
I really wanted to eat this!

444
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:35,659
You know, I happened to miss it at that time, right?

445
00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:38,059
I bought it because I thought so.

446
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:40,259
He already knew, Genta.

447
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:41,759
Thank you.

448
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:44,459
Oh, please.

449
00:23:44,459 --> 00:23:47,259
How come such a dark horse won the race?

450
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,859
This was supposed to be an easy bet!

451
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:51,859
-Hey. -What?

452
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:54,159
The strong one doesn't win.

453
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,559
The one who wins is strong!

454
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:58,959
What?

455
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:48,559
Next Conan's Hint:

456
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,959
"A Live TV Show"

457
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:53,359
Next episode is a live!

458
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,559
It's the first attempt in Japanese Anime history, right?

459
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,859
Just kidding.
