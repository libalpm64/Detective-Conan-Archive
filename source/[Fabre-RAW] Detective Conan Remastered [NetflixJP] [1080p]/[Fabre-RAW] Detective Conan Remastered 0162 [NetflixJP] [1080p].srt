1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,820
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,320
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,120
Today's episode is special. It's the start of Conan

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,920
and Shinichi's era, the very first mystery.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,520
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,420
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,920
His name is Detective Conan.

8
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:42,170
"Flying Coffin - Shinichi's First Case"

9
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,770
"Narita Airport"

10
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,270
Look, that's the one. That's the plane we're riding.

11
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,870
It's so big.

12
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,770
Boeing 747.

13
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:00,370
It's a jumbo jet total length, 70.7 meters.

14
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,570
Seriously.

15
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,170
Why's a famous private detective like Kogoro Mouri

16
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,170
have to babysit a bunch of kids on his trip to Okinawa?

17
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,870
You have your nerve.

18
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:14,370
Last night you were saying, "Wait for me, my little beach angel".

19
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,670
I didn't know these brats were coming along.

20
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,770
Good grief.

21
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,370
Doctor Agasa entered a contest on the internet

22
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,770
and won this trip to Okinawa. That's why we're able to go.

23
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,370
Just be grateful you can go along.

24
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,870
Yes.

25
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,770
I don't see that lucky professor anywhere, do you?

26
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,770
Now that you mention it.

27
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,770
The professor's not coming.

28
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,070
I just called him

29
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,170
and he said he came down with a cold and won't be able to go.

30
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,370
What?

31
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,570
But I don't think it's too bad.

32
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,070
He asked me to buy a lot of gifts.

33
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,770
What about Ai?

34
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,170
She said she'll pass because she's taking care of the professor.

35
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,070
Oh, I see.

36
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,970
Then let's buy her a lot of souvenirs.

37
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,770
The houses are getting smaller and smaller.

38
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,870
Conan, look.

39
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,170
Are you sleeping?

40
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,070
He was up all night reading.

41
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,170
What're you smiling about?

42
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:41,070
I'm just thinking about the plane ride last year.

43
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:45,070
Shinichi fell asleep too, right after we took off.

44
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,170
Oh, I remember that's when I won a trip at the neighborhood drawing

45
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:53,570
and while I was gone, you and that kid detective ran off to Los Angeles.

46
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,470
How many times do I have to tell you?

47
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,070
We just went to visit his parents.

48
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,270
Kids just in high school don't go off on overseas trips.

49
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,270
At least not normal kids.

50
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:09,570
Well that's because his parents sent me a ticket too.

51
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:15,870
He didn't try to do anything funny, did he?

52
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,270
What do you mean by anything funny?

53
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,670
Well, you know...

54
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,770
I mean, how do I say this?

55
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,070
You kids, sit down.

56
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,570
Of all the...

57
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,870
Excuse me.

58
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,570
What? Who, me?

59
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,770
Do you mind not smoking?

60
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,070
This is a no-smoking section.

61
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,670
"Tsuneo Ukai (47)" -It's bothering the other passengers.

62
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,670
If you want to smoke,

63
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,070
please do it in the smoking section in the rear of the plane.

64
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,870
"Kazuhiro Otaka (29), Photographer" -Sorry about that.

65
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,870
I'll try to be careful next time.

66
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,170
"Tsugumi Amano (27), Photographer"

67
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,370
For goodness sake, Kazuhiro, stop that.

68
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,870
Why you?

69
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,270
That's not a way to talk to your soon to be a filthy rich boyfriend.

70
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,870
Watch yourself.

71
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,670
Kazuhiro...

72
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,170
Come on. Be happy.

73
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,670
The newspaper company over there said

74
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:32,370
they'd pay a lot of money for these negatives.

75
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,070
If they're real, right?

76
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,770
They're supposed...

77
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,870
"Chizuru Tachikawa (29), Photographer" -to be scandal shots

78
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,570
of a powerful American senator when he was in Japan

79
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,570
but it'd be embarrassing if they were of somebody else.

80
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,270
You've got to be kidding.

81
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:52,070
I already faxed 2 copies of the pictures over there

82
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,870
and got it confirmed.

83
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,570
It doesn't matter, just remember, we're on vacation.

84
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,270
Your negatives come second.

85
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,870
Alright already.

86
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,770
I'll show you some really great surfing moves.

87
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,570
Right, Washinuma?

88
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,370
"Noboru Washinuma (30), Photographer" -What's with him?

89
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,270
He's sleeping already.

90
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,870
Oh, well, I guess I'll get some rest, too.

91
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,370
Good night.

92
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:24,170
"Edward Crow, Freelance journalist"

93
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,070
Yes. May I help you?

94
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,470
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,070
I seem to have gotten airsick,

96
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,770
do you have motion sickness pills?

97
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,970
Yes. I'll be right back.

98
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,070
Sir, may I help you?

99
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:01,870
I don't like flying, being box in makes me restless.

100
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,270
I have an idea. Could you do me a favor?

101
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,670
Yes, what is it?

102
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,270
Hey, are you alright?

103
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,370
I think I'm airsick..

104
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,670
The stewardess is getting some medicine.

105
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,270
Did you drink the motion sickness pills I gave you?

106
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,070
That's strange. I gave some to Noboru, too.

107
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,270
And it seems to be working.

108
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,770
How about if we switch seats?

109
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,370
Maybe sitting by the window will make you feel better.

110
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,270
What?

111
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,870
Here, the medicine's for her.

112
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,170
Here you are.

113
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,170
Thank you.

114
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,970
Here, your pills.

115
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,470
I just noticed, where'd Kazuhiro go?

116
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,270
He got up a while ago and went somewhere.

117
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:00,370
I wonder if he didn't feel good and went to the toilet.

118
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,770
Hey, you in there. Hey.

119
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,170
Excuse me, is something the matter?

120
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,170
I've been knocking a long time

121
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,670
but whoever's inside doesn't answer.

122
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,670
Excuse me? Hello?

123
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,870
Excuse me.

124
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,470
Are you feeling ill...

125
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,870
What was that scream?

126
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,070
It came from the rear.

127
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,470
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please.

128
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,670
A passenger has become seriously ill.

129
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,670
If there is a doctor or nurse on board,

130
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,670
please contact the nearest cabin attendant.

131
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,670
Excuse me.

132
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,070
Yes?

133
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,570
Megure of the Metropolitan Police Department.

134
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,970
Is someone really ill?

135
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,670
Well, the truth is...

136
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,270
I went for a look. Somebody's dead.

137
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,870
-Really? -Yeah.

138
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,770
Inside the toilet in the back.

139
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,770
Hey, come on, wake up.

140
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,870
Something terrible has happened...

141
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,970
I don't believe it.

142
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,970
-Where is he? -Why? Ran, is that you?

143
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,870
Taking a trip on the long weekend?

144
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,370
Well...

145
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,070
Never mind me. I just heard someone was dead.

146
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,070
Calm down, we're about to look into that now.

147
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,770
No one has touched the body, have they?

148
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:43,270
Well, actually a strange young boy has been hanging around.

149
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,070
A strange young boy?

150
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,470
Cause of death

151
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,170
is probably suffocation due to damage to the cervical pith.

152
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,870
The murder weapon is probably something

153
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,370
with a sharp point like an ice pick.

154
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,870
Before the victim was stabbed,

155
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,970
there's a possibility he was forced to inhale something

156
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,370
knocking him unconscious.

157
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,970
Who would do such a thing?

158
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,370
We don't know that yet.

159
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,970
But don't worry,

160
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,370
the killer is still flying over the Pacific Ocean

161
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,970
inside this huge metal can,

162
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,770
the killer won't get away.

163
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,170
Hey. Who the heck are you?

164
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,170
That's right.

165
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,970
This is the beginning.

166
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,470
Shinichi Kudo. I'm a detective.

167
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,770
This was Shinichi's first case.

168
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,000
Kudo?

169
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,400
You couldn't be Yusakuls...

170
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,100
It's been a long time, Inspector Megure.

171
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,300
You're his son, Shinichi.

172
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,900
You're the splitting image of your father when he was a boy.

173
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,700
The last time I saw you, you were in the 6th grade.

174
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,700
You certainly have grown.

175
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,200
But that's beside the point.

176
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,300
I'm sure you just became a high school student, didn't you?

177
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,500
You shouldn't be disturbing the crime scene.

178
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,300
Excuse me, could you borrow someone's camera and bring it here?

179
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,000
I'd like to photograph the crime scene.

180
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,700
Well... if it's photos, that boy already took some.

181
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,800
He what?

182
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,700
I took about 60 of them.

183
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,000
I borrowed a camera from one of the passengers.

184
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,200
Also...

185
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,900
We did as he asked and kept a close eye on what he did, but...

186
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,800
We didn't notice him hide or wipe anything

187
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,800
or do anything the least bit suspicious.

188
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,400
But if an amateur handles the body,

189
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,700
the stiffened muscles could be damaged

190
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,500
throwing the estimated time of death off.

191
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,600
Based on the condition of the death spots

192
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,300
and the fact that the jaw had started stiffening.

193
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,300
He was dead about 1 or 2 hours.

194
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,100
Three things struck me as odd.

195
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,600
First, a few drops of blood

196
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,100
had flown onto the wall the victim was leaning on,

197
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,900
but the clothing pressed against it wasn't stained.

198
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,400
Second, the scratch-like marks

199
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,200
to the lower right of the fatal wound.

200
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:24,000
Third, and the inside of his left pants pocket was soaked.

201
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,600
But the victim's hands were dry.

202
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,200
Even if he stuck his wet hands into the pockets,

203
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,800
they wouldn't get as wet as that.

204
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,700
Which means, someone for some reason wet it deliberately.

205
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,600
Listen you! You just keep out of this.

206
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,100
Let the police handle the rest.

207
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,300
Excuse me, please go and wake that fellow

208
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,200
who's sleeping next to my seat.

209
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,900
He's with the police, too.

210
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,100
Yes, sir.

211
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,800
Come here. What do you mean, "I'm a detective"?

212
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,000
You're just a high school student.

213
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I didn't have a choice, did I?

214
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,700
They wouldn't have let me examine the body if I didn't say that.

215
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,700
The thing is, you shouldn't go off Iike that without telling me.

216
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,900
I was worried that you were the victim.

217
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,200
I have no interest in waking a girl who looks like a fool

218
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,600
when she's asleep.

219
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,900
What do you mean looks like a fool?

220
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,600
Like this...

221
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,400
Inspector.

222
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,800
You're late, Takagi.

223
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,400
A murder?

224
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,000
Yes.

225
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,200
Cause of death is suffocation due to damage to the cervical pith.

226
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,500
The murder weapon

227
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,600
is something that looks like an ice pick with a pointed tip.

228
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,200
Judging from rigor mortis and the death spots of the body,

229
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,900
he's probably been dead about 1-2 hours.

230
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,800
An empty bottle and handkerchief.

231
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,600
It seems the killer carried this handkerchief

232
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,200
soaked in something Iike chloroform in this bottle

233
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,900
and used it to knock the victim out

234
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,600
just before killing him.

235
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,400
Yes.

236
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,500
Excuse me, I'd like to save the evidence,

237
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,200
may I have a plastic bag or something?

238
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,900
Is something wrong?

239
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,400
It's just amazing,

240
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,200
you're doing the same things that young boy did.

241
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,900
What boy?

242
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,800
You know, he was standing in the doorway.

243
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,800
The one in the black sweater.

244
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,900
Who is he?

245
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,400
He's the son of a friend of mine,

246
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,400
whenever I got to a dead end on a case, I'd go to my friend,

247
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Who's a mystery writer, for advice.

248
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,300
When he was little, he'd come to the crime scene with his father

249
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,000
and wander around.

250
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,800
But who'd have thought he'd acquire enough

251
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,700
to expertly analyze a crime scene.

252
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,000
He's going to be a great help.

253
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,400
You fool! He's a civilian.

254
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,800
He's just a kid in high school

255
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,600
who thinks he's a great detective

256
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
because he's read a lot of mysteries and medical books.

257
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,600
At any rate, find us some witnesses.

258
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,800
There are 4 suspects.

259
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,900
There were 4 others, excluding the victim,

260
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,400
who were in the toilet at that time.

261
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,200
My seat is in the rear of the cabin.

262
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,800
I'd been watching

263
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,100
but no one came to the smoking section in the back.

264
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,500
That you can be sure of.

265
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,800
You were watching it? Were you up all night?

266
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,600
Well, I couldn't sleep.

267
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Why, for heaven's sake?

268
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,700
I thought you fell asleep as soon as we got on the plane.

269
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,400
Is that so?

270
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,900
Oh boy, you're like a baby, going to bed early

271
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,100
and getting up in the middle of the night.

272
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,100
Nuts.

273
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,400
How can I sleep with you sleeping so soundly next to me like that?

274
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,900
I'm not all that mature yet.

275
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,900
Alright then. How about telling us who those 4 are?

276
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,600
Sure.

277
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,100
Let's see. Those four people are...

278
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,800
This girl, and the girl next to her.

279
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,400
And the man in this seat across the aisle.

280
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,100
And this man in the front seat, these four.

281
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,900
Yes.

282
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,200
Wait just a minute.

283
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
What's going on?

284
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,000
Kazuhiro.

285
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,000
Why... why...

286
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,800
Tsugumi.

287
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,200
Why was Kazuhiro killed?

288
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,100
That's what we're trying to find out.

289
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,100
Maybe that negative is responsible?

290
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,600
Negatives?

291
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,500
He was bragging about it.

292
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,700
He said he was going to sell it to a newspaper company

293
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,700
and make a lot of money.

294
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,700
Don't tell me they're gone?

295
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,700
He didn't have them on him?

296
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,500
That can't be...

297
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,400
So that means the killer

298
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,300
is someone who knew about the negatives, isn't that right?

299
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,500
Everyone in this business knew about it.

300
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,200
He offered to sell them to a lot of newspaper companies.

301
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,000
Hey, officers.

302
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,800
Ohtaka was stabbed once in the back of the head, wasn't he?

303
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,000
-That's right. -Then the killer's a pro.

304
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,300
Those two are just camerawomen.

305
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,200
You're barking up the wrong tree, suspecting them.

306
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,900
No, with a little medical knowledge

307
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,600
about anesthetic and with a murder weapon,

308
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,600
anyone could have done it. Even a woman.

309
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,200
Now then. Why don't the four of you tell us

310
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,600
what you saw when you went to the toilet?

311
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,400
I went to the toilet because I wasn't feeling well,

312
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
but when I got back to my seat,

313
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,300
Kazuhiro was still there in his seat.

314
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,800
I called the stewardess later to bring me some medicine.

315
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,900
That's why I remember it well.

316
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,000
Is that true?

317
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,300
Yes, he was asleep when I saw him.

318
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,800
Yes, I saw her from across the aisle.

319
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,600
It looked like she was asking for some medicine..

320
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,500
I went to the toilet right after that,

321
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,000
I was in there for about 5 minutes, I guess.

322
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,800
You said across the aisle,

323
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,100
but isn't your seat facing the same aisle as the victim's seat?

324
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,600
I get restless having to sit still for long periods of time,

325
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,400
so I was walking around.

326
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,000
Then when did the victim leave his seat?

327
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
When I brought the water and pills, he was already gone.

328
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,400
I don't think it took me more than a minute to bring them to her.

329
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,700
I went to the toilet after Tsugumi got her medicine

330
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,900
and I guess it was 20 minutes later

331
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:52,100
that I noticed Kazuhiro still hadn't come back, so I went to check.

332
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,100
But he was still alive then.

333
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,100
Well, I knocked on this door and asked if he was alright

334
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,300
and he knocked back.

335
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,100
Are you sure?

336
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,300
But how did you know it was him?

337
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,600
It had to be.

338
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,600
I opened the other three doors and they were unoccupied.

339
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,800
So he's the only one left.

340
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,900
When did you go to the toilets?

341
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,800
Sorry, I don't remember, unfortunately.

342
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,300
He said he doesn't remember.

343
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,600
I guess it's only natural...

344
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,900
What's wrong?

345
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,400
That man's cologne is so strong...

346
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,300
Oh, come on, how much longer are you going to keep asking

347
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,700
those meaningless questions?

348
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,300
Whoever has the weapon is the killer, right?

349
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,300
Then, wouldn't it be quicker

350
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,400
to do a search of their things and their bodies?

351
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,100
This has nothing to do with me though since I was asleep

352
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,100
and didn't go to the toilet.

353
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,200
You're lying. I saw you leave your seat.

354
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,300
What?

355
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,700
Your seat is directly behind the victim's, isn't it?

356
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,200
What are you talking about?

357
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,500
Remember? I told you when I went to the toilet,

358
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,600
the victim was still asleep in his seat.

359
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,900
Well, I'm positive this man's seat was empty.

360
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,800
Hey, old man, don't lie.

361
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,400
You four were the ones who went to the toilet,

362
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,300
he just said so.

363
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,700
Right, kid?

364
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,300
Yes, well...

365
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,300
What's the matter? Don't be vague.

366
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,700
Now that I think about it. I think I was distracted for a second.

367
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,100
At any rate, you five are considered suspects,

368
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,400
so we will search your luggage,

369
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,600
and you will undergo a body check in the toilet.

370
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,100
What?

371
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,500
You didn't find the weapon on them or their luggage?

372
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,900
No. None of them had anything Iike an icepick.

373
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,800
To be on the safe side, we're searching places in the plane

374
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,200
that it could be hidden in.

375
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,400
Hey. You're positive these people were the only ones

376
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,300
who went to the toilet, aren't you?

377
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,700
Shinichi, answer him. Shinichi!

378
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,700
This is getting interesting.

379
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,100
If they can't find the weapon in the plane,

380
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,700
that means the killer still has it somewhere.

381
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,300
I'll bet that's the killer's trump card.

382
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,800
I'll find it.

383
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
I'll get that trump card.

384
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,800
Before this huge metal bird rests its wings.

385
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,130
What?

386
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,630
You want us to look again?

387
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:49,930
You want us to do another body check and go through their luggage

388
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,730
one more time?

389
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:54,730
Is that what you're saying, Shinichi?

390
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,130
Yes.

391
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,830
If you couldn't find the weapon in the cabin,

392
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,730
the killer could still have it in their possession.

393
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,830
Inspector Megure.

394
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:10,530
First, Miss Tachikawa's bag.

395
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,930
Passport, wallet,

396
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,830
handkerchief and cosmetics.

397
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,430
Tissue and her boarding pass.

398
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,030
Sunglasses, camera,

399
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,730
notepad and a ballpoint pen.

400
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:23,230
That's it. Nothing resembling a weapon is in here.

401
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,730
How about that pen?

402
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,730
Did you check inside the pen?

403
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,530
Of course.

404
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:34,630
Alright then, next is Miss Amano.

405
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,630
Yes.

406
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,830
Passport, wallet,

407
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,130
handkerchief, knit hat

408
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:44,130
boading pass, camera, cosmetics and a sewing set,

409
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,730
a few motion sickness pills.

410
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,130
The only sharp instrument

411
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:52,130
would be the tiny sewing scissors and needles in this.

412
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,630
But you couldn't kill anyone like that with these, it's impossible.

413
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,430
Next.

414
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,330
Mr. Ukai.

415
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,730
Yes, sir.

416
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,430
Passport and boarding pass,

417
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,030
wallet, handkerchief,

418
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,430
razor, towel,

419
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,730
and shavin cream.

420
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,430
Next is Mr. Edward.

421
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:15,230
Let us check your belongings just in case.

422
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,730
Well, if you must, you must...

423
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,730
He'll cooperate.

424
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,930
Go ahead.

425
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,730
That's strange.

426
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:32,730
The cologne on his neck was very strong

427
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:34,930
but he doesn't have any on his hands?

428
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,030
Passport, wallet,

429
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,630
handkerchief, boarding pass,

430
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,230
towel, newspaper,

431
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,830
two paperback books, glasses box,

432
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,230
sewing set,

433
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:48,430
American National Bank chequebook.

434
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,430
Excuse me, Mr. Edward,

435
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,030
could you explain this chequebook...

436
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,030
Mr. Edward, I would like to ask you a few questions

437
00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:00,030
about the chequebook in your briefcase.

438
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:03,430
It's for my job, I intended to buy some art objects

439
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:07,330
at an auction in Japan, but nothing caught my eye.

440
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,830
He said he was going to buy some art objects

441
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,130
sold at an auction here in Japan,

442
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,430
but since he didn't find anything interesting, he stopped payment.

443
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,730
I see.

444
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,530
Alright, the last.

445
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,630
Here.

446
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,830
I'm the last one.

447
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,830
Passport, wallet,

448
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,030
handkerchief, camera and negatives.

449
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,630
Wristwatch, cigarettes,

450
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:34,330
lighter and boarding pass, medicine for air sickness.

451
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,430
You seem to have a lot of medicine.

452
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,730
I get air sick very easily.

453
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,130
Both Chizuru and Tsugumi gave me some.

454
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,930
-Right? -Yes.

455
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,730
May I see these negatives for a little while?

456
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,830
Why you...

457
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:57,130
The man in this picture.

458
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:01,130
Isn't it Mr. Dickson, the American senator?

459
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:04,230
Why you're right. He's with a woman in this picture.

460
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,330
-Hey. That's enough -Wait a minute,

461
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,630
those are the same as Kazuhiro's.

462
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,830
The same, you mean...

463
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:14,430
And if they're in your possession. That means...

464
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,430
No, no. Wait.

465
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:20,830
These are definitely mine.

466
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,430
Ohtaka and I were staked out at the hotel together,

467
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,730
we both took those photos.

468
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,030
They're...

469
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:29,430
not as good as Ohtaka's

470
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,430
but I was going to a newspaper in Los Angeles

471
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:35,330
and sell my pictures, too.

472
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:39,330
Besides, you should find the weapon before accusing me.

473
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,830
Now, we'll listen to all your complaints

474
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,830
after the body check.

475
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,830
Now, ladies and gentlemen, just like before,

476
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,330
I want you to come to the toilet one by one.

477
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,630
The women will be examined by the stewardess

478
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:52,130
and we will examine the men.

479
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,330
So this is where the victim sat.

480
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,830
According to the seat numbers on the boarding pass,

481
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,730
Mr. Washinuma was behind him and Mr. Crow in the front.

482
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:10,330
Miss Amano to the right and Miss Tachikawa on the inside.

483
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:13,630
And across the aisle to the left is Mr. Ukai.

484
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,130
Why this is.

485
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,430
A piece of a negative.

486
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:26,530
What is something like this doing beside Mr. Wshinuma's seat?

487
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,530
Shinichi.

488
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,430
They're done with the body checks.

489
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:36,230
It seems no one had the weapon.

490
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,030
Which means that's the only answer...

491
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,330
There, you see. We didn't have the weapon.

492
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,530
I had to undress twice.

493
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,330
I don't want to go through this again.

494
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,730
What shall we do, inspector?

495
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:54,330
We've searched everywhere.

496
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,030
No, not quite everywhere.

497
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,130
What?

498
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:00,230
There's still one place we haven't searched.

499
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:04,830
Inside the victim's bags.

500
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,540
Which one is his?

501
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,340
It's that black bag in the back.

502
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,640
Is something wrong?

503
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:32,140
No. I just remembered something strange he said.

504
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,340
Something strange?

505
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:38,840
It was about a week ago, he said he forgot his bag at the studio

506
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,040
and someone cut it to shreds.

507
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,040
That's why he bought a new one

508
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,340
for this trip.

509
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,340
Maybe someone was after those negatives.

510
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,940
That's why it happened.

511
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:01,440
Passport, camera, film, sunglasses, 3 packs of cigarettes,

512
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,340
wallet, towel, 2 magazines, boarding pass and a wristwatch.

513
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:09,340
Nothing that appears to be the weapons.

514
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,840
Shinichi.

515
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,540
Really?

516
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,340
What's this? Kazuhiro Ohtaka.

517
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,740
Mr. Ohtaka, is he the fellow who won

518
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,940
the Nichiuri Newspaper's Photo contest 3 years ago?

519
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,840
Well, yes. That's him.

520
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,140
I knew it.

521
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,640
What is it, Takagi?

522
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,140
Look, it's that picture of a mother trapped in the fire,

523
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,640
she's handing her daughter

524
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,140
to the fireman on the ladder.

525
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,140
Forget about that. That's not the issue here.

526
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,940
Are we or aren't we cleared? Which is it?

527
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:53,940
But you four were the only ones who went to the toilet

528
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,240
at the time the crime was committed.

529
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,240
That boy gave the statement.

530
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,540
I'll bet that kid who thinks he's a detective

531
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,740
fell asleep and missed a couple of people.

532
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,740
It seems you've read a lot of books and did a lot of studying

533
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,740
but this is a real murder.

534
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,440
It's not like your book.

535
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,540
Children should behave,

536
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,640
go back to your seat and take a nap.

537
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,240
Shinichi, why don't you say something?

538
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,840
What is it with this case?

539
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,040
The weapon can't be found

540
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,140
and all their alibis just don't add up.

541
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,740
How about telling us the truth?

542
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,740
What?

543
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,040
It's you, isn't it? You killed him.

544
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,240
Hey, come on now.

545
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,840
The only one among all of us obviously telling a lie is you.

546
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,340
I saw you.

547
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,840
When this girl was asking the stewardess for medicine,

548
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,640
the victim was asleep and your seat in the back of him was empty.

549
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,040
You're a liar.

550
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,440
I am not lying. The truth is... the truth is we both...

551
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,940
There... that's the stewardess.

552
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,840
She and l that stewardess is my witness.

553
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,440
And that's his statement.

554
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,340
Is it true?

555
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:21,140
Yes, this passenger was wandering around the cabin,

556
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,840
so I called out to him.

557
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,740
He asked me to caution a passenger

558
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,240
in the non-smoking section who was smoking.

559
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,240
And? Was this man in this seat when you got there?

560
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,140
No, I don't believe so.

561
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,440
Hey, you. Are you blind or something?

562
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,240
You were the one who brought the medicine, weren't you?

563
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,540
Yes.

564
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:48,140
You saw me sleeping in my seat, didn't you?

565
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:52,940
No, I don't remember clearly.

566
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,440
What?

567
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,540
Excuse me, when you brought the medicine,

568
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,640
could it be possible that...

569
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,540
Could that have happened?

570
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:08,440
Yes, that's right. But I thought it was my imagination.

571
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,140
There's no doubt about it.

572
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,440
That's the killer.

573
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,440
That'll explain, everyone, except the killer's story

574
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,440
and why a piece of negative was on the seat,

575
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,040
the unexplainable blood on the toilet wall,

576
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:29,340
and why the victim's pocket was wet.

577
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,240
But why?

578
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,940
Why didn't the killer have the weapon?

579
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,640
Because it couldn't be gotten rid of. Is that possible?

580
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,240
Is it something the owner would miss if it was gone?

581
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,540
Wait a minute, I just realized that person did...

582
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,240
Hey. Shinichi, Inspector Megure's calling you.

583
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,240
He wants you to go around the cabin

584
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,940
and see if anyone else went to the toilet.

585
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:01,840
Never mind that. Ran, you're in high school, aren't you?

586
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,440
What? Of course, I am.

587
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,640
Then let me ask you...

588
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,340
What?

589
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:17,940
Tell me quick. I'm embarrassed to ask this.

590
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:22,440
Yes, that's right. Most of them are like that now.

591
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,640
I see. So that's what it was.

592
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,840
What do you mean by that?

593
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,640
Why do you look so satisfied?

594
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,040
I finally figured it out.

595
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,340
I know what the killer's trump card is.

596
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,640
What was used to snuff the life out of the victim?

597
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,440
At any rate, the only one who acted suspiciously

598
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,040
is Mr. Washinuma, only you.

599
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,740
No...

600
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,040
You're wrong, Inspector Megure.

601
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,840
He's not the killer.

602
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,640
He was never near the crime scene

603
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,740
so his chances of being the killer are zero.

604
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,140
But...

605
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,640
See? What a relief.

606
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,140
I had nothing to do with all of this.

607
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,740
No, that's not exactly true.

608
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,440
Mr. Washinuma.

609
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,840
You were taken advantage of without you knowing.

610
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,840
By a person in that group.

611
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,440
The one person who gave false testimony,

612
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,240
the killer.

613
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,040
Which means, inspector,

614
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,640
it was Miss Tachikawa who said she went to the toilet

615
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,240
to check on the victim and knocked on the door

616
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,840
and got a knock in reply.

617
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,340
Wait just a minute.

618
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,540
No, she wasn't lying.

619
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:46,040
There really was someone inside the toilet at that time...

620
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,140
Inside with the victim.

621
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,640
Mr. Crow. Yes, you.

622
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,140
Are you sure about that?

623
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:59,540
He put his hand into Mr. Ohtaka's pocket looking for the negatives

624
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:04,640
and realized the cologne on his wrist rubbed onto the pants.

625
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,540
So he hurriedly washed his hands to wash the cologne off,

626
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,640
then he wet his handkerchief

627
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,640
to wipe the telltale scent from the pants.

628
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,340
The proof is, there's no cologne on his wrist.

629
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,740
That's not what I'd consider proof.

630
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:24,540
Besides, to get his statement, we'll have to ask him in English.

631
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,140
No, he speaks Japanese.

632
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,440
Isn't that right, Mr. Crow?

633
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,440
The boy's right.

634
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,440
He spoke...

635
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,240
Japanese.

636
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,840
Of course he did.

637
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,740
He intended to buy those negatives

638
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:47,740
with the check from the National Bank.

639
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,240
Buy?

640
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,140
That's right.

641
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:56,440
Senator Dickson himself asked me to.

642
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,340
So was it you? Did you kill Ohtaka?

643
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,440
No, he's not the killer.

644
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:07,240
Because when he went into the toilet, Mr. Ohtaka was already dead.

645
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,340
What was that?

646
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,740
Isn't that right, Mr. Crow?

647
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,440
Yes, when I heard he had gone to the toilet.

648
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,440
I thought it was my chance to make a deal with him.

649
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,540
But there was no answer when I knocked

650
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,940
so I opened the door and went in.

651
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,840
He was dead.

652
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:32,140
Of course, I didn't get the negatives.

653
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:35,040
Then it was you who answered my knock?

654
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,340
Yes.

655
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,040
Hey, don't be fooled by this.

656
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,040
He's just confirming that kid's guesswork.

657
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,840
Guesswork? Absolutely not.

658
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,440
There were bloodstains on the toilet wall,

659
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,740
yet there was no blood on the victim's back,

660
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,940
although he was leaning on the stains.

661
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,740
This indicates someone else moved the body

662
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:04,240
after some time had passed.

663
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,840
Someone who found the body but didn't notify anyone.

664
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,740
The only reason I can come up with for moving the body is,

665
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:12,140
to look for those negatives.

666
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:15,940
But unable to find them, the person searched his pants pocket.

667
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,240
The only one who would do that

668
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,040
would be someone sitting in front of the victim.

669
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,240
Someone who couldn't see what the victim was doing,

670
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,740
that could only be Mr. Crow.

671
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,340
Yes, I get it.

672
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,040
Alright then, who did it? Who's the killer?

673
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,940
We have now eliminated Mr. Crow,

674
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,440
Miss Tachikawa who was outside knocking on the door.

675
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:40,540
Which leaves us Mr Ukai and Miss Amano.

676
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,840
This is the crucial point.

677
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:50,240
Mr. Ukai testified that when Miss Amano asked for the medicine,

678
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,140
Mr. Washinuma's seat behind the victim was unoccupied.

679
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,140
I'm sure about that.

680
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:00,140
And I'm telling you, I was there all along, sleeping.

681
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:05,240
He's right. Mr. Washinuma was asleep in his seat.

682
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,840
The killer put a knit cap on his head

683
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,640
and covered his eyes with an eye mask.

684
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,640
What was that...

685
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,640
That style. Do you mean...

686
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,540
That's right, that is Mr. Ohtaka's sleeping style.

687
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,040
After killing him, instead of return to their own seat,

688
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,840
the killer sat next to Mr. Washinuma

689
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,440
and made him up to look like Mr. Ohtaka,

690
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,240
then called the stewardess.

691
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:31,140
To give the illusion Mr. Ohtaka was still alive at that time.

692
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,940
Hold it, you mean...

693
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,540
I don't believe it.

694
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,640
That's right.

695
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,040
The person responsible for killing Mr. Ohtaka

696
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,540
and using Mr. Washinuma to fake an alibi is...

697
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:56,280
Tsugumi Amano! It's you!

698
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,580
No way, he's kidding, right?

699
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,880
Tsugumi?

700
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,580
Well, we can't blame the stewardess for making a mistake.

701
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,280
After all, the cabin was dark.

702
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,080
And the only part of his face not covered by the blanket was the nose up.

703
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,680
While the stewardess was getting the medicine,

704
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,480
Miss Amano went back to her own seat.

705
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,380
Then woke Miss Tachikawa by moaning exaggeratedly.

706
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:28,380
Making sure she noticed Mr.Ohtaka's seat was empty.

707
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,880
This gave Miss Tachikawa and the stewardess the wrong impression

708
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,280
about when Mr Ohtaka went to the toilet.

709
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,680
Then, the empty seat I saw...

710
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,680
Just by chance, there was an empty seat behind Mr. Washinuma.

711
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:45,780
But she wouldn't have been able to use this trick

712
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,580
if the seat was occupied.

713
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:50,480
She made several reservations and unless she cancelled,

714
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,780
the seats would remain empty.

715
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,780
If the medicine she gave Mr. Washinuma was sleeping pills

716
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:59,580
rather than air sickness pills, he wouldn't wake up so easily.

717
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:03,180
The knit cap was in her bag

718
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:08,180
and she knew his habit of using an eye mask,

719
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,480
so there was no problem.

720
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,480
But what if the stewardess noticed

721
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,380
Miss Tachikawa wasn't next to her the first time.

722
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,580
All she had to do was create a camouflage,

723
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,980
drape a blanket over her bag.

724
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,980
I believe she cut the negative into small pieces

725
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,580
with the scissors in the sewing kit

726
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:29,080
and flushed them down the toilet bowl.

727
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,380
The killer wanted us to think the murder was linked to the negative.

728
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,380
Drawing attention away from her.

729
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:38,580
I found a piece of the negative she cut on the seat next to Mr. Washinuma,

730
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,480
it was stuck to her clothes and fell there when she sat down.

731
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,880
-Check it out! -Yes, sir!

732
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,480
This is how it went.

733
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,380
She waited for Miss Tachikawa to fall asleep

734
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,080
and told Mr. Ohtaka she had to talk to him

735
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,680
and told him to wait in the toilet.

736
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,980
Then she got the bottle containing the anesthetic soaked handkerchief

737
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,980
and weapon and headed for the toilet.

738
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,080
As soon as he opened the door.

739
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,680
She pressed the handkerchief over his mouth knocking him unconscious,

740
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,680
then stabbed him in the cervical cord.

741
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,280
After that, she cut the negative up,

742
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,580
flushed it down the toilet bowl and locked the door from the outside.

743
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:17,880
Using this trick... When she returned from the toilet,

744
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,880
it would appear Ohtaka was still alive, alibi was perfect.

745
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:28,580
But what if someone going to the toilet saw her leaving the scene.

746
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:33,580
I'm sure that while committing the crime, she left the door unlocked.

747
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,280
That way, even if someone tried to get in,

748
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,780
it's so narrow in there,

749
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,780
it wouldn't open up if someone held it closed from inside.

750
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,380
And realizing someone was inside,

751
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,680
the person outside would go to another toilet.

752
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,380
That's enough!

753
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,280
After all these accusations, I'm sure you have proof, don't you?

754
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,180
Proof that Tsugumi did it!

755
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,880
I have the murder weapon and the proof

756
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,180
I'm sure she still has it on her!

757
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:08,680
What are you saying? She's had two body checks!

758
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,280
Because it's something we would never suspect.

759
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,680
It'll even pass the metal detector at the airport.

760
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,680
Something only women use.

761
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,580
Something only we use?

762
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:24,180
Ridiculous. Nothing as convenient as that could possibly exist!

763
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:28,480
Tsugumi, you didn't...

764
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,980
Miss Amano, it's the linger you're wearing.

765
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,180
It's the wire under your right breast.

766
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:40,780
A woman couldn't possibly kill anyone with something like that.

767
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:44,780
If you sharpen the end and stick it into the back of the head.

768
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,580
Putting all your strength into it

769
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:49,880
and push it 5 to 6 centimeters into the cervical vertebrae.

770
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,480
The tip will reach the cervical cord,

771
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,180
even a woman could do it.

772
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,680
Along with the fatal injury on Mr Ohtaka's neck.

773
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,980
There were many scratch marks.

774
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,580
That's where the unsharpened end moved and scratched him.

775
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:09,380
The reason Miss Amano didn't get rid of the wire is,

776
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,880
if it was found at the scene,

777
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,780
we would suspect the woman with wire in only one side of her bra.

778
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,980
That's why...

779
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,880
I understand!

780
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,280
We'll just have her go through another body check.

781
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,280
No, Mr. Washinuma. It's no use.

782
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,480
If they search me again, they'll find it.

783
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,180
Tsugumi.

784
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,080
It's true. I killed Kazuhiro.

785
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:44,980
Three years ago, he won the Nichiuri Newspaper's news photo contest.

786
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,480
It was that photo's fault.

787
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,780
What are you saying?

788
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:52,480
That photo's the one that brought you two together, isn't it?

789
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,580
That's right.

790
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:58,180
I became interested in him because of that photo.

791
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,880
I was so impressed that anyone could have captured the ferocity,

792
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,880
the tragedy, the grief of that fire which took my brother's life,

793
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,080
all that emotion in a photo.

794
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:10,080
So why, then?

795
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,980
That photo wasn't the only one he took that day.

796
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,580
I found a mountain of them in his room!

797
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:22,180
Some showed smoke rising from the condominium my brother lived in.

798
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:26,880
And there were so many shots of the condominium before the fire!

799
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,880
You mean, Kazuhiro...

800
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,380
He set the fire himself.

801
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,580
That's right!

802
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:35,280
When I asked him, he practically boasted about it!

803
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,180
You can't just wait around for a great shot to come along.

804
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,580
You have to make it happen.

805
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,880
That's what he said.

806
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,480
I'm so upset.

807
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,080
I was so sure no one would figure out where I hid the murder weapon.

808
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,080
It's the arm you raised.

809
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,680
When you were about to lower his bag from the cabinet,

810
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,580
you raised your left arm and then stopped

811
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,580
but then raised your right arm to take it out.

812
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,280
That's what gave you away.

813
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,080
The sharpened end of the wire must have shifted

814
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,980
and poked into you making you stop, isn't that right?

815
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,480
You mean, a detail that small made you suspect me?

816
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,880
The smallest most likely to be overlooked detail

817
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,180
usually turns out to be the most important.

818
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,880
Your seemingly casual action,

819
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,880
in my eyes, appeared unnatural and thus stuck with me.

820
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,680
Her arm? Did you notice it, inspector?

821
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,380
No, not at all.

822
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,880
By the way, inspector. Why are you going to LA?

823
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:58,880
To pick up a Japanese national on the International wanted list.

824
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,080
I see. So that's what it was about.

825
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,280
That's why you asked me about it.

826
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:40,080
But you said, "Show me your bra".

827
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,780
"There's wire in it, isn't there?"

828
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,580
Is that how you're supposed to ask?

829
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:49,280
That is considered to be sexual harassment, Shinichi.

830
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,580
Oh, no. Don't tell me that Ran's dreaming about that case?

831
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:56,480
Hey! What are you talking about?

832
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,180
Did that creep do something to you?

833
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,680
I wonder what she's dreaming about?

834
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:05,380
I dreamt about stuffing myself with eel on rice.

835
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:09,780
Sir, we will be in the landing position soon,

836
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,680
please return to your seat.

837
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,580
You idiot!

838
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,580
How can you expect me to remain calm when my daughter is suffering?

839
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,880
But, sir...

840
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,180
Hey, what does sexual harassment mean?

841
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,180
How should I know?
