1
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,430
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,230
And step into the essence with strong rhythm.

3
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,730
Today's stage is at a city hotel.

4
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,830
Unique rooms are full of mystery.

5
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,430
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,330
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,630
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:03,390
"The Mystery Of The Retro Room"

9
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,590
"Tohto Monorail"

10
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,490
Dad.

11
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,190
Here, your ticket.

12
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,290
You should come with us to Dolphin Land too, dad.

13
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,990
I'm not going to a dolphin show.

14
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,990
A man's dream is...

15
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,390
the horse derby!

16
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,290
I'll win really big,

17
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,990
and treat you guys to a gorgeous dinner tonight!

18
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:34,090
Be sure you don't run the household finances broke to win though!

19
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,590
I know.

20
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,790
I know!

21
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,490
Yes, okay. Bye, then!

22
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,890
What did Naomi say?

23
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,490
She wants us to hurry over.

24
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,190
Oh, such beautiful ladies!

25
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,390
Are you by chance Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

26
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,890
What? You mean that renowned detective?

27
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,890
That's right.

28
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,290
I can't believe it!

29
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,490
I'm a great fan of yours!

30
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,090
Kaori, cut out your rude attitude!

31
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,190
Oh, no. She's not being rude at all!

32
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,290
We're going to Dolphin Land Hotel,

33
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,990
but where are you headed for, Mr. Mouri?

34
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,690
What a coincidence! I'm going to Dolphin Land, too.

35
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,990
He's going to the horse race track next to it.

36
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:25,590
Excuse me, but do you mind if we go along with you?

37
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,590
Not at all.

38
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,390
Come now, let's go.

39
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,090
I'm sorry, but we have one other person with us.

40
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,290
Kuniko!

41
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,090
Kaori!

42
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,490
I'm sorry, did you wait long?

43
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,390
Another beautiful lady!

44
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,890
It's still early.

45
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,490
You're late!

46
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,290
We're riding the monorail Ieaving at 1:20 pm, aren't we?

47
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,590
We still have 10 minutes.

48
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,990
Huh? Who is he?

49
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,990
He is the renown detective, Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

50
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,890
We ran into him coincidentally.

51
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,890
We used to be classmates of the same university.

52
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,290
"Kuniko Yamamoto (27)" -We had a class reunion last week,

53
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:13,890
but one of our friends who work abroad couldn't come.

54
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,690
She happened to come back to Japan yesterday,

55
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,590
"Kaori Obayashi (27)" -so we decided to have another reunion,

56
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,990
just the four of us.

57
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,590
Which means another beautiful is coming?

58
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,590
Yes. Among all of us,

59
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,690
A queen?

60
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,290
Where? Where is she?

61
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,190
"Kanami Kaneda (27)" -She's staying at the Dolphin Land Hotel.

62
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,990
She's a designer for children's clothes abroad.

63
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,090
So, we have beautiful yet talented designers,

64
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,490
travel agent, and a housewife!

65
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,090
Oh, not really.

66
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,090
He's right.

67
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,990
Especially when it comes to you, Kuniko!

68
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,090
That's right. You're going independent

69
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,890
and opening a designer's office of your own, aren't you?

70
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,790
Well, sort of.

71
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,590
That's really something.

72
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,990
I'm the only one who's no more than just a housewife.

73
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,590
Oh, come on.

74
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,090
You went ahead before us and got a happily married life!

75
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,790
That's true! Look at you, so happy and plump.

76
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,590
Oh, cut it out.

77
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,290
You know I'm not happy about being plump.

78
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,090
The train headed for Dolphin Land will be arriving soon.

79
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,690
-Please stand away from the door. -Oh, here it comes.

80
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,090
Off we go to where the fourth beauty awaits us!

81
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,790
Here we go! The monorail will get us there in no time!

82
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:45,390
"Dolphin Land Station"

83
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,590
That's the Dolphin Land Hotel.

84
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,590
They just renovated and newly opened last month.

85
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,690
Talk about a classical setting.

86
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,190
This is called the retro floor.

87
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,090
Retro floor?

88
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,790
The original model of this hotel

89
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,290
is a long established famous Japanese inn called Iruka-Tei (Dolphin Inn).

90
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,890
Come, Naomi's room is over this side.

91
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,490
Sure thing!

92
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:24,190
Hey, Kuniko. What is Naomi's room number?

93
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,690
Room 503.

94
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,190
Room 503...

95
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,490
It's here.

96
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,190
We made it. It's 2pm sharp.

97
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,590
Huh? Don't tell me that Naomi's sleeping,

98
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,090
despite telling us to rush over?

99
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,990
Goodness.

100
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,990
What a girl.

101
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,690
Naomi?

102
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,590
Now, what do we do?

103
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,690
Huh? The door isn't locked.

104
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,490
Let's just go inside.

105
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,690
Naomi?

106
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,290
We're coming in.

107
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,990
Don't! You don't know them well enough yet!

108
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,790
Hey, what is this?

109
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,690
What's wrong?

110
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,290
Naomi?

111
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,390
It can't be...

112
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,790
Please calm down.

113
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,290
Don't touch anything in this room.

114
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,390
I said don't touch anything!

115
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,090
It seems to have switched off automatically.

116
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,790
This TV is coin operated.

117
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,090
Ran, get the police.

118
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,390
Okay!

119
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:45,890
"Off-limits"

120
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,090
What happened?

121
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,090
So, the body was found by the three of you.

122
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,790
And like always, the one who coincidentally happened to be here,

123
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,290
Mr. Mouri?

124
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,290
Yes, sir.

125
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,590
I'll have to interrogate you, too.

126
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,690
Can you wait a while?

127
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,090
I'll act as their bodyguard, then!

128
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,390
There is no need for you to do that.

129
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,090
Hey, Officer Chiba!

130
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,090
Yes!

131
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,190
Take care of the girls, will you?

132
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,390
Yes, sir!

133
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,390
Please come this way.

134
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,190
Hey, Mr. Mouri!

135
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,590
Yes, sir!

136
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,590
How is it, Officer Takagi?

137
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,490
Oh, inspector.

138
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,690
The victim is Ms. Naomi Fujimura, age 27.

139
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,790
She worked abroad as a designer for children's clothes.

140
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,290
Inspector!

141
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,990
I found this in the pocket of the skirt of the victim.

142
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,990
It's a tear gas spray used to war away sexual harrassers.

143
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,990
What? Tear gas spray?

144
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,390
Maybe she was a very cautious person

145
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,790
because she had been living in the States for some time?

146
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,390
It is strange.

147
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:02,890
What a place full of things from olden times.

148
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,590
This is called a retro room.

149
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,790
It is a replica of a guest room

150
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,290
of an old established renown Japanese inn.

151
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,290
That's why the TV is coin operated.

152
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,790
This is the type that you can watch it for an hour

153
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,990
by inserting 100 yen coin.

154
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:23,190
So, the TV switched off as soon as you all entered the room?

155
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,090
Yes, at about 2 pm.

156
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,990
According to the operation manual on top of the TV,

157
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,790
only one 100 yen coin can be inserted at a time.

158
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:37,190
In other words, the TV was turned on about an hour ago.

159
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,290
What is the estimated time of death?

160
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,790
From between 12 pm to 1 pm.

161
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,790
So, she was attacked as soon as the TV was switched on.

162
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,890
Hey. This candy sure is a rare one, isn't it?

163
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,990
I've never seen candies like these!

164
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,090
Not you again!

165
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,190
Soda candy, stringed candy balls,

166
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,290
squid candy and sauce crackers.

167
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,790
All candies that I used to know when I was a child.

168
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:08,390
These candies come with this room as snacks to have tea with.

169
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,890
They probably scattered when the killer and the victim

170
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,990
struggled with each other.

171
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,690
Huh? There's ice cream.

172
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,290
It's already melted, though.

173
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,390
Ice cream?

174
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,890
She was probably attacked

175
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:26,490
while she was eating ice cream and watching TV.

176
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,590
Will somebody check if there is ice cream in the freezer?

177
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,690
Yes, sir.

178
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,590
Inspector, there are a few bars inside.

179
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,790
These bars of ice cream are also very nostalgic.

180
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,590
It seems exactly as you say, Mr. Mouri.

181
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,990
No, this ice cream bar is not of the olden days.

182
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,090
Did the victim buy it?

183
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,290
Or maybe...

184
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,890
What's this? It's wet.

185
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,190
It seems slightly wet here.

186
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,590
Wet?

187
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,290
Maybe the water from a vase spilled or something.

188
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,390
You delivered the blouse that had been cleaned

189
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,590
a little before 1 pm?

190
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,490
Yes.

191
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:19,290
But since the "Do not disturb" sign was on the door,

192
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,990
so I didn't go inside.

193
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,490
Was the door locked at that time?

194
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,190
You again!

195
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,590
Now, now.

196
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,390
So, was it locked?

197
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,490
I didn't touch the door knob,

198
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,890
so I don't know.

199
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,190
Inspector.

200
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,890
The victim's cell phone was found under the table.

201
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:47,190
Oh, right. Will you check the outgoing calls?

202
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,690
Okay.

203
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,390
This is...

204
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,190
Please take a look, Inspector.

205
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,390
"November 19th: 1:08 pm, Kuniko Yamamoto"

206
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,290
Kuniko Yamamoto?

207
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,790
She's one of the three girls.

208
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:03,190
She called the victim at 1:08 pm,

209
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,090
that's just before she was killed.

210
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:09,290
Just after Ms. Yamamoto got the call,

211
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,390
we ran into them.

212
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,490
Oh, I see.

213
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,590
Yes, it was definitely Naomi

214
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,490
telling us to hurry over to her place.

215
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,690
It shows 1:08 pm.

216
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,290
True.

217
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,490
Where were you then?

218
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:31,290
At the monorail station, waiting for the train.

219
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,790
We were together with each other from 1pm.

220
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:38,190
Kanami came 10 minutes late, though.

221
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:43,590
After that, we got on the 1:20 monorail.

222
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:47,890
We arrived at the hotel at about 1:50 pm.

223
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,790
We got to Naomi's room at 2 pm sharp.

224
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:57,290
In other words, the girls have an alibi.

225
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,690
One last thing.

226
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,090
Would you please return to the scene of the crime again

227
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,790
and explain the circumstances of when you discovered the corpse?

228
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,890
Yes.

229
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,190
No, this is a well calculated homicide.

230
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,590
If my deduction is correct, she is the killer.

231
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,590
But I don't have evidence.

232
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,590
What was that?

233
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,990
That sound of something rubbing against something

234
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,290
I see.

235
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:29,590
The killer still has the evidence.

236
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,890
She is the killer after all!

237
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,380
Thank you, everyone. You can all go for today.

238
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,280
Inspector, I guess I'll go with the girls and...

239
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,080
Dad?

240
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,880
On second thought, maybe not just yet.

241
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,680
Inspector, this is a carefully schemed case of homicide.

242
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,680
-What was that? -What?

243
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:10,080
Moreover, the killer is right here, among the three girls.

244
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,080
What?

245
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,780
It can't be!

246
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,380
The killer is among us?

247
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,480
What a thing to say.

248
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,680
First is the tear gas spray that Ms. Fujimura had with her.

249
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,080
She had it in her pocket, yet didn't use it.

250
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,080
It was probably because the the killer was someone she knew.

251
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,180
Second is the room key.

252
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,280
The one that is on the table.

253
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,580
Let's say that the killer were a robber,

254
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,580
wouldn't it only be natural that the killer would lock the door

255
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,280
when fleeing to buy time to delay discovery of the corpse?

256
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,480
True...

257
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,980
But all the girls have an alibi after 1 pm, you know?

258
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:57,380
The actual time of death is way earlier than 1 pm.

259
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,980
Probably at around 12:20 or so.

260
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,580
How do you explain the TV, then?

261
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,180
It switched off at a little after 2 pm,

262
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,180
which means the coin was inserted a little after 1 pm.

263
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,980
One doesn't have to be in this room to insert the coin.

264
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,580
Look, the candies that are scattered around the room are used.

265
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,580
Candies?

266
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,480
Just how do you do that?

267
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,580
Well, I'll explain that right now.

268
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,780
Conan!

269
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,480
Yes!

270
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,580
You use this ice cream bar

271
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,680
and candy ball with a string attached.

272
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,680
What? With things like that?

273
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,580
Well, watch!

274
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,080
First, you hook the string of the candy ball

275
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,880
to the metal piece by the coin insert slot.

276
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,480
As for the bar of ice cream...

277
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,680
Place it on the channel of the TV and on the cabinet

278
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,380
to serve as a bridge.

279
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,580
Then, one end of the string of the candy ball

280
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,080
is held down by a packaged bar of ice cream.

281
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,480
Do you have a 100 yen coin, Ran?

282
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,980
What? Let's see...

283
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,880
-Here you go. -Can you put it by the coin slot?

284
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,180
Okay.

285
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,780
The coin is caught by the string and cannot be inserted.

286
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,580
After setting all this up, the killer left the room.

287
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,580
As time passes, the ice cream will melt.

288
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,080
If the ice cream melts,

289
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,980
the support is lost and the string drops to the floor.

290
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,680
It's like that.

291
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,580
I see.

292
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,480
Candies were scattered around the TV set

293
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,980
was to hide the trick.

294
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,080
It seems so.

295
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,680
The channel changer and the top of the cabinet were wet

296
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,680
because of the ice cream bar that was left there.

297
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,880
Moreover,

298
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,580
that ice cream bar is one that has recently come on the market,

299
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,980
so it's not something that was left here in the room to begin with.

300
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,980
Naomi could've bought it herself!

301
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:01,680
The killer didn't lock the door to carry out the trick, you know.

302
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,380
Just what do you mean?

303
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,480
Because if she locked the door,

304
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,480
even if she were to return here with her friends,

305
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,880
she wouldn't be able to show them the instant the TV switches off.

306
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,280
I see!

307
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
It would be meaningless

308
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,180
unless she showed somebody the TV switching off.

309
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,180
Which means that the sign on the door knob was...

310
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,280
The killer probably hung it on the door knob.

311
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,580
Be it only for an hour and a half,

312
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,980
she had to leave the room

313
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,180
with the corpse inside without locking the door.

314
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,880
Because if someone enters the room,

315
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,980
everything goes down the drain.

316
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,280
Wait a minute!

317
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,180
I got a call from Naomi at 1:08 pm, remember?

318
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,380
That's right!

319
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,580
If Naomi were killed one hour before,

320
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,780
she wouldn't be able to make the call, would she?

321
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,980
That's right, Mr Mouri.

322
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,480
Their outgoing and incoming calls all matched up, too.

323
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,980
The killer called

324
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,580
by using the victim's cell phone.

325
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,280
What?

326
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,280
But Kuniko was talking to Naomi and...

327
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,280
Don't tell me that...

328
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,080
That's right. She couldn't have possibly talked to the victim.

329
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,180
In other words, the killer is you,

330
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:16,180
Ms. Kuniko Yamamoto!

331
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,780
Kuniko.

332
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,280
No way!

333
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,380
After committing the murder,

334
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,580
you took Ms. Fujimura's cell phone

335
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:30,080
and went back to the monorail station to join Kaori.

336
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,880
At around 1 pm,

337
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:38,080
you then called your own cell phone from Ms. Fujimura's cell phone

338
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,480
and pretended talking to her.

339
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,180
All you had to do left

340
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,680
was to return the cell phone to the room

341
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,380
during the commotion of the body being found.

342
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,780
Do you have evidence?

343
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,780
You've got the evidence, don't you?

344
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,780
What?

345
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,880
The vinyl bag in your pocket.

346
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,180
What about it?

347
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,280
You put Ms. Fujimura's cellular in there

348
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,880
and took it out, didn't you?

349
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,580
Is that true?

350
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,780
Hey!

351
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,080
Yes, sir!

352
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,080
Please let me check your pocket.

353
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,380
Hey!

354
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,780
It's here.

355
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,780
Hold it up to the light and look at it.

356
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,180
Yes, sir.

357
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,280
There are several fingerprints...

358
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,880
There is a place where the fingerprints are bunched up vertically.

359
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,480
Ms. Yamamoto, when I saw your cellular,

360
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,680
I noticed something interesting.

361
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:50,780
020582805.

362
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,980
When you match that up with the number keys of the cell phone,

363
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,280
only the keys of the center vertical row are used.

364
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,580
The fingerprints are bunched up vertically

365
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,580
because you pushed the number over the vinyl bag.

366
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,980
What?

367
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,180
Hey! Bring the victim's cellular phone.

368
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,780
Yes, sir.

369
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,680
It's only natural that the vinyl bag that was in my pocket

370
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,380
has my fingerprints on it!

371
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,280
This is the victim's cell phone.

372
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,980
It matches up perfectly!

373
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,880
I couldn't...

374
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,880
forgive Naomi.

375
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,380
Kuniko?

376
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,680
Why, Kuniko?

377
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,980
During our university graduation,

378
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,780
the valedictorian was to be recommended

379
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,880
to a brand name merchandise abroad.

380
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,580
Naomi who attained that glory

381
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,780
succeeded as a children's clothes designer.

382
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,680
But the fact was, I was the one

383
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,580
who was supposed to get that recommendation!

384
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,280
Naomi had the nerve to use her feminine wiles on the Professor!

385
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,980
I didn't know about it until the Professor slipped his tongue

386
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,980
and told me about it at a bar we went to after the class reunion.

387
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,780
But weren't you going to go independent

388
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,380
and open your own office, too?

389
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,980
I lied.

390
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,280
The truth is, I was laid off.

391
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,480
Just because of one little first time mistake!

392
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,080
Laid off?

393
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,080
I was so vexed!

394
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,780
Thinking why I had to go through all this.

395
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,980
I was made to go through all this

396
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,380
just because of Naomi!

397
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,180
Naomi took my happiness away from me!

398
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,980
That's why I...

399
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,880
How lucky that there was a night show!

400
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,380
Yes!

401
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,880
And this is the best seat, too.

402
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,280
Well, I guess we were lucky.

403
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,380
Kids stuff...

404
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,280
Okay, now the dolphins will throw balls

405
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,380
at the guests that they take a liking to.

406
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,580
Please catch the ball for them!

407
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,780
That hurts!

408
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:00,380
You sure are popular, Pops.

409
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,120
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,120
"High tide, low tide"
