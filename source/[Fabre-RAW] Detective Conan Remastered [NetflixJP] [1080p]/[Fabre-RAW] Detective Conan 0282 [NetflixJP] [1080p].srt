1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:03,470
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,370
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,170
In a beautiful garden, a mysterious case occurs.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,670
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,770
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,270
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,310
Thank you for the treat.

8
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,410
This is such a great garden that's true to your title

9
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,410
as the president of the Kiyama Furniture Company.

10
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,210
What a nice house you have!

11
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,610
This is the first time

12
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,410
I've seen a garden with a waterfall like this!

13
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,110
This garden somehow makes me feel at peace.

14
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,910
Glad to hear that you like my garden.

15
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,810
I'm glad I brought you up here too.

16
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,010
I think it's about time to begin.

17
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,310
Eh? To begin what?

18
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,910
You'll see.

19
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,610
Oh, Conan, look over there!

20
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,910
Water is flowing over the basin of the waterfall!

21
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,710
Oh, yeah!

22
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,210
The water is filling the garden!

23
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,910
What's that?

24
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,110
Surprised, eh?

25
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,510
At 8 a.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. three times a day,

26
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:09,110
the water flows into the garden.

27
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,110
But in doing so, won't the sand pattern disappear?

28
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,710
Water is poured in slowly so that the pattern is not lost,

29
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,510
then the water is drained in 30 minutes.

30
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,210
The former president made this device.

31
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,010
It's quite highly reputed.

32
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,010
Well, if you'll excuse me for a moment, I'd like to get back to work.

33
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,710
But make yourselves at home. See you at dinner.

34
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,310
And don't worry about your car.

35
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,710
I'll get my secretary to pick it up tomorrow.

36
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,610
Thank so much for everything.

37
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,610
I'm sure you'd have done the same for me if I were in your shoes.

38
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,410
Okay then. I'll leave them to you, Ayaka.

39
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,510
Very well, President.

40
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,110
Boy oh boy, what a truly superb view!

41
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,710
It's really awesome.

42
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,510
What carefree jokers they are!

43
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,310
Don't they realize how costly it is to maintain it?

44
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,510
The garden Kiyama made is really nothing but a big nuisance for me!

45
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,810
Look, Conan!

46
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:11,910
Oh, my, we can see clearly through the circles of white sand!

47
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,410
It's beautiful, Ran!

48
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,410
I'll bet it's especially romantic at night

49
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,210
when the moon is reflected on the water.

50
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,310
Yes, indeed.

51
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:25,110
We even have guests who come here every full moon.

52
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,510
How wonderful to drink cold sake

53
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,410
while viewing a full moon rising from behind Mt. Fuji.

54
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,910
It's out of this world.

55
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,810
Hey, what's that?

56
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,910
Over there. Something's by the pillar.

57
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,410
Oh, that! It's a catching pole.

58
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,610
Catching pole?

59
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:46,910
Yes.

60
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,610
When someone drops something on the white sand of the yard,

61
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,710
we lengthen this pole and pick it up like this.

62
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,010
We can't step on the wave pattern of the white sand.

63
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,610
I see. It's well thought out.

64
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,110
Well, since Mr. Majima became president,

65
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,110
the gardener comes only once a month, so...

66
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,110
Pretty mind racking, isn't it?

67
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,910
Oh, the water's begun to drain.

68
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,210
Yeah, really.

69
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,610
It's amazing how well this works.

70
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,410
"Mystery of the Japanese Water Flowing Rock Garden"

71
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,710
"(Part 1)"

72
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,510
If you like, shall we go to the saloon

73
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,310
where aperitif will be served.

74
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,510
Oh yeah, here we go!

75
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:55,210
You don't have money? Give me a break!

76
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,110
You still owe me 5 million yen,

77
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,010
no, 7 million yet including interest!

78
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,610
Mr. Majima?

79
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,810
Pay back the money in full by the end of this month!

80
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,610
Otherwise, you'll be fired! You better dig in!

81
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,710
Please wait! President!

82
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,310
This western style house is marvelous too.

83
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,110
Yes. It's truly splendid.

84
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,810
Please come on in.

85
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,910
Oh, well well.

86
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,510
Please come this way.

87
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,410
Oh, thank you, thank you.

88
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,810
It's the man we saw just a while ago.

89
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,010
Yeah.

90
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,310
Can I get you something to drink, sir?

91
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,210
Sure, I'll take a beer.

92
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,060
I'll be right back

93
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,260
Hey, Dad! It's too early to be drinking yet!

94
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,060
Why not?

95
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,860
Ayaka.

96
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,860
Who're these people?

97
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,260
They are Mr. Majima's guests.

98
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,060
His guests?

99
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,560
I don't know if we can be called guest, because you see,

100
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,860
we actually ran out of gas on Sanbonzaka.

101
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,260
Then, President Majima, who happened to pass by,

102
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,860
looked in on us.

103
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:32,360
Moreover, he kindly invited us for dinner this evening.

104
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,860
The president is a nice friendly person, isn't he?

105
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,660
Heck. He always puts on a friendly face in public.

106
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,460
Can I ask you something?

107
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,960
Is this supposed to be a private gathering

108
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,160
to commemorate the opening day of Kiyama Furniture's first store?

109
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,260
All is well, Mr. Endo.

110
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,560
Mr. Majima invited them.

111
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,760
And besides, the more the merrier for dinner, right?

112
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,860
I guess so, but...

113
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,760
If you will excuse me.

114
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,060
Well, I'd like to introduce everyone.

115
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,860
This is the secretary to the president, Mr. Masayuki Hashimoto.

116
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,560
Nice to meet you.

117
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,860
And this is the president of the Kiyama Interior Company,

118
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,460
one of our affiliated companies, Mr. Endo.

119
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,860
Mr. Endo has taken part

120
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,360
in the National Sports Festival as an archer.

121
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,560
That's something!

122
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,160
But it was long time ago.

123
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,260
Now, it's a different story.

124
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,160
And I'm Tomonori Kiyama, a freelance writer.

125
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,060
Are you Mr. Kiyama, the author of "Wandering Through Africa"?

126
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,160
-Yes, I am. -Wow! I thought so!

127
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,310
Do you know him?

128
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,410
Yeah!

129
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,710
He is a travelogue writer who travels to many countries.

130
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,310
I've read your "Wandering Through Africa".

131
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,310
Oh, thank you.

132
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,610
How did you like it?

133
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,810
Oh. I was deeply moved!

134
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,110
Could I have your autograph, please?

135
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,010
Sure, my pleasure.

136
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,110
I tell you what.

137
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,010
I'll be holding a photo exhibition.

138
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,310
So if it's okay with you, please come.

139
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,310
Wow! Thank you, are you sure it's okay?

140
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,710
Thank you so much.

141
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,110
I'll sign my autograph now.

142
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,810
What an old-fashioned fountain pen you have.

143
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,810
This is the only thing I have to remember my father by.

144
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,610
Although it's no great fountain pen,

145
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,310
I just couldn't bear getting rid of it.

146
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,410
So, I always keep it on me.

147
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,910
Okay, here you are.

148
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,010
Thank you very much!

149
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,310
Please come with your friends.

150
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,910
Yes, I definitely will!

151
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,010
However, I didn't know you were related

152
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,310
to the family of Kiyama Furniture.

153
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,610
My father built up the company in the course of his lifetime.

154
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:58,910
After his death, Mr. Majima succeeded my father as president.

155
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,410
Oh, have you already seen the Rock Garden?

156
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,010
Yes, we have! Patterns on the white sand were so beautiful!

157
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,910
Exactly! That waterfall and white sand!

158
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,810
The garden you saw was what my father kept working on to complete,

159
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,210
whenever he had time to spare from his busy schedule,

160
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,410
putting his heart and soul into it.

161
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,310
Hey, how did your father die?

162
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,510
Conan. How rude.

163
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,210
No. It's okay.

164
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,110
He died in a traffic accident last year.

165
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,210
I see.

166
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,510
You never know what destiny lies ahead.

167
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,910
There's a scenic site with fantastic night view.

168
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,910
So, I suggest you go there later.

169
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,510
It's very beautiful.

170
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,810
All of you really must see it.

171
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,810
Shall we go up there, Conan?

172
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,810
I think I'll pass.

173
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,710
I'd rather stay here and enjoy a leisurely drink.

174
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,810
Come off it, Dad.

175
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,910
You must see it, too! It's well worth looking at!

176
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,010
Unlike Tokyo, the stars seem so close

177
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,910
that it looks like they're going to shower down on you!

178
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,210
Stars...

179
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,910
Thank you for waiting.

180
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,510
Here comes the beer!

181
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,410
Thank you very much.

182
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,910
If you like, we have drinks other than beer too.

183
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,810
I'll bring you another cup.

184
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,710
Thanks! Now, I can drink my heart out.

185
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,510
Which one should I drink?

186
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,710
Hey! Stop it, Dad.

187
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,510
Hey, hey! Cut it out! Don't spill it!

188
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,110
What a waste!

189
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,110
Oh man, talk about addicted to liquor.

190
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,410
Here, have another one.

191
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,410
Oh, thank you.

192
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,710
Well, well, I've had enough.

193
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,410
Excuse me.

194
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,410
Mr. Majima.

195
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,210
Sorry, I haven't been around you to see you lately.

196
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:20,410
I came to tell you that I'm going to holding an exhibition.

197
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,610
If you like, please come by and look at my photos.

198
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,210
A photo exhibition.

199
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,510
Well, Tomonori, you seem to really be working at it.

200
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,610
Okay, I'll drop by.

201
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,310
President.

202
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,910
This is last month's sales report.

203
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,110
I hope that the figures are accurate at least,

204
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,410
since this is your last time.

205
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,810
-Now, then... -Wait!

206
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,910
Dinner is ready, Sir.

207
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,710
Will you all please come this way to the banquet hall?

208
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:12,210
Finally! Dinner party!

209
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,300
Well, I'd like to propose a toast 

210
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,300
for Kiyama Furniture's future prosperity!

211
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,300
Cheers!

212
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,800
This is the best meat I've ever tasted!

213
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,200
Yeah, it's so tender.

214
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,300
Care for a drink?

215
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,500
Oh, well, thank you.

216
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,700
You really do like that, don't you? I tell you.

217
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,700
I really appreciate having the opportunity

218
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,100
to meet new friends like you.

219
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,900
So, if you like it, I'll sell it cheap to you.

220
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,100
Really?

221
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,500
Dad!

222
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,800
You've got to be joking.

223
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,400
Hey, listen, Dad!

224
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,400
Come on.

225
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,600
So, please talk this over with your father before you decide

226
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
whether you want to buy it or not.

227
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
If you'll excuse me, I've got to get going

228
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,600
since I still have work left to do.

229
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,300
I guess I'll be going too.

230
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,600
I have a video that I want to watch,

231
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,700
so I hope you don't mind going to see the night view after I'm done.

232
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,700
Sure, no problem.

233
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,400
Well, I'll come and pick you up around 11:15.

234
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,600
So, please wait in your room.

235
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,300
Yes. I got it.

236
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,500
Wonder what kind of video it is?

237
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,700
It's a documentary film that he wanted to watch about

238
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,200
an adventurer named Hiroyuki Sekiguchi.

239
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,700
I happened to find the video

240
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,000
so I brought it with me to show it to him.

241
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,600
I see.

242
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,800
Documentary film about an adventurer, my foot.

243
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,700
He's so absorbed in watching videos like that,

244
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,000
that's why the company's taken over by Majima.

245
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,500
What a thing to say, Mr. Hashimoto!

246
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,100
Mr. Majima is not that kind of person.

247
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,300
Oh, what's come over you, Mr. Endo?

248
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,500
How strange for you to be taking sides with Majima.

249
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,700
Making remarks like that won't help at this point already.

250
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,800
I hear you'll be discharged next month,

251
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,100
due to the firm's poor performance,

252
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,100
which you're held responsible for.

253
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,400
But, the debts of Kiyama Interior

254
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
are essentially the debts of Kiyama Furniture.

255
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,700
The parent company passed the buck to your company.

256
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,800
I also hear that you are just taking out your misery on others,

257
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,900
shouting furiously "Why should I be fired for that?"

258
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,200
So, everyone's worried saying,

259
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,200
"It comes as no surprise if he killed Majima."

260
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,600
Hey, Mr. Hashimoto! You're really starting to get on my nerves!

261
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,300
So, please excuse me too

262
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,300
because I have some work to do at my office.

263
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,300
Oh, by the way, you had better forget about

264
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,400
what you mentioned a little while ago.

265
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,000
What I mentioned a little while ago?

266
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,800
You mentioned the desk.

267
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,700
Listen. At first, he approaches you looking very friendly.

268
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,000
But once he gets you, you can't get rid of him.

269
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,700
That's his way, don't get involved with him!

270
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,200
He's bad news.

271
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,000
Mr. Hashimoto!

272
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:40,200
Dad, let's go back to our room too.

273
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,100
Come on. It wouldn't hurt to drink a little more.

274
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,900
You know, our life could come to an end tomorrow.

275
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,900
So, drink when you can.

276
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,200
Now you're talking.

277
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,700
Hey, Dad!

278
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,300
Oh, it's this late already.

279
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,600
Mr. Mouri, I think we have to call it a night.

280
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,500
Dad, wake up.

281
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,900
What?

282
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,900
Let's get back to our room.

283
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,100
Hey, wait! There's still a bottle of beer to drink!

284
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,300
Drink, drink while you can!

285
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,600
Is Mr. Mouri all right?

286
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,600
I'm really sorry for all the fuss.

287
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,800
I can still drink!

288
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,700
Here you are. This is medicine for hangover.

289
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,200
Thank you.

290
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,000
I'll be here if you need any assistance.

291
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,600
Just call me when necessary.

292
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,100
Okay.

293
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,700
Good night.

294
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,500
This will be fine. I'm sorry for you father.

295
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,800
I feel bad that I pushed him to drink more.

296
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,900
Don't worry. This happens all the time.

297
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,900
Sorry for the trouble. Thank you too.

298
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,000
Good night.

299
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,900
Yeah, good night.

300
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,000
Yes. I'll open the door now.

301
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,400
Sorry to keep you waiting.

302
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,500
No, not at all.

303
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,900
Did you enjoy the video?

304
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,400
Yes, very much.

305
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,100
It was a superb documentary with great power.

306
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,800
We're just taking a run up to Mt. Prospect.

307
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,400
Don't be long.

308
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,800
It's so beautiful, like a dream.

309
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,800
Pop should have come here too.

310
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,700
I recall the days when I was a child,

311
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,800
my father and I used to come here.

312
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,100
My father also liked this night view.

313
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,000
We're back now!

314
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,300
Welcome back!

315
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,400
How was the night scene?

316
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,900
It was so beautiful that I was impressed.

317
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,500
Right, Conan?

318
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,200
That's great.

319
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,100
So, Ayaka, good night.

320
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,600
Good night!

321
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,200
Good night.

322
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,800
A picture?

323
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,300
Thank you very much.

324
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm glad that you enjoyed it.

325
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,700
So, see you tomorrow.

326
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,100
Good night!

327
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,000
This voice?

328
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,200
What is it?

329
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,600
Ayaka! What's wrong?

330
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,600
That!

331
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,800
What happened?

332
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,600
Ma... President Majima!

333
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,000
What? What was that scream about?

334
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
Mr. Majima!

335
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,000
Ran! Call the police now!

336
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,100
Yes!

337
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,300
What's the trouble?

338
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,700
President!

339
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,800
You! Keep out! This is a homicide!

340
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,900
Don't enter the garden! We've got to preserve the crime scene!

341
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,900
What's with you?

342
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,100
Pushing your weight around and giving out orders.

343
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,400
I'm Kogoro Mouri, a private detective.

344
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,800
You're Kogoro Mouri, that renowned detective.

345
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,400
You got it.

346
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,500
Don't you think that there's something strange

347
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,100
about the President's corpse?

348
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,100
Strange? What's strange?

349
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,300
Around the body...

350
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,500
There are no footsteps at all!

351
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,600
True.

352
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,000
So, how did the murderer carry Mr. Majima up there?

353
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,420
"Draining of the water"

354
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,120
