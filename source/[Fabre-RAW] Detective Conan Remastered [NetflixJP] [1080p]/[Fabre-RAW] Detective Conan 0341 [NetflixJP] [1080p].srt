1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,140
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,140
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,840
The true killer is found together with a secret cassette tape.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,740
A message that sways Ai's heart.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,340
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,260
"The Secret Hidden in the Toilet (Part 2)"

9
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,260
The burglary that happened after my older sister visited here

10
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,760
was most likely done by those people.

11
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,360
Yeah.

12
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,560
They probably guessed that she may have hidden something here

13
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,560
and came to look for it.

14
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,460
There were traces of them having set up

15
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,160
wiretaps in the toilet too.

16
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,160
It's most likely that they couldn't find it

17
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,760
when they broke in here the first time,

18
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,060
and so they set up a wiretap.

19
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,360
But after hearing that the people here

20
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,160
knew nothing of something being hidden,

21
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,160
they probably broke in here a second time

22
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,360
to remove the wiretap.

23
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,660
But I think it has nothing to do with this case.

24
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,160
President Dejima may be your father's friend

25
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,160
and your father may have been a member of the Black Organization,

26
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,560
but they haven't met for 30 years.

27
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,660
What if it's me that they're after?

28
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,660
They killed my father's friend

29
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,460
to mentally corner me.

30
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,460
Then what?

31
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,460
Don't be silly!

32
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,960
How could they ever find out something like that?

33
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,060
I could feel it.

34
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,860
The day when we went to that department store

35
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,560
in Haido-cho,

36
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,260
I could feel that callous glare on me

37
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,660
as I went unconscious.

38
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,060
What?

39
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,960
Then why did you come here?

40
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,460
Why did you do this if you knew you'd be in danger?

41
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,160
I wanted to know.

42
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,060
Is that reason good enough?

43
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,760
I wanted to know whether my parents

44
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,060
were really the kind of people the organization rumored them to be.

45
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,160
After meeting your cheerful mother,

46
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,860
I had this urge of wanting to do so.

47
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,760
But leaving aside my mad scientist father,

48
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,060
it seems that my mother was reticent, somber,

49
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,060
and hard to understand as rumor has it.

50
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,660
Don't be silly.

51
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,360
It's just rumor, isn't it?

52
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,160
Don't make conclusions without seeing it for yourself.

53
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,660
Do you know

54
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,660
what my mother was referred to as in the organization?

55
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,860
Hell Angel.

56
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,160
An angel who has fallen to hell.

57
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,160
Well, now I'm totally uninterested in her

58
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,760
and feel sort of relieved.

59
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,760
Now that I've finished all I have to do here,

60
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,460
let's leave the homicide case to the police

61
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,660
and get out of here quickly.

62
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,960
I'm not even sure if we have any place

63
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,660
to run to at this point though.

64
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,460
But unless we find what your older sister had hidden...

65
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,560
He made a deduction a while ago regarding the wiretap.

66
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,560
It could be that after hearing

67
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,960
the conversation of the employees here,

68
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,060
they specified the place the object was hidden,

69
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,960
broke in here a second time,

70
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,960
found what they were looking for and retrieved the wiretap

71
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,360
while they were at it too.

72
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,860
Right?

73
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,860
That's why there's no reason we should stay here any longer.

74
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,360
So you were burglarized,

75
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,960
but nothing was stolen?

76
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
No.

77
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,460
"Isamu Natsuhori (35)" -But it seemed that the president

78
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,160
"Designer" -thought that his design was stolen.

79
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,260
"Tetsuo Imai (52)" -He insisted someone

80
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,160
"Designer" -had secretly taken a picture of his design.

81
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,060
The president was always nervous about things like that.

82
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,460
He would lose his temper every time he saw

83
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,160
a design that was similar to his.

84
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,460
He went to shout his mouth off this morning too.

85
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,660
This morning?

86
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,660
"Ukihiko Zaitsu (41)" -Yes.

87
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,360
"Designer" -To another design office.

88
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,660
He went to tell them off for stealing his design,

89
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,160
and he accused them of the burglary some time ago.

90
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,060
Don't tell me that...

91
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,360
Yes, it's possible that when he went to that design studio,

92
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,060
someone managed to get him in contact with the poison.

93
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,260
Well, I don't blame the president for being angry though.

94
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,560
If his design was copied and news began spreading,

95
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,760
people would get bored and it'd be disposed of in no time.

96
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,860
Disposed of?

97
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,260
Oh, yes. A strange thing happened after the burglary.

98
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,960
A strange thing?

99
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,760
A pen that was lost a long time ago

100
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,160
suddenly appeared again.

101
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,560
Right, right!

102
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,660
Together with my ruler.

103
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,960
So it was not stolen, and it suddenly reappeared?

104
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,360
Yes. I just found it on the shoe cabinet near the front door.

105
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,660
But wasn't that before the burglary?

106
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,760
What?

107
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,360
Was it?

108
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,660
But what was even stranger after that was the president.

109
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,760
Yeah. Now that you mentioned it,

110
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,060
it started around that time, didn't it?

111
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,560
He kept going around saying we should save water.

112
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,060
He started nagging us to save water.

113
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,260
So, we had to stop taking showers during work.

114
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,460
He wasn't the type to be worried about something like that.

115
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,260
And yet...

116
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,860
I see.

117
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,060
So that's what it was.

118
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,360
Could you take us to the design office then?

119
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,060
Yes, sir.

120
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,860
Something isn't right after all.

121
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,460
This case has nothing to do with the men in black.

122
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,660
The killer is probably that man.

123
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,360
He used the toilet to his advantage

124
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,860
to kill President Dejima.

125
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,860
And why should we leave when the treasure

126
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,360
is right before our eyes?

127
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,760
Then...

128
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:10,660
Yeah, it should still be in that toilet.

129
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,860
The thing that your sister hid in there.

130
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,460
Inspector! Let's go to the design office.

131
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,060
Yeah.

132
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,060
Maybe we can find out

133
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,560
how the poison was put on President Dejima

134
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,060
without being noticed by anybody.

135
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,860
No, you'll find nothing.

136
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,260
Well, you see...

137
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,560
Even if there were something with poison on it,

138
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,760
wouldn't he have touched something as soon as he came back here?

139
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,860
For example, the doorknob or the back of the chair.

140
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,560
But the poison was detected only on the president's left hand,

141
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,360
the right side of his slacks, the belt holes of his belt,

142
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,860
the handkerchief that he had

143
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,760
and the wrapper of the hamburger

144
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,060
that he took a bite of just before he collapsed.

145
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,460
Besides, the poison was of a very small amount.

146
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,860
He must've touched the poison beforehand

147
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,160
for it to rub off on those spots.

148
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,360
You can already make it out, can't you?

149
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,360
Where did the poison got onto the president's hand?

150
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,460
The place where you loosen your belt,

151
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,560
pull your slacks up and down,

152
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,260
and the place where you use a handkerchief.

153
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,160
Don't tell me

154
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,960
it was in the toilet?

155
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,360
Yes. President Dejima came in contact

156
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,360
with the poison in the toilet and was killed

157
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,960
by one of the three employees over there!

158
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,640
But Dr. Agasa,

159
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,040
there was no poison reaction found in the toilet.

160
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,340
It's only natural that there was no reaction.

161
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:06,240
Because the thing with the poison smeared on it

162
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,040
was taken out of the toilet by President Dejima himself.

163
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,840
What?

164
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,440
It was taken out?

165
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,140
You know, the thing that you have to throw away

166
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,840
once it's been used up.

167
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,640
There wasn't any freshener inside.

168
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,040
And if he had changed the towel,

169
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,140
there would've been a cleaner one inside.

170
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,640
Then, all that's left would be changing the toilet paper...

171
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,240
Right! The cylinder!

172
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,640
It's the cylinder of the toilet paper!

173
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,340
If poison is smeared on it and it's left in place,

174
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,540
when the paper runs out and the roll has to be changed,

175
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,940
the person would take the empty roll

176
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,740
out of the toilet to dispose of it!

177
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,540
But if that was the case,

178
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,940
poison should be found on the toilet paper

179
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,940
that had been newly changed.

180
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,440
Usually, after you change the toilet paper roll,

181
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,740
you would use it, wouldn't you?

182
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,140
But in this case, the part with the poison on it

183
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:01,840
was torn off, used and flushed down the toilet.

184
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,840
-I see. -I see.

185
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,740
You see, are you convinced now?

186
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,240
And this is probably what President Dejima did in the toilet.

187
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,740
First, he realized that the roll was out of paper.

188
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,040
He touched the roll with poison on it with his right hand

189
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,140
and put it on the floor.

190
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,340
Then, he reached over for the new roll of toilet paper

191
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,540
on the shelf and replaced it.

192
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,740
After finished using the toilet paper,

193
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,540
he pulled his slacks up with his poisoned right hand,

194
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,340
fastened his belt,

195
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,140
and flushed the toilet with the lever

196
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,840
on the left side of the tank with his right hand.

197
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,340
After washing his hands,

198
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,640
if he wiped his hands with the handkerchief,

199
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,440
the poison would be wiped off.

200
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,740
And if he exited the toilet with the empty roll,

201
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,940
no poison would be left inside the toilet.

202
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,940
But the poison was detected on the victim's left hand.

203
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,740
He wasn't left-handed, so why would the poison

204
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,640
that was on the roll go on his left hand?

205
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,440
Come on, Inspector!

206
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,240
If you open the door with your right hand,

207
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,340
you would naturally hold the roll with your left hand, wouldn't you?

208
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,040
I see.

209
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,040
So, he brought the roll out of the toilet

210
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,440
and threw it into the wastebasket,

211
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,040
then grabbed the burger with his poisoned left hand,

212
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,640
ate it, and died.

213
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,140
Shall we test it out?

214
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,740
Let's go into the toilet.

215
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,640
Wait, Dr. Agasa!

216
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,440
The most important thing isn't solved yet!

217
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,340
Who of the three employees

218
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,940
was the one that set up this trick?

219
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,540
The most suspicious would be the one

220
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,540
who went into the toilet right before the president.

221
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,340
Hold it.

222
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,940
Isn't it strange?

223
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,340
It's true that the president

224
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,440
can be poisoned to death in the way he just explained,

225
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,940
but unless the president had the runs, went to the toilet

226
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,640
and used the toilet paper

227
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,540
while somebody went out to buy the hamburgers,

228
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,740
this crime wouldn't have occurred.

229
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,440
Besides, the president was the one who said

230
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,040
he wanted to eat hamburger.

231
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,240
It did fit in a bit too well.

232
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,640
That's why the killer carried out repeated simulations.

233
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,540
President Dejima had probably never dreamed

234
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,240
that the coffee which Mr. Imai served him everyday...

235
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,940
contained laxative.

236
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,240
-Laxative? -Laxative?

237
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,340
Then...

238
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,340
Mr. Imai's the one...

239
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,440
What?

240
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,640
He put more laxative in the coffee everyday

241
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,640
to get the president used to the taste,

242
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,040
and he calculated the timing of the president going to the toilet

243
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,640
with the amount of laxative he put in the coffee.

244
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:04,040
So, the president had frequent runs lately because...

245
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,640
Yes.

246
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,440
And since the president ordered hamburger,

247
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,940
he decided to kill him today.

248
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,140
Mr. Imai brought the cookie together with the coffee

249
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,040
so that it would urge the president to go to the toilet.

250
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,840
When people eat, a strong peristaltic movement takes place

251
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,340
from the transverse colon to the sigmoid colon.

252
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,940
In other words, when something goes into the stomach,

253
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,340
there will be a need for bowel movement.

254
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,940
Well, if President Dejima was taking laxatives

255
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,140
on a regular basis because of his hemorrhoids,

256
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,440
it wouldn't seem strange if laxatives were detected

257
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,540
in his body during the autopsy.

258
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,440
Even if laxatives were to be found in his coffee...

259
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,240
We would think that he had been drinking coffee that way.

260
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,140
So, there would be nothing suspicious.

261
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,640
Which means that Mr. Imai set the poison up

262
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,740
when he went to the toilet.

263
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,040
Hey! I went in before the president.

264
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,940
If I hadn't urinated but had gone to move my bowels instead,

265
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,640
are you saying I would've been dead?

266
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,340
No.

267
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,040
You always hold your drink in your left hand.

268
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,140
And if you had to frequently urinate,

269
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,740
it isn't hard to imagine that you'd do the same.

270
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,140
If you had to moved your bowels,

271
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,140
he would probably plan to give you a wet tissue or something,

272
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,440
telling you to wipe your hands before eating.

273
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,840
How can you tell if somebody's going to urinate

274
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,340
or move his bowels?

275
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,140
He couldn't have looked into the toilet.

276
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,240
From the sound of the toilet being flushed.

277
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,840
The sound of flushing?

278
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:37,140
President Dejima had nagged everyone about saving water.

279
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,840
You wouldn't use the lever that flushes a lot of water

280
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,140
when you urinate, would you?

281
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,040
He knew that Conan and Ai who went into the toilet after you

282
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,740
and were rushed out of there by the president

283
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,740
didn't touch the toilet paper roll smeared with poison.

284
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,040
Okay! All we need to find now

285
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,540
is the roll that President Dejima threw away somewhere!

286
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,340
-Yes, sir! -Wait.

287
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,640
He always throws it in here.

288
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,040
See? I found it.

289
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,140
Inspector!

290
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,540
Here, forensic officer!

291
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,840
If there's poison on this,

292
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,740
there should be a bag that was used to carry it here

293
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,140
and a container for the poison somewhere.

294
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,540
It's inside the triangular garbage disposer in the kitchen.

295
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,240
If it were me, I would go to the toilet and set the poison up,

296
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,240
then hide it in the kitchen while making coffee.

297
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,240
It's dirty and stinks,

298
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,040
so nobody would want to touch it.

299
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,740
He wouldn't have to go and dispose of it himself

300
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,340
because somebody else would probably do it for him anyway.

301
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,640
And unlike the wastebasket,

302
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,640
just in case he wanted to change the place he hid it,

303
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,340
it would be easy to retrieve.

304
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,840
Inspector! I found a strange plastic bag

305
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,040
inside the triangular garbage container in the kitchen.

306
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,440
You did!

307
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,740
If poison is detected from this bag

308
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,540
and your fingerprints are found on it...

309
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,940
I'm sure you'll find both.

310
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,540
I had it on me day and night so that I wouldn't miss

311
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,440
the chance to kill the president.

312
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:18,240
I first intended to kill him about 20 years ago.

313
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,440
Twenty years ago?

314
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,940
Yeah.

315
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,240
Not too long after you joined this office.

316
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,740
Do you remember when I went independent and quit the job here,

317
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,940
then came back again?

318
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,440
It was back then.

319
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,640
Yeah, I heard about it from the president some time ago.

320
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,740
You went independent, but couldn't make it,

321
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,240
so he accepted you again.

322
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,440
I couldn't make it?

323
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,040
There was no way I could make it.

324
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,840
Because the president was moving behind the scenes

325
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,340
and contacted the publishing companies,

326
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,140
telling them not to give a traitor any work.

327
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,240
Are you serious?

328
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,040
Yeah, a publisher friend told me.

329
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,440
I was also enraged then, to the point of no return.

330
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,240
I was thinking of how to kill him when he came back.

331
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,840
I was thinking all sorts of things in the kitchen.

332
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,440
Then it just so happened

333
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,940
that Akemi who was there with her parents

334
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,940
was standing behind me.

335
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,140
She asked me, "What's wrong? You look scary.

336
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,240
Are you looking for something?

337
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,740
Or are you hiding something?

338
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,240
Don't hide it in the triangular garbage container

339
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,840
because somebody might throw it away."

340
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,740
She remarked with a sad look on her face.

341
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,340
When I answered, "I think I was just tired",

342
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,340
she just smiled.

343
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,340
It was after that

344
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:49,440
that Akemi started hiding our things all over the place.

345
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,840
But after seeing her innocent smile,

346
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,640
my will to kill vanished off somewhere.

347
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,540
Then why did you decide to go through it at this time?

348
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,340
The other day, when I told the president

349
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:07,240
I wanted to go independent again, this is what he said.

350
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,140
"You would never make it at your age.

351
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,840
It would've been a different story

352
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,640
if this were 20 years ago though."

353
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,040
When I saw her again after such a long time,

354
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,340
I felt like anything was possible.

355
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,740
But the president's words made me blow my top.

356
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,640
"Her"?

357
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,140
Do you mean Akemi who came to use the restroom?

358
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,740
Yeah. I was kind of expecting her to come around again

359
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,740
after she smiled at me and said...

360
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,740
I'll come back again in about a week

361
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,540
with my younger sister.

362
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,240
But she never came.

363
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,340
I thought that she would

364
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,040
blow off my intent to kill with that smile of hers again,

365
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,040
but I guess I was just being selfish.

366
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,940
So?

367
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,940
You found it, didn't you?

368
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,840
When you went into the restroom with Dr. Agasa.

369
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,940
The thing that Akemi hid.

370
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,740
Yeah.

371
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,340
It dawned on me when they said,

372
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,940
as soon as your sister came to use the restroom,

373
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,340
President Dejima started nagging them

374
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,440
about saving water all of a sudden.

375
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,840
An object must've been attached

376
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,940
to the float in the toilet tank

377
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,840
which caused the water to flow out little by little.

378
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,540
I opened the tank and checked behind the float.

379
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,740
And it turned out that a plastic bag with something inside it

380
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,440
was firmly attached to the float with masking tape.

381
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,740
There were traces of old masking tape on it too,

382
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,040
so it's most likely that 20 years ago,

383
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,040
your sister took Mr. Imai's words,

384
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,540
"I think I'm just tired" too seriously

385
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,640
and hid the pens and rulers

386
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,440
so he could take a rest from work.

387
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,240
Then, 20 years later, she came back again,

388
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,540
removed the things she had hidden

389
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,640
and replaced them with these.

390
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,740
She put these cassette tapes

391
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,940
numbered from 1 to 20 in this plastic bag.

392
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,740
Cassette tapes?

393
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,040
Yeah. I think that there's at least some clues

394
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,840
about those guys in here.

395
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,240
Some really important information

396
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,640
that she wishes to keep a secret

397
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,940
from the Men in Black who are watching her.

398
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,440
Hey! Don't tell me

399
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,440
that you're listening to it now?

400
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,040
Yeah. I'm listening to the one numbered 11 to 15,

401
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,640
but the top part of the tape is blank,

402
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,940
so I haven't heard anything yet.

403
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,540
No, don't!

404
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,640
It's something you don't need to know about!

405
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,140
If you delve any deeper, you'll really...

406
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,640
Sorry, Ai.

407
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,040
This is definitely a tape I shouldn't be listening to.

408
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,440
It's yours. A voice only for you.

409
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,440
Listen to it.

410
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,140
To Shiho who has turned 11 years old.

411
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,940
Happy birthday.

412
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,940
Mother?

413
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,940
Have you found somebody you like?

414
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,340
My first love was when...

415
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,840
She probably gave the tape to Akemi

416
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,840
after feeling that her life would soon be ending.

417
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,440
She sent words to her maturing daughter

418
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,540
about the love she felt for her.

419
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,440
Akemi who received the tape

420
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,440
couldn't give it to Ai because of severe monitoring.

421
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,340
But she probably remembered hiding things

422
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,440
at the design office in the past and hid it in the toilet there

423
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,140
so she could secretly give it to you.

424
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,840
I'm happy for you, Ai.

425
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,140
Mother...

426
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,540
Your mother was genuinely an angel.

427
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,940
Sorry to keep you waiting.

428
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,240
I don't think I'll need any help from you.

429
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,140
Get her the minute you see her. Understand?

430
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,540
Calvados.
