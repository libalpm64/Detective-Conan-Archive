1
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:13,090
"Detective Conan"

2
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,590
"Special"

3
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,890
Isn't it rare? A museum.

4
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,090
Aren't you curious what he looks like?

5
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,240
I'm sure he's a nice man!

6
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,640
Like Harrison Ford, John Reno or maybe Brad Pitt.

7
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,840
I hear that he collects famous jewellery from the world over

8
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,040
and holds exhibitions.

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,840
I hear that you get to see the largest black pearl in the world.

10
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,140
Is that the pearl that is said to bring happiness,

11
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,240
the black pearl called the "Black Star"?

12
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,740
"Saturday night when the moon is full,"

13
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,140
"at the sound of the bell at midnight,"

14
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,540
"I will appear to take the clock that soars high above away."

15
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,940
Three steel crows in the dark of the night.

16
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,940
Still yet beyond... there are two more.

17
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,140
Oops, they've even got an armored vehicle ready.

18
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,540
Just as expected of the Metropolitan Police Department.

19
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,340
They've sure gone all out!

20
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,040
Don't, Kaito.

21
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,340
I have an uncomfortable feeling about this project.

22
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,640
If you are cornered into a fix like before,

23
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,340
and if something should ever happen to you,

24
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,240
I, as your steward, wouldn't be able to apologize to him

25
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,040
before his altar.

26
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,240
Gosh!

27
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,140
You're always like this before a big project.

28
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,840
Give me a break, will you? Here!

29
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,040
But, Kaito...

30
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,340
Besides, tonight I'm not the son of Toichi Kurobane,

31
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,040
the magician whom you served as steward for

32
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,840
nor am I Kaito the 8th grader!

33
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,540
I'm the one who is the talk of the town right now.

34
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,440
I'm just a villain who's putting on airs.

35
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,140
Kaito.

36
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,730
"The Detectives Come Together!"

37
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,230
"Kudo VS. Thief Kid"

38
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,530
"Ekoda High School" -Too easy.

39
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,130
Way too easy.

40
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,130
The next job is duck soup that I could complete it

41
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,930
with the tip of my pinky.

42
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,330
Women fans entranced by Thief Kid are rapidly on the rise!

43
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,630
Talk about just great.

44
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,630
Women fans on the rise, my foot!

45
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,530
That petty thief!

46
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,130
To me, Aoko, he's just a rotten apple of a man

47
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,530
running down the path of hopelessness!

48
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,630
Oh, well...

49
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,830
Cool it, don't be angry.

50
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,830
Just because you father, that dorky inspector

51
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,530
is always being undone by him.

52
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,430
It can't be helped, can it?

53
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,430
After all, the Kid is...

54
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,430
One. Two.

55
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,030
There!

56
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,530
A great thief that is impossible to arrest!

57
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,330
Anyway, as for that Inspector,

58
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,130
he wouldn't be able to arrest the Kid

59
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,530
even if Star Wars were to come up with a completed version.

60
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,630
Gosh! Just because you resemble the Kid

61
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,430
and can perform a little bit of magic,

62
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,430
you're always sticking up for him.

63
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,630
That guy's seeking nothing more than self-satisfaction

64
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,430
by disposing what he steals

65
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,230
and returning it secretly later, a pretentious goody-goody!

66
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,230
Oh my.

67
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,430
That's the very thing I like about him.

68
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,830
He's cute, just like a mischievous young boy.

69
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,730
Oh. Akako. Akako!

70
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,430
Don't let him deceive you!

71
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,630
That guy is nothing but a criminal,

72
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,530
no matter how you look at it! He is a villain!

73
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,430
Besides, you saw what the Kid is after next on TV, didn't you?

74
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,230
Oh, you mean the old clock tower in front of the station?

75
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,930
Right! That belongs to everyone here in this town!

76
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,330
So, don't you think it's terrible of him to steal it?

77
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,030
Yes. I guess so.

78
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,330
Moreover, that place is...

79
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,230
That clock tower is...

80
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,230
But, I heard that the clock tower was going to be moved

81
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,030
somewhere else soon anyway.

82
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,630
That it was going to be used as the symbol of some amusement park.

83
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,930
Keiko.

84
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,030
Everybody was saying that if it was going to be moved elsewhere,

85
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,330
it may as well be taken away by the Kid.

86
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,630
What's not good is not good!

87
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,630
Hey. I don't know what you're up to, but...

88
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,330
I really think you should call off the job

89
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,130
you're planning to carry out this time!

90
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:56,430
Listen, I've been telling you that I am not the Kid!

91
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,230
The old tower that tells time,

92
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,230
when the 20,000 bells sing.

93
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,430
A malevolent man will come flying from the eastern sky

94
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,230
and the white sinner shall be perished.

95
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,230
Is that some stupid something like fortune-telling again?

96
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,130
It's not fortune-telling.

97
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:15,230
It's a prophecy that has come to me through the devil, Lucifer.

98
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,830
Luci...

99
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,130
The day that clock sounds its bell for the 20,000th time

100
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,530
is the night that you warned you'll be carrying out your deed.

101
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:26,830
Whether you believe me or not is up to you, though.

102
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,930
To all vehicles, helicopters circling the sky

103
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,630
and police cars patrolling the vicinity of the clock tower.

104
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,730
Report any sightings of suspicious people to me immediately!

105
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,630
All of you who are in charge of

106
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,330
guarding the inside of the museum,

107
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,430
don't let anybody through without my orders!

108
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,830
Guard the post that you are assigned to

109
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,930
with your entire heart and soul!

110
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,630
But, Inspector Nakamori.

111
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,130
I wonder if Kid's really going to show up?

112
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,230
His warning went like this, right?

113
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,330
Saturday night when the moon is full,

114
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,830
at the sound of the bell at midnight,

115
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,530
I will appear to take the clock that soars high above away.

116
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,130
The Thief Kid.

117
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,130
I was thinking that he would have to use a darn big crane

118
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,130
if he were to take a clock that large away.

119
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,030
You idiot! When he says he'll steal something,

120
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:27,530
-he will! -The needle of the clock.

121
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,230
This clock tower

122
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,630
is one that my father who was mayor 50 years ago,

123
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,330
dished out a large sum

124
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,030
and asked a famous designer technician from abroad to make.

125
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,730
The short hand of the clock,

126
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,230
along with the signature of the designer

127
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,130
has several large diamonds embedded in it.

128
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,630
It is a highly evaluated work of art.

129
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,530
He's probably after the diamonds.

130
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,930
Why'd you let the owner through?

131
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,430
I'm sorry. He insisted that he wanted to check out

132
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,630
the conditions of security with his own eyes so.

133
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,930
I sure hope you checked thoroughly whether he is really the owner?

134
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,630
Why, of course.

135
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,830
Whatever you do.

136
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:07,230
Whatever you do, please protect it

137
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,930
from the evil hands of that petty thief that sent me

138
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,130
that ridiculous letter of challenging warning.

139
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,630
The dear clock tower that had inherited from my late father,

140
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,030
do protect it.

141
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,230
Yes. We will, owner.

142
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,030
I'm counting on you.

143
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,330
By the way, Inspector!

144
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:25,130
I haven't seen Police Superintendent Hakuba's son,

145
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,030
Saguru around lately.

146
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:31,030
Yeah. Something about he had some unfinished case to take care of

147
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,930
and went back to London.

148
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,930
We sure could've used his help, couldn't we?

149
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,130
-You idiot! -Oh, I'm so sorry!

150
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,030
What makes you think we can be counting on

151
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,430
that costume wearing freak time after time!

152
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:52,030
Only 28 minutes and 30 seconds till the promised time.

153
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,330
Here goes then.

154
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,430
Residing in Ekoda.

155
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:04,430
27 years old. Single, police officer Yoichi Sensui.

156
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,330
I'm going to borrow you name and face for a while.

157
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,630
Excuse me!

158
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:17,230
Kid...

159
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,030
Look at the number of onlookers.

160
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:23,130
Oh, owner! Owner, how was it inside?

161
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,930
"Sujio Hosokawa (32)" -Perfect!

162
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,830
"Takarada's assistant" -Not an ant can get through.

163
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,830
But I wonder if everything is okay

164
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,430
on the amusement park side.

165
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,230
Since it will not make it in time for the opening unless

166
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,030
the construction for moving the clock tower is started tomorrow,

167
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,030
purchase of the clock tower may be cancelled.

168
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,730
Moreover, if Kid ever steals the precious stones

169
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,630
that are embedded in the short hand of the clock,

170
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,630
and if he finds out that the stones are...

171
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,430
We're the only ones who know now,

172
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,830
that I have already sold the diamonds off

173
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,130
and switched them for fake ones.

174
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,630
Besides, the price of it has jumped high,

175
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,330
now that everyone knows the Thief Kid is after it,

176
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,630
and there wouldn't be a better time to sell it.

177
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,130
Whether they find out about the whole thing

178
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,730
after the relocation is none of my business.

179
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,230
Besides, it would never be stolen!

180
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,430
How could he ever steal that enormous clock tower

181
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:12,230
in front of all these people?

182
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:16,130
No matter how great a phantom thief he is!

183
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,230
Don't you dare come, Thief Kid!

184
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,230
Don't give it to him, Dad!

185
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,330
Hey! Hey, Aoko!

186
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,330
You're the only one saying something like that.

187
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:28,230
I know, but... By the way, Keiko, did you see Kaito?

188
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,330
Nope, not at all.

189
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,730
Oh, right, he said he's going to be watching a magic show

190
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,330
that is going to be aired tonight.

191
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,030
Oh.

192
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,830
I guess I'm the only one

193
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,630
who remembers something so old that happened in the past.

194
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,730
What?

195
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,330
You witnessed a suspicious looking Thief Kid like character

196
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,530
while on patrol?

197
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:49,930
Yes, sir! He dropped this suspicious looking hat and left.

198
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:53,730
This is Thief Kid's silk hat and cape!

199
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,130
Will you wait here a while?

200
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,630
-Yes, sir! -Inspector Nakamori, please.

201
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,830
Yes, the silk hat and cape are here.

202
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,630
Yes...

203
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,930
It seems so.

204
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,930
Okay! I've got approval from the Inspector!

205
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,130
Will you explain the circumstances back then

206
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,330
and the features of the man directly

207
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,630
to the Inspector who is at the top most floor?

208
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,130
-Yes, sir! -Kid!

209
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,030
Kid...

210
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,430
Duck soup!

211
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,930
Without Hakuba around, it's so easy that it's no fun after all.

212
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,130
Here they come, Akiko.

213
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,730
Yes. No doubt about it.

214
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,530
It's that helicopter.

215
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:39,830
He emits the same transparent vibe that Kaito emits.

216
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,930
He has the cunning of the devil,

217
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,730
and possesses a keen eye that sees through the hearts of people.

218
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,130
Who is he?

219
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:58,130
Hey! What's going on? There is one extra chopper!

220
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,130
It's another support helicopter sent over by headquarters.

221
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,930
Support from headquarters?

222
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,430
I don't recall asking for something like that!

223
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,830
The Thief Kid's silk hat, eh?

224
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,630
I've been informed of you.

225
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:11,730
Please show me your police I.D. and license, just to be sure.

226
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,930
Yes, of course!

227
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,930
Please give me your name, age and birth date.

228
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:23,830
Yoichi Sensui, 27 years old, born June 2nd.

229
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,530
Okay, good work!

230
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:28,430
Inspector Nakamori is waiting for you at the top floor.

231
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,230
Yes, sir.

232
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,430
Right, just in case, give me your driver's license number.

233
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,330
Oh, yes.

234
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:43,230
Yes, number 628605-524810.

235
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,230
He's the Thief Kid!

236
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,530
Nab him!

237
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,730
This can't be happening?

238
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,330
What?

239
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,930
You found the Thief Kid inside the building?

240
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:03,030
Yes, sir! The C and D groups are pursuing him right now!

241
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,830
Hey. Hey. I hope he's no imposter?

242
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,330
No, there's no mistake about it!

243
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,530
After he answered his name, age and birth date,

244
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:15,930
I remember I was told to ask for his driver's license number.

245
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,330
-His driver's license number? -Yes, sir!

246
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,230
The boy who was sent over by headquarters

247
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,930
had informed me that

248
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,730
if the thief is an expert at disguising himself as another,

249
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,830
he would probably remember what others

250
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,530
would usually not be able to recall.

251
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,730
A boy, you said?

252
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,730
I repeat.

253
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,230
Please close off the entrance and exit

254
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,930
of the clock tower immediately!

255
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,530
Please don't open them until we instruct you to.

256
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:45,230
He's no more than a mole in a hole that cannot move now.

257
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,130
D group, Nakamura and Kawada!

258
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,730
We've lost sight of him near the 3rd floor toilet.

259
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,030
Please calm down, I'm sure he is still somewhere near you.

260
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,330
What?

261
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,230
The ventilation hole that is beyond that toilet.

262
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,530
Aren't the screws removed?

263
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:09,830
It's been removed...

264
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,630
Then, he's in there! Please resume pursuing him!

265
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,230
There he is! It's him!

266
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:22,130
Hey. The inspector sure is sharp today.

267
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:26,030
Or, is someone helping the inspector out?

268
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,530
But, who could it be?

269
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,330
Megure! So, it's you after all!

270
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,630
Just what do you think you're doing,

271
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,730
bringing a kid to a place like this?

272
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:37,730
I'm the commander of this site!

273
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,530
And, besides, you don't belong in this section!

274
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,930
Well, I'm very sorry.

275
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,430
I promised that I'd let him board this chopper once.

276
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,030
So, I thought I may as well bring him along while I was at it.

277
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,930
-Huh? Hey! -Inspector!

278
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:54,530
I hate to be rude, but we've got no time debating with you.

279
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:58,430
If you want to arrest the thief, please follow my orders.

280
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,830
What?

281
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,430
He is thrown off at being identified

282
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,330
before having the chance to carry out his act.

283
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,830
His plan is not going as he planned.

284
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:12,030
There is no better chance to capture him, but now!

285
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,430
Who are you? Who the heck are you?

286
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,930
I am...

287
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,630
Shinichi Kudo.

288
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,730
A detective.

289
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,350
Shinichi Kudo?

290
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:38,350
Oh. I know him, I know him!

291
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,850
A high school detective who solves mysterious cases

292
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,750
one after the other.

293
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,250
Then, you're also in the wrong section!

294
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,450
We're after a thief!

295
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,150
Inspector! He's just a high school student

296
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,150
and belongs to no section...

297
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,450
At any rate, this is a job for the police to handle!

298
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,550
Outsiders just stay put in that chopper of yours!

299
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,550
Understand?

300
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,550
Inspector Nakamori!

301
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,150
Nakamura of the D group, after receiving word from the boy,

302
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,250
discovered the Thief Kid,

303
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,850
disguised as a police officer inside the ventilation duct!

304
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,350
They are still pursuing him!

305
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,450
What?

306
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,250
Nakamura of the D group here!

307
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,350
It seems that our target is trying to exit

308
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,850
from the ventilation duct!

309
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,450
What should we do?

310
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,650
Don't panic.

311
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,950
Your target is already caught in your claws.

312
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,250
Please tell me your present location.

313
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,150
Well, since I was moving along in the dark,

314
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,850
I'm not so sure of where I am.

315
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,250
I know that I went up one flight of stairs from the 3rd floor

316
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,750
and that this is the 4th floor.

317
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,250
No problem! The exits of all the 28 ventilation holes there

318
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,250
are within the building have all been closed off!

319
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,150
Please just keep on pursuing him.

320
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,950
There is no escape route for him anymore.

321
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:41,950
The officers who are blocking off

322
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,350
the exit of the ventilation hole on the 4th floor

323
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,050
should get ready to arrest him.

324
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:48,950
How dare he giving out orders on his own again?

325
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,850
This is Nakamura of D group!

326
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,750
I lost sight of him near the exit of the ventilation duct!

327
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,150
What is your present location?

328
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,150
This is...

329
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,150
The corridor to the east on the 4th floor!

330
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,850
Huh?

331
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,250
The target has gotten rid of his disguise as an officer

332
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,850
and is fleeing down the stairs.

333
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,550
Please send a support force over right away.

334
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,150
Thief Kid...

335
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,550
Great work, officer.

336
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:16,150
Okay! He panicked and got rid of his disguise as an officer!

337
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,950
Everyone proceed to the fourth floor and capture the thief!

338
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,950
Don't let him get away!

339
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,850
But, why does that boy have so much information

340
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:26,750
as to the structure of this clock tower?

341
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,050
Of course! Because I sent him the data

342
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:32,650
that I have in this computer over to him a while ago.

343
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,550
You idiot.

344
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,750
Strange.

345
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,150
For him to remove his disguise as an officer in the space

346
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,150
that is surrounded by officers,

347
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,650
is like a hermit crab disposing of its shell

348
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,050
and roaming within the sea.

349
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,850
To me, that is incomprehensible.

350
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,850
It's time, Inspector Nakamori.

351
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,350
Oh, yeah.

352
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,050
Inspector!

353
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,450
Smoke has burst forth from the foothold

354
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,650
at the construction site!

355
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,150
What?

356
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,850
Inspector Nakamori! The hands of the clock are gone!

357
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,950
What? They're gone?

358
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,550
It...

359
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,650
It can't be.

360
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,450
Wow! The Thief Kid is really something.

361
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,450
Thief Kid.

362
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,250
I hate you, Thief Kid.

363
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,650
Is anything wrong?

364
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,050
It's swaying?

365
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,450
Yeah, you mean this chopper is swaying?

366
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,250
-No, Inspector! -No?

367
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,150
Inspector, where are you headed?

368
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,850
I'm going to go up and check the engine room of the clock.

369
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:52,850
Could you please bring the chopper closer to the clock tower?

370
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,850
Darn! What the heck is going on anyway?

371
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,850
Anything new?

372
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,150
No.

373
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,650
What the...

374
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,650
Hey, what happened?

375
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:10,750
A police officer appeared from the ventilation duct and...

376
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,950
What?

377
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,350
After spraying something strange at us,

378
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,950
he went out from there.

379
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,350
It... it can't be.

380
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,550
If so, he should be clearly visible to those outside.

381
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,150
Thief Kid!

382
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,750
Thief Kid...

383
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:36,250
It's me! Nakamori! I've found Kid!

384
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,750
He is...

385
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,850
Inspector Nakamori.

386
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,050
My apologies that

387
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:48,050
I have no time now to be playing with all of you.

388
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,250
What?

389
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,450
Besides, it seems that you have a "joker"

390
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,350
who is pretty sharp on your side too.

391
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,450
On our side?

392
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,950
And, if you're going to summon anybody,

393
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,050
I'd like you to do so after.

394
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,450
I'd like you to decipher the code that has been carved

395
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,950
in the middle of the face of the clock.

396
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,550
Code?

397
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:09,650
Yes, I'd like you to decipher it before calling anyone.

398
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,150
The face of the clock is swaying?

399
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,050
What is the meaning of this, Kudo?

400
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,850
He is lighting up the face of the clock together

401
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,950
with the curtain of smoke.

402
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,150
The light is turned off, and the face of the clock is covered

403
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,850
with a gigantic screen that has been set up beforehand

404
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,850
and projected on the screen is a film

405
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,350
of the hand of the clock disappearing.

406
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,050
The film is projected from a projector that

407
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:34,050
has been assembled onto a foothold at a construction site.

408
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:38,250
But, it's so easy to figure that trick out.

409
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,450
That trick...

410
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,050
fake!

411
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,850
He's probably behind the screen right now

412
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:48,850
removing the diamonds that are embedded

413
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,150
in the short hand of the clock.

414
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,050
I'm going to borrow this for a while.

415
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,950
Hey! Who is it? Who's firing the gun?

416
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,950
Darn.

417
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,950
With the chopper at such close range,

418
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,150
I can't possibly fly using my hand glider.

419
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,150
What shall I do? What now?

420
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,050
Hey, Kudo!

421
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,850
Don't worry! I won't hit anyone.

422
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:26,350
No! That's not the point. Kudo!

423
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:32,050
Now, for the finale of your magic show.

424
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:35,250
Let's watch the leader of the troupe appear.

425
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,410
What a guy!

426
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:07,110
To fall onto the crowd together with the screen.

427
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:09,710
It's impossible to find him among that crowd.

428
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,960
Yes. Megure here.

429
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,660
Hey! Megure! Are you the one who fired?

430
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,760
No. I'm not the one who fired.

431
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,560
By the way, Inspector, didn't he leave a message with you?

432
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:30,360
Yeah, he did. Something about a code.

433
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,060
Code?

434
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,560
This is Greek to me.

435
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,160
Was a letter like this

436
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,260
really carved in the center of the face of the clock?

437
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,860
Yeah. That's it!

438
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,860
At any rate, that's important evidence.

439
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,160
We've got to have them postpone moving the clock tower

440
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,860
until the code is deciphered.

441
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,860
I don't need you to tell me that.

442
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,760
Well, I guess all is well since the clock tower is safe

443
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,760
and his plan didn't work out.

444
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,860
No, Inspector Megure.

445
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,960
He left a code on the face of the clock

446
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,060
and left the clock tower up to the police to take care of.

447
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,660
He took the clock tower away from the hands of the owner

448
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,460
who was planning to have it moved.

449
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,260
Besides, it's written in the code, see?

450
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,260
You change the Katakana characters to Roman characters,

451
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:29,760
and move the vowels one space each clockwise and read it.

452
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,460
It says, "The bell will not toll for you."

453
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,860
Come to think of it,

454
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:39,960
I still haven't asked you the name of the thief.

455
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,160
Oh, well... I guess it doesn't really matter.

456
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,860
Huh? Are you waiting for somebody too?

457
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,460
I'm going out with daddy.

458
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,060
But, he said he may be busy with work,

459
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,960
so we might not be able to go.

460
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,860
Here you go.

461
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,460
I'm Kaito Kurobane! Nice meeting you!

462
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,060
I'm Kaito Kurobane, nice meeting you!

463
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,760
Kaito!

464
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,260
I wouldn't forget, you idiot.

465
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,760
Kaito. Is anything the matter?

466
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,460
Thanks to your remark I just remembered something!

467
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,060
The clock tower incident, when I was really in a fix.

468
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,560
And, whatever became of that clock tower?

469
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,660
Oh, yeah, you don't know about it since you moved.

470
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,860
Then, it has since been moved over after all.

471
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,760
Three. Two.

472
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,060
One!

473
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,660
This is the sound of...

474
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,360
The police investigated afterwards,

475
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,660
and found that the diamonds were fake,

476
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,060
so the city bought it for a cheap price.

477
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,060
Okay! Shall we get going then?

478
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,060
His real target is the "Big Jewel".

479
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,960
The jewel in the possession of the Suzuki Financial Group,

480
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,560
the "Black Star"!

481
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,560
Kaito, I'm not about to stop you at this point.

482
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,760
But, Toichi used to always say.

483
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,460
Making contact with a client is always a battlefield.

484
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,560
Never be conceited, or take them lightly.

485
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,260
Look into their hearts,

486
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,660
and concentrate all your nerves to look through them.

487
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,160
Give it all the skills you have,

488
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,660
yet, keep smiling and be gracious...

489
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,760
No matter what happens,

490
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,260
never forget putting on a poker face, right?

491
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,960
Kaito.

492
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,660
I'm back!

493
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,460
You've got mail.

494
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,360
Oh, no! What is this? It gives me the creeps.

495
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,260
What's all the fuss about, Ran?

496
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,760
Well, take a look at this, see.

497
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,160
"Mr. Kogoro Mouri" is written in calligraphic

498
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,360
white letters on a black envelope.

499
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,160
No stamp, no name of sender.

500
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,660
It's probably a new type of "please join us" direct mails.

501
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:50,460
I wonder.

502
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,160
What is it?

503
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,360
In honor of your wisdom,

504
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,760
we would like to invite you to a dinner gathering.

505
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,460
See, what did I tell you? Just what I thought it was.

506
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,060
I'll bet they're just trying to add some class

507
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,060
to their party by inviting a detective.

508
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,260
I don't think so.

509
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:13,060
See, because this fell out of the envelope,

510
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,660
2,000,000 yen is written on it, right?

511
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,760
2,000,000 yen?

512
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,560
Wouldn't it be awfully strange to send something like this

513
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,760
just for something like that?

514
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,560
And, they don't even know if you're going to come or not yet.

515
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,360
Hey, dad.

516
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,960
Isn't the name of the sender somewhere inside?

517
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,860
Now, what is this?

518
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:41,260
The Phantom of a God Forsaken Child.

519
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,360
How creepy.

520
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,060
The Phantom of a God Forsaken Child...

521
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,860
Be strong I say to my heart.

522
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,660
And step into the essence with strong rhythm.

523
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,560
The curtains are raised for Detective Conan's 21st Century's episode.

524
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,460
Six other detectives appear including Kid.

525
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,060
He sees through the one and only truth.

526
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,960
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

527
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,260
His name is Detective Conan!

528
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,560
Conan, can you check the tire over that side?

529
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,460
What's wrong, dad?

530
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,260
Wow! The tire on this side is super flat.

531
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,860
Huh? A flat tire?

532
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,260
What bummers.

533
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,860
There's no spare tire! Darn it!

534
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,260
-Hey, Pops. -What is it?

535
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,660
See, over there.

536
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:25,560
There's a service station over there!

537
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,260
Wow, talk about lucky.

538
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,760
A Buddha in hell indeed.

539
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,860
Darn, shortcut, my foot!

540
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:10,260
How dare that guy at the service station tell us to use this road!

541
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:14,460
Dad, is this really the right road?

542
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,560
Of course!

543
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,160
He took me into his stand

544
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,460
and sold this really expensive map,

545
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,360
that he insisted was very explanatory of this area too!

546
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,060
If this isn't the right road, he's going to pay for it!

547
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,760
So, we've finally come out to a normal looking road.

548
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,660
I guess he wasn't lying when he said that this was a shortcut.

549
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,960
Because, see, isn't that it on the right hand side?

550
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,160
The place that we're headed for.

551
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,860
It sure is an eerie looking building.

552
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:55,360
It looks more like Dracula's mansion, than Twilight Inn to me.

553
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,560
Hey, dad, are we really going there?

554
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,960
To a place like that.

555
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,160
You idiot!

556
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,360
We've got no choice after getting an invitation like that.

557
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,760
There was a 2,000,000 yen stamp enclosed in the letter too besides.

558
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,560
But wasn't there something eerie written by the sender?

559
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,460
Oh, about the child forsaken by God thing.

560
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,060
Don't worry about it.

561
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,960
It's just somebody bluffing nonsense.

562
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,960
I wonder.

563
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,460
Let's not go, after all.

564
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,260
We've already come this far.

565
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:35,060
But, what if a Dracula really appears?

566
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,660
Don't be ridiculous.

567
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,560
There is no such thing as Dracula in Japan.

568
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,660
If there is anything, it would be, a mountain witch.

569
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,660
Mountain witch!

570
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:02,260
Now, what a way to greet a woman at first meeting.

571
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,860
Oh, I'm so sorry.

572
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,760
What are you doing out in a place like this, granny?

573
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:13,560
Most obviously, my cute little Fiat stalled on me.

574
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,760
So, I was waiting for someone to come by.

575
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,060
You folks are going to the Twilight Inn too, aren't you?

576
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,060
If it's not too much trouble, would you give me a lift?

577
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,760
Yes, why not?

578
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,760
Go ahead and ride in the back seat.

579
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,760
And, while you're at it,

580
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,360
would you please move my things from my Fiat into your car?

581
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,760
Oh, all right.

582
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,460
Thank you so much.

583
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,960
Do we have a while more to go?

584
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,060
Huh?

585
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,860
We've just got a little more to go,

586
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,060
but, is anything wrong?

587
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,060
I've got to go to the ladies room!

588
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,260
Come on.

589
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,660
Miss?

590
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,460
I guess it's none of the business

591
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,460
but, the principal of the elementary school of our town

592
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,460
used to always say

593
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,760
that people who succeed in life,

594
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,460
are those who never let an opportunity go by.

595
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,560
Once you let the opportunity go by, thinking that

596
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,660
the same sort of opportunity may come by again,

597
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:22,460
no matter how long you wait for it to come by, it never will.

598
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,560
Why didn't you finish what you wanted to do

599
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,060
when you stopped over at the service station a while ago?

600
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,260
How did you know, granny?

601
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,760
That we stopped over at the service station.

602
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,360
Very easy, little one.

603
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,960
See, over there. The empty ashtray

604
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,960
and the still new cigarette butts on the floor.

605
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,560
Filling the ashtray up

606
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,760
until the cigarettes fall to the floor

607
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,560
goes to show that you are a heavy smoker.

608
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,760
Yet, the ashtray is empty.

609
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,260
The only place you could've emptied it,

610
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:56,660
is at the service station about 10 kilometers away.

611
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,260
A gentleman who is nice enough

612
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,660
to give a strange old lady a lift

613
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,860
would never throw his cigarettes out of the window of his car

614
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,560
in front of a young lady.

615
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,460
Hey, granny.

616
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,760
Who on earth are you?

617
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,560
I am Furuyo Senma. A detective just like you.

618
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,060
Mr. Sleeping Kogoro.

619
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,360
Furuyo Senma.

620
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,160
The famous one who solves cases

621
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,560
just by listening about cases in a comfy chair.

622
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,760
Come on, flattering an old lady will not get you anywhere.

623
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,360
So, she's the one.

624
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:33,660
Well then, I guess I'll keep this ashtray for now.

625
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,660
Hey, wait!

626
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:39,660
Even if we get to the inn, don't ever smoke in front of me.

627
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:43,460
I hate the smoke of cigarettes.

628
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,060
Darn.

629
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,660
There's the Twilight In right in front of us.

630
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,460
Give it all you got and step on the gas.

631
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,630
"Twilight Inn"

632
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,330
Let's see.

633
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,330
Dad, open the back, please.

634
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:47,230
The closer you get to it, the more it looks like a haunted house.

635
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:50,230
Dad, I'm going to go on inside!

636
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,130
The ladies room...

637
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:59,730
Wow! Look at all those fantastic cars!

638
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:04,930
A Bentz, a Ferrari, a Porsche.

639
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:07,630
It sure is full of dangerous cars.

640
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:10,830
It's an Alfa Romeo!

641
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:13,830
-Classy. -Hey!

642
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:20,030
Don't you go touching my girl like that.

643
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:24,430
This one's a shrewd that I finally tamed after 5 years.

644
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,830
I don't want her to get upset over

645
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:29,530
some strange man touching her.

646
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:31,430
Right, flimsy mustache?

647
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,730
Flimsy mustache?

648
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:36,030
Hi there Mogi, it's been a while.

649
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,030
You were invited over too?

650
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,030
Hey! Granny Senma.

651
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,630
Which means you were invited here too.

652
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,530
Mogi?

653
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,830
He's Detective Harufumi Mogi.

654
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:49,930
Are you all right, though?

655
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:52,030
I read in the papers that you were shot

656
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,730
by a Mafia in Chicago last week.

657
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:58,030
I've forgotten something so old.

658
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:01,330
And? Have you come around to wanting to get married yet?

659
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,730
You're going to be 40 in three days, aren't you?

660
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:07,230
Heck... who knows about the future?

661
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,930
Right now, all I want is

662
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:13,630
something to ease my aching stomach.

663
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:24,230
Welcome,

664
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:27,930
Mr. Mogi. Mr. Mouri and Ms. Senma, I believe.

665
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,530
We've been waiting for you.

666
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,330
Please come in.

667
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:38,730
Oh. Well, this is...

668
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:40,930
A haunted house?

669
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:44,430
Please put your umbrellas here.

670
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,630
Oh, okay.

671
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,830
-Hey, you! -Yes, sir!

672
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,630
Please excuse me.

673
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:55,130
I just went to the kitchen, but...

674
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,630
If I remember correctly, he's...

675
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,930
The gourmet detective...

676
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,730
Shukuzen Ogami.

677
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:04,830
What? The cook suddenly fell ill and can't come?

678
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,430
You've broken your promise.

679
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:10,030
I've come all this way looking forward to the dinner!

680
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,930
I'm so very sorry.

681
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:14,030
I've bought all the ingredients necessary to make dinner, though.

682
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,330
Okay, forget it already!

683
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,730
Lend me your kitchen! I'll make dinner!

684
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,030
Gourmet food and murder

685
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:21,630
are treasures I cherish that uplift

686
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:24,330
and stimulate my brain cells!

687
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:26,030
Darn it!

688
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,330
I'm so sorry

689
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:34,130
to have kept you waiting.

690
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:37,430
Why did you summon four detectives up to a remote place

691
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:40,130
in the mountains like this for?

692
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:44,830
Well, we actually invited six detectives all together.

693
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:46,430
Hey,

694
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:48,830
are you telling me that there are two more detectives?

695
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:52,030
Yes, another woman and a young man.

696
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,630
Young man? Don't tell me it's Shinichi?

697
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:58,130
No way! I think it's Heiji.

698
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,730
Right?

699
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:06,230
No. Two other detectives were also included in the master's list,

700
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,730
but Mr. Kudo could not be contacted

701
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,730
and as for Mr. Hattori, we got a call from his mother

702
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,530
saying that he can't make it

703
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:15,030
because he's got an exam coming up.

704
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:17,430
Because those two were cancelled,

705
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:20,430
the master agree Mr. Mouri

706
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:23,430
to bring two members of his family.

707
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:28,830
Oh, and where is this detective lover weirdo?

708
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:32,630
I have no idea, since I, myself has never met him yet.

709
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:35,330
Huh? But, you got the list from him, didn't you?

710
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:39,330
Yes. I did get this list when I came here for an interview

711
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,930
to be hired as a maid.

712
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:44,130
But, it was a very peculiar type of interview.

713
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,430
Peculiar?

714
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:48,130
Yes, since it was a high paying job,

715
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,830
people wanting the position crowded over here.

716
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:53,630
When I entered the interview room,

717
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,930
all I saw there were a computer,

718
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,930
an explanation of the dinner

719
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:01,130
and a list of the invitees on the desk.

720
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:03,730
Nobody was in the room.

721
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:04,830
So, having no choice

722
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:08,930
I started reading the papers as instructed on the PC.

723
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,730
Suddenly, I heard a noise.

724
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:13,530
Then, I saw the sentence, "You are hired"

725
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,530
on the screen of the computer.

726
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:20,930
Then, you don't know why you were hired?

727
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:24,230
-No. -But, you must've at least heard his voice?

728
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:27,330
You did say that he gave you an okay, didn't you?

729
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:29,430
Well, all the details

730
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:33,530
were exchanged by mail using the cell phone.

731
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:38,330
Wow. This sounds really interesting.

732
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:41,330
The thrill is killing me.

733
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:45,130
I was already electrified the minute I saw

734
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:47,030
that strange pattern on that door!

735
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:50,530
It sure does look strange.

736
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:52,430
I wonder what it is a pattern of?

737
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:54,130
Be careful, baby.

738
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:55,130
If I'm not mistaken,

739
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:56,830
that probably the remains of an old blood stain.

740
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:58,630
What?

741
00:42:58,630 --> 00:42:59,930
Yuk.

742
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,730
You're joking, aren't you?

743
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,930
No, they're real blood stains.

744
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:08,730
The remains of blood that had splattered

745
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:12,630
at just about a 45-degree angle to the door.

746
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,730
Not only the door. On the wall

747
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,030
there are the remains of blood stains streaming downward.

748
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:18,730
On the floor, there are droplet blood stains.

749
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,630
Although they have been wiped away,

750
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,430
there is blood stains soaked here and there

751
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:24,830
everywhere in this house.

752
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:28,530
It seems that these blood stains

753
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:30,830
are not just those of one or two people.

754
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:32,730
Just as expected of you.

755
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:38,730
Luminol.

756
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:41,630
When it is sprayed onto blood stains,

757
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:44,930
it is oxidizes because of the active oxygen within the blood,

758
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:49,130
and emits a bluish purple fluorescent color.

759
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:54,630
You make good deductions, ex-coroner. Ms. Ikumi Souda.

760
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:58,730
My, you're smart.

761
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:01,030
Boy.

762
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:04,630
I am Saguru Hakuba. Nice to meet you all.

763
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:06,630
Hakuba?

764
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:08,930
You mean you're Police Superintendent, Habuba's...

765
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:10,030
Yes.

766
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:14,030
Police Superintendent Hakuba is my father indeed,

767
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:15,430
Mr. Mouri.

768
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,030
An eagle?

769
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:26,330
Oh, I'm sorry to have scared you.

770
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:30,330
Whether it was because Watson here was accompanying me in Britain,

771
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:33,630
I'm not sure, but he has become very sensitive to the smell of blood.

772
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,330
Watson?

773
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:38,530
I'm sure glad I came all the way back home, though.

774
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:40,630
After all, here I am standing at the scene

775
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:44,230
of the tragedy that has been hidden for ages.

776
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:48,030
One that I have only heard of as rumors.

777
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:50,230
I'm here at last after a period of 40 years.

778
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:52,430
This is more than I could ask for to awaken my intellectual excitement.

779
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:54,430
Tragedy?

780
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:10,730
No...

781
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:12,630
You're pretty good.

782
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:15,230
I've been playing awhile.

783
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:22,730
How about this, Mr. Sleeping Kogoro?

784
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,130
All right!

785
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:27,530
Look, look, I've got a straight!

786
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:29,730
So, I win again!

787
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:32,730
She sure is as strong as ever.

788
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,530
Wait a minute.

789
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:39,130
Now, let's not cheat, Ran.

790
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:41,030
See, the Jack to your very left.

791
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,830
You've got one on top of the other, don't you?

792
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:46,130
Huh? Oh, you're right.

793
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:48,830
I'm sorry, I didn't realize it.

794
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:53,130
They seem to have been stuck together from the start, though.

795
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,830
What's wrong, Ran?

796
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:01,530
There's blood on the playing card.

797
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:06,330
My, my, blood has splattered there too, I see.

798
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,430
Come to think of it, the maid was saying,

799
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:09,430
that the things here

800
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:11,130
are just as they were at the time of the crime.

801
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:13,930
That practically nothing had been moved.

802
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:16,530
Which means that something happened in this room too...

803
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:20,830
Thank you all for waiting.

804
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:24,730
Dinner is ready, so please come to the dining room.

805
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:26,830
The master is waiting for you.

806
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:28,930
So, the big boss finally makes his appearance.

807
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:30,530
I can't wait to see him.

808
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:39,630
I somehow don't seem to have an appetite.

809
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:46,030
Here we are.

810
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:53,630
Please go on inside.

811
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:03,230
Hey, hey, what's with that attire of yours?

812
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:05,230
I think you've been watching too much TV.

813
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:08,730
To you all, the distinguished and famed 6 detectives!

814
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:12,830
Welcome to the Twilight Inn.

815
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:17,230
Well then, won't you all take your seats?

816
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:27,630
Take the dishes out just like I instructed to you a while ago.

817
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:29,230
Yes, sir.

818
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:33,030
Now, the reason why I invited you all over here is because...

819
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:35,930
I want you to find the treasure

820
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:39,130
that I have hidden somewhere in here.

821
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:41,030
I want you to find the enormous amount of riches

822
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:43,530
that I have accumulated over the years.

823
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:46,130
And, risk your lives to do so.

824
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:48,430
Risk our lives?

825
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:53,930
What was that sound?

826
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:55,530
No need to worry.

827
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:58,130
I just made sure that you'd be stranded here.

828
00:47:58,130 --> 00:47:59,230
What?

829
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:03,230
I am always being chased around by all of you.

830
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:04,930
So, I thought I'd experience

831
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:08,230
being the one to corner you for once.

832
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:10,630
Besides, I also did away with the bridge

833
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:12,530
that you crossed to come here,

834
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:13,930
so even if you had your cars,

835
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:16,730
you wouldn't have been able to make it out of here anyway.

836
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:19,530
Of course there is no telephone here

837
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,630
and the cell phone is out of range of the waves.

838
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:25,730
So it is impossible to get help from someone on the outside.

839
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:28,630
Yes. Half of the treasure,

840
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:31,130
as well as the solution as to how to get out of here

841
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:34,530
will be given only to the one who finds the treasure.

842
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:36,530
This is the game.

843
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:38,830
How do you like the idea?

844
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:43,630
I just don't take well to people like you

845
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:47,230
who go around fleeing about hiding under a mask like that.

846
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:53,930
Come now, you can't work on an empty stomach.

847
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,130
Please enjoy the dinner to your heart's content.

848
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:58,230
A speaker is attached to the neck of a mannequin?

849
00:48:58,230 --> 00:48:59,830
Darn it!

850
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:01,230
Who...

851
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,230
Who on earth could be doing this?

852
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:05,530
My. A person as renown as you, Mr. Mouri

853
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:08,130
had no idea why you were called here?

854
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:11,330
It was written in black and white in the invitation letter.

855
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:15,930
"The Phantom Of A God Forsaken Child."

856
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:18,930
The phantom.

857
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:20,330
That is something that appears unexpectedly

858
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:22,030
and has no concrete body.

859
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:24,130
The word "child" in the sentence

860
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:25,930
refers to the child of a beast,

861
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:27,930
because this character is used to write words

862
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:29,430
like colt and puppy in Japanese.

863
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:32,730
"The God forsaken beast" in the New Testament,

864
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:36,230
refers to the goat that could not receive the blessings of God.

865
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:39,830
Therefore, it refers to a baby goat.

866
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:42,430
And, of course, a goat is a goat,

867
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:45,830
but a baby goat in English is called...

868
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:49,130
-a kid. -What?

869
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:52,630
Maybe this will make it easier to understand.

870
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:55,130
Kid the phantom thief.

871
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:57,230
Hey, don't tell me that...

872
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:58,830
Don't tell me that...

873
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:01,730
Right. He never lets the prey that he is after escape.

874
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:05,230
The way he carries out his feat is practically like magic.

875
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:07,930
He is a genius criminal that confuses the police

876
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:11,130
with faces and voices that are as limitless as the stars.

877
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:16,830
He's the main dish that we, the detectives drool to savor.

878
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:18,430
He's a stuck up villain

879
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:20,330
that I would sure like to throw into jail.

880
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:24,830
He is the only existence so far, that ever threw me off.

881
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:28,630
People who have seen him in dark dressed in his white outfit

882
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:31,130
call him...

883
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:33,430
The Thief Kid!

884
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:42,720
The Thief Kid.

885
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:45,820
He's an honest guy.

886
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,520
The minute his name was mentioned,

887
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,420
he showed signs of his identity.

888
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:54,420
I sensed your piercing, callous presence.

889
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:58,720
No doubt about it, he is here, inside this house.

890
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,920
I don't know what he's up to, but...

891
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,220
I wonder if he can continue deceiving

892
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:07,620
the 7 detectives who are gathered here.

893
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,620
Then, are you saying that

894
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:14,320
the Thief Kid is the one who invited us here?

895
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,120
Yeah, it seems that he gathered the six of us

896
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,520
who have a reputation of being good detectives here

897
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,320
to compete intelligence.

898
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,820
By staking the treasure that he had stolen up to now,

899
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:27,320
as well as our lives.

900
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:32,020
He's probably watching us from somewhere this very minute.

901
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:36,120
I found surveillance cameras all over this place.

902
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,920
What?

903
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,720
This is an appetizer.

904
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:54,020
So, the last supper that he is referring to has finally come.

905
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:00,020
Excuse me, maid?

906
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,720
Oh, yes.

907
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,720
Did by any chance the master instruct you on

908
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,920
which order to place the dishes on the table?

909
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,820
Yes. I was told to place the dishes on the table

910
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,620
starting with Mr. Hakuba and continue on clockwise.

911
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:14,020
Well...

912
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:17,620
It just bothered me that he was calling this the last supper

913
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:22,120
despite the game having just begun.

914
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,020
There's no poison in the food,

915
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,320
because I'm the one who made it.

916
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:30,320
But, the forks, knives and spoons,

917
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,620
the wine glasses and tea cups

918
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:35,620
have been placed on the table beforehand.

919
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:39,420
We all seated ourselves according to where we found our name plates.

920
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:44,220
Well, I don't think he intends to commit murder,

921
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:47,120
but he may set up an unlaughable joke

922
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:50,020
to test our capabilities.

923
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,620
It may be wiser to wipe your glass cup and fork

924
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:55,920
with your own handkerchief before eating.

925
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,520
No doubt about it.

926
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,420
I don't like the idea that things are being carried out

927
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:00,920
as he planned.

928
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,120
Would you like to do a game of stone, paper, scissors

929
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,320
and change seats then?

930
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:08,720
But, what if someone ill-fatedly gets the poisoned seat?

931
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:13,920
That's that, take it as fate, and cry in the coffin.

932
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,720
Oh, no.

933
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,820
Boy, that sure was good.

934
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,920
Just as expected of a gourmet detective!

935
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,520
You've really got fantastic talent for cooking too, don't you?

936
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,420
I went through a lot of training

937
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,720
to satisfy this tongue of mine, so...

938
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,120
It seems we took our imagination a bit too far.

939
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,220
No. We can't be too sure yet.

940
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:44,420
Well, how did you like the last supper that I prepared for you?

941
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:47,120
So, here it comes.

942
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,620
I guess it's time for me to talk.

943
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:53,320
Let me explain why I chose this place which I dished out a lot for,

944
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,920
as the stage for this game.

945
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,420
First, take a good look

946
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:02,620
at the many dishes that are in front of you.

947
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:05,520
A bird.

948
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,920
There is a mark of an eerie bird with a large beak.

949
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,220
Isn't this a crow?

950
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:14,520
Then, this is probably...

951
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,620
Have you figured it out?

952
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:19,720
That's the millionaire who died a mysterious death

953
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,120
a half a century ago.

954
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:26,020
It's the crest of Renya Karasuma.

955
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:28,420
Renya Karasuma?

956
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:31,520
Not only the dishes

957
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,220
but also the doors, floors, railings,

958
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:37,420
the men of chess and the playing cards in the living room

959
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:41,220
were all specially ordered and made by his request.

960
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:43,220
In other words, this is a villa,

961
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,520
which had been built by Karasuma

962
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,620
or, rather, it used to be a villa.

963
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:53,220
40 years ago, a blood-chilling tragedy occurred here,

964
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:57,420
on that stormy night.

965
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:59,420
Being that you are all superb detectives,

966
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:01,220
you may have already noticed

967
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,520
the minute you set foot into this place,

968
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,720
the remains of the enormous amount of blood

969
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,520
that splattered and shed.

970
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,820
Yes, it was on a certain night 40 years ago,

971
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:18,020
when this place still retained its beauty.

972
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:21,520
The prominent figures of the financial world were invited here,

973
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,420
and a certain gathering was held.

974
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,420
He passed away at the age of 99.

975
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:30,620
It was entitled "Memorial for the late Renya Karasuma".

976
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,320
But, in actuality,

977
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,320
the gathering was an auction of the various artworks

978
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:37,420
that Karasuma had collected during his life time.

979
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:40,020
More than 300 items were auctioned.

980
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:43,920
And, it was scheduled for a period of three days.

981
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,220
On the 2nd night, that stormy night.

982
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:54,820
Two men who were drenched with rain came to this place.

983
00:55:54,820 --> 00:56:00,020
The two men were freezing and with trembling lips, remarked

984
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,720
that they had lost their way in the storm,

985
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,820
and they would like to spend the night until the storm subsided.

986
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:08,920
The host of the auction was hesitant about

987
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,820
letting the two stay over at first, but...

988
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,920
the man handed the host over a small parcel

989
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,420
saying that it was in exchange for letting them stay over.

990
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:18,420
The contents of the parcel

991
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,520
seemed to be something like a cigarette,

992
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:23,020
and the host smoked it just as he was told to.

993
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:25,620
Then, he gradually got merrier and merrier,

994
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:29,320
and let the two men inside.

995
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,720
The other guests who were watching

996
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,620
were urged by the two to smoke likewise,

997
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:38,420
and the whole place was covered with smoke.

998
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:41,620
Don't tell me that the parcel was...

999
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:43,220
Marijuana.

1000
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,520
The guests had enjoyed a merry, boisterous time for a while,

1001
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:52,020
but after a while, things began to change.

1002
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:56,120
A man screamed as if he had seen the devil,

1003
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,920
carried the item that he had bid for and now owned, and ran.

1004
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,120
A woman started crying as if asking someone for forgiveness

1005
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,920
until her tears dried out.

1006
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,820
Yet another man, delightedly poked his arm time and again

1007
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:13,520
with the pen that he was holding.

1008
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,720
The guests finally

1009
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,820
began to snatch the works of art from each other,

1010
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:19,120
and using auctioned items,

1011
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,320
such as long swords and jeweled daggers,

1012
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,920
started killing each other.

1013
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,520
The auction grounds

1014
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,720
had transformed into a scene of massacre and hell.

1015
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,320
The day after the hideous and nightmarish night,

1016
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,520
the two men had disappeared with the art work and all,

1017
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:39,720
leaving 8 dead and as many as over 10 people in a comma behind.

1018
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:45,920
But, why is such a serious crime not known to the public?

1019
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,620
Probably because among them,

1020
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:51,820
there was a powerful figure of the financial world,

1021
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:54,120
or maybe a member of the family.

1022
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,720
I see.

1023
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,220
If conditions were that no one could tell who killed who,

1024
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:00,820
those involved may have come to the conclusion...

1025
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:03,520
That it would've been better

1026
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:07,520
to keep the case under cover, rather than solving it.

1027
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,020
It was probably within

1028
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,520
the calculation of those men too, wasn't it?

1029
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:18,020
Well, this age old story sure does whet my appetite.

1030
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:21,520
So, now do you understand

1031
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:25,920
why I chose this place as the stage for the game?

1032
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,620
I would like all you detectives

1033
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:34,720
to re-enact the tragedy that occurred here 40 years ago.

1034
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:38,320
That ugly scene of people fighting over the treasure

1035
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:41,520
and killing each other.

1036
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,120
Really stupid.

1037
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,620
I figure it's too cruel to make you all

1038
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:47,620
just search blindly all through this building,

1039
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:51,320
so let me give you a hint.

1040
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,320
Hint?

1041
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:56,720
When the two travelers looked up at the sky,

1042
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,820
a devil descended near the palace.

1043
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:03,420
The king carries the treasure with him as he flees.

1044
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,720
The queen collects tears in the chalice

1045
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,320
and asks for forgiveness.

1046
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:15,120
The warrior falls dead by the sword stained with his own blood.

1047
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,320
That must be...

1048
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,820
Don't you think that these sentences are more than suited

1049
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,520
to describe the competition of intelligence,

1050
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:25,220
staking your lives that is about to be carried out here?

1051
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:26,620
Don't be ridiculous.

1052
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:28,420
To kill someone,

1053
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:30,420
you need to have someone who wants to kill you,

1054
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:32,820
as well as, the will to kill yourself.

1055
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:36,820
Of course, you do not have a choice and cannot have out of this game.

1056
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:38,620
Because you are all

1057
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:44,320
already under the magic spell that I have chanted.

1058
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:52,320
So when someone among you lets out a scream,

1059
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,620
that is the start of the game.

1060
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:57,820
Understand? The one who finds the treasure

1061
00:59:57,820 --> 00:59:59,920
must enter the location of the treasure

1062
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,720
in the computer that is in the room

1063
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:04,320
on the fourth floor in the center tower.

1064
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:07,320
I will give you half the treasure as promised,

1065
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:11,620
as well as instructions on how to get out of here.

1066
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:15,920
Mr. Mogi.

1067
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,020
Mr. Mogi, are you all right?

1068
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,520
Just kidding.

1069
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:29,220
What a bad old man you are, really.

1070
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:30,620
Sorry, sorry.

1071
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:32,920
In token of my apology, I'm out.

1072
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,820
I'm not at all interested in treasure hunting.

1073
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:37,620
But, how do you intend to get out of here?

1074
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:39,920
Don't worry.

1075
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,020
This is not some isolated island in the middle of the ocean.

1076
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:46,520
I'll get somewhere if I keep roaming the mountains.

1077
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:49,620
See you all then, detectives!

1078
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,120
Hey, mister, it won't work twice.

1079
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:18,020
22:34 and 51 seconds, verified breathing stopped.

1080
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:19,020
Judging from the circumstances here,

1081
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:21,120
I think it is impossible to try to resuscitate him.

1082
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,720
What?

1083
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:27,620
No sign of cyanosis, in which the lips turn purple is seen.

1084
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:31,120
And besides, this almond odor distinct of hydro cyanic acid gas.

1085
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,620
Which means cyanide was in the tea that he just drank...

1086
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:39,020
Nope, there is no redox reaction.

1087
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:42,320
I guess it's not the tea.

1088
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,720
Then, what on earth happened to him?

1089
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,520
So, the dice has been thrown.

1090
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,620
For the sake of Detective Ogami who has died

1091
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:51,020
to make way for the grand start

1092
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:52,720
of this life risking competition of intelligence,

1093
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,220
go search for the treasure with all your might...

1094
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:59,420
Cut out your stupid talk!

1095
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:01,720
While you are still alive.

1096
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:05,020
A cassette tape.

1097
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:07,520
It seems to be connected to a timer.

1098
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,320
A timer?

1099
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:13,520
Were you also instructed on the time at which to bring the food in?

1100
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:18,420
Yes, in detail, appetizers, soup, main dish and dessert.

1101
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:25,120
Which means that he wasn't talking while watching us, but...

1102
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,920
The tape was being played.

1103
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,320
So, now we know two things.

1104
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:34,120
That the killer intended to kill Mr. Ogami to begin with.

1105
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:39,620
And, that maybe, the killer is among us.

1106
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:50,050
The killer may be among us?

1107
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:52,150
Take that tape for instance.

1108
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:54,850
Somebody in this room could've recorded the voice beforehand,

1109
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:59,550
and pretended listening to it, like everyone else here, right?

1110
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:03,450
That is possible.

1111
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:06,150
And sit in this same dining room as Mr. Ogami,

1112
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:08,750
without us noticing.

1113
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:10,850
He was made to drink the cyanide

1114
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:12,450
and poisoned him to death.

1115
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:16,550
Yeah, right in front of the very eyes of all 5 of us.

1116
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:19,950
Moreover, from the contents of the tape,

1117
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:22,150
it sure sounds like the killer

1118
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:25,350
knew what time the victim was going to die too.

1119
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:26,350
The question is,

1120
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:30,050
there was no cyanide compound reaction from the tea

1121
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:33,250
that he was drinking until just before he died.

1122
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:36,850
Then, maybe the poison was on the rim of the cup

1123
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:39,050
and not in the tea itself.

1124
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:44,950
No, because he drank from the cup two to three times.

1125
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:47,750
But, the criminal that you're referring to is,

1126
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:49,950
the Thief Kid, right?

1127
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:54,050
I've heard that he never kills anyone.

1128
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:56,950
No, this is the first case that something like this has happened,

1129
01:03:56,950 --> 01:03:58,350
as far as I know.

1130
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:01,050
Well, talking is not going to get us anywhere.

1131
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:03,150
Shouldn't we go take a look?

1132
01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:06,250
Whether our cars have really been blown up or not.

1133
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,350
I agree.

1134
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:13,050
There could be a car that was spared being blown up.

1135
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:16,750
Yeah. The explosion that we heard a while ago

1136
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:20,050
could've been a bluff.

1137
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:32,550
Ouch!

1138
01:04:33,850 --> 01:04:35,950
The car that I rented.

1139
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:40,150
My Ferarri's done medium to.

1140
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:44,250
My Alfa as well as Ogami's Porsche are all gone.

1141
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:47,350
Is that Bentz yours, then?

1142
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:52,250
No. I had my granny drive me over here.

1143
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:57,250
Strange. I had Mr. Mouri give me a lift here.

1144
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:59,350
Who's Bentz is that, then?

1145
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:03,350
I think it's the master's car.

1146
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:06,650
When I got here early this morning,

1147
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:08,850
it was already here.

1148
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:09,850
Which means that

1149
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:14,350
there is someone else besides us, here, after all?

1150
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:16,850
Could it mean that my car that is on the other side,

1151
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:19,350
has also been burned?

1152
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:23,650
On the other side? You mean you didn't park your car here?

1153
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:28,450
No, because I was instructed to park it at the back gate.

1154
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:32,250
What's the shortcut to the back gate?

1155
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:34,650
Go through the enclosed garden.

1156
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:43,650
Go to the back gate from the kitchen to the left beyond!

1157
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:50,250
Oh, your car's just fine!

1158
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:53,750
Isn't there something fishy about this car?

1159
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:56,950
The rat probably forget to set the bomb.

1160
01:05:56,950 --> 01:05:59,750
Then, maybe we should go check to see

1161
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:01,550
if the bridge is really gone.

1162
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:04,650
-I'll go with you. -I guess I will too.

1163
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:06,250
Me too.

1164
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:09,450
Come now, too many captains will sink the ship.

1165
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:12,650
True. We'll end up not the "Phantom Thief"

1166
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:15,150
but rather, a "Phantom Ship."

1167
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:17,450
Then, why not decides which detective goes,

1168
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:19,050
by tossing a coin?

1169
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:21,850
I just happen to have exactly 5 coins on me.

1170
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:30,350
My, you're pretty well prepared, little one.

1171
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:33,550
This is a very primitive way to decide, however.

1172
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:36,050
I guess we've got no choice.

1173
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:39,650
Then, the one who gets heads...

1174
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:42,850
Get to go drive over to the bridge and check it out.

1175
01:06:52,850 --> 01:06:57,650
The ones who are going are me, Mr. Mouri and Mogi, right?

1176
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:09,050
Please be careful, dad!

1177
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:20,950
Don't tell me that...

1178
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:23,450
It couldn't be...

1179
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:28,450
Come, let's go back inside.

1180
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:30,050
Come on, let's go!

1181
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:31,850
Oh, okay.

1182
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:38,950
What a sight.

1183
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:41,850
The bridge is completely downed.

1184
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:44,150
Hey, Granny Senma!

1185
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:45,950
Will you bring the headlights up closer?

1186
01:07:45,950 --> 01:07:48,050
I want to look at my feet.

1187
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:54,050
Okay! Uh... closer...

1188
01:07:56,850 --> 01:07:59,350
I wonder if the killer will move.

1189
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:02,250
Yeah. I don't think this is all there is to it.

1190
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,700
Sen...

1191
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,400
Ms. Senma!

1192
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:21,300
Ms. Senma!

1193
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:39,750
What? Senma died?

1194
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:41,950
Yeah, it was rigged

1195
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:43,350
so that when you touch the lights of the car,

1196
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:45,150
it would explode.

1197
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:46,350
Oh, no.

1198
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:49,050
Waiting here is just going to get us killed.

1199
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:51,950
Let's split up and go check

1200
01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:53,850
if there is really someone else in this house!

1201
01:08:53,850 --> 01:08:58,450
Then maybe we three women should form a group.

1202
01:08:58,450 --> 01:09:00,850
That way we can even go to the restroom together.

1203
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:02,950
Hey. By the way,

1204
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:05,350
where did that brown haired, fair skinned young man go?

1205
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:07,850
Beats me. Maybe he's feeding the eagle

1206
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:10,150
that he brought along with him?

1207
01:09:26,850 --> 01:09:30,050
Oh. What a fancy thing to find here.

1208
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:36,650
There is a brand new scratch on the piano cord.

1209
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:39,950
That was probably made by the claws of the eagle.

1210
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:45,250
It shows that the young man also came and searched this room.

1211
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:49,850
Huh? There is something stuck between the keys of the piano!

1212
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:57,650
This is the secret code that indicates

1213
01:09:57,650 --> 01:10:00,050
the location of the treasure that he was talking about?

1214
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:06,350
But why is it mimeographed on rice paper?

1215
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:09,650
Somebody probably printed a whole lot of this

1216
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:12,250
when no such things as copy machines existed yet.

1217
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:15,950
And, for some reason, distributed it to many people.

1218
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:18,450
In other words, the thing he was referring to...

1219
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:21,950
The story about the tragedy that occurred here 40 years ago

1220
01:10:21,950 --> 01:10:26,850
as well as the secret code indicating the hidden treasure,

1221
01:10:26,850 --> 01:10:29,850
are all a bunch of baloney.

1222
01:10:34,050 --> 01:10:37,450
Huh? This piano is leaking.

1223
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:40,250
Come to think of it, yes, it is.

1224
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:44,850
This is that young lady's luminol fluid.

1225
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:47,850
Which means that she's been in this room too.

1226
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:50,850
Hey, flimsy mustache, turn off the light!

1227
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:51,850
Quick!

1228
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:54,450
What the...

1229
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:18,150
Huh? Where is Aki, the maid?

1230
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:21,350
She said she'd be waiting in the corridor outside the restroom,

1231
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:22,650
but you go check?

1232
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:24,450
Oh, okay.

1233
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:28,250
Aki.

1234
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:31,250
Aki.

1235
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:46,150
There are letters written in blood on the piano.

1236
01:11:46,150 --> 01:11:51,250
Something did happen after all, 40 years ago.

1237
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:53,450
An ace...

1238
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:54,950
Don't tell me that...

1239
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:11,850
Just as I thought, it was you, after all.

1240
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:15,250
The killer would never risk danger,

1241
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:19,050
such as to ride a car that has been rigged with a bomb.

1242
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:22,350
In other words, the possible killers are those who stayed behind.

1243
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:24,150
You and me.

1244
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:27,750
Ran and the maid, Aki.

1245
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:32,450
Oh, my, sonny, that stuff can be dangerous.

1246
01:12:32,450 --> 01:12:36,550
It was under the pillow in my room.

1247
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:37,750
Although you probably put it there

1248
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:41,450
so that you could set me up as the killer later.

1249
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:43,950
Oh, what a coincidence.

1250
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:46,450
I was thinking exactly the same thing.

1251
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:49,850
I made the exact same deduction as you.

1252
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:56,050
Gun fire?

1253
01:12:56,050 --> 01:12:57,950
It came from the center tower!

1254
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:12,350
No good, the bullet's gone right through his chest.

1255
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:13,950
Darn.

1256
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:16,150
The stairs?

1257
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:18,750
Somebody's using the stairs!

1258
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:23,350
Why, you...

1259
01:13:28,850 --> 01:13:30,850
A computer?

1260
01:13:30,850 --> 01:13:35,950
He said to come here after we find where the treasure is.

1261
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:39,650
So... Ms. Souda?

1262
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:41,250
Take a look.

1263
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:44,250
If I turn the knob that is on the inside,

1264
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:46,550
a needle is set up to come out.

1265
01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:50,750
When the one who finds the treasure

1266
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:52,450
inputs the location into the computer

1267
01:13:52,450 --> 01:13:56,050
and is ready to leave the room, that person is poisoned to death.

1268
01:13:56,050 --> 01:13:57,150
But...

1269
01:13:57,150 --> 01:13:59,350
where on earth is the killer?

1270
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:03,150
Don't you play dumb with me.

1271
01:14:05,450 --> 01:14:06,850
This woman

1272
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:10,050
couldn't have got done with by a trap she set up herself,

1273
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:11,850
and the maid and your daughter

1274
01:14:11,850 --> 01:14:14,050
are snoozing away in the toilet.

1275
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:17,950
If that gunshot was a fake,

1276
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:21,750
the only two people who can commit murder are you and me.

1277
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:23,850
I know it's not me, so it means that...

1278
01:14:28,050 --> 01:14:30,350
You're the one, right?

1279
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,740
Punish the suspicious.

1280
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:46,840
No offense.

1281
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:51,240
Mr. Sleeping Kogoro.

1282
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,840
This can't be happening.

1283
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:19,540
Even gathering the detectives

1284
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:22,240
did not result in a solution after all.

1285
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:27,740
Cut off? The picture of the hidden camera.

1286
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:30,240
What?

1287
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:33,840
Somebody is inputting data?

1288
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,640
Who on earth could it be?

1289
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:43,140
What?

1290
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:46,240
The code of the room has been deciphered.

1291
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:48,240
I'd like to verbally say it directly to you,

1292
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:50,340
so come to the dining room.

1293
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:52,440
The 7th detective!

1294
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,440
It can't be!

1295
01:15:58,240 --> 01:15:59,240
It can't be!

1296
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:01,640
All the detectives that I invited should all be dead!

1297
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,940
There is no such thing as a 7th detective!

1298
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:07,640
Then, who can it be? Who on earth...

1299
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:16,540
It is difficult to think that

1300
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:19,640
the person who set a bomb to the car ride the car

1301
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,640
unless it was a suicidal plan.

1302
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:23,340
However, there are exceptions.

1303
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:28,340
That is, in the case you want to make it look like you,

1304
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:30,040
yourself died in the explosion.

1305
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:33,340
Right?

1306
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,440
Detective Senma.

1307
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:41,540
Yes. Before the explosion,

1308
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:43,640
you snuck out of the car,

1309
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:46,940
hid in the bushes, and confirmed the car falling over.

1310
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:49,740
After sneaking back here,

1311
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:53,340
you were watching all of us from a room somewhere in here

1312
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:56,540
through all the hidden cameras.

1313
01:16:56,540 --> 01:16:57,640
Don't be ridiculous.

1314
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:59,240
I got out of the car in the nick of time

1315
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,440
after I realized the car was going to explode.

1316
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:06,040
I just got back here.

1317
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:07,940
Besides, didn't we decide at that time

1318
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:12,240
who was going to ride the car by tossing coins?

1319
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:13,540
Not really. It was already decided that

1320
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:16,440
you were going to ride the car even before the coins were tossed.

1321
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:19,040
You set the coin with the head facing up on the back of your hand

1322
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,440
even before you tossed the coin.

1323
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,840
You covered your right hand over your left hand

1324
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,240
from above the coin that you were holding,

1325
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:28,540
and pretended to catch the coin that you flicked.

1326
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:30,140
You dropped that coin on the ground,

1327
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:32,740
and show the first coin you put on the back of your hand.

1328
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:35,440
No matter how many times you repeat it, you get heads!

1329
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,540
Since you had a 10 yen coin on you,

1330
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:41,240
when checking the tea that Mr. Ogami was drinking,

1331
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,440
so it would've been able to carry this out, wouldn't you?

1332
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,440
"The God Forsaken Child"!

1333
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:49,440
Oh. Are you saying that the host who carried out the supper

1334
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,440
and killed Mr. Ogami is me?

1335
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:54,240
Then, tell me.

1336
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:59,140
How did I make only Mr. Ogami take the cyanide in this dining room,

1337
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:04,040
and just how I was able to predict the time?

1338
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,940
There was no poison in his tea,

1339
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:11,040
Mr. Mouri was sitting in between Mr. Ogami and me.

1340
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,240
Besides, didn't we play stone, paper, scissors

1341
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:16,140
to decide where to sit?

1342
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:18,640
The seating has nothing to do with it.

1343
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,640
Because you had swabbed

1344
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:24,640
everybody's cup with cyanide beforehand anyway.

1345
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,640
You swabbed the cyanide in the upper part

1346
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:29,140
where the handle joins the cup.

1347
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:32,040
That is the place where Mr. Ogami's right thumb tip touches

1348
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,740
when he holds his tea cup.

1349
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:36,540
It is also very close to his nails

1350
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:39,240
that he unconsciously bites when he thinks.

1351
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,740
He started biting his nails

1352
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:42,940
right after the tape recording of you changed voice

1353
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:46,640
announced the code to the hiding place of the treasure.

1354
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:47,940
If you gave instructions to the maid

1355
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:51,240
to serve the tea a little before the tape was to be played.

1356
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:54,840
Mr. Ogami, after hearing about the code, would start thinking

1357
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:58,040
and you would be able to kill him alone just as scheduled.

1358
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:02,340
But, back then, I remember that everyone wiped their dishes

1359
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:05,340
before using them, just to be safe.

1360
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:06,840
True.

1361
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:11,940
It was too careless for a renowned detective, such as Mr. Ogami.

1362
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:16,840
Unless, he was your partner all along.

1363
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:19,340
Being so sure that nothing could ever happen to him,

1364
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:21,940
he skipped the safety precautions that everyone else took.

1365
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:25,940
From the time I heard that when Aki arrived early in the morning,

1366
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:31,240
the Bentz was already parked, I was suspicious of you.

1367
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:33,140
In order for anyone to abandon a Bentz

1368
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:35,140
in such an remote mountain area,

1369
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:37,640
there had to be someone to ride the Bentz,

1370
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:40,140
as well as, somebody else to come pick you up.

1371
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:42,640
You would need an accomplice.

1372
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:46,140
While I'm at it, the reason why you went out of your way

1373
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:48,940
to wait for Mr. Mouri, and make him give you a lift

1374
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:51,440
was to leave an impression on him, that you don't like cigarettes.

1375
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,440
In order to work it out

1376
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:55,440
so that only Mr. Ogami dies in the dining room.

1377
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:57,340
If Mr. Ogami were to put a cigarette in his mouth

1378
01:19:57,340 --> 01:20:00,140
after grabbing a cyanide coated cigarette with his fingertips...

1379
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,840
He would immediately go to the world beyond.

1380
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,240
The reason why you chose Aki to be your maid is because

1381
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,340
you found out that she has a habit of biting her fingernails

1382
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:10,040
by watching her through the hidden camera during the interview,

1383
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:11,540
and you figured that you could kill her using the same method

1384
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:13,840
that you used to kill Mr. Ogami at any time.

1385
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:17,540
Yes, you killed Mr. Ogami who was your accomplice,

1386
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:20,940
made yourself look as if you'd been killed by someone,

1387
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:22,340
psychologically cornered all the detectives

1388
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:26,540
that you've invited here into deciphering the code,

1389
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:28,440
and once you found the treasure,

1390
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,640
you were going to massacre everyone here.

1391
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:35,640
Just like Renya Karasuma did 40 years ago!

1392
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:38,740
I found the name "Kyosuke Senma" at the end of the words

1393
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:41,240
written in blood on the piano.

1394
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:42,840
That was probably...

1395
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,540
That's my father's name.

1396
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:49,340
My father who was an archaeologist

1397
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:52,640
was invited to this Twilight Inn 40 years ago.

1398
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,940
The story was that a millionaire who was over 100 years of age,

1399
01:20:54,940 --> 01:20:56,840
inherited estate from his mother

1400
01:20:56,840 --> 01:21:00,340
and found out that there was hidden treasure in the building.

1401
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:03,840
He wanted someone to find the treasure for him

1402
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:07,140
before his time to die.

1403
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:09,640
It seemed to be an easy job that paid well,

1404
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:13,440
and cash was sent to us everyday with a letter,

1405
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:16,040
so my mother and I were delighted.

1406
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:19,140
But, 6 months later, the letters and cash suddenly stopped coming,

1407
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:21,140
and my father who did not tell us where he was going

1408
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:23,340
could not be contacted since then.

1409
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:25,640
We found out the truth,

1410
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:28,940
only after we raised the last letter we got

1411
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:31,940
from my father up to the light.

1412
01:21:32,740 --> 01:21:35,640
It was a letter that my father had written by opening holes

1413
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:38,140
using a needle.

1414
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:40,640
The letter was about a code that indicated the location

1415
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,140
of the hidden treasure,

1416
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:43,440
that there were many other scientists

1417
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,740
other than my father who had been summoned to the place.

1418
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:49,640
And that Karasuma, who was almost at the end of his time,

1419
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:52,040
became impatient and started killing the scientists

1420
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:53,540
as an example of what would happen

1421
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:56,440
if they didn't hurry and find the treasure.

1422
01:21:57,340 --> 01:21:59,040
My father had also written that even if the treasure were to be found,

1423
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,840
he would not be able to make it out alive.

1424
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,940
Did you tell the police about this?

1425
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:06,440
No. I only found out about the letter

1426
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:10,040
written with a needle 20 years later.

1427
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:12,640
And, besides, Renya had already passed away,

1428
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:15,440
and the building was handed over to someone else.

1429
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:18,040
But, it all started when I happened

1430
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:21,940
to talk about this to Ogami 2 years ago.

1431
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:25,140
He went all out and found this place

1432
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:28,840
and started like mad to look for the treasure.

1433
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:31,940
However, he couldn't decipher the code.

1434
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:35,340
He bought this place and had a large debt because of it.

1435
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:37,540
So, unable to reverse what had already been done,

1436
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:39,840
he said the following.

1437
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,540
Let's gather all the well-known detectives here and have them decipher the code!

1438
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:45,940
The bait to get all the detectives to come, is the Thief Kid!

1439
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:48,340
We'll set him up as the host, and set up a game

1440
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:50,840
in which everyone would have to stake their lives on!

1441
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,340
By making it look as though both you and me

1442
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:55,040
have been killed part way through the game.

1443
01:22:57,140 --> 01:23:00,340
Right! Maybe we should actually kill the maid?

1444
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:02,740
Once they find out that they really have to be risking their lives,

1445
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:05,140
they have no choice but to get serious!

1446
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:09,340
No problem, we'll just put all the blame on the Thief Kid.

1447
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:12,240
Which means the one who chose that maid was...

1448
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:13,940
Mr. Ogami.

1449
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:16,340
He was delighted saying that he found a maid

1450
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:19,340
with a habit just like his, that he could kill.

1451
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:24,440
I guess he never thought that he'd be killed in the same way.

1452
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:27,840
Yes, he bit his nails at that time,

1453
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:31,540
because I had recorded something he had not expected to hear.

1454
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:36,740
Because he was thinking of killing the maid after the dinner.

1455
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:38,940
But, why did you kill Mr. Ogami?

1456
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:40,840
Because I realized that

1457
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:42,740
he had found the location of the hidden treasure,

1458
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:46,540
and was planning to kill everyone, including me.

1459
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:49,040
By making it look like we all killed each other using the gun

1460
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:51,740
that he had set up in all of our rooms.

1461
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:54,940
If I were to stop Ogami, who was obsessed by Karasuma,

1462
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:58,440
as well as let the detectives continue to decipher the code.

1463
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:01,140
I had no other choice but to carry things out the way I did.

1464
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:03,640
The result ended up the same as 40 years ago.

1465
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:08,140
The code could not be deciphered, and the tragedy was repeated.

1466
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:12,640
I think your father did decipher the code, don't you?

1467
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:13,940
Huh?

1468
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:15,440
Don't you think it's strange that

1469
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,340
there is only one clock in this large building,

1470
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:20,040
the one in the dining room. Why?

1471
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:22,040
Yes. The sentence at the top of the code,

1472
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:25,440
"When the two travelers looked up at the sky" means

1473
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,740
when the long hand and the short hand of the clock

1474
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:29,340
point to the same direction at the top, 00:00!

1475
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:33,440
So, let's do that by making the hands of the clock point at 00:00.

1476
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:36,140
And the key to solving the rest of the code

1477
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:38,240
is what your father had left behind by writing in blood,

1478
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:39,340
"the final ace"!

1479
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:42,440
This refers to playing cards in English.

1480
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:45,740
The King, Queen and Jack in the code,

1481
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:49,240
are the King, Queen and Jack of the playing cards.

1482
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:53,040
The treasure is diamond, the chalice is heart

1483
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,940
and the dagger is spade.

1484
01:24:55,940 --> 01:24:56,940
In other words,

1485
01:24:56,940 --> 01:24:59,440
the treasure and the King is the king of diamonds.

1486
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:02,140
The chalice and the Queen is the queen of hearts.

1487
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:06,340
The dagger and the warrior is the jack of spades.

1488
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:09,140
Then you move the hands of the clock

1489
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:13,640
in accordance to the direction their faces are turned.

1490
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:15,540
Left 13.

1491
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:17,740
Left 12.

1492
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:20,440
Right 11, then.

1493
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:31,340
The polish has rubbed off,

1494
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:33,640
and gold is in view on the inside.

1495
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:36,240
Moreover, this clock is heavier than it looks.

1496
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:39,940
I see. The inside of this clock is pure gold.

1497
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:41,840
Well, well...

1498
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:46,040
to think that my father had to die for something like that.

1499
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:49,440
I guess that's life.

1500
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,840
So, you promised, Ms. Senma.

1501
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:54,940
Tell me the way out of this place!

1502
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:57,640
There is no way out of here to begin with.

1503
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:01,140
I was planning to bury my bones here.

1504
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:04,140
Although Mr. Ogami did believe me

1505
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:07,740
when I told him that I would tell him the way after dinner.

1506
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:09,940
Just as I thought.

1507
01:26:09,940 --> 01:26:11,540
Granny Senma.

1508
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:14,440
What're you going to do about the only valuable I had on me?

1509
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:16,040
Remember, I told you

1510
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:18,640
that something childish like this isn't worth it.

1511
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:22,340
Oh? Complain to sonny over there if you got any gripes.

1512
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:24,540
He's the one who said that she may tell us the way out,

1513
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:28,240
if a child asked to know.

1514
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:30,240
You mean you all pretended to be dead,

1515
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:32,640
just so that I would tell you the way out?

1516
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:35,140
Yeah. Because you were even trying to kill

1517
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:37,140
the ones who figured the code out.

1518
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:39,740
We figured that you wouldn't tell us even if we cornered you,

1519
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:42,040
so long as we were alive.

1520
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:46,940
Besides, through the monitor, even ketchup looks like blood.

1521
01:26:46,940 --> 01:26:48,540
But, at least...

1522
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:51,640
we did right in putting Ran and Aki to sleep.

1523
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,340
This act of bad taste

1524
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:56,340
would have been too harsh on the hearts of young women.

1525
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:00,540
Since when did you know I was the killer?

1526
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:04,640
From the time, that boy over there made I toss the coin.

1527
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:05,840
Back then,

1528
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,640
you stretched your hand all the way over to take the coin

1529
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:09,340
that was farthest away from you, right?

1530
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:11,440
That's when it flashed through me.

1531
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:15,040
That you didn't want anyone else to take the 10 yen coin.

1532
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:18,340
If anyone with cyanide on their hands touch the 10 yen coin,

1533
01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:20,040
redox reaction would occur,

1534
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:22,140
and the whole trick would be disclosed!

1535
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:25,340
That's why we all took you to be the killer,

1536
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:27,540
and joined hands right off the bat.

1537
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:30,940
I had seen through the trick as soon as I saw

1538
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:33,240
Mr. Ogami's nail of his right thumb.

1539
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:34,840
You little brat.

1540
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:39,440
So, the problem is how do we make it out of here?

1541
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:41,340
My, what's that sound?

1542
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:44,440
Oh, probably the police choppers that I contacted.

1543
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:45,840
You called them?

1544
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:48,640
Watson probably took the letter that I had attached to his anklet

1545
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:50,940
to nanny who was waiting in the car below the cliff,

1546
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:53,440
as soon as morning came!

1547
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,740
I'm glad that I marked the car with an X

1548
01:27:55,740 --> 01:27:57,940
so that he'd be able to tell it apart from other cars.

1549
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:00,240
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

1550
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,340
Talk about having to put on such a crumby act.

1551
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:05,340
No, that's not only the sound of choppers.

1552
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:08,740
I hear the sound of something collapsing too.

1553
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:10,240
Don't tell me that...

1554
01:28:16,010 --> 01:28:19,210
So, the Thief Kid never showed up, huh?

1555
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:21,010
Did you want him to?

1556
01:28:21,010 --> 01:28:22,210
Oh, not really.

1557
01:28:22,210 --> 01:28:23,810
But, granny.

1558
01:28:23,810 --> 01:28:26,010
The thing about psychologically cornering us

1559
01:28:26,010 --> 01:28:28,510
was Ogami's idea, wasn't it?

1560
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:32,210
Why did you pretend to be dead after you killed him?

1561
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:34,610
I wanted the code that my father left behind

1562
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:37,710
to be deciphered no matter what the risk.

1563
01:28:37,710 --> 01:28:40,010
I wanted to find out in this life time.

1564
01:28:40,010 --> 01:28:43,610
I didn't think I could ever have such renowned detectives like you

1565
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:46,410
gather together like this, ever again.

1566
01:28:46,410 --> 01:28:52,410
Maybe it was I, who was obsessed by Renya Karasuma.

1567
01:28:55,910 --> 01:28:56,910
Granny?

1568
01:28:56,910 --> 01:28:58,210
What the...

1569
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:01,410
Shoots!

1570
01:29:01,410 --> 01:29:03,410
Dad!

1571
01:29:10,610 --> 01:29:12,110
Thief Kid?

1572
01:29:12,110 --> 01:29:13,210
Hey, granny!

1573
01:29:13,210 --> 01:29:16,610
I think you're already too old to rush to your death, huh?

1574
01:29:16,610 --> 01:29:18,310
Don't be ridiculous!

1575
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:21,110
I saved you.

1576
01:29:21,110 --> 01:29:25,610
As an apology for using your name to hold the supper.

1577
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:27,210
You would've never been able to escape

1578
01:29:27,210 --> 01:29:30,510
the grasp of those two boys unless I did it this way.

1579
01:29:30,510 --> 01:29:33,110
Especially from the little one that was aiming

1580
01:29:33,110 --> 01:29:35,310
a strange looking watch at you.

1581
01:29:35,310 --> 01:29:37,510
Oh, so you knew.

1582
01:29:37,510 --> 01:29:41,510
Cigarette. Kogoro Mouri is a heavy smoker.

1583
01:29:41,510 --> 01:29:45,310
You didn't smoke one cigarette since arriving at the inn, right?

1584
01:29:45,310 --> 01:29:48,610
Who are they, anyway?

1585
01:29:48,610 --> 01:29:53,310
Lovers that I most definitely do not want to encounter, I guess?

1586
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:55,310
How unfortunate.

1587
01:29:55,310 --> 01:29:58,810
You came because you were after Karasuma's treasure, didn't you?

1588
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:01,310
Yeah, at first maybe, but I guess not, after all.

1589
01:30:02,710 --> 01:30:06,410
It won't fit into the cloth I carry my stolen goods in.

1590
01:30:12,410 --> 01:30:14,810
The walls have collapsed and gold is showing from inside.

1591
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:18,710
That clock was the switch to bring the walls down.

1592
01:30:18,710 --> 01:30:21,210
Just a would be expected of a residence owned by Karasuma.

1593
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:23,310
It's worth at least zillions.

1594
01:30:23,310 --> 01:30:24,710
I see.

1595
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:28,810
Twilight means the time when the sky glitters yellow at sunset.

1596
01:30:28,810 --> 01:30:31,910
It is indeed the Twilight Inn.

1597
01:31:56,510 --> 01:32:00,310
Where is my real dad?

1598
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:01,310
Huh?

1599
01:32:08,710 --> 01:32:09,910
Over here.
