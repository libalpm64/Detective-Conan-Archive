1
00:00:08,796 --> 00:00:11,396
Oh, it stopped raining.

2
00:00:11,396 --> 00:00:13,696
Yeah.

3
00:00:13,696 --> 00:00:17,096
That's Orion Planning where Mr. Higashiyama

4
00:00:17,096 --> 00:00:18,896
that we're going to be meeting now is working.

5
00:00:18,896 --> 00:00:22,796
What does the company Orion Planning do?

6
00:00:22,796 --> 00:00:26,796
They do commercials, plan events and produce TV programs.

7
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,796
It seems that the Kamen Yaiba show that kids love

8
00:00:32,796 --> 00:00:34,996
is also what this company handles.

9
00:00:34,996 --> 00:00:37,396
I went to watch it last week too

10
00:00:37,396 --> 00:00:40,019
because Genta and the others wanted to go.

11
00:00:58,896 --> 00:01:00,696
Brooding over passing seasons

12
00:01:00,696 --> 00:01:02,496
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

13
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:04,043
Someone falls to death in front of your eyes.

14
00:01:04,296 --> 00:01:06,496
The mystery of an alibi with a blind spot.

15
00:01:06,496 --> 00:01:08,047
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:10,049
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,051
His name is Detective Conan!

18
00:02:36,327 --> 00:02:42,141
"Alibi of a Fall"

19
00:02:47,427 --> 00:02:50,727
We have an appointment with

20
00:02:50,727 --> 00:02:53,427
Mr. Higashiyama of the publishing planning division.

21
00:02:53,427 --> 00:02:55,027
You're Mr. Mouri.

22
00:02:55,027 --> 00:02:57,127
I've heard of you from Mr. Higashiyama.

23
00:02:57,127 --> 00:02:59,127
I'll put him through on the extension right now.

24
00:02:59,127 --> 00:03:00,159
Mr. Higashiyama told me

25
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,827
to call him on the extension phone from here.

26
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:06,527
It's extension 423, isn't it?

27
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:08,167
Yes, that's right.

28
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:10,169
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:18,827
Uh... 4, 2, 3.

30
00:03:23,027 --> 00:03:25,127
Yes, hello.

31
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:28,187
Mr. Higashiyama? Mouri here.

32
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:29,727
Mr. Mouri!

33
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:32,727
Thank you for coming at this hour of the day.

34
00:03:32,727 --> 00:03:35,527
Don't worry about it!

35
00:03:35,527 --> 00:03:37,127
I'll come for you right away.

36
00:03:37,127 --> 00:03:40,927
My office is located in an annex behind that office, you see.

37
00:03:43,527 --> 00:03:44,727
What?

38
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:46,727
What's the matter, Mr. Mouri?

39
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:51,527
Well... A person just went falling outside the window.

40
00:03:51,527 --> 00:03:53,327
What was that?

41
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,060
The person who died was the event planner

42
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,860
who works here named Mr. Fujihiko Takahata.

43
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,560
He fell to his death.

44
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,235
It seems that Mr. Takahata's office

45
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:18,237
is right above here on the 6th floor,

46
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:21,660
and he most likely fell from that window.

47
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,260
I see.

48
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,245
And, what brings you here?

49
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:29,560
I was asked to come here by Mr. Higashiyama who works here.

50
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,660
Yes, that's right.

51
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,160
I wanted to hear what Mr. Mouri had to say about

52
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,257
a book on mystery quizzes that I'm planning to publish.

53
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,259
The only two that are left in the company tonight

54
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,263
seem to be Mr. Higashiyama and Ms. Sunakawa.

55
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,960
I guess we should start by going to look at

56
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,460
Mr. Takahata's office on the 6th floor.

57
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,560
Yes, sir.

58
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,560
The back of the corpse is wet,

59
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,560
despite the rain having stopped. Why?

60
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:09,660
The elevator... Are you checking it?

61
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,560
No, we've already finished so you can use it.

62
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,360
-Did anything happen? -Yes, sort of.

63
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,299
We may have to ask you some questions later,

64
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:22,560
so please wait around, all right?

65
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,760
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

66
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,860
Mr. Takahata's office is the one at the very end?

67
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,160
Yes, sir.

68
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,660
You sure perspire a lot, don't you?

69
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,860
You're soaked with sweat

70
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,060
all the way to the collar of your dress shirt.

71
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,260
What? Is that so?

72
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,327
There's a band aid wrapped around Ms. Sunakawa's finger.

73
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:51,160
She didn't have it when we got here.

74
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,060
I wonder when she got hurt?

75
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,760
It's locked.

76
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,860
If his office is locked, it could mean that

77
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,360
it's highly probable that he committed suicide.

78
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,260
Suicide?

79
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,860
Mr. Takahata? No way!

80
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,560
What do you mean?

81
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,660
It's hard to believe that a person as arrogant

82
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,660
and overly confident like him would commit suicide.

83
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:29,760
There seems to be no mistake that he fell from here.

84
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,160
Inspector, this...

85
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,360
What's that?

86
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,460
"My talent has reached its limits."

87
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,375
"Embarrassing myself further is not something I want."

88
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,160
"I shall thus end my life. -Takahata Fujihiko" -This is...

89
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,360
Is it Mr. Takahata's will?

90
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,660
Oh no! I can't believe it!

91
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:46,385
Huh?

92
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:48,060
Conan!

93
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,360
Just what do you think you're doing?

94
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,360
It's wet over there!

95
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,391
What?

96
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,060
True.

97
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,360
When did tonight's rain stop?

98
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,399
If I remember correctly, it started raining at around 7:30

99
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,401
and stopped about 8:00.

100
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,160
We arrived at this building at around 8:20, right?

101
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,260
Yeah.

102
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,760
Hold it. Which means, that the window was left open

103
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,860
for more 20 minutes before Mr. Takahata fell from it?

104
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,419
Mr. Takahata's back was also wet, right?

105
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:22,960
I wonder if Mr. Takahata was standing by this open window

106
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,960
with his back against it way before he fell?

107
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,429
That's strange.

108
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:31,860
Inspector!

109
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,360
This was found stuck to Mr. Takahata's suit top!

110
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,160
What's that?

111
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,660
It looks familiar.

112
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,760
That's something that's used during the Kamen Yaiba Show.

113
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,460
Yes, that's right.

114
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,960
I think it's the scale that's on the monster suit.

115
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,160
Why would something like that be here?

116
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,260
The other day, I went to watch the Kamen Yaiba Show.

117
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,460
The Laser Police that's friends with Kamen Yaiba

118
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,960
fired his laser gun,

119
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,060
then the monster went "pssss" and deflated!

120
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,860
Huh, what's going on?

121
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,160
Hey! Just what do you think you're talking about?

122
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,469
Why? Why?

123
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:12,460
That monster is made of balloon.

124
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,660
The gun that the laser police has gives off infrared rays

125
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,960
just like that of a TV remote control

126
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,479
and when this hits the sensor of the monster,

127
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,860
it's made so that air escapes and the monster deflates.

128
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,485
That's something!

129
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:30,489
Air escapes from the balloon and it deflates?

130
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,160
Wait a minute.

131
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,360
The eaves is not wet.

132
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,260
Just as I thought.

133
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,760
What's the matter?

134
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,507
No... nothing!

135
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,511
Inspector! This is homicide made to look like suicide.

136
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:54,513
What?

137
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:57,260
First, he put the inflated monster balloon

138
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,260
on top of the eaves outside.

139
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,760
Then, Mr. Takahata who was put to sleep

140
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,960
with a sleeping drug or something,

141
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,560
was placed on the balloon by pushing him

142
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,960
forward out of the window.

143
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,460
Then, the culprit leaves the room!

144
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,360
But the door was locked from the inside, you know?

145
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,533
As for that,

146
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:17,060
if the window of the room next door is left open beforehand,

147
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,660
it's possible to move over using the window and get out!

148
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,960
I see.

149
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,460
And if he fires the gun at the monster from another room

150
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,360
using a remote controller,

151
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,547
Mr. Takahata's body bumps into the eaves and goes falling

152
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,060
without leaving any unexplained wounds on his body!

153
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,960
There were no traces of the eaves

154
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,555
under this window being wet by rain.

155
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:37,960
That's evidence that the monster balloon

156
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,559
was set in place before it rained!

157
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,460
I see. So, he retrieved the deflated balloon

158
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,860
by pulling on the rope or something

159
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,360
he had tied on to the balloon beforehand.

160
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,360
Wow, that's super deduction, Pops!

161
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,260
Of course it is!

162
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,160
The culprit after setting all this up left the room,

163
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,860
but it began to rain before he carried out his plan,

164
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,960
so the back of the corpse and floor got wet.

165
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,260
So, the culprit made this will up too!

166
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,860
Where is that balloon usually stored?

167
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,960
Inside the 1st floor warehouse.

168
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,360
All employees can access it at all times.

169
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,060
The culprit is an employee of this company.

170
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,060
Chiba! The monster balloon and gun that is moved by a remote controller

171
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,560
should be somewhere in this building.

172
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,060
Search every nook and cranny and find it!

173
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,360
Yes, sir!

174
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:30,060
How far does the infrared laser reach?

175
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,660
The farthest it goes at most is 56 meters.

176
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,615
Which means, it won't be difficult

177
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:38,617
to find which room the culprit used.

178
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:42,621
True. The conference room next door and...

179
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:45,360
The office rooms right below here on the 5th and 4th floor,

180
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,260
and the conference room next to those rooms.

181
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,629
A total of 5 rooms.

182
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,633
But only the user of those offices have the key,

183
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:57,760
so other people do not have free access to them.

184
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,060
In other words, it's any one of the conference rooms

185
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,760
on the 4th, 5th or 6th floor.

186
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,960
Are the conference rooms all made the same way?

187
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,460
Yes.

188
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,260
Inspector. If it's this distance,

189
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,260
it's possible to move from window to window.

190
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,160
Okay, Takagi. Go to the security guard room

191
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,659
and check who went in and out of here this evening.

192
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,661
Yes, sir.

193
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:26,665
I'd like to start by asking you some questions, then.

194
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,860
I was on the phone talking to a client in this office

195
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,760
on the 2nd floor right through from a little before it started raining.

196
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,460
By the time I finished talking on the phone,

197
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,960
the rain had stopped.

198
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,660
When did you hear that

199
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,560
I would coming here from Mr. Higashiyama?

200
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,260
About 7:00.

201
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,860
Before I received the call from my client,

202
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,360
I got a call on the extension phone from Mr. Higashiyama's office.

203
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,360
How did you know that it was from Mr. Higashiyama's office?

204
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,760
Because the extension number is displayed,

205
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,160
there's no mistake.

206
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,701
-Mr. Mouri and the others came after that. -Yes, sir.

207
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,705
While Mr. Mouri was talking on the extension phone with Mr. Higashiyama,

208
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:09,560
I went to the reference room to return some documents.

209
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,360
This way.

210
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,717
I was organizing some papers here,

211
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:20,460
so I didn't notice all the noise

212
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,260
Mr. Mouri and the others were making here.

213
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,060
Didn't you just make it look that way,

214
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,725
when you actually ran right away up to the 4th floor,

215
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:29,260
and pushed Mr. Takahata out the window from the conference room?

216
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,731
But the stairs is right beside the elevator,

217
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:35,360
so the maintenance men working on the elevator would've seen her.

218
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,160
True.

219
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,741
You were organizing some papers and?

220
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:44,743
I cut my finger with the paper,

221
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:47,960
so I went back to the office to get myself a band aid.

222
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,360
That's when I first noticed

223
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,160
the voices of Mr. Mouri and the others outside the window,

224
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,460
and tried to go outside, too.

225
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,260
Just then I saw Mr. Higashiyama

226
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,960
coming along from the connecting corridor.

227
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,060
Did you pick up the call on the extension phone

228
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,760
from Mr. Mouri in this room?

229
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,760
Yes. Since I was working here all evening.

230
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,160
There's no doubt that Mr. Higashiyama was here.

231
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,760
I dialed the extension myself besides.

232
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,777
The phone over there is hooked on to the wall

233
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,779
and cannot be moved.

234
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,160
In order to go to Mr. Takahata's office

235
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,760
that's in the main building from this room in the annex,

236
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,160
I'd have to cross the connecting corridor.

237
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,791
To go from there to the stairs,

238
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,560
I'd have to pass in front of the elevator.

239
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,960
So if you ask the maintenance men who were checking the elevator,

240
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,760
I'm sure that they will testify that I didn't go pass there.

241
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,360
Can you go from outside to the main building?

242
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,805
If so, you'll have to go pass the entrance

243
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,060
where the security guard is.

244
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:52,460
Either way, the culprit would have to go pass someone.

245
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,160
Can you change the extension number?

246
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,460
Not with this telephone.

247
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,817
There is what is like a concentrated switchboard

248
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:01,260
on the 2nd floor of the main building,

249
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,860
and that's the only place any changes can be made.

250
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,260
Is that right?

251
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,827
Do you do Japanese archery, sir?

252
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:10,460
Yeah.

253
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,160
When I was a student, I did a bit.

254
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,260
Mr. Higashiyama is a really good archery shooter

255
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,260
who won the city tournament.

256
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,560
That's really something!

257
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,160
No, I'm not that great of a shooter.

258
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:27,160
According to the testimony of the security guard,

259
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,360
Mr. Takahata who had been out, returned at 7:10.

260
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,860
After that, the only people who went in or out of the building

261
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,560
were Mr. Mouri and his party.

262
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,060
The elevator maintenance workers

263
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,360
started checking the elevator about 7:00

264
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,160
and saw Mr. Takahata go climbing up the stairs.

265
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,867
Didn't the workers see Ms Sunakawa or Mr. Higashiyama?

266
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:50,860
No. They say that nobody

267
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,860
other than Mr. Takahata went by.

268
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,860
Inspector!

269
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,660
We found the monster balloon and remote controlled gun!

270
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,877
Where were they found?

271
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:00,860
There is a dust chute on the landing of every stairs on every floor

272
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,760
where people can throw trash away.

273
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,060
It was stuck in there.

274
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,260
Around the 3rd and 4th floor.

275
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,760
So the culprit use this and...

276
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,893
And one other thing.

277
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:17,160
This was found on the eaves of the window

278
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,360
of the conference room on the 4th floor.

279
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,260
A fountain pen...

280
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,660
According to the forensic officers,

281
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,260
it's not something that was dropped there today or yesterday.

282
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,907
I don't think it has anything to do with the incident,

283
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:30,909
but just in case...

284
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,460
No, wrong! That fountain pen

285
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,915
is in fact the vital key to solving the incident!

286
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:39,360
I see, I got it!

287
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,360
The one who killed Mr. Takahata is that person!

288
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,530
What is it, Mr. Mouri?

289
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,530
Huh? He's gone.

290
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,530
"Extension 423"

291
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,330
What the?

292
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,530
It's me, Inspector.

293
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,830
Mr. Mouri, where are you?

294
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,949
This is the phone number to Mr. Higashiyama's office.

295
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,530
Inspector.

296
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:16,530
Could you please switch the phone over to speaker phone?

297
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,957
All right.

298
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,830
Mr. Mouri, are you in my office?

299
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,430
I'm sorry to have entered without permission.

300
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:29,930
But it's necessary to solve this case.

301
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,630
Have you come to the truth of the case?

302
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,430
Yes, I've figured everything out.

303
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,977
Mr. Takahata returned at 7:10 tonight.

304
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,930
It began to rain at around 7:30.

305
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,730
In other words, the culprit went to

306
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,830
Mr. Takahata's office during this time

307
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,430
and put him to sleep.

308
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,230
Then, he set up the trick using the Yaiba Show balloon

309
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,830
and left the office.

310
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,630
But, since it began to rain,

311
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,530
before the culprit could carry out his scheme,

312
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,330
the corpse and the floor got wet,

313
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,730
his trick was given away.

314
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,001
Why didn't the culprit push Mr. Takahata out the window

315
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:07,005
as soon as it started raining?

316
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:09,007
It sure is weird.

317
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:12,030
That's because the culprit wanted to be

318
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,630
as far as possible from the place that Mr. Takahata fell from,

319
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,630
since then it would serve as an unfaltering alibi.

320
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,230
Isn't that right, Mr. Higashiyama?

321
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:24,330
The one who killed Mr. Takahata...

322
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,730
is you, Mr. Higashiyama!

323
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,530
What?

324
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:32,530
Just what are you talking about, Mr. Mouri?

325
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,730
I took your call from the annex

326
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,030
in another building when you called,

327
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:39,037
so how could I have killed Mr. Takahata?

328
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:40,830
Mr. Higashiyama.

329
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:44,330
Where do you think I'm calling you from just now?

330
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,530
Where from...

331
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,330
Don't tell me?

332
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,730
Mr. Mouri!

333
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:55,930
Why are you there?

334
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:59,057
Are you really calling from that conference room?

335
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:01,059
Yes.

336
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:03,930
But the extension number is 423.

337
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,930
Extension numbers are not something

338
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,430
that is attached to the telephone itself,

339
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,130
but rather, to the telephone line.

340
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,130
In short, it is something connected to the modular cable

341
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,430
that is attached to the phone.

342
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:20,330
Mr. Higashiyama removed the cable from the phone at his office,

343
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,530
and used the extension cable

344
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,083
and connected it to the phone in the conference room.

345
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:29,087
That way, the extension phone number of this conference room

346
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:31,089
is changed to 423,

347
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:33,091
which is the extension number to Mr. Higashiyama's office.

348
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:37,095
How did he cross the cable between the main building and annex?

349
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,230
Mr. Higashiyama is an expert at Japanese archery.

350
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,730
He probably tied the extension cable and arrow with a long string

351
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,630
and shot that arrow from his office in the annex

352
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,030
to the window of the corridor of the main building.

353
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,330
Then if he pulls that string from the main building,

354
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:54,830
he can cross the extension cable from the annex to the main building.

355
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,230
Mr. Higashiyama.

356
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,117
This is how you connected the cable of your office

357
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:01,530
to the telephone in the conference room.

358
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,430
You then waited until elevator maintenance began at 7:00

359
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,430
and called Ms. Sunakawa,

360
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,530
in order to make it look like you were in your office in the annex.

361
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:12,830
And when you got my call on your extension phone,

362
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:16,030
while picking up my call, you used the monster balloon trick,

363
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,530
and pushed Mr. Takahata out of the window.

364
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,139
After that you re-connected

365
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:23,930
the telephone cable the way it should be,

366
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,630
then hid the gun and balloon

367
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,130
that you retrieved into the dust chute.

368
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,647
You hurried back to your office

369
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:33,151
and retrieved the extension cable,

370
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:35,863
joined Ms. Sunakawa as if nothing had happened

371
00:19:35,863 --> 00:19:37,863
and appeared before us.

372
00:19:37,863 --> 00:19:39,663
Please wait!

373
00:19:39,663 --> 00:19:42,663
How did I get back to the annex?

374
00:19:42,663 --> 00:19:45,163
Yes. In order to get back to the annex,

375
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:46,863
he would've have to go pass

376
00:19:46,863 --> 00:19:48,063
in front of the elevator that was being checked.

377
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:50,263
He went out the 3rd floor window

378
00:19:50,263 --> 00:19:52,963
and crossed above the connecting corridor.

379
00:19:52,963 --> 00:19:55,763
This way, he wouldn't have to be seen by the maintenance workers.

380
00:19:55,763 --> 00:19:58,563
Your statement is based only on assumption!

381
00:19:58,563 --> 00:20:01,663
Do you have proof? Proof!

382
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,363
The extension cable that I am using now

383
00:20:04,363 --> 00:20:06,963
is what I found in your office.

384
00:20:06,963 --> 00:20:10,163
I know of... no such thing!

385
00:20:10,163 --> 00:20:13,863
Mr. Higashiyama, it looks so clear to me.

386
00:20:13,863 --> 00:20:15,193
You're perspiration prone

387
00:20:15,363 --> 00:20:18,263
so you have to keep wiping off sweat.

388
00:20:18,263 --> 00:20:19,763
So much to the point

389
00:20:19,763 --> 00:20:23,463
that the collar of your sky blue dress shirt had turned dark blue.

390
00:20:23,463 --> 00:20:24,963
Yeah.

391
00:20:24,963 --> 00:20:28,163
Is that really perspiration?

392
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:31,209
A fountain pen was found

393
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:34,663
on top of the eaves of the window of this conference room.

394
00:20:34,663 --> 00:20:37,215
When it rains the ink that leaks out from there,

395
00:20:37,463 --> 00:20:40,463
comes dripping mixed in the rain.

396
00:20:40,463 --> 00:20:42,863
When you leaned forward out of the window

397
00:20:42,863 --> 00:20:45,223
to fire at the balloon monster,

398
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:48,163
the ink dropped on your collar.

399
00:20:57,235 --> 00:20:59,237
Mr. Higashiyama.

400
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:01,963
You did it, didn't you?

401
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:08,763
Right, I did it.

402
00:21:09,963 --> 00:21:12,863
The fact is, a small factory that my older brother ran,

403
00:21:12,863 --> 00:21:14,063
fell into financial difficulties,

404
00:21:14,063 --> 00:21:17,663
so I introduced this company to him.

405
00:21:17,663 --> 00:21:20,963
A lot of goods to be used at events were ordered,

406
00:21:20,963 --> 00:21:23,261
so he was very happy.

407
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:26,863
However, Takahata picked on my older brother's weakness

408
00:21:26,863 --> 00:21:28,863
and demanded illegal kick back,

409
00:21:28,863 --> 00:21:32,763
but my brother who had a strong sense of justice refused.

410
00:21:32,763 --> 00:21:36,763
Then, the company refused to pay for the items.

411
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:39,663
You could've sued them for breeching of contract.

412
00:21:39,663 --> 00:21:41,863
Takahata had seen through that and schemed it

413
00:21:41,863 --> 00:21:44,963
so that he could get away with it.

414
00:21:44,963 --> 00:21:49,287
My older brother ended up with a large amount of debt

415
00:21:49,463 --> 00:21:51,289
and he committed suicide.

416
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:52,963
Oh, no...

417
00:21:52,963 --> 00:21:56,463
That's why I killed him!

418
00:21:56,463 --> 00:21:59,863
With the things that he used to carry out his plan for events!

419
00:21:59,863 --> 00:22:02,263
I was sure it was going to work out well!

420
00:22:03,563 --> 00:22:06,363
I figured that if the renown detective Kogoro Mouri was my witness,

421
00:22:06,363 --> 00:22:09,763
I could surely succeed assured!

422
00:22:09,763 --> 00:22:13,763
Only if... Only if it didn't rain!

423
00:23:53,411 --> 00:23:56,063
I'm upside down!

424
00:23:56,063 --> 00:23:59,417
I guess Pops is wide awake now?

425
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

426
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,032
"Outdoor spa on the lake"

427
00:24:06,032 --> 00:24:08,260
This place is full of open air baths. It looks like fun!

428
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,440
Pops, you're going to stay back home.

429
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,140
What? No way! I'm going no matter what!
