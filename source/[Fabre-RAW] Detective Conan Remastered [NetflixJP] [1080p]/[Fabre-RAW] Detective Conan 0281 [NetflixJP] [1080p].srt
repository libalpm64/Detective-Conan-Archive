1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,770
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,670
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,270
The Youth Detective Squad is energetic as always.

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,270
They accidentally came across a crime scene.

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,970
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,870
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,270
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,610
Help!

9
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,710
Help!

10
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,310
Help!

11
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,710
Help! Help!

12
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,810
Ayumi. You're not supposed to laugh here.

13
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,610
You must scream.

14
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,710
Suspense was building, and you messed it up.

15
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,210
I'm so sorry.

16
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,110
It was so funny.

17
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,910
Darn it.

18
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,810
Then, let's play the game of "The Case of the Bald Head".

19
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:52,010
How about "The Case of the Abducted Pretty Blonde Girl"?

20
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,410
Oh, but... it's about time we go home.

21
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,010
Oh, yes. It's Yaiba Day.

22
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,210
It's the last episode of the Yaiba series.

23
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,410
We can't miss it.

24
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,210
What was that?

25
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,810
What are you doing, Mr. Kurata?

26
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,210
Shut up! You traitor!

27
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,510
I know everything you've done, Suzuki.

28
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,810
What are you talking about?

29
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,810
You're trying to join Sanada Transport

30
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,410
and take our customers with you, right?

31
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,010
Why...

32
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,510
I won't let you, turncoat.

33
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,910
No.

34
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,610
I'm not letting you out.

35
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,110
What shall we do?

36
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,410
What? If we don't stop them, it will become a serious problem.

37
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,910
But, how are we to stop them?

38
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,910
Well...

39
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,210
We... we're in trouble.

40
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,710
It's a real...

41
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,210
Murder.

42
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:11,210
"Little Witnesses"

43
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,510
"Mouri Detective Agency"

44
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,310
The shadow of the Yaiba pretender threatens Shunsuke.

45
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,610
What can you do, Satoshi? What can you do, our hero Yaiba?

46
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,010
The Masked Yaiba.

47
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,710
The Last Days of the Yaiba Pretender.

48
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,910
From 7:30 tonight.

49
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,110
Don't miss it. Yaiba Kick!

50
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,710
Conan here. What happened?

51
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,010
Is that you, Conan? Help. Somebody's been killed.

52
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,410
What? Where are you, Ayumi?

53
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,410
We are...

54
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:46,010
We've got to hurry. He's going to move out the body.

55
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,210
What?

56
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,510
What are we to do, Mitsuhiko?

57
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,610
No choice.

58
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,610
We have to get on the truck now to find out where he's going.

59
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,010
All right.

60
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,410
Hey. What happened, Ayumi?

61
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,010
Answer me!

62
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,010
The Squad badge.

63
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,310
Did you drop it?

64
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,710
Looks like it.

65
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,210
Never mind, we have no choice.

66
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,010
The man will be back right away.

67
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,310
Ayumi? Can you hear me?

68
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,410
Say something! Ayumi!

69
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,010
Ayumi!

70
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,710
Ayumi? What happened? Ayumi!

71
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,410
Is that blood?

72
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,710
What?

73
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,310
Looks like it.

74
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,310
I'm sorry, guys.

75
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,410
If I didn't lose the badge, Conan will be here.

76
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,610
It's not your fault.

77
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,010
Don't forget that we forgot our own badges.

78
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,710
But...

79
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,810
Anyway, where is this truck heading?

80
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,410
Well...

81
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,210
He might be planning to dump it in the ocean or in the mountains.

82
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,410
That any rate, we have no choice but to see everything through.

83
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,510
Remember, in the name of the Youth Detective Squad.

84
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,710
I've never seen this place before.

85
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,310
What?

86
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,110
Hey, it stopped.

87
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:10,210
Gee, I wish this happened tomorrow.

88
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,110
Why so?

89
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,010
Today is Yaiba Day, remember?

90
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,610
I was looking forward to this day.

91
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,710
Good grief.

92
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:23,110
It is the Masked Yaiba!

93
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,110
There it is.

94
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,410
There you go.

95
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,210
Yaiba. Miracle. Kick.

96
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,410
Hey, stop! Don't move!

97
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,210
Genta, turn down the volume.

98
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,710
He'll hear you from the driver's seat.

99
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,410
Darn. The story was just getting better.

100
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,210
It's a train.

101
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,610
It seems it's getting quieter.

102
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,710
Yeah.

103
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,510
I think we're getting on an unpaved road.

104
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,210
Are we in the mountains?

105
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,510
It stopped.

106
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,410
We're getting there.

107
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,210
What's that sound?

108
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,210
He must be digging a hole.

109
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,710
A hole for what?

110
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,810
Of course.

111
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:46,210
To put the dead body in.

112
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,710
How long are we supposed to be doing this?

113
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,510
I actually want to go to the boy's room.

114
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,410
Looks like there is traffic jam.

115
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,010
This is our chance.

116
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,510
Let's escape.

117
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,210
Hurry up and make a phone call.

118
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,310
Did you see the license plate?

119
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,010
Yes. Shinjuku 1015.

120
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,610
Yes. This is the Mouri Detective Agency.

121
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,710
Conan.

122
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,610
Ayumi?

123
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,810
Where are you now? Is everyone all right?

124
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,910
Yes, we're all right.

125
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,110
Right now, we just escaped.

126
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,210
Let me see... where are we...

127
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,510
So, this is where the crime took place?

128
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,910
Yes, no question about it.

129
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,710
Gosh.

130
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:09,910
Calling me so early when I have a hangover.

131
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,510
There was a murder!

132
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,910
A man named Suzuki was killed here.

133
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,110
The culprit is...

134
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,710
The culprit is Kurata. The victim is Suzuki.

135
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,510
That is how they were calling each other, right?

136
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,210
Exactly.

137
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,910
In addition, we have seen the truck that the killer used.

138
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:33,310
Yes, Shinjuku 1015.

139
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,610
Well, the truck in question is registered

140
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,510
to a freight company called Kurata Transport.

141
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,110
Kurata Transport.

142
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,810
The address is just around here.

143
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,910
-Let's give it a try. -Okay.

144
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,210
Hello.

145
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,210
Yes, may I help you?

146
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,410
-Mr. Mouri. -Okay.

147
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:01,010
My name is Kogoro Mouri of the Mouri Detective Agency.

148
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,210
Yes?

149
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,910
Kogoro Mouri, you must be...

150
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,010
Amazing!

151
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,410
I'm a great fan of Sleeping Kogoro.

152
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,110
Well, thank you.

153
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,210
I'd be happy to cooperate.

154
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,810
Well, actually, these children

155
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,310
insist that they have seen a strange incident last night.

156
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,910
That's why I'm making an inquiry.

157
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,010
It's him.

158
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,810
I won't let you, turncoat.

159
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,510
He is the killer, Conan.

160
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,510
Hey, kids.

161
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,410
Ma'am, is this person the president, Mr. Kurata?

162
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,710
Yes. But why?

163
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,910
Where is he now?

164
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,610
We want to see him here.

165
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,110
We have something to ask him.

166
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:49,610
Hey, hey. Kids. Calm down.

167
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,610
Mr. Kurata usually comes to the office past noon.

168
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,610
Past noon?

169
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,510
There is possibility of an escaped.

170
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,110
Hold it, hold it.

171
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:03,010
Is there a person named Suzuki here?

172
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,910
You mean Director Suzuki?

173
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,410
Mr. Suzuki? Look there.

174
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,010
You see him on that photo we took when we went on an employee trip.

175
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:17,110
You see him here, the one smoking at the fringe of the group.

176
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,410
And then. This Mr. Suzuki, where is he?

177
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:24,110
Well, he's missing.

178
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,110
Kaori, what do you mean by that?

179
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,110
Hey, didn't I tell you?

180
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:31,310
I got a call from his wife telling me

181
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,210
he hasn't returned home last night.

182
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,210
I wonder.

183
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,110
He is a very hardworking, sincere man.

184
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,910
Maybe he's stressed out.

185
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,910
I saw him arguing with the president the other day.

186
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,310
What?

187
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,110
You mean Mr. Kurata and Mr. Suzuki

188
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,210
aren't getting along with each other?

189
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,110
You bet.

190
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,810
The two started this company together 20 years ago.

191
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,810
But now they are on each other's throat.

192
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,010
Everybody's talking that Mr. Suzuki is planning to leave

193
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,810
and start his own business.

194
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,510
That's enough, Kaori.

195
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,710
No big deal. Everybody knows that.

196
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:15,110
Shinjuku 1015.

197
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,010
This is it.

198
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,010
Did you find the bloodstain?

199
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,610
That's solid evidence.

200
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,010
I saw that last night.

201
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:32,010
He used this truck to carry off the body.

202
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,210
No, this is paint.

203
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,210
-Paint? -No kidding.

204
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,210
You made a mistake, because it was dark.

205
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,410
But...

206
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,710
Look at that.

207
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,210
It was all your imagination.

208
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:49,210
You might have taken a mannequin for a dead body.

209
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,710
All those detective games you play

210
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,010
are making you imagine things.

211
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,710
It's not imagination.

212
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,210
It's true!

213
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,710
Mr. Kurata really did dump a body in the mountains.

214
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,510
Then, did you see him bury the body?

215
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,210
Give me the truth.

216
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:09,310
Did you really see with your own eyes?

217
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,410
Well...

218
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,810
What a waste waking up so early in the morning.

219
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,910
I apologize for this. Interrupting you during business hours.

220
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,610
No trouble.

221
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,910
Then, this is it.

222
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:27,410
I'm going back to bed.

223
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,210
You should all go back home.

224
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,710
Conan.

225
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,310
Conan, you do believe us, don't you?

226
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,910
What we need to do is to identify the location

227
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,610
where the victim was buried.

228
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,710
If we can find the body, your claim will be proven.

229
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,310
Okay.

230
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,810
Around 7:10 p.m., the truck with the body

231
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,810
left from the front of this building.

232
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:17,510
It took roughly three hours from departure until we returned.

233
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,210
In other words, it took 90 minutes one way

234
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,110
to reach the mountains where Director Suzuki was buried.

235
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:28,210
Mountains that can be reached in about 90 minutes are...

236
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,510
There are three possible routes.

237
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,910
Could you tell which direction you went?

238
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,610
Well, I'm sorry we couldn't tell at all.

239
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,210
Couldn't you see something?

240
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:44,910
We were in a strange town.

241
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,910
I saw White Duck.

242
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,710
White Duck is a major convenience store chain.

243
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,410
It has lots of stores in the city.

244
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:00,310
Yes. I could smell broiled eel on the way.

245
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,810
Let's check all the eel restaurants in the city.

246
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,510
We'll know for sure.

247
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,410
Can't you think of anything better?

248
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:12,010
I was counting the number of gas stations.

249
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:15,110
There was Heart Sekiyu on the right side of the road.

250
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,910
Next, there was MM Sekiyu.

251
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,910
Then another Heart Sekiyu.

252
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,610
That's how many I could see.

253
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:29,510
Heart Seikyu. MM Sekiyu and Heart Sekiyu.

254
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,710
The route might have been this.

255
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,610
Yes. I saw the Masked Yaiba.

256
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,610
Masked Yaiba?

257
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,610
I saw it on TV at an electrical appliance store.

258
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:46,110
It was right at the best part Yaiba Miracle Kick.

259
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,210
Then the truck started moving.

260
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:52,910
Then, the truck stopped there, right?

261
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,610
Yeah.

262
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,510
It must have stopped at a traffic light.

263
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,310
It stopped for quite a long time.

264
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,210
Yeah. And then...

265
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,110
Right after the truck started moving,

266
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:07,010
a train passed right above us.

267
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,410
Train passing above?

268
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,110
A railway overpass.

269
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:19,010
That means the truck passed under it around 7:50.

270
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,110
What?

271
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,910
How do you know it was 7:50?

272
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:29,310
The Masked Yaiba's kick comes out at around 7:50 all the time.

273
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,510
Yes.

274
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,110
7:50 p.m.

275
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,610
That's about 40 minutes after the truck left this place.

276
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,110
It crossed an overpass then,

277
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,610
plus it was a point with traffic lights.

278
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:47,110
The only mountain you can get to in 90 minutes along this route is...

279
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,210
Here.

280
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,610
It's scary.

281
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,210
Tire tracks.

282
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,610
They're still fresh.

283
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,410
That way.

284
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,110
The truck stopped here.

285
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,110
Look.

286
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:44,110
Soil just recently turned up under the leaves.

287
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,810
We found it.

288
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,110
Let's dig.

289
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,510
Here?

290
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,610
We found it.

291
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,410
Oh, no.

292
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,310
What's going on?

293
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:23,210
Conan. What is this?

294
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,310
Well, the truth is...

295
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:29,910
When Kurata and Suzuki were fighting, something happened.

296
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:36,710
That made the killer, the victim and the victim, the killer.

297
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,910
Kurata getting killed,

298
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:44,810
and Suzuki over there becoming the killer.

299
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:53,110
Did I get anything wrong, Mr. Suzuki?

300
00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:00,210
I knew it when I saw the ashtray inside the truck.

301
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:04,710
All of the cigarette butts in the mound were put out

302
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:08,910
the same way crushed at the tip and bent sharply.

303
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,610
Exactly the same as the cigarette butts in front of you

304
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,710
in the group photo taken during the trip

305
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,110
and the same brand.

306
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,510
When I saw that, I was convinced that

307
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,910
the man who drove the truck for 3 hours last night

308
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:28,910
was not Mr. Kurata, but you.

309
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:35,310
I didn't mean to kill him. It was self defense.

310
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,710
It is for the judge to decide, not us.

311
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,510
You brat.

312
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:47,710
I'm no brat.

313
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,910
I'm Conan Edogawa, a detective.

314
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,710
And we are...

315
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,210
The Youth Detective Squad.

316
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,510
He was wrong!

317
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,610
It's not my fault.

318
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,010
I just... just...

319
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,710
Oh, darn it.

320
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:12,310
Oh, yes. I forgot to tell you.

321
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,810
I've already reported to the police.

322
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,510
Darn it!

323
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,910
Ouch...

324
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,410
Don't move.

325
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,810
Keep still.

326
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,410
Give up.

327
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,010
You, brats!

328
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:54,110
Hey, what happened to him?

329
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,510
He tripped on himself and passed out.

330
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,310
-That means... -We did it!

331
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:03,910
Another victory for the Youth Detective Squad!

332
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,210
Conan.

333
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,110
Let's play.

334
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:49,610
Why don't we play another detective game?

335
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:51,910
Let's go look for another crime.

336
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:55,610
You must join us next time.

337
00:23:55,610 --> 00:24:00,410
Hey, I'm not... when do you learn?

338
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,800
