1
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,740
Hey, we're in trouble, the culprit's still here!

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,040
At any rate, let's get out of here!

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,740
But, we've got to rescue that boy!

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,340
Hey, you guys! Stay close to me!

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,740
Right. If we split up, that's it.

6
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,940
We could end up like that boy.

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,540
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

8
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,840
You must be true to yourself.

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,940
The sound of piano playing echoes throughout the empty villa,

10
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,040
together with the secret of a diary.

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

12
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

13
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,340
His name is Detective Conan!

14
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:41,170
"The Secret Played by the Diary (Part 1)"

15
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,061
"24th April"

16
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,170
This is no good, sir!

17
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,370
The engine's burnt because of an oil leak.

18
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,570
We've got to take it to the repair factory

19
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,370
and fix it or it won't move.

20
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,670
For now,

21
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,170
we'll tow it away.

22
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,870
Hey... you mean you're going to leave us here and leave?

23
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,770
I guess so.

24
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,070
Even if I were to suggest that you

25
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,470
take public transportation town,

26
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,070
that won't do,

27
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,970
because in the mountains like this no buses or cabs would go by.

28
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,370
What?

29
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,370
You mean we're going to have to walk

30
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,870
to get down from the mountains?

31
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,070
It's pretty far, you know.

32
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,370
Can't you give us a lift in your car?

33
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,570
Well, maybe just one adult,

34
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,470
but not all of you.

35
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,070
Then, why don't you have them give you a lift, Doc?

36
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,170
Have them take you to town and come back in a rental car.

37
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,770
It'll take only about an hour besides.

38
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,570
That's right!

39
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:45,770
Okay then, you all wait for me there!

40
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,970
It's already

41
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,570
an hour and a half since Doc left.

42
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,170
No doubt about it.

43
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,070
No doubt that he got lost.

44
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,270
Very likely!

45
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,670
I'm hungry.

46
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,670
Some bamboo-shoot picking day this turned out to be.

47
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,370
We picked a lot, though!

48
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:20,160
Shoots! And we were supposed to have mushroom rice for dinner at Doc's house tonight!

49
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,160
Rain?

50
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,360
No... no joke?

51
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,260
We don't have umbrellas!

52
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,660
Come to think of it, the place we passed by a while ago

53
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,260
was a villa district,

54
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,460
so why don't we go take shelter from the rain there.

55
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,160
Good idea.

56
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,860
Hey, Conan. Nobody seems to be here.

57
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,560
Well, it's off season.

58
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,360
True.

59
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,860
It's getting dark.

60
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,860
Why don't we take shelter under the eaves for now?

61
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,360
And, can't you get hold of Doc yet?

62
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,760
No.

63
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,960
I've been trying to call him from a while ago,

64
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,160
but it seems his cell is switched off.

65
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,660
It's from Doc's house?

66
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,860
Hey, just what do you think you're doing, Doc!

67
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,260
I'm sorry, so sorry...

68
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,860
I didn't want to lose my wallet and cell phone

69
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,560
while I was picking bamboo-shoot.

70
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,960
I'd forgotten that I had put them in Ai's knapsack.

71
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,560
So, I came all the way home to get them,

72
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,660
that's why I'm late.

73
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,160
I'm heading over there from now with a rental car,

74
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,560
so hang in there for another 2 hours, will you?

75
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,060
So he says!

76
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,560
What? We have to wait two hours?

77
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,860
No joke!

78
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,160
Oh boy... and it's starting to rain harder too!

79
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,760
Hang in there!

80
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,960
Getting angry isn't going to fill your stomach up.

81
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,960
She's right.

82
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,660
The sound of a piano.

83
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,460
I hear it.

84
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,960
It's coming from that house.

85
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,560
We have heard that music before, right?

86
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,660
Yeah?

87
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,660
I heard it being played on the violin before.

88
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,760
What was the title of the song? Conan, do you know?

89
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,360
No, I'm really not at home with music.

90
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,260
Composed by Johann Sebastian Bach.

91
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,160
The Orchestral Suites, Suite no. 3 in D major.

92
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,560
2nd movement, "Air".

93
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,060
Commonly known as...

94
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,560
"Air" on the G String.

95
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,360
I've heard that title before!

96
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,460
The player is as good as a professional pianist.

97
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,260
Okay then, let's go ask if we can take shelter there.

98
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,260
Okay!

99
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,760
I wonder if they'll make us bamboo rice?

100
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,160
I don't think so.

101
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,660
The piano stopped.

102
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,660
A hope it's someone nice!

103
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,860
No one's coming.

104
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,760
There's no answer on the interphone.

105
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,560
Strange.

106
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,960
The door's not locked.

107
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,860
Hello!

108
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,260
We'd like to take shelter from the rain here for a while!

109
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,760
It's... pitch dark.

110
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,560
I wonder why the lights aren't turned on?

111
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,960
I stepped on something!

112
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,960
Potato chips?

113
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,160
They're scattered all over the floor.

114
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,360
There seems to be a misbehaved child here.

115
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,860
Hey,

116
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,760
come over here everybody!

117
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,860
I found the piano!

118
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,860
But, if the person was playing this piano,

119
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,560
why didn't he or she come out to greet us?

120
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,960
Maybe nobody was playing.

121
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,860
Because there are a lot of audio devices and CDs here.

122
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,560
It could be that one of the CDs here was being played.

123
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,060
The pianist was too good too.

124
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,560
No, it was the sound of this piano without a doubt.

125
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,860
That music that was being played a while ago.

126
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,260
Only this sound was a bit off tune.

127
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,260
You've got a good ear,

128
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,960
despite being as tone-deaf as you are.

129
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,360
Leave me alone.

130
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,060
I'll play you something!

131
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,560
I can play the Flea Waltz!

132
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,160
Don't, you'll get scolded!

133
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,060
We'd better look for the owner of the house.

134
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,260
Mitsuhiko?

135
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,560
A tall person was staring in

136
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,660
from the window of that door!

137
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,660
Maybe it's the owner of the house!

138
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,760
We've got to say hello.

139
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,160
It's stuck.

140
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,360
A cart?

141
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,660
Hey! Didn't we turn on the corridor lights?

142
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,260
Yes!

143
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,960
Does that mean someone turned it off?

144
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,760
Maybe he plans to lock us in here.

145
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,660
No way.

146
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,560
We're sorry!

147
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,060
We're not bad people!

148
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,560
Please come out here!

149
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,160
There's a room with the lights on!

150
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,960
Really.

151
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,560
Maybe somebody's there!

152
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,660
This seems to be the kitchen.

153
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,560
But, what's with the top of this table.

154
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,960
There are a lot of left-overs of fried chicken, bread and ham.

155
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,060
It looks like a dog or something ate here and messed up.

156
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,160
The owner of the house must sure be some wild person.

157
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,460
The wine glass is left toppled over too.

158
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,160
A notebook?

159
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,860
Does it belong to the owner of this villa?

160
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,660
April 20th, sunny.

161
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,260
After talking to him, I found that he was quite a nice child.

162
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,560
He laughs a lot and plays a lot.

163
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,760
But, I'm not sure if he understands the situation he is in now.

164
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,260
I only know that this child seems

165
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,260
to have spent a greatly oppressed life.

166
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,960
At any rate, it's only two days more.

167
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Patience till then.

168
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,460
April 22, cloudy.

169
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,060
Bach, Mozart, Chopin, Beethoven.

170
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,260
They're all melodies that touch the heart.

171
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,560
A genius born in the same era.

172
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,760
I envy that talent.

173
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,160
It's not a suitable song to play under this circumstance,

174
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,660
but I can forget the passing of time.

175
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,660
Please let one more day go by peacefully.

176
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,260
April 23rd, rain.

177
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,260
It's bad.

178
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,260
It seems that this boy knows who I am.

179
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,860
If he were to announce it to the public,

180
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,060
it would ruin my future.

181
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,260
I feel sorry for him,

182
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,960
but I guess I have no choice but to kill him.

183
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,660
Kill?

184
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,360
Just what does that mean?

185
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,160
He was probably kidnapped.

186
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,660
Somebody kidnapped a little boy

187
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,460
and confined him in this house.

188
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,960
Oh, no.

189
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,860
What's written on the next page?

190
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,660
The pages are stuck together.

191
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,760
And I can't peel it off.

192
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,560
A blackout?

193
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,960
By the way, the page just now had something red on it?

194
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,760
Isn't... it blood?

195
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,560
Moreover, the content says,

196
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,960
"I'm sorry, sonny, please forgive me".

197
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,460
The... sound of the piano.

198
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,760
It... it's the song that was being played a while ago.

199
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,460
We've got trouble! The culprit's still here?

200
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,860
At any rate, let... let's hurry and get out of here!

201
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,660
But, we've got to rescue the boy!

202
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,460
Hey! Wait a sec!

203
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,660
You guys stay close to me!

204
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,560
Right. If we split up, that's it.

205
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,160
We may end up like the boy.

206
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,460
A coffin!

207
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,860
Hey! Didn't the Air on the G String gain popularity...

208
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,960
100 years after Bach's death.

209
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,160
Maybe the culprit intended to leave the boy asleep for that long

210
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
in this coffin.

211
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,460
Conan, what're you going to do about this?

212
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,900
Well, I guess we'll just have to open it.

213
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,500
Please wait!

214
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,200
From the contents of the diary we found earlier,

215
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,100
we know that someone had kidnapped a young boy

216
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,800
and confined him here.

217
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,300
And because it seemed the child knew who his captor was,

218
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,000
there was no choice but to kill him, right?

219
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,500
Yes. Moreover, on the last page of the diary,

220
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,200
there something red on it,

221
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,900
and the thing that was written is

222
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,800
"I'm sorry, sonny, please forgive me".

223
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,400
Then, maybe in that coffin...

224
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,400
The corpse of that boy is inside.

225
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,700
Yeah. Could be.

226
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,000
No...

227
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,900
Hey, Ai, pull them away!

228
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,700
It's not something children should see.

229
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,000
I guess not.

230
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,300
I mean, you're a child too, aren't you?

231
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,300
Never mind, just stand back!

232
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,500
It's empty. Nothing's inside.

233
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,100
Thank goodness!

234
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,200
Which means, that boy may still be alive.

235
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,400
If he were killed,

236
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,700
the culprit would've put him inside that coffin.

237
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,500
He couldn't be playing the piano, like he was.

238
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,200
At any rate, we've got to call the police.

239
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,200
Does somebody have a cell phone?

240
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,200
I left mine in my knapsack a while ago.

241
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,600
Me too.

242
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,800
Same here.

243
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,200
Me too.

244
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,900
Hey, don't tell me that the place you left it,

245
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,400
is in the first room that we went to when we came to this villa.

246
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,900
Not... not again.

247
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,400
It's the same song that was played a while ago.

248
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,800
Air on the G String.

249
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,400
Why'd all of you leave it in the room where the piano is?

250
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,700
Because you left it back there, Conan.

251
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,600
We put it there together.

252
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,800
It can't be helped already, right?

253
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,500
Rather than that.

254
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,400
Let's all go back to the room with the piano

255
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,600
and get our cell phones back.

256
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,700
True.

257
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,000
Don't be silly. We don't even know

258
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,400
what kind of weapon the culprit may have,

259
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,000
so who knows what will happen to us if we get close carelessly.

260
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,600
But, we've got to do something quick or the boy may...

261
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,900
Doc'll be here about an hour later.

262
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,700
We could leave this villa and wait outside till then,

263
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,400
but it's raining cats and dogs outside.

264
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,200
Just waiting's not going to get us anywhere,

265
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,000
so why don't we all search for that boy.

266
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,100
Okay!

267
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,500
Isn't it too dangerous?

268
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,700
The kidnapper is still here, you know?

269
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,200
No need to worry.

270
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,000
So long as that piano is playing, the culprit is in that room.

271
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,900
But there could be more than one culprit.

272
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,300
There's probably just one culprit

273
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,700
because the diary was written in the first person.

274
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,500
Besides, there's nothing written that points to an accomplice,

275
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,200
and there was only one wine glass too.

276
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,200
But, stay close to me, understand?

277
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,300
Aye!

278
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:28,000
But, why doesn't the culprit come to get us?

279
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,700
Maybe because he doesn't want us to see his face?

280
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,800
If he goofs and we get away

281
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,800
and report to the police what he looks like, it'll put him in a fix.

282
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,000
Maybe that's why he's playing the piano in the dark.

283
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,600
He probably wants us to feel creepy and leave.

284
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,100
He probably hasn't realized yet

285
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,100
that we read the diary and found out

286
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,800
that he is a kidnapper.

287
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,200
But, either way, if the owner of this villa were to check later on,

288
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,500
he would find out who the culprit is.

289
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,700
Maybe he's not the owner of this house.

290
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,100
What?

291
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:06,000
At this point, it's more natural to think that the culprit broke open

292
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,600
one of the doors of this house,

293
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,000
faking to be some rich man

294
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,100
and brought the boy here.

295
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,800
Is the piano still playing?

296
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,900
Yes, it's still playing.

297
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,300
It's amazing how he can play in pitch dark.

298
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,300
His fingers remember the position of the keys.

299
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,800
There are blind pianists too, you know.

300
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,200
But, what's with this room?

301
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,000
It looks like a child's room.

302
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,600
It looks like a girl's room.

303
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,600
Chips are scattered here too.

304
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
Yeah.

305
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,000
It's a portable game device.

306
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,800
And, what're these drawings

307
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,800
in back of the leaflets of the newspaper that are cluttered

308
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,300
and looks like some kind of coded diagram?

309
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,100
That's a treasure map of Monster Getter III.

310
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,100
If you don't draw the map that you get from the game onto something else,

311
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,400
it'll be hard to find the treasure.

312
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,200
It seems like the culprit kept the child confined to this room

313
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,500
and let him keep playing the game.

314
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Yeah.

315
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,400
It's 30 minutes till Doc gets here.

316
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,600
This is the kitchen where we came a while ago, right?

317
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,900
Did we go right around?

318
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,600
No. There was a forked corridor.

319
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,700
There still must be places that we haven't searched yet.

320
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,800
Right... Like the place just beyond here.

321
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,000
Something's shining.

322
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,600
Water?

323
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,200
Hot water.

324
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,300
Why in a place like this?

325
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,900
A picture?

326
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,400
Strange.

327
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
The dishes are all washed

328
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,900
and the trash is divided like it should be.

329
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,300
So, the person is probably a neat person and yet.

330
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,100
I wonder why half-eaten left-overs

331
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,500
are messily left on the table then.

332
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,000
Hey! Ayumi's gone!

333
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,200
Don't tell me that the culprit got her?

334
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,100
It can't be! The piano's still playing, besides.

335
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,300
No, it's a different sound from that piano.

336
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,500
Don't you think it's strangely out of tune!

337
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,200
Maybe the CD in that room

338
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,100
was being played endlessly to make us think he was playing.

339
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,400
Maybe he was secretly following us around.

340
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,200
Oh no...

341
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,700
Let's hurry and go look for her.

342
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,200
It could be that she's just lost too.

343
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,500
Hey, did you find her?

344
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,300
Nowhere at all.

345
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,700
Then, maybe the culprit got her after all.

346
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,500
If worse comes to worst, he could already be killed.

347
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,500
No, you mean he was already killed?

348
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,600
No. I'm just saying there's a possibility.

349
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,400
Oh no.

350
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
What?

351
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,800
Ayumi, where were you?

352
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,000
I was here all the while.

353
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,400
Answer us if you were there then.

354
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,900
I thought that you were looking for the boy.

355
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,800
Because you all rushed out of the kitchen in a hurry.

356
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,900
Oh, that's right! I found a picture!

357
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,000
What?

358
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,500
A family picture.

359
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,900
They seem to be a family of musicians.

360
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,900
The picture is dated a year ago.

361
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,000
Could the child in the center

362
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,300
have been the one who was kidnapped?

363
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,800
No. Because the child in the picture is a girl.

364
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,400
He's right. The one in the picture is either

365
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,200
without a doubt the owner of this house or...

366
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,000
a picture of the kidnapper.

367
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,200
The culprit?

368
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,400
Oh, no.

369
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,200
The key to this case should be hidden in this diary.

370
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,700
I'll solve the case no matter what.

371
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,960
Next Conan's Hint:

372
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,760
"Piano chair"

373
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,040
Did you figure out the secret of the diary?

374
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,320
-Yeah. -Let's keep it a secret till next week.
