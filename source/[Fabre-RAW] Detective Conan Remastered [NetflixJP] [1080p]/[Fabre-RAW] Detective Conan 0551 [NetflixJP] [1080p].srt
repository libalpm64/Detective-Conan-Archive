1
00:00:02,442 --> 00:00:05,985
Nationwide Mr. Kojima Contest?

2
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:09,989
Is your father going to enter that contest?

3
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:15,042
Yeah, it seems he made it through the "pry Mary entree"!

4
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:16,742
Pry Mary entree?

5
00:00:16,742 --> 00:00:17,997
What's that?

6
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:21,042
He passed the primary entry.

7
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:22,442
The judges look through the pictures

8
00:00:22,442 --> 00:00:24,842
and profile that the candidates send in

9
00:00:24,842 --> 00:00:26,842
and narrow down the contestants.

10
00:00:26,842 --> 00:00:29,042
My Dad is a real man

11
00:00:29,042 --> 00:00:31,542
so it was already certain that he would be chosen.

12
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:34,013
I've never met him,

13
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:36,542
but I'll bet he's the typical "you know" type.

14
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:38,842
And? If he wins the contest,

15
00:00:38,842 --> 00:00:40,342
does he get anything?

16
00:00:40,342 --> 00:00:42,042
In the letter that he got from them,

17
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,442
it said that he would get money.

18
00:00:44,442 --> 00:00:45,442
If I remember correctly,

19
00:00:45,442 --> 00:00:49,442
there were 7 zeros after the number 1.

20
00:00:49,442 --> 00:00:52,031
7 zeros.

21
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:54,033
That's 10,000,000 yen!

22
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:55,742
Wow!

23
00:00:55,742 --> 00:00:58,037
Who planned it?

24
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:00,039
Whose plan?

25
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,042
Who sent him the letter? Who is it?

26
00:01:04,042 --> 00:01:06,742
Nichiuri TV was written on it.

27
00:01:06,742 --> 00:01:08,942
But it seems that Dad's more interested

28
00:01:08,942 --> 00:01:10,742
in the wild boar hanging scroll

29
00:01:10,742 --> 00:01:14,053
that comes with the money more than the money.

30
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:16,642
If it's really from Nichiuri TV,

31
00:01:16,642 --> 00:01:18,642
I guess it's not a fraud or anything.

32
00:01:18,642 --> 00:01:20,442
It's quite a large sum of money.

33
00:01:20,442 --> 00:01:23,342
You mean it's a drawing of a wild boar?

34
00:01:23,342 --> 00:01:26,342
Yeah. I saw the picture in the letter

35
00:01:26,342 --> 00:01:28,442
and it was a black and white drawing.

36
00:01:28,442 --> 00:01:31,142
I didn't think that it was all that great,

37
00:01:31,142 --> 00:01:34,073
but Dad liked wild boars from before

38
00:01:34,242 --> 00:01:36,942
and said that he wanted to decorate it in the alcove.

39
00:01:36,942 --> 00:01:39,042
He said that he liked it

40
00:01:39,042 --> 00:01:41,542
also because the artist's name read "thank you"!

41
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:43,142
"Thank you"?

42
00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:47,442
Genta, it could be that the money

43
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:49,342
is what comes along with the picture.

44
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:50,542
What?

45
00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:53,742
You mean the 10,000,000 is what comes along with the drawing?

46
00:01:54,742 --> 00:01:56,942
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

47
00:01:56,942 --> 00:01:59,442
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

48
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:00,442
An unexpected turn of events.

49
00:02:00,442 --> 00:02:03,642
Genta's father is thought to be the culprit and is in a fix.

50
00:02:03,642 --> 00:02:05,242
He sees through the one and only truth.

51
00:02:05,242 --> 00:02:07,142
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

52
00:02:07,142 --> 00:02:09,242
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

53
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:55,998
"The Culprit is Genta's Father (Part 1)"

54
00:03:57,098 --> 00:04:00,698
What? It's worth 50,000,000 yen?

55
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,998
You mean this hanging scroll?

56
00:04:02,998 --> 00:04:06,998
Yeah. If it's really a black and white hanging scroll

57
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:09,998
drawn by the renown Sankyu Shonin.

58
00:04:09,998 --> 00:04:13,398
I have a feeling I've seen this picture somewhere before.

59
00:04:13,398 --> 00:04:14,498
Me too.

60
00:04:14,498 --> 00:04:17,098
Dad said the same thing too.

61
00:04:17,098 --> 00:04:19,298
This is the wild boar of Hagi.

62
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:22,241
It's one of the pictures seen in the card game called Hana Fuda.

63
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:27,698
And why is this picture of Hana Fuda so valuable?

64
00:04:27,698 --> 00:04:31,898
Yeah. When that hanging scroll was first discovered,

65
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:33,298
it was said that the drawing

66
00:04:33,298 --> 00:04:35,598
was a no-good piece that Sankyu drew as a joke.

67
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:38,257
But, later, the hanging scroll of a deer

68
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:40,898
and butterfly were also found,

69
00:04:40,898 --> 00:04:43,098
and the value of the drawing soar up.

70
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:44,598
Because with the three together

71
00:04:44,598 --> 00:04:45,898
"wild boar, deer, and butterfly",

72
00:04:45,898 --> 00:04:48,267
it was said to bring good luck.

73
00:04:49,698 --> 00:04:52,271
In fact, it's said that a businessman of Iwate

74
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:53,998
who purchased the three scrolls

75
00:04:53,998 --> 00:04:55,498
investing all the money that he had,

76
00:04:55,498 --> 00:04:59,398
succeeded and built financial status for himself.

77
00:04:59,398 --> 00:05:01,498
And since then, that's how much the scrolls are worth.

78
00:05:01,498 --> 00:05:04,898
So, it's indeed a hanging scroll that brings happiness.

79
00:05:04,898 --> 00:05:08,798
But, since one of them is the award,

80
00:05:08,798 --> 00:05:11,298
that businessman must've let go of the drawings.

81
00:05:11,298 --> 00:05:12,798
No, if he let them go,

82
00:05:12,798 --> 00:05:14,898
I'm sure it would've made the news,

83
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,798
so I'm sure he still has them.

84
00:05:16,798 --> 00:05:20,299
I wonder what the name of that businessman was?

85
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:22,598
Gonsaku Kojima.

86
00:05:22,598 --> 00:05:24,698
He's the chairman of the Kojima group

87
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:28,098
as well as the sponsor of this Mr. Kojima Contest.

88
00:05:28,098 --> 00:05:30,998
You mean the super rich Kojima group

89
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,311
that owns a lot of things

90
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:33,998
like railroads and department stores?

91
00:05:33,998 --> 00:05:38,998
Right. After losing two out of the three hanging scrolls,

92
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:41,698
it was no use holding on to just one,

93
00:05:41,698 --> 00:05:43,298
so it was written in the chairman's blog

94
00:05:43,298 --> 00:05:45,198
that he decided to set up this plan

95
00:05:45,198 --> 00:05:48,327
to give it to someone.

96
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:49,198
And if so, he wanted to give it to someone

97
00:05:49,198 --> 00:05:52,098
who had the same name as he, Kojima.

98
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:53,798
You're lucky you're a Kojima!

99
00:05:54,798 --> 00:05:57,798
Then, the letter asking you to make entry

100
00:05:57,798 --> 00:05:59,198
came directly to your house, Genta?

101
00:05:59,198 --> 00:06:02,098
No. We were invited to come by another Kojima

102
00:06:02,098 --> 00:06:03,498
who lives in the neighborhood.

103
00:06:03,498 --> 00:06:04,998
He told us that he saw Kojimas

104
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,698
being asked to come together on the internet,

105
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:09,598
so he asked my Dad to enter too.

106
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:13,298
Then, what do you have to do to win?

107
00:06:13,298 --> 00:06:15,598
A lot of stuff was written.

108
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:19,698
Physical endurance contest, singing contest

109
00:06:19,698 --> 00:06:22,798
and even a Kanji character dictation test.

110
00:06:22,798 --> 00:06:23,998
I see.

111
00:06:23,998 --> 00:06:27,698
He wants to choose a well-rounded almighty Mr. Kojima.

112
00:06:27,698 --> 00:06:29,598
Looks like it's going to be tough.

113
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:33,398
But, he can sing.

114
00:06:33,398 --> 00:06:36,375
He's far better than Conan.

115
00:06:37,298 --> 00:06:39,598
Hey, isn't that hurdle a bit too low?

116
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:42,381
Is your father going to be okay, Genta?

117
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:44,383
Nothing's for sure.

118
00:06:45,198 --> 00:06:48,387
Then, I guess the one who scores the highest

119
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:51,498
in all three of those matches will be the winner.

120
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:54,198
No, there's more to it.

121
00:06:54,198 --> 00:06:56,395
The ones who make it through

122
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:59,398
will all gather in Studio 5

123
00:06:59,398 --> 00:07:01,598
and the winner will be determined

124
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:05,498
after answering a quiz in front of the audience.

125
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:10,409
OK. All 5 will move.

126
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:12,411
I see, the final contest is going to be who answers

127
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:14,098
the fastest quiz contest.

128
00:07:17,798 --> 00:07:21,198
They're the Mr. Kojimas who are competing in the contest.

129
00:07:21,198 --> 00:07:23,298
How's the contest coming along?

130
00:07:23,298 --> 00:07:25,298
How's it going, oh bummers!

131
00:07:25,298 --> 00:07:26,425
The match is only about

132
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:29,798
how many push-ups you can do in three minutes.

133
00:07:29,798 --> 00:07:32,431
I really tried hard

134
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:35,898
and did 180 sit up but didn't make it.

135
00:07:35,898 --> 00:07:38,437
Well, anybody who makes it through

136
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:40,439
is a monster.

137
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:46,445
I'm sure your father'll do okay, though, Genta.

138
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:50,449
Yeah. He can do it hands down.

139
00:07:51,498 --> 00:07:55,698
There's a different group of Kojimas coming this way.

140
00:07:56,798 --> 00:07:59,398
I didn't think that I'd be disqualified singing.

141
00:07:59,398 --> 00:08:01,698
Well, it can't be helped

142
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:04,463
because even he who won successive awards

143
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:06,465
in singing contests didn't make it.

144
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:08,467
Don't get so depressed.

145
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:10,898
In order to make it through this contest,

146
00:08:10,898 --> 00:08:13,698
you've got to have the singing ability of Elvis Presley.

147
00:08:13,698 --> 00:08:16,475
Pruse Lee? Did he means the one that comes out in Kung-Fu movies.

148
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:18,477
That's Bruce Lee you're talking about.

149
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:21,798
They're talking about Elvis Presley,

150
00:08:21,798 --> 00:08:24,483
the King of Rock and Roll.

151
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:27,998
Is your father really going to be all right, Genta?

152
00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:31,898
Yeah. I think so.

153
00:08:31,898 --> 00:08:34,298
Darn! Why? How come?

154
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:36,298
Hey, cool it!

155
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:38,198
Yet another group.

156
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:39,898
Because don't you think it's funny?

157
00:08:39,898 --> 00:08:41,598
I've reached Level 1 in the kanji writing test, you know,

158
00:08:41,598 --> 00:08:44,898
so how could I flunk the kanji dictation test?

159
00:08:44,898 --> 00:08:47,398
I answered the test perfectly and yet.

160
00:08:47,398 --> 00:08:50,098
It's just that you didn't answer it perfectly.

161
00:08:50,098 --> 00:08:51,798
Then, can you write?

162
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:54,513
The kanji character for "rose" or "melancholy"?

163
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:56,515
Well, no.

164
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:59,998
Hey, Genta, your father...

165
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,298
He probably...

166
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:04,523
won't make it.

167
00:09:04,698 --> 00:09:06,525
The phone.

168
00:09:08,898 --> 00:09:10,298
It's from my Dad.

169
00:09:10,298 --> 00:09:12,298
What?

170
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:15,398
Hello. This is Genta.

171
00:09:16,798 --> 00:09:19,898
What? No joke?

172
00:09:19,898 --> 00:09:22,541
You made it to the three finalists?

173
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:23,798
Really?

174
00:09:23,798 --> 00:09:25,898
That's amazing.

175
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,598
Everybody's here rooting for you,

176
00:09:27,598 --> 00:09:29,898
so give it your best shot!

177
00:09:29,898 --> 00:09:32,551
But, it's strange.

178
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:36,098
There are 5 seats for the quick pushing quiz

179
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:39,598
and yet I wonder why only 3 people made it?

180
00:09:40,898 --> 00:09:43,898
"Evaluation Room" -Chairman Kojima.

181
00:09:43,898 --> 00:09:47,398
We got a complaint from the producer of the TV station,

182
00:09:47,398 --> 00:09:48,567
saying that the program is meaningless

183
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:49,698
the way things are going.

184
00:09:49,698 --> 00:09:52,198
"Gonsaku Kojima (71)" -Never mind.

185
00:09:52,198 --> 00:09:53,998
"Chairman of the Kojima Group" -By the way,

186
00:09:53,998 --> 00:09:56,998
did you show it to the three finalists?

187
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,098
I'm asking you if you showed them the paper

188
00:10:01,098 --> 00:10:03,298
that we secretly prepared?

189
00:10:03,298 --> 00:10:04,583
Oh, yes.

190
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:08,998
But, all three of them answered differently.

191
00:10:08,998 --> 00:10:10,589
Who cares.

192
00:10:10,798 --> 00:10:13,598
Tell me how they read it.

193
00:10:15,098 --> 00:10:19,398
"Bunta Kojima (33)" -Contestant number 35, Mr. Bunta Kojima's answer

194
00:10:19,398 --> 00:10:21,498
was "Hapyakuichi" (801).

195
00:10:21,498 --> 00:10:24,898
"Genji Kojima (32)" -Contestant number 84, Mr. Genji Kojima

196
00:10:24,898 --> 00:10:26,598
answered "Shakuhachi" (Bamboo flute).

197
00:10:26,598 --> 00:10:30,198
"Gankichi Kojima (34)" -Contestant number 147, Mr. Gankichi Kojima

198
00:10:30,198 --> 00:10:31,998
answered "Ippin" (First class).

199
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:37,598
Chairman?

200
00:10:37,598 --> 00:10:41,198
He's finally disclosed himself.

201
00:10:41,198 --> 00:10:42,621
Disclosed himself?

202
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:45,798
Using all that money was all worthwhile.

203
00:10:45,798 --> 00:10:46,998
What?

204
00:10:46,998 --> 00:10:48,627
Where's that paper now?

205
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:51,398
Oh, yes.

206
00:10:51,398 --> 00:10:53,198
Here in this envelope.

207
00:10:53,198 --> 00:10:54,633
Good.

208
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:56,398
I'll take care of everything from here.

209
00:10:56,398 --> 00:10:59,098
You may go now.

210
00:10:59,098 --> 00:11:01,398
But, chairman...

211
00:11:01,398 --> 00:11:04,643
I'm going in person

212
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:07,698
to the waiting room to welcome

213
00:11:07,698 --> 00:11:11,298
the honourable winner of the Mr. Kojima contest.

214
00:11:11,298 --> 00:11:12,998
"Nationwide Mr.Kojima Contest"

215
00:11:15,398 --> 00:11:16,655
It's almost time.

216
00:11:16,898 --> 00:11:20,298
I wish my Dad'll come out quickly.

217
00:11:20,298 --> 00:11:22,661
There he is.

218
00:11:22,898 --> 00:11:25,498
Isn't that the staff of Nichiuri TV?

219
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:27,398
I guess so.

220
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:31,598
We are very sorry to announce

221
00:11:31,598 --> 00:11:36,398
that this Mr. Kojima contest has been cancelled

222
00:11:36,398 --> 00:11:38,098
due to reasons on our side.

223
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,298
What?

224
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:42,681
-Hey! You've gotta be kidding! -What do you mean?

225
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:45,498
The stain on his sleeve...

226
00:11:45,498 --> 00:11:47,498
Isn't that a blood stain?

227
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:50,098
I'll go check.

228
00:11:50,098 --> 00:11:51,098
Conan?

229
00:11:51,098 --> 00:11:53,098
You guys stay where you are and don't move!

230
00:11:58,698 --> 00:12:00,699
Chairman!

231
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:02,698
Chairman? Chairman Kojima?

232
00:12:02,698 --> 00:12:05,198
Hey, did you call the ambulance?

233
00:12:05,198 --> 00:12:07,798
Yes. They should be here in 10 minutes.

234
00:12:07,798 --> 00:12:08,998
What happened?

235
00:12:08,998 --> 00:12:12,711
It seems he tripped and fell down the stairs.

236
00:12:15,498 --> 00:12:16,498
Did you see him fall?

237
00:12:16,498 --> 00:12:19,598
No, I heard a loud sound together with his scream,

238
00:12:19,598 --> 00:12:20,998
so I rushed over

239
00:12:20,998 --> 00:12:23,098
and found the chairman lying on the floor alone.

240
00:12:23,098 --> 00:12:26,098
Then, you'd better call the police too.

241
00:12:26,098 --> 00:12:29,898
-The police? -See, look at the chairman's right hand.

242
00:12:29,898 --> 00:12:32,498
He's holding a piece of paper.

243
00:12:32,498 --> 00:12:36,298
If a person is about to trip and fall from the stairs,

244
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,737
it's unnatural for the person to be holding the paper, wouldn't it?

245
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:40,198
When he was about to fall,

246
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:42,298
the chairman grabbed the piece of paper

247
00:12:42,298 --> 00:12:44,743
that the person who was next to him was holding.

248
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:47,898
Or he fought for the piece of paper with someone

249
00:12:47,898 --> 00:12:49,798
and mistakenly fell.

250
00:12:49,798 --> 00:12:51,098
I see.

251
00:12:51,098 --> 00:12:52,498
Where's the staff member that announced

252
00:12:52,498 --> 00:12:54,098
the contest would be cancelled a while ago?

253
00:12:54,098 --> 00:12:56,198
He seemed to have a blood stain on his sleeve.

254
00:12:56,198 --> 00:13:00,198
He rushed over to the chairman with us and tried to carry him up,

255
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:02,498
so maybe that's when the blood stained his sleeve.

256
00:13:02,498 --> 00:13:05,198
At any rate, when the chairman fell from the stairs,

257
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:07,798
someone should've been with him.

258
00:13:07,798 --> 00:13:09,798
And yet when you all rushed over to him,

259
00:13:09,798 --> 00:13:12,771
that person was gone together with the piece of paper,

260
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:14,773
means that it's almost unmistakable

261
00:13:14,998 --> 00:13:17,298
that the person was the cause of the fall and fled.

262
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:18,298
But...

263
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,779
Who are you?

264
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:22,098
Oh, well...

265
00:13:22,098 --> 00:13:24,783
Maybe that someone could be

266
00:13:24,998 --> 00:13:28,198
one of the three finalists.

267
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:31,598
The chairman said,

268
00:13:31,598 --> 00:13:33,798
"I'm going in person to the waiting room

269
00:13:33,798 --> 00:13:36,098
to welcome the honorable winner."

270
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:40,198
That's why I was waiting in another room together with the staff.

271
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:44,298
Hey... Don't tell me that the three finalists include...

272
00:13:44,298 --> 00:13:48,198
What's the entire racket here about?

273
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:54,598
Is anything the matter?

274
00:13:54,598 --> 00:13:56,298
I don't know what's going on,

275
00:13:56,298 --> 00:13:58,817
but I wish they'd hurry and let us do the last quiz?

276
00:13:58,998 --> 00:14:01,798
I'm tired of waiting already.

277
00:14:01,798 --> 00:14:04,498
Don't tell me that Genta's father

278
00:14:04,498 --> 00:14:06,598
is also considered one of the suspects too?

279
00:14:06,598 --> 00:14:11,198
Who among these three

280
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:13,898
is Genta's father?

281
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:25,735
The victim is Mr. Gonsaku Kojima, age 71.

282
00:14:25,735 --> 00:14:27,335
He's the chairman of the Kojima Group,

283
00:14:27,335 --> 00:14:29,435
and he seems to have come here today

284
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:33,335
to serve as the head judge for this special TV program.

285
00:14:33,335 --> 00:14:34,853
Head judge?

286
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:35,835
Yes.

287
00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:38,857
It's a program called "Nationwide Mr. Kojima Contest"

288
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:43,235
that Chairman Kojima himself planned and sponsored.

289
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:47,635
The winner was scheduled to receive a gorgeous award.

290
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:51,235
But from the looks of it, it looks like an accident

291
00:14:51,235 --> 00:14:54,635
in which he tripped and fell off the stairs.

292
00:14:58,435 --> 00:14:59,935
It seems that this is not something for us,

293
00:14:59,935 --> 00:15:02,135
the 1st division to cover.

294
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:03,835
I guess not.

295
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:05,735
Why'd you call us?

296
00:15:05,735 --> 00:15:07,635
You're the one who called

297
00:15:07,635 --> 00:15:10,889
asking to talk to me directly, aren't you?

298
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:12,635
-The paper. -Paper?

299
00:15:12,635 --> 00:15:14,893
When we the staff rushed over,

300
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:17,435
the Chairman was bleeding from his head,

301
00:15:17,435 --> 00:15:19,735
holding a piece of torn paper

302
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:21,335
and lying on the floor.

303
00:15:21,335 --> 00:15:23,835
When a person is about to fall off the stairs,

304
00:15:23,835 --> 00:15:25,835
do you think he'd hold a paper in his hand?

305
00:15:25,835 --> 00:15:27,435
No.

306
00:15:27,435 --> 00:15:29,735
So, when the chairman fell,

307
00:15:29,735 --> 00:15:31,235
there must've been someone near him,

308
00:15:31,235 --> 00:15:34,435
and he at the spur of the moment grabbed that piece of paper.

309
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:37,635
Or he fought for the paper with someone

310
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:40,635
and accidentally fell off the stairs, right?

311
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:43,535
But, when the Chairman was found lying on the floor

312
00:15:43,535 --> 00:15:46,035
there was no one near him,

313
00:15:46,035 --> 00:15:48,035
so we thought that maybe there was a person

314
00:15:48,035 --> 00:15:50,535
who left the chairman who fell off the way he is

315
00:15:50,535 --> 00:15:53,635
and ran off with the torn piece of paper.

316
00:15:53,635 --> 00:15:56,935
If so, we could have a case.

317
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:58,435
But, how amazing.

318
00:15:58,435 --> 00:15:59,435
To deduce things that far

319
00:15:59,435 --> 00:16:01,535
and call an officer of the 1st division.

320
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:06,035
Oh, it wasn't us,

321
00:16:06,035 --> 00:16:08,535
but rather that little boy who told us

322
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:10,635
to call Officer Takagi of the Metropolitan Police.

323
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:12,335
Are you sure you really don't know?

324
00:16:12,335 --> 00:16:14,535
You're the Chairman's secretary, aren't you?

325
00:16:14,535 --> 00:16:18,135
But I was told by the Chairman not to look at it, so...

326
00:16:18,135 --> 00:16:20,635
Conan?

327
00:16:20,635 --> 00:16:22,961
So, it's this pattern again.

328
00:16:23,135 --> 00:16:27,635
I really don't know what was written on that paper.

329
00:16:27,635 --> 00:16:30,635
Besides, I kept it for him in this envelope all the while.

330
00:16:31,935 --> 00:16:34,635
Are you referring to the paper

331
00:16:34,635 --> 00:16:37,735
that the Chairman was holding in his hand?

332
00:16:37,735 --> 00:16:39,735
Yes, Sir. Most probably...

333
00:16:39,735 --> 00:16:42,135
That paper is a Japanese paper

334
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:44,735
that the Chairman uses on special occasions.

335
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:46,985
I got a glimpse of the paper

336
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:50,335
when the chairman was putting it in the envelope.

337
00:16:50,335 --> 00:16:54,135
But, I only had that paper on me temporarily,

338
00:16:54,135 --> 00:16:57,635
and I gave it back to the chairman just before we parted,

339
00:16:57,635 --> 00:16:59,835
with the paper still in the envelope.

340
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:03,001
An empty envelope was found on the corpse,

341
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:04,535
so I believe he's telling the truth.

342
00:17:04,535 --> 00:17:07,005
But, why were holding it for him?

343
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,435
So that I could show it to the three.

344
00:17:09,435 --> 00:17:10,535
The three?

345
00:17:10,535 --> 00:17:13,835
The three finalists of the Mr. Kojima contest.

346
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:16,735
There they are.

347
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:19,017
Mr. Kojima contest?

348
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:21,535
By the way, how were they chosen?

349
00:17:21,535 --> 00:17:24,635
Mr. Kojima's nationwide were called upon on the net,

350
00:17:24,635 --> 00:17:25,835
and of all the people who entered,

351
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:27,025
the candidates were narrowed down to 200,

352
00:17:27,235 --> 00:17:30,235
who qualified to enter the contest.

353
00:17:30,235 --> 00:17:33,035
They had to compete doing exercise, such as the number of push ups

354
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:34,735
they could finish in three minutes.

355
00:17:34,735 --> 00:17:36,135
Sing songs in a singing contest

356
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:37,735
to test their singing ability,

357
00:17:37,735 --> 00:17:39,935
and compete in a kanji dictation test

358
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:42,235
to test their intelligence.

359
00:17:42,235 --> 00:17:43,635
I see.

360
00:17:43,635 --> 00:17:47,435
So, those three men have intelligence

361
00:17:47,435 --> 00:17:50,035
are physically fit and sing well.

362
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:51,935
Yes, in a way...

363
00:17:51,935 --> 00:17:53,635
In a way?

364
00:17:53,635 --> 00:17:56,135
And, what did he want you to do

365
00:17:56,135 --> 00:17:58,135
after showing the three

366
00:17:58,135 --> 00:17:59,735
the paper with the question on it?

367
00:17:59,735 --> 00:18:01,835
Well...

368
00:18:01,835 --> 00:18:03,835
He just simply wanted me

369
00:18:03,835 --> 00:18:06,835
to ask them how they read the kanji.

370
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,135
Oh, I see.

371
00:18:08,135 --> 00:18:11,069
But, all three answered differently.

372
00:18:11,235 --> 00:18:12,535
Differently?

373
00:18:12,535 --> 00:18:15,735
Was some kind of code written on it?

374
00:18:15,735 --> 00:18:19,335
No. All three answered almost immediately,

375
00:18:19,335 --> 00:18:22,035
so I don't think the words were all that difficult.

376
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:25,083
Contestant number 35, Mr. Bunta Kojima answered

377
00:18:25,335 --> 00:18:27,635
"Hapyakuichi" (801).

378
00:18:27,635 --> 00:18:30,835
Number 84, Mr. Genji Kojima answered

379
00:18:30,835 --> 00:18:33,091
"Shakuhachi" (Bamboo fluter).

380
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:37,095
And number 147, Mr. Gankichi Kojima

381
00:18:37,335 --> 00:18:40,635
answered "Ippin" (First class).

382
00:18:40,635 --> 00:18:43,535
The three truly did answer differently.

383
00:18:43,535 --> 00:18:46,335
Did you really show them all the same piece of paper?

384
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:48,735
Yes, I did.

385
00:18:48,735 --> 00:18:51,935
When I told the chairman what the answers of the three were,

386
00:18:51,935 --> 00:18:54,835
this is what he mumbled...

387
00:18:54,835 --> 00:18:58,435
He's finally disclosed his true self.

388
00:19:00,035 --> 00:19:01,435
Disclosed his true self?

389
00:19:01,435 --> 00:19:05,835
Then he took the envelope with the paper inside it from me

390
00:19:05,835 --> 00:19:09,935
and said that he was going to the waiting room in person

391
00:19:09,935 --> 00:19:12,435
to welcome the winner of the Mr. Kojima contest.

392
00:19:12,435 --> 00:19:14,135
I see. In other words,

393
00:19:14,135 --> 00:19:17,935
he chose the winner after hearing the answers of the finalists?

394
00:19:17,935 --> 00:19:19,835
Yes.

395
00:19:19,835 --> 00:19:20,935
But, it seems strange for him to say,

396
00:19:20,935 --> 00:19:24,835
"He's finally disclosed himself."

397
00:19:24,835 --> 00:19:28,635
And he went to the winner's waiting room?

398
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:32,035
Yes, he told me to leave,

399
00:19:32,035 --> 00:19:34,435
so I was in another room where the staff were

400
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:37,155
when I heard the chairman scream and a loud sound.

401
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:38,935
Inspector Megure!

402
00:19:38,935 --> 00:19:40,535
Oh, Chiba!

403
00:19:40,535 --> 00:19:42,135
I got this story

404
00:19:42,135 --> 00:19:44,835
from the others who entered this contest.

405
00:19:44,835 --> 00:19:46,335
The floor above these stairs

406
00:19:46,335 --> 00:19:49,935
is where the waiting room for the finalists of this contest is.

407
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:51,935
It seems that the only ones who were on that floor

408
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:55,635
when the chairman fell were the three finalists.

409
00:19:55,635 --> 00:19:58,435
Were all three in the same room?

410
00:19:58,435 --> 00:20:02,135
No, they were all in separate rooms of their own.

411
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:05,183
Moreover, the elevator to that floor was being checked at that time,

412
00:20:05,435 --> 00:20:09,187
so anyone who went outside used the stairs to go downstairs.

413
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:12,835
In other words, if when the staff rushed over,

414
00:20:12,835 --> 00:20:16,435
there was no one near the chairman who was lying on the floor,

415
00:20:16,435 --> 00:20:18,235
it's highly likely that one of the finalists

416
00:20:18,235 --> 00:20:20,935
after pushing the chairman off the stairs,

417
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:26,435
went back to his room again.

418
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:29,207
I guess we'll listen to what they have to say individually.

419
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:31,835
-Yes, sir! -Oh, Officer Takagi.

420
00:20:32,835 --> 00:20:34,335
When you listen to what they have to say,

421
00:20:34,335 --> 00:20:37,215
I'd like you to ask them several other things too.

422
00:20:37,435 --> 00:20:39,217
How unusual.

423
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:40,635
You usually come along secretly

424
00:20:40,635 --> 00:20:42,335
and ask them without asking for permission.

425
00:20:42,335 --> 00:20:44,535
Well, you see...

426
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,035
What is it?

427
00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:52,635
What? Genta's father is among the three?

428
00:20:52,635 --> 00:20:54,435
Which... which one is he?

429
00:20:54,435 --> 00:20:57,235
I don't know because I've never met him.

430
00:20:57,235 --> 00:21:02,135
Maybe he knows me by photos or something, though.

431
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:04,735
Then, I can find out right away if I ask.

432
00:21:04,735 --> 00:21:06,135
I'll talk to Inspector Megure

433
00:21:06,135 --> 00:21:07,935
and have him taken off the list of suspects.

434
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:10,535
No! Holmes also said,

435
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,335
"Emotional qualities at times

436
00:21:12,335 --> 00:21:16,535
can interfere deduction carrying you away from the truth".

437
00:21:16,535 --> 00:21:18,135
We can't be 100% sure that he's not a suspect

438
00:21:18,135 --> 00:21:21,735
just because he's Genta's father, can we?

439
00:21:21,735 --> 00:21:23,535
If you want to make a composed deduction,

440
00:21:23,535 --> 00:21:25,935
I don't think you should ask.

441
00:21:25,935 --> 00:21:29,835
So, could you ask them what I ask you to ask them, in my place?

442
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:31,735
Okay.

443
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:36,135
Maybe those three

444
00:21:36,135 --> 00:21:38,935
didn't really win their way through the contest.

445
00:21:38,935 --> 00:21:40,335
What?

446
00:21:43,281 --> 00:21:44,935
"Nationwide Mr. Kojima Contest"

447
00:21:44,935 --> 00:21:48,435
Conan sure is late, isn't he?

448
00:21:48,435 --> 00:21:51,635
-Yeah. -Maybe something happened after all.

449
00:21:51,635 --> 00:21:54,435
I can hear the sound of the ambulance and police cars.

450
00:21:54,435 --> 00:21:58,535
Then, shall we go to check out how things are?

451
00:21:58,535 --> 00:22:00,335
-Right! -Yes.

452
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:03,301
-Let's go... -Don't!

453
00:22:03,301 --> 00:22:07,305
Conan told you all to stay put right here, didn't he?

454
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:10,235
That's true, but...

455
00:22:10,235 --> 00:22:13,311
But if this is a homicide,

456
00:22:13,311 --> 00:22:16,835
Genta's father may be involved too.

457
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,235
That's why, the more so.

458
00:22:18,235 --> 00:22:20,535
If he just got mixed up in this,

459
00:22:20,535 --> 00:22:23,735
Conan would probably contact us saying not to worry,

460
00:22:23,735 --> 00:22:25,735
but if not...

461
00:22:25,735 --> 00:22:31,035
It's highly likely that he's also a suspect for something.

462
00:22:31,035 --> 00:22:33,331
Genta's father.

463
00:22:33,535 --> 00:22:35,635
What?

464
00:22:38,235 --> 00:22:40,035
Dad.

465
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,968
Next Conan's Hint:

466
00:24:03,968 --> 00:24:05,423
"Edoite"

467
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,644
My Dad is handsome, so he's not the culprit.

468
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,760
What kind of logic is that?

469
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,340
Really.
