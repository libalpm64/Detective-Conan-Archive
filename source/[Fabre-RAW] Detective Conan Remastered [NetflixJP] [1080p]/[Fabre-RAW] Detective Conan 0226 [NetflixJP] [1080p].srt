1
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,270
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,070
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,770
Today we visit the game center.

4
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,870
We'll be playing a case.

5
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,570
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,570
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,770
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,200
"Battle Game Trap (Part 1)"

9
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,600
Oh, no!

10
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,500
This is great!

11
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,200
Now I know why this one's your favourite, Sonoko!

12
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,700
Right?

13
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,200
And it's far from our school, so nobody knows about it.

14
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,800
Look!

15
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,900
There's a wedding version too!

16
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,400
I don't believe it. It wasn't here yesterday.

17
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,200
Let's have a look.

18
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,400
I think this one's so cute!

19
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,200
Why don't the three of us get our pictures taken here?

20
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,200
Wait... Just wait a minute!

21
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,000
Maybe it would be better to take separate pictures sometimes,

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,600
you know, for a change of pace.

23
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,400
Sonoko.

24
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,700
Confess, Sonoko.

25
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,700
You're going to write a letter to Mr. Kyogoku

26
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,700
and stick your picture on it, aren't you?

27
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,520
Just a few days ago,

28
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,820
Mr. Arade was reading a fan letter from one of the girls

29
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,120
and he asked if sticking your photo onto the letters

30
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,820
was the current trend.

31
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,020
Listen, Ran.

32
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,620
I think you're about the only one who isn't doing it.

33
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,820
Really?

34
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,120
Well, Mr. Arade has it rough, doesn't he?

35
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,220
He thought he could relax

36
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,820
when he was relieved as coach for basketball team

37
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,720
but now he's in charge of the drama club.

38
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,920
But I guess that can't be helped

39
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,020
since that handsome Shinichi's not around anymore,

40
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,420
all the girls are chasing Mr. Arade.

41
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,520
That's not completely true.

42
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,020
Miss Jody, the new English teacher is pretty popular too!

43
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,820
Only among the guys though!

44
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,520
She's always wearing such sexy clothes and excreting pheromone,

45
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,820
I think she thinks Japanese men are idiots!

46
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,120
Look who's talking, you always wear clothes that show your belly button.

47
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,220
But she explains everything simply and she is easy to understand!

48
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,320
She is just too serious, she has no fun!

49
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,720
She is always so quiet and proper.

50
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,720
She always refused us when we asked her for tea after class.

51
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,820
She acts like she is a very well-bred daughter of some blue blood family.

52
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,520
It's rare to have an American at school,

53
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,620
I expected her to be more outgoing and...

54
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,820
Hey! Come on!

55
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,420
Now!

56
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,420
Perfect!

57
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,520
Miss... Miss Jody.

58
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,520
What are you doing in a place like this?

59
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,720
Mouri and Suzuki!

60
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,520
What? A teacher?

61
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,420
Hey! Isn't that Teitan High's uniform?

62
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,420
Which means you're a high school teacher?

63
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,920
For goodness sakes!

64
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,520
No... you've made a mistake!

65
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,820
What?

66
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,720
What? You've been coming here every day after school?

67
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,920
You? Miss Jody?

68
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,020
Yes! The games here in Japan are very beautiful and exciting!

69
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,820
"Jody Santemillion (28)" -Of course, the games that come to the America

70
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,220
"English Teacher" -from Japan are very popular too!

71
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,020
There's always such a long line,

72
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,320
I never get to play!

73
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,220
That's why I became an English teacher.

74
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,420
That way, I can play the newest games every day!

75
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,020
She... she's a gamer.

76
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,920
You... you mean...

77
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,220
Your lessons are so serious is because...

78
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,220
Yes! If I make a mistake and get fired, it'd be "The End"!

79
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,920
It's very hard for foreigners to get jobs in Japan.

80
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,020
That's why you must not tell anyone I was here!

81
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,220
Please keep it our secret!

82
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,720
But you sure looked good!

83
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,520
That's right! You reminded me of Billy, the Kid!

84
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,220
If you think that was neat, do you want to try another great game?

85
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,320
It's the most popular fighting game in town now!

86
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,520
Great Fighter Spirit?

87
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,220
I've never heard of this one.

88
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,020
Just sit, go on!

89
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,820
First, put the headgear on,

90
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,420
insert coin and standby!

91
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,920
Play character is beginner level.

92
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,220
Are you ready?

93
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,920
When the right punch comes in lightly, go! Okay?

94
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,720
Okay!

95
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,820
Ready go!

96
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,520
-That hurt! -Ran?

97
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,220
That's right, this is a virtual reality fighting game,

98
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,520
the player actually feels the damage!

99
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,720
Is it too much for a girl to handle?

100
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,920
Hey... Ran, it's coming...

101
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,820
Hey...

102
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,720
You Win!

103
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,120
You did it.

104
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,420
She may not look it, but Ran won first place

105
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,820
in the State of Karate Championship Tournament!

106
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,120
Champion.

107
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,220
I'll kill you!

108
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,120
What is this? Someone's entered the game.

109
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,620
Why?

110
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,220
There's another player.

111
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,820
Another player is challenging you.

112
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,620
I don't believe it.

113
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,220
Be careful.

114
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,520
He is terrific.

115
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,520
He is beatable.

116
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,420
Fight!

117
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,420
You lose!

118
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,720
You are defeated.

119
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,720
This is so frustrating.

120
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,920
Now that you've lost, why don't you just get out of chair, young lady?

121
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,920
"Kengo Bito (21), Unemployed" -That gold seat is reserved for me.

122
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,520
What are you talking about?

123
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,220
Ran! Stay in that seat and try again,

124
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,520
it's payback time!

125
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,220
You're just wasting your time.

126
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,220
Besides the punch and kick mode,

127
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,820
he can manipulate all four control buttons

128
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,620
and create an undefeatable attack.

129
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,620
"Hitoshi Dejima (22)" -Today's the first time you've ever tried the game,

130
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,620
"Store Worker" -you don't stand a chance of winning.

131
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,140
Hey!

132
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,440
What's taking you so long!

133
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,440
This seat's built just for me.

134
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,040
What a creep. Who is he anyway?

135
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,840
He's known as "The Shisa of Beika" and it's gone to his head

136
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,340
but he's just your neighbourhood hoodlum.

137
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,840
What?

138
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,240
"Toshitsugu Emori (41)" -He's been getting cockier lately

139
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,640
"Taxi Driver" -and making things hard for the rest of us.

140
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,440
By the way, miss.

141
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,040
Your moves are big.

142
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,440
It may be called fighting, but it's only a game,

143
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,040
you don't need strength.

144
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,340
See? Watch him!

145
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,740
His movements are small,

146
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,140
he doesn't even look like he's fighting, does he?

147
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,840
You were watching? You watched us fight?

148
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,340
That's right, on that big monitor.

149
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,140
There's usually a tape playing on it

150
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:13,540
but when there's a challenge is made, the game's shown.

151
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,740
I figure the only person who can beat him. Haido City's invincible.

152
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,440
"Lutus from Haido".

153

"Takayasu Shimizu (30), Game Magazine Writer" -I'm the only one, right?

154
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,340
I've been waiting for you!

155
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,840
Let's continue our fight.

156
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,840
Give me a second. Let me smoke a cigarette first.

157
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,140
Miss Jody, let's get out of this place.

158
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,140
-Why? -She's right,

159
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,440
this isn't the only game arcade.

160
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,440
All right, please let me play this racing game one more time!

161
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,940
-Good grief! -Goodness!

162
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,740
You're good.

163
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,040
Do it!

164
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,040
I bet you're going to be the high scorer!

165

Fight!

167
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,540
Those two have started to fight!

168
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,140
Forget about those two.

169
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,640
But it looks...

170
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,340
What a barrage.

171
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,540
Who's winning?

172
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,740
There's no hit point gauge on that thing.

173
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:38,140
I think the more damage you suffer, the bluer your face gets.

174
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,940
The guy who beat me is winning so far.

175
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,840
Again.

176
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,240
It's amazing.

177
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,940
Down!

178
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,340
That special combination really did the job.

179
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,640
That "Lutus from Haido" is not so hot.

180
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,640
I don't think he can get up.

181
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,740
No, he is going to deliver the finishing touch before he gets up.

182
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,640
Hey, what's he doing?

183
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,640
He's got to finish him off quick, time's running out.

184
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,340
Draw!

185
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,940
Gosh, what a dummy.

186
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:25,640
It would've been an easy win if he'd finished him off right then.

187
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,440
Hey, something's wrong.

188
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,640
He's...

189
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,140
He's dead.

190
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,370
-Seriously? -He died while playing a game?

191
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,070
Are you sure about that?

192
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,570
Yes.

193
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,970
We were all watching their game on the monitor.

194
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,670
He was on the verge of winning,

195
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,970
but he stopped attacking all of a sudden.

196
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,670
When we looked...

197
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:11,670
The man working the character had stopped too.

198
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,270
The deceased is Kengo Bito, 21 years old,

199
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,170
presently unemployed.

200
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,270
He is quite rude by nature

201
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:24,070
and his reputation at this arcade isn't good.

202
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,970
I see, so he was a man with many enemies.

203
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,670
Mouri, do you know this man?

204
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:35,070
Yes, he's my father's former boss.

205
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,870
This is our school's English teacher!

206
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,670
English teacher?

207
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,870
Yes!

208
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,270
My name is Jody Santemillion!

209
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,770
I'm pleased to meet you!

210
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,870
My name is Juzo Megure!

211
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,270
I am a Japanese policyman!

212
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,370
Policy?

213
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,870
Not policyman! Policeman!

214
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,670
Policyman?

215
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,270
No...

216
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,270
Policeman, okay?

217
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,670
Policeman?

218
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,370
Inspector.

219
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,170
Yes, the question is why he died during the game.

220
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,170
Yes.

221
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,470
We questioned the other customers,

222
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:25,070
no one noticed anyone suspicious wandering around.

223
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:30,270
And it doesn't appear Mr. Bito drank or ate anything while he was playing

224
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,870
so that rules out suicide.

225
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,870
What's with this get-up anyway?

226
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:40,670
It looks like something from a Science Fiction movie.

227
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:44,070
It's a virtual reality game.

228
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:48,670
The damage inflicted by your opponent shows on screen

229
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,670
and at the same time, the player feels it too.

230
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,070
The player feels the damage?

231
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,370
Yes, on top of that,

232
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,270
if your opponent hits or kicks you from over the guards,

233
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:04,970
the feels a slight sensation in the arm or leg

234
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,070
so it seems like you're actually in a fight.

235
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,970
Hey, you don't mean...

236
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:16,270
the cause of his death is because the damage was too much.

237
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,270
No.

238
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,670
That would never happen.

239
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,670
All you feel is a light vibration.

240
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,070
You know, like the vibration mode on those cellular phones.

241
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,270
You can't kill someone with only that much, can you?

242
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,670
And who are you?

243
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,670
I'm the guy that fellow was playing against

244
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,670
just before he died.

245
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,670
I thought I'd better come over before you make me out to be the murderer.

246
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,270
Besides, I don't like to admit this

247
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:46,270
but I'm the one who was taking the beating.

248
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:50,570
I only got a couple of punches in.

249
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,470
And I was even chewing gum to help my rhythm,

250
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,270
but it didn't help.

251
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,170
Is that true?

252
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,870
Yes.

253
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:04,570
It did seem like he was taking the brunt of beating.

254
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,410
Then what could have killed him?

255
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:13,110
Yes, and there doesn't seem to any wound.

256
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,410
Maybe it was poison.

257
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:15,710
What?

258
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,810
See? This man looks like he died of suffocation

259
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,110
but it doesn't look like he was strangled!

260
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,410
It would have to be poison, wouldn't it?

261
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:30,410
But Conan, this man died while he was playing a game.

262
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,010
And there's no indication he ate or drank anything,

263
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,010
if he had been poisoned before the game,

264
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,810
he would have looked sick

265
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:42,610
or at least felt sick, isn't that right?

266
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,610
Did you notice anything like that?

267
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,810
No, I didn't notice anything.

268
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,510
Just before that game,

269
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,410
he was very actively giving Ran a good beating.

270
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:56,710
But if you put the poison in a syringe and injected...

271
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,410
If someone tried to do that,

272
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,010
he would have gotten angry and yelled.

273
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,810
And the other customers would have heard that.

274
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,310
Really?

275
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,110
Yes...

276
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:13,110
But Inspector, have you forgotten?

277
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,210
This is a game arcade, isn't it?

278
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:18,410
All the machines are off now and everything's quiet,

279
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,210
but usually, the place is filled with all kinds of sounds,

280
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,710
it's so noisy, you can't even hear yourself talk!

281
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:26,910
And this man's arms and legs are attached to the machine,

282
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,710
I don't think he could have moved very well.

283
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,510
And these arcades are kept kind of dark

284
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,010
so that the screens are easier to see.

285
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,910
I see, the victim was practically unprotected

286
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,710
and even if he yelled,

287
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,710
all the noise would have drowned out his voice.

288
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,510
And in the dark room,

289
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:50,310
with most of the other customers watching the monitor,

290
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,510
is would be possible to poison him.

291
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:57,210
All right, let's have the body taken to the coroner's for an autopsy!

292
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,710
Our first objective is to determine the cause of death!

293
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,810
Yes, sir...

294
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,610
Now to narrow down the list of suspects.

295
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,810
It's going to be quite a job,

296
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,910
finding the killer among the nearly 30 people who were here.

297
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:19,810
I know who went close to the man who died!

298
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:24,010
-What? -Just until before he died,

299
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:29,110
we were watching Miss Jody playing that racing game there!

300
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,110
Right?

301
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,310
And then? Who went close to him?

302
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,310
That man who works here

303
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,910
and that tall man!

304
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,810
And including the four of us, that makes six.

305
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:47,810
Isn't that right, Miss Jody?

306
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:48,810
Yes!

307
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,510
But this little boy isn't the only one who was watching everything!

308
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,910
What...

309
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,910
He's the other one.

310
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,810
A security camera!

311
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:07,810
By chance, would everything be on that camera?

312
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,110
Sure.

313
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:14,510
Then can we view it right away along with the six others?

314
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,510
Of course.

315
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,110
This way. Follow me.

316
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,510
Will you all please come along?

317
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,310
What's that?

318
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,010
What's making this sound?

319
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:33,010
It sounds like something metal is hitting something.

320
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,510
Like it's rubbing something.

321
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,410
What is it?

322
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,310
Here it is! Around here.

323
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:47,610
The victim took his seat about.

324
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:51,310
See? There we are getting chased out of our seats.

325
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,810
Isn't that you, Mr. Dejima?

326
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,710
What were you doing?

327
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:01,110
I was collecting the money in the machines.

328
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,030
Now it's Mr. Shimizu.

329
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,030
You seem to be having a conversation.

330
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,430
What were you talking about?

331
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:14,030
I was trying to get him to tell me his strategy before the game,

332
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,930
but it was no use.

333
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:20,030
What's this? What did you crouch and pick up?

334
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,830
I dropped my lighter and was just picking it up.

335
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,230
And then the game started.

336
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,130
Inspector!

337
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,630
Mr. Dejima is...

338
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,730
He's holding something in his hand?

339
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,730
A video recorder?

340
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:37,930
Yes, it was such a great game, I thought I'd tape it.

341
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:41,130
Hey, do I know you from someplace?

342
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:44,030
No, you're probably mistaken.

343
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,830
You're right, it really is something.

344
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:50,030
The blows keep coming.

345
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:54,730
Ran, you and your friends left the racing game partway through.

346
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,330
Yes, the fight was so exciting,

347
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,730
we started to watch that.

348
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:05,730
That means Miss Jody and the victim were left alone.

349
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:09,230
But I was very busy playing the game,

350
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,030
I didn't even notice everybody left!

351
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:16,030
But still, you need someone to verified your story.

352
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:19,330
It's true, Miss Jody never left her game!

353
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:23,330
When we ran up to the body, she had just reached the goal

354
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,230
and her score was the highest scored ever!

355
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,630
Then she's in the clear.

356
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,230
No one can score the highest score unless they concentrate

357
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,030
and keep their hands on the wheel,

358
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:36,430
that racing game's not easy.

359
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:40,030
Then who killed him?

360
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,030
Hey!

361
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:46,030
This man who just came out from behind the victim.

362
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:50,030
Who in the world is that guy?

363
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:53,230
Isn't that the man who was playing mahjong?

364
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,030
That's the man who was bad mouthing the man who died!

365
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:00,030
What? Bring this man here right now!

366
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,230
Yes, sir!

367
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,530
Judging from the condition of the body,

368
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:09,130
I'm positive he was poisoned.

369
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:12,930
Which means, that person is the most suspicious

370
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,930
and the evidence is probably in there.

371
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:19,130
All that leaves are the needle or hypodermic syringe,

372
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,730
nothing like that was on the floor.

373
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:26,830
I doubt the killer would still be holding on to it.

374
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,930
The killer...

375
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:34,230
Where did the killer hide the weapon?

376
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,360
Next Conan's hint:

377
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,900
"Shoe"

378
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,000
In next week's episode, the crime is solved!

379
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,840
Does that mean...

380
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,140
Could it be I'm a brilliant detective?
