1
00:00:02,796 --> 00:00:06,296
We leave on Dr. Agasa's car to go camping,

2
00:00:06,296 --> 00:00:09,989
but we run out of gas and are stalled.

3
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:11,991
We seek help from Mr. Goki Sudo

4
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:14,696
who happens to pass by in a classic car,

5
00:00:14,696 --> 00:00:17,596
but he makes a rude remark and goes off.

6
00:00:21,096 --> 00:00:22,496
Soon afterwards,

7
00:00:22,496 --> 00:00:24,896
an explosion occurs at the villa at the top of the mountain.

8
00:00:25,996 --> 00:00:27,796
When I ran over there,

9
00:00:27,796 --> 00:00:30,996
I saw Mr. Sudo's classic car up in flames

10
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:33,796
and his fiance, Ena Ginbayashi, shouting his name

11
00:00:33,796 --> 00:00:36,015
and breaking out in tears.

12
00:00:37,096 --> 00:00:39,396
At first, it looked to be a very unfortunate accident.

13
00:00:39,396 --> 00:00:42,021
But I was suspicious of Ena's attitude.

14
00:00:43,196 --> 00:00:46,596
Could it be a murder that Ena set up?

15
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:52,031
No igniting device was found at the site,

16
00:00:52,196 --> 00:00:53,796
but there's got to be something!

17
00:00:55,796 --> 00:00:58,037
A trick that can be used

18
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:00,696
to set the garage on fire without using an igniting device.

19
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:04,043
A catch-22 crisis is gracefully revived.

20
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:06,596
The table is turned and the mystery solved!

21
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:08,047
An explosion occurs where there is nothing to start a fire.

22
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:10,049
The secret behind a trick filled with hate.

23
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:12,051
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:14,053
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:15,796
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

26
00:02:52,768 --> 00:02:56,168
"Blue Sparks of Hate (Part 2)".

27
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,868
Then, well, leaving the cigarettes aside.

28
00:03:08,868 --> 00:03:11,368
"Ena Ginbayashi (31), Sudo's fiance" -Let's hear where and what

29
00:03:11,368 --> 00:03:15,168
all of you were doing when Mr. Sudo came to this villa?

30
00:03:15,168 --> 00:03:16,968
What?

31
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:20,468
We were all gathered in the room playing a game.

32
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:21,668
Game?

33
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,968
King game!

34
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:25,168
You don't know that game?

35
00:03:25,168 --> 00:03:28,187
You make pieces of paper with the seal of a King and a number on it.

36
00:03:28,368 --> 00:03:30,768
The person who draws the paper with the King on it

37
00:03:30,768 --> 00:03:34,468
has certain commands written on it like "number 13 kiss number 4".

38
00:03:34,468 --> 00:03:37,868
Was there anyone that wasn't in this room

39
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:40,199
when Mr. Sudo came here?

40
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,868
I think everybody was here.

41
00:03:41,868 --> 00:03:43,468
If anyone went to the restroom,

42
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:44,868
we stopped the game

43
00:03:44,868 --> 00:03:47,268
and waited for that person to come back.

44
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:50,768
But if the owner of the house Mr. Sudo got here,

45
00:03:50,768 --> 00:03:53,768
it's only natural that someone would go out to greet him, right?

46
00:03:53,768 --> 00:03:57,068
No, we didn't realize that he came back.

47
00:03:57,068 --> 00:04:01,068
The garage door opens by remote controller from inside the car.

48
00:04:01,068 --> 00:04:04,223
We had the BGM on pretty loud too.

49
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:06,668
Then we heard a big boom

50
00:04:06,668 --> 00:04:08,668
and went to look outside.

51
00:04:08,668 --> 00:04:10,868
And found that the garage was on fire.

52
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:15,168
Which means that even if there were to be an igniting device,

53
00:04:15,168 --> 00:04:17,568
nobody could've operated it

54
00:04:17,568 --> 00:04:20,968
or calculate the timing to set it off?

55
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:21,968
No.

56
00:04:21,968 --> 00:04:23,468
Not possible.

57
00:04:23,468 --> 00:04:28,668
But why was the poly tank so unfortunately knocked over?

58
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,368
I think it was him.

59
00:04:31,368 --> 00:04:35,968
This golden retriever that my late father bought for me.

60
00:04:35,968 --> 00:04:37,168
She so mischievous

61
00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:39,868
and has a habit of knocking things over.

62
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:44,568
That's why I told him not to store gasoline in a poly tank.

63
00:04:44,568 --> 00:04:49,468
But I didn't think that the same thing would happen three times.

64
00:04:49,468 --> 00:04:50,968
Did something like this happen before too?

65
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:55,268
Yeah, we had a party last week and the previous week too,

66
00:04:55,268 --> 00:04:56,668
but when Sudo came,

67
00:04:56,668 --> 00:04:58,868
the poly tank was knocked over.

68
00:04:58,868 --> 00:05:03,068
He was really angry saying, "Who the hell did this?"

69
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:05,568
After he found out that Ena's dog did it,

70
00:05:05,568 --> 00:05:07,368
he got in a big fight with Ena too.

71
00:05:08,068 --> 00:05:13,368
They fought over everything from Sudo's car, to clothes...

72
00:05:13,368 --> 00:05:15,968
So, the party was finished right then and there.

73
00:05:15,968 --> 00:05:17,468
Was that two weeks ago?

74
00:05:17,468 --> 00:05:19,968
Yes, last week

75
00:05:19,968 --> 00:05:23,668
I think they fought over Sudo stopping by somewhere before coming here.

76
00:05:23,668 --> 00:05:26,305
Who cares about something like that already!

77
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:27,468
Sorry.

78
00:05:29,468 --> 00:05:32,311
He died because

79
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:36,668
he didn't listen to me.

80
00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:42,968
It all adds up to that's only how much he cared for me.

81
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,768
That's all there is to it.

82
00:05:47,368 --> 00:05:48,327
There!

83
00:05:49,668 --> 00:05:52,331
It's a tank of gasoline I had one of the men bring.

84
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:54,068
Thanks so much!

85
00:05:54,068 --> 00:05:56,335
So, if there's anything more I want to ask you,

86
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:57,868
I'll call you.

87
00:05:57,868 --> 00:05:58,968
Okay.

88
00:06:00,368 --> 00:06:03,268
That boy wearing glasses is nowhere around.

89
00:06:03,268 --> 00:06:04,968
He's over there!

90
00:06:04,968 --> 00:06:08,368
Please tell me!

91
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,868
About the fight the two had last week and the week before!

92
00:06:11,868 --> 00:06:14,353
I mean, talk about persistent! I already told you!

93
00:06:14,568 --> 00:06:17,568
The week before last they got into a fight over the car and clothes.

94
00:06:17,568 --> 00:06:21,168
But what made them fight over something like that?

95
00:06:21,168 --> 00:06:22,868
Beats me,

96
00:06:22,868 --> 00:06:26,068
probably because Ena told Sudo to come with his classic car,

97
00:06:26,068 --> 00:06:29,268
but he showed up with a new model car?

98
00:06:29,268 --> 00:06:31,868
Or, maybe because Goki didn't come to the party

99
00:06:31,868 --> 00:06:34,668
with the clothes that Ena bought for him just for the party?

100
00:06:34,668 --> 00:06:36,375
What kind of clothes was it?

101
00:06:36,568 --> 00:06:38,377
What kind?

102
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:41,468
Remember, when you ran into Goki a while ago,

103
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:43,268
I think he was wearing it too,

104
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:45,968
a white wool sweater and a fleece jacket.

105
00:06:45,968 --> 00:06:49,168
The sweater's the one that Ena bought for him.

106
00:06:49,168 --> 00:06:51,868
Sudo wore the fleece ever since he established his company,

107
00:06:51,868 --> 00:06:53,968
because he really liked it,

108
00:06:53,968 --> 00:06:56,868
but he didn't like wool.

109
00:06:56,868 --> 00:06:58,397
But last week,

110
00:06:58,397 --> 00:07:00,399
when he came here, he was wearing the wool sweater, right?

111
00:07:00,568 --> 00:07:02,401
He was also riding the classic car.

112
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:07,068
But when she saw that Goki was holding a PET bottle of mineral water

113
00:07:07,068 --> 00:07:09,768
Ena got angry saying,

114
00:07:09,768 --> 00:07:12,411
"How dare you dilly-dally at a convenience store

115
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:14,413
despite knowing everyone is waiting!"

116
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:15,468
Goki was seriously angry saying,

117
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,417
"It's nobody's business where I stop over!"

118
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:21,068
Then, the wine that Ena was holding

119
00:07:21,068 --> 00:07:23,268
splattered onto Goki's sweater.

120
00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:25,368
And Ena started apologizing and crying

121
00:07:25,368 --> 00:07:28,427
saying that she'd buy him a new one,

122
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:31,368
so the party kind of drained away last week too.

123
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,668
But it's strange.

124
00:07:33,668 --> 00:07:38,068
Ena used to say before that she hated classic cars and yet...

125
00:07:39,568 --> 00:07:43,668
The classic car, a wool sweater.

126
00:07:43,668 --> 00:07:45,268
Stopping over...

127
00:07:45,268 --> 00:07:47,268
Wait a sec, this is...

128
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,768
The investigation's over.

129
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:57,768
So, leave the rest up to the police

130
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,768
and go enjoy camping.

131
00:07:59,768 --> 00:08:02,068
Yes, sir.

132
00:08:02,068 --> 00:08:03,668
See you.

133
00:08:04,868 --> 00:08:07,068
Enjoy? No way.

134
00:08:07,068 --> 00:08:09,468
Because we're concerned about the incident.

135
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:11,768
So we can't possibly enjoy ourselves.

136
00:08:11,768 --> 00:08:14,968
Hey, Shinichi. Can't you solve the case yet?

137
00:08:14,968 --> 00:08:18,268
No, I know I'm almost there, but...

138
00:08:19,468 --> 00:08:21,068
I don't care what,

139
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:23,668
but why don't we talk after getting in the car?

140
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:24,768
I guess so.

141
00:08:24,768 --> 00:08:26,485
Besides, it's getting a bit chilly too.

142
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:30,489
Boy, go ahead and get in the car then!

143
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:33,168
I hate to say this, but open the door for me then.

144
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:36,495
You'd better cut it, girl!

145
00:08:36,668 --> 00:08:38,268
Just who the hell do you think you are?

146
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,868
Open the door! Please...

147
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:45,468
Don't tell me that you're...

148
00:08:47,768 --> 00:08:48,968
Please.

149
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,868
Okay, I'll teach you a good way then!

150
00:08:58,868 --> 00:09:00,168
If it's before you get in the car,

151
00:09:00,168 --> 00:09:01,968
touch the asphalt pavement,

152
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:04,168
and if it's the door knob, touch the wall.

153
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,525
I didn't ask you that question, did I?

154
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:09,068
I'm telling you to open the door for me!

155
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:11,568
Try it.

156
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:12,531
While you're at it,

157
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:14,533
maybe opening your hands wide like this...

158
00:09:18,068 --> 00:09:19,268
Opening your hands wide?

159
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:21,068
You mean, stone, paper, scissors?

160
00:09:21,068 --> 00:09:23,868
I see. That's why...

161
00:09:24,968 --> 00:09:26,968
it's the classic car.

162
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:30,549
That's why Ena

163
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:33,068
didn't want him to stop by anywhere.

164
00:09:35,168 --> 00:09:39,268
She had schemed to make Mr. Sudo himself

165
00:09:39,268 --> 00:09:41,368
the ignition device!

166
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:44,868
The police officer said just a while ago too!

167
00:09:44,868 --> 00:09:46,568
That the gasoline poly tank

168
00:09:46,568 --> 00:09:48,868
that happened to be in the garage was knocked over

169
00:09:48,868 --> 00:09:52,068
and the gasoline vaporized, filling the garage.

170
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:54,268
And when Sudo got out of the car,

171
00:09:54,268 --> 00:09:55,968
holding a cigarette in his mouth

172
00:09:55,968 --> 00:09:57,668
in the garage filled with evaporated gasoline,

173
00:09:57,668 --> 00:09:59,668
it caught fire and exploded, right?

174
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:01,768
It's obviously an accident!

175
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:05,568
And yet, why do we have to continue being interrogated further?

176
00:10:05,568 --> 00:10:09,068
No, the person that the police wants to interrogate

177
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:12,968
is you, Mr. Goki Sudo's fiance,

178
00:10:12,968 --> 00:10:17,168
only you, Ms. Ena Ginbayashi!

179
00:10:17,168 --> 00:10:20,868
The thing about the poly tank with the gasoline inside being knocked over

180
00:10:20,868 --> 00:10:22,601
for three weeks straight

181
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:25,768
really seems to bug this boy and he wants to ask you questions.

182
00:10:25,768 --> 00:10:27,968
He won't take no for an answer.

183
00:10:29,168 --> 00:10:30,609
Not this brat again!

184
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:32,268
What is it with you?

185
00:10:32,268 --> 00:10:36,168
I just told the Inspector to ask her a small question.

186
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,617
It may be that someone

187
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:42,068
deliberately knocked the poly tank over after all.

188
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:45,468
Well, I just want to ask you a bit more things.

189
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,627
I guess I've got no choice.

190
00:10:48,868 --> 00:10:51,568
I've got to go to the police and tell them

191
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:55,068
that there're no bad people like that here.

192
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:58,068
But I don't want to take the police car.

193
00:10:58,068 --> 00:11:00,639
It's like I'm being arrested or something,

194
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,768
so I'll take my car.

195
00:11:01,768 --> 00:11:03,268
Oh, right!

196
00:11:04,168 --> 00:11:05,768
Since we're the last ones who saw Mr. Sudo,

197
00:11:05,768 --> 00:11:08,647
we're also being summoned by the police.

198
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:11,968
So, why don't we all go in our car?

199
00:11:13,568 --> 00:11:16,268
Okay.

200
00:11:16,268 --> 00:11:19,068
You came with quite a number of people, didn't you?

201
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:20,659
I wonder if I can ride together?

202
00:11:20,868 --> 00:11:24,368
It'll be fine! Don't worry about them.

203
00:11:24,368 --> 00:11:27,668
They're all absorbed in that car over there, so...

204
00:11:27,668 --> 00:11:29,968
Are you really letting us ride a police car?

205
00:11:29,968 --> 00:11:31,568
I'm honored!

206
00:11:32,868 --> 00:11:36,068
But I guess not, after all.

207
00:11:36,068 --> 00:11:38,168
I'll take my car.

208
00:11:38,168 --> 00:11:41,068
Oh, that's too bad.

209
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:43,968
I had something I wanted to show you.

210
00:11:45,568 --> 00:11:47,268
Something you want me to see?

211
00:11:47,268 --> 00:11:50,689
Yep! I picked it up on my way here to the villa.

212
00:11:50,868 --> 00:11:52,468
It belongs to Mr. Sudo.

213
00:11:52,468 --> 00:11:55,768
I haven't shown the police officers it yet either.

214
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:59,568
Don't you want to see it?

215
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:02,701
Yes, well, sort of.

216
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,170
How do you like this car?

217
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,470
Pretty good, don't you think?

218
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,170
Well, to say nothing of comfortable riding,

219
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,970
the shape is cute.

220
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,719
What's this car called?

221
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:23,270
It's called the Beetle,

222
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,070
because it looks like the insect.

223
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,727
Come to think of it, it does look similar.

224
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:30,170
Oh, mail?

225
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,270
Yep, to my friend!

226
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,270
Because we're finally in the cell phone service range area.

227
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,670
After you finish mailing,

228
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,470
will you show it to me?

229
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,370
His thing that you say you picked up.

230
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,570
Okay.

231
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,970
This!

232
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:52,070
This is the emblem of Goki's car.

233
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,170
Do you know about it?

234
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,170
Yes.

235
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:02,170
It was on the nose of Goki's classic car.

236
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,763
Are you sure it's really from his car?

237
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,770
Yep, after the explosion,

238
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:11,770
it was found on the road below the villa, after it came flying to us.

239
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,470
But...

240
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,470
you don't like classic cars, right?

241
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:30,470
If so, why did you ask Mr. Sudo to come in that car?

242
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,170
I... I began to like it

243
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,793
after being influenced by him.

244
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:38,797
Besides, it seems that Mr. Sudo didn't like wool

245
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:42,070
and yet why did you make him wear a wool sweater before coming here?

246
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,470
Because... because I thought he'd look good in it.

247
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:49,170
All he ever used to wear was fleece, so...

248
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,070
Come to think of it,

249
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,470
you're wearing a wool sweater and fleece jacket today too, aren't you, Ai?

250
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,815
So, what?

251
00:13:56,815 --> 00:14:00,819
Well, I just thought I'd ask.

252
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:04,823
Then, this is the only thing that you picked up, Sonny?

253
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:06,825
Yep, that's right.

254
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:10,070
Did you think it was something else?

255
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,170
No, not really.

256
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,470
Out of gas again.

257
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,270
Oh, boy. The officer just brought you

258
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,770
some gasoline to put into your car just a while ago and yet...

259
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,970
What now?

260
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,845
There aren't any service stations around here, either.

261
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:28,847
Then, why don't we go to your house to get some?

262
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,670
You had a can of gasoline in your garage, didn't you?

263
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,770
Oh, that's right!

264
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,853
There are some that I bought in order to go camping

265
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,370
and forgot to load in car.

266
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:41,170
Sorry, but I hope you don't mind us stopping by at Doc's house.

267
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,470
Sure.

268
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:56,470
I'm sorry. One moment, please.

269
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,770
There it is!

270
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,370
This is it.

271
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,895
Just what do you think you're doing?

272
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:23,970
The gasoline tank being knocked down in the garage

273
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:28,070
is just like the garage of the villa that caught fire just a while ago.

274
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:28,907
Yes.

275
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,670
But we'll be fine

276
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,911
because there's nobody who smokes here.

277
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:34,913
I... I see.

278
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:36,570
I'm sorry, Ai,

279
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,870
but could you get me the towel that's in the trunk?

280
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,921
You can open it with the car key.

281
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,570
Gosh, he is so hopeless.

282
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,570
Hey...

283
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:50,929
No!

284
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:58,937
No! Don't put the key inside!

285
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,939
Static will cause sparks of fire!

286
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,670
So, static was the ignition device after all.

287
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:21,370
Your remark just now cleared everything.

288
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,970
You made Mr. Sudo wear a combination of clothes

289
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,770
that would accumulate a lot of static fleece and wool.

290
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:32,070
You also made him come a long way by car to that villa garage

291
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,770
that was filled with evaporated gasoline.

292
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,670
When Mr. Sudo got off the car,

293
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,270
the moment he inserted the key into the keyhole

294
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,970
in order to lock the door,

295
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,370
static caused sparks of fire which ignited the gasoline...

296
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:51,770
and that was the set up that burned him to death.

297
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,270
When you're driving,

298
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:58,470
your back rubs against the seat, causing static to build up.

299
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:03,001
Moreover, the motive of why you had him come with his classic car

300
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:06,670
is because recent cars are usually equipped with keyless remote controllers

301
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,270
that when you lock the door,

302
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,009
you don't need to insert the key into the keyhole.

303
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:15,013
In other words, you don't have to touch overcharged static

304
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:18,270
caused by metal against metal.

305
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:23,021
But there are times that static causes only a prickly feeling, right?

306
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,670
I wonder if it would give off sparks of fire so conveniently.

307
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,027
It's true that just once won't do it,

308
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,470
but if you were planning to do it until sparks of fire would occur one day,

309
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,070
you're sure to succeed someday!

310
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,670
You seem to have actually tried it

311
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,070
three weeks in a row already, right?

312
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,470
The week before last, static didn't occur

313
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,570
because Mr. Sudo wasn't wearing a wool sweater

314
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,570
and came with a new model car.

315
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,570
Last week, you didn't succeed because Mr. Sudo stopped over

316
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,053
at the convenience store to buy a drink.

317
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:58,170
Once you get out of the car and touch something,

318
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:01,370
the static that built up until then flows out.

319
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:04,570
So, even if you put the key in the keyhole of the car,

320
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:07,370
it wouldn't be enough to create sparks of fire.

321
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:12,170
And then you got into a fight and soiled his sweater with wine

322
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:15,870
in order make him take off his sweater as soon as possible.

323
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,870
Because if he keeps wearing the sweater and static builds up,

324
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,079
you didn't want him to go out

325
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:25,870
and buy static proofclothes.

326
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,770
Of course you didn't want Mr. Sudo to discuss with anybody

327
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,070
about how to become static proof.

328
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,770
Yes, like for example,

329
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:37,095
before getting off the car and touching the ground with your feet,

330
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:38,670
place your hand on the roof of the car.

331
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,270
If you're getting on the car,

332
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,470
before touching the door, touch the ground.

333
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,370
If you're going to touch the door knob, touch the wall first

334
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:48,570
to release the static build up in your body.

335
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,770
There seems to be people who are so afraid of static

336
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,470
that they try to touch the object with just one finger,

337
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,670
but in order to disperse the amount of overcharged static,

338
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,117
it's better to touch the object with the palm of your hand

339
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,170
to avoid the prick.

340
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,370
If Mr. Sudo didn't like wool sweaters,

341
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,870
didn't usually wear them,

342
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,870
and wasn't exposed to too much static,

343
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,870
you could coordinate a combination of wool and fleece

344
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,770
that help in building up static.

345
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,135
Then if you make him insert the key into the keyhole,

346
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:20,070
there is a high possibility that static would occur.

347
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:24,170
Besides, he would be off his guard that static won't happen to him.

348
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,770
But why on earth did you choose to kill him this way?

349
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,470
Because you not only want to get rid of Mr. Sudo,

350
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,870
but wanted to get rid of the car too.

351
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,155
Yes, that's right.

352
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,670
I wanted to get rid of him as well as that car

353
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,670
and erase them from this world.

354
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,161
I wanted to get rid of

355
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:47,870
that ruthless devil disguised under the face of a human!

356
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,670
My father had a bad heart.

357
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,970
He got an attack when he was out driving

358
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,070
with my mother who couldn't drive.

359
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,770
Since they were in a mountain road

360
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,570
where there were not too many people around,

361
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,970
they couldn't get to a hospital and father died.

362
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,670
But he was just unlucky.

363
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:10,370
Yes, it's true that he was unlucky

364
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:14,070
because right after my father had the attack and stopped his car,

365
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:18,670
the car that happened to pass by was the car of that guy.

366
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:21,570
My mother begged him to take them to the hospital,

367
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,170
but he told her...

368
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:27,970
Stay here till you die, old lady!

369
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:32,370
From the shock of that incident,

370
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,213
my mother fell ill and passed away

371
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:39,217
as if going after father.

372
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:43,221
Before she died, mother told me that the car that the guy drove

373
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:49,670
had a silver statue with its wings spread out.

374
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:54,452
So, I checked everywhere I could for the owner of a classic car

375
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:58,250
with a silver statue with its wings spread out.

376
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,550
But Sonny, you sure go all out.

377
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:06,050
If that girl inserted the key into the keyhole before I stopped her,

378
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,250
I hate to think what would've happened.

379
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,550
No problem.

380
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,550
There is no keyhole on the trunk of a Beetle.

381
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,750
And with the mail I sent a while ago,

382
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,850
I asked a certain person

383
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:19,257
to change the contents in the tank to water too.

384
00:22:47,345 --> 00:22:49,350
This racing game sure is fun!

385
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,850
Doc sure does a good job at times!

386
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,750
Huh? Where's Ai?

387
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,350
I'm sure she's up already.

388
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:01,359
Don't tell me that she's still in a bad mood?

389
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,750
Come off it.

390
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:07,650
Ai was suffering with static pricking at her from morning.

391
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,850
And on top of that, she seems to have lost

392
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,450
her static proof goods too.

393
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:16,150
Opening the palm of your hand completely would help.

394
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,450
Ai, why don't you join us playing the game too?

395
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,950
It's fun!

396
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:36,150
Okay.

397
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,750
But I'm a strong player, you know.

398
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,250
Ai, can you do that?

399
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,050
You're the tops, the lone victor!

400
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,050
Wow! Wow!

401
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,050
It sure feels weird when she's in a good mood though.

402
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,411
Next Conan's Hint:

403
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,112
"The ribbon of a parcel".

404
00:23:56,112 --> 00:23:58,354
The coffee shop Poirot is below the agency.

405
00:23:58,354 --> 00:23:59,870
I am Poirot.

406
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:00,980
No, you're not.
