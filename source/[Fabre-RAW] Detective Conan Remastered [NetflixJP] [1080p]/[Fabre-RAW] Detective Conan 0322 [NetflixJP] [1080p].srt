1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,440
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,640
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,040
The truck and ransom that disappeared.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,240
The mysterious veil is peeled off by deduction.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,040
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,260
We, the Youth Detective Squad

9
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:04,060
went to visit our classmate Jun Kataoka in the hospital.

10
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:10,160
But, I was mistaken as being Jun and kidnapped!

11
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,060
The police pursues the Honeybee courier truck

12
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,760
that appears to get the ransom!

13
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,460
However, that car suddenly disappeared

14
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,960
inside the tunnel of the expressway!

15
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,660
"The Kidnap Car That Disappeared (Part 2)"

16
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,360
"Supermarket Moriwaki"

17
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,460
Well, I couldn't help it

18
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,360
because the battery went dead and I didn't know.

19
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
Everybody's probably worried.

20
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,460
Too bad. We almost made it.

21
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,760
Strange. Conan's not answering.

22
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,560
I wonder if something's happened.

23
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,360
What? What do you mean something?

24
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,460
Having a child's body is not bad at a time like this.

25
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,160
Inspector!

26
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,060
We did exactly as the kidnapper told us to, didn't we?

27
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,060
"Shigeru Kataoka (40), young entrepreneur" -Jun...

28
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,260
Jun's going to be returned to us, isn't he?

29
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,760
We're doing the best we can.

30
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,460
"Sachiko Ezaki (30), fashion designer" -Sachiko?

31
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,260
What about the rehearsal?

32
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,360
What's up with your rehearsal?

33
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,460
I explained to the staff that I will be canceling the show.

34
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,960
No way! Your future depends on it!

35
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,160
Never mind us and go back there!

36
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,760
I'm so worried that I can't just do nothing!

37
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,260
I couldn't possibly do my thing even if I went back there.

38
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,760
And... how's Jun?

39
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,860
Nothing... yet.

40
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,660
I'm sorry.

41
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,160
We the police are doing all we can

42
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,860
to locate the Honeybee courier truck,

43
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,760
the whereabouts of the truck that fled.

44
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,360
Inspector Megure!

45
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,360
Did you get any new report?

46
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,060
We contacted the Honeybee courier company

47
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,960
and found that all the vehicles are doing their usual rounds,

48
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,960
and all of them are accounted for.

49
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,460
Could the Honeybee courier truck have been stolen?

50
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,160
No.

51
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,460
Are you saying that you have no clue as to the kidnapper?

52
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,460
Well, Inspector?

53
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,760
Oh, excuse me for a moment.

54
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,860
This is Megure.

55
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,760
Oh! Officer Takagi!

56
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,260
What?

57
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,160
Jun came back to the hospital!

58
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,660
Jun!

59
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,460
I'm so glad! Jun, you're okay.

60
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,260
We were really worried about you.

61
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,460
How's your leg?

62
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,660
"Jun Kataoka (7), Kataoka's son" -Nothing's wrong with my leg!

63
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,860
"Jun Kataoka (7), Kataoka's son" -Oh, that's good.

64
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,160
Officer Takagi! Just what is the meaning of this?

65
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,460
Well, the thing is

66
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,960
they came back to the hospital on their own.

67
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,460
What?

68
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,160
Were you with Jun all this time?

69
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,160
Yeah, but...

70
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,960
-Isn't it? -Yes...

71
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,160
Where were you all this time?

72
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,160
Where...

73
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,360
Jun, you tell them...

74
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,460
I asked them the same question too

75
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,360
but they won't tell me.

76
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,660
It seems that Jun wasn't kidnapped.

77
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,660
Kidnapped?

78
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,960
Since he disappeared from the hospital,

79
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,960
we were all worried that he was kidnapped.

80
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,760
What?

81
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,160
Well, the bed was empty.

82
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,160
And soon after that we got a call demanding ransom.

83
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,960
The bed was empty?

84
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,260
Don't tell me that...

85
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,660
-Yeah. -Huh?

86
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,860
What's the matter?

87
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,160
Big trouble!

88
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,660
Conan is the one who was kidnapped!

89
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,560
What?

90
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,860
Since Jun said he wanted to go play games,

91
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,660
Conan stayed back at the hospital in his place!

92
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,860
I called him on the Youth Detective badge several times

93
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,460
but he hasn't answered!

94
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,960
Maybe...

95
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,060
Maybe... what?

96
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,460
Conan!

97
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,160
Okay, all done.

98
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,360
Thank you!

99
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,260
You're welcome.

100
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,960
Okay.

101
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,660
Will you explain, Conan?

102
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:22,560
Yep. The kidnapper mistook me for Jun and kidnapped me.

103
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,360
Just as I thought.

104
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,560
And? Where were you after you were kidnapped?

105
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,060
There's this closed down factory in Okuho-cho,

106
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,760
and was in the basement.

107
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,860
Did you see the kidnapper's face?

108
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,960
Yep.

109
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,460
He had a mole on the side of his nose.

110
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,660
Officer Takagi. Call Tomokawa right away

111
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,460
and have him draw a composite sketch on the double!

112
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,260
Yes, sir!

113
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,460
I'm so glad everyone's okay.

114
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,860
Although the money was taken,

115
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,360
it's no big deal if the children are all right.

116
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,660
Jun, apologize to everyone.

117
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,660
Why?

118
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,460
What do you mean?

119
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,860
Because everyone worried about you.

120
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,360
You all worried of your own initiative!

121
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,160
What should I care?

122
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,060
Jun!

123
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,460
Jun. Wait!

124
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,960
What do you think you're doing? Let me go!

125
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,160
Ouch!

126
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,160
Darn! Let me go!

127
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,960
That's enough!

128
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,060
What a thing to say after you've done something selfish like this?

129
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,660
Ouch...

130
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,560
I'm sorry, Jun.

131
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,460
It hurt, didn't it? I'm sorry.

132
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,760
But, Conan got hurt because of you.

133
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,360
Still, that doesn't mean that it's okay for me to hit you, does it?

134
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,760
Inspector, I'm sorry.

135
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,960
I'm hungry.

136
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,460
-Conan. -I guess we'll get going then.

137
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,660
-See you. -Yeah.

138
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,260
I've got to stay back and help with the composite sketch.

139
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,060
Why?

140
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,060
The Honeybee courier truck that went into the tunnel.

141
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,660
Why didn't it come out of the exit?

142
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,560
It's the same compact truck after all!

143
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,360
I see, I get it.

144
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,960
Officer Takagi!

145
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,160
What's the matter?

146
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,560
I've figure out the mystery of the Honeybee courier truck

147
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,060
disappearing in the tunnel.

148
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,160
Huh? Really? Tell me about it, Officer Takagi!

149
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,260
Why did the kidnapper use such a flashy car

150
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,360
such as the Honeybee courier truck?

151
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,260
He probably did so to get our attention.

152
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,560
Yep, and then?

153
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,060
So, we the police were only concentrating on

154
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,460
looking out for this flashy Honeybee Courier.

155
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,860
However, the kidnapper paints the truck inside the tunnel

156
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,460
and changed the design of the truck.

157
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,960
That's this compact truck!

158
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,660
It didn't disappear, but rather, deceived us.

159
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,760
How long did that compact truck stay inside the tunnel?

160
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,860
About 10 minutes.

161
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,260
Then, wouldn't it be impossible?

162
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,660
It's not possible to paint an entire car in just 10 minutes.

163
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,360
Oh.

164
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,660
I thought it was a pretty good deduction, though.

165
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,260
Officer Takagi!

166
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,060
The body of a man who was strangled to death

167
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,860
was found by the riverbed of Teimusu River.

168
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,560
What?

169
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,860
The victim is around his 40's

170
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,460
and has a mole on the side of his nose.

171
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,760
According to Conan, the kidnapper also had...

172
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,660
Yep, a mole on the side of his nose!

173
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,660
Then, it could be the same person!

174
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,960
It's possible. Let's go!

175
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,360
Yes, sir!

176
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,960
Inspector Megure.

177
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,460
Wouldn't it be better if I go along too?

178
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,160
Because I saw the kidnapper's face.

179
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,360
Oh, but...

180
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,060
There's nothing to worry about my wound,

181
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,760
I'm just fine.

182
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,860
From the driver's license that the victim had on him,

183
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,360
he is Tadashi Yoshizawa, age 42.

184
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,860
He has strangulation marks on his neck,

185
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,760
so he probably died of suffocation.

186
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,260
I see.

187
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,060
And, this is what we found on the floor of the passenger's seat.

188
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,260
Huh? Earrings.

189
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,160
This car has been reported stolen 2 days ago.

190
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,360
I see.

191
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,560
Inspector Megure.

192
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,160
The person who kidnapped me is this man.

193
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,060
Just as I thought.

194
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,260
And, when is the estimated time of death?

195
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,160
We think it is between 13:00 to 14:00.

196
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,360
So, he was strangled to death

197
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,960
right after he made away with the cash.

198
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,560
And? What about the cash and all?

199
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,960
There was nothing of that sort anywhere.

200
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,460
Judging from the fact that the cash is gone,

201
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,460
it's most likely that he had an accomplice.

202
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,360
They probably got into a brawl which ended up in him being killed.

203
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,360
We need to do a thorough check this guy Yoshizawa's associates!

204
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,060
Inspector!

205
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,860
Oh, Officer Sato!

206
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,960
Inspector, I'm sorry I'm late!

207
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,760
Did you find out anything more?

208
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,960
Yes.

209
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,960
While checking the people who are in close proximity to Mr. Kataoka,

210
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,860
I came across something that may be of concern.

211
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,760
Something of concern?

212
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,860
Right.

213
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,060
Well...

214
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,760
Although it doesn't have the honeybee mark on it,

215
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,960
this is the truck that was used to kidnap me.

216
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,560
Officer Takagi's deduction

217
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,960
was partially correct after all!

218
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,760
But, how in a matter of 10 minutes inside the tunnel...

219
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,440
Yes, this is my earring.

220
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,740
I dropped it somewhere and I was looking for it.

221
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,540
Where did you find this?

222
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,640
Before I answer your question, I'd like to ask you something.

223
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,840
Do you know a person by the name of Yoshizawa?

224
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,140
Yoshizawa?

225
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,440
He's man with a mole on the side of his nose,

226
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,940
who is around 40 years old.

227
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,340
No, I don't.

228
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,340
What about him?

229
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,640
He found dead in a compact truck

230
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,540
that was found abandoned by the riverbed of the Teimusu River.

231
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,940
Oh, my!

232
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,440
That earring was found near the corpse.

233
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,740
Huh?

234
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,640
According to Conan,

235
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,440
it seems that there's no mistake that

236
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,940
Yoshizawa is responsible for the kidnapping.

237
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,540
Judging from the fact that

238
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,440
the ransom was not found anywhere near him,

239
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,240
it is most likely that he had an accomplice,

240
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,340
who he had a fight with, and as result was killed.

241
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,640
I see.

242
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,940
And, who is this accomplice?

243
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,440
After checking Yoshizawa's residence,

244
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,940
they seem to have found the date of

245
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,240
Jun's discharge from the hospital tomorrow

246
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,640
marked on the calendar.

247
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,340
In other words, Yoshizawa and the accomplice carried out the crime

248
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,440
knowing that he would still be in the hospital.

249
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,840
And Yoshizawa did not call Mr. Kataoka's residence but rather,

250
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,040
called him directly on his cell phone.

251
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,040
And finally,

252
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,040
the tracking device that we put inside the bag with the ransom.

253
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,740
The people who knew about this besides us were very limited.

254
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,640
What are you trying to get at?

255
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,340
So, Yoshizawa's accomplice

256
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,640
has to be somebody who is very close to you!

257
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,240
By the way, Ms. Ezaki,

258
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,540
we hear that you have debts?

259
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,940
Huh?

260
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,640
For the last two shows you had, you needed 20,000,000 yen,

261
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,040
and for preparation fees for this show, you needed 10,000,000 yen.

262
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,940
That makes a total of 30,000,000 yen,

263
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,840
the same amount as the ransom demanded this time.

264
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,440
That's...

265
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,540
How do you intend to pay back your debts?

266
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,040
So if this show that is to be held succeeds...

267
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,740
If it doesn't succeed,

268
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,440
all you'll be left with are the debts.

269
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,940
Please wait!

270
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,840
Are you saying that she kidnapped Jun because of her debts?

271
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,640
I can't really say yet.

272
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,140
But it's true that the circumstances look pretty bad for Ms. Ezaki.

273
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,040
I haven't done anything!

274
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,440
I don't know a person by the name of Yoshizawa either.

275
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,540
Anyway, we'll get the details from you at the station.

276
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,140
Will you please come with us?

277
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,140
All right.

278
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,340
Just as I thought.

279
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,740
She was after the money after all.

280
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,840
Jun.

281
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,640
Huh? Ms. Ezaki?

282
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,340
Yeah, she came.

283
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,440
About what time? Do you remember?

284
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,140
I think it was before 13:00.

285
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:57,840
She came to say that the show today may be cancelled.

286
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,340
13.00.

287
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,740
Yoshizawa's estimated time of death is between 13:00 and 14:00.

288
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,640
So alibi barely makes it...

289
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,740
I really don't want her to cancel it

290
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,240
because her designs are fantastic this time.

291
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,040
I'm sure it'll be a success!

292
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,240
Separating trash and throwing them away appropriately

293
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,640
is manners, right?

294
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,440
Maybe...

295
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,540
You're right.

296
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:32,440
It's special so there aren't many companies that make it.

297
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,240
Do you know the name of the company?

298
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,140
Yeah, of course.

299
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,540
That's right.

300
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,540
Until I get my part from you guys,

301
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,340
I can't die even if I wanted to.

302
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:47,540
Bring the cash and come to the place where the kid was confined!

303
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,740
I'll be waiting.

304
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,740
Wait, Officer Sato, I don't think that's a good idea!

305
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,440
We can't afford to be going out at a busy time like this

306
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,340
just because Conan is telling us to come.

307
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,740
Don't worry, I'll take full responsibility!

308
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,140
Even so...

309
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,240
Besides, no matter how I think it out,

310
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,840
I can't believe that Ms. Ezaki is a culprit.

311
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,940
I feel the same too.

312
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,340
Well, Conan sure notices a lot of things other people don't,

313
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,840
so he could help us find a lead to something, right?

314
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,240
Oh.

315
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,240
You said you remembered something, what is it, Conan?

316
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,640
This is the factory where you were confined, right, Conan?

317
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,740
There he is!

318
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,040
Huh? What?

319
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,940
Hide!

320
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,840
Huh? That car.

321
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,740
Mr. Kitayama.

322
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,340
"Goro Kitayama (48), Kataoka's driver" -Yoshizawa?

323
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,640
Hey, Yoshizawa?

324
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,040
Hey, Yoshizawa, it's me!

325
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,140
Mr. Kitayama.

326
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,840
What an unusual place to run into you.

327
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,040
What brings you here?

328
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,840
What?

329
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,140
Nothing really...

330
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,040
You seem to know Tadashi Yoshizawa.

331
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,640
You came because Mr. Yoshizawa told you to come, right?

332
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,340
You were told to bring his share of the money

333
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,540
to the place the kid was confined, right?

334
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,840
But, Conan...

335
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,940
This place is known only to me and the kidnapper.

336
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,440
But he knows this place too, which means...

337
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,340
aren't you an accomplice of the kidnapper, mister?

338
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,740
What a thing to say?

339
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,040
I see.

340
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,340
You would know Mr. Kataoka's cell phone number

341
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,640
and about the tracking device too.

342
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,240
Hey, wait a minute!

343
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,540
You used to work for a printing company before, didn't you?

344
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,040
Conan, what are you trying to get at?

345
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,540
The advertisements that we see on the body of vehicles these days,

346
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,740
those are all printed adhesive seals, right?

347
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,840
Are you talking about the wrapping bus?

348
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,240
Wrapping bus?

349
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,540
I see! I got it!

350
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,740
Huh? What?

351
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,640
I've figured out the mystery of

352
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,240
how the compact Honeybee courier truck disappeared in the tunnel!

353
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,640
Yoshizawa wrapped the truck that he stole,

354
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,240
then he went to get the ransom.

355
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,540
While he fled on the truck, he peeled off the wrapping in the tunnel,

356
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,840
pretended to be a different truck and got away.

357
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:37,340
Mr. Kitayama, aren't you the one who printed that seal?

358
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,240
Well?

359
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,740
This is ridiculous!

360
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,840
Everything you're saying is based on assumption!

361
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,540
Huh?

362
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,040
What's this...

363
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,540
Bag...

364
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,740
Look, Officer Takagi.

365
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,540
There's so much money inside!

366
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,240
Mr. Kitayama, we'd like to talk to you,

367
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,440
so could you come with us to the station?

368
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,440
Darn!

369
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,740
Officer Sato!

370
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,040
No way!

371
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,040
Officer Takagi!

372
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,440
Move!

373
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,640
Hold it!

374
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,540
You're not getting away!

375
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,940
Goro Kitayama, you're under arrest

376
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,140
for obstructing official duty and inflicting injury!

377
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,840
Ouch...

378
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,840
You killed Tadashi Yoshizawa

379
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,340
and put Ms. Ezaki's earring near his corpse

380
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,840
to confuse investigation, didn't you?

381
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,240
Isn't Yoshizawa alive?

382
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,640
What are you talking about?

383
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,740
He was found dead!

384
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,140
Who called me on the phone then?

385
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,640
What the heck are you talking about?

386
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,640
Wow. How fantastic.

387
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,740
Ayumi, is this all there is to a fashion show?

388
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,540
They serving us food and stuff part way, aren't they?

389
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:46,440
Gee, I tell you, Genta, of course not!

390
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,140
Didn't I tell you that it'd be boring for kids?

391
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,540
Let me introduce you!

392
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,640
The designer of this collection,

393
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,240
Sachiko Ezaki!

394
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,540
Jun.

395
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,740
Thank you, Jun.

396
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:25,440
The tuxedo looks really nice on you.

397
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,140
Dad told me to give you this bouquet.

398
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,440
I see...

399
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,140
Congratulations...

400
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,440
Mom.

401
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,880
Let's say it spiritedly. Next Conan's Hint:

402
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,740
"Number 9"

403
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,820
In the next episode, that guy from Osaka will make his appearance.

404
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,320
Detective from the west, Heiji Hattori.

405
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,020
-Who are you again? -I'm sorry.
