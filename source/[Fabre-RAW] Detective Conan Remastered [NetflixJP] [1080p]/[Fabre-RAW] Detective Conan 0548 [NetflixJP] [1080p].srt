1
00:00:02,348 --> 00:00:03,983
The president of a game company,

2
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:07,748
Mr. Kazuyoshi Onda was shot to death.

3
00:00:07,748 --> 00:00:09,448
"Ryosuke Oomine (24)" -And a man called Ryosuke Oomine

4
00:00:09,448 --> 00:00:11,748
emerged as the prime suspect.

5
00:00:11,748 --> 00:00:14,748
Oomine takes a girl hostage at the shopping mall

6
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,748
in order to flee.

7
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:19,999
I, who just happened to be there

8
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:23,048
successfully rescued the girl

9
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:26,448
but ended up as the culprit's hostage in her place.

10
00:00:26,448 --> 00:00:28,848
Oomine brushes the police away

11
00:00:28,848 --> 00:00:31,748
and hides in the basement of a certain building.

12
00:00:32,748 --> 00:00:36,448
I confirmed that Oomine didn't have a gun on him...

13
00:00:37,448 --> 00:00:39,548
and attempt to escape.

14
00:00:39,548 --> 00:00:44,748
We were suddenly fired at by someone with a gun in the dark.

15
00:00:44,748 --> 00:00:47,248
Oomine, protected me from the gun fire,

16
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:49,348
despite risking getting hurt himself.

17
00:00:49,348 --> 00:00:52,548
Is he really a murderer?

18
00:00:52,548 --> 00:00:56,035
There could be something more

19
00:00:56,248 --> 00:00:59,348
behind the President Onda murder case.

20
00:00:59,348 --> 00:01:02,648
When Detective Takagi almost spotted us,

21
00:01:02,648 --> 00:01:05,448
Professor Agasa sped by as per our request.

22
00:01:05,448 --> 00:01:08,448
Because of him, we were saved.

23
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:12,648
Yes, I can't afford to let them arrest him now.

24
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:17,748
Not until I get to reveal the truth

25
00:01:17,748 --> 00:01:19,748
that is hidden.

26
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:26,065
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

27
00:01:26,248 --> 00:01:28,548
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

28
00:01:28,548 --> 00:01:30,348
A queer kidnap case,

29
00:01:30,348 --> 00:01:32,948
I, the hostage discloses who the real culprit is.

30
00:01:32,948 --> 00:01:34,548
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:34,548 --> 00:01:36,075
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:36,248 --> 00:01:38,077
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

33
00:03:19,183 --> 00:03:24,983
"Two Days with the Culprit (2nd Day)"

34
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,683
Conan!

35
00:03:28,683 --> 00:03:30,189
Are you all right?

36
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:32,183
I'm worry.

37
00:03:32,183 --> 00:03:33,683
Ran!

38
00:03:33,683 --> 00:03:37,883
I'm glad. That you've come back safely, Conan.

39
00:03:40,383 --> 00:03:42,201
You!

40
00:03:43,783 --> 00:03:45,983
Ran, wait!

41
00:03:49,383 --> 00:03:53,483
He may not be the culprit.

42
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,583
"Received Call: Oomine"

43
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:06,225
Go ahead and answer it.

44
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:08,983
Isn't that what you're here for?

45
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:11,983
It's me.

46
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:13,583
Oomine?

47
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,183
Who are you?

48
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:17,683
I'm Kogoro Mouri.

49
00:04:17,683 --> 00:04:20,239
Kogoro Mouri?

50
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,883
-Put Kanayama on the phone! -Hey, don't move!

51
00:04:22,883 --> 00:04:24,243
Yes, ma'am.

52
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:29,483
Let me hear Conan's voice, first.

53
00:04:29,483 --> 00:04:31,783
Don't be ridiculous, you!

54
00:04:31,783 --> 00:04:35,683
Conan is fine! You don't have to worry!

55
00:04:35,683 --> 00:04:38,883
Ran, don't tell me you've been taken hostage, too!

56
00:04:38,883 --> 00:04:40,583
No.

57
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,683
Hurry up and put Kanayama on!

58
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,263
What going on?

59
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:46,983
Here, he says to put you on.

60
00:04:46,983 --> 00:04:48,283
Okay.

61
00:04:48,283 --> 00:04:49,283
"Kanayama Seiichi (24)" -Oomine.

62
00:04:49,283 --> 00:04:52,583
"Game Creator" -You idiot! We're in big trouble,

63
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,983
so answer the phone, will you?

64
00:04:53,983 --> 00:04:55,483
Sorry, sorry.

65
00:04:55,483 --> 00:04:58,277
I'll give you the address, so bring a car over!

66
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:00,583
Ask Momoko to do it.

67
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,281
Get the address.

68
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:06,883
The cops came because I was waiting for Momoko at the market.

69
00:05:06,883 --> 00:05:07,983
Momoko?

70
00:05:07,983 --> 00:05:10,289
Just bring a car, will you.

71
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:12,291
I'm getting out of Tokyo.

72
00:05:13,383 --> 00:05:14,683
The address is...

73
00:05:14,683 --> 00:05:18,297
Just tell him that it's Dr. Agasa's house.

74
00:05:18,483 --> 00:05:21,283
Dr. Agasa's house?

75
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:24,303
Don't tell me that Dr. Agasa's being held hostage too?

76
00:05:24,483 --> 00:05:26,883
Okay, here goes.

77
00:05:26,883 --> 00:05:29,583
Momoko is the woman

78
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,983
that was talking on that a while ago?

79
00:05:32,983 --> 00:05:35,483
She's Onda's secretary.

80
00:05:35,483 --> 00:05:39,683
We used to drink a lot together, with Oomine, too.

81
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:44,683
Please go, Mr. Mouri.

82
00:05:44,683 --> 00:05:46,883
I don't have to go, do I?

83
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,383
Did you have that pistol from before?

84
00:05:53,383 --> 00:05:56,883
I bought it on the internet.

85
00:05:56,883 --> 00:06:00,339
I was told it was loaded with blank and yet...

86
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:01,483
Blank?

87
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:05,783
A gun mania remodeled an old metal gun

88
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:07,283
and was selling it.

89
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:10,349
But it's not the kind you can really fire.

90
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:12,351
"Homemade Gun Sale" -The bullets are blank that look

91
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:13,983
just like real bullets.

92
00:06:13,983 --> 00:06:16,355
So, I ordered 1 revolver

93
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:18,683
and three blank bullets.

94
00:06:18,683 --> 00:06:22,383
I just took it with me to threaten Onda.

95
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:24,983
"Caution" -It even said that the bullets are blank...

96
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:27,683
"Do not fire at people." -on the instruction sheet.

97
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:37,583
But, it turned out to be real when you fired it?

98
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:38,377
Yes.

99
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,983
And what did you do with that pistol?

100
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,983
I threw it away.

101
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,983
I thought that I was in bad trouble.

102
00:07:01,983 --> 00:07:04,183
I haven't heard any news

103
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:07,083
reporting that the gun was found though.

104
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,683
Why don't we go there?

105
00:07:08,683 --> 00:07:10,683
Don't be ridiculous!

106
00:07:10,683 --> 00:07:13,583
I'm getting out of here when the car comes!

107
00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:18,417
Kanayama!

108
00:07:26,883 --> 00:07:28,683
Dad!

109
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:34,783
Renowned Detective Kogoro Mouri

110
00:07:34,783 --> 00:07:38,783
has captured the murderer Ryosuke Oomine!

111
00:07:38,783 --> 00:07:42,441
I sure hope it turns out that way.

112
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:46,883
Mr. Oomine may have been taken advantage of by someone.

113
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,583
Just what are you talking about, brat?

114
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,383
It seems that the bullet that was fired from Mr. Oomine's gun

115
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:54,183
was a blank.

116
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:57,783
We need to find the gun that he fired, right?

117
00:07:57,783 --> 00:08:02,183
Come to think of it, the gun hasn't been found yet.

118
00:08:02,183 --> 00:08:05,083
Okay, let's look for it!

119
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,883
First let's try going to the building where you threw the gun away.

120
00:08:10,983 --> 00:08:14,473
You heard the gun hit something after you threw it, right?

121
00:08:14,683 --> 00:08:16,183
Right.

122
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:18,477
If so, it's most likely that

123
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:20,479
it hit the wall of the building.

124
00:08:25,283 --> 00:08:27,283
There it is.

125
00:08:27,283 --> 00:08:29,083
This way!

126
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,493
The scratch is still new.

127
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:38,497
There's probably no doubt that the gun hit here.

128
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:41,683
If it hit here, it wouldn't bounce too far, right?

129
00:08:41,683 --> 00:08:43,483
Right.

130
00:08:43,483 --> 00:08:45,983
Some parts are damp.

131
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,507
Someone must've walked around.

132
00:08:51,883 --> 00:08:53,083
Could it be that...

133
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,515
If someone tried to frame Mr. Oomine,

134
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:59,583
maybe the real culprit came to retrieve it?

135
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,083
When you threw the gun away,

136
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,523
weren't they doing something at the building?

137
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:08,083
To think that I would be able to meet

138
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,283
the renowned detective Kogoro Mouri.

139
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:10,883
It's such an honor!

140
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,583
I'm sure glad that I work as a security guard!

141
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,535
Oh, is that right? Lucky you, lucky you.

142
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:19,583
I actually want to become a detective myself.

143
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,583
I'll quit this job right away,

144
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:25,083
so would you please use me as your assistant, sir?

145
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:28,547
This is a device for wiping windows, isn't it?

146
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:31,883
Yeah, don't dare touch it, brat.

147
00:09:31,883 --> 00:09:34,083
What's with that remark of yours, mister?

148
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,555
Oh, I'm sorry!

149
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:40,559
Does this go up and down along the rail of the building?

150
00:09:40,783 --> 00:09:43,683
Exactly, little mister.

151
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,283
Is it fully automatic?

152
00:09:45,283 --> 00:09:47,383
Exactly.

153
00:09:47,383 --> 00:09:51,083
Did you wipe the windows last night?

154
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,571
Yes, I did.

155
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:55,383
The windows over there by the corridor.

156
00:09:55,383 --> 00:09:58,083
I do it at night

157
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:01,083
because if I do it in the day time, the soap drips

158
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,083
and causes inconvenience to the tenants.

159
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,083
The reason for the wet ground

160
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,183
is the soap from the window wiping device.

161
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:17,183
There it is.

162
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,383
Detective Mouri, please.

163
00:10:19,383 --> 00:10:20,599
Here it is!

164
00:10:21,883 --> 00:10:25,683
When Mr. Oomine threw the gun,

165
00:10:25,683 --> 00:10:28,607
the automatic window wiping device was operating.

166
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:34,613
The gun that Mr. Oomine threw

167
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:38,617
fell right on the window wiping device that came right below it.

168
00:10:39,683 --> 00:10:42,621
Then, together with the window wiping device

169
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:45,283
that came back to the roof

170
00:10:45,283 --> 00:10:48,883
after it finished its session and fell here.

171
00:10:55,183 --> 00:10:58,283
This is very well made

172
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,639
but it's a fake.

173
00:11:00,883 --> 00:11:03,683
Because there's gunpowder in the cartridge.

174
00:11:03,683 --> 00:11:07,383
Which means that if you fire it, a gunshot will sound,

175
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:09,583
but the bullet will shatter from the impact.

176
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:12,651
Then, why did President Onda die?

177
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:15,183
Isn't it because someone shot him?

178
00:11:15,183 --> 00:11:18,083
-What? -The real killer who was hiding somewhere

179
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,883
in the park...

180
00:11:25,683 --> 00:11:29,383
fired his gun the instant...

181
00:11:31,783 --> 00:11:34,183
Mr. Oomine fired the blank

182
00:11:34,183 --> 00:11:37,183
and killed President Onda.

183
00:11:37,183 --> 00:11:39,083
I see.

184
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:42,681
Then, there are three suspects for now.

185
00:11:42,883 --> 00:11:45,783
Game creator, Seiichi Kanayama.

186
00:11:46,883 --> 00:11:50,183
The president's secretary, Momoko Uemiya

187
00:11:50,183 --> 00:11:53,883
and vice president, Satoshi Kanda.

188
00:11:53,883 --> 00:11:57,783
Kanayama was on bad terms with Onda because of money matters.

189
00:11:57,783 --> 00:12:01,483
Uemiya probably had relationship problems with him.

190
00:12:01,483 --> 00:12:05,083
And Kanda is said to have been going through power harassment.

191
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,683
But, didn't President Onda have many problems

192
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:10,483
regarding his work?

193
00:12:10,483 --> 00:12:12,383
Oh, right.

194
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:15,883
I mean, stop being cheeky, you brat!

195
00:12:18,283 --> 00:12:20,283
How did you find the website of the guy

196
00:12:20,283 --> 00:12:22,483
that sold you the gun on the internet?

197
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:24,283
Well. You see...

198
00:12:24,283 --> 00:12:26,725
What're you hiding? Be honest and spit it out!

199
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:28,983
It's Momoko.

200
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:30,729
What?

201
00:12:33,483 --> 00:12:37,283
Momoko said that I should possess a gun or something

202
00:12:37,283 --> 00:12:40,739
because Onda was a candidate for the Olympic games in Judo.

203
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:43,483
Therefore, she told me about the gun mania website.

204
00:12:43,483 --> 00:12:46,083
I see.

205
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:50,283
Keep out of this! Children's time is over.

206
00:12:56,383 --> 00:12:59,083
Doc.

207
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,759
I've got one more place

208
00:13:00,983 --> 00:13:03,483
I want to go to.

209
00:13:05,683 --> 00:13:09,583
Why is it you have so many spare keys?

210
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,183
When I came to Tokyo,

211
00:13:11,183 --> 00:13:13,983
I was working as security guard for this building.

212
00:13:13,983 --> 00:13:16,775
I made the keys back then.

213
00:13:19,483 --> 00:13:21,283
At that time...

214
00:13:31,183 --> 00:13:33,583
What was that sound?

215
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,483
I see.

216
00:13:35,483 --> 00:13:36,795
Hey!

217
00:13:51,783 --> 00:13:53,683
So that's how it was.

218
00:13:53,683 --> 00:13:57,083
Hey, what're you doing, kid?

219
00:13:57,083 --> 00:14:01,683
Who knew that you used to work as a security guard here?

220
00:14:01,683 --> 00:14:06,825
Knayama, Momoko, and vice president, Mr. Kanda.

221
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:09,183
What kind of person is Mr. Kanda?

222
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:12,831
He looks after Kanayama a lot.

223
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:14,833
"Satoshi Kanda (32)" -He used to take me drinking a lot

224
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,835
along with Kanayama.

225
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:19,383
He's kind person.

226
00:14:22,283 --> 00:14:25,483
Have you ever acted on stage?

227
00:14:25,483 --> 00:14:28,383
What kind of question is that, out of the blue?

228
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,967
"OnDack"

229
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:39,167
"President's Office"

230
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:41,367
Hey, we can't have you come in...

231
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:43,367
Mr. Mouri?

232
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:46,367
I'd like to talk to the Inspector.

233
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:48,867
I heard from Mr. Kanayama

234
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:51,367
that you meet Oomine at Dr. Agasa's residence.

235
00:14:51,367 --> 00:14:52,667
Yes, sir.

236
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:56,267
Inspector, Oomine is not the culprit.

237
00:14:56,267 --> 00:14:58,877
The real culprit is someone else.

238
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:00,567
What are you saying?

239
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:04,067
Could you call Ms. Momoko Uemiya?

240
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:07,267
"Momoko Uemiya (24), Onda's Secretary"

241
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:10,667
So the actors have all lined up here.

242
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:13,567
What do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

243
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:15,767
Let me explain in order.

244
00:15:15,767 --> 00:15:18,567
First, this case started with the trouble

245
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:22,167
between President Onda and Mr. Kanayama.

246
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:25,767
The game software that Mr. Kanayama made was a great hit,

247
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:28,267
and yet despite the big profit that was gained,

248
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:30,567
the cause of the trouble was because

249
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:35,267
President Onda didn't pay Mr. Kanayama much.

250
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,167
Mr. Kanayama who was outraged

251
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:42,067
bad mouthed President Onda to Mr. Oomine.

252
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,767
After hearing about this, Oomine offered

253
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:46,467
to threaten President Onda.

254
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:49,867
Then, Momoko Uemiya comes along.

255
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:52,931
Mr. Kanayama and Ms. Uemiya are colleagues at the same company,

256
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:55,967
and they used to go with each other at one time.

257
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:59,967
Oomine was in love with Momoko.

258
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:03,967
Are you're saying that I got him into this?

259
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:05,667
Exactly.

260
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:07,467
Don't be ridiculous!

261
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,949
You told Oomine of the gun mania website

262
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:12,567
that sold guns...

263
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:14,953
I got advertisement mail from that website,

264
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:17,367
that's why I told him about it,

265
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:19,267
that's all there was to it.

266
00:16:19,267 --> 00:16:20,967
Cut it out!

267
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:26,267
Oomine? Conan!

268
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:29,267
Don't move! I'm going to blow this kid up!

269
00:16:29,267 --> 00:16:31,967
Please don't make a fuss because he'll shoot me!

270
00:16:31,967 --> 00:16:35,967
Bastard! I could've showed everybody what I can do, and yet...

271
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:38,367
Gather by the wall! The wall!

272
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:42,067
Let me go!

273
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,667
Don't! It's dangerous!

274
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:05,667
You're being to reckless, Mr. Kanda.

275
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:07,967
I... I guess I got carried away.

276
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:11,367
Thanks to the brat, it's gotten out of hand.

277
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:20,067
Oomine, resign yourself.

278
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:22,167
Wait, please!

279
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:25,667
I haven't finished talking yet.

280
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:27,025
Mr. Mouri?

281
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:30,367
How far did I go?

282
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,767
You were saying that Ms. Uemiya was a suspect.

283
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:34,567
That's not right!

284
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:35,867
What?

285
00:17:35,867 --> 00:17:37,035
But, you just said so...

286
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:39,667
The important point is who will benefit most

287
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:43,041
from President Onda dying.

288
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:46,767
I get no cash even if the president were to die.

289
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:48,467
It's not me, either.

290
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,367
After all, I reported to the police

291
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:53,051
that I got a call from Mr. Oomine!

292
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:57,055
Then, the only one left is you.

293
00:17:57,267 --> 00:17:59,967
What? Why're you looking at me?

294
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:02,467
You're gallant, aren't you?

295
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:04,267
Because you had the guts to pounce on Mr. Oomine

296
00:18:04,267 --> 00:18:05,667
who is wanted for murder

297
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,467
and possesses a gun on top of that.

298
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:12,267
Well, I was desperate to save everyone.

299
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:13,667
Isn't it because you knew

300
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:16,767
that Oomine's gun was filled with blank?

301
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:20,267
That's because you're the one

302
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:23,667
who sold the blank bullets and gun to Mr. Oomine.

303
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,967
The one who killed President Onda

304
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:29,087
is you, Mr. Kanda!

305
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:32,367
No way. What a crazy thing to say!

306
00:18:32,367 --> 00:18:37,095
President Onda power harassed you.

307
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:39,097
Isn't that right, Mr. Kanayama?

308
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:43,101
Mr. Kanda became the target of the president's bullying.

309
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:46,167
After finding out that Mr. Kanayama

310
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,167
had a grudge against the president,

311
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:52,067
you schemed to take advantage of his fact.

312
00:18:52,067 --> 00:18:53,667
If Mr. Onda disappears,

313
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:56,367
you'll become the president.

314
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:58,867
As a gun mania, you remodeled the metal model gun

315
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:01,567
that you had hidden,

316
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:04,167
made a website to sell the gun

317
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:07,125
and sent the mail address to Momoko.

318
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,667
Just as you intended,

319
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:12,167
Momoko sent the address of the website to Mr. Oomine.

320
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:14,767
Mr. Oomine bought the remodeled gun

321
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:16,867
and blank bullets from you.

322
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:19,567
As for the blank, you probably remodeled the bullets

323
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:23,667
that you secretly brought back from abroad.

324
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:27,867
And at the same time that Mr. Oomine shot the blank...

325
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:33,867
you fired a real bullet using the other remodeled gun that you made!

326
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:40,167
After that, you needed to retrieve Mr. Oomine's gun

327
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:43,767
to hide the fact that his gun was loaded with blanks.

328
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:54,867
You desperately went to look for the gun

329
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:57,167
but you couldn't find it.

330
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:01,179
Where do you think it was?

331
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:10,167
It was on the automatic window wiping machine

332
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:14,767
and carried all the way up to the roof.

333
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:16,167
I see.

334
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:18,267
It's a great deduction.

335
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:21,199
However, do you have proof?

336
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:23,567
That I remodeled a gun

337
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:25,203
or even went to search for it.

338
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:28,067
If you went to search for the gun,

339
00:20:28,067 --> 00:20:30,067
the soil around the building

340
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:31,867
and the soap from the window wiping machine

341
00:20:31,867 --> 00:20:34,167
should be on your shoes.

342
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,215
And one more thing,

343
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:40,267
the culprit has a wounded right finger.

344
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:48,467
Mr. Oomine who took Conan hostage

345
00:20:48,467 --> 00:20:51,767
was shot at in the basement of the building.

346
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:53,231
But, remodeled guns

347
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:55,233
are not all that strong to begin with.

348
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:02,267
Here, this.

349
00:21:02,267 --> 00:21:05,567
Oh, thank you.

350
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:07,567
-There's blood on it. -Yes.

351
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:09,267
If you check the blood,

352
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:12,567
you'll find that it's vice president Kanda's.

353
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:28,167
Compensate for what you did and re-do your life once again.

354
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:30,467
Sorry, that things had to turn out this way

355
00:21:30,467 --> 00:21:33,271
just because of me.

356
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:35,267
It's okay.

357
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:38,467
I guess it's a good chance

358
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:41,267
to go straight!

359
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:42,967
That's good.

360
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:44,967
-Really? -Yep.

361
00:21:51,967 --> 00:21:53,067
What's the matter?

362
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:55,567
The case has already been solved.

363
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:57,295
Oh, good work.

364
00:21:57,295 --> 00:22:00,067
Oh, well...

365
00:23:24,367 --> 00:23:26,867
You must've been scared, Conan.

366
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:28,567
No big deal.

367
00:23:28,567 --> 00:23:30,267
Since you went through a frightening experience.

368
00:23:30,267 --> 00:23:33,391
I'll make something delicious for you to eat today.

369
00:23:33,567 --> 00:23:34,567
Thank you.

370
00:23:34,567 --> 00:23:36,967
Found the brat!

371
00:23:36,967 --> 00:23:40,467
Well, you really come in handy.

372
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:43,167
If we go to along with an grade school kid,

373
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:45,967
we get to eat Miracle Mille Crepe at Patisserie Matsui

374
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:48,367
for half price!

375
00:23:48,367 --> 00:23:49,667
I... I've got something to do,

376
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:51,867
so if you will excuse me.

377
00:23:51,867 --> 00:23:53,767
Hold it!

378
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:57,067
I would sure like you to half price your crazy ideas.

379
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:59,167
I can get points for this, too!

380
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

381
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,423
"Clockwise"

382
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,425
What is clockwise?

383
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:09,042
Which way does it turn, right or left?

384
00:24:09,042 --> 00:24:11,000
Either which way.
