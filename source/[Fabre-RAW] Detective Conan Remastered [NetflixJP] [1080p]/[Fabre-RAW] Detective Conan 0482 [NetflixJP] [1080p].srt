1
00:00:02,434 --> 00:00:04,234
The light of summer is the glory of yesterday.

2
00:00:04,234 --> 00:00:06,034
After the tears, a cook is born.

3
00:00:06,034 --> 00:00:07,534
Officer Yamamura of the Gunma Prefectural Police.

4
00:00:07,534 --> 00:00:09,134
Breaks through the deduction spinning round and round.

5
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,034
And solves the mystery of the missing murder weapon.

6
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:12,434
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,434 --> 00:00:14,134
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,134 --> 00:00:16,434
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:57,294 --> 00:02:00,094
We came along with Doc to go camping

10
00:02:00,094 --> 00:02:01,794
during summer vacation.

11
00:02:01,794 --> 00:02:05,194
But, our car got a flat on the way,

12
00:02:05,194 --> 00:02:06,994
so we had no choice

13
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,694
but to ask an old woman who lived alone in a remote mountain area

14
00:02:08,694 --> 00:02:10,494
to let us spend the night at her place.

15
00:02:10,494 --> 00:02:13,194
"Tanaka Iwae, age 74"

16
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:16,194
Likewise, two men and a woman,

17
00:02:16,194 --> 00:02:17,694
"Akane Ouba, age 25" -three people who also get lost,

18
00:02:17,694 --> 00:02:20,494
"Raito Adachi, age 29" -spend the night in the same house together.

19
00:02:20,494 --> 00:02:22,694
"Fuga Kahara, age 28"

20
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,594
That night, Mitsuhiko who goes to the restroom,

21
00:02:26,594 --> 00:02:29,394
witnesses something gruesome,

22
00:02:29,394 --> 00:02:33,394
and right afterwards, the girl named Akane Ouba is found murdered!

23
00:02:35,694 --> 00:02:39,394
This... granny...

24
00:02:39,394 --> 00:02:42,594
was...

25
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:44,694
sharpening a kitchen knife!

26
00:02:44,694 --> 00:02:46,894
Her hair was disheveled!

27
00:02:46,894 --> 00:02:49,494
And, it was a knife with a bright red handle.

28
00:02:49,494 --> 00:02:51,494
She looked like an ogre!

29
00:02:55,294 --> 00:03:01,194
"The Knife of The Mountain Crone Part Two"

30
00:03:02,494 --> 00:03:05,094
Is it true? What you just said.

31
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:07,494
It's true!

32
00:03:07,494 --> 00:03:08,994
Which means...

33
00:03:10,394 --> 00:03:12,494
You're saying that a knife with a bright red handle

34
00:03:12,494 --> 00:03:13,794
is not here?

35
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,794
Huh? Yes.

36
00:03:15,794 --> 00:03:17,794
You heard what he said.

37
00:03:17,794 --> 00:03:20,894
Well, I don't know anything about a knife

38
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:22,694
with a bright red handle.

39
00:03:22,694 --> 00:03:24,294
I'm sure that he was probably freaked out by me

40
00:03:24,294 --> 00:03:26,494
looking like a mountain crone,

41
00:03:26,494 --> 00:03:30,494
that's why he saw such an illusion.

42
00:03:30,494 --> 00:03:32,894
But I'm sure that I saw her.

43
00:03:34,694 --> 00:03:38,994
We're going to start a thorough search of the house right now.

44
00:03:38,994 --> 00:03:42,794
So will you all please wait in the room beyond.

45
00:03:45,694 --> 00:03:47,794
Come on, let's go, Yoshida.

46
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,694
Okay.

47
00:03:51,894 --> 00:03:54,094
Huh? That's strange.

48
00:03:54,094 --> 00:03:55,294
What's strange?

49
00:03:55,294 --> 00:03:57,594
The hammer that I brought to hammer in the pegs of the tent

50
00:03:57,594 --> 00:03:59,594
isn't here.

51
00:03:59,594 --> 00:04:00,994
Hammer?

52
00:04:00,994 --> 00:04:04,094
That bag was left out in the corridor, wasn't it?

53
00:04:04,094 --> 00:04:07,594
Hey, don't tell me that the killer...

54
00:04:07,594 --> 00:04:11,394
Don't be silly, you can't slash a person's neck with a hammer.

55
00:04:11,394 --> 00:04:13,394
That's right.

56
00:04:13,394 --> 00:04:16,194
I'm going to ask the officer.

57
00:04:19,094 --> 00:04:20,294
Oh, I'll go with you.

58
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:25,294
The hammer was found in the forest nearby.

59
00:04:25,294 --> 00:04:26,594
A pretty new one too.

60
00:04:26,594 --> 00:04:28,194
Huh? Really?

61
00:04:28,194 --> 00:04:30,394
Then, you'd better check thoroughly!

62
00:04:30,377 --> 00:04:32,377
The killer may have used it.

63
00:04:32,377 --> 00:04:35,477
But, a hammer is not a knife.

64
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:39,777
What's wrong?

65
00:04:39,777 --> 00:04:42,177
That... did you check that box?

66
00:04:42,177 --> 00:04:43,377
Huh?

67
00:04:43,377 --> 00:04:45,777
Oh no, not the boxes around here yet...

68
00:04:47,277 --> 00:04:48,877
Hey, boy!

69
00:04:55,277 --> 00:04:58,877
Hey, this is a knife!

70
00:04:58,877 --> 00:05:00,577
A knife with a red handle.

71
00:05:00,594 --> 00:05:02,794
This is the knife that Mitsuhiko saw.

72
00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:05,894
It's well maintained and the blade is sharp.

73
00:05:05,894 --> 00:05:09,894
Huh? Below the knife maker's signature named...

74
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:10,994
Shota?

75
00:05:11,994 --> 00:05:14,894
Shota is the name of granny's grandson.

76
00:05:15,894 --> 00:05:17,594
Huh? Nothing was detected?

77
00:05:17,594 --> 00:05:19,694
Luminol reaction wasn't detected?

78
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,494
No. None was detected from the knives in this house

79
00:05:22,494 --> 00:05:24,794
or from your camping equipment.

80
00:05:24,794 --> 00:05:26,794
Of course there were no traces on the knife

81
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,794
with the red handle either.

82
00:05:28,794 --> 00:05:32,694
After you found it and all, too bad.

83
00:05:32,694 --> 00:05:35,894
I see. So, that's the story after all.

84
00:05:35,894 --> 00:05:37,394
By the way,

85
00:05:37,394 --> 00:05:38,594
did you people play with mud or something?

86
00:05:38,594 --> 00:05:41,294
What? Play with mud?

87
00:05:41,294 --> 00:05:42,294
We found traces showing

88
00:05:42,294 --> 00:05:46,994
that several people walked around this house with muddy feet.

89
00:05:46,994 --> 00:05:49,094
Traces of muddy feet?

90
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:51,594
Of the dead body being moved without permission

91
00:05:51,594 --> 00:05:53,894
and walking around with muddy feet.

92
00:05:53,894 --> 00:05:55,594
I mean what a thing to do.

93
00:05:57,294 --> 00:05:58,494
Wait a second, muddy feet...

94
00:05:58,494 --> 00:06:01,194
If I remember correctly, back then...

95
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,694
Huh? Okay.

96
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:06,294
Granny was barefoot.

97
00:06:06,294 --> 00:06:08,394
Even the man called Fuga.

98
00:06:08,394 --> 00:06:11,094
I ran out barefoot too.

99
00:06:11,094 --> 00:06:12,594
The man called Raito...

100
00:06:12,594 --> 00:06:14,194
Raito!

101
00:06:14,194 --> 00:06:15,194
Fuga?

102
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:18,494
He was wearing shoes.

103
00:06:18,494 --> 00:06:19,494
Hey!

104
00:06:19,494 --> 00:06:20,894
Huh?

105
00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:22,894
Just what're you doing?

106
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:26,494
Because the goldfish looked thirsty and I felt sorry for it.

107
00:06:26,494 --> 00:06:28,094
What?

108
00:06:28,094 --> 00:06:30,594
See. Last night the water was up here

109
00:06:30,594 --> 00:06:32,694
to where the water stain is,

110
00:06:32,694 --> 00:06:33,894
but it's decreased quite a bit.

111
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,194
This means that the goldfish was hot

112
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:39,294
and drank a lot of water, right?

113
00:06:39,294 --> 00:06:42,494
I see, that's why the killer used the hammer.

114
00:06:42,494 --> 00:06:44,794
That's why I put tap water inside.

115
00:06:44,794 --> 00:06:45,994
That's not good, Ayumi.

116
00:06:45,994 --> 00:06:47,094
Huh?

117
00:06:47,094 --> 00:06:50,094
You've got to get rid of the chlorine first

118
00:06:50,094 --> 00:06:52,394
or it will weaken the goldfish.

119
00:06:52,394 --> 00:06:56,594
Besides, the goldfish are keeping watch,

120
00:06:56,594 --> 00:06:58,194
so you shouldn't keep them from doing so.

121
00:06:58,194 --> 00:07:00,594
Keeping watch?

122
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:04,094
Yeah, the weapon which has been in use since ancient times,

123
00:07:04,094 --> 00:07:05,694
over its location, that is.

124
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:10,094
I will explain from the conclusion.

125
00:07:10,094 --> 00:07:14,494
There were no traces of luminol reaction detected

126
00:07:14,494 --> 00:07:18,794
from knives and sharp objects in this house nor any of your belongings.

127
00:07:18,794 --> 00:07:21,894
Moreover, after you all ran over to Ms. Ouba who screamed

128
00:07:21,894 --> 00:07:26,094
when she was slashed in the throat,

129
00:07:26,094 --> 00:07:30,094
and considering that none of you left this house,

130
00:07:30,094 --> 00:07:34,094
it would've been impossible to take the murder weapon away.

131
00:07:34,094 --> 00:07:37,694
Therefore, all of you cannot be suspects.

132
00:07:37,694 --> 00:07:41,194
We means that we won't be interrogated either?

133
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,994
No, we'd like to use your testimonies

134
00:07:43,994 --> 00:07:46,194
as reference for further investigation,

135
00:07:46,194 --> 00:07:50,194
so we may ask you to come to the station at a later date.

136
00:07:50,194 --> 00:07:52,794
Well, if it's not as a suspect, I guess it's okay.

137
00:07:52,794 --> 00:07:54,994
Excuse me.

138
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:56,894
What about the knife?

139
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,494
Yeah, as to that,

140
00:07:58,494 --> 00:08:02,594
Conan found it put away in a wooden box.

141
00:08:02,594 --> 00:08:05,894
As to why you didn't talk about that knife,

142
00:08:05,894 --> 00:08:09,094
we'll thoroughly hear you out later at the station.

143
00:08:09,094 --> 00:08:12,194
I had just forgotten about it.

144
00:08:12,194 --> 00:08:14,594
After all, I'm old, you know.

145
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,994
But, how did the killer get away?

146
00:08:17,994 --> 00:08:21,094
There were no strange footprints around the house

147
00:08:21,094 --> 00:08:23,094
except for by the front entrance, right?

148
00:08:23,094 --> 00:08:24,994
Oh, as to that...

149
00:08:24,994 --> 00:08:29,394
I'm sure that the killer used some kind of a trick.

150
00:08:29,394 --> 00:08:33,994
No... it's only natural that there are no footprints.

151
00:08:33,994 --> 00:08:37,494
Because the killer and the murder weapon is still in this house.

152
00:08:37,494 --> 00:08:39,494
What...

153
00:08:39,494 --> 00:08:43,294
Hey, tell me first if you're going to use my voice.

154
00:08:43,294 --> 00:08:44,894
You surprised me out of my wits.

155
00:08:44,894 --> 00:08:46,194
Sorry.

156
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:48,894
No offense.

157
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:52,294
We, the police checked the house thoroughly and found nothing.

158
00:08:52,294 --> 00:08:56,494
Just where in this house do you claim is the murder weapon?

159
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,394
It's not that you didn't find it.

160
00:08:58,394 --> 00:09:00,494
It's just that you haven't checked it yet.

161
00:09:00,494 --> 00:09:04,494
Why? Because that murder weapon is something that was in this house

162
00:09:04,494 --> 00:09:07,694
to begin with that the killer transformed into a knife.

163
00:09:07,694 --> 00:09:10,794
It doesn't look to be a murder weapon at all.

164
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:13,394
Transformed?

165
00:09:13,394 --> 00:09:15,194
Something in this house?

166
00:09:15,194 --> 00:09:16,894
Please wait.

167
00:09:16,894 --> 00:09:19,994
Using something that was in this house to begin with,

168
00:09:19,994 --> 00:09:21,394
would mean that the killer is someone

169
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,794
that knows a lot about this house.

170
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:26,494
Are you saying that the granny who lives here

171
00:09:26,494 --> 00:09:28,394
is the killer after all?

172
00:09:29,594 --> 00:09:30,694
No...

173
00:09:30,694 --> 00:09:31,894
Huh?

174
00:09:31,894 --> 00:09:35,594
There is another person here that has been living in this house

175
00:09:35,594 --> 00:09:37,094
for about 20 years.

176
00:09:37,094 --> 00:09:38,794
Here?

177
00:09:38,794 --> 00:09:40,094
Isn't that right?

178
00:09:40,094 --> 00:09:43,894
Grandson of granny, Mr. Fuga Kahara.

179
00:09:43,894 --> 00:09:44,894
What the...

180
00:09:47,494 --> 00:09:50,194
Hey, Fuga, is that true?

181
00:09:50,194 --> 00:09:51,294
That's ridiculous.

182
00:09:51,294 --> 00:09:52,794
Come to think of it,

183
00:09:52,794 --> 00:09:55,094
when asked about the bathroom of this house,

184
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,694
you answered right away, didn't you?

185
00:09:56,694 --> 00:10:00,394
I remembered because I used it last night...

186
00:10:00,394 --> 00:10:02,494
Then, why did you say those words?

187
00:10:02,494 --> 00:10:04,294
Said what?

188
00:10:04,294 --> 00:10:08,594
Remember, what you said when you first came here?

189
00:10:08,594 --> 00:10:12,394
Boy, do you live here?

190
00:10:12,394 --> 00:10:16,594
That means that you knew I don't live here, right?

191
00:10:16,594 --> 00:10:18,894
Oh, well, that's...

192
00:10:18,894 --> 00:10:19,894
Is that right?

193
00:10:19,894 --> 00:10:24,494
Huh? I was asked by her grandson to do him a favor.

194
00:10:24,494 --> 00:10:25,794
He asked me to check up and see how his grandmother

195
00:10:25,794 --> 00:10:28,594
that he hadn't seen for some time is doing.

196
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:32,294
He told me that his grandmother was living alone.

197
00:10:32,294 --> 00:10:34,694
Then, why did you know about the goldfish?

198
00:10:34,694 --> 00:10:36,294
Goldfish?

199
00:10:36,294 --> 00:10:38,194
I remember you saying,

200
00:10:38,194 --> 00:10:39,594
of all the 12 goldfish here,

201
00:10:39,594 --> 00:10:43,394
the Tamasaba is a rare species.

202
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:45,294
Didn't I also say back then

203
00:10:45,294 --> 00:10:47,994
that I used to keep goldfish as pets before.

204
00:10:47,994 --> 00:10:50,494
It's natural to be able to tell goldfish apart by looking at them.

205
00:10:50,494 --> 00:10:53,994
No, not the species, but the number.

206
00:10:53,994 --> 00:10:55,794
Number?

207
00:10:55,794 --> 00:10:57,694
No matter how knowledgeable you are with goldfish,

208
00:10:57,694 --> 00:10:59,694
to know at a glance

209
00:10:59,694 --> 00:11:02,994
that there are 12 of them swimming around in the tank,

210
00:11:02,994 --> 00:11:05,994
no one would know except for the person who owns the goldfish, right?

211
00:11:07,594 --> 00:11:10,094
I see, that's true.

212
00:11:10,094 --> 00:11:13,194
No, that's not it. I...

213
00:11:15,394 --> 00:11:16,594
I...

214
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:19,494
Then, don't tell me that getting lost here

215
00:11:19,494 --> 00:11:20,794
and running out of gas were...

216
00:11:20,794 --> 00:11:22,194
Yeah, probably.

217
00:11:22,194 --> 00:11:24,794
He did it deliberately

218
00:11:24,794 --> 00:11:27,194
so that he could check on how his grandmother was doing.

219
00:11:27,194 --> 00:11:28,694
He probably thought that she wouldn't recognize his face

220
00:11:28,694 --> 00:11:31,094
after plastic surgery.

221
00:11:31,094 --> 00:11:32,694
I see...

222
00:11:32,694 --> 00:11:35,894
Which means, the reason why you didn't want to go through interrogation

223
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:37,794
as much as you did was...

224
00:11:37,794 --> 00:11:39,694
You are the killer!

225
00:11:39,694 --> 00:11:42,694
No! I didn't do it! It's not me!

226
00:11:42,694 --> 00:11:44,094
No, you said what you said

227
00:11:44,094 --> 00:11:45,894
only because you wanted to hide your real name.

228
00:11:45,894 --> 00:11:46,894
Real name?

229
00:11:46,894 --> 00:11:49,094
When Fuga started to make a fuss,

230
00:11:49,094 --> 00:11:52,394
you were about to say something, weren't you, Raito?

231
00:11:52,394 --> 00:11:56,494
Oh, I figured I should give my real name at that time.

232
00:11:56,494 --> 00:12:00,294
Raito Adachi is the name that I use back at the shop.

233
00:12:00,294 --> 00:12:02,294
A pseudonym?

234
00:12:02,294 --> 00:12:04,094
What's your name then?

235
00:12:04,094 --> 00:12:05,994
Since he was afraid that this would happen,

236
00:12:05,994 --> 00:12:09,994
he began making a fuss over the interrogation.

237
00:12:09,994 --> 00:12:12,594
What Fuga wanted to hide was the fact

238
00:12:12,594 --> 00:12:17,494
that he was the grandson Shota of Mrs. Iwae Tanaka.

239
00:12:18,094 --> 00:12:20,994
So, when you say he just wanted to hide his name,

240
00:12:20,994 --> 00:12:23,094
do you mean that he's not the killer?

241
00:12:23,094 --> 00:12:24,994
Yeah, that's right.

242
00:12:28,894 --> 00:12:30,294
But, just a while ago you said that,

243
00:12:30,294 --> 00:12:34,094
the killer skillfully used something from this house, didn't you?

244
00:12:34,094 --> 00:12:36,794
So, even if you don't know the details of the house,

245
00:12:36,794 --> 00:12:38,694
it's something that can be used as a weapon

246
00:12:38,694 --> 00:12:41,394
so long as you look at it and know what it is.

247
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,594
If that certain thing is used along

248
00:12:43,594 --> 00:12:45,394
with my hammer that was stolen.

249
00:12:45,394 --> 00:12:47,594
Hammer?

250
00:12:47,594 --> 00:12:50,994
Remember? Ayumi seemed to be worried about it.

251
00:12:50,994 --> 00:12:53,294
Me?

252
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:55,694
You asked whether the water in the aquarium decreased in one night

253
00:12:55,694 --> 00:12:58,694
because the goldfish drank the water.

254
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,494
But, that wasn't it.

255
00:13:01,494 --> 00:13:04,394
Something that was inside the aquarium was taken out.

256
00:13:04,394 --> 00:13:07,994
-Huh? -So, what's that something?

257
00:13:07,994 --> 00:13:11,194
It was used frequently as a weapon

258
00:13:11,194 --> 00:13:13,694
during the Jomon Period.

259
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:18,194
Obsidian.

260
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,419
Obsidian, you say...

261
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:28,319
Right. If you shatter it,

262
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:31,419
it becomes quite a sharp piece of knife-like object.

263
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:35,119
The killer used it to slash Akane's throat.

264
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:38,519
You... you say that the obsidian was used as a knife?

265
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,119
And...

266
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:43,419
The thing that was used to shatter it was my hammer.

267
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:45,019
The place it was shattered was in the forest

268
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:47,819
where the hammer was found.

269
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:51,519
But no one would hear the loud sound of the stone being shattered.

270
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:55,419
I'm sure that weapon was made in the middle of the night

271
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:57,919
before it started raining.

272
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,419
That's why no footprints were found.

273
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:01,719
I see.

274
00:14:01,719 --> 00:14:05,219
And, who is it? The killer that did it?

275
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,519
That's...

276
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:09,519
The one who saw the stone in the aquarium

277
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,219
and immediately took it to be an obsidian,

278
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:13,719
Mr. Raito Adachi.

279
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,519
You're the one who did it.

280
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,419
What...

281
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,519
Please wait a minute.

282
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,219
I'm made a killer

283
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:26,319
just because I'm knowledgeable about stones.

284
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:30,719
I'm sure that granny and Fuga also knew that the stone was an obsidian.

285
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:32,619
And yet, why me?

286
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:36,019
I turned my attention to you

287
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:37,019
when I saw your shoes.

288
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:38,719
Shoes?

289
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:40,619
If you hear the scream of a woman

290
00:14:40,619 --> 00:14:43,119
you know very well from outside,

291
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:46,119
I wonder if there's a person who will attempt to wear his shoes?

292
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:49,919
-Huh? -It's quite troublesome to wear shoes.

293
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,019
The entrance of this house has a step,

294
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:54,919
so first you have to find your shoes,

295
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:58,019
then put your feet inside and get your heels into them too.

296
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:00,319
In the circumstance back then,

297
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:02,219
it's most likely that you don't wear shoes and run up to the door,

298
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:04,819
then check what's going on outside.

299
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:10,319
Just like Conan, granny and her grandson did.

300
00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:13,319
But, you had your high-cut shoes on

301
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:16,519
and had your shoe strings tied nicely as well.

302
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:19,219
In other words, you didn't go out to see what was going on

303
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:21,519
but rather was there to begin with

304
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,219
and murdered Akane on the site.

305
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:25,919
That's what your shoes proved.

306
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,119
I can see that he is a probable suspect,

307
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:34,619
but I wonder if his having his shoes on is enough to call him the killer.

308
00:15:34,619 --> 00:15:37,919
Like I said, I turned my attention to him

309
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:39,019
when I saw his shoes.

310
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:40,219
Attention?

311
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:43,319
What concluded my deduction as him being the killer is the hammer!

312
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:47,719
Hammer... but we don't know who stole it yet.

313
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:51,919
If granny or her grandson were going to make a weapon,

314
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:54,119
they would most likely use something that is in this house.

315
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:58,019
Say for example something from the tool box that was in the shed.

316
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:00,119
Although the bag was left out in the corridor,

317
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:03,119
who knows when someone may get up.

318
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:06,719
Therefore, no one would dare take the hammer out of my bag.

319
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:09,519
I see, very true.

320
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,219
Just as you were saying,

321
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:14,619
the killer most probably decided to commit the murder

322
00:16:14,619 --> 00:16:16,319
despite this being a trip and the number of people being limited,

323
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:20,519
but something happened last night that provoked the murder.

324
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,919
And, I don't know what kind of reason he used

325
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:28,119
but he lured Akane outside early in the morning.

326
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:31,719
Since no sound of argument or fighting was heard,

327
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:35,819
Akane probably agreed to leaving her room.

328
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:38,919
They got to the front entrance without anybody noticing them,

329
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,619
completely wore their shoes

330
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:43,719
and just when they were about to go outside, something happened.

331
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:45,219
Something? What was that?

332
00:16:45,219 --> 00:16:48,619
Maybe Akane who came along willingly up to that time

333
00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:50,719
realized that it was raining

334
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,919
and decided that she didn't want to go out.

335
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:56,119
Or, she may have sensed that something was wrong

336
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:59,119
when she heard Mitsuhiko's footsteps as he ran up the stairs.

337
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,019
What makes you so sure?

338
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:04,619
If not, nothing would've happened at the front entrance.

339
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:08,319
He probably didn't plan on killing her there.

340
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,319
You decided to killer there because you panicked.

341
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:14,219
You probably went out struggling with Akane,

342
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:16,219
slashed her throat with the weapon you had hiding on you,

343
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:18,219
and killed her.

344
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:26,519
After that you left Akane's body at the site,

345
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:28,519
ran back to the house,

346
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:30,019
after opening the sliding paper door beside the aquarium,

347
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:32,519
you headed outside once again.

348
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,619
You ran over to Akane who was lying on the ground

349
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:36,019
and carried her up.

350
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:39,419
He put on an act to make it look

351
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,919
as if he ran out after hearing her scream.

352
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,619
Because he had no way of hiding the blood

353
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:45,519
that was on his clothes and body.

354
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:47,419
Then...

355
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:49,519
where is the weapon?

356
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:51,519
If it hasn't been found yet,

357
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:54,619
it's probably still in the aquarium.

358
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:57,119
Just before you mentioned that you wanted to go the bathroom

359
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,919
to wash off her blood from yourself,

360
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,119
you were touching the aquarium,

361
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:03,319
so you probably put it in there then.

362
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:06,919
You most surely didn't have time to wipe it off,

363
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,019
so I'm sure it's still on the murder weapon,

364
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:12,819
Akane's blood and your fingerprints.

365
00:18:16,219 --> 00:18:18,919
Having had it explained like that...

366
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:20,119
How about you?

367
00:18:21,619 --> 00:18:24,919
Yes, I feel bad

368
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:26,719
towards those goldfish.

369
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:28,719
Goldfish?

370
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:30,519
I should be, shouldn't I?

371
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:33,519
I messed up their habitat

372
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:36,719
to kill a worthless woman like her.

373
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:38,519
But why?

374
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:41,819
Wasn't she one of your important customers?

375
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:46,019
I was planning to quit as a host in the near future.

376
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:47,319
Because my parents finally...

377
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:50,119
were about to repay the entire amount of money

378
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:52,919
they borrowed from the financial institution run by her father.

379
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:55,319
However, last night that woman...

380
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:57,019
Oh, the money that they borrowed

381
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:59,219
has ballooned to about three times what they originally borrowed.

382
00:18:59,219 --> 00:19:01,019
-Huh? -I told your parents

383
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:03,219
that were some shares that would prospectively go up

384
00:19:03,219 --> 00:19:05,219
and they fell for it.

385
00:19:05,219 --> 00:19:07,819
I'm sure that they're looking pale right now,

386
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:10,819
because the shares of that company took a sharp plunge

387
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:13,519
after the president was arrested.

388
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,219
But, I've got to thank God over and over again

389
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:20,519
because now you'll be at my beck

390
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:22,819
and call for life, Raito.

391
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:29,519
I burst out in rage when that woman said that.

392
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:31,119
I was working as a host

393
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,919
because I had no choice having to pay back money.

394
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:35,119
So, I really had it tough.

395
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:39,119
I've always been a very old-fashioned person.

396
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,819
So, this job of having to be at the back and call of women,

397
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:43,619
wasn't my cup of tea.

398
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:46,119
But, I didn't think I'd be using...

399
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:49,219
such an outdated weapon to commit the murder.

400
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:55,619
I'll leave the rest to you.

401
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:57,519
Yes, sir!

402
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:00,719
What about this knife with the red handle?

403
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:03,419
Oh, I'll put that back.

404
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:07,519
Excuse me.

405
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:09,919
May I please take a look at that knife for a minute?

406
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,619
Go ahead.

407
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:12,719
Thank you.

408
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:16,219
"Shota"

409
00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:18,319
This is...

410
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:20,719
Hey, young man...

411
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:24,719
if you know my grandson, please relay this message to him.

412
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:27,919
Tell him not to worry about me.

413
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,119
But, to above all take care of his body

414
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:34,419
and to take good care of himself.

415
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,919
Yeah, I'll relay your message to him.

416
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,319
So in exchange,

417
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:46,519
may I take this knife with me?

418
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:50,019
Because I'm sure that he'll really be happy if I give it to him.

419
00:20:51,219 --> 00:20:54,119
Yeah, do that.

420
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:00,919
Huh? Did that granny know he was her grandson?

421
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:03,219
Yeah, most probably.

422
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:06,019
That's why she kept that knife hidden.

423
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:07,719
She was probably going to give it to him

424
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:10,219
when he came back a fine chef,

425
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:14,019
and kept polishing it every day very preciously.

426
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:16,919
But, she really looked as frightening as an ogre

427
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:18,419
as she was sharpening the knife.

428
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:20,719
It's just like the mask of the Hanya.

429
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:22,319
It looks scary

430
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:24,419
but at the same time you could say it looks sad, right?

431
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:28,319
I'm sure that she was sharpening it with all her might

432
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,219
while trying to hold back the pain she was feeling in her heart.

433
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:34,819
She probably polished the knife with the hope

434
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:37,719
that her grandson whose appearance and intention have changed

435
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:40,619
to return to where he started off.

436
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:45,119
The glitter of the mountain crone's knife

437
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:47,419
was the sad glitter

438
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:50,119
of the tears of a grandmother concerned about her grandson.

439
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:22,619
A month later,

440
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:24,919
I went to a Japanese restaurant with Ran.

441
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:27,919
I happened to see a young cook being scolded.

442
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,919
Too slow, Tanaka!

443
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,319
You still haven't finished cutting it?

444
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,819
I'm sorry.

445
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:37,419
The young cook who looked familiar

446
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:40,319
was trying with all his might to fillet a fish.

447
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:43,419
That cook was holding a knife with a red handle in his hand.

448
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:46,919
I'm sure that one day he will certainly...

449
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:49,719
Conan...

450
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:53,019
Too slow, Conan,

451
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:54,719
you still can't decide what you want?

452
00:23:57,219 --> 00:24:00,119
She looked like a witch.

453
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:49,119
Next Conan's Hint:

454
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:51,419
Last train of the day.

455
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:53,019
Chief, we'd better get going soon or you'll miss the last train.

456
00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:54,919
Who cares, give me another glass of cider.

457
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:55,919
On the rocks.
