1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,670
What lies in one's heart is a mystery to us all.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,570
Star and snow glitter on the two.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,370
The tension in the courtroom is rising.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,370
What will happen to Pops' family and the couple's case?

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,870
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,670
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,770
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,030
Attorney Eri Kisaki, Ran's mother

9
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,830
accepts to defend the suspect of a murder case

10
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,930
that is in the charge of Reiko Kujo,

11
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,930
who is also known as the Madonna prosecutor.

12
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,430
Of all things the one who has

13
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,230
the key to the alibi of defendant Usami

14
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,930
who was charged with murder, is Pops.

15
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,330
And worse yet,

16
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,030
he was summoned to court as a witness for the prosecutor.

17
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:34,630
"Battle in Court, Kisaki vs. Kogoro (Part 2)"

18
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,930
"The Tokyo District Court"

19
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,830
Mr. Mouri.

20
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,330
Where and what were you doing

21
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,730
on the night the incident happened?

22
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,730
I was drinking sake at the restaurant

23
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,930
called Mimasu located in Haido-cho.

24
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,430
At there, you drunk two cups of Sake

25
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,430
and you fell asleep on the counter of the bar.

26
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,430
That's right.

27
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,430
Do you remember what time you got up?

28
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,930
It was 21:25.

29
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,730
How did you find out what time it was?

30
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,230
I got a call on my cell phone just as I was dozing off,

31
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,730
so the shopkeeper woke me up.

32
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,730
When I looked the watch on my cell phone, it showed 21:25.

33
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:31,930
And were there any other customers at that time?

34
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,130
I was there alone,

35
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,530
but since the reception of my cell phone wasn't too good,

36
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,530
I was heading outside

37
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,230
when a man came as I was going out.

38
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,730
Do you remember how he looked?

39
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,330
Of course.

40
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,030
It's that man over there, defendant Shinji Usami.

41
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,330
What?

42
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,930
What does this all mean?

43
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,930
Why would the prosecution

44
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,430
want to prove he alibi of the defendant?

45
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,230
I don't know.

46
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,230
I'm sure she's up to something though.

47
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,930
I was surprised because he took

48
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,330
the witness stand for the prosecutor,

49
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,130
but dad is on mom's side after all.

50
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,630
Yeah, I guess so.

51
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,430
For now, that is.

52
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,430
That's all for now.

53
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,330
You may cross-examine the witness now, counsel.

54
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,230
Thank you, sir.

55
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,430
All right, Mr. Mouri.

56
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,330
Do you remember until around what time

57
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,230
the suspect Mr. Usami was at Mimasu?

58
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,330
I'm sure he was there for 30 minutes,

59
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,830
so I think he stayed till about 22:00.

60
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,430
In other words, the suspect was at Mimasu from 21:30 to 22:00,

61
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:42,530
the hours that the victim is estimated to have been killed?

62
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,930
Well, I guess so.

63
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,130
That will be all.

64
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,330
-Which means that the witness... -Your honor.

65
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,830
May I ask one last question, your honor?

66
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,530
-Granted. -Thank you.

67
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,930
Mr. Mouri.

68
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,530
You stated a while ago that you were awakened

69
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,230
by the owner of Mimasu after you doze off.

70
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,230
Yes.

71
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:14,030
Then, where was your cell phone at that time?

72
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,430
Here it comes!

73
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,130
Of course it was inside the inner pocket of my coat

74
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,030
that was on the clothes rack inside the counter.

75
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,930
Which means that

76
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,730
it would've been possible for someone to fool around

77
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:34,330
with the time display of your cell phone while you were asleep.

78
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,530
Let's say for example, the owner of the shop.

79
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,730
-No way. -Objection, your honor!

80
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,730
The remark the prosecutor just made

81
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,330
is mere speculation.

82
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:48,330
Prosecutor, please base your remarks only on facts.

83
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,430
Yes, sir.

84
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,830
Your honor, I would like to call on another witness,

85
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,530
the former wife of the defendant

86
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,330
as well as the owner of restaurant Mimasu,

87
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,330
Mrs. Masako Kameda.

88
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,130
She got us.

89
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,030
Ms. Kisaki...

90
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,430
It's my mistake for being overly concerned about his alibi

91
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,330
and failing to check into the details.

92
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,230
What on earth is going on, Conan?

93
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,430
So long as the cell phone wasn't in Pops hand,

94
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,430
the defendant's alibi is invalid.

95
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:30,330
In other words, someone could've fooled around

96
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,630
with the watch of his cell phone.

97
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,930
Call Pops at any time, then wake him up,

98
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,630
to make him confirm what time it is.

99
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,730
Next, all that has to be done is change the time back again

100
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,730
when Pops takes his eyes off the cell phone again.

101
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:49,730
It is possible for the owner of Mimasu to do that.

102
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,330
But...

103
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,930
Right. Your mom, just like you

104
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,630
was already under the impression

105
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,830
that the two were not on good terms with each other

106
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,430
so Ms. Kisaki didn't even think that the owner of Mimasu

107
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,230
would cooperate in establishing an alibi for the defendant.

108
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,930
But...

109
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,930
Mrs. Masako Kameda.

110
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,830
On the night of the incident,

111
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,230
didn't you change the time

112
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,230
on the cell phone of Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

113
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,430
Well?

114
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,730
By the way, if lie under oath,

115
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,730
you could be accused of perjury.

116
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,530
Masako?

117
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,830
It's just as...

118
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,830
It's just as you say, prosecutor.

119
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,830
Then, you admit to having changed the time

120
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,630
on Mr. Mouri's cell phone?

121
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,630
Yes.

122
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,830
What time was it actually when the defendant Usami

123
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,830
came to your shop as Mr. Mouri went out?

124
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,430
I moved the clock 30 minutes,

125
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,030
so I think it was about 21:55.

126
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,030
Your honor. The scene of the crime

127
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,930
and the shop of the witness is only about 10 minutes on foot,

128
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,030
which means the defendant had more than enough time

129
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,830
to carry out the crime.

130
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,430
Would the defense like to question the witness?

131
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,130
Just one question.

132
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,930
Masako.

133
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,730
When I asked you to talk to me before this trial,

134
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,330
if I remember correctly,

135
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,230
I'm sure you said you hated the defendant.

136
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,330
So why would you take on such a task

137
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,130
as making up and alibi for him?

138
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,330
I don't know.

139
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,130
That will be all.

140
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,230
"Tokyo Prison"

141
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,430
Mr. Usami.

142
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,830
Is what your wife testified in court true?

143
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,430
How strange, though.

144
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,330
If you asked your wife to make up an alibi for you,

145
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,930
why didn't you use it?

146
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,230
As I've already told you,

147
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:12,430
you've got to tell me the whole truth.

148
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:17,330
Otherwise, I can't go on defending you anymore.

149
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,330
I don't need anyone to defend me anymore.

150
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,930
Just what are you talking about?

151
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,230
I'm the one who killed Hirasawa!

152
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,230
Just hurry up and shove me into jail or whatever!

153
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,630
Yes, Mouri Detective Office.

154
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,730
Oh, Officer Takagi.

155
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,830
And how was it?

156
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,130
Yeah...

157
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,030
And what about Usami's current address?

158
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,730
Pops...

159
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,030
Yeah... Okay, I got it.

160
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,730
Thanks for everything.

161
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,630
I'll treat you to a drink later. Bye then.

162
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,430
Conan, I'm going to go out for a while.

163
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,230
Bye.

164
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,730
Police report on the Hirasawa case.

165
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,030
I thought so.

166
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,730
I'm back.

167
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,230
Huh?

168
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,930
Conan, where's dad?

169
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,730
Hey, Conan!

170
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,230
Iidako in his stomach?

171
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,530
What's this?

172
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,980
Hey, Conan!

173
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,580
"Usami's Condominium"

174
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,980
Where shall I start?

175
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,680
Pops.

176
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,980
Conan? How come you're here?

177
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,880
Ran told me to keep an eye on you

178
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,480
so the prosecutor doesn't take advantage of you again.

179
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,480
Gosh, she's got to learn to trust her father a bit more.

180
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,280
Don't you got messing the place around too much.

181
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,480
Yes, sir!

182
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,480
So, he's Masaki.

183
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,680
What's this?

184
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,680
This is the match of Mimasu.

185
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,480
Why would something like this be here?

186
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,580
Pops, was there an ashtray in this room?

187
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,980
Huh?

188
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,580
Come to think of it, I haven't seen any.

189
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,080
Usami probably doesn't smoke.

190
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,180
But look, there's a match box here.

191
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,280
This is the match box of Mimasu.

192
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,880
If so, it's not odd that it's here.

193
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,680
But, wasn't he on bad terms with his wife?

194
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,580
Then why?

195
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,880
Married couples go through a lot of complicated feelings,

196
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,080
although it may be hard for a kid like you to understand.

197
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,980
Seriously.

198
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,580
This is...

199
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,040
Excuse me.

200
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,040
Is there iidako in the oden today too?

201
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,540
Hi, sonny.

202
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,740
Yes.

203
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,640
After all, it's one of the specialties of this shop,

204
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,840
so I can't do without it.

205
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,040
Do you like it, sonny?

206
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,440
Yes, because it's so delicious!

207
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,440
All right, then I'll give you some.

208
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
All right! Thank you!

209
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,240
You're welcome.

210
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,940
You've got that picture too, don't you?

211
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,040
-Huh? -I saw it in Mr. Usami's room, too.

212
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,840
I see.

213
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,140
What? Making him take the witness stand again?

214
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,340
Yes, he says he goofed it the last time,

215
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,640
so he'd like to be given a chance to make up for it this time.

216
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,040
But, with the alibi invalid and all,

217
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,340
what difference is Mr. Mouri standing witness going to do?

218
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,940
It seems to have something to do with the blank time,

219
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,540
that he talked about last time.

220
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,240
And he also said you'd understand if I show you this.

221
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,940
This is the match box of Mimasu, isn't it?

222
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,340
This is...

223
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,640
This and another thing.

224
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,940
He said take a good look at the contents

225
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,040
that was in the victim's stomach.

226
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,640
The contents in his stomach...

227
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,040
Ms. Kisaki...

228
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,040
"The 3rd courtroom"

229
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,640
Then, Mr. Mouri,

230
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,740
let me confirm what happened that night once again.

231
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,540
Around what time did you go to Mimasu?

232
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,340
About 19:30, like I always do.

233
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,940
And when did you doze off?

234
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,840
20:30.

235
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,440
In other words, you were sleeping from 20:30

236
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,640
to the actual time you were awakened at 21:55?

237
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,440
Yeah, I guess so.

238
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,840
Just what is Ms. Kisaki trying to get at?

239
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,740
I wonder. I guess she just being a bad sport.

240
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,040
Which means that

241
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,740
no matter what happened inside the shop at that time,

242
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,240
you wouldn't have noticed, right?

243
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,440
Just what are you trying to get at anyway?

244
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,440
Let's say, even if Mr. Usami were to have brought the victim

245
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,040
to the shop while you were asleep.

246
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,940
Objection, your honor!

247
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,340
That's just groundless guess work!

248
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,140
I do have something to stand on.

249
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,140
Please take a good look at the victim's autopsy report.

250
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:59,540
There should be iidako inside the contents of his stomach.

251
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,140
Mimasu always has iidako

252
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,940
being that it is one of their specialties.

253
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,540
By the way, I checked with

254
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,240
all the restaurants in the vicinity and found that

255
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,140
there is no other shop that includes iidako in their menu

256
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,140
except for Mimasu.

257
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,440
Let's say it was as the defense claims

258
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,340
and the defendant did in fact visit Mimasu that night,

259
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,640
what difference does that make?

260
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,540
It makes a great difference!

261
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,440
Because it means that the victim has met someone

262
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,440
other than the defendant that has the motive to commit murder.

263
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,640
Hey! The only customer that was there back then was me!

264
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,940
The person didn't have to be a customer, right?

265
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,240
What?

266
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,840
Don't tell me...

267
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,340
Don't be ridiculous!

268
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,240
I, Kogoro Mouri, will guarantee that

269
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,140
the owner of Mimasu would never do such a thing...

270
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,440
Thinking something like that is completely incorrect.

271
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,940
Dear?

272
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,240
The point that leads to the key to solving this case is

273
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,640
the actual kind of relationship the defendant Usami

274
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,640
and his wife Masako had with each other.

275
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,740
It is true that

276
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,840
the relationship between the two became quite hostile

277
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,240
to the point of getting a divorce

278
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,940
after they lost their beloved son by accident?

279
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,440
But they also believed that

280
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,040
the man Hirasawa was to blame for the entire incident.

281
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,740
And that night,

282
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,140
defendant Usami ran into the very person

283
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,640
who had torn them apart and got into an argument.

284
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,940
After the argument,

285
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,940
they were chased out of the shop at 20:30.

286
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,040
The defendant took Mr. Hirasawa

287
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,740
to Mimasu where Masako was.

288
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,540
Well, I guess you could say,

289
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,340
he coincidentally ran into the guy

290
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,340
he had held a grudge against for years,

291
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,440
and didn't know what to do,

292
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,040
so he took the victim over to his ex-wife's shop.

293
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,540
And that was about a little past 20:45.

294
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,340
On the other hand, Masako,

295
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,440
who sees Hirasawa right before her eyes,

296
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,240
finds that all the flames of hatred

297
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,440
that she had almost forgotten revives within her.

298
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,140
So, she sends the defendant home

299
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,740
and lures Hirasawa out to the construction site,

300
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,340
which after she kills him.

301
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,640
After that she rushes back to Mimasu,

302
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,140
sees me asleep and goes ahead to establish her false alibi.

303
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,440
In other words, the false alibi that the prosecutor saw through

304
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,840
was not for the defendant,

305
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,840
but rather actually of Masako!

306
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,040
Just as expected of a detective!

307
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,640
Your story is very well made up indeed.

308
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,040
However, this happens to be a courtroom

309
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,240
and not a place to make people

310
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,540
listen to your fantastic deductions.

311
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,440
This is a place to battle truth against truth.

312
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,640
Do you happen to disagree with my deduction?

313
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,940
First of all, how do you know that

314
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,640
the defendant went home while leaving the victim behind?

315
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,140
How can you tell that he didn't ask his wife

316
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:00,040
to make up his alibi and then take the victim out himself?

317
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,340
If so, then the defendant should be

318
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,340
insisting on his alibi to begin with, right?

319
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,740
Another thing.

320
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,840
How are you going to explain the car key of the defendant

321
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,540
that was found at the site?

322
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,440
That's simple.

323
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,540
The defendant himself put it near the corpse.

324
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,540
Although the defendant left the shop alone,

325
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,940
he probably got worried and returned to the shop.

326
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,640
There, he runs into

327
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,640
the site where Masako had killed Hirasawa.

328
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,240
The defendant probably thought as follows.

329
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,340
That it would be better for him

330
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,040
to be accused of homicide on the grounds

331
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,540
that he was drunk, rather than his wife being charged.

332
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,640
Maybe he thought that

333
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,840
just like Hirasawa who had killed his son,

334
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,640
he would be able to get away with a lighter sentence.

335
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,840
That's ridiculous.

336
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,340
A sentence doesn't always get lighter

337
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,640
just because a person is drunk, you know?

338
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,840
It could be the opposite

339
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,340
and the person could be charged with a heavier crime.

340
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,340
That's because the defendant loves his wife even now.

341
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,440
And because Masako deep down inside still loves him, too.

342
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,240
As proof of this...

343
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,440
This is the match of Mimasu.

344
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,640
On the back side, Mimasu is written in romaji.

345
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,140
What kind of proof are saying it is?

346
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,940
Right. If you read this from the opposite end in romaji,

347
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,740
it reads Usami M.

348
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,640
In other words, it's the name of their son Masaki

349
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,940
and her name before she got divorced

350
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,440
back in the days, when they were a happy family.

351
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,340
And the defendant after seeing that match,

352
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,940
found out how she really felt

353
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,840
so he went out of his way to take the blame for the murder

354
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,040
in order to save his wife.

355
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,040
That's a lie! I'm the one who killed that guy!

356
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,640
It's a lie that my wife did it!

357
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,640
I killed him with my very hands...

358
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,540
I killed Hirasawa with these hands!

359
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,340
Stop it already, dear.

360
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,140
It's all right.

361
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,140
I understand very well how you feel now.

362
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,540
I'm so sorry that I testified the way I did.

363
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,040
I didn't know anything at all about the key.

364
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,440
Just as Mr. Mouri has pointed out,

365
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,840
I'm the one who killed Hirasawa.

366
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,440
Masako.

367
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,840
He had forgotten who I was.

368
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:22,740
Haven't we met somewhere before?

369
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,340
Huh? With you?

370
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,540
Nope, I don't think so.

371
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:31,340
Because I'd never forget an attractive woman like you.

372
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,940
Is that so?

373
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,840
He messed up and broke our family up,

374
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,140
yet he doesn't even remember how I look.

375
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,940
I just couldn't forgive him!

376
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,740
Masako...

377
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,840
A couple mutually trying to protect each other

378
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,940
at first glance looks beautiful.

379
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,640
However, a crime is a crime.

380
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,840
If you really love your wife,

381
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,240
you should help her get back on her feet

382
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,740
after she makes amends for what she did.

383
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,940
Don't you think that's what real love is all about?

384
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,840
I was completely beaten today.

385
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,240
I lost completely.

386
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,340
Besides, to have my case turned around like that

387
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,940
not by the defense attorney, but the witness

388
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,740
is a first time experience for me.

389
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,040
I guess, same here.

390
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,540
I'll see you in the courtroom again with the next case.

391
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,440
Take it easy on me then, will you?

392
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,040
Same here.

393
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,540
I need you to keep up

394
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,240
your successive victory record yet, Ms. Kisaki.

395
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,440
Huh?

396
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,440
It's my mission to throw dirt on her.

397
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,740
Dear, thank you for everything today.

398
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,540
I guess I'll thank you for now.

399
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,940
Huh?

400
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:20,440
And about after this,

401
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,440
if you have some time,

402
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,440
why don't we go to a restaurant for a meal?

403
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,640
Then, we can take our time and talk...

404
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,340
Miss.

405
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,640
If it's okay with you,

406
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,640
would you let me take you out to eat something?

407
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,940
Dad!

408
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,840
He seems to be very busy right now,

409
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,240
so I guess we can go to dinner some other time.

410
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,840
Let's go, Ms. Kuriyama.

411
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,140
Yes!

412
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,240
Mother, wait!

413
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,840
Mother!

414
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,940
Seriously! Dad!

415
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,540
Well, well...

416
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,740
It's not going to work out the way Ran wants it to for a while.

417
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,380
Next Conan's Hint:

418
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,220
"Chocolate"
