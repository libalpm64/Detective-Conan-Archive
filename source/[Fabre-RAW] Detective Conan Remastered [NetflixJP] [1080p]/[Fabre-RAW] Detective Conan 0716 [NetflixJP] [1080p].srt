1
00:00:03,956 --> 00:00:07,356
We've safeguarded the plan double and triple fold.

2
00:00:07,356 --> 00:00:09,156
All preparations for making it look like an accident

3
00:00:09,156 --> 00:00:11,956
have been completed.

4
00:00:11,956 --> 00:00:16,456
I've prepared the poison quite some time ago already.

5
00:00:16,456 --> 00:00:21,656
Let's confirm if he has red blood flowing through him too.

6
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:24,856
Fortunately, the museum will be closed next Sunday.

7
00:00:24,856 --> 00:00:28,956
None of the staff beside us will show up.

8
00:00:28,956 --> 00:00:30,356
Great.

9
00:00:30,356 --> 00:00:33,056
The sooner the better.

10
00:00:33,056 --> 00:00:35,656
That reminds me, Mr. Seikanji.

11
00:00:35,656 --> 00:00:39,956
The deadline for repaying the loan is closing in, isn't it?

12
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:41,356
What...

13
00:00:41,356 --> 00:00:42,656
Look who's talking.

14
00:00:42,656 --> 00:00:44,956
I heard that you embezzled money, and it was exposed,

15
00:00:44,956 --> 00:00:48,456
so you're going to be fired at the end of this month.

16
00:00:48,456 --> 00:00:50,056
I don't want to be told that by a manager

17
00:00:50,056 --> 00:00:52,656
who fell for junk stocks and incurred a huge loss.

18
00:00:52,656 --> 00:00:54,956
So, I'm the only one

19
00:00:54,956 --> 00:00:59,356
that doesn't have to rush to finish things off.

20
00:00:59,356 --> 00:01:01,156
Is that so?

21
00:01:01,156 --> 00:01:04,656
As his ex-girlfriend, I'll bet you're worried about

22
00:01:04,656 --> 00:01:08,256
when your inheritance deed will go down the drain.

23
00:01:08,256 --> 00:01:13,556
Come now, there's no use arguing now.

24
00:01:13,556 --> 00:01:18,056
We've got only one common purpose to pursue.

25
00:01:18,056 --> 00:01:21,756
That is, to murder Jisaburo Izumi.

26
00:01:21,756 --> 00:01:26,156
That's why we're gathered here, aren't we?

27
00:01:26,156 --> 00:01:30,156
So, I'd like to confirm with you one more time, Moyono.

28
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:33,556
In case we succeed in murdering Jisaburo,

29
00:01:33,556 --> 00:01:36,956
we split half the inheritance that is due to you

30
00:01:36,956 --> 00:01:39,056
among us three.

31
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:42,856
The one who actually succeeds in killing him gets 80%,

32
00:01:42,856 --> 00:01:45,056
and the remaining two gets 10% each

33
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:47,956
to keep their mouths shut.

34
00:01:47,956 --> 00:01:51,656
I kind of feel like I'm the only one who's losing out.

35
00:01:51,656 --> 00:01:53,556
But, I guess it can't be helped.

36
00:01:53,556 --> 00:01:56,556
Because if I do it alone and fail,

37
00:01:56,556 --> 00:01:58,656
everything'll go to pieces.

38
00:01:58,656 --> 00:02:00,956
If all three of us pitch in, the odds of succeeding

39
00:02:00,956 --> 00:02:03,456
would be greater.

40
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:09,256
Okay. Then, we'll launch the plan next Sunday.

41
00:02:22,056 --> 00:02:23,956
Aim for a 100% solution.

42
00:02:23,956 --> 00:02:26,056
Clear all mysteries and codes.

43
00:02:26,056 --> 00:02:27,956
A dangerous conversation at the Noh Mask Museum.

44
00:02:27,956 --> 00:02:30,356
The secret of the threesome hiding behind the mask.

45
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:31,956
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:02:31,956 --> 00:02:33,756
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

47
00:02:33,756 --> 00:02:36,556
His name is Detective Conan!

48
00:04:17,152 --> 00:04:22,952
"The Ogre Dances in the Noh Mask Mansion (Part 1)"

49
00:04:30,852 --> 00:04:34,052
Huh? It seems to be closed today.

50
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:35,452
Oh, yeah.

51
00:04:36,252 --> 00:04:38,852
Never mind, this is an emergency.

52
00:04:40,652 --> 00:04:41,652
Yes?

53
00:04:41,652 --> 00:04:44,152
I would like to see the director!

54
00:04:44,152 --> 00:04:45,852
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:50,752
We're closed today so Director Izumi resting today.

56
00:04:50,752 --> 00:04:54,252
Excuse me. I'm Naruya Akaza.

57
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:57,352
I have an appointment with Mr. Izumi.

58
00:05:02,252 --> 00:05:05,252
Oh, Ms. Moyono Mibu?

59
00:05:05,252 --> 00:05:07,652
Long time no see.

60
00:05:09,252 --> 00:05:12,052
I'll open the front door right now.

61
00:05:20,852 --> 00:05:23,652
I can't let you in.

62
00:05:23,652 --> 00:05:25,452
Like I just told you a while ago,

63
00:05:25,452 --> 00:05:27,652
it's our day off today.

64
00:05:27,652 --> 00:05:29,652
No, please don't bother.

65
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:33,652
I came to see the director because of an emergency.

66
00:05:33,652 --> 00:05:34,852
The director?

67
00:05:34,852 --> 00:05:36,252
An emergency?

68
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:41,252
The fact is, I received this letter, you see.

69
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:45,752
That Jisaburo Izumi's life is in danger.

70
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:55,452
Jisaburo Izumi's life is in danger.

71
00:05:55,452 --> 00:05:59,452
The culprit will soon be carrying out his plan.

72
00:05:59,452 --> 00:06:03,152
I'd like you to take on this case, renown Detective Kogoro Mouri.

73
00:06:03,152 --> 00:06:06,152
The name of the sender isn't written.

74
00:06:06,152 --> 00:06:08,452
What shall we do, Dad?

75
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:11,352
That man called Izumi is rich, isn't he?

76
00:06:11,352 --> 00:06:14,652
If you prevent the crime from happening, Pops...

77
00:06:14,652 --> 00:06:17,052
Okay! Let's go, Ran!

78
00:06:17,052 --> 00:06:18,952
If I don't go after receiving a letter like that,

79
00:06:18,952 --> 00:06:21,852
I'd be hurting my reputation!

80
00:06:21,852 --> 00:06:24,252
I tell you, and you don't even know for sure

81
00:06:24,252 --> 00:06:26,752
if the letter is authentic or not.

82
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:29,852
All I really wanted to do is to go see the Noh masks!

83
00:06:31,252 --> 00:06:32,552
So, you see,

84
00:06:32,552 --> 00:06:35,552
I decided to stick my nose in and offer my services.

85
00:06:35,552 --> 00:06:37,452
And, you are?

86
00:06:37,452 --> 00:06:42,852
Oh, pardon me. Here's my business card.

87
00:06:42,852 --> 00:06:47,852
Oh! So, you're that famed detective, the Sleeping Kogoro!

88
00:06:47,852 --> 00:06:51,552
Well, I guess that's what people call me.

89
00:06:57,352 --> 00:07:01,352
I'm a long time acquaintance of Director Izumi.

90
00:07:01,352 --> 00:07:03,452
But to think you'd bring your children along

91
00:07:03,452 --> 00:07:05,452
when investigating a forewarning of murder.

92
00:07:05,452 --> 00:07:09,352
No, this kid is interested in seeing Noh masks.

93
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:10,552
I see.

94
00:07:10,552 --> 00:07:13,152
Your daughter has refined taste.

95
00:07:13,152 --> 00:07:16,052
Huh? Oh, thank you.

96
00:07:18,252 --> 00:07:21,552
I wonder where the word got out from?

97
00:07:21,552 --> 00:07:24,452
To think that the famed detective would come all the way here.

98
00:07:24,452 --> 00:07:27,952
I guess it'll be better to postpone our plan.

99
00:07:27,952 --> 00:07:30,452
Where's the director?

100
00:07:30,452 --> 00:07:33,752
It's just about time for him to go to worship the "Household God".

101
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:36,452
That's why Akaza's taking them there.

102
00:07:38,752 --> 00:07:41,452
We can't postpone the plan already.

103
00:07:41,452 --> 00:07:43,152
Huh?

104
00:07:43,152 --> 00:07:45,552
Don't tell me you set a trap up there?

105
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:47,452
This is bad.

106
00:07:50,952 --> 00:07:54,452
What's a household god?

107
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:56,952
In houses from the days of old, there is a tradition

108
00:07:56,952 --> 00:08:01,852
of worshipping ancestors on the northwest side of the premises.

109
00:08:01,852 --> 00:08:05,152
Is Mr. Izumi a religious character?

110
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:08,852
Well, there are many who resent him, you see.

111
00:08:08,852 --> 00:08:12,752
So he certainly has a good reason to pray.

112
00:08:12,752 --> 00:08:14,652
Oh, there he is.

113
00:08:14,652 --> 00:08:18,052
Good morning, Director Izumi!

114
00:08:18,452 --> 00:08:20,452
Mr. Akaza, eh?

115
00:08:20,452 --> 00:08:22,052
You're right on time.

116
00:08:22,052 --> 00:08:23,052
"Izumi Jisaburo (65), Noh Mask Museum Owner"

117
00:08:26,952 --> 00:08:30,352
"Toba Hatsuho (28), Jisaburo's Assigned Nurse"

118
00:08:30,352 --> 00:08:33,852
And? Who are you people?

119
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:47,552
I'm used to blackmail. So, leave me alone.

120
00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:51,352
Somebody took the trouble to send it over to my place, you know!

121
00:08:51,352 --> 00:08:54,152
It's hard to believe that this is a mere threat letter.

122
00:09:09,152 --> 00:09:10,452
Take cover!

123
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:15,052
Quick, behind there!

124
00:09:46,952 --> 00:09:49,752
If these children weren't here,

125
00:09:49,752 --> 00:09:52,952
I would've been crushed under the lumber.

126
00:09:52,952 --> 00:09:56,552
Hurry and get me a spare wheelchair!

127
00:09:56,552 --> 00:09:58,752
Yes, right away, sir!

128
00:09:58,752 --> 00:10:00,852
Not you.

129
00:10:00,852 --> 00:10:02,352
Hurry it up, will you?

130
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,652
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

131
00:10:13,552 --> 00:10:16,652
Darn! That old fart devil has the devil's luck.

132
00:10:22,152 --> 00:10:25,552
You can't trust anybody these days.

133
00:10:25,552 --> 00:10:31,752
But I'll trust you sonny because you saved me.

134
00:10:31,752 --> 00:10:34,452
And, you too, young lady.

135
00:10:35,952 --> 00:10:40,352
Sir, you never know what'll happen in the world today.

136
00:10:40,352 --> 00:10:42,452
Being on guard is top priority.

137
00:10:42,452 --> 00:10:44,952
Yep, that's for sure.

138
00:10:44,952 --> 00:10:47,252
And? What do I have to be on guard about?

139
00:10:47,252 --> 00:10:51,252
For example, what're those things decorated there?

140
00:10:54,052 --> 00:10:56,952
"Ju" and "Odoshi".

141
00:10:56,952 --> 00:11:00,452
"Ju" is a belt like shaped braided rope used for decoration.

142
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:03,052
"Odoshi" is part of the armor.

143
00:11:03,052 --> 00:11:06,552
Then, they're both strong, aren't they?

144
00:11:06,552 --> 00:11:08,752
What're you getting at?

145
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,152
Huh? A bee?

146
00:11:10,152 --> 00:11:11,352
It's big.

147
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:13,852
I'm going to be killed!

148
00:11:13,852 --> 00:11:15,652
No need to get so overly excited.

149
00:11:15,652 --> 00:11:17,752
That's not it. It's a hornet.

150
00:11:17,752 --> 00:11:20,352
Director Izumi's been stung once before.

151
00:11:20,352 --> 00:11:24,352
Bad! He may die of allergic shock!

152
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:28,552
There's another one?

153
00:11:34,952 --> 00:11:38,452
Why, you! How about this? And this?

154
00:11:39,652 --> 00:11:42,352
Hey, that's my jacket...

155
00:11:46,552 --> 00:11:49,152
What do you think, Mr. Sleeping Kogoro,

156
00:11:49,152 --> 00:11:51,452
of my prized collections?

157
00:11:51,452 --> 00:11:55,452
Well, they're all fantastic masks.

158
00:11:55,452 --> 00:11:57,552
Do you think it matches me too?

159
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:03,252
In order to create a quiet Noh atmosphere,

160
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:07,152
the staff as a general rule, wear Noh masks.

161
00:12:07,152 --> 00:12:09,152
This is called the "Kuwaemen".

162
00:12:09,152 --> 00:12:11,152
You can wear this mask just by biting on this

163
00:12:11,152 --> 00:12:13,152
and holding it in your mouth.

164
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:15,752
You can't talk when wearing it, though.

165
00:12:15,752 --> 00:12:17,452
That's why the director says

166
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:20,452
you can maintain a quiet Noh atmosphere.

167
00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:22,452
The maker of the mask was a man

168
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:25,352
called Kodo Matsumoto, my best friend.

169
00:12:25,352 --> 00:12:28,352
He repeated marrying and remarrying several times.

170
00:12:28,352 --> 00:12:32,552
And, I eventually ended up taking care of him until he passed away.

171
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:36,852
The director has an eye for good artists.

172
00:12:36,852 --> 00:12:38,452
In return for that, he entrusted

173
00:12:38,452 --> 00:12:42,052
the exhibition of his posthumous works to me.

174
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,952
The accident that occurred, and the hornet that came flying.

175
00:12:44,952 --> 00:12:47,252
The content of the letter was authentic, wasn't it?

176
00:12:55,452 --> 00:12:58,852
This museum was a mansion that originally

177
00:12:58,852 --> 00:13:01,052
belonged to my grandfather, you see.

178
00:13:01,052 --> 00:13:03,252
The only thing that is left even now

179
00:13:03,252 --> 00:13:06,852
is this Japanese hearth that is in the center of this mansion.

180
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,952
This called "Yokoza",

181
00:13:08,952 --> 00:13:11,752
the place where the head of the household sits.

182
00:13:11,752 --> 00:13:13,952
Sonny, do you know?

183
00:13:13,952 --> 00:13:15,652
Huh? Know what?

184
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:17,752
It's uncooked.

185
00:13:17,752 --> 00:13:19,452
That in the reflection of the light of the fire

186
00:13:19,452 --> 00:13:22,352
from the Japanese Hearth, the entire family enjoy chatting.

187
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:23,552
Then, see!

188
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,152
In the light of the fire the mask looks white, right?

189
00:13:26,152 --> 00:13:28,052
The word 'omoshiroi', meaning 'interesting',

190
00:13:28,052 --> 00:13:30,352
evolved from that.

191
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:33,152
Oh, that's interesting.

192
00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:38,552
Originally there was a grid called Hidana (rack)

193
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:41,052
in which a pot hanger was hooked onto.

194
00:13:41,052 --> 00:13:44,952
But, since it's not of much use now, it's stored.

195
00:13:44,952 --> 00:13:47,452
That wooden fish attachment

196
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,352
was thought to be a magical object that prevented fires.

197
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:21,866
Darn! Not again!

198
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:31,166
Darn that chestnut, for exploding at a time like that!

199
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:34,366
We all goofed together, didn't we?

200
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:37,066
Darn! Let's start from scratch!

201
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:44,166
Oh, so this is what we're having for lunch?

202
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,666
As a token of my appreciation for you having saved my life,

203
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,166
I catered all this.

204
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,166
Thank you so very much. Here goes...

205
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,266
It wasn't meant for you.

206
00:14:54,266 --> 00:14:57,066
The ones who saved me are the children!

207
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:02,766
This is just a little gift for you.

208
00:15:02,766 --> 00:15:05,966
It's washed-rind cheese from Bourgogne.

209
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:09,066
You just got back from France, didn't you?

210
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:11,666
I guess I'll open wine too, then.

211
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:17,966
Wow, it looks so delicious.

212
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:24,966
It's so smelly that it's known as "God's stink feet".

213
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:28,966
But, when you eat it, it tastes like rich milk.

214
00:15:28,966 --> 00:15:32,966
It's good manners to just scoop it with a spoon this way.

215
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:35,766
Chief, Manager, all of you,

216
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:37,266
come and get a taste of the gift too.

217
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:39,166
No, thank you, not for us.

218
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:42,466
Or are you confessing to being the culprit

219
00:15:42,466 --> 00:15:45,066
behind those three pranks?

220
00:15:45,066 --> 00:15:47,066
No way.

221
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:49,166
Then, we will do as you wish.

222
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,266
Yes, come, come.

223
00:15:51,266 --> 00:15:53,566
Choose to sit wherever you like.

224
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:55,166
If you eat it together with us,

225
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,566
you couldn't possibly poison it, could you?

226
00:15:57,566 --> 00:16:00,266
Hatsuho, will you act as a taster?

227
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:01,366
Yes, sir.

228
00:16:11,966 --> 00:16:13,366
It's delicious!

229
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,566
I'm sure it is.

230
00:16:16,566 --> 00:16:18,266
What do you think, Mr. Akaza,

231
00:16:18,266 --> 00:16:20,966
which wine would go better with it?

232
00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:24,066
I've got to taste it first to know.

233
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,266
Then, go on and take a bite too.

234
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:28,466
Thank you.

235
00:16:35,466 --> 00:16:38,466
Yes, it has a deep taste to it...

236
00:16:56,566 --> 00:16:59,566
This smells obviously of poison.

237
00:16:59,566 --> 00:17:01,466
It can't be.

238
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:03,266
Who and when was it laced with poison?

239
00:17:07,466 --> 00:17:10,366
Everybody, don't move.

240
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:12,466
Chief, where are you headed?

241
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,466
I'm going to call the police.

242
00:17:16,466 --> 00:17:20,966
I'll take care of that, so you all stay here.

243
00:17:20,966 --> 00:17:22,466
-Ran! -Yes.

244
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:26,566
Don't touch the cheese.

245
00:17:27,566 --> 00:17:28,966
Dad, no good.

246
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:31,866
This area seems to be out of service range.

247
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:34,166
The phone is in the kitchen over there.

248
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,066
I'll go make the call.

249
00:17:36,066 --> 00:17:37,966
Then, will you call Inspector Megure of MPD

250
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:39,966
and tell him that you're calling for Kogoro Mouri.

251
00:17:39,966 --> 00:17:40,966
Yes, sir.

252
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,566
Hello, is this the police?

253
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:47,266
One of our customers died an unnatural death.

254
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,266
Please rush over here.

255
00:17:50,466 --> 00:17:52,766
Even if the police cars were to speed over here,

256
00:17:52,766 --> 00:17:54,566
it would take them at least 20 minutes.

257
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:58,766
Do I have to stay sticky like this until then?

258
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:01,266
I guess you wouldn't want to be.

259
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:02,666
Was your name Ms. Toba?

260
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,066
Yes.

261
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:05,966
Can you just wipe the place around Mr. Izumi

262
00:18:05,966 --> 00:18:07,566
and leave the rest as is?

263
00:18:07,566 --> 00:18:08,866
All right.

264
00:18:08,866 --> 00:18:11,366
They say they'll be right over.

265
00:18:11,366 --> 00:18:13,066
Moyono Mibu...

266
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:16,166
She couldn't have put the poison in.

267
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:19,466
Chief Seikanji, Manager Nagata.

268
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:22,466
Those two didn't go near the cheese either.

269
00:18:22,466 --> 00:18:25,966
Ms. Toba was the taster, so at the time she tasted it,

270
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:28,766
there probably wasn't any poison in the cheese.

271
00:18:28,766 --> 00:18:30,466
If so, was it after that?

272
00:18:30,466 --> 00:18:34,066
No, nobody had time to do something like that.

273
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:38,166
If so, maybe the poison wasn't in the cheese,

274
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:41,566
but rather, on the butter knife?

275
00:18:41,566 --> 00:18:45,266
Miss, where was this butter knife?

276
00:18:45,266 --> 00:18:49,366
Huh? On each guest's plate.

277
00:18:49,366 --> 00:18:52,566
And without knowing who would sit where,

278
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:55,566
it would be impossible to target someone specifically.

279
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,966
Hey, kid, we're moving to different place!

280
00:19:07,366 --> 00:19:10,266
This is much safer.

281
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:12,366
Don't you agree, Mr. Mouri?

282
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:15,366
Very true.

283
00:19:15,366 --> 00:19:18,966
Please bear with me until the police get here.

284
00:19:18,966 --> 00:19:20,666
Huh? Ran.

285
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,366
Where's the brat?

286
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:25,266
Huh? I thought he was just there.

287
00:19:25,266 --> 00:19:27,766
I'll go get some coffee to serve Mr. Izumi.

288
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,066
I'll go look for the boy while I'm at it.

289
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:32,266
Oh, thanks so much.

290
00:19:35,566 --> 00:19:38,166
Something about the call she made to the police a while ago

291
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,466
was strange.

292
00:19:42,066 --> 00:19:44,766
This is an extension phone!

293
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:46,766
Sonny.

294
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,466
Are you there?

295
00:19:49,466 --> 00:19:50,566
Sonny?

296
00:19:51,966 --> 00:19:53,366
Sonny?

297
00:19:55,366 --> 00:19:56,966
That woman...

298
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:03,466
That's?

299
00:20:10,266 --> 00:20:12,066
Mouse! There's a mouse!

300
00:20:14,466 --> 00:20:16,666
Did you spill the coffee?

301
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,166
I'm sorry.

302
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:23,066
Mr. Izumi's asking if his coffee's ready yet.

303
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:24,866
Oh, right away!

304
00:20:24,866 --> 00:20:26,566
I'll help you!

305
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:28,066
No, thanks!

306
00:20:31,466 --> 00:20:34,766
I guess you had no time to put in the poison this time.

307
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:39,166
Which means that Mr. Akaza

308
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:42,166
had a reason for being murdered?

309
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,966
He used to enthusiastically flatter me,

310
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:47,666
but it seems he was doing evil business.

311
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,466
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

312
00:20:50,066 --> 00:20:53,866
I'm not ready to die like Akaza.

313
00:20:53,866 --> 00:20:56,466
Please don't joke like that.

314
00:20:56,466 --> 00:20:58,066
Don't worry.

315
00:20:58,066 --> 00:21:01,266
There's nobody who'll want to poison anyone to death

316
00:21:01,266 --> 00:21:03,666
when the police is on their way.

317
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,766
Well, that's true too.

318
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:13,966
Hey, Conan, that's an extension phone for sure.

319
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,766
I tell you! That father of mine

320
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:20,466
believes that the police'll be here any minute soon.

321
00:21:20,466 --> 00:21:22,766
At any rate, let's go look for a phone.

322
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,066
Yep! I found it, Conan.

323
00:21:29,466 --> 00:21:31,666
What seems to be the matter, Miss?

324
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:35,566
I've got to call the police right away.

325
00:21:35,566 --> 00:21:38,866
Huh? I'm sure that Ms. Mibu made the call already.

326
00:21:38,866 --> 00:21:42,366
She was just acting it out.

327
00:21:45,366 --> 00:21:46,866
Ran, run away!

328
00:21:49,566 --> 00:21:52,266
Don't you move either, Miss.

329
00:21:58,966 --> 00:22:01,366
So I said, aren't you gonna drink the whole thing?

330
00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:09,666
I'll bet it never dawned on you that

331
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,466
all three of us were accomplices.

332
00:22:11,466 --> 00:22:14,866
You stay put right there until we finish off the director.

333
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,466
So, you mean that person called Nagata is also one of them?

334
00:22:17,466 --> 00:22:18,666
Darn!

335
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:22,566
Director Izumi s life's in danger!

336
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,480
Next Conan's Hint:

337
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,620
"Chisel"
