1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,040
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,140
Black entanglement also unravels.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,840
A real case at a drama shoot.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,140
The murder weapon and suspect is nearby.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,940
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,560
Pops was asked to act as substitute

9
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,760
for doing the opening prologue of a detective drama.

10
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,860
He runs into a childhood friend of his, Ruri Ujo

11
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,760
who turned into a big name actress.

12
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,760
However...

13
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,560
Rurippe?

14
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,060
Kogoro.

15
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,960
"Invisible Suspect (Part 2)"

16
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,460
Darn it.

17
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,860
You smoke, Kogoro?

18
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,760
Yes. You don't smoke, Rurippe?

19
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,060
Did you forget about my father?

20
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,860
Oh, right. He was famous in the neighborhood as one that hated smokers.

21
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,060
Right!

22
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,360
Thanks to him, I hate cigarettes, too.

23
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,660
The same here.

24
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,060
But in my case, my mother hated cigarettes.

25
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,560
So, my father who was a heavy smoker

26
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,460
says that he was forced to quit as soon as I was born.

27
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:14,360
But what if you have to smoke in dramas?

28
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,160
I just hold the cigarette in my mouth at times like that.

29
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,160
Right, right.

30
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,760
We push the director and producer to do it our way.

31
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,260
That's why you can never be any greater than you father.

32
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,460
Kasumi.

33
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,960
Well, for a certain someone

34
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,360
who sells herself as a healer type actress...

35
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,860
it might be good for her health image.

36
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,860
Kasumi.

37
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,760
What's with her anyway?

38
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,760
She's jealous of me

39
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,160
because I'm talking intimately with him.

40
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,060
I think she's cute, don't you?

41
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,060
I see.

42
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,660
Just like the victim Mr. Kazami was saying,

43
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,960
it seems that they're going with each other.

44
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,560
Which means that

45
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,860
the lover he is secretly going out with is...

46
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,460
Have you already figured out who the killer is,

47
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,060
Mr. Renown Detective?

48
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,260
No, not yet.

49
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,560
Excuse me, Mr. Mouri.

50
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,260
May I have a word with you?

51
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,460
Sure.

52
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,160
Conan, where are you going?

53
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,060
To the men's room.

54
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,360
Don't bother the police officers, okay?

55
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,760
Okay!

56
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,060
What is it?

57
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,460
Just what are you up to?

58
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,760
Huh?

59
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,360
I'm asking you why you're making passes at her.

60
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,260
You mean Rurippe?

61
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,660
I'm not making passes. We're just childhood friends.

62
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,660
Are you sure that's all there is to it?

63
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,560
Is that honestly true?

64
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,560
Yes.

65
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,860
Okay then. But if you do anything funny,

66
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,960
I don't care if you're a renown detective or what, I won't forgive you.

67
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,160
Hey, hold it.

68
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,360
I feel as if I've gone through this sometime in the past, too.

69
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,160
If I'm not mistaken it was...

70
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,260
Hey, kid! What're you doing?

71
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,760
This tool box was left here in this room

72
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,760
together with the golf glove and coat too, right?

73
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,060
That's why I figured maybe there's something in here

74
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,860
besides a cutter knife that is capable of slashing things.

75
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,760
Playing detective is okay,

76
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,060
but the police checked every nook and cranny of this tool box.

77
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,260
Even this tape measure?

78
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,160
Yes.

79
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,460
Hey, who is it?

80
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,560
Who bamitted in a crummy place like this?

81
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,160
What does the "bamit" mean?

82
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,760
It means to mark the floor with masking.

83
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,360
It's done to indicate where the set is to be placed

84
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,960
or to determine the place where the actor is to stand.

85
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,760
Well, I guess the shooting is going to be called off.

86
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,360
So, I'll remove this for now.

87
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,660
Wait!

88
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,860
Something is fishy about the masking tape.

89
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,060
It's a little bloated

90
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,660
and something is stuck to the tip.

91
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,860
What is this?

92
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,560
A wire?

93
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,060
I see. I got it!

94
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,760
I've figured out what the murder weapon is.

95
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,460
As well as why we can't find it.

96
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,460
The room where the coat and the glove were is here

97
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,160
and the scene of the crime is diagonally beyond.

98
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,160
If from this room, the crime can be carried out easily.

99
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,560
All I need to figure out next is who did this.

100
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,660
Something's not right.

101
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,660
I can't figure out why Ruri suddenly invites everyone to go outside

102
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,560
after seeing the snow through the window.

103
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,760
Oh, no! Pops!

104
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,360
That brat! He's roaming around the scene of the crime again.

105
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,560
Hey!

106
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,260
Darn it.

107
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,960
Where the heck is he?

108
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,560
I see! I got it!

109
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,760
Where is Inspector Yokomizo?

110
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,060
He just stepped out a while ago.

111
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,960
I see.

112
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,160
By the way, do you guys smoke?

113
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,560
No.

114
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,660
Oh, right.

115
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,760
I'd like to see the evidence once more,

116
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,560
so will you please lend me a glove?

117
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,860
Yes, sir. By all means.

118
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,560
This is the wallet and this is the cigarette.

119
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,660
The coat and the glove.

120
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,560
And this is the victim's lighter.

121
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,260
It's out of oil.

122
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,460
I've figured out the mystery.

123
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,560
All I have to do now is put Pops to sleep with this anesthetic gun.

124
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,860
Huh?

125
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,360
I can't use the gun.

126
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,660
I used it at the filming site a while ago.

127
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,060
Bummers! What now?

128
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,460
I can't use Sleeping Kogoro.

129
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,460
I've got no choice but to drop a lot of hints at Pops.

130
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,260
Pops!

131
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,260
There are many things that I've noticed,

132
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,860
will you lend me an ear?

133
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,260
Maybe I can help solve the case.

134
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,060
I don't need anything like that anymore.

135
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,360
But...

136
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,360
Don't tell me that Pops already figured the case out?

137
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,060
Mr. Mouri, I looked all over for you.

138
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,560
Just where were you?

139
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,860
Well, I was going around this building looking for a key to this case.

140
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,060
And? Did you find the anything?

141
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,960
Did you solve the mystery of the vanished murder weapon?

142
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,460
Well, what I found was not the key,

143
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,960
but just this kid alone.

144
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,660
Just as I thought.

145
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,760
I see.

146
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,060
We'll continue to look for the murder weapon then.

147
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,260
So, if you come up with anything...

148
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,660
Okay, I'll let you know right away.

149
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,460
Yes, please do by all means.

150
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,060
If only I could use the anesthetic gun...

151
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,860
His facial expression changed.

152
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,360
It is as I thought, Pops...

153
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,360
He already figured out who the killer is.

154
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,160
Rurippe, I'd like to talk to you for a minute.

155
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,760
No, she's not the killer.

156
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,960
Darn it. I guess I've no choice,

157
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,960
but to hit Pops on the head with something

158
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,460
and make him pass out.

159
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,560
I wonder if there's something I kick.

160
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,660
They locked the door.

161
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,860
Hey.

162
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,660
I can't go inside if you lock the door.

163
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,060
Oh, my. What's up, Kogoro?

164
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,960
Why lock the door?

165
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,060
Don't tell me that you're going to seduce me?

166
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,160
Darn it. I can't hear what they're saying inside.

167
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
The most I can do is get this wiretap inside

168
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,860
from the space beneath the door.

169
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:18,760
Or are you suspecting that I killed Mr. Kazami,

170
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,960
and going to try to persuade me untill I admit I committed the crime?

171
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,260
Yes, exactly.

172
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,460
I want you to confess on your own initiative.

173
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,260
Just as I thought.

174
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,060
Pops's got it all wrong.

175
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,760
I have to stop him quickly.

176
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,980
I want you to confess on your own initiative.

177
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,580
Just as I thought.

178
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,380
Pops's got it all wrong.

179
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,880
I have to stop him quickly.

180
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,480
But you're not the one who's making the confession.

181
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,280
The one you're protecting,

182
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,180
Mr. Akira Nagumo.

183
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,580
Huh?

184
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,980
Just what are you talking about, Kogoro?

185
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,180
Why would I have to protect Mr. Nagumo?

186
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,480
You saw, didn't you?

187
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,780
Just before seeing the snow fall outside the window.

188
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,480
What did I see?

189
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,080
Back then, the staff opened the door to the room near the window

190
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,380
and came out, right?

191
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,880
I'm sure you saw it from the reflection on the glass door.

192
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,680
Mr. Naburo was coming out from the room next door

193
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,580
where Mr. Kazami was taking a nap.

194
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,080
You saw the staff about to come out of the room,

195
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,980
as well as the figure of the killer who rushed back into the room.

196
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:46,780
You saw how he acted and sensed that he did something,

197
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,180
so you invited everybody to go look at the snow outside

198
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,880
and tried to get everybody away from the room.

199
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,780
I realized just a while ago that's what happened

200
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:02,880
when I found Conan by the doorway of the crime scene.

201
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,580
Just before I turned the corner.

202
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,380
Just as would be expected of a renown detective,

203
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,880
was I'd like to say,

204
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,080
but you haven't found the murder weapon yet, have you?

205
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,080
The knife that slashed Mr. Kazami who was taking a nap.

206
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,780
Isn't it more important to figure out the mystery

207
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,080
of the missing knife that has a blade about 10 centimeters

208
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,780
before you go around making assumptions

209
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,780
about me having witnessed the killer?

210
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,180
Yes.

211
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,580
We were all too concerned about the blade being 10 centimeters long.

212
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,780
Because it's hard to believe that the blade is a small clump of steel,

213
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,180
no more than two centimeters.

214
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,280
Huh?

215
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,580
A cutter knife.

216
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,380
After the killer killed Mr. Kazami,

217
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:56,180
the blade was folded compactly away

218
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,980
and hidden inside this lighter that Mr. Kazami had.

219
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,780
Pops got it right!

220
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,780
But, Kogoro,

221
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:11,380
even if a blood smeared blade were to be inside that lighter,

222
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,980
it makes no difference that the murder weapon

223
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,780
hasn't been found yet, does it?

224
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,080
A blade of 10 centimeters means

225
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,980
that the knife sunk that deeply into him, doesn't it?

226
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,180
Unless the blade is firmly attached to the grip,

227
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,380
it's impossible to poke that deeply into something.

228
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,580
And I'm sure that blood would've splattered on the grip too, right?

229
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,780
If that's the case,

230
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:36,380
they should've found a box cutter grip that reacted to the luminol.

231
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,280
Okay. Pops, slash back at her.

232
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
I guess so.

233
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,680
See?

234
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,580
Hey...

235
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,680
First of all, you're going to have to look for the box cutter grip.

236
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,380
-Oh, no. -Hey, Conan.

237
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,580
Just what are you doing here?

238
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,980
Well...

239
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,280
Oh, right.

240
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,480
Ran, do you have something sticky like gum?

241
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,580
Huh?

242
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,380
Sticky like gum?

243
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,880
I have some gum

244
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,580
that Dad wanted me to bring along to keep him from getting sleepy.

245
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,880
I see!

246
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,880
Masking tape!

247
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,480
If you wrap the box cutter grip from the end of the blade

248
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,880
connected to the handle with masking tape,

249
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,380
then blood won't splatter onto the grip.

250
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,980
After committing the murder, the masking tape was removed.

251
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,380
And the tape was probably pasted onto the floor of the filming site.

252
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:30,280
There were masking tape pasted all over the floor as indicators there,

253
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,180
so it would be very inconspicuous, too.

254
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,480
But...

255
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,780
But why would Mr. Nagumo do something like that?

256
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,780
Even I, the first one to find the body could've rigged the trick, too!

257
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,580
I could've used snow to move everyone away,

258
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,480
and committed the murder myself!

259
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,380
Don't be ridiculous! You could never kill somebody.

260
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,880
Darn it. She sure is a tough one.

261
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,480
Sorry, Conan. It seems that I left the gum in the car.

262
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,480
Ran.

263
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,880
How do you wear brassieres?

264
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,980
I never used them, so I don't know how to use them!

265
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,380
Hey! Boys don't have to know how to use them.

266
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,280
I guess so.

267
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,780
Rurippe.

268
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,380
You could never have committed this crime.

269
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,080
Why not?

270
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,480
Then, tell me

271
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,480
how would you hide the blade of a cutter inside this lighter?

272
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,280
I just put it inside the lid and...

273
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,980
There's nothing inside the lid.

274
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,380
Then, your deduction must've been wrong, Kogoro.

275
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,080
Maybe you're wrong about Mr. Nagumo being the killer.

276
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,580
Rurippe.

277
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,580
For a lighter like this,

278
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:49,080
you add oil to the cotton that is in here.

279
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,180
First, you remove the bottom

280
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,280
and take out the cotton that is inside and make space.

281
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,980
Otherwise, you cannot hide the blade of the cutter.

282
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,780
Since I smoke, I realized when the lighter didn't light,

283
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,140
it means that the cotton must've been removed.

284
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,880
But since you don't like cigarettes and have never used a lighter,

285
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,900
you would never even think of hiding something in a place like this.

286
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,580
So, the only person that can think of something like this,

287
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,280
as well as someone that you would want to protect

288
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,580
is Mr. Akira Nagumo who used to be a heavy smoker in the past.

289
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,880
That's why I just said a while ago, didn't I?

290
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,680
Why would I have to protect Mr. Nagumo?

291
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,680
Well, it's true that I've met him sometimes at work,

292
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,580
but I'm not all that intimate with him.

293
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,880
I wonder about that.

294
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,780
He's your...

295
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,680
Lover, lover.

296
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,180
Because he's your real father.

297
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,080
Is that true?

298
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,780
Nothing that was used to commit the murder

299
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,880
seems to have been prepared ahead of time.

300
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,480
It was probably something that occurred on impulse.

301
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,880
As for the cotton with oil on it,

302
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,580
he probably pasted masking tape over it

303
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,380
and hid it somewhere on the floor of the filming site,

304
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,380
but it would probably be easily found if searched for.

305
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,080
Besides, after committing the murder,

306
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,880
it would be impossible to remove the cotton from the lighter

307
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,680
and putting the blades of the cutter into it with gloved hands,

308
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,880
with the risk of somebody walking in anytime.

309
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,880
So, I'm sure that we'll be able to find fingerprints somewhere.

310
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,080
So, before any evidence comes up,

311
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,080
persuade your father to turn himself in.

312
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,780
That's right, Kogoro.

313
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,780
Akira Nagumo is my real father.

314
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,980
I was born when my mother and he

315
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,080
used to be no-name actors at an acting school.

316
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,480
My mother found out she was pregnant

317
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,380
only after she split with my father

318
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,580
and started going out with my present father that you know, Kogoro.

319
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,080
It never even crossed my mind

320
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,880
until we acted in a film together

321
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,180
and he mentioned that I looked exactly like his lover in the past.

322
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,480
After I heard of the truth from my mother,

323
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,880
I went to complain to him because he called ask to see me.

324
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,180
I wasn't going to have him saying that he was my father.

325
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,280
Then, he broke down in tears before me.

326
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,380
So, I used to meet him now and then from that time.

327
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,080
A father is a father after all.

328
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,680
He killed Mr. Kazami for me.

329
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,180
If people found out that he's my real father,

330
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,580
my whole family would turn out a mess.

331
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,580
That's why, Kogoro...

332
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,080
I'd like you to keep this all inside you.

333
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,880
Because after all, we are childhood friends.

334
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,280
Please.

335
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,580
No way.

336
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,180
Being that you're the one asking me to do so,

337
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:11,480
the more I can't accept the deal.

338
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,480
I don't want you, my childhood friend to be bound

339
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,280
by such a painful and sad lie for the rest of your life.

340
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,480
Just as expected of you, Kogoro.

341
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,380
You haven't changed at all, your kind heart.

342
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,280
Shut up.

343
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,380
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

344
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,580
Because he was the one who called you

345
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,480
and told you that he was my real father from his side.

346
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,780
No.

347
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,880
Mr. Nagumo said nothing of that sort back then.

348
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,980
Huh?

349
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,080
Then, how did you know that we were father and daughter?

350
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,280
I figured it out from how he acted back then.

351
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,280
The hostility I felt from him back then was not of a man who was upset over another guy making passes at his lover,

352
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,380
but rather similar to what I felt when I went to introduce myself to Eri's father.

353
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,580
In other words, the feelings of a worried father.

354
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,580
Gosh. So, it's Eri after all.

355
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,280
I can never out beat her.

356
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,780
No, not her.

357
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,480
I remembered her stubborn father and...

358
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,680
Hey, do you know why I was studying so hard,

359
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,680
and wearing those thick lens glasses during junior high school?

360
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,780
It's because I wanted to attract someone's attention.

361
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,180
I was under the mistaken impression that you liked smart girls.

362
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,380
Huh?

363
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,280
Thirty minutes later,

364
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,480
through Ruri's persuasion,

365
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,780
Mr.Nagumo turned himself in.

366
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:41,480
The actual detective drama that occurred came to an end.

367
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,980
So, you've met Ruri.

368
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,480
She was more beautiful than she looks on TV, wasn't she?

369
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,380
Huh? Did you know that she is Ruri Ujo, the actress?

370
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,880
Yes, of course.

371
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,080
Because unlike him, I attend the class reunions.

372
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,980
Right, I heard a lot about you two from Ms. Ujo.

373
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,380
About Dad and you getting into a big fight over shoyu or sauce.

374
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,880
He got me angry

375
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,180
because he used to always pour sauce over his sunny side up too,

376
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,280
but just because he was embarrassed to say the same thing as I did,

377
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,780
he insisted that he wanted shoyu!

378
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,180
Oh, I see.

379
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,080
Come to think of it, Dad always pours sauce over his sunny side up.

380
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,880
He's just that dense of a person.

381
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,080
Then, why'd you marry him?

382
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,180
It's been so long ago that I've already forgotten.

383
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,680
Which gloves do you think are better?

384
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,280
Let's see... I like the black.

385
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,680
Oh, my. I prefer this gray one.

386
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,980
Really?

387
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,880
Because it's the gray color of a mouse.

388
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,980
Doesn't it make you feel warm?

389
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,380
Huh?

390
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:31,680
Because the gray tablecloth seemed to be warmer than the black coat.

391
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,680
Oh, did I say something funny?

392
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,880
No, you didn't.

393
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,280
Hey, what's going on? What a weird kid.

394
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,580
"Mouri Detective Agency"

395
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,080
What a strange old man.

396
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,060
Next Conan's Hint:

397
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,360
"Shogi, Chess, and Igo"
