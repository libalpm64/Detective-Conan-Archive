1
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:04,979
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04,979 --> 00:00:06,879
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,679
Good old country house.

4
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:10,579
Attracting the tourists and attracting a crime or two.

5
00:00:10,579 --> 00:00:12,079
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,979
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:16,079
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:21,464
This is really a charming place.

9
00:02:21,464 --> 00:02:24,164
There's something that feels familiar about this place!

10
00:02:24,164 --> 00:02:27,364
"Nostal sick", as they say.

11
00:02:29,664 --> 00:02:31,464
That's not it, Genta.

12
00:02:31,464 --> 00:02:34,064
You mean nostalgic.

13
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:35,764
Since when did they change it?

14
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:39,664
Just how old do you think you are, anyway?

15
00:02:39,664 --> 00:02:43,464
It certainly looks like a place that is talked of a lot

16
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:46,364
since it's going to be selected as a World Heritage.

17
00:02:46,364 --> 00:02:49,264
Recently there's talk about something else

18
00:02:49,264 --> 00:02:52,264
that is attracting people to come and see this place.

19
00:02:52,264 --> 00:02:53,764
What is that, Conan?

20
00:02:53,764 --> 00:02:56,764
What is it?

21
00:02:56,764 --> 00:02:57,964
That is...

22
00:02:57,964 --> 00:03:00,664
-The ghost story! -The ghost story.

23
00:03:02,964 --> 00:03:05,664
Oh, you meanies, all of you.

24
00:03:07,464 --> 00:03:10,264
Are there talks about a ghost?

25
00:03:10,264 --> 00:03:11,964
From about half a year ago,

26
00:03:11,964 --> 00:03:15,264
people started saying they witnessed a child ghost,

27
00:03:15,264 --> 00:03:17,564
and the rumor seems to have spread.

28
00:03:19,164 --> 00:03:20,164
Geez.

29
00:03:20,164 --> 00:03:24,564
Don't you guys know this tour is a gift for solving a case?

30
00:03:24,564 --> 00:03:27,964
Why don't you try to get a taste of good old Japan?

31
00:03:27,964 --> 00:03:30,464
Indeed. For god's sake.

32
00:03:30,464 --> 00:03:32,364
I'll try to get a taste of good old beer.

33
00:03:33,764 --> 00:03:35,364
Come on in, sir!

34
00:03:36,764 --> 00:03:38,164
That's him all right.

35
00:03:39,264 --> 00:03:45,164
"Love, Ghosts and World Heritage (Part 1)"

36
00:03:46,664 --> 00:03:50,464
This place really makes me feel as if we've time warped.

37
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:54,364
So, this is where we will stay for the night?

38
00:03:54,364 --> 00:03:57,564
This place is a world heritage and inn for tourists.

39
00:03:57,564 --> 00:04:00,564
This is really good old Japan.

40
00:04:00,564 --> 00:04:03,564
There are three floors inside,

41
00:04:03,564 --> 00:04:06,464
so it has more rooms than it looks like it has when seen from outside.

42
00:04:06,464 --> 00:04:09,564
There must have been a large family living here.

43
00:04:09,564 --> 00:04:11,764
Huh? That is...

44
00:04:11,764 --> 00:04:13,764
What is it, Conan?

45
00:04:13,764 --> 00:04:18,064
Well, the stone and the soil around the stone are new.

46
00:04:18,064 --> 00:04:21,564
For a hundred year old house of heritage, it's strange...

47
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:26,064
They are going to stay with us.

48
00:04:26,064 --> 00:04:28,064
Hello!

49
00:04:28,064 --> 00:04:29,564
-Hello, nice meeting you. -Hello, nice meeting you.

50
00:04:29,564 --> 00:04:32,164
Oh, the inn with the high rooftop.

51
00:04:32,164 --> 00:04:33,564
Rumiko is very impressed!

52
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,064
So is Kanako!

53
00:04:35,064 --> 00:04:37,864
What an old stinking place!

54
00:04:37,864 --> 00:04:40,164
Can I take a hot bath?

55
00:04:40,164 --> 00:04:42,064
"Kensaku Kawaji (37)" -How about air conditioning?

56
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:45,164
I guess you can't expect these things.

57
00:04:45,164 --> 00:04:47,064
He's awful.

58
00:04:47,064 --> 00:04:48,964
Rumiko, he'll hear you!

59
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:52,664
Did you say something, sisters?

60
00:04:52,664 --> 00:04:55,364
You stop it! Don't be childish.

61
00:04:55,364 --> 00:04:57,164
You're embarrassing them.

62
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,664
What did you say?

63
00:04:59,664 --> 00:05:01,564
I'm embarrassing you?

64
00:05:01,564 --> 00:05:03,464
You said so, didn't you?

65
00:05:03,464 --> 00:05:06,364
Stop it. How unsightly of you.

66
00:05:06,364 --> 00:05:09,064
Did you tell me to stop?

67
00:05:09,064 --> 00:05:10,564
Who are you, dirty old man?

68
00:05:10,564 --> 00:05:12,064
If you want to address me at all,

69
00:05:12,064 --> 00:05:13,364
you can call me,

70
00:05:13,364 --> 00:05:15,264
Kogoro Mouri.

71
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:16,764
Mouri?

72
00:05:16,764 --> 00:05:18,464
He means that...

73
00:05:18,464 --> 00:05:21,164
The famous detective, Sleeping Kogoro?

74
00:05:21,164 --> 00:05:24,864
They call me by that name, in spite of myself.

75
00:05:24,864 --> 00:05:27,864
Did you hear that? "In spite of myself"! So theatrical

76
00:05:27,864 --> 00:05:29,264
No, I didn't.

77
00:05:29,264 --> 00:05:31,864
Awesome! Rumiko is so impressed!

78
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,564
So you're a famous person, pops!

79
00:05:33,564 --> 00:05:35,564
Stop it, ladies.

80
00:05:35,564 --> 00:05:39,664
You are making my beer spill over.

81
00:05:39,664 --> 00:05:42,864
"Shokichi Sakaki (52)" -My name is Shokichi Sakaki.

82
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:45,364
I'm honored to meet you, Mr. Mouri.

83
00:05:45,364 --> 00:05:48,064
"Kazuaki Kuwashima (44)" -I'm Kazuaki Kuwashima.

84
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:49,264
Glad to meet you, sir.

85
00:05:49,264 --> 00:05:52,564
And I am glad to meet you, gentlemen.

86
00:05:52,564 --> 00:05:54,564
What a bore!

87
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:57,164
Excuse me, sir.

88
00:05:57,164 --> 00:05:59,064
What?

89
00:05:59,064 --> 00:06:01,164
"Iwao Nagakura (50), Kimiko Nagakura (45)" -Your inn is located

90
00:06:01,164 --> 00:06:04,364
a block down, at Ishioka house.

91
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,864
Why didn't you tell them sooner?

92
00:06:17,264 --> 00:06:19,664
How delicious! This pot of soup!

93
00:06:19,664 --> 00:06:21,564
This iwana fish is so delicious too.

94
00:06:21,564 --> 00:06:23,664
Delicious...

95
00:06:23,664 --> 00:06:25,764
The aroma of this miso soup is so fine.

96
00:06:25,764 --> 00:06:28,164
Yes. It warms your body.

97
00:06:28,164 --> 00:06:31,164
Well, this hot sake is the best for winter.

98
00:06:31,164 --> 00:06:32,464
Take one, please.

99
00:06:32,464 --> 00:06:35,164
Thank you, sir. I will.

100
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:37,464
Lay off!

101
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:41,564
They made it up and put it on the magazine.

102
00:06:41,564 --> 00:06:43,764
It's not real and you won't see it here.

103
00:06:46,164 --> 00:06:47,764
Dear!

104
00:06:47,764 --> 00:06:49,864
Don't you be rude to our guests.

105
00:06:49,864 --> 00:06:51,464
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:51,464 --> 00:06:53,364
We're facing a few problems recently...

107
00:06:53,364 --> 00:06:57,064
What was that all about?

108
00:06:57,064 --> 00:06:59,564
It's this, Ran. This article.

109
00:06:59,564 --> 00:07:02,664
What about it?

110
00:07:02,664 --> 00:07:05,864
"Ghost seen at the World Heritage site"?

111
00:07:05,864 --> 00:07:09,064
Unexpected busy business bewilders people of the district.

112
00:07:09,064 --> 00:07:11,364
"Unexpected selling point"?

113
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,464
We don't need any ghosts here.

114
00:07:13,464 --> 00:07:15,664
What a nuisance!

115
00:07:15,664 --> 00:07:16,664
I see.

116
00:07:16,664 --> 00:07:17,964
It should be.

117
00:07:17,964 --> 00:07:20,764
A world heritage is the pride of the world.

118
00:07:20,764 --> 00:07:24,064
So much so that it is an asset to all mankind.

119
00:07:24,064 --> 00:07:27,264
It must have been a fuss for you.

120
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:31,564
How dare they use it to attract curious people here

121
00:07:31,564 --> 00:07:33,164
as if this were another tourist attraction

122
00:07:33,164 --> 00:07:34,264
Here.

123
00:07:34,264 --> 00:07:35,764
It must be tough.

124
00:07:35,764 --> 00:07:37,264
Now this is for you.

125
00:07:37,264 --> 00:07:40,864
I'm just doing my share to welcome you...

126
00:07:40,864 --> 00:07:43,164
That's Mr. Mouri!

127
00:07:43,164 --> 00:07:45,064
Your words are precious to us.

128
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,164
Now you can drink to that.

129
00:07:46,164 --> 00:07:48,664
Well, thanks to you, I will.

130
00:07:48,664 --> 00:07:50,764
You're the one to enjoy drinking.

131
00:07:50,764 --> 00:07:53,964
Off you go with more drinks.

132
00:07:53,964 --> 00:07:56,964
Hey. Now they have started...

133
00:07:56,964 --> 00:07:58,964
Well, we are leaving now...

134
00:07:58,964 --> 00:08:00,864
Thanks for everything!

135
00:08:00,864 --> 00:08:02,664
-Good night. -Good night.

136
00:08:02,664 --> 00:08:04,664
You've done your share, guys.

137
00:08:04,664 --> 00:08:07,464
Now let's drink up once more.

138
00:08:07,464 --> 00:08:09,264
It's so delicious!

139
00:08:09,264 --> 00:08:12,064
-Conan, we should be going now. -Okay.

140
00:08:12,064 --> 00:08:13,964
What are we going to do? Sleep?

141
00:08:13,964 --> 00:08:15,564
No way.

142
00:08:15,564 --> 00:08:18,564
How can we go to sleep before making sure

143
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:19,964
if the ghost is real or not?

144
00:08:19,964 --> 00:08:20,964
Of course.

145
00:08:20,964 --> 00:08:25,464
Sure. We are here to search for facts!

146
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:26,964
Aren't we, Conan?

147
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,664
Me?

148
00:08:28,664 --> 00:08:30,864
It suits you, Conan. Go with them.

149
00:08:30,864 --> 00:08:32,564
I'll pass.

150
00:08:32,564 --> 00:08:34,364
I'm staying here and going to read a book in the room.

151
00:08:34,364 --> 00:08:35,664
Haibara!

152
00:08:42,964 --> 00:08:44,564
What's the matter with you, Conan?

153
00:08:44,564 --> 00:08:46,664
It's nothing.

154
00:08:46,664 --> 00:08:49,364
By the way, we'll go take a walk for a while.

155
00:08:49,364 --> 00:08:51,164
At this time of the day?

156
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,664
It's not that late.

157
00:08:53,664 --> 00:08:57,264
Besides, I get to see the attraction over there.

158
00:09:02,164 --> 00:09:04,664
Beware of fire!

159
00:09:07,164 --> 00:09:09,764
Beware of fire!

160
00:09:10,964 --> 00:09:13,364
I'm scared but it's beautiful!

161
00:09:13,364 --> 00:09:16,064
It doesn't surprise me if it comes up in this setup.

162
00:09:16,064 --> 00:09:18,764
They do it every evening.

163
00:09:18,764 --> 00:09:22,164
Each house sends someone in turn for the night watch.

164
00:09:22,164 --> 00:09:25,764
Yes. Fire is the biggest enemy to a house with thatched roofs.

165
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:28,764
The best they can do is take precautions against fire for themselves.

166
00:09:28,764 --> 00:09:31,464
The whole village takes and shares responsibility...

167
00:09:31,464 --> 00:09:33,664
In a way, this is very reasonable.

168
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:34,964
All's well.

169
00:09:34,964 --> 00:09:37,564
Good job and thank you.

170
00:09:37,564 --> 00:09:40,164
Beware of fire!

171
00:09:45,264 --> 00:09:46,664
Who...

172
00:09:46,664 --> 00:09:48,064
Are you?

173
00:09:51,764 --> 00:09:54,364
Hey, who are you?

174
00:09:59,164 --> 00:10:01,964
Beware of fire!

175
00:10:01,964 --> 00:10:03,864
Where's Ayumi?

176
00:10:03,864 --> 00:10:05,864
She was with us a moment ago.

177
00:10:05,864 --> 00:10:07,164
Ayumi!

178
00:10:07,164 --> 00:10:08,964
How did she get lost?

179
00:10:08,964 --> 00:10:10,264
Ayumi!

180
00:10:10,264 --> 00:10:13,664
-Ayumi! -Ayumi!

181
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:16,864
I'm sure she was with us here.

182
00:10:16,864 --> 00:10:20,164
I say she got hungry and went back to the inn alone.

183
00:10:20,164 --> 00:10:22,664
Well, she is not like you, Genta.

184
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,364
Are you sure?

185
00:10:24,364 --> 00:10:26,164
-What's that? -What?

186
00:10:26,164 --> 00:10:27,264
Did you find her?

187
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,564
It's Ayumi's scarf.

188
00:10:34,564 --> 00:10:36,164
I'm sure it is.

189
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,064
Wait.

190
00:10:50,064 --> 00:10:51,364
What's your name?

191
00:10:51,364 --> 00:10:53,264
Who are you?

192
00:10:53,264 --> 00:10:55,164
Wait, don't leave me behind!

193
00:10:56,464 --> 00:10:58,264
Wait!

194
00:10:58,264 --> 00:11:00,464
Oh? Ayumi's lost?

195
00:11:00,464 --> 00:11:03,064
I'm sorry. I guess we weren't careful enough.

196
00:11:03,064 --> 00:11:07,364
We decided we should come back and search for her with more people.

197
00:11:07,364 --> 00:11:10,264
I see. Let's all go look for her together.

198
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:12,664
Dad!

199
00:11:17,364 --> 00:11:18,564
Gosh!

200
00:11:18,564 --> 00:11:20,364
Come on, dad.

201
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,264
My husband too.

202
00:11:23,264 --> 00:11:25,964
He never stops drinking once he starts drinking.

203
00:11:25,964 --> 00:11:28,764
Let me call the villagers to help with the search.

204
00:11:28,764 --> 00:11:31,364
-Sorry for the inconvenience. -Thank you.

205
00:11:31,364 --> 00:11:32,664
I'll help you too.

206
00:11:32,664 --> 00:11:33,764
Yeah.

207
00:11:34,964 --> 00:11:36,564
Hey! What's the matter?

208
00:11:36,564 --> 00:11:38,064
Is something wrong?

209
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,464
I'm gonna help you.

210
00:11:39,464 --> 00:11:40,864
You can't and don't.

211
00:11:40,864 --> 00:11:41,964
What's the matter with you?

212
00:11:41,964 --> 00:11:44,064
I'm not trying to sell anything to you.

213
00:11:47,964 --> 00:11:49,564
Ayumi!

214
00:11:49,564 --> 00:11:52,864
-Ayumi! -Ayumi...

215
00:12:01,864 --> 00:12:03,764
We've found her!

216
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,064
She's at the root of a Japanese cedar tree at Water God Shrine!

217
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,264
Ayumi!

218
00:12:13,464 --> 00:12:15,564
Come on, Ayumi!

219
00:12:15,564 --> 00:12:16,864
Ayumi!

220
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:39,209
What? Conan?

221
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:40,309
Ayumi!

222
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:42,109
Are you all right?

223
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:44,309
Oh, everybody.

224
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:46,509
Do you feel any pain?

225
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:49,109
You appear to be free from injuries but...

226
00:12:49,109 --> 00:12:51,609
I'm all right. No pain at all.

227
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:53,409
Can you talk for a while?

228
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:55,009
Yes.

229
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:57,309
What actually happened?

230
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,609
It's...

231
00:12:59,609 --> 00:13:01,609
Did you see a girl?

232
00:13:01,609 --> 00:13:02,709
I did.

233
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:05,909
She was about 10 years old, bobbed hair,

234
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:07,809
and wearing a red skirt,

235
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:09,109
Impossible!

236
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,509
It can't be.

237
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:18,209
Mr. Nagakura...

238
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:21,709
She came to see Eiji. Mami did come.

239
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:22,809
Mami?

240
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:25,009
That girl. Her name is Mami?

241
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:26,209
Yes.

242
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:30,009
Mami and Eiji had been friends since childhood.

243
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,909
Mami was a year younger

244
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:34,109
and they were very close friends.

245
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:43,909
Yes. I'm sure it's her.

246
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:48,509
Mami believes that Eiji is not guilty and comes to see him.

247
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:49,709
Not guilty?

248
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:51,909
Cut it out!

249
00:13:51,909 --> 00:13:53,609
Young lady,

250
00:13:53,609 --> 00:13:55,609
you've mistaken something else for her,

251
00:13:55,609 --> 00:13:57,209
I'm sure of it.

252
00:13:57,209 --> 00:13:58,709
What?

253
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:00,509
But how do you know?

254
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:02,509
I'm sure I saw her.

255
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,509
Do you doubt her, pops?

256
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:07,809
Ayumi is an honest girl. She doesn't tell lies.

257
00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:09,309
Calm down, everybody!

258
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:14,009
Well, why are you certain that she saw wrong, Mr. Nagakura?

259
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:15,609
It's obvious!

260
00:14:15,609 --> 00:14:16,909
Because both of them...

261
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:18,209
Eiji since last month,

262
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:19,709
and that girl since ten years ago,

263
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:21,309
have been dead.

264
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:23,209
What?

265
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:25,409
Died ten years ago?

266
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:26,509
Then she was...

267
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:27,909
A ghost...

268
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:35,409
I can't stand that kind of a story.

269
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:37,209
-So it's true after all. -So they appeared.

270
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,909
I'm scared...

271
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:41,209
Don't you worry, Keiko.

272
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:44,609
What's the fuss all about?

273
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:47,109
Where have you been all this time, dad?

274
00:14:47,109 --> 00:14:48,709
What?

275
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:50,009
All of you...

276
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:51,709
Who's behind all this?

277
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:52,709
Dear...

278
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:53,709
What?

279
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:56,009
I got it. They are behind all this!

280
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:57,709
They?

281
00:14:57,709 --> 00:14:59,609
You can't fool me with such a trick!

282
00:14:59,609 --> 00:15:02,809
You won't have your way with me, never!

283
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:05,509
And Eiji.

284
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:07,409
That fellow is not my son!

285
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:09,009
Keep that in mind!

286
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:11,709
How can you say that! How cruel, Eiji just...

287
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:13,609
You hold your tongue!

288
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:15,709
Calm down, Mr. Nagakura.

289
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:17,509
The sake took hold of you.

290
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:18,709
That's right.

291
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:22,609
Cool down and have more hot sake, and you'll be...

292
00:15:22,609 --> 00:15:24,309
Leave me alone!

293
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:36,009
I smell something.

294
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:37,809
This village has something other than a ghost.

295
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:38,809
Yeah.

296
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:41,209
It seems worth investigating.

297
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:43,109
Right.

298
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,709
Was that a ghost?

299
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:47,109
That Mami...

300
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:09,409
"Otozawa" -The house of Otozawa.

301
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:11,909
This is where Mami had been living

302
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:14,109
with her parents until 10 years ago.

303
00:16:14,109 --> 00:16:16,809
She was the only child in the family.

304
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,909
Hey, Ayumi!

305
00:16:27,609 --> 00:16:31,309
Mami died of a disease.

306
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:36,509
And then the parents moved out to some other place.

307
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:39,109
Are there any photos left?

308
00:16:39,109 --> 00:16:41,609
Maybe not, it's been 10 years now.

309
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:44,309
We can tell if what Yoshida saw was real or not

310
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:46,509
with a photo of her.

311
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:48,509
That's right!

312
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:50,609
How well your mind works, Haibara.

313
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:54,509
Real? You mean the ghost?

314
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:57,409
Hey, you of all people start talking like that...

315
00:16:57,409 --> 00:17:00,609
Don't you believe her, Conan?

316
00:17:00,609 --> 00:17:02,009
Don't you know

317
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:05,609
I'm the detective who is making his way with logic and reasoning?

318
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,009
There is no place for a ghost in...

319
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:08,909
We're not asking anything of the sort.

320
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:10,009
What?

321
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:15,309
They're both asking you if you believe in Yoshida.

322
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:16,909
No. I...

323
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:22,709
Ayumi!

324
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,109
You'll pay for this, Conan!

325
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:27,409
Geez.

326
00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:29,609
And now we go for Eiji.

327
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:31,109
What? Oh, yeah.

328
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:44,209
Suicide?

329
00:17:44,209 --> 00:17:46,009
Eiji Nagakura killed himself?

330
00:17:46,009 --> 00:17:48,109
Yes. There is no doubt about it.

331
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,309
Since you asked me,

332
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:53,009
I checked on Eiji Nagakura in the crime articles in the newspaper

333
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:55,609
and I found one.

334
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:59,509
It took place half a year ago

335
00:17:59,509 --> 00:18:01,309
in the town of Shoujin.

336
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:05,509
It's right next to this village you are staying in.

337
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:07,209
They found his fingerprints at the scene.

338
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:10,909
He was wanted and he probably gave up on running.

339
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:15,909
Eiji Nagakura is a jewelry robber who committed suicide.

340
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:20,009
But his mother believes him to be innocent.

341
00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:24,209
That's why the villagers were reluctant to talk.

342
00:18:24,209 --> 00:18:25,609
Conan.

343
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:29,709
I didn't tell a lie.

344
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:33,109
I really saw her, Mami.

345
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:37,909
I want you to believe me, Conan.

346
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:40,809
So I want you to...

347
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:42,509
You want him to investigate, don't you?

348
00:18:42,509 --> 00:18:44,109
Yes.

349
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:48,509
Of course he will do it for you and just for you.

350
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:51,209
Haibara, are you serious?

351
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:53,509
Edogawa?

352
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:54,509
Sure.

353
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,509
This is one place that's eerie even in the daytime.

354
00:18:58,509 --> 00:19:01,109
I saw her over there

355
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:02,209
and as if she wanted me to follow her,

356
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:04,909
we came to this Water God Shrine.

357
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:06,109
Then...

358
00:19:06,109 --> 00:19:07,709
Then?

359
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:11,509
What happened then, Ayumi?

360
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:13,109
She disappeared.

361
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:14,309
Disappeared?

362
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:17,609
Yes. She just disappeared into darkness.

363
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:20,909
And she never appeared again.

364
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:24,809
I got tired of calling her

365
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:27,709
and it seemed I went to sleep at the foot of the tree.

366
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:31,109
Where did she disappear?

367
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:32,309
Exactly where?

368
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:36,109
The mist was thick...

369
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:39,109
It was there beside the Water God Shrine.

370
00:19:49,109 --> 00:19:51,309
It's still new.

371
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:54,809
It says "Tamai". It could be the inn across the street.

372
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:57,309
Oh. That's the story.

373
00:19:57,309 --> 00:20:00,309
This kimono was blown away by the wind.

374
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:02,409
Ayumi saw it and thought it was the girl by mistake.

375
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,909
What are you talking about, Genta?

376
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:08,809
Clothes hung out to dry won't come flying this far.

377
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:10,709
It's not a mistake.

378
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,909
I actually saw her.

379
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:16,409
I believe you, Ayumi.

380
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:20,209
It must be some coincidence.

381
00:20:20,209 --> 00:20:23,409
Hey. Are you insisting...

382
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:26,709
I saw him yesterday...

383
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:28,609
What is he doing?

384
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:38,209
Beware of fire.

385
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:42,609
Beware of fire.

386
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:50,709
Footsteps?

387
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:52,609
It's walking!

388
00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:53,909
So it really is a ghost after all!

389
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:57,209
But a ghost doesn't walk on foot, Genta.

390
00:20:57,209 --> 00:20:58,609
You're right!

391
00:20:58,609 --> 00:21:00,309
Then, it means...

392
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:02,009
You two stay here!

393
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:07,009
We'll go with you.

394
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:08,809
Then, keep quiet.

395
00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:14,009
It's you.

396
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:16,209
All's well on this floor.

397
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:17,709
It's on the top floor.

398
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:27,909
Darn it!

399
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:35,409
Who is it?

400
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:36,909
You!

401
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:38,509
What were you doing?

402
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:47,609
Mr. Nagakura!

403
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:51,809
-Call an ambulance. -And the police!

404
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:54,209
-Yes, I will. -Yes, will do.

405
00:21:54,209 --> 00:21:56,909
The culprit is not far yet.

406
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:01,309
Ran!

407
00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:03,909
Oh, there...

408
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:06,809
Mami! So she was real after all.

409
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:08,109
Where are you going?

410
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:30,209
It can't be...

411
00:22:30,209 --> 00:22:33,109
A ghost attacked Mr. Nagakura?

412
00:24:32,936 --> 00:24:34,736
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:34,736 --> 00:24:36,036
"Loupe"

414
00:24:36,036 --> 00:24:37,036
The next episode is the solution.

415
00:24:37,036 --> 00:24:38,236
Well, who is he?

416
00:24:38,236 --> 00:24:39,336
Is he the big man?

417
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:40,736
The big man?
