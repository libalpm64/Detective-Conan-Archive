1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,640
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,540
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,340
Today Yoko's appearing. Long time no see.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,340
Even TV idols have a lot of worries.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,140
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,750
"Mouri Detective Agency"

9
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,950
"Mouri Detective Agency" -L-O-V-E

10
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,850
I love Yoko!

11
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,350
Cutie Yoko!

12
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,250
-Oh, boy, don't you get tired of watching the same video -Yoko!

13
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,950
-over and over again during the day? -Yoko!

14
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,650
-That's enough! -Yoko!

15
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,450
Why not? I have so little work to do anyway.

16
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,250
But you have a lot of mail.

17
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,450
It may be a job offer.

18
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,850
I will look through them later,

19
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,750
so just leave them somewhere around, okay?

20
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,250
You don't have any work to do, and neither are you motivated.

21
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,250
Let's see, the electricity bill

22
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,550
and an invitation to give a lecture.

23
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,750
Oh, my...

24
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,050
This letter is from Yoko.

25
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,050
What?

26
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,650
It's an invitation to a party.

27
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,950
Great.

28
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,150
An engagement party will be held at her friend's house.

29
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,150
Engagement?

30
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,750
It's her friend who got engaged

31
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,850
and asked her to arrange to meet the renowned Detective Mr. Mouri.

32
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,350
You're going to the party, aren't you? Father?

33
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:17,750
Engagement...

34
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,250
He's in a world of his own.

35
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:27,750
"The Secrets of Pop Stars (Part 1)"

36
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,850
Well, thank you, Yoko.

37
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,950
It is a great pleasure to be invited

38
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,350
to the engagement party of your best friend.

39
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,350
The pleasure is mine.

40
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:42,550
"Yoko Okino (22), Idol" -I'm sorry for inviting you on such short notice.

41
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,850
You must be surprised.

42
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,150
No. Not at all.

43
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,750
You're, right.

44
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,750
You were the one who was sadly mistaken and terribly disappointed.

45
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:55,250
So? Who is she? Your engaged friend?

46
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,850
You will see her soon.

47
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,850
All of you know her very well.

48
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,050
Do I know the person well?

49
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,250
Hi, Yoko.

50
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,750
Oh, dear...

51
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,150
You really brought him here.

52
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,050
The renowned Detective Kogoro Mouri.

53
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,250
If I'm not mistaken, you're...

54
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,950
the person playing the role of Detective Samonji.

55
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,650
Osamu Kenzaki.

56
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,950
"Osamu Kenzaki (26), Actor"

57
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,950
So, then, you're Yoko's engaged friend?

58
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,650
Well, actually, no... I am her future husband-to-be.

59
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:34,250
Yoko's best friend is my future bride.

60
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,750
Anyway, I think it's really great that you brought

61
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,050
the renowned Detective Mouri to us.

62
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,150
She'll sure be delighted to meet him.

63
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,150
In fact, she doesn't know that Mr. Mouri is here yet.

64
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,250
I wanted to surprise her.

65
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,250
Okay, let's go to see her surprised look.

66
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,050
There's no answer at all.

67
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,350
But, everyone should already be here by now.

68
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,350
The door's not locked.

69
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,250
I'm really sorry, Mr. Mouri.

70
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,550
You came all the way out here but I treated you so cruelly.

71
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,550
Don't worry about it.

72
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,150
Being struck by a famous actress like you

73
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,450
will be something special to look back on.

74
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,950
"Kaoru Kusano (20), Actress" -I'm recently being hassled by a stalker.

75
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,250
I saw a strange man looking through the peep hole of the door,

76
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,150
so I couldn't help striking at you.

77
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,250
If you are his admirer or fan, you should have known his face?

78
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,050
Well then, Yoko's friend who got engaged to Mr. Kenzaki is...

79
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,450
Yes, it is me.

80
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,050
The formal wedding ceremony will be this coming spring.

81
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,250
It's still off-the-records to the media.

82
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,950
That reminds me,

83
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:59,050
Kaoru co-starred with Mr. Kenzaki in "Detective Samonji".

84
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,950
That's right.

85
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,050
We brought them both here to celebrate and tease them,

86
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,250
while watching the TV program being aired tonight.

87
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,950
"Yuki Takeno (22), Multi-talented" -The perfect couple...

88
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,550
Yuki Takeno.

89
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,850
I think your nails are a little bit too flashy, Yuki.

90
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,450
These false nails are cool, isn't it?

91
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:25,250
But it's a pity, Yoko Okino.

92
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,550
Yuki Takeno and Kaoru Kusano...

93
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,050
One more person, and all four would be present.

94
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,550
How regrettable indeed.

95
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,650
Did someone call me?

96
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,450
Terumi.

97
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,750
Well, well, you have turned out quite nicely.

98
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,350
"Terumi Hoshino (23), Actress" -Well, Yoko told me that I had to come.

99
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,050
Am I interrupting? If so, I can leave.

100
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,150
Come, come.

101
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:55,850
Now the four "Earth Ladies" have gathered here again after a long recess.

102
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,650
Earth Ladies?

103
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,350
You may not know, but...

104
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,550
Kaoru Kusano means "Fragrant" and "Field of Grass"

105
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,150
which is represented for the fragrant field of sweet grass!

106
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,950
Yuki Takeno means "Snow" and "Mountain Area"

107
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,250
is for white snow covering the high mountain.

108
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,650
Terumi Hoshino means "Beautifully glittering" and "Stars"

109
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,950
is for the glittering stars in heaven.

110
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,150
Yoko Okino means "Ocean" and "Offshore"

111
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,350
is for the sparkling waves of the blue sea.

112
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,150
So, all four of them together are called "Earth Ladies".

113
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,550
That's figures.

114
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,850
Each of the names stands for a superb view of the earth.

115
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,350
Yeah, but Earth Ladies broke up

116
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,750
because of a quarrel between Terumi and Kaoru.

117
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,750
So, only Yoko continued on as a singer.

118
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,550
Anyway, I was surprised that Kaoru, the youngest of the four of us,

119
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,550
turned out to be the first to get married.

120
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,150
Actually, so did I.

121
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,750
I thought Terumi would be the first to get married and settle down.

122
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,250
Hey, I thought you once said something about your loved one?

123
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,850
Yes, yes, tell us what happened to your relationship with the guy?

124
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,150
Did you confess your love to him?

125
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,150
Not really.

126
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:03,250
Besides, like some people say, "Marriage is the tomb of love and trust."

127
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,750
So, it's much easier to love him from a distance.

128
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,150
That way I can keep him in my heart as my ideal man.

129
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,350
Hey, just what do you mean by that?

130
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,050
Terumi...

131
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,850
But who is that old man with the kid?

132
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:19,850
Oh, yeah...

133
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,150
Are you Kenzaki's brother or something?

134
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,050
I'm...

135
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:29,250
It's about time "Detective Samonji" will be starting.

136
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,850
"Atsushi Maguma (23), Kaoru's manager" -Don't you want to watch it?

137
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,450
I'll pass it up.

138
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,350
In the meantime, I'm going to take a bath.

139
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,950
Just tell me when it's over.

140
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,950
But... As the food's getting cold,

141
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,250
I'd like to have dinner together now.

142
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,650
Please don't bug me.

143
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,350
I said "Pass". Don't make me say the same thing over and over again.

144
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,650
When will a loser like you get off telling me what to do?

145
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,350
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,250
Wait. Kaoru.

147
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,450
She hasn't changed at all.

148
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,350
She's always embarrassed to watch the programs she stars on,

149
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,150
with other people.

150
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,850
Just as we planned.

151
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,250
Are you really going to do it?

152
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,550
Of course. That's why we invited you.

153
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,350
Do what?

154
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,750
We'll be waiting for you in the living room.

155
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,850
Yoko, why don't you go first,

156
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,450
and change into your costume in the restroom?

157
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,450
All right.

158
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,450
That's none other than

159
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,850
the costume that the "Earth Ladies" wore at the time they debuted.

160
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,850
I see. When Kaoru comes out of the bathroom...

161
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,250
Yes. Three of us are going to celebrate her engagement

162
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,850
by wearing these costumes and singing our debut song.

163
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,350
It's so embarrassing to wear this costume, though.

164
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,950
Great! It looks nice! Lovely Yoko!

165
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,950
You're just too much! You know that?

166
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,250
Thank you for waiting.

167
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,650
Do you really want to do it?

168
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:05,750
Well then, next I'll go get rejuvenated.

169
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,850
Hey, Yuki. Hurry up. I also have to change into.

170
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:09,850
See you later.

171
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,550
Hey, let's all write a few lines each

172
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,150
in celebration of Kaoru's engagement.

173
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,250
I wish you much love and happiness.

174
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,450
Here you go.

175
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,550
Okay then, next, Terumi.

176
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,850
Don't mind me, I think I'll pass.

177
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,250
It's a good opportunity to make peace with Kaoru.

178
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,650
I guess I have no choice, then.

179
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,550
Hey.

180
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:43,850
Did Kaoru really want to see Pops?

181
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:50,150
Yeah, as she said, weirdo follows her around.

182
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,550
She wants him to find out who the man is...

183
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,750
Once she moves in with me,

184
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,550
she won't be troubled by the man anymore?

185
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,950
Yeah.

186
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
That's a message card?

187
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,600
Yeah, we're all writing our comments on the card.

188
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,200
All right, then I'll go get transform myself.

189
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,200
Look. What is this?

190
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,500
"I express my condolences" -Oh, no.

191
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,100
"I express my condolences" and she stubs out her cigarette on it.

192
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,700
Just what Terumi would do.

193
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,000
If Terumi dares to do that, then I can do this...

194
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,500
With a loving kiss.

195
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,100
Hey! Manager, why don't you write something to her?

196
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,000
No, I...

197
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,000
Come on, you don't have to be modest.

198
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,900
Well, now, you can write anything, comments,

199
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,300
complaints, whatever you like.

200
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,300
Please.

201
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,500
"Congratulations"

202
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
I'm sorry,

203
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,000
you don't have to if you really don't want to.

204
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,500
No, I'm just glad.

205
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,800
Here, I changed clothes.

206
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,500
It fits you just right.

207
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,100
Then, I'll go call Kaoru.

208
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,100
What's wrong with him?

209
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,400
I have no idea.

210
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Hey! None of you watched my drama seriously,

211
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,600
so none of you really care.

212
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,100
Calm down.

213
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,400
It finished rewinding.

214
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,700
Okay, well just wait for Kaoru to come.

215
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,000
Where is she?

216
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,300
Well...

217
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,300
I tried calling her many times, but she didn't answer.

218
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,100
She may have become dizzy or fainted in the bathroom.

219
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,100
Then, Mr. Kenzaki, you should go check it out.

220
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,400
I think she's just sulky and locked herself in the bathroom.

221
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,700
Blood stains.

222
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,600
They lead to the front entrance.

223
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
Don't tell me that...

224
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,500
Kaoru! Now please come out from there.

225
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,800
Everyone is waiting for you.

226
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
Mr. Kenzaki, open the door.

227
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,000
Hurry!

228
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Kaoru! I'm coming in!

229
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Kaoru.

230
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Kaoru.

231
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Kaoru!

232
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,460
Kaoru.

233
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,760
What happened?

234
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,060
How did this all come about?

235
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,360
She still has a pulse.

236
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,360
We must get her to the hospital immediately. Her life depends on it.

237
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,860
Hurry!

238
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,160
What happened? I heard someone shouting something.

239
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,360
Kaoru?

240
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,060
Hey! Kaoru! Are you all right?

241
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,060
Kaoru!

242
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,360
-Ran, call the ambulance! -Yes.

243
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,860
The victim is Ms. Kaoru Kusano, 20 years old.

244
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,760
Room number 1 on the 28th floor.

245
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,460
A 20-year-old living alone in this luxury condo.

246
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,760
Some rich kid or something?

247
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,160
You don't know, Inspector?

248
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,660
The Earth Ladies?

249
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,360
Earth what? What's that?

250
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,360
Oh, yes.

251
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,560
We're the police.

252
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,060
Please.

253
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,460
We're coming.

254
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,760
I'm sorry.

255
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,460
I must have the wrong room.

256
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,760
Inspector Megure. We've been waiting for you.

257
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,860
There's a lots of TV celebrities.

258
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,760
I see. Now let me ask you one more time.

259
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,960
You three women were invited to Ms. Kusano's engagement party.

260
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,560
And while she was in the bathroom,

261
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,360
you, one by one, changed into your costumes in the rest room,

262
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,860
to surprise her.

263
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,760
Ms. Okino, Ms. Takeno and Ms. Hoshino in that order.

264
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,460
And when three of you finished changing,

265
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,060
the manager, Mr. Maguma went to the bathroom to call her

266
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,460
but there was no answer.

267
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,960
Next, her fiancee, Mr. Kenzaki went to call her

268
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,360
and opened the door of the bathroom.

269
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,160
You found Ms. Kusano lying on the ground

270
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,060
and bleeding from the neck, right?

271
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,460
Yes.

272
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,960
And once again, just like the devil had planned it,

273
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,460
at the scene of the crime, I run into...

274
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,360
Don't be like that.

275
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,460
I just happened to be invited here by Ms. Okino.

276
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,260
It's just a coincidence.

277
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,460
It is not a mere coincidence but a "meaningful" coincidence.

278
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,960
Or maybe better said, mere curse.

279
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,760
And? Where is the victim, Ms. Kusano now?

280
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,560
She's been transported to Haido Hospital by ambulance.

281
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,760
We haven't heard from Mr. Maguma,

282
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,360
who accompanied her to the hospital,

283
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,160
so, we don't know how she is now.

284
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,360
Kaoru, is she going to die?

285
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,360
There's no point in waiting,

286
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,060
I'll go call the hospital and ask about her condition.

287
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,160
I'll go with you.

288
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,360
My dad often goes to see the doctor at this hospital

289
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,660
because of his diabetes,

290
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,560
so I know the number.

291
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,560
Really? Great! Thanks.

292
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,460
And about the person who cut her neck.

293
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,260
Do you think that the killer is someone in this very room?

294
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,260
No way.

295
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,760
But there is possibility, right?

296
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,960
But, people often say that the first finder of the body

297
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,060
is the most suspicious.

298
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,060
Hey, Hey. I don't have any reason to kill Kaoru

299
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,260
and when I found her in the bathroom,

300
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,860
that kid with glasses was with me.

301
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,760
Besides, he's the one who told me

302
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,860
to open the door of the bath room to begin with.

303
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,160
Is that right?

304
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,060
Yeah! Because...

305
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,460
there was blood dripping from the hall into the entrance.

306
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,460
And when I opened the entrance door,

307
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,460
I found that stuff lying there.

308
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,660
A rain jacket, work gloves with holes

309
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,260
an eye dropper and a handkerchief.

310
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,060
We found them outside the front door,

311
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:30,160
so we laid them aside before the ambulance came.

312
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,460
The rain jacket and gloves are covered with blood.

313
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,860
This must be the clothes that the criminal was wearing.

314
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,960
It's slight, but there's a lipstick stain on the handkerchief.

315
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,860
If someone filled this bottle with anesthetic

316
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,560
and the culprit used the anesthetic soaked handkerchief

317
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,860
to put her to sleep before committing the murder.

318
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:57,760
But who did it to Kaoru? It's outrageous.

319
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,060
It's the stalker. He did to her.

320
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:05,360
The stalker scared her, playing spooky Ding-Dong Dash.

321
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,460
Ding-Dong?

322
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,060
It's a trick of ringing the front doorbell

323
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,760
and then running away.

324
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,560
But it's not just a joke, it's a crime.

325
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,960
A strange note was always left outside the front door.

326
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,860
It said, "I'll come again,"

327
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,460
"I'll come next time,"

328
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,460
and "I'll come even if I die."

329
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,060
It got worse and worse over time.

330
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:34,060
That creepy piece of paper typed with a word processor.

331
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:39,260
I see. That's why Ms. Kusano tried to hit me out of blue

332
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,060
when I rang the bell.

333
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,660
Was the door locked at the time of the murder?

334
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,960
It was open.

335
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,360
There were lots of people here

336
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,560
so she may have felt safe and left the door unlocked.

337
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,660
So, the stalker found the door left open,

338
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,360
went inside the room,

339
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,260
came across Ms. Kusano who had just come out after taking a bath.

340
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,860
Then, because Ms. Kusano saw the stalker's face,

341
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,560
the stalker put her to sleep with medicine

342
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,960
and slashed her throat with a weapon.

343
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,760
The bloody rain jacket and work gloves were disposed of

344
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,460
because they were too conspicuous and would attract negative attention,

345
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,560
then the killer fled.

346
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,960
Alright, Takagi.

347
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,660
Start poking around the condo, looking for clues.

348
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,660
The criminal wore a rain jacket on a day that wasn't raining.

349
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,360
There's got to be a witness.

350
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,360
Yes, sir.

351
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,360
But I don't think anyone saw that person

352
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,860
because the person's very cautious.

353
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,960
Very cautious?

354
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,660
Well, if you were wearing a bloody rain jacket,

355
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,060
you would step on the blood that drips from the jacket, right?

356
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,460
But when I saw it,

357
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:48,560
there were no traces of footprints at the bloody entrance.

358
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,060
This means that the criminal tried to avoid stepping on the blood

359
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,660
when running away.

360
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,360
That's right.

361
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,460
That's odd...

362
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:05,460
If the criminal saw many shoes in the entrance way,

363
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,560
why did that cautious person come into a room with so many people?

364
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,160
Inspector.

365
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,960
What if the criminal deliberately walked with the rain jacket in hand

366
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,160
to make the blood drip down on the hallway,

367
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,760
and then tossed them over outside,

368
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,460
in order to make it look like he or she ran outside?

369
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:27,560
Yes, and if Ms. Kusano was acquainted with the aggressor,

370
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,760
the person could call her without alerting her.

371
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,560
If she defenselessly comes out from the bathtub,

372
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,360
then it wouldn't be difficult to make her smell the medicine

373
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,360
and put her to sleep at the door.

374
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,060
Hey, wait!

375
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,260
You mean the murderer is...

376
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,960
Could be one of us.

377
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,260
Is that right?

378
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,360
Terumi.

379
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,660
That's true.

380
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,960
The restroom that was used as a changing room

381
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,860
is between the living room and the bathroom.

382
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,860
Each of us would have had a chance to commit the murder.

383
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,360
Even you...

384
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,460
Even so, Yoko couldn't have...

385
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,460
While she was changing, we were waiting in front of the restroom

386
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,260
and after that, we went back to the living room with Yoko.

387
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,260
Then I'm also clean.

388
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:22,060
When I found her, I was with this kid.

389
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,660
Yeah.

390
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,760
First, when Kaoru went to the bathroom,

391
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,660
you very kindly accompanied her. You couldn't have killed her.

392
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,560
You walked to the bathroom with her?

393
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,760
Yes.

394
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,260
So, you had the chance to attack her then?

395
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:44,160
Anyway, let me ask each of you.

396
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,960
But before that,

397
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,460
aren't you forgetting to do something?

398
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,160
The deadly weapon.

399
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,260
The knife that was used to cut Kaoru's throat.

400
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:59,660
If It's found in our belongings or indoors,

401
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,460
the criminal's among us.

402
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,760
I don't think a criminal from outside

403
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,960
would hide the weapon somewhere in this condo.

404
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,360
The criminal may have wiped the blood from the knife,

405
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,860
and the hemoglobin of the blood may be invisible to the naked eye.

406
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,460
But, luminol solution can detect

407
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,060
the small amount of hemoglobin in the blood.

408
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,460
It's not something you can hide after all, right?

409
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,360
You're right.

410
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,060
What?

411
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,760
What on earth is she?

412
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,940
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,260
"Work gloves with holes"

414
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,580
-Next. -Well, the victim, Kaoru Kusano.

415
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,960
Her fiancee, Kenzaki. Terumi knows too much...

416
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:42,170
I don't know.
