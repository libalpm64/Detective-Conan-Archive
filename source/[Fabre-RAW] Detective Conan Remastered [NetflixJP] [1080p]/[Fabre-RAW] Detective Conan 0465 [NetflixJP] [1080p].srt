1
00:00:01,482 --> 00:00:02,982
Throwing beans!

2
00:00:04,382 --> 00:00:06,382
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:06,382 --> 00:00:07,682
The Black Organization and a boy.

4
00:00:07,682 --> 00:00:09,082
A reunion that seems coincidental

5
00:00:09,082 --> 00:00:10,582
crosses with a stormy incident!

6
00:00:10,582 --> 00:00:11,882
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,882 --> 00:00:13,382
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,382 --> 00:00:15,482
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,428 --> 00:02:01,228
Eisuke Hondo tells Pops about a strange part-time job.

10
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:05,128
It's work involving collecting trash from the trash dump in Toriya Town

11
00:02:05,128 --> 00:02:07,928
and to exchange that trash on the following trash day.

12
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:11,828
We headed for the site just out of curiosity.

13
00:02:11,828 --> 00:02:15,428
However, when we get there, we encountered a homicide case.

14
00:02:15,428 --> 00:02:19,428
We met a boy who said he witnessed Rena Mizunashi's accident.

15
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:22,428
No doubt about it.

16
00:02:22,428 --> 00:02:23,928
Which means...

17
00:02:23,928 --> 00:02:27,228
Don't tell me this guy actually took us here because of the boy?

18
00:02:29,228 --> 00:02:31,828
Finally, it's getting interesting.

19
00:02:33,128 --> 00:02:38,928
"The Shadow of the Black Organization: Pearl Shooting Star"

20
00:02:39,728 --> 00:02:42,428
Well? What kind of accident was it?

21
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:43,628
Well, you see...

22
00:02:45,928 --> 00:02:48,128
The person riding the motorbike

23
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:50,528
suddenly came falling from the sky.

24
00:02:50,528 --> 00:02:54,428
And that person's helmet came off, so I looked at the face.

25
00:02:55,728 --> 00:02:58,028
You're talking about the Masked Yaiba program that was on the other day!

26
00:02:59,328 --> 00:03:00,828
Masked Yaiba?

27
00:03:00,828 --> 00:03:04,128
Yes. It's a scene from the Masked Yaiba program.

28
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:07,228
These guys were attacking him while he was riding his motorbike.

29
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:11,928
His mask comes off and Masked Yaiba's identity was about to be disclosed.

30
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,028
You're wrong!

31
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,028
No! I really...

32
00:03:17,028 --> 00:03:20,128
Huh? Have we met before?

33
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:21,628
Huh?

34
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:23,528
No, I don't think so.

35
00:03:23,528 --> 00:03:25,928
Then, what this boy is saying is...

36
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:27,228
Yeah.

37
00:03:27,228 --> 00:03:29,828
From the shock of losing his mother,

38
00:03:29,828 --> 00:03:34,328
he's probably confusing reality with something he saw in a movie or on TV.

39
00:03:34,328 --> 00:03:36,628
Besides, if they wanted to shut him up,

40
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:39,528
they would've killed him, too.

41
00:03:39,528 --> 00:03:42,628
The woman who died used to jog in the morning four times a week

42
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:45,228
after she went out to throw out the trash.

43
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:47,528
If they were going to shoot,

44
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:49,728
they would've done so.

45
00:03:53,128 --> 00:03:56,928
They wouldn't do something as dangerous as to take the risk

46
00:03:56,928 --> 00:03:59,928
of sneaking into the woman's room and wait for her to come home, right?

47
00:03:59,928 --> 00:04:01,128
True.

48
00:04:01,128 --> 00:04:03,028
Why don't we go to that room, then?

49
00:04:03,028 --> 00:04:04,628
-Huh? -Huh?

50
00:04:04,628 --> 00:04:07,628
You may come up with something, Pops.

51
00:04:11,728 --> 00:04:13,328
Inspector.

52
00:04:13,328 --> 00:04:14,628
What is it?

53
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:18,128
May I wait here?

54
00:04:18,128 --> 00:04:20,728
Yes, of course.

55
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:24,028
Has he been using the wheelchair for long?

56
00:04:24,028 --> 00:04:26,728
No, he's been using it from a month ago.

57
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:30,328
He went fishing with the people from his company

58
00:04:30,328 --> 00:04:33,428
and broke his leg after sliding in a rocky area.

59
00:04:33,428 --> 00:04:37,728
The doctor said that his cast will be removed in six months.

60
00:04:37,728 --> 00:04:40,828
Which means his room is on the first floor?

61
00:04:40,828 --> 00:04:44,328
No. It's upstairs on the second floor next to Mrs. Funemoto's room.

62
00:04:44,328 --> 00:04:46,328
When Mr. Funemoto goes upstairs,

63
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:48,928
I lend him my shoulder,

64
00:04:48,928 --> 00:04:51,328
then I bring his wheelchair up to him later.

65
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,028
This is Mrs. Funemoto's room.

66
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,028
This is the veranda

67
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:10,028
where Mrs. Funemoto was found shot in the head?

68
00:05:10,028 --> 00:05:13,128
But how did the culprit make it into this room?

69
00:05:14,428 --> 00:05:15,728
By the railing,

70
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:18,128
there is a rope with a hook attached to it.

71
00:05:18,128 --> 00:05:19,328
The culprit probably used it to climb up onto the veranda,

72
00:05:19,328 --> 00:05:22,428
broke the window and snuck in.

73
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:27,528
This room is facing the river bank, so not too many people would notice.

74
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,728
But isn't it strange?

75
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:33,528
This door, although the glass near the bottom lock is broken,

76
00:05:33,528 --> 00:05:36,428
the glass at the top isn't.

77
00:05:37,428 --> 00:05:41,128
Opening only the bottom lock won't open the door, will it?

78
00:05:41,128 --> 00:05:43,628
That part bothered us, too.

79
00:05:43,628 --> 00:05:45,528
Stop running around, Conan.

80
00:05:45,528 --> 00:05:49,328
Maybe it's because Mrs. Funemoto liked the stars during the night,

81
00:05:49,328 --> 00:05:52,228
she used to frequently come out to the veranda

82
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:54,528
and gaze at the stars.

83
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:57,228
So she may have forgotten to lock the door.

84
00:05:57,228 --> 00:05:59,828
Mrs. Funemoto was shot the night before last night,

85
00:05:59,828 --> 00:06:01,128
around 9:00 pm or 10:00 pm.

86
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:05,528
She just came back from a home party held by one of her friends, right?

87
00:06:05,528 --> 00:06:06,628
Yes.

88
00:06:06,628 --> 00:06:11,328
She came home and said she was going to her room to sleep.

89
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:14,828
Which means the culprit snuck into this room before she entered

90
00:06:14,828 --> 00:06:17,128
and was hiding somewhere in this room.

91
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:22,028
When Mrs. Funemoto stepped out to the veranda like always, he shot her.

92
00:06:24,228 --> 00:06:29,228
He fled after stealing the pearl necklace and bracelet she was wearing.

93
00:06:31,228 --> 00:06:34,028
So the culprit is a professional after all.

94
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:36,928
But it seems the culprit was in a bit of haste.

95
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:40,528
The culprit left the rope with the hook attached to it below the veranda

96
00:06:40,528 --> 00:06:44,528
as well as a rifle equipped with a silencer behind.

97
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:47,528
Well, I guess even a professional makes mistakes.

98
00:06:47,528 --> 00:06:49,528
But talk about a super klutz!

99
00:06:49,528 --> 00:06:54,028
Look. There is a pearl earring up here that's been left behind.

100
00:06:54,028 --> 00:06:57,428
It has a lot of jewellery around it and looks super expensive.

101
00:06:57,428 --> 00:06:59,628
I wonder why the culprit didn't take it?

102
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,828
You idiot.

103
00:07:00,828 --> 00:07:04,728
It's a pearl, so she probably wore it to the party

104
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:07,428
and she took it off right after coming in.

105
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,628
The culprit who was hiding probably didn't notice it.

106
00:07:10,828 --> 00:07:14,428
Mrs. Funemoto was wearing that earring that day.

107
00:07:14,428 --> 00:07:16,828
But it's strange. Why is there only one?

108
00:07:19,928 --> 00:07:22,628
The other side was on the ear of the victim, right?

109
00:07:22,628 --> 00:07:25,528
Yeah. She had it on her right ear.

110
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,228
I thought the culprit didn't notice it

111
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:30,628
because he was hiding against the wall of the veranda.

112
00:07:30,628 --> 00:07:34,028
If so, Mrs. Funemoto was a really scatterbrained person.

113
00:07:34,028 --> 00:07:35,228
What?

114
00:07:35,228 --> 00:07:38,428
I mean, she went out to the veranda after taking only one earring off.

115
00:07:38,428 --> 00:07:39,928
That doesn't seem normal, does it?

116
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:46,228
Well, I guess it can't be helped if someone called her out to the veranda

117
00:07:46,228 --> 00:07:47,528
when she was taking off her earrings though.

118
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:55,528
Pardon me, but where were you two days ago, between 9:00 pm and 10:00 pm?

119
00:07:55,528 --> 00:07:57,328
Me?

120
00:07:57,328 --> 00:08:00,728
I was together with my friends in the living room.

121
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:04,728
Did your friends also saw Mrs. Funemoto?

122
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:06,728
Yes, once after she came back.

123
00:08:06,728 --> 00:08:09,928
She came into the living room to say she's going to bed.

124
00:08:09,928 --> 00:08:11,428
Where was the boy then?

125
00:08:11,428 --> 00:08:14,028
I think he was already asleep in bed.

126
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:18,028
He was running around all over the house since sundown.

127
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:23,328
I cleaned up the mess he made and went to bed around midnight.

128
00:08:23,328 --> 00:08:26,728
Then, where was Mr. Funemoto at that time?

129
00:08:26,728 --> 00:08:28,828
He also went to sleep, as did his son.

130
00:08:28,828 --> 00:08:32,828
He had dinner and went to bed before Mrs. Funemoto came home.

131
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:36,628
His room was next to his wife's room, right?

132
00:08:36,628 --> 00:08:37,828
Yes.

133
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:43,228
He said he was tired since he has been keeping his son company all day.

134
00:08:43,228 --> 00:08:45,128
Inspector.

135
00:08:45,128 --> 00:08:48,528
Does that mean the husband is the culprit?

136
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:51,528
That's impossible.

137
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:52,828
I already told you, didn't I?

138
00:08:52,828 --> 00:08:55,528
Judging from the angle of the bullet entry point

139
00:08:55,528 --> 00:08:57,628
that pierced through the back of her head to her forehead,

140
00:08:57,628 --> 00:09:01,428
the culprit must be someone taller than 180 centimetres.

141
00:09:01,428 --> 00:09:04,828
Mr. Funemoto is approximately 160 centimetres.

142
00:09:04,828 --> 00:09:08,828
Moreover, someone who's sitting in a wheelchair couldn't have done it.

143
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:11,728
But what if his broken bone is actually already healed

144
00:09:11,728 --> 00:09:15,028
and he stood up on his wheelchair

145
00:09:15,028 --> 00:09:16,328
and fired the gun?

146
00:09:16,328 --> 00:09:18,928
I thought so too and asked the doctor about it,

147
00:09:18,928 --> 00:09:21,628
but the day before the incident, he took an X-Ray of his leg

148
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,728
and the bone was still not healed.

149
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:26,128
The doctor said he probably still cannot stand up on his own.

150
00:09:26,128 --> 00:09:30,628
Maybe he had her kneel over so he could shoot her from above?

151
00:09:30,628 --> 00:09:32,528
No way.

152
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:36,528
If so, there should be bullet hole somewhere in the room, right?

153
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:42,128
But there are no such hole anywhere in this room or this house.

154
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:44,028
Is that so?

155
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:46,728
We also looked for the pearl necklace and bracelet,

156
00:09:46,728 --> 00:09:48,728
but couldn't find them anywhere.

157
00:09:48,728 --> 00:09:51,328
Maybe they are in the trash?

158
00:09:51,328 --> 00:09:53,128
-In the trash? -I see.

159
00:09:53,128 --> 00:09:56,828
It could have something to do with the case Eisuke discovered.

160
00:09:56,828 --> 00:09:57,928
A case?

161
00:09:57,928 --> 00:09:59,128
What is it?

162
00:09:59,128 --> 00:10:03,128
There's a guy who's doing part-time work collecting trash from this area.

163
00:10:03,128 --> 00:10:08,028
It's for a group researching how to make trash harmless.

164
00:10:08,028 --> 00:10:10,628
It seems that he's been working from about two weeks ago,

165
00:10:10,628 --> 00:10:14,628
but there's no sign that this group checked the trash that was collected.

166
00:10:14,628 --> 00:10:15,928
I see.

167
00:10:15,928 --> 00:10:18,628
In other words, the husband killed his wife,

168
00:10:18,628 --> 00:10:21,228
and in order to make it look like a robbery,

169
00:10:21,228 --> 00:10:23,928
he threw the necklace and bracelet away as trash.

170
00:10:23,928 --> 00:10:26,728
He then asked someone to collect it for him.

171
00:10:26,728 --> 00:10:28,328
That can't be.

172
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:31,428
Unfortunately, that's not possible either.

173
00:10:31,428 --> 00:10:33,428
Of course we have checked inside the trash cans,

174
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:35,328
as well as inside the trash bags,

175
00:10:35,328 --> 00:10:36,728
but nothing was found.

176
00:10:36,728 --> 00:10:37,828
I see.

177
00:10:37,828 --> 00:10:40,928
How much was the necklace and bracelet worth?

178
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:43,828
I heard that it cost about one million yen for both.

179
00:10:43,828 --> 00:10:47,428
Mr. Funemoto bought them for his wife on her birthday.

180
00:10:47,428 --> 00:10:50,028
Her name is carved on the clasp.

181
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:51,128
Hey.

182
00:10:51,128 --> 00:10:52,328
Takami.

183
00:10:52,328 --> 00:10:55,428
Please turn the temperature of the air conditioner up!

184
00:10:55,428 --> 00:10:56,428
Yes, sir.

185
00:10:56,428 --> 00:10:58,728
Can't he use the remote controller?

186
00:10:58,728 --> 00:11:00,728
Mr. Funemoto is not good with machines.

187
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:05,228
Thank you.

188
00:11:05,228 --> 00:11:06,428
No problem.

189
00:11:08,228 --> 00:11:10,228
The officers are still here.

190
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:12,428
Did you come up with a clue on the culprit?

191
00:11:12,428 --> 00:11:14,328
No, not yet.

192
00:11:14,328 --> 00:11:16,928
Daddy, I'm hungry.

193
00:11:16,928 --> 00:11:18,428
It's this late already.

194
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,428
Shall we order a take-out again?

195
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:24,428
Hey, hey. It's about time for us to eat some of your homemade cooking.

196
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:26,428
Okay, I'll go make something right away.

197
00:11:28,828 --> 00:11:29,828
What's that?

198
00:11:30,828 --> 00:11:31,928
There's something here.

199
00:11:33,028 --> 00:11:34,028
Onion?

200
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:37,528
What can I make with what we have here?

201
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:40,028
If it's okay with you, I can help you.

202
00:11:40,028 --> 00:11:42,628
There seems to be a lot of unwashed dishes.

203
00:11:42,628 --> 00:11:46,328
After what happened to Mrs. Funemoto, I just can't seem to do anything.

204
00:11:46,328 --> 00:11:47,928
Would you please?

205
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:48,928
Yes.

206
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:53,728
The expiration date for these eggs is February 4th.

207
00:11:53,728 --> 00:11:56,128
That's yesterday, so I don't think you should use them.

208
00:11:57,328 --> 00:12:00,928
Wait a second. If February 4th was yesterday,

209
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,028
the night before would be...

210
00:12:03,028 --> 00:12:04,528
The 3rd.

211
00:12:04,528 --> 00:12:06,428
Wait, Ran!

212
00:12:06,428 --> 00:12:09,328
Hey, what did you make for dinner the day before yesterday?

213
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:12,028
Huh? The day before yesterday?

214
00:12:12,028 --> 00:12:13,928
Well...

215
00:12:13,928 --> 00:12:18,728
Yellowtail teriyaki, boiled vegetables, miso soup and tofu.

216
00:12:18,728 --> 00:12:19,828
I think that was it.

217
00:12:21,928 --> 00:12:23,328
That sounds delicious.

218
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:30,866
Takami, where's our meal?

219
00:12:30,866 --> 00:12:32,166
Oh, well...

220
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,066
We have to go shopping first.

221
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:37,366
Hurry up, then. I'm starving.

222
00:12:37,366 --> 00:12:38,466
Okay.

223
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:41,466
I guess we'll get going too, and then come back again.

224
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:42,566
Yes, sir.

225
00:12:42,566 --> 00:12:44,266
Then, I...

226
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:46,766
I'm...

227
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,366
You don't need me anymore?

228
00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:49,566
Yes.

229
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:50,866
Please wait.

230
00:12:50,866 --> 00:12:54,866
Don't you think this incident is related to the part-time job I mentioned?

231
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:56,666
Like I said...

232
00:12:56,666 --> 00:13:00,566
But why not check a little more? You may find some connection.

233
00:13:00,566 --> 00:13:01,966
Gosh...

234
00:13:16,066 --> 00:13:17,266
What's going on?

235
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:20,066
I just realized something now.

236
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:24,066
I figured out the culprit's trick on how to make the jewellery disappear.

237
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:27,266
It's the blind spot that we failed to notice.

238
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:28,866
Make it disappear?

239
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:31,166
Don't tell me they were flushed down the toilet?

240
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:34,466
We checked the sewers too, but we didn't find anything.

241
00:13:34,466 --> 00:13:37,866
Well, we'll talk about the details after the meal.

242
00:13:37,866 --> 00:13:39,966
If possible, we'd like you to cook for us, Ms. Shigeno.

243
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:40,966
Yes, right away.

244
00:13:40,966 --> 00:13:43,366
No, the ones who are going shopping

245
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:44,866
are Ran...

246
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,466
and Eisuke.

247
00:13:46,466 --> 00:13:49,766
We'll ask Mr. Funemoto's son, Toji, to go as well.

248
00:13:49,766 --> 00:13:52,266
Is that okay with you, Mr. Funemoto?

249
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:54,366
Yes, sure.

250
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:56,966
Hey.

251
00:13:56,966 --> 00:14:00,066
Just what is the meaning of this, Mr. Mouri?

252
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:03,666
I don't understand what you're talking about or trying to do at all!

253
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:07,666
Well, it's nothing unusual for him to change his views drastically.

254
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:11,166
He's still too young to know the truth.

255
00:14:12,366 --> 00:14:16,766
Imagine him knowing his mother was killed by his own father,

256
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:18,766
Mr. Tatsuhito Funemoto.

257
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:25,166
I thought its better if we don't tell your son just yet.

258
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:28,366
It seems certain that Mr. Funemoto was in his room

259
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:30,666
next to his wife's room at the time of the murder.

260
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,366
But he is only 160 centimetres tall and in a wheelchair.

261
00:14:33,366 --> 00:14:36,166
He can't go anywhere to hide the jewellery.

262
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:41,866
Just one pearl earring was left behind on the desk, wasn't it?

263
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:44,766
Yeah. Conan said earlier

264
00:14:44,766 --> 00:14:46,666
that maybe she was taking off her earring

265
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,266
when somebody called her out to the veranda.

266
00:14:49,266 --> 00:14:51,566
Inspector, doesn't it bother you?

267
00:14:51,566 --> 00:14:54,366
About how Mrs. Funemoto was called?

268
00:14:54,366 --> 00:14:57,066
What distracted her that she would forget to take off her other earring

269
00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:59,366
and go to the veranda?

270
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:01,666
Don't you want to know what those words were?

271
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,666
Words?

272
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,866
I presume this is what Mr. Funemoto told his wife.

273
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:09,066
It's a shooting star.

274
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:11,466
Look, right above.

275
00:15:12,466 --> 00:15:14,066
Shooting star?

276
00:15:14,066 --> 00:15:15,366
Above?

277
00:15:15,366 --> 00:15:16,566
I see!

278
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:18,566
A shooting star disappears right away,

279
00:15:18,566 --> 00:15:20,066
so she hurried off to the veranda to see it.

280
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:22,466
It's because she liked stars so much.

281
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:24,566
Then what does "above" means?

282
00:15:24,566 --> 00:15:25,866
If he made his wife look upwards,

283
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:27,766
he would shoot from a low position sitting in his wheelchair.

284
00:15:27,766 --> 00:15:30,066
The bullet would enter from the top part of the back of the head

285
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:33,166
and pierced through the forehead.

286
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:37,766
It would give an illusion as if someone who was tall had shot her.

287
00:15:37,766 --> 00:15:40,566
That way, the gun would be faced upwards.

288
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:42,366
No bullet hole would be left in the room,

289
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:44,466
because the bullets would go towards the river bank.

290
00:15:44,466 --> 00:15:46,366
What about the window glass?

291
00:15:46,366 --> 00:15:47,666
Since he's in a wheelchair,

292
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,266
he couldn't reach the window glass above.

293
00:15:50,266 --> 00:15:51,966
So he couldn't crack it.

294
00:15:51,966 --> 00:15:54,366
Then what about the pearl?

295
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:57,066
Let's say he killed his wife in the second floor room.

296
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:59,566
He couldn't have dispose of it outside, right?

297
00:15:59,566 --> 00:16:02,966
Mr. Funemoto's leg is broken.

298
00:16:02,966 --> 00:16:06,666
Did you really check the house thoroughly?

299
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,566
Yeah, we checked every place they could be.

300
00:16:10,566 --> 00:16:13,666
How about inside the vacuum cleaner?

301
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,266
Vacuum cleaner?

302
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,166
We actually didn't look there.

303
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,666
But Mr. Funemoto is not good with machines

304
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:22,066
and if he were to use it, it would make a loud noise.

305
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:23,766
Besides, a person in a wheelchair

306
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:27,166
couldn't possibly take out a vacuum cleaner with nobody noticing.

307
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:30,166
It's true that if Mr. Funemoto used the vacuum cleaner,

308
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,266
someone would notice.

309
00:16:32,266 --> 00:16:34,266
If Ms. Shigeno did, it's another story, right?

310
00:16:34,266 --> 00:16:35,266
Huh?

311
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:40,266
Please recall what those three did the day the murder was committed.

312
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:43,366
Toji was running around the first floor from sundown.

313
00:16:43,366 --> 00:16:46,866
Ms. Shigeno was cleaning up after Toji.

314
00:16:46,866 --> 00:16:49,066
What about it?

315
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:51,466
It's only natural that children run around and mess the place up.

316
00:16:51,466 --> 00:16:52,966
There's nothing's strange about it, right?

317
00:16:52,966 --> 00:16:56,866
Yes, but what if it was February 3rd?

318
00:16:57,866 --> 00:16:58,866
February...

319
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:00,266
3rd?

320
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:02,366
February 3rd is...

321
00:17:02,366 --> 00:17:03,566
You mean...

322
00:17:03,566 --> 00:17:07,866
Right. That day, an old custom handed down for generations is held.

323
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:09,866
It's Setsubun, right?

324
00:17:09,866 --> 00:17:10,966
Conan?

325
00:17:10,966 --> 00:17:11,966
Setsubun?

326
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:15,866
I'm sure that Toji had his father wear an ogre's mask

327
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:17,666
and was throwing beans saying,

328
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,866
"Devils out! Good luck in!"

329
00:17:20,866 --> 00:17:24,066
And Ms. Shigeno later got rid of everything.

330
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:25,566
Hey! Don't tell me that...

331
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:27,166
He took the pearls apart, mix them with the beans

332
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,766
and had her suck it up with the vacuum cleaner?

333
00:17:28,766 --> 00:17:32,766
The size and shape are similar. Moreover, there were a lot of them.

334
00:17:32,766 --> 00:17:35,766
If she began vacuuming after 11:00 pm,

335
00:17:35,766 --> 00:17:37,866
she must've wanted to finish as soon as possible.

336
00:17:37,866 --> 00:17:40,066
She wouldn't have noticed the pearls among the beans

337
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:42,566
and probably sucked everything up together.

338
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,866
So this is how the crime was carried out.

339
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:52,566
From sundown, Mr. Funemoto went throwing beans around the house with Toji.

340
00:17:52,566 --> 00:17:55,866
After his wife came back, he went to her room saying he wanted to talk.

341
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,966
He shot her on the veranda the way I mentioned a while ago.

342
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:01,166
He hooked a rope with a hook on it to the veranda railing

343
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:04,466
and cracked the glass to make it look a break-in.

344
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:09,466
Then he broke the pearl necklace and bracelet apart.

345
00:18:09,466 --> 00:18:11,966
He threw them down from the second floor railing

346
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,966
towards the carpet on the first floor and scattered them.

347
00:18:16,466 --> 00:18:17,866
All that's left to do is for Ms Shigeno

348
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:20,166
to suck them up with the vacuum cleaner.

349
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,466
Check the vacuum cleaner.

350
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:23,166
Yes, sir.

351
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:26,366
If Mr. Funemoto threw the vacuum cleaner bag out as burnable trash,

352
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:29,866
he didn't have to leave the house at all to get everything out of his way.

353
00:18:29,866 --> 00:18:32,566
Yes, after making the part-timer collect this,

354
00:18:32,566 --> 00:18:34,266
he would tell him that the work is over.

355
00:18:34,266 --> 00:18:37,766
After his leg has healed, he will take the pearls out of the trash.

356
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:39,566
He will put them back together again, hire another part-timer

357
00:18:39,566 --> 00:18:41,866
and make him take it to the pawn shop or something.

358
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:44,966
Since Mr. Funemoto's wife's name is on the clasp,

359
00:18:44,966 --> 00:18:49,666
it would look like a burglar or someone really did steal them.

360
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,166
But where's the proof?

361
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,366
You don't have proof, do you?

362
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,266
Fingerprints.

363
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:58,166
Was Mr. Funemoto's fingerprints found on the pearls?

364
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,666
They're married so I'm sure he has touched them eventually.

365
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,866
No, not the pearls.

366
00:19:01,866 --> 00:19:06,566
Mr. Funemoto used something to keep from getting gun powder traces on him.

367
00:19:06,566 --> 00:19:10,266
He pulled the trigger through the lace curtains.

368
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:15,266
I figured out what it was when I saw the onion on the wheelchair.

369
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:16,266
Onion?

370
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:20,866
The onion being there means that it was on his finger.

371
00:19:20,866 --> 00:19:23,366
He didn't realize that something he wore on his hand

372
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:26,366
had onion on it.

373
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:29,766
Yes, the kitchen rubber glove.

374
00:19:29,766 --> 00:19:33,466
Mr. Funemoto used the rubber gloves in the kitchen that he had hidden

375
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:34,966
to kill his wife.

376
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:38,066
The following day, you returned it secretly to the kitchen after breakfast.

377
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:41,766
Then you made Ms. Shigeno go check on your wife.

378
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:44,066
Inspector, we found the pearls in the vacuum cleaner!

379
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:46,966
Get the forensic officer and check the kitchen rubber gloves!

380
00:19:46,966 --> 00:19:47,966
Yes, sir!

381
00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:50,966
What Mr. Funemoto didn't expect was that, after the incident,

382
00:19:50,966 --> 00:19:53,966
Ms. Shigeno stopped cooking.

383
00:19:53,966 --> 00:19:58,166
That's why you asked her to make something a while ago, didn't you?

384
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:01,766
You wanted Ms. Shigeno to put on the rubber gloves to wash the dishes.

385
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:06,666
Your fingerprints would be mixed with hers on the inside of the gloves.

386
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,466
You wanted the gun powder traces on the gloves to wash off

387
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:09,566
so that nothing would be detected.

388
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:12,766
Mr. Funemoto.

389
00:20:12,766 --> 00:20:15,866
Please tell me if I'm wrong in any way.

390
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:18,166
Mr. Funemoto, please say...

391
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,766
Please say it's all a lie!

392
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,266
Did you know?

393
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:25,266
That she was addicted to partying?

394
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:28,066
For the past six months,

395
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:31,866
I had to stay home because of my injury.

396
00:20:31,866 --> 00:20:33,266
I didn't notice at all

397
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:35,366
that my wife had accumulated expenses

398
00:20:35,366 --> 00:20:38,066
in order to hold parties once a week

399
00:20:38,066 --> 00:20:40,166
and was in great debt.

400
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,466
I didn't think she would go that far.

401
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:45,466
Money! Money! I don't have money!

402
00:20:46,866 --> 00:20:49,866
That's right. I'll use this house as collateral and borrow money.

403
00:20:49,866 --> 00:20:50,866
Hey, you...

404
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:53,566
I'll divorce you if you want.

405
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:58,066
It seems that you no longer make me shine.

406
00:20:58,066 --> 00:21:01,766
I've got plenty of other sponsors to go to.

407
00:21:01,766 --> 00:21:02,766
Hey.

408
00:21:02,766 --> 00:21:04,866
I'm not going to take care of Toji either.

409
00:21:04,866 --> 00:21:07,066
I'm sick and tired of raising a child already.

410
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:11,066
Divorced with a child doesn't suit a star like me, does it?

411
00:21:13,266 --> 00:21:15,766
I just couldn't forgive her for what she said,

412
00:21:15,766 --> 00:21:17,766
despite being a wife and mother.

413
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:19,066
I'm home!

414
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:20,166
Daddy!

415
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,566
What's the matter?

416
00:21:22,566 --> 00:21:23,766
Are you crying?

417
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:26,566
If so, let's throw beans again and cheer up!

418
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:29,366
I'm sure that will make mommy in heaven happy.

419
00:21:30,966 --> 00:21:33,266
I guess so, Toji.

420
00:21:33,266 --> 00:21:36,266
I'm going to leave you and go out for a while.

421
00:21:37,766 --> 00:21:42,766
Because I'm an ogre that took away a precious person from you.

422
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:12,366
He went home?

423
00:23:12,366 --> 00:23:15,366
After showering Toji with questions,

424
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:17,466
he suddenly said he had something to do.

425
00:23:17,466 --> 00:23:18,766
Showering him with questions?

426
00:23:18,766 --> 00:23:20,066
He asked about the accident Toji saw

427
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,966
and about the foreign lady who questioned him.

428
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:25,766
Toji said that when he asked the lady who she was,

429
00:23:25,766 --> 00:23:28,966
-the lady seems to have answered "Uma-uma" in English. -Uma-uma?

430
00:23:28,966 --> 00:23:30,066
I wonder what it means.

431
00:23:30,066 --> 00:23:31,066
Uma...

432
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:32,766
Uma-uma?

433
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:38,966
A secret makes a woman a woman.

434
00:23:38,966 --> 00:23:40,366
Vermouth?

435
00:23:41,466 --> 00:23:43,066
Hondo.

436
00:23:43,066 --> 00:23:45,166
It's the name of that guy.

437
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:47,566
You mean the one that Kir killed?

438
00:23:47,566 --> 00:23:48,766
Yeah.

439
00:23:48,766 --> 00:23:51,266
His friend kept calling out to him,

440
00:23:51,266 --> 00:23:54,566
as if chanting, despite him not being able to hear a thing.

441
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,466
Hondo...

442
00:23:57,466 --> 00:23:58,866
Like so.

443
00:24:46,966 --> 00:24:48,666
Next Conan's Hint:

444
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:51,266
"The gloves of a snowman"

445
00:24:51,266 --> 00:24:54,266
-Officer Takagi, read "te-bu-ku-ro" backwards. -I'm not falling for it.

446
00:24:54,266 --> 00:24:56,166
It hurts! I didn't say anything!
