1
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,510
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,310
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,010
Today, the secret code is solved.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,110
A small hint becomes a big thing.

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,610
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,610
A child in appearance with the I.Q of an adult.

7
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,010
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,050
After helping a toy company,

9
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,850
Dr. Agasa received a sum of money

10
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,650
and he planned the treasure hunt for the Youth Detective Squad.

11
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,150
The location is the second house of Agasa's uncle.

12
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,150
No one should be in the house for 50 years since he died

13
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:59,320
but there were traces of someone living there secretly

14
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,600
with strange codes.

15
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,400
There were symbols like a moon, a star,

16
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,700
and on things like a vase, a plate, and a candle stand.

17
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,400
We found out toys hidden by Dr. Agasa

18
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,100
for the treasure hunt were tattered

19
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,800
so we felt that there was a big secret in this house.

20
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,400
We found out 7 secret codes

21
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,800
after looking around the house.

22
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,400
Cards, French dictionary, record,

23
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,500
airplane, wine glass, portrait,

24
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,700
and gadget doll.

25
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:50,400
Dr. Agasa also remembered the same codes

26
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,300
on a letter from the his aunt.

27
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,800
And he brought it to my father, a detective story novelist.

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,900
Right. That novelist knew too.

29
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,900
This secret code was all in "hiragana".

30
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,100
Hiragana?

31
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,200
Conan, is it true?

32
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,100
It's best to think that the sender of those letters

33
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,600
and the person who wrote this secret code

34
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,700
are both the same person.

35
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,800
But why did he send the secret code to my aunt?

36
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,100
He didn't want anybody but your aunt to know.

37
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,600
For example, someone was after him.

38
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Come to think of it, my aunt said this.

39
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,000
A strange guy often peeks into the mailbox.

40
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,000
That's probably the guy who slashed up the toys.

41
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,500
Something is going on in this house.

42
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:54,900
"Secret of the Moon, the Star, and the Sun (Part 2)"

43
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,800
But even if we know that this secret code is in "hiragana",

44
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,500
we haven't the faintest idea what's it about.

45
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,800
Don't worry. If there's a hint, we've got it in the bag.

46
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,900
What?

47
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,300
For example, black sun.

48
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,200
White sun, moon, star, and black moon,

49
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,100
there's differences in the shape of the stars

50
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,300
but none in the black sun.

51
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,900
In "hiragana",

52
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,400
what's the letter that doesn't have a "step" or a "line"

53
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,800
an outcast letter?

54
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,300
Doesn't have a step or line?

55
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,000
An outcast?

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,800
I know! It's "un", right?

57
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,000
That's it! The black sun represents "un".

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The next thing to look at is

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,400
the three figures on the right

60
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,200
that are the same in all the codes.

61
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,400
It means that they hold a different meaning

62
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,600
from the ones in the front.

63
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,000
I see.

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,700
Next is the small black and white circles around the figures.

65
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,200
We don't know the meaning of the black circle on the bottom right,

66
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,700
but the black and white circles on the upper right

67
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,000
judging from the position,

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,600
they're probably G, Z and P sound points of "hiragana".

69
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,700
Hey, what does G, Z and P sound points mean?

70
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,700
Don't you remember learning it at school?

71
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,900
G, Z sound points are those two raised slash-marks

72
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,900
on the top right of the letter,

73
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,800
they make up the "G" sounds and the "Z" sounds.

74
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,000
The P sound point is that raised circle on the top right that

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,600
make up the sounds "PA, PI, PU, PE, PO"!

76
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,300
Let's take a look at the code again.

77
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,800
The crescent moon facing up has a black circle,

78
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,400
a white circle and no circle. There are three types.

79
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,900
In other words, this crescent moon facing upward

80
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,300
is one of the "HA" line letters.

81
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,300
I see! The "HA" line is the only one

82
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,500
that has G, Z and P sound points.

83
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,100
With that in mind,

84
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,700
the easiest to read would be this wine glass code.

85
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,900
The four letters excluding the three on the right.

86
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,700
The third black sun is "un".

87
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,800
The fourth is a letter in the "pa" line.

88
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,400
A word that uses letters "un" and one in the "pa" line...

89
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,600
Panty, hairpin, pelican...

90
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,700
Anpan bread, melon bread, curry bread...

91
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,800
Personal computer, Japan, lamp...

92
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,900
"To, ra, un, pu". It's cards!

93
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,500
That's right! This probably says "cards".

94
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,900
Wait a minute. If so...

95
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,100
The secret code written on this candle stand...

96
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,000
The first letters "pu" and the fourth letter will be "ra"...

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,600
Pu... ra...

98
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,800
"Pu, ro, pe, ra"!

99
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,900
I see! It's "propeller"!

100
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,700
Wait. If this black crescent moon is "ro",

101
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,400
this code...

102
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,200
Pu, ro, pe, ra... ro...

103
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,800
Look.

104
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,500
Look at the propeller!

105
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,900
There's a code written on the backside of the plane's propeller.

106
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,300
There sure is!

107
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,000
If the black circle on the upper right is a G, Z sound point,

108
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,900
the second letter is "bu", the third letter is "ra".

109
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,100
Look at... "bu ra".

110
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,300
"Bu ra"?

111
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,000
"Ah, bu, ra, eh"...

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,300
Look at the oil painting!

113
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,300
It's talking about this portrait.

114
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,100
All right, I've got it!

115
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:15,300
The phrase "look at" is stuck on to everything named in this house.

116
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,600
In other words, if you follow those clues,

117
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,900
you'll reach something.

118
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:25,200
Something so important a secret code had to be used to hide it.

119
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,800
Really?

120
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,300
Okay, we'll solve all the codes and get the treasure!

121
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,000
Yes!

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,800
Hey. Is there really a treasure hidden here?

123
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,600
I don't know if it's treasure,

124
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,000
but there's no mistake that something is hidden.

125
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,600
Let's see. The code on the plate is...

126
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,300
The third is "un",

127
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,000
the second is a letter that has a G, Z sound point, so...

128
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,800
Let's see... "Ka, bi, un"?

129
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,600
Vase! The vase!

130
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,200
The secret code on the dictionary is...

131
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,400
Let's see... "Un, ro"...

132
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,300
"Da, un, ro"!

133
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,500
It's the fireplace!

134
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,900
If so, then the code on he gadget doll is...

135
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,900
"Wa, I, un, gu, ra, su"...

136
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,300
It's the wine glass!

137
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,100
Huh? Conan.

138
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,400
Until now, there's 17 letters that we know.

139
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,800
And if we make deductions from the code...

140
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,100
from the blank portions...

141
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,400
Are you saying something?

142
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,300
Here! Take a look at this!

143
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,400
This is the chart to decode the secret code.

144
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,300
This is great!

145
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,700
As you can see,

146
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,300
the sun, moon, and stars are "A, E, I, O, U" that mark each line.

147
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,000
And all of it follow the same rule,

148
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,700
you can tell it goes sideways too.

149
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,900
For example, the sun and star...

150
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,300
The thorns surrounding it are missing clockwise from the top.

151
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,800
The moon goes clockwise too.

152
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,400
And the black circle on the bottom right, that was a mystery,

153
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,600
was a mark added when there wasn't enough figures.

154
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
I see.

155
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,400
Furthermore, if you use that chart to read all the secret codes

156
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,900
and connect them together...

157
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,100
-This is what it becomes. -What?

158
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,700
Let's see. Look at the vase.

159
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,500
Look at the candle stand.

160
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,900
Look at the propeller.

161
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,300
Look at the oil painting.

162
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,800
Look at the record.

163
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,200
Look at the doll.

164
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,700
Look at the wine glass.

165
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,000
Look at the card.

166
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,800
Look at the French dictionary.

167
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,900
Look at the fireplace.

168
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,100
The fireplace!

169
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,000
Then, the treasure is in the fireplace!

170
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,400
What's this? There's nothing here.

171
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,800
A secret code! There's a secret code carved!

172
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,800
What? Really?

173
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,200
Ayumi, lend me that decoding chart.

174
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Sure!

175
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,600
Here, Conan.

176
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,900
Let's see, that code is...

177
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,100
Hey. What's written?

178
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,100
Hurry up and tell us!

179
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,200
-Conan! -Don't keep us waiting.

180
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,400
-Plates... -Huh?

181
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,200
Look at the plate.

182
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,300
What?

183
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,000
Plate? The first plate we saw?

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Gosh. We're right back where we started.

185
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,700
The code is spinning us in circles

186
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,400
You're kidding.

187
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,200
It's just a bad joke.

188
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,300
Joke? That can't be.

189
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,500
Using a secret code that maybe wouldn't be able to decoded?

190
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Would he do something so complicated?

191
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,200
But if you follow the code, you go back to the beginning.

192
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,300
Or, is it saying that this decoding chart is wrong?

193
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,400
No, that can't be.

194
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,700
There's gotta be something in the order of this code.

195
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,400
A true meaning.

196
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,400
It can't be helped.

197
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,100
Let's put everything back to where they were

198
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,800
before the police arrive.

199
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,800
Yes...

200
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,000
Let's see. The plate was in the cupboard.

201
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,200
Wait a minute!

202
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,100
If you connect the first letters of these plate and vase...

203
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,500
"Sa, ka, ro, pu, ah, re, ni, wa, to, fu, da"...

204
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,300
What's that?

205
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,800
The vase goes here.

206
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,100
Maybe if you change it to roman characters...

207
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,600
The candle stand goes on the fireplace.

208
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,900
I guess not.

209
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,300
Dr. Agasa, this airplane... where was it?

210
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,700
It was beside that vase. I took it to the bedroom.

211
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,200
Beside the vase...

212
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,400
Maybe I should try changing it to English?

213
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,800
No, maybe French?

214
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,900
Or maybe German?

215
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,500
Record...

216
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,800
Nothing seems to ring a bell.

217
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,900
Doll...

218
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,100
Huh?

219
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Hey.

220
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,800
Why don't you help out a bit?

221
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,900
Don't just sit in the middle of the room.

222
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,400
Hey, Dr. Agasa.

223
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,600
You said the cards were in this room too, didn't you?

224
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,300
Yes. They were originally right below the clock,

225
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,600
but I used them.

226
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,700
Which means...

227
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,700
all the items with the code written on them were in this room.

228
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,900
Wait a minute.

229
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,700
If you connect them with a line...

230
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,700
Start from the plate, the vase, the candle stand,

231
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,900
propeller, oil painting, record,

232
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,400
doll, wine glass, card,

233
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,800
French dictionary, fireplace, and the plate.

234
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,000
It's concentrated in the center of the room!

235
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,400
That's why Ayumi has passed by me so many times.

236
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,000
But that's strange.

237
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,200
This is the center of the room,

238
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,800
but there's nothing different about it.

239
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,700
It's not on the floor.

240
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,500
A groove at the base of the chandelier?

241
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,500
-Let's put off the treasure hunt... -Dr. Agasa!

242
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,500
-Let me ride your shoulder! -What?

243
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,800
Hurry!

244
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,900
All right.

245
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,800
Whoop!

246
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,100
What is this sound?

247
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,900
Hey, what's going on?

248
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,900
Sounds like something fell upstairs.

249
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,800
Let's go and see!

250
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,000
Hey, Conan!

251
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,790
Right above that room...

252
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,690
is this room.

253
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,090
Conan, what's going on?

254
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:42,090
There's stairs in the room.

255
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,890
I see. So, that's it!

256
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,290
That code was pointing at the chandelier trick

257
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,190
in the center of the room.

258
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:52,790
In other words, it was pointing out the hidden stairs in this room.

259
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,090
I heard that my uncle liked gadgets,

260
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,890
but I didn't think he had something like this set up.

261
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:04,090
Then, could the treasure be up there?

262
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,590
Yes, something is hidden, that's for sure.

263
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,390
All right, let's hurry!

264
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,490
What's this room?

265
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,790
It's pitch black.

266
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,790
At this rate, we can't see anything.

267
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,990
Anyway, let's open the window.

268
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:27,790
Unfinished 1 yen coins. And...

269
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,990
this is is a tube of oil paint.

270
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,690
Look! Something's on the desk.

271
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,590
Is it treasure?

272
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,890
Hey, what's the matter?

273
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,090
What is it? Speak up.

274
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,690
Skeleton!

275
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,990
What?

276
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,390
Who is that corpse?

277
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,490
Didn't I tell you a while ago?

278
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,290
There was an old person with skilled hands living here.

279
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,990
He's probably the one who carved the 1 yen coin

280
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,790
and wrote those secret codes.

281
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,390
He wasn't killed, was he?

282
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:18,390
No. He passed away while writing a letter to your aunt.

283
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:22,190
Looks like he had a bad heart.

284
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,990
But how did he know about this hidden room?

285
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,090
The only ones who knew about it

286
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:30,890
were my uncle and aunt who lived here.

287
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,590
There's one other, isn't there?

288
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,290
Before your uncle died,

289
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,690
there was a person who was and out of this house.

290
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,890
Before my uncle died?

291
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,790
Oh, that painting!

292
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:46,590
Right. The portrait of your aunt and uncle

293
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,690
is that artist who painted that picture.

294
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,690
He probably heard about this hidden room from your uncle

295
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,690
while doing the painting.

296
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,390
But why did he have to live and hide here?

297
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:01,290
And why he send those coded letters to my aunt?

298
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,990
That reason is probably this.

299
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,490
Huh? What's this?

300
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,090
This is...

301
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,490
A 20 dollar bill printing plate?

302
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,290
Counterfeit!

303
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:16,690
Right. He was probably asked by someone to make it.

304
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:19,990
But it bothered him and he disappeared with the plate.

305
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,690
To escape from that somebody, he hid and lived here.

306
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,590
Those letters he wrote to your aunt

307
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:29,790
were to show her his appreciation for letting him live here.

308
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,690
He used the secret code because he didn't want anybody,

309
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,090
other than your aunt, to know where he was.

310
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:41,290
Then, that person who was peeking into my aunt's mailbox was...

311
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,490
Yes, it's the person who order the counterfeit.

312
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,390
And the person who slashed up the toys you hid

313
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,590
is also the same person.

314
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,590
An excellent answer.

315
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,240
I thought I'd found where that guy was

316
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,440
and where he hid the printing plate.

317
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,640
But there were only toys in the box

318
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,540
and I slashed them up.

319
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,740
I heard that he was friendly with the owner of this house

320
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,240
and suspected this was the place,

321
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,840
but I didn't know there was a hidden room.

322
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,240
Thanks, kids.

323
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,840
You rat!

324
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:26,040
Don't move! I don't want to make a murderer of myself.

325
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,740
And if you make the wrong move and the bullet hits the plate,

326
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,740
it won't be of any use.

327
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,140
Gosh!

328
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,040
Young lady.

329
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,040
That's right, you.

330
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,740
Get that printing plate from the old man

331
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,340
and bring it over here.

332
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,240
That's it. You're a good girl.

333
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,040
If you can bring it right over to me,

334
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,040
I'll give you a reward.

335
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,440
You brat! You want to get blown away?

336
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,940
Don't panic. I'll give it to you later.

337
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,640
Tomoaki Okuda.

338
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,740
Why do you know my name?

339
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,240
I heard it from that person a while ago.

340
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,340
How can a corpse talk?

341
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,040
Listen. If you listen closely, you can hear him.

342
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,340
His spirit is probably still wandering around here.

343
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,740
You brat! If you make anymore wise-cracks...

344
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,340
Tomoaki Okuda.

345
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,940
Tomoaki Okuda.

346
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,440
Tomoaki Okuda.

347
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,140
Tomoaki Okuda.

348
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:05,240
Well, just as promised, I'll give you this.

349
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,240
Take it!

350
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,340
Conan! Let's escape while we can!

351
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,540
Huh?

352
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,540
That's right! If that ghost appears again...

353
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,840
Oh, that voice...

354
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,740
It's this.

355
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,440
The Yaiba Reco-changer!

356
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,640
I recorded my voice

357
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,740
and played it over and over again in slow.

358
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:41,540
But how did you know that guy's name?

359
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:46,040
It was written in secret code on that unfinished letter on the desk.

360
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,840
It said, "I don't want this masterpiece

361
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,940
to get in the hands of Tomoaki Okuda".

362
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,640
I see.

363
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,440
He wanted to leave this masterpiece in the hands of my aunt

364
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,940
whom he was indebted to in the past

365
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,040
so he left the secret codes in this house

366
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,340
to let her know where he was.

367
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:06,040
Hey. That aunt... what is she doing now?

368
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,740
She passed away last year, at age 76.

369
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,340
She never got married.

370
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,240
Maybe it wasn't only because he was indebted to her in the past.

371
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,640
Two hours later, the police arrived

372
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,840
and Tomoaki Okuda was arrested.

373
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,540
We finally got to go home.

374
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,340
But I don't understand.

375
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,540
Huh?

376
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:05,440
You know, those words that your father said...

377
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,240
Dr. Agasa, you're like the sun!

378
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:14,440
For a while after that, he called me "Dr. Sun".

379
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,940
Oh, that.

380
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,740
It's just a joke.

381
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,240
A joke?

382
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,440
Look at our name with this decoding chart.

383
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,440
Huh?

384
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,840
They're all suns, aren't they?

385
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,040
I see!

386
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,040
This is funny!

387
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,140
I'm Dr. Sun!

388
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,440
"Next Episode" -What?

389
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,640
There's somebody outside!

390
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,440
It's finally just us.

391
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,140
Even we were being fooled,

392
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,840
it's absolutely unforgivable!

393
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,240
Conan!

394
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,740
Run, Mitsuhiko!

395
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,440
Next Conan,

396
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,760
"Disappearance of the Youth Detective Squad"

397
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,640
Next Conan's Hint:

398
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,140
"Number of dolls"

399
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,140
The Youth Detective Squad does a great job on the next episode too.

400
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,940
Looks like Mitsuhiko will be the main character.
