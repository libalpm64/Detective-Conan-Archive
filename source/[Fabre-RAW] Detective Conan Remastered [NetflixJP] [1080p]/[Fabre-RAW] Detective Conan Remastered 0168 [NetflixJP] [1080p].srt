1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,690
Just as flowing water has no form

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,490
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,590
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,190
Mystery of Trick Ridge is coming to an end.

5
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,490
Heiji and I solve the mystery perfectly.

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,990
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,090
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,790
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,120
Hattori and Kazuha are called out to the Takeda home

10
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,920
on Trick Ridge in Tottori Prefecture.

11
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,720
The two get lost

12
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,020
and meet up with a foreigner by the name of Robert Taylor.

13
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,820
We were also called out to the Takeda home

14
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,720
and accidentally meet up with them on the way there.

15
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,120
We were called to solve the mystery of the curse

16
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,420
of the "Spider Mansion of Trick Ridge".

17
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,620
On the night of our arrival,

18
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,020
the oldest son of the Takeda family, Nobukazu

19
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,120
commits suicide on the 2nd floor of the storehouse.

20
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,820
In addition, Kazuha is attacked

21
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,720
and found tangled in strings in the same storehouse.

22
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,320
This is...

23
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,320
Ka...

24
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,520
Kazuha!

25
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,220
Name card?

26
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,820
Here, this is it.

27
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,020
I got it out somehow.

28
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,620
-Hey, this is... -No way...

29
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,320
You're kidding.

30
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,720
Isn't it a stun gun?

31
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,420
She didn't see the murderer,

32
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,320
but she said she found a strange ball in front of the storehouse.

33
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,720
Ball?

34
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,220
She said that it was a ball about this small.

35
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,820
BB shot!

36
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,320
-That's it! -There was that method!

37
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,120
If that's so...

38
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,320
I found it! Hattori, it's here!

39
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,320
I've found it too.

40
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,020
Strange string with loops on the beam ends.

41
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,620
There's no mistake. That person is the murderer!

42
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,720
"Mystery Of The Spider Mansion Of Tottori (Part 3)"

43
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,520
What? He knows who the murderer is?

44
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,720
Did Mr. Mouri really say that?

45
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,820
That's right.

46
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,620
He said for everyone to gather on the 2nd floor of the storehouse.

47
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,620
Oh, yes. He also said to bring that big doll in the workshop too.

48
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,620
Also, it would help if there is some spare gasoline.

49
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,020
Hey, what's that kid from Osaka up to?

50
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,920
Bringing the corpse down without permission.

51
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,920
Did he really say to wait there?

52
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,820
That's right.

53
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,320
Oh, you're all here.

54
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,020
Well, let me start to tell you about the many incidents

55
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,920
that have happened here at the Takeda home.

56
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,720
Mr. Mouri, please wait.

57
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,820
When we found brother,

58
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,020
the door was locked from the inside.

59
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,720
There's only that one small window

60
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,020
barely large enough for a child to get through.

61
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,720
I don't think it's a curse.

62
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,420
But if you say there's a murderer, will you explain to us first?

63
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,120
How the murderer escaped from this room?

64
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,320
If there's a way like that...

65
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,620
I'm the one who'd like to know how it was done.

66
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,620
Hah?

67
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,820
Right.

68
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,020
The criminal had no need to escape from here.

69
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,620
That's because, when he murdered Nobukazu,

70
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,120
the murderer wasn't in this room.

71
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,920
Impossible.

72
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,920
Then, how did he do it?

73
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,420
The strings used for the puppets.

74
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:48,020
The murderer used puppet strings, ropes, and thumbtacks

75
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,020
to commit this crime in a sealed room.

76
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,920
The set-up is simple.

77
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,920
First, the rope is set-up

78
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,720
so that the loop closes when it is pulled

79
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,220
and it is tied to the beam.

80
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,120
Then, with stalls loops made on both ends of the string,

81
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,220
the loop of the rope is pulled to four corners,

82
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,120
and fixed to the small window with thumbtacks.

83
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,320
Another long string is attached

84
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,920
to the base of the loop of that rope.

85
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,520
It is put over the beam in the center of the room

86
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,620
and lends out the small window

87
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,220
and the set-up is completed.

88
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,520
Look.

89
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,420
Like this.

90
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,720
Little boy.

91
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,920
All that's left to do is call Nobukazu out here,

92
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,420
make him look out of the window,

93
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,020
and pull the string.

94
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,820
The loop of the rope closes

95
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,220
and he is able to murder Nobukazu.

96
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,920
But, why did brother lock the door?

97
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,320
And...

98
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,320
anyone would think it strange

99
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,120
if he was told by the person he was waiting for

100
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,820
to look out the window.

101
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,020
He locked the door because it was something important

102
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,420
and he didn't want anyone to see him.

103
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,620
He looked out the window

104
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,820
because he probably heard a sound.

105
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,320
-A sound? -Yes.

106
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,420
The criminal fired BB shots at the window with an air gun,

107
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:18,820
so that Nobukazu would look out the window.

108
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,420
It was to avenge Misa

109
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:25,220
who committed suicide in this storehouse three years ago!

110
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,120
Mi... Misa's revenge?

111
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,720
Yes. The criminal probably thought that

112
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,620
Nobukazu having found out that Misa wasn't his real daughter

113
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,120
went hard on her

114
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,320
and forced her into committing suicide.

115
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,620
Not his real daughter?

116
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,020
What does it mean?

117
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,020
Isn't that right, Ryuji?

118
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,520
Dear?

119
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,920
I'm sorry, Yuko.

120
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,120
I know I had to tell you about it, sooner or later but...

121
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,720
Misa, that child

122
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:07,220
is the daughter made between brother's wife Kinuyo and I...

123
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,520
You're joking, aren't you?

124
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,020
Dear.

125
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,520
It's true.

126
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,020
It was before I met you.

127
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,020
Kinuyo was told at the hospital

128
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,420
that brother could not have children

129
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,520
and she pleaded me with tears.

130
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,720
He wants a child. "Please make his dream come true", she said.

131
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,520
That was the first and last time.

132
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,720
Brother and I have the same blood type,

133
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,720
so he wouldn't have found out.

134
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,920
Until three years ago

135
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,820
when the doctor at the hospital slipped his mouth...

136
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,220
Misa ended up committing suicide

137
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,220
and Kinuyo, feeling responsible, followed her.

138
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,720
It's all because I listened to her plead.

139
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,620
Dear.

140
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,520
But how did you know I was Misa's father?

141
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,820
Kinuyo and I didn't tell anyone.

142
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,720
Her name.

143
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,120
Misa and the daughters of you and Yoko,

144
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,920
their names resemble each other

145
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,220
"Misa, Sae, Emi" -and form a circle.

146
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,020
I recognized that and knew.

147
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,220
You secretly made the names of your daughters'

148
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,120
have relation to one another.

149
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,920
It's also seems like you were unusually upset

150
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,620
at Misa and Kinuyo's funerals.

151
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,120
But, mother named all the daughters...

152
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,920
I knew.

153
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:44,320
I named the three to form a circle for you.

154
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,420
Don't take an old person for fool.

155
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,820
When Kinuyo came home from the hospital with the baby,

156
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:58,020
I knew right away from the way you two acted.

157
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,920
But, I didn't think you'd take revenge

158
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,820
for the daughter whose suicide,

159
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,720
and your older brother, Nobukazu, was responsible for.

160
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,920
Making it look like the curse of the Spider Empress.

161
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
You're disgusting.

162
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,520
Mother, you're wrong. I didn't kill brother.

163
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,520
Ryuji isn't the murderer.

164
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,920
I said, didn't I?

165
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,520
That the murderer fired an air gun at the window

166
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,720
and when Nobukazu looked out the window,

167
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,620
the string was pulled and he was killed.

168
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,120
Even if the room was sealed,

169
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,020
if someone made movements in front of the storehouse like that,

170
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,120
he'd immediately be suspicions.

171
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,720
The way this set-up was made,

172
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,320
there would have to be more than human strength used

173
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,820
or the rate of failure would be very high.

174
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,720
To make it successful,

175
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,020
you would need the strength to pull the thumbtacks,

176
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,520
on all four corners, off at once.

177
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,020
Without being noticed by anyone,

178
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,020
there's only one person who could have done that.

179
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,620
You're the only one!

180
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,010
Without being noticed by anyone,

181
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,010
there's only one person who could have done that.

182
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,010
You're the only one!

183
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:27,110
You used the car to visit the grave with the girls.

184
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,610
Robert.

185
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,510
You're the only one who could've done it.

186
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,110
After dinner, when you were going out to visit the grave,

187
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,110
you parked the car in front of the storehouse.

188
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,410
You waited for the girls to come running over

189
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,810
to the car that was waiting.

190
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:51,810
You could have shot at the storehouse window from the driver's seat.

191
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:55,310
And, beforehand you could have leads the strings out the window.

192
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,910
If you tied it to the car before dinner,

193
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,810
all you would have to do is drive the car,

194
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,010
you'd be able to pull with great strength.

195
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:07,010
The string that was left on the car was retrieved in the mountains

196
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,010
when you stopped to look at the scenery

197
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:14,610
and was thrown away somewhere along with the air gun.

198
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,710
Please wait a minute.

199
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:19,910
Yes, I'm definitely the one who moved the car but...

200
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:24,110
It could have been someone else that tied the string to the car.

201
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,210
And, I hadn't been here for 3 years.

202
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,810
I just arrived today, didn't I?

203
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,210
I forgot where the house was and even got lost.

204
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,510
From the time I arrived here to the time we went to visit the grave,

205
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,810
I was with you almost all that time.

206
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,510
I wouldn't have the time to rigged a setup like this.

207
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,210
No.

208
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,510
It haven't been three years since you visited here.

209
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,210
It's several days ago.

210
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,310
Right.

211
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:52,310
You murdered Mr. Negishi and rigged this set-up on that day.

212
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,110
What's that?

213
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,610
That's why only Mr. Negishi was killed in the barn.

214
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,210
He avoided this room that was rigged with the set-up.

215
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,110
The high school detective from Osaka

216
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,210
was called out with a strange request.

217
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,310
He made the meeting on the road look accidental

218
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:13,810
to make it look like who hadn't been here for three years.

219
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:17,910
No one would suspect a person, who was lost

220
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,810
and picked up by an Osaka detective on the road,

221
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:27,310
to have something like this set up beforehand.

222
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:30,210
But, why kill Mr. Negishi?

223
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,910
Well, I don't know that yet, but...

224
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,910
I know for sure that Robert found out about Misa's suicide

225
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,010
and the narcotics at that time.

226
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,910
Narcotics?

227
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:46,610
Yes. Nobukazu worked with Mr. Negishi

228
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,810
stuffing the dolls with narcotics

229
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,210
and selling them at a high price.

230
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,810
Brother dealing narcotics?

231
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,910
That can't be true.

232
00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:01,510
If you don't believe me, check out the dolls in the workshop later.

233
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:06,510
The dolls are filled with narcotics.

234
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,810
And, after killing Mr. Negishi,

235
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,810
Robert stole one of the dolls that Mr. Negishi

236
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,710
was planning to take with him.

237
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,710
The next day,

238
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:20,210
he made the plans to call Nobikazu out to this room.

239
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,810
"If you're interested in narcotics,

240
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:25,610
I've got some good drugs want to make a deal...

241
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,610
is probably what he said on the phone,

242
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:32,310
Nobikazu suspected someone in the family of killing Mr. Negishi

243
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,810
and stealing the narcotics

244
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,310
and he jumped at the phone call.

245
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:41,710
He was called out to this room where the trap was set up

246
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:46,010
and was murdered.

247
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,210
Am I wrong?

248
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,710
Stop.

249
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,010
You don't have proof and you're making false accusations.

250
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:56,010
And, you're forgetting something important.

251
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:02,210
Explain the mystery why Nobukazu was tangled in the strings.

252
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,110
Was he really...

253
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:20,410
Hey, old man! I'm ready!

254
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,010
Right, right.

255
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,710
I completely forgot about it until you mentioned it.

256
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:29,110
That thing about Nobukazu being tangled in the strings.

257
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,910
That set-up has been taken care of too,

258
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,210
hasn't it, Conan?

259
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,510
Look. It was dark and you probably didn't see it, but...

260
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:44,610
Strings are attached to the rope that's tied to the beam!

261
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:49,310
Proof rather than discussion, let's actually try it.

262
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,710
Then, Yuzo...

263
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:54,210
stick the head of the doll, you have, out the window.

264
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,610
Sure.

265
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:02,810
That's it. Just like how Nobukazu looked out the window.

266
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:07,310
Robert confirmed the situation

267
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:10,110
and then moved the car off.

268
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,710
The string tied to the car is pulled.

269
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:20,210
The thumbtacks come loose as the rope choked Nobukazu,

270
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,410
it pulled in the opposite direction

271
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:26,210
and the back of Nobukazu's head bangs into the beam.

272
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,810
The string is pulled more and it snaps.

273
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:33,410
Nobukazu's body dives into a sea of strings

274
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:39,810
and dangles from the ceiling as if tangled in a spider's threads.

275
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:44,010
The question is... Robert.

276
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,510
How did you know that

277
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:50,310
Nobukazu's body was tangled in strings?

278
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,110
The only ones among you who knew about it

279
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,010
were the four who came to the scene of the crime,

280
00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:01,210
Ryuji, Yuzo, Chie and Miyuki.

281
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,110
Of course, these four

282
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,910
were told not to tell anyone about the scene of the crime.

283
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,810
And, one more person.

284
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,710
In other words, that's...

285
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:19,210
the murderer who rigged the set-up to kill Nobukazu!

286
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:29,210
Robert.

287
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,510
How...

288
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,710
How did you know?

289
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,910
It sounds funny.

290
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,610
You kept everyone from talking

291
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,410
and waited for me to make the slip.

292
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,610
The number of fish.

293
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,710
The fish for dinner.

294
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,910
The unexpected guests

295
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,710
were suppose to be me, Kazuha, and you, three people

296
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,710
but she was short only two fishes.

297
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,210
That means you were an expected guest

298
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,810
that somebody had already invited from the very beginning.

299
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,710
At first, I thought you and Yuko, who bought the fish,

300
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,110
were suspicious

301
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,510
but hearing that, Nobukazu handled all the money,

302
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,710
the only suspicious one left was you.

303
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,810
I sensed something was going to happen.

304
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,110
Nothing had happened yet,

305
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,610
so I let Kazuha go to visit the grave with you

306
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,910
but Nobukazu was murdered and I panicked.

307
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,810
If you were the murderer,

308
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:24,610
you might have run off with Kazuha and Ran.

309
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,810
You dangled Kazuha in the strings on the 1st floor of the storehouse

310
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,710
but didn't kill her to make it look like a curse

311
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,410
and to create an illusion to make us think that

312
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:40,010
there may be a way to escape from this room.

313
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:45,710
Of course, there's also the reason that Kazuha found the BB shots.

314
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:51,310
But, why? Why even Mr. Negishi?

315
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:57,410
Several days ago, when I came by here, he said this.

316
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:02,010
If it's Misa, she committed suicide after you left.

317
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,910
Nobukazu was picking on her anyway.

318
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:10,010
Well, it can't be helped, she wasn't his real daughter.

319
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:14,310
A girl like that, nobody would marry her anyway.

320
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:18,610
There'd be nothing good even if she were living.

321
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,410
With eyes that were high on drugs,

322
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:26,310
he laughed and told me that.

323
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:29,510
I desperately learned to read and write Japanese

324
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,310
because she wasn't good at English.

325
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,710
I finally was able to come and meet her.

326
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:42,310
I looked forward to seeing her smiling face...

327
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:47,610
But, wasn't it overdoing it to put Kazuha in that situation?

328
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,110
I didn't care who got hurt, or who was suspicious of me!

329
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:53,010
I didn't care what happened anymore!

330
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,810
To everyone in his household who let her die!

331
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,110
Hey, I thought of not telling you,

332
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,910
but I'll tell you something.

333
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,310
When Misa was in an unstable state of mind,

334
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:09,010
when she was conversing with you in Roman-Japanese...

335
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,910
Stop! Hattori!

336
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,210
The real reason why she committed suicide was...

337
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,710
Maybe... just maybe...

338
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,310
Shine?

339
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,010
That's right.

340
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,810
"S.h.i.n.e" is shine.

341
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,910
It means to be bright.

342
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:34,010
Maybe for Robert, Misa was a bright light.

343
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,410
Light?

344
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,510
Come to think of it, Robert said

345
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:40,210
he wanted a bride that was like a light.

346
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,810
We've got to apologize to Robert.

347
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,010
Apologize?

348
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,810
But it was the same as the letters from Uncle Negishi's name,

349
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:51,310
so we thought Robert wrote a terrible thing

350
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,510
and gave it to Misa.

351
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,410
We thought he wrote "Die".

352
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,610
Morning came

353
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:19,310
and Robert was taken off by the Tottori Prefectural police.

354
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,910
In the patrol car,

355
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:26,110
Robert repeated the same words over and over again.

356
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:31,210
Why wasn't he Japanese?

357
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:35,210
Why isn't she American?

358
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:42,710
Like a broken puppet, he repeated over and over again.

359
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:16,810
Why did Robert go off with the police?

360
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,610
Why? Why?

361
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,310
But, the murderer is the Spider Empress.

362
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,010
We saw it. Before we went to take a bath,

363
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:26,110
we saw that long spider's thread coming out

364
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,610
from the storehouse window.

365
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,010
If it's that, it's probably...

366
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,510
Never mind.

367
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,910
It's the doing of the Spider Empress.

368
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,810
Robert jus went back to his country.

369
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:41,610
You don't have to worry about it.

370
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:43,910
-You're right. -You're right.

371
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:47,410
Grandmother, tell us a story again.

372
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:51,410
Then how about "The White Rabbit of Inaba"?

373
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:54,010
We've heard that out before.

374
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,510
It's grandma, after all.

375
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,410
How beautiful.

376
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,410
What's that?

377
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,310
Drowning?

378
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,810
In other words, due to some sort of accident,

379
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:21,510
she wasn't able to escape from the shell.

380
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:24,110
No. This isn't an accident.

381
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,110
It's a planned murder.

382
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,310
Next Conan,

383
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:32,130
"The Kiss of Venus"

384
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:35,330
Next Conan's Hint:

385
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,330
"Cosmetics"

386
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:40,230
-The next episode... -is a beautiful and frightening...

387
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,730
case.
