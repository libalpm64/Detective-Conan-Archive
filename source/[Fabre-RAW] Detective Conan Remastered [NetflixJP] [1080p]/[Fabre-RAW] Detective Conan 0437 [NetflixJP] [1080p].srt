Investigation with Aya Ueto!

4
00:00:07,397 --> 00:00:08,797
The promise Shinichi made with her

5
00:00:08,797 --> 00:00:10,497
is recollected along with an old lady's sad memory.

Yeah! It was Suwa and Kobayashi.

You're the guy in the tennis club.

Hey!

00:02:11,902 --> 00:02:13,402
Kitada!

18
00:02:13,402 --> 00:02:15,302

Deduction is all about formula.

23
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:37,702
As long as I applied the right formula,

24
00:02:37,702 --> 00:02:39,602
I can find the answer.

You know, I knew you were the one.

It's a beautiful spring day today.

32
00:03:39,902 --> 00:03:44,102
And a young, pretty girls like us are dusting.

33
00:03:44,102 --> 00:03:46,202
She is evil!

34
00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:48,202
Because your mother-in-law makes you clean her house

35
00:03:48,202 --> 00:03:51,802
while she's out for something! She is evil. She is!

36
00:03:51,802 --> 00:03:52,902
Oh, god.

37
00:03:52,902 --> 00:03:56,102
Please, you gotta stop talking about the wife and-mother-in-law thing!

38
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:58,002
I'm doing this because I wanted to do.

39
00:03:58,002 --> 00:04:00,902
And also I never asked you to do it either!

40
00:04:00,902 --> 00:04:04,002
Well, yeah.

41
00:04:04,002 --> 00:04:06,802
Anyway, look at them.

42
00:04:06,802 --> 00:04:09,002
They're all books!

43
00:04:14,502 --> 00:04:17,302
It's "The Dark Baron: Night Baron"

44
00:04:17,302 --> 00:04:20,902

"Female High School Detective Yuki's Casebook"

46
00:04:23,602 --> 00:04:26,202
It's "Female High School Detective Yuki's Casebook".

"TV Drama, appearance: Aya Ueto" -I think...

48
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:30,802
It was on TV before, right?

49
00:04:30,802 --> 00:04:33,002
Yeah, I know! It was a two-hour drama!

50
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:35,702
It's my dad's work in his early years.

51
00:04:35,702 --> 00:04:38,302
It's kinda cheesy, especially if I read it now.

52
00:04:41,002 --> 00:04:42,002
Look.

53
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:45,802
-Isn't she Aya Ueto? -Oh, that.

54
00:04:45,802 --> 00:04:48,502
She and her manager actually came to talk with Shinichi's parents

55
00:04:48,502 --> 00:04:51,402
because she was going to be starring for the first time.

56
00:04:51,402 --> 00:04:54,302
Yeah, I think you told me that before.

57
00:04:54,302 --> 00:04:56,202
When was it?

58
00:04:56,202 --> 00:05:00,202
That was when I was 13 years old, so it was 4 years ago.

59
00:05:00,202 --> 00:05:02,602
I was a fan of hers of Aya,

60
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:03,902
and Shinichi told me that she's coming to his house,

61
00:05:03,902 --> 00:05:06,802
So I went up to Shinichi's house to get her autograph.

62
00:05:06,802 --> 00:05:09,802
But Shinichi wasn't paying attention to her really.

63
00:05:09,802 --> 00:05:12,702
He was actually playing with a soccer ball.

64
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:14,702
And I remember that

65
00:05:14,702 --> 00:05:19,402
she had a serious look on her face when she looked at him.

66
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:23,102
So, I asked him what they were talking about.

67
00:05:23,102 --> 00:05:24,202
And he said?

68
00:05:24,202 --> 00:05:26,002
Nothing.

69
00:05:26,002 --> 00:05:29,402
But, I'm kinda curious about what they were talking about.

70
00:05:29,402 --> 00:05:30,702
Shinichi.

71
00:05:32,502 --> 00:05:36,302
Maybe he was asking her out?

72
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:38,102
Sonoko! You!

73
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:40,002
How is that possible?

74
00:05:41,802 --> 00:05:43,902
-Somebody's here! -Yeah.

75
00:05:43,902 --> 00:05:44,902
"Kudo" -Yes?

76
00:05:44,902 --> 00:05:48,402
Is Mr. Shinichi Kudo there?

77
00:05:48,402 --> 00:05:49,802
Me?

78
00:05:49,802 --> 00:05:51,702
A young girl?

79
00:05:51,702 --> 00:05:53,702
Shinichi is not home right now.

80
00:05:53,702 --> 00:05:55,902
Excuse me, who is this?

81
00:05:57,002 --> 00:05:58,702
A young girl, huh?

82
00:06:01,702 --> 00:06:04,802
My name is Ueto...

83
00:06:04,802 --> 00:06:06,402
I'm Aya Ueto!

84
00:06:06,402 --> 00:06:07,702
What?

85
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:10,002
Aya Ueto?

86
00:06:21,102 --> 00:06:22,302
It's for real!

87
00:06:22,302 --> 00:06:24,702
It's really Aya Ueto!

88
00:06:28,602 --> 00:06:31,302
Do you remember me?

89
00:06:31,302 --> 00:06:34,102
Yes, you are Ran Mouri.

90
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,602
You are Shinichi's friend from childhood, right?

91
00:06:36,602 --> 00:06:38,702
Yeah!

92
00:06:38,702 --> 00:06:39,902
She is my friend...

93
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:41,602
I'm Sonoko Suzuki!

94
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:43,502
Nice to meet you!

95
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:44,602
Nice to meet you too!

96
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:46,502
And he is Conan.

97
00:06:46,502 --> 00:06:48,702
-Hi, there! -Hello.

98
00:06:48,702 --> 00:06:51,302
Look. Somebody is getting shy!

99
00:06:51,302 --> 00:06:52,902
Shut up!

100
00:06:52,902 --> 00:06:55,302
So, when is Shinichi coming back?

101
00:06:55,302 --> 00:06:56,902
We don't know that actually.

102
00:06:56,902 --> 00:06:58,902
He never came back since he left for the investigation of a criminal case.

103
00:06:58,902 --> 00:07:02,002
You came here to see Shinichi?

104
00:07:02,002 --> 00:07:04,202
Is it about some investigation?

105
00:07:04,202 --> 00:07:07,902
Yes, indeed. Is it possible for you to call him?

106
00:07:07,902 --> 00:07:12,202
Well, it's always the answering machine when we call him.

107
00:07:12,202 --> 00:07:14,102
But let me give a try.

108
00:07:14,102 --> 00:07:15,802
Thank you.

109
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,702
He's not gonna answer because I'm here.

110
00:07:18,702 --> 00:07:21,402
Hey! If it's about an investigation, why don't you ask Kogoro Mouri?

111
00:07:21,402 --> 00:07:24,102
I don't think you should!

112
00:07:24,102 --> 00:07:27,902
-Why not? -Because he has been having a major hangover this morning!

113
00:07:27,902 --> 00:07:29,302
Man, he's helpless.

114
00:07:29,302 --> 00:07:32,102
It's the answering machine again.

115
00:07:32,102 --> 00:07:33,602
Is that so?

116
00:07:33,602 --> 00:07:34,802
Then, what should I do?

117
00:07:34,802 --> 00:07:37,602
Why don't you leave him a message?

118
00:07:37,602 --> 00:07:41,002
Shinichi might call you back later. You never know, right?

119
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,502
You're right. Would you like to tell us what happened?

120
00:07:44,502 --> 00:07:46,102
Okay.

121
00:07:47,002 --> 00:07:50,102
There is an old lady named Fumie Koda in my neighborhood.

122
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:53,502
She's 80 years old and living alone.

123
00:07:53,502 --> 00:07:56,102
She's actually a good friend of mine,

124
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:59,102
so I often go to her house on my day off.

125
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:01,902
And just like always, I went to her house this noon.

126
00:08:01,902 --> 00:08:05,202
Grandma! It's Aya! I'm coming in.

127
00:08:05,202 --> 00:08:06,502
Grandma?

128
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:08,502
I'm came to visit.

129
00:08:08,502 --> 00:08:10,102
Grandma?

130
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,102
It's weird.

131
00:08:15,102 --> 00:08:17,202
Where did she go?

132
00:08:17,902 --> 00:08:22,402
She often leaves her house without locking the door,

133
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:24,202
and I thought she did it again.

134
00:08:24,202 --> 00:08:26,602
So I waited for her a while, but...

135
00:08:26,602 --> 00:08:28,502
But she didn't come back?

136
00:08:28,502 --> 00:08:31,102
Right. I started worrying about her

137
00:08:31,102 --> 00:08:33,502
So I went to a grocery store near the house.

138
00:08:33,502 --> 00:08:34,602
And asked...

139
00:08:34,602 --> 00:08:37,802
She just passed by a while ago.

140
00:08:37,802 --> 00:08:39,302
So I asked her where she was going.

141
00:08:39,302 --> 00:08:41,102
She said she's going to Beika-cho.

142
00:08:41,102 --> 00:08:42,202
Beika-cho?

143
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:45,302
Yeah. She answered me and just left!

144
00:08:45,302 --> 00:08:46,702
She had this serious look on her face

145
00:08:46,702 --> 00:08:48,302
and she was acting strange as well.

146
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:50,902
I was kind of worried about her.

147
00:08:50,902 --> 00:08:54,802
I was worried so I came to Beika-cho by taxi.

148
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:58,102
But I don't know why Grandma came to this town,

149
00:08:58,102 --> 00:09:00,102
so I have no clue where to look for her.

150
00:09:00,102 --> 00:09:03,802
Suddenly, I remembered about Shinichi.

151
00:09:03,802 --> 00:09:07,802
It was 4 years ago when I met him.

152
00:09:07,802 --> 00:09:10,702
And I just remembered, now he's a famous high school detective,

153
00:09:10,702 --> 00:09:13,102
and he's also living in this town...

154
00:09:13,102 --> 00:09:15,702
-That's why you visited here, right? -Right.

155
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:18,202
Also, he and I had a...

156
00:09:18,202 --> 00:09:19,202
What?

157
00:09:20,202 --> 00:09:22,802
No, it's nothing.

158
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:27,102
Do you know if she has a friend in Beika-cho?

159
00:09:27,102 --> 00:09:28,702
No, I don't know.

160
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,902
Well then, I'll send a text message to Shinichi's cell-phone

161
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:33,302
about what happened today, just in case, okay?

162
00:09:33,302 --> 00:09:36,102
What else do you know about this old lady?

163
00:09:36,102 --> 00:09:37,202
What?

164
00:09:38,402 --> 00:09:40,702
The more information you have, the closer you get to solving the case.

165
00:09:40,702 --> 00:09:44,202
Shinichi used to say that.

166
00:09:44,202 --> 00:09:46,602
Okay. What else...

167
00:09:46,602 --> 00:09:50,602
Grandma lost her daughter who fell ill when she was young, I heard.

168
00:09:50,602 --> 00:09:52,302
Lost her daughter?

169
00:09:52,302 --> 00:09:57,702
It was half a year ago, that I heard about it from Grandma's best friend.

170
00:09:57,702 --> 00:10:00,802
It was when Fumie was 40 years old, I remember.

171
00:10:00,802 --> 00:10:04,402
She had a sick daughter, Ayako, who was only 17 years old.

172
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:09,202
Fumie was a single mother, so she worked and raised Ayako.

173
00:10:09,202 --> 00:10:13,502
That day also, she was working from morning.

174
00:10:13,502 --> 00:10:17,802
While she was away, Ayako's condition turned bad suddenly.

175
00:10:17,802 --> 00:10:20,402
By the time Fumie got to the hospital room,

176
00:10:20,402 --> 00:10:22,102
Ayako was already...

177
00:10:22,102 --> 00:10:25,402
Fumie regretted the fact that she couldn't be with her daughter

178
00:10:25,402 --> 00:10:27,002
at the moment of her death.

179
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:31,302
"Ayako Koda" -She blames herself for Ayako's death, I think.

180
00:10:31,302 --> 00:10:33,002
I never knew that.

181
00:10:33,002 --> 00:10:35,902
You know, Fumie never talks about this to anyone.

182
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:40,102
Actually, you look like Ayako somehow.

183
00:10:40,102 --> 00:10:41,902
The name is similar too.

184
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:45,502
That must be why she took a special liking to you.

185
00:10:45,502 --> 00:10:46,702
I'm home!

186
00:10:46,702 --> 00:10:49,802
Sorry, it took me long. There were so many things to buy!

187
00:10:49,802 --> 00:10:50,902
Welcome back!

188
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:52,702
Gotta keep it a secret, okay?

189
00:10:52,702 --> 00:10:54,902
Okay.

190
00:10:54,902 --> 00:10:58,302
Grandma was always smiling.

191
00:10:58,302 --> 00:11:02,002
I never knew she went through so much before.

192
00:11:02,002 --> 00:11:05,602
She was 17 years old, that's around our age.

193
00:11:05,602 --> 00:11:08,002
It must have been hard for the old lady.

194
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:09,602
And as well as for her daughter.

195
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,902
If I remember correctly, her daughter loved classical music,

196
00:11:11,902 --> 00:11:15,002
especially Mozart.

197
00:11:15,002 --> 00:11:18,302
I'm not sure whether this old lady's daughter

198
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,602
has something to do with this case.

199
00:11:20,602 --> 00:11:23,002
Maybe we need to see this case from a different angle.

200
00:11:23,002 --> 00:11:26,102
The main power of the TV was on

201
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,502
when you went in to the living room, right?

202
00:11:28,502 --> 00:11:31,702
You think Grandma was watching TV until she left the house?

203
00:11:31,702 --> 00:11:33,202
Yes, I think so,

204
00:11:33,202 --> 00:11:35,902
because the TV schedule in the newspaper was left open.

205
00:11:35,902 --> 00:11:38,802
Was the tea left unfinished?

206
00:11:38,802 --> 00:11:41,302
Then, maybe Grandma was impelled by some kind of sudden thought

207
00:11:41,302 --> 00:11:43,902
while watching TV, and then left the house.

208
00:11:43,902 --> 00:11:46,302
Do you know which channel it was?

209
00:11:46,302 --> 00:11:47,702
Actually, I do know.

210
00:11:47,702 --> 00:11:50,002
While I was waiting for Grandma...

211
00:11:52,202 --> 00:11:53,502
Nichiuri TV.

212
00:11:54,502 --> 00:11:57,402
Nichiuri TV. It was Nichiuri TV, right?

213
00:11:57,402 --> 00:11:59,102
-Yes. -Conan?

214
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:03,102
I was just trying to find out which TV show she was watching.

215
00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:05,902
You know, there's no newspaper in Shinichi's house.

216
00:12:05,902 --> 00:12:08,102
So you're gonna call someone and ask, right?

217
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,502
-No! -What do you mean no?

218
00:12:10,502 --> 00:12:13,102
What? You even can do it?

219
00:12:13,102 --> 00:12:15,702
"Female High School Detective Yuki's Casebook (Rerun)"

220
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:18,402
Hey! That's what we were talking about a while ago!

221
00:12:19,202 --> 00:12:23,002
Is this TV drama, "Female High School Detective Yuki's Casebook"?

222
00:12:23,002 --> 00:12:25,002
They're airing a rerun of it.

223
00:12:25,002 --> 00:12:27,602
-Yeah, you're right! -I didn't know that.

224
00:12:27,602 --> 00:12:30,902
The main actor of the TV show didn't know that it was on TV?

225
00:12:30,902 --> 00:12:32,102
Wait a sec.

226
00:12:32,102 --> 00:12:35,202
I think the shooting of this TV drama was in Beika-cho.

227
00:12:35,202 --> 00:12:38,102
Yeah. It was at Beika Station, Beika Park

228
00:12:38,102 --> 00:12:40,102
and Shunichi Shitara Memorial House also.

229
00:12:40,102 --> 00:12:42,402
Yeah! It was the one in the old western mansion, wasn't it?

230
00:12:42,402 --> 00:12:43,602
Yes.

231
00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:46,602
It was a musician's house 10 years ago, but since he passed away,

232
00:12:46,602 --> 00:12:47,702
his wife who was also a pianist

233
00:12:47,702 --> 00:12:50,202
made it the memorial house of her husband.

234
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:53,002
Aya, in that episode, you were attacked by the murderer,

235
00:12:53,002 --> 00:12:56,102
and got locked in the basement in the mansion, right?

236
00:12:56,102 --> 00:12:57,102
That's right!

237
00:12:57,102 --> 00:12:59,402
But we only used the exterior of the mansion.

238
00:12:59,402 --> 00:13:01,202
We actually used the set when we were shooting inside.

239
00:13:01,202 --> 00:13:02,302
You did?

240
00:13:02,302 --> 00:13:03,602
I got it!

241
00:13:04,502 --> 00:13:07,402
I think I know why Grandma came to Beika-cho!

242
00:13:07,402 --> 00:13:09,102
-Yeah? -Are you serious, Sonoko?

243
00:13:09,102 --> 00:13:13,602
Yeah. The female high school detective Sonoko Suzuki's deduction is...

244
00:13:17,602 --> 00:13:19,502
Always right!

245
00:13:21,502 --> 00:13:23,602
Is she all right?

246
00:13:29,228 --> 00:13:30,228
Okay, listen.

247
00:13:30,228 --> 00:13:32,828
I think Grandma could not distinguish between

248
00:13:32,828 --> 00:13:34,228
TV drama and reality.

249
00:13:34,228 --> 00:13:36,128
-What? -What do you mean?

250
00:13:36,128 --> 00:13:39,428
Perhaps, when she was looking at the TV listing in the newspaper,

251
00:13:39,428 --> 00:13:41,228
she found Aya's name.

252
00:13:41,228 --> 00:13:43,428
So she watched this TV drama, from the beginning of the show.

253
00:13:43,428 --> 00:13:44,528
"Female High School Detective Yuki's Casebook"

254
00:13:44,528 --> 00:13:48,128
However, she fell asleep in the middle of the show.

255
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:52,028
And then, when she woke up as the show approached the end.

256
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:54,528
On TV, Aya was being attacked by someone,

257
00:13:54,528 --> 00:13:57,328
and got locked up in the basement of the mansion.

258
00:13:57,328 --> 00:14:00,428
Because she just woke up, her brain wasn't functioning properly,

259
00:14:00,428 --> 00:14:02,428
and she thought that it was happening for real.

260
00:14:02,428 --> 00:14:06,028
Thus, she rushed out of her house, to save Aya.

261
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:09,528
That's why she came to Beika-cho!

262
00:14:09,528 --> 00:14:13,028
Well, if so, then she wouldn't turn off the TV, would she?

263
00:14:13,028 --> 00:14:15,328
-What? -It's clear that she turned off the TV.

264
00:14:15,328 --> 00:14:18,228
That means, she knew that it was a TV program...

265
00:14:18,228 --> 00:14:21,328
Shut up! Such a minor thing doesn't matter!

266
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:22,528
Here!

267
00:14:25,028 --> 00:14:27,728
Anyway, Grandma should be in the memorial house.

268
00:14:27,728 --> 00:14:28,828
She must be!

269
00:14:28,828 --> 00:14:30,528
What do you think, Aya?

270
00:14:31,928 --> 00:14:35,128
Man, only Sonoko can make a deduction like that.

271
00:14:35,128 --> 00:14:38,928
But in fact, it is true that the old lady was watching the drama.

272
00:14:38,928 --> 00:14:40,528
The reason she came to Beika-cho

273
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:42,928
should have something with the TV drama.

274
00:14:42,928 --> 00:14:44,628
What was she going to do?

275
00:14:44,628 --> 00:14:46,428
Guys, we should head down to the memorial house,

276
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:48,528
rather than stay here thinking!

277
00:14:48,528 --> 00:14:50,228
That's right, let's go.

278
00:14:51,728 --> 00:14:54,728
Yes, this old lady came here a while ago.

279
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,428
See? My deduction was right!

280
00:14:57,428 --> 00:14:59,028
So, she's still inside?

281
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:02,828
No. She left here about 10 minutes ago.

282
00:15:02,828 --> 00:15:05,128
-She left? -We just missed her.

283
00:15:05,128 --> 00:15:09,128
Maybe she went out to look for you Aya because you weren't here.

284
00:15:09,128 --> 00:15:11,528
Do you remember how did granny look?

285
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:13,128
Right when she came,

286
00:15:13,128 --> 00:15:16,328
she was looking up at the window of the 2nd floor for a while.

287
00:15:16,328 --> 00:15:20,528
And then she said to me "May I come in?", so I said "yes".

288
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:23,428
It doesn't sound like she came here to save Aya.

289
00:15:23,428 --> 00:15:24,928
Then, what was it?

290
00:15:24,928 --> 00:15:29,428
She left here 10 minutes ago, so she may be around here still!

291
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,328
Do you know which way she went?

292
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:32,728
Yes, she went that way.

293
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:34,128
I'll go and look for her!

294
00:15:34,128 --> 00:15:36,228
Wait! We should go with her!

295
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:37,728
Yeah!

296
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,128
How did she look when she left here?

297
00:15:40,128 --> 00:15:43,928
Actually, she looked as if she saw something unbelievable.

298
00:15:43,928 --> 00:15:46,928
I talked to her but she didn't respond and just left.

299
00:15:46,928 --> 00:15:47,928
Thank you!

300
00:15:51,328 --> 00:15:52,928
Wait a sec.

301
00:15:52,928 --> 00:15:56,128
Maybe there's some clue left in this house.

302
00:15:56,128 --> 00:15:57,528
May I go in?

303
00:15:57,528 --> 00:15:58,928
Sure.

304
00:15:59,528 --> 00:16:01,728
"Music Room"

305
00:16:17,128 --> 00:16:18,328
That's...

306
00:16:18,328 --> 00:16:20,528
the old ward of Beika Hospital.

307
00:16:21,928 --> 00:16:25,428
Her daughter loved classical music, especially Mozart.

308
00:16:25,428 --> 00:16:26,828
Maybe...

309
00:16:41,028 --> 00:16:43,128
Ayako, I'm sorry.

310
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,428
I'll be there soon.

311
00:16:50,028 --> 00:16:51,228
It's no good!

312
00:16:53,928 --> 00:16:56,328
Granny! Granny!

313
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:01,328
Darn!

314
00:17:06,028 --> 00:17:08,628
Maybe Fumie is on her way home.

315
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:09,728
Yeah.

316
00:17:11,428 --> 00:17:13,828
It's Shinichi!

317
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:15,228
-Hello? -Ran!

318
00:17:15,228 --> 00:17:16,928
I got your message. Where are you right now?

319
00:17:16,928 --> 00:17:19,128
I'm right in front of the Shitara Memorial House.

320
00:17:19,128 --> 00:17:22,328
Okay, you need to ask Mrs. Shitara to play Mozart right now, got that?

321
00:17:22,328 --> 00:17:23,628
Mozart?

322
00:17:23,628 --> 00:17:25,928
-Yeah! You need to hurry! -I'll go!

323
00:17:25,928 --> 00:17:27,128
Sonoko just went...

324
00:17:27,128 --> 00:17:28,428
Okay, now I need to talk to Aya!

325
00:17:28,428 --> 00:17:29,728
What?

326
00:17:29,728 --> 00:17:31,228
It's Shinichi.

327
00:17:31,228 --> 00:17:33,928
Excuse me. Hello, it's Aya.

328
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:38,728
Aya, Fumie is right now in front of the old ward of Beika Hospital!

329
00:17:38,728 --> 00:17:39,828
Beika Hospital?

330
00:17:39,828 --> 00:17:41,228
You need to go there!

331
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:43,928
Fumie is trying to kill herself!

332
00:17:51,628 --> 00:17:53,628
You have to make it, please!

333
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:20,128
Aya, the Beika Hospital was where Fumie's daughter

334
00:18:20,128 --> 00:18:22,328
was staying at before she died.

335
00:18:22,328 --> 00:18:25,128
Perhaps, she heard Mozart

336
00:18:25,128 --> 00:18:28,728
that Mr. Shitara was playing in his house.

337
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:32,028
And that melody was the only thing that could ease Ayako's mind.

338
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,628
Fumie used to see Shitara's residence from the window of the Ayako's ward.

339
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:37,228
And it was the same scene that she saw on the TV drama today.

340
00:18:38,828 --> 00:18:41,728
Fumie was surprised and panicked.

341
00:18:41,728 --> 00:18:44,728
So she got out of her house and headed to Beika-cho.

342
00:18:44,728 --> 00:18:47,728
And there, she saw the old ward of Beika Hospital

343
00:18:47,728 --> 00:18:50,028
from the Shitara Memorial House.

344
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:54,028
Perhaps, she couldn't believe what she actually saw there.

345
00:18:54,028 --> 00:18:58,028
Because the hospital ward had been kept just like it used to be.

346
00:18:58,028 --> 00:18:59,828
This way!

347
00:18:59,828 --> 00:19:02,528
Fumie left the memorial house and headed to the old hospital.

348
00:19:02,528 --> 00:19:05,228
As she stood in front of the old hospital ward,

349
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:09,228
the painful past of having lost her daughter came back to her.

350
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:12,628
She thinks that it was her fault that Ayako died.

351
00:19:12,628 --> 00:19:16,328
And now, she is trying to die, to see her daughter in heaven.

352
00:19:17,528 --> 00:19:19,628
There is only one person who can stop her.

353
00:19:19,628 --> 00:19:21,228
Aya, it is you!

354
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:22,628
Only me?

355
00:19:27,628 --> 00:19:29,028
Grandma!

356
00:19:35,028 --> 00:19:36,428
Ayako?

357
00:19:37,428 --> 00:19:39,928
There is only one person who can stop her.

358
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,828
Aya, it is you!

359
00:19:43,828 --> 00:19:49,128
Mom, I lived only 17 years, but I was happy.

360
00:19:49,128 --> 00:19:50,228
What?

361
00:19:50,228 --> 00:19:54,728
I was really happy because you were my mom.

362
00:19:54,728 --> 00:19:57,328
I just wanted to tell you that.

363
00:19:57,328 --> 00:19:58,828
Ayako.

364
00:19:58,828 --> 00:20:01,628
So, please don't die now, Mom.

365
00:20:01,628 --> 00:20:04,128
You have to live for me, please.

366
00:20:06,028 --> 00:20:07,328
Okay.

367
00:20:07,328 --> 00:20:10,728
I will, Ayako. Thank you.

368
00:20:13,628 --> 00:20:15,928
Grandma!

369
00:20:15,928 --> 00:20:17,328
Aya?

370
00:20:17,328 --> 00:20:19,728
Grandma.

371
00:20:19,728 --> 00:20:22,628
Ayako came here to see me, just now.

372
00:20:22,628 --> 00:20:27,528
She came and forgave me.

373
00:20:27,528 --> 00:20:30,228
That's good, Grandma.

374
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:31,728
That's good.

375
00:20:32,428 --> 00:20:33,728
Ran!

376
00:20:34,528 --> 00:20:36,328
You found her.

377
00:20:40,328 --> 00:20:41,628
Shinichi,

378
00:20:41,628 --> 00:20:45,528
I think I fulfilled the promise that we made 4 years ago.

379
00:20:45,528 --> 00:20:49,328
Yeah. I think I fulfilled my promise as well.

380
00:20:49,328 --> 00:20:51,428
You are good at soccer.

381
00:20:51,428 --> 00:20:53,128
You are gonna be a soccer player?

382
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:54,628
No, I will be a detective.

383
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,728
Detective?

384
00:20:55,728 --> 00:20:57,628
Like Holmes.

385
00:20:57,628 --> 00:20:59,328
You mean Sherlock Holmes?

386
00:20:59,328 --> 00:21:01,928
Yeah, but a high school detective, before that.

387
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,528
It's not nothing like childish play.

388
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,328
A real detective's what I'm gonna be.

389
00:21:07,528 --> 00:21:09,128
Do you wanna make a promise?

390
00:21:09,128 --> 00:21:12,928
Next time we see each other, maybe 4 or 5 years later.

391
00:21:12,928 --> 00:21:15,228
I will be a real actress,

392
00:21:15,228 --> 00:21:17,828
and you will be a real detective.

393
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:21,928
Yeah, sure thing.

394
00:21:21,928 --> 00:21:24,728
Anyway, how did you grasp the situation only by the text message?

395
00:21:24,728 --> 00:21:26,728
Well, deduction is about formula.

396
00:21:26,728 --> 00:21:29,928
I get the answer as long as I applied the right formula.

397
00:21:31,128 --> 00:21:32,228
All right, take care.

398
00:21:32,228 --> 00:21:34,228
Yeah, you too.

399
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,128
Ran!

400
00:21:38,128 --> 00:21:39,428
Conan!

401
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:41,228
No wonder it took forever to find you guys!

402
00:21:41,228 --> 00:21:43,628
Hey, you found the granny.

403
00:21:43,628 --> 00:21:46,628
Kid, what are you doing there?

404
00:21:47,428 --> 00:21:49,428
You can't come up here, can you?

405
00:21:49,428 --> 00:21:51,028
It's so funny.

406
00:21:52,328 --> 00:21:54,028
You!

407
00:21:54,028 --> 00:21:56,728
Ran, Sonoko, thank you.

408
00:21:56,728 --> 00:21:58,528
And you too, Conan. Thank you!

409
00:21:58,528 --> 00:22:00,528
You're welcome!

410
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,728
Now, Grandma, shall we go home?

411
00:22:02,728 --> 00:22:03,728
Okay.

412
00:22:03,728 --> 00:22:04,828
Here.

413
00:22:04,828 --> 00:22:06,828
Come and see us anytime.

414
00:22:06,828 --> 00:22:07,828
Yes.

415
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:09,128
-Good bye. -Good bye.

416
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:12,028
Conan! Take care!

417
00:22:12,028 --> 00:22:13,828
Bye-bye!

418
00:22:14,628 --> 00:22:16,828
It was fantastic acting!

419
00:23:42,828 --> 00:23:45,528
So the case ended happily.

420
00:23:45,528 --> 00:23:47,628
But ever since that day...

421
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,928
God, not again.

422
00:23:51,928 --> 00:23:55,828
What was that promise you guys made 4 years ago? Tell me, Shinichi!

423
00:23:55,828 --> 00:23:59,628
There will be no call to Ran for a while.

424
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,260
Next Conan's Hint:

425
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,140
"Three fish"
