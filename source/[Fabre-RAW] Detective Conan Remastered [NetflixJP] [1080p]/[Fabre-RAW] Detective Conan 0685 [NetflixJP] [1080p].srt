1
00:00:02,227 --> 00:00:04,427
In order to catch up with the members of the Youth Detective Squad

2
00:00:04,427 --> 00:00:06,427
who went before us by bus,

3
00:00:06,427 --> 00:00:10,427
Ai and I were given a lift on Subaru's car.

4
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:13,993
We ran into Officer Takagi on the way, I stopped to talk to him when...

5
00:00:14,227 --> 00:00:15,727
He fell!

6
00:00:15,727 --> 00:00:16,827
Somebody fell!

7
00:00:16,827 --> 00:00:17,997
Let's go to the site.

8
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:20,027
Come on, hurry.

9
00:00:20,027 --> 00:00:21,427
When we get to the site,

10
00:00:21,427 --> 00:00:25,027
we see the body that had fallen from the top floor of the condo.

11
00:00:25,027 --> 00:00:29,327
Since three people who knew the man who fell were near the site,

12
00:00:29,327 --> 00:00:31,327
we visited the rooms of each of these people

13
00:00:31,327 --> 00:00:33,527
to ask them some questions but...

14
00:00:33,527 --> 00:00:35,727
How about this?

15
00:00:35,727 --> 00:00:38,927
There's still this much beer foam left here.

16
00:00:38,927 --> 00:00:40,327
It's because I was drinking beer

17
00:00:40,327 --> 00:00:42,021
and watching TV till just a while ago.

18
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:44,023
I see.

19
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:46,627
This coffee?

20
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:51,227
That's the coffee I was drinking before I left the room.

21
00:00:51,227 --> 00:00:54,327
I can't start my day without my morning coffee.

22
00:00:54,327 --> 00:00:57,427
Then, this will for the time being, serve as proof.

23
00:00:57,427 --> 00:01:00,727
There still some steam rising from it too.

24
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,327
Hurry and look officer!

25
00:01:02,327 --> 00:01:04,043
Please calm down.

26
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:07,427
After I heard about the steam of Ms. Tsukihara's coffee a while ago,

27
00:01:07,427 --> 00:01:09,027
I happened to remember.

28
00:01:11,527 --> 00:01:14,053
No good. They're all snuffed out.

29
00:01:14,227 --> 00:01:17,727
I left the cigarette standing in the ashtray when I left the room,

30
00:01:17,727 --> 00:01:21,327
so I thought it'd still be lit, but...

31
00:01:21,327 --> 00:01:22,827
Please look, see.

32
00:01:22,827 --> 00:01:25,127
The smoke's still rising, isn't it?

33
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:28,527
This is proof that I was here till just a while ago.

34
00:01:28,527 --> 00:01:31,727
The things that will serve as proof of the alibis are...

35
00:01:31,727 --> 00:01:36,075
foam, steam, and smoke.

36
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:38,077
Inspector Megure.

37
00:01:38,327 --> 00:01:42,081
Why don't we experiment while we're at it?

38
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:43,427
Experiment?

39
00:01:43,427 --> 00:01:46,827
Yes, an experiment with foam, steam, and smoke.

40
00:01:47,827 --> 00:01:49,527
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

41
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:51,427
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

42
00:01:51,427 --> 00:01:53,527
A perfect trick that erased all traces.

43
00:01:53,527 --> 00:01:55,527
The experiment proves false alibi.

44
00:01:55,527 --> 00:01:57,227
He sees through the one and only truth.

45
00:01:57,227 --> 00:01:59,427
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

46
00:01:59,427 --> 00:02:01,727
His name is Detective Conan!

47
00:03:43,904 --> 00:03:48,904
"Foam, Steam, and Smoke (Part 2)"

48
00:03:49,504 --> 00:03:52,604
Well, just as Conan said...

49
00:03:52,604 --> 00:03:54,213
If the room temperature is low,

50
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:56,604
I think that steam would hold longer but...

51
00:03:56,604 --> 00:04:00,219
The room temperature here is 27 C?

52
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:02,704
"Kaori Tsukihara" -When I entered this room together with you officers,

53
00:04:02,704 --> 00:04:06,004
I didn't touch the remote controller of the air conditioner, did I?

54
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:08,227
No, you didn't.

55
00:04:09,404 --> 00:04:10,904
No matter how many times we do it,

56
00:04:10,904 --> 00:04:13,104
the steam becomes invisible after about 8 minutes.

57
00:04:13,104 --> 00:04:16,004
Then, when you heard the noise and left the room,

58
00:04:16,004 --> 00:04:18,704
was there anything you noticed?

59
00:04:18,704 --> 00:04:22,241
Like see someone suspicious or hear something queer.

60
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:23,404
I wonder...

61
00:04:23,404 --> 00:04:24,904
It seems that the people on the upper floors

62
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:27,404
were trying to go down using the elevator,

63
00:04:27,404 --> 00:04:29,504
so it didn't come for a while.

64
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:31,804
So, I went down using the stairs,

65
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,253
but I didn't see anyone suspicious.

66
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:35,804
Any noise, then?

67
00:04:35,804 --> 00:04:37,304
Well...

68
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:40,004
Just before I left the room,

69
00:04:40,004 --> 00:04:43,404
I heard the sound of a bell from Mr. Ogino's room next door.

70
00:04:43,404 --> 00:04:45,504
Oh, that bell...

71
00:04:45,504 --> 00:04:49,704
It's the alarm clock by the pillow at the bedside.

72
00:04:49,704 --> 00:04:51,504
When I'm not staking out,

73
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:53,804
I always get up at 7:30 am.

74
00:04:53,804 --> 00:04:56,275
Well, but last night I got up in the middle of the night

75
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:59,004
and was watching the soccer broadcast from abroad.

76
00:05:00,504 --> 00:05:04,283
"Keisuke Ogino (34)" -And? What about the foam in the beer?

77
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,604
I tried several glasses.

78
00:05:07,604 --> 00:05:11,304
The foams seem to disappear after 6 minutes or so.

79
00:05:11,304 --> 00:05:13,604
By the way, when you left the room,

80
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,004
did you see or hear anything?

81
00:05:16,004 --> 00:05:17,304
Come to think of it,

82
00:05:17,304 --> 00:05:19,104
when I was going down the stairs,

83
00:05:19,104 --> 00:05:22,704
I heard Sodesaki below, going down.

84
00:05:22,704 --> 00:05:25,904
He always carries a bunch of keys on his hip

85
00:05:25,904 --> 00:05:28,904
and when he moves they jingle.

86
00:05:28,904 --> 00:05:30,904
Yes, I wear them,

87
00:05:30,904 --> 00:05:32,704
the bunch of keys. See.

88
00:05:34,104 --> 00:05:36,804
You sure have a lot of keys, don't you?

89
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:39,004
"Kazutomo Sodezaki (31)" -For my house, my car, my office,

90
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:41,304
my bicycle and the key for my safe.

91
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:44,323
For cigarettes to burn to ashes completely.

92
00:05:44,504 --> 00:05:46,104
It would take a little less than 9 minutes.

93
00:05:46,104 --> 00:05:50,804
Your cigarette was on the verge of burning completely, wasn't it?

94
00:05:50,804 --> 00:05:51,904
Yes.

95
00:05:51,904 --> 00:05:53,204
If so, it would mean

96
00:05:53,204 --> 00:05:57,204
that you left the room for around 9 minutes or so.

97
00:05:57,204 --> 00:05:59,304
Of course.

98
00:05:59,304 --> 00:06:01,604
You officers came to my room

99
00:06:01,604 --> 00:06:04,343
after you checked Mr. Ogino's room and all.

100
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:06,804
Then, when you came out of the room,

101
00:06:06,804 --> 00:06:09,004
was there anything that bothered you?

102
00:06:09,004 --> 00:06:10,804
A sound or a person.

103
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,804
A sound...

104
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:14,353
When I got to the site,

105
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:17,304
I heard Ms. Tsukihara's cell phone's ringtone

106
00:06:17,304 --> 00:06:19,004
among the spectators, that's about it.

107
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,104
Who was the call from?

108
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:25,604
She told me it was from the cameraman in charge.

109
00:06:25,604 --> 00:06:29,604
Something about a scoop picture or something.

110
00:06:29,604 --> 00:06:31,104
I see.

111
00:06:32,704 --> 00:06:35,004
What shall we do about those three, inspector?

112
00:06:36,704 --> 00:06:39,804
They all have enough motive,

113
00:06:39,804 --> 00:06:43,404
I guess we'll have them interrogated a bit longer.

114
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,404
An alarm clock,

115
00:06:46,404 --> 00:06:49,504
a bunch of keys and a cell phone ringtone...

116
00:06:49,504 --> 00:06:51,904
Those three said that?

117
00:06:51,904 --> 00:06:57,104
Yes, they're each going through interrogation individually.

118
00:06:57,104 --> 00:06:59,904
And? How did the experiment work out?

119
00:06:59,904 --> 00:07:02,404
The beer foam lasted for about 6 minutes.

120
00:07:02,404 --> 00:07:04,403
The steam, about 8 minutes

121
00:07:04,604 --> 00:07:07,804
and the cigarette smoke about 9 minutes.

122
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:10,409
So, room temperature had nothing to do with it.

123
00:07:12,404 --> 00:07:14,413
Officer Takagi, you look sleepy.

124
00:07:14,604 --> 00:07:15,704
Well, sort of.

125
00:07:15,704 --> 00:07:16,904
I was staking out all night,

126
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:19,304
and didn't get to sleep right through after that.

127
00:07:19,304 --> 00:07:21,904
If I use the eye drops that Chiba always uses,

128
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:25,204
I can pretend to look a bit sharp but...

129
00:07:25,204 --> 00:07:27,804
He's still staking out.

130
00:07:29,004 --> 00:07:30,204
Pretend?

131
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:34,804
Come to think of it,

132
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:37,404
pops told me once before.

133
00:07:37,404 --> 00:07:39,404
How about it, surprised?

134
00:07:39,404 --> 00:07:42,804
I used to do this when I was a poor student.

135
00:07:44,104 --> 00:07:46,445
I see. I get it.

136
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:49,104
So, he's the culprit after all.

137
00:07:49,104 --> 00:07:51,604
Do you think it'll really be okay, Conan?

138
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:55,404
I've got to start heading home soon.

139
00:07:55,404 --> 00:07:57,604
Would you like me to give you a lift?

140
00:07:57,604 --> 00:08:00,804
I'll be fine, because I have a car waiting for me.

141
00:08:00,804 --> 00:08:03,104
Besides, if you hear what I have to say,

142
00:08:03,104 --> 00:08:05,704
I'm sure that you'll end up going back again

143
00:08:05,704 --> 00:08:07,104
to that condo.

144
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:13,604
I wonder if this the first time...

145
00:08:13,604 --> 00:08:16,475
that I've been with you, just the two of us.

146
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:20,104
Come to think of it, I guess so.

147
00:08:20,104 --> 00:08:21,704
I don't really feel right

148
00:08:21,704 --> 00:08:23,404
parking right outside The Metropolitan Police Department.

149
00:08:23,404 --> 00:08:25,304
But, since I have to wait for him,

150
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,004
what do you say,

151
00:08:27,004 --> 00:08:29,204
I move the car to the parking lot and we wait inside the car?

152
00:08:29,204 --> 00:08:31,804
If you want to do so why don't you force me to do so?

153
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:36,204
I would never force you to do anything.

154
00:08:36,204 --> 00:08:38,804
Because I gave her my word.

155
00:08:42,704 --> 00:08:43,804
Then, I'm sorry,

156
00:08:43,804 --> 00:08:45,604
but could you both wait for me there.

157
00:08:45,604 --> 00:08:48,504
I'm sure that I can be back in about 30 minutes so.

158
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:54,904
I tell you... why can't you just leave it up to the police?

159
00:08:54,904 --> 00:08:59,504
Rather, are you sure you don't want to wait in the car?

160
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:01,604
You might catch a cold.

161
00:09:01,604 --> 00:09:02,804
I'll be fine.

162
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:06,904
Like they say, children love the cold.

163
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:12,304
Hey, hey, it's already pass 7:00 in the evening.

164
00:09:12,304 --> 00:09:15,504
This is getting us nowhere.

165
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:17,404
I mean you tried it out many times

166
00:09:17,404 --> 00:09:19,204
before going to interrogation at the police, didn't you?

167
00:09:19,204 --> 00:09:23,104
Why do we have to return and check the time again?

168
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,704
All my cigarettes are gone already.

169
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:29,304
After the incident when I returned to my room with the officer,

170
00:09:29,304 --> 00:09:32,551
the foam of the beer was still in the glass, wasn't it?

171
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:35,904
Steam from my coffee was still rising too.

172
00:09:35,904 --> 00:09:39,404
The smoke from my cigarette was still rising, wasn't it?

173
00:09:39,404 --> 00:09:42,204
Aren't all these proof that we were all in our rooms

174
00:09:42,204 --> 00:09:45,204
until right before the incident happened?

175
00:09:45,204 --> 00:09:49,604
Rather, why are you doing that experiment in my room?

176
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:53,404
I also wondered about that, but Officer Takagi...

177
00:09:53,404 --> 00:09:56,575
Because we'll find out if we stay here...

178
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:58,577
who the culprit is.

179
00:09:58,804 --> 00:10:00,604
Conan?

180
00:10:00,604 --> 00:10:05,804
Well, the first ones who entered the room were Officer Takagi

181
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:07,604
and I so we realized it.

182
00:10:07,604 --> 00:10:08,904
Really?

183
00:10:08,904 --> 00:10:11,504
Yes, sir.

184
00:10:11,504 --> 00:10:14,204
What did you realize?

185
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:17,404
Conan, wasn't the one who saw through the truth,

186
00:10:17,404 --> 00:10:20,604
not us two, but Shinichi Kudo.

187
00:10:20,604 --> 00:10:24,204
That's why if we carry everything out the way Shinichi said we should,

188
00:10:24,204 --> 00:10:25,604
everything will work out.

189
00:10:25,604 --> 00:10:27,104
"When the time ripens,

190
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:31,704
the traces that the culprit failed to erase will emerge."

191
00:10:31,704 --> 00:10:35,104
That's what Shinichi wrote in his mail to me.

192
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:43,532
Conan, wasn't the one who saw through the truth,

193
00:10:43,532 --> 00:10:46,625
not us two, but Shinichi Kudo.

194
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:50,629
That's why if we carry everything out the way Shinichi said we should,

195
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:51,832
everything will work out.

196
00:10:51,832 --> 00:10:53,132
"When the time ripens,

197
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:57,932
the traces that the culprit failed to erase will emerge."

198
00:10:57,932 --> 00:11:01,732
That's what Shinichi wrote in his mail to me.

199
00:11:01,732 --> 00:11:05,132
If so, I wonder why he didn't call Inspector Megure directly

200
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:06,645
and tell him the truth?

201
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:10,932
Hey. I don't know what you're up to

202
00:11:10,932 --> 00:11:13,132
but I hope you saying that, "we'll find out if we stay here"

203
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:16,655
doesn't mean that you think that I'm the one

204
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:18,657
who killed President Katsumoto?

205
00:11:18,832 --> 00:11:19,832
No.

206
00:11:19,832 --> 00:11:22,932
The culprit avoided the surveillance camera

207
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,032
in the elevator and used the stairs, right?

208
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:30,032
If I'm the one who pushed President Katsumoto off the 26th floor,

209
00:11:30,032 --> 00:11:31,732
there's no way that I could've run over to the place

210
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:35,432
in front of the condo where Katsumoto was found before these two.

211
00:11:35,432 --> 00:11:38,232
Right? I was the first to be there, wasn't I?

212
00:11:38,232 --> 00:11:41,532
Yes. When I got there,

213
00:11:41,532 --> 00:11:43,932
Ms. Tsukihara was already among the spectators.

214
00:11:43,932 --> 00:11:47,932
Then, why did you get there later than she did, Mr. Sodesaki?

215
00:11:47,932 --> 00:11:50,432
You also went there after hearing someone shout,

216
00:11:50,432 --> 00:11:52,432
"Somebody fell!" didn't you?

217
00:11:52,432 --> 00:11:53,632
Why?

218
00:11:53,632 --> 00:11:55,632
I was right in the midst of writing an article,

219
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,432
and wasn't about to stop in the middle.

220
00:11:57,432 --> 00:12:00,699
But, I was only a minute or two late.

221
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:04,032
Then, what about you Mr. Ogino,

222
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:05,632
that arrived at the scene later than Mr. Sodesaki?

223
00:12:05,632 --> 00:12:07,632
It was a scene that I couldn't afford not watching,

224
00:12:07,632 --> 00:12:09,732
so I couldn't leave right away.

225
00:12:09,732 --> 00:12:12,232
Because I was watching the soccer game on TV.

226
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,732
What scene couldn't you afford not to see?

227
00:12:14,732 --> 00:12:16,715
I forgot.

228
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:18,717
I think a super pass was made or something,

229
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:21,332
a corner kick... or it could've been anything.

230
00:12:21,332 --> 00:12:23,232
Which means that you were absorbed

231
00:12:23,232 --> 00:12:24,723
in watching the soccer game, right, Mr. Ogino?

232
00:12:24,932 --> 00:12:26,432
Yes, that's right.

233
00:12:26,432 --> 00:12:29,132
So much that I almost couldn't hear the noise outside.

234
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:30,732
If so...

235
00:12:30,732 --> 00:12:32,332
Wasn't it noisy?

236
00:12:35,432 --> 00:12:37,932
The bell of the alarm clock?

237
00:12:37,932 --> 00:12:39,532
Come to think of it,

238
00:12:39,532 --> 00:12:42,332
I heard it when I left the room to go check the noise outside.

239
00:12:42,332 --> 00:12:46,745
This bell is the sound of the alarm clock in your room, isn't it?

240
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:48,747
Yes, most probably.

241
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:51,732
It's 7:30 in the evening now.

242
00:12:51,732 --> 00:12:56,755
I heard that you always set your alarm to ring at 7:30 in the morning.

243
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:58,757
Why is it ringing even now?

244
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:03,232
It's because you left the bell ringing without stopping it,

245
00:13:03,232 --> 00:13:06,232
and made it stop on its own?

246
00:13:06,232 --> 00:13:10,769
In other words, that's proof that you weren't in your room back then.

247
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,532
You couldn't have been calmly watching a soccer game in this room

248
00:13:13,532 --> 00:13:16,132
with the alarm ringing as loud as it was.

249
00:13:16,132 --> 00:13:19,432
So loud that it could be heard all the way to this room next door.

250
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:22,132
Well, you could've been concerned of the noise outside,

251
00:13:22,132 --> 00:13:23,832
and it's understandable if you left the room

252
00:13:23,832 --> 00:13:25,732
without taking note of the alarm ringing in your room.

253
00:13:25,732 --> 00:13:29,632
If so, you would've at least had to be at the site

254
00:13:29,632 --> 00:13:32,032
before Mr. Sodesaki, no?

255
00:13:32,032 --> 00:13:33,132
How about it?

256
00:13:33,132 --> 00:13:34,532
Oh, that's right.

257
00:13:34,532 --> 00:13:36,795
I remember.

258
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:38,532
The john, I went to the men's room.

259
00:13:38,532 --> 00:13:41,732
Back then, I was doing my thing in the john.

260
00:13:41,732 --> 00:13:44,532
I thought the alarm clock was ringing

261
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,332
but I couldn't stop it.

262
00:13:46,332 --> 00:13:49,732
I heard somebody say, "Somebody fell!" before I went to the john,

263
00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:53,332
and was concerned, but I couldn't hold it any longer.

264
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,432
And, you mean the alarm had stopped after you came out of the restroom

265
00:13:56,432 --> 00:13:58,817
and headed for the site then?

266
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:02,532
Yes. After watching soccer for a while though.

267
00:14:02,532 --> 00:14:05,832
Darn, his story's consistent.

268
00:14:05,832 --> 00:14:09,432
And besides, didn't you say, officer...

269
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,832
If I were the culprit, used the stairs,

270
00:14:10,832 --> 00:14:15,132
went up 23 floors to the president's room to push him off,

271
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:17,532
and ran down the stairs to the first floor.

272
00:14:17,532 --> 00:14:19,532
It would mean that my room would've been empty

273
00:14:19,532 --> 00:14:22,841
for more than 10 minutes until you came to my room.

274
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:24,332
The foam of the beer would've been gone,

275
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:27,932
like that beer, if left as is for 10 minutes.

276
00:14:29,132 --> 00:14:31,832
But when you came to my room, officer,

277
00:14:31,832 --> 00:14:34,632
there was still a lot of foam in my beer glass, wasn't there?

278
00:14:34,632 --> 00:14:36,332
Or, are you insinuating

279
00:14:36,332 --> 00:14:39,832
that I used magic or something to make the beer foam?

280
00:14:39,832 --> 00:14:43,532
Abracadabra.

281
00:14:43,532 --> 00:14:47,532
How strange. There's so much foam.

282
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:53,732
The foam should've been gone and yet why?

283
00:14:53,732 --> 00:14:57,532
I poured in the salt that I found in the kitchen of this room.

284
00:14:57,532 --> 00:15:00,879
If you pour salt into beer, will it foam up?

285
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,232
If it's any type of grain that sinks in beer,

286
00:15:03,232 --> 00:15:06,032
I guess anything will do whether it's sugar, sand, and so on.

287
00:15:06,032 --> 00:15:08,232
The point is, when it sinks,

288
00:15:08,232 --> 00:15:11,332
and a lot of space is created between the air and beer,

289
00:15:11,332 --> 00:15:15,332
carbon dioxide seems to gather there, and create foams.

290
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:17,832
So, see.

291
00:15:17,832 --> 00:15:19,932
In the other beer glasses where the foams have disappeared,

292
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:21,932
if you pour salt into them...

293
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:26,905
-True. -Wow.

294
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:30,632
But, Conan, it's amazing that you knew something like this.

295
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:34,332
Pops Kogoro told me about it once.

296
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:36,432
How about it, surprised?

297
00:15:36,432 --> 00:15:38,132
When I was a poor student,

298
00:15:38,132 --> 00:15:40,632
I used to use this method a lot.

299
00:15:40,632 --> 00:15:42,921
When he was a university student he was poor,

300
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:46,132
so he used to pour in salt occasionally so people wouldn't notice

301
00:15:46,132 --> 00:15:48,232
that he was sipping beer that lost all foam.

302
00:15:48,232 --> 00:15:49,532
By the way,

303
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:54,532
it seems that this method is also used when taking pictures of beer.

304
00:15:54,532 --> 00:15:58,732
Because it looks more delicious with foam.

305
00:15:58,732 --> 00:16:02,232
It's something that you, a cameraman would know about.

306
00:16:02,232 --> 00:16:06,032
But... I didn't have any salt on me back then.

307
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,947
But, Mr. Ogino, when we came into the room

308
00:16:09,132 --> 00:16:12,951
you kicked the package that was at the entrance, didn't you?

309
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:22,432
That was something you brought back from the funeral, right?

310
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:25,432
If so, it would've been inside, no?

311
00:16:25,432 --> 00:16:27,432
The "cleansing salt".

312
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:31,632
I see, so he used that salt.

313
00:16:31,632 --> 00:16:33,932
Yes, most likely.

314
00:16:33,932 --> 00:16:36,532
Because after he kicked it,

315
00:16:36,532 --> 00:16:38,332
he returned the tea package that fell out.

316
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:42,032
Back then, he took out the "cleansing salt"

317
00:16:42,032 --> 00:16:43,432
and snuck it into his pocket.

318
00:16:43,432 --> 00:16:45,332
He then broke the packet open,

319
00:16:45,332 --> 00:16:46,985
picked up several grains of salt.

320
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:50,989
Then, just before showing me the beer glass,

321
00:16:51,232 --> 00:16:54,732
poured salt into it and showed me the beer with foams.

322
00:16:54,732 --> 00:16:58,232
Well, it must've been a trick that he thought up

323
00:16:58,232 --> 00:17:02,032
at the spur of the moment.

324
00:17:02,032 --> 00:17:04,132
Even if he were to have disposed of the salt packet somewhere,

325
00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:07,005
there should be several grains of salt left in his pocket.

326
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:10,432
Besides, if he did push someone off the veranda,

327
00:17:10,432 --> 00:17:13,011
they must've struggled slightly.

328
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:15,032
And if you consider the fact that

329
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:19,017
he had to rush out of the room as soon as possible,

330
00:17:19,232 --> 00:17:24,132
if we check the carpet that President Katsumoto had installed last night,

331
00:17:24,132 --> 00:17:25,832
I'm sure we'll still be able to find it, no?

332
00:17:27,232 --> 00:17:30,232
The trace of you having gone to the President's room

333
00:17:30,232 --> 00:17:33,632
between last night and this morning.

334
00:17:36,232 --> 00:17:40,232
But, it's hard to believe

335
00:17:40,232 --> 00:17:41,632
that Mr. Ogino would kill President Katsumoto.

336
00:17:41,632 --> 00:17:43,432
Right. Because even the lawyer told us

337
00:17:43,432 --> 00:17:47,045
that our chances of winning were good.

338
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:50,132
In the first place, you said so too, Mr. Ogino.

339
00:17:50,132 --> 00:17:53,051
That on the memory card that had the successive pictures in it,

340
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:55,532
the fingerprints of the president were on,

341
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,732
so that it would prove that...

342
00:17:56,732 --> 00:17:59,532
the president had chosen the pictures in question,

343
00:17:59,532 --> 00:18:01,059
on his own and put them on the magazine.

344
00:18:02,632 --> 00:18:04,332
Why would he want to kill the president

345
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:06,132
knowing that he would be winning the case?

346
00:18:06,132 --> 00:18:08,332
It disappeared.

347
00:18:08,332 --> 00:18:09,932
Disappeared?

348
00:18:09,932 --> 00:18:13,932
Since I received that strange mail this morning from the president,

349
00:18:13,932 --> 00:18:16,832
I had this uneasy feeling, so I checked...

350
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:21,932
and found that the memory card had disappeared from my camera bag.

351
00:18:23,732 --> 00:18:27,085
I had an idea of who it was right away,

352
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:29,432
so I went to the president's room

353
00:18:29,432 --> 00:18:31,089
and pressed him for an answer. Just as I thought...

354
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:32,732
Cut it out.

355
00:18:32,732 --> 00:18:36,132
Why don't you ask your assistant who quit the other day

356
00:18:36,132 --> 00:18:37,432
about that memory card?

357
00:18:37,432 --> 00:18:39,632
Well, I'm sure he split somewhere abroad

358
00:18:39,632 --> 00:18:42,632
after making a lot of cash and is enjoying himself.

359
00:18:42,632 --> 00:18:45,432
I don't think you can contact him by phone either.

360
00:18:45,432 --> 00:18:47,105
Just as I thought...

361
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:50,232
You paid him to steal that memory card.

362
00:18:51,332 --> 00:18:55,432
He told me that you guys were planning to place charges against me.

363
00:18:55,432 --> 00:18:57,832
Well, if you're not going to withdraw charges,

364
00:18:57,832 --> 00:19:00,132
I've got something in mind too.

365
00:19:00,132 --> 00:19:05,532
Those successive pictures will be used as a newly acquired scoop too.

366
00:19:06,532 --> 00:19:12,032
With the headline, "A Ruthless Cameraman who Sold his Classmate."

367
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:16,332
Classmate?

368
00:19:16,332 --> 00:19:17,832
With that actress?

369
00:19:17,832 --> 00:19:21,132
Yes, we were classmates in intermediate school.

370
00:19:21,132 --> 00:19:24,532
That's why I knew that the guy who was with her

371
00:19:24,532 --> 00:19:27,145
was her younger step-brother.

372
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:30,632
And I didn't take that picture without permission.

373
00:19:31,732 --> 00:19:36,032
I took it right in front of them so that I could send it to them.

374
00:19:36,032 --> 00:19:39,632
My assistant, mistook that picture

375
00:19:39,632 --> 00:19:41,159
and showed it to the president on his own

376
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:42,932
and made up that darn article.

377
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:47,165
That's why I couldn't forgive him

378
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:51,432
when thinking that the picture that I took

379
00:19:51,432 --> 00:19:54,732
served as a factor in driving her to commit suicide.

380
00:19:54,732 --> 00:19:57,432
By the time I snapped back to myself,

381
00:19:57,432 --> 00:20:00,732
the president was lying flat on the ground like a frog.

382
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:07,185
But, for a murder that wasn't planned ahead of time,

383
00:20:07,432 --> 00:20:11,189
I thought that the beer foam trick would get me through.

384
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:13,832
To think that the trick actually lead to me being suspected

385
00:20:13,832 --> 00:20:16,132
and even served as proof against me...

386
00:20:18,632 --> 00:20:21,199
I suspected you as being the culprit

387
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:23,932
ever since I heard that you were a cameraman.

388
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,203
No joke.

389
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:28,632
Because when you got to the site,

390
00:20:28,632 --> 00:20:32,432
all you had on you was your cell phone and nothing else.

391
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:36,132
That's why I had my eye on you from the start.

392
00:20:36,132 --> 00:20:38,932
But, if he heard the commotion and came,

393
00:20:38,932 --> 00:20:40,332
having nothing on him would be natural.

394
00:20:40,332 --> 00:20:41,732
No.

395
00:20:41,732 --> 00:20:48,732
A press cameraman would never forget the camera

396
00:20:48,732 --> 00:20:51,229
that brings in the bread.

397
00:22:15,732 --> 00:22:18,432
Well, how amazing, Officer Takagi!

398
00:22:18,432 --> 00:22:20,432
You're pretty good when you want to be.

399
00:22:20,432 --> 00:22:22,232
Right.

400
00:22:22,232 --> 00:22:25,323
Oh, well, not really...

401
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:29,327
All I did was talk as was written in Shinichi's mail though.

402
00:22:31,329 --> 00:22:34,332
It seems that the case has been solved...

403
00:23:24,232 --> 00:23:27,032
From here, it's my area.

404
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:29,032
It's not where you come in.

405
00:23:32,132 --> 00:23:35,393
Adults get cold easily and don't like the cold.

406
00:23:35,632 --> 00:23:37,395
What's the matter? Both of you...

407
00:23:38,832 --> 00:23:40,332
The door's left opened.

408
00:23:40,332 --> 00:23:41,399
It's nothing.

409
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:42,532
Let's go home.

410
00:23:42,532 --> 00:23:43,932
Let's go.

411
00:23:43,932 --> 00:23:46,232
It's getting a bit chilly.

412
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,860
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,423
"Puppy".

414
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,056
Kogoro, you did it.

415
00:24:08,056 --> 00:24:09,740
I'm not just drinking.

416
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,060
No, I think you are.
