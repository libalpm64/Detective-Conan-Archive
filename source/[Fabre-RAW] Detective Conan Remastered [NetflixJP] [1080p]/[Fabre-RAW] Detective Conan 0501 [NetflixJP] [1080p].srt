1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,050
The Black Organization that shrunk my body.

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,750
After repeated attempts to grasp a chance

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,450
to disclose their identity,

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,450
the FBI ends up on my side pursuing the same goal.

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,950
Eisuke Hondo who searches for the whereabouts of his sister and father,

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,050
lands up at Haido Central Hospital

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,650
where the FBI was hiding the Organization member, Kir,

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,550
"Rena Mizunashi, Kir" -commonly known as Rena Mizunashi.

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,250
"Jodie Starling" -We had tracked down Rikumichi Kusuda,

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,650
a member of the Organization sent to get Rena back.

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,050
But when he failed to report,

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,350
"Gin, Vodka" -Gin and the others finally make their move,

13
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,950
"Gin, Vodka" -and we are ruthlessly attacked by them.

14
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,250
"Vermouth"

15
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,050
"James Black" -During the uproar over the bombs

16
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,550
the Organization had planted,

17
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,750
"Camel Andre" -we execute a plan to move Rena Mizunashi.

18
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,950
Gin sees through our plan

19
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,950
and Rena Mizunashi is taken away by the Black Organization.

20
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,550
"Shuichi Akai" -However, it was a plan

21
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,150
that Mr. Akai and I had thought up.

22
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,850
Rena Mizunashi actually happens to be an agent of the CIA,

23
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,150
"Rena Mizunashi, Hidemi Hondo" -and also Eisuke's older sister, Hidemi.

24
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,950
Due to the bone-marrow surgery that he underwent when he was a child,

25
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,950
his blood type had changed.

26
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,350
We also found out that...

27
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,250
"Ethern Hondo" -Ethern Hondo being killed by Rena Mizunashi,

28
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,450
was actually a one-man act carried out by Ethern himself

29
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,650
to save his daughter's life from the Organization.

30
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,550
I hope you're not going to tell me

31
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:32,450
to go back to the Organization again.

32
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,050
Of course.

33
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,050
That's what I'm going to ask you to do.

34
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,850
Sizzling hot suspense.

35
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,350
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

36
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,950
The fight to get Rena Mizunashi has ended?

37
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,250
The suspect for a new incident...

38
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,750
is a FBI agent.

39
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,250
He sees through the one and only truth.

40
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,950
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

41
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,950
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

42
00:03:33,217 --> 00:03:37,217
"Red and Black Crash: Suspicion"

43
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:41,217
"Haido Central Hospital" -I see.

44
00:03:41,217 --> 00:03:45,217
So, you deliberately gave Rena Mizunashi over to those guys.

45
00:03:46,217 --> 00:03:47,417
You told her to sneak in there

46
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:50,417
and investigate all kinds of things about them as she had previously doing.

47
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:51,417
Yes.

48
00:03:51,417 --> 00:03:53,517
Not as one who cooperates with the FBI,

49
00:03:53,517 --> 00:03:56,517
but as a CIA agent.

50
00:03:56,517 --> 00:03:59,017
Which means that the sound of you being struck

51
00:03:59,017 --> 00:04:00,617
just before the Organization got her back

52
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:02,617
was also foul play?

53
00:04:04,217 --> 00:04:05,517
Yes.

54
00:04:05,517 --> 00:04:08,717
Mr. Akai told me to act like I had passed out after being struck

55
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:11,717
and to stop the car.

56
00:04:11,717 --> 00:04:16,717
I didn't think that I was really going to be struck though.

57
00:04:16,717 --> 00:04:20,217
I asked her to do so.

58
00:04:20,217 --> 00:04:23,917
Because if by chance, you happened to be killed.

59
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:27,017
If there is no trace on your neck that you had been struck,

60
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,717
it would endanger the life of Rena Mizunashi.

61
00:04:29,717 --> 00:04:32,217
True.

62
00:04:32,217 --> 00:04:33,617
But...

63
00:04:33,617 --> 00:04:36,017
If so, it wouldn't have hurt to tell us so!

64
00:04:36,017 --> 00:04:38,217
Exactly.

65
00:04:38,217 --> 00:04:41,617
You can't even tell how shocked and depressed we were

66
00:04:41,617 --> 00:04:43,817
to find that she had been taken by them again.

67
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,817
That's exactly what we were after.

68
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:47,317
It's more than likely that

69
00:04:47,317 --> 00:04:51,317
they had been monitoring the wireless of the FBI.

70
00:04:51,317 --> 00:04:55,017
Unless we are genuinely disappointed about her being taken away,

71
00:04:55,017 --> 00:04:57,517
they probably wouldn't have been convinced.

72
00:04:57,517 --> 00:05:00,917
It had to be real, no acting.

73
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:03,417
But, I just can't figure how you could even think of returning her back

74
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:05,417
into the Organization as an agent of the CIA.

75
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:08,017
It's not like we plain returned her.

76
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:09,217
We told her that...

77
00:05:09,217 --> 00:05:11,817
after we report the Organization's information to CIA headquarters,

78
00:05:15,117 --> 00:05:18,817
It... it's amazing that she agreed to something like that.

79
00:05:18,817 --> 00:05:20,117
Yes.

80
00:05:20,117 --> 00:05:23,017
Of course she came up with a request

81
00:05:23,017 --> 00:05:26,087
that was equal to what we asked her to do.

82
00:05:26,087 --> 00:05:26,117
The witness protection program?
that was equal to what we asked her to do.

83
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,887
The witness protection program?

84
00:05:28,887 --> 00:05:31,087
You want us to apply that to your younger brother?

85
00:05:31,087 --> 00:05:32,487
Yes.

86
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:35,487
I'll write to Ei-chan telling him

87
00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:37,687
to obey the request.

88
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:40,287
You'll do that for me, won't you?

89
00:05:40,287 --> 00:05:43,387
After all you're telling me to deliberately return to a place

90
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:45,387
where they suspect me of being a spy for the CIA.

91
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,587
Yeah.

92
00:05:46,617 --> 00:05:50,117
I guarantee the FBI will take care of your younger brother.

93
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:52,417
And...

94
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:54,817
No matter what the reason maybe...

95
00:05:54,817 --> 00:05:57,517
the mission of my father for CIA will be top priority.

96
00:05:57,517 --> 00:06:00,017
So, please don't be offended

97
00:06:00,017 --> 00:06:02,017
if it turns out to be inconvenient for the FBI.

98
00:06:02,017 --> 00:06:06,017
Yes. I was just thinking of saying the same thing.

99
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:10,517
Right, sonny?

100
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:12,417
Yep.

101
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:15,317
Witness Protection Program...

102
00:06:15,317 --> 00:06:18,717
I'm pretty sure it can be applied to him

103
00:06:18,717 --> 00:06:21,817
because he knows the email address of the boss.

104
00:06:21,817 --> 00:06:24,517
But I'm worried about the people in this hospital too!

105
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,717
Those guys will probably think that they all protected Rena Mizunashi here

106
00:06:27,717 --> 00:06:31,317
in cooperation with the FBI.

107
00:06:31,317 --> 00:06:32,417
We've got to do something.

108
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:33,817
It'll be fine.

109
00:06:33,817 --> 00:06:37,517
-Huh? -I think it's about time that Rena Mizunashi is...

110
00:06:42,517 --> 00:06:45,317
Don't do anything to that hospital?

111
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:47,417
Are you saying to leave the people that lent a hand to the FBI alone

112
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:48,917
without doing anything?

113
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:52,817
No. It looks like they didn't cooperate or anything.

114
00:06:52,817 --> 00:06:54,417
It seems that the FBI lied saying that

115
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:58,417
I was Shuichi Akai's younger sister and hospitalized me.

116
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:02,017
But you're a popular announcer that everyone knows.

117
00:07:02,017 --> 00:07:05,517
They had to say I resembled her a number of times.

118
00:07:05,517 --> 00:07:06,917
If I were to be the announcer herself,

119
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:10,717
I'm sure the media would've made a big fuss over it too.

120
00:07:10,717 --> 00:07:14,017
Of course I'm sure that the FBI was doing their best

121
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:17,517
to hide my whereabouts too.

122
00:07:17,517 --> 00:07:20,217
What's up, Kir?

123
00:07:20,217 --> 00:07:23,017
Why are you so hung up about that hospital?

124
00:07:23,017 --> 00:07:25,117
Is there something to that place?

125
00:07:25,117 --> 00:07:26,217
No.

126
00:07:26,217 --> 00:07:32,117
It's just that I don't feel good about killing people

127
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:34,417
who gave me treatment for my wounds.

128
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:39,617
Besides, if that hospital was cooperating with the FBI,

129
00:07:39,617 --> 00:07:43,017
as soon as they find out that you guys are coming to get me back,

130
00:07:43,017 --> 00:07:46,317
I'm sure they would've taken some sort of measure toward it.

131
00:07:47,517 --> 00:07:49,117
I guess we won't do anything for now,

132
00:07:49,117 --> 00:07:50,817
with all due respect for you.

133
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:53,017
For now?

134
00:07:53,017 --> 00:07:54,417
I don't like the idea.

135
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:55,717
Huh?

136
00:07:55,717 --> 00:07:57,617
I can't believe that Akai would think up a plan

137
00:07:57,617 --> 00:08:01,817
that would so simply get Kir back to us.

138
00:08:01,817 --> 00:08:04,917
I'm sure he's still got something up his sleeve.

139
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:10,017
Come to think of it, we didn't get to kill him.

140
00:08:10,017 --> 00:08:11,517
Right.

141
00:08:11,517 --> 00:08:14,117
I was so sure that he would show up one way or another

142
00:08:14,117 --> 00:08:17,517
when we went to get Kir back.

143
00:08:17,517 --> 00:08:21,517
Maybe that's just the kind of man he was to begin with?

144
00:08:48,817 --> 00:08:53,617
Oh, so that announcer called Rena Mizunashi was a CIA agent.

145
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:54,917
Yeah.

146
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:59,117
Thanks to her agreeing to go back into the Black Organization,

147
00:08:59,117 --> 00:09:01,717
we're finally getting somewhere.

148
00:09:01,717 --> 00:09:04,317
Which means we have a chance of crushing them.

149
00:09:04,317 --> 00:09:06,717
Well. I guess you already know,

150
00:09:06,717 --> 00:09:09,617
but don't make too light of the Organization.

151
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:10,917
Gin, in particular.

152
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,617
Yeah. I know.

153
00:09:13,617 --> 00:09:15,917
I wonder if you really know.

154
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:17,017
Huh?

155
00:09:17,017 --> 00:09:19,917
And that boy Eisuke...

156
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:22,617
did he say he was going to accept the Witness Protection Program?

157
00:09:22,617 --> 00:09:23,817
No.

158
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:25,817
I heard that he doesn't want to.

159
00:09:25,817 --> 00:09:27,017
Although it seems that the people of the FBI

160
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:29,217
are trying to explain it to him.

161
00:09:29,217 --> 00:09:32,017
I would think so. I refused too.

162
00:09:32,017 --> 00:09:35,017
Well, I guess it can't be helped

163
00:09:35,017 --> 00:09:36,417
because it's a system in which your name

164
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:37,417
and citizenship are completely changed

165
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:39,517
and you end up being a totally different person.

166
00:09:39,517 --> 00:09:41,017
The fact is...

167
00:09:41,017 --> 00:09:43,317
I'm hoping that he would refuse just like you did

168
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:46,617
and work alongside me.

169
00:09:46,617 --> 00:09:50,917
He maybe a klutz but he sure is sharp.

170
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:52,617
But, are sure he'll be okay?

171
00:09:52,617 --> 00:09:54,817
Because unlike me, it seems that he'll go on his own

172
00:09:54,817 --> 00:09:56,017
and do something reckless.

173
00:09:56,017 --> 00:09:57,517
No need to worry.

174
00:09:57,517 --> 00:10:01,217
For now, Jodie and Mr. Akai are always near him.

175
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:03,817
Oh, I'd sure like to meet

176
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:05,217
this man called Akai.

177
00:10:05,217 --> 00:10:06,617
Huh? Why?

178
00:10:06,617 --> 00:10:08,217
No matter what you maybe on the inside,

179
00:10:08,217 --> 00:10:11,217
you outwardly look to be a first grader.

180
00:10:11,217 --> 00:10:13,217
I'm really interested in him,

181
00:10:13,217 --> 00:10:15,417
because despite you being a child,

182
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:16,517
this sharp FBI agent lends an ear to you.

183
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:19,217
Oh yeah...

184
00:10:19,217 --> 00:10:20,617
What?

185
00:10:20,617 --> 00:10:22,717
Is there any reason you can't introduce him to me?

186
00:10:22,717 --> 00:10:24,017
Oh, no.

187
00:10:24,017 --> 00:10:26,017
I couldn't possibly tell her.

188
00:10:26,017 --> 00:10:27,217
Hey...

189
00:10:27,217 --> 00:10:29,817
I can't possibly tell her that he's the guy that approached your sister,

190
00:10:29,817 --> 00:10:32,017
so that he could sneak into the Organization,

191
00:10:32,017 --> 00:10:33,417
became her lover

192
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:36,817
and as a result created a reason for them to kill her.

193
00:10:36,817 --> 00:10:39,717
I'm sure she already knows what he looks like besides.

194
00:10:39,717 --> 00:10:41,017
Don't tell me that...

195
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:42,117
Don't tell me that he's...

196
00:10:43,117 --> 00:10:45,317
That he has Lolita complex

197
00:10:45,317 --> 00:10:47,417
or something like that?

198
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:49,017
Huh? You mean I'm right?

199
00:10:49,017 --> 00:10:50,217
Talk about stupid!

200
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:54,117
You guys are talking secrets, just the two of you again!

201
00:10:54,117 --> 00:10:56,417
You just said stupid, didn't you?

202
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:59,717
Hey, I hope you weren't talking about me?

203
00:10:59,717 --> 00:11:01,817
No, we weren't.

204
00:11:01,817 --> 00:11:04,617
We were talking about the buffet we're headed for.

205
00:11:04,617 --> 00:11:08,117
Right, we didn't say stupid,

206
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:10,417
but was wondering if they'd have stewed buttered clam.

207
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:11,417
Huh?

208
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:12,617
Stewed buttered clam?

209
00:11:12,617 --> 00:11:14,817
Stewed buttered, what's that?

210
00:11:14,817 --> 00:11:17,217
I never heard of that before!

211
00:11:17,217 --> 00:11:19,917
Well... it's said to be very tasty.

212
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:22,617
That this especially is reputed to be a delicious dish

213
00:11:22,617 --> 00:11:26,417
of the buffet in this hotel.

214
00:11:29,717 --> 00:11:31,417
That's amazing!

215
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:33,317
There are so many dishes!

216
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,417
Yes, there sure are a lot to choose from!

217
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:37,617
You mean, this is really all-you-can-eat stuff?

218
00:11:37,617 --> 00:11:39,717
Yeah. But don't over eat

219
00:11:39,717 --> 00:11:41,117
and come down with a stomach ache, mind you.

220
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,317
-Everything looks so delicious! -I'm going to take a lot!

221
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:47,717
I'll take this, and this...

222
00:11:49,717 --> 00:11:52,017
Doing something like this at times is good too, isn't it?

223
00:11:52,017 --> 00:11:53,017
Yeah.

224
00:11:55,017 --> 00:11:57,417
A police car? This hotel?

225
00:12:03,217 --> 00:12:04,217
Officer Takagi!

226
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:08,417
Oh! Conan!

227
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:11,617
What? A homicide?

228
00:12:11,617 --> 00:12:13,517
You mean at this hotel?

229
00:12:13,517 --> 00:12:14,817
Quiet.

230
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,317
Since this has still not been made public.

231
00:12:17,317 --> 00:12:19,917
And, who was killed?

232
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:23,517
The president of a foreign talent production company

233
00:12:23,517 --> 00:12:27,017
that has an office on the 39th floor of this hotel.

234
00:12:27,017 --> 00:12:29,417
The one who found him is his secretary

235
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:30,817
and she says that when she got back,

236
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:34,217
she found him smeared with blood sitting in his chair.

237
00:12:34,217 --> 00:12:37,617
He's been shot in several places in the top part of his body.

238
00:12:37,617 --> 00:12:39,017
According to his secretary,

239
00:12:39,017 --> 00:12:43,517
the president had an appointment to meet a new talent,

240
00:12:43,517 --> 00:12:47,317
so the suspicious one is that person.

241
00:12:47,317 --> 00:12:50,317
It's a man that the president saw on the street and scouted,

242
00:12:50,317 --> 00:12:52,517
but his secretary hasn't met him yet,

243
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:55,817
so she doesn't know what he looks like or what his name is.

244
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,117
What time did the secretary report this?

245
00:12:58,117 --> 00:13:00,517
About two or three minutes ago.

246
00:13:00,517 --> 00:13:03,417
The estimated time of the crime is one or two minutes before that.

247
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:05,917
I just happened to be doing some questioning nearby,

248
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:07,917
that's why I was able to come here right away.

249
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:10,917
How did you figure out the time he was murdered?

250
00:13:10,917 --> 00:13:13,317
The secretary was in the warehouse two floors down

251
00:13:13,317 --> 00:13:17,117
organizing some things.

252
00:13:17,117 --> 00:13:18,817
About five minutes ago,

253
00:13:18,817 --> 00:13:21,117
the president asked her to check on something for him,

254
00:13:21,117 --> 00:13:24,417
and she called him a minute later to report what she found,

255
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:26,817
but she said she got the answer phone.

256
00:13:26,817 --> 00:13:31,617
Which means that the killer may still be inside this hotel.

257
00:13:31,617 --> 00:13:33,917
Huh? I think more than five minutes have passed

258
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:36,317
since it happened though.

259
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:37,317
But just look at that.

260
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:41,117
Out of the three elevators there are,

261
00:13:41,117 --> 00:13:43,917
the second elevator is out of order and under maintenance,

262
00:13:43,917 --> 00:13:45,617
and first elevator is moving,

263
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:46,717
but since everybody rides it,

264
00:13:46,717 --> 00:13:48,417
it takes a while for it to come,

265
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:49,817
so I think it's constantly full of people

266
00:13:49,817 --> 00:13:52,517
from the restaurant arcade on the top floor.

267
00:13:52,517 --> 00:13:54,217
I see...

268
00:13:54,217 --> 00:13:56,417
I guess you can't ride it if it's full.

269
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:58,517
Huh? Why not?

270
00:13:58,517 --> 00:13:59,917
Because after you shoot a gun,

271
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:01,817
the smell of gun powder sticks on.

272
00:14:04,217 --> 00:14:06,517
So, I guess the killer would avoid

273
00:14:06,517 --> 00:14:08,117
getting on an elevator that's full.

274
00:14:08,117 --> 00:14:13,317
Which means the killer went up five flights of stairs,

275
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:16,117
and is eating at the restaurant arcade on the top floor,

276
00:14:16,117 --> 00:14:19,117
or is hiding in the restroom of that floor,

277
00:14:19,117 --> 00:14:21,917
or is perspiring profusely and going down the stairs.

278
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:24,217
Either way, if the person speaks Japanese

279
00:14:24,217 --> 00:14:27,617
and is a foreigner who is working as a talent,

280
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,117
it shouldn't be difficult to find the person, right?

281
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:45,029
"Sunouchi Foreign Talent Production"

282
00:14:51,229 --> 00:14:54,929
Then, when you found President Sunouchi,

283
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:57,729
there was no one in this room?

284
00:14:57,729 --> 00:15:00,029
No, there wasn't.

285
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:05,029
And what did the president want you to check for him?

286
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,029
"Irina Palmer, age 24" -He asked me to pick out the files of the talents

287
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:11,029
"Irina Palmer, age 24" -who were hired 10 years ago.

288
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:12,529
Since I finished doing so,

289
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:15,329
I called him to ask him if he wanted me to take them to him.

290
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:18,129
But after many calls,

291
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:20,929
I just got the answer phone.

292
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:25,829
By the way, do you happen to have any idea who that new talent

293
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:27,629
that the president was going to meet today was?

294
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:31,329
No, until the president formally hires you,

295
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:34,529
he doesn't let anyone see you.

296
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:36,629
It was the same for me too.

297
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:39,329
Which means you're a talent too?

298
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:40,629
Yes.

299
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:44,229
But, since I can't write Japanese,

300
00:15:44,229 --> 00:15:48,429
he told me to work as his secretary and study for a while.

301
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:51,129
But Kanji is so difficult

302
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:53,329
that I have all emails from the president

303
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:55,229
written to me in English even now.

304
00:15:56,829 --> 00:15:58,229
But, without knowing what the culprit looks like

305
00:15:58,229 --> 00:16:00,629
or not even knowing the name,

306
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:03,129
it's going to be pretty tough finding the culprit.

307
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,529
No! Inspector Megure!

308
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:07,129
Huh? Oh, Officer Takagi?

309
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:09,529
Inspector! We've found two!

310
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:10,629
What?

311
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:13,529
Both are suspicious foreigners who speak fluent Japanese.

312
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:16,429
Suspicious? What's suspicious about them?

313
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:17,429
Yes sir.

314
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:20,629
One of them was loitering around the restaurant

315
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:23,729
and the other was hiding in the toilet.

316
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:29,229
So, what makes them suspicious?

317
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:33,229
Conan said so.

318
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:35,329
Takagi.

319
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:38,129
Since there's only one elevator working right now,

320
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:41,829
any foreigner that is near the areas I just mentioned should be suspected.

321
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:43,829
Don't tell me you told him about the case

322
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:44,929
without permission again?

323
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:46,929
I'm sorry.

324
00:16:46,929 --> 00:16:49,529
I guess I just did it out of habit.

325
00:16:50,929 --> 00:16:52,229
But, all for the better!

326
00:16:52,229 --> 00:16:55,129
He was able to bring in suspects like them.

327
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:56,629
It's nothing to complain about.

328
00:16:58,129 --> 00:16:59,529
Takagi.

329
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:01,329
I'm sorry.

330
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:04,429
And were they the only two you found?

331
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:06,229
Oh, no.

332
00:17:06,229 --> 00:17:09,229
Officer Chiba and the others are checking the stairs.

333
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,529
Inspector!

334
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,229
-How was it? -I found one more!

335
00:17:13,229 --> 00:17:15,429
He's a pretty suspicious foreigner

336
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:18,229
who was perspiring profusely going down the stairs!

337
00:17:18,229 --> 00:17:19,629
See! Come over here!

338
00:17:19,629 --> 00:17:22,429
Oh, so like I've been saying you're mistaken.

339
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:24,529
Never mind, just hurry up and do as you're told!

340
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:31,729
Conan.

341
00:17:31,729 --> 00:17:33,429
Agent Camel?

342
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:35,329
Why...

343
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:41,229
Oh, right.

344
00:17:41,229 --> 00:17:44,229
It's a secret to the Japanese police

345
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,529
that he's here as an agent of the FBI.

346
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:49,029
But, why was he here at this hotel

347
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:50,429
which is the site of a crime?

348
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:54,029
And, why is he dressed in a jersey outfit?

349
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:00,529
So, there are three suspects.

350
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:01,529
"Toby Keynes, age 27" -Yes.

351
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:03,729
"Toby Keynes, age 27" -This is Mr. Toby Keynes who was loitering

352
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:05,129
"Toby Keynes, age 27" -around the restaurant arcade on the top floor.

353
00:18:05,129 --> 00:18:07,529
"Hal Buckner, age 28" -He's Mr. Hal Buckner

354
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:09,329
"Hal Buckner, age 28" -who was hiding in the toilet on the same floor.

355
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:12,129
"Andre Camel, age 27" -And this is Mr. Andre Camel

356
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:14,429
"Andre Camel, age 27" -who was perspiring profusely going down the stairs.

357
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:16,029
Hey...

358
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:19,129
it sounds bad when you say I was loitering.

359
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:22,629
I was just trying to decide where to eat.

360
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:26,129
I see you speak fluent Japanese.

361
00:18:26,129 --> 00:18:30,329
Yeah, my father's American and my mother's Japanese.

362
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:33,129
That's why I'm working as a model,

363
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:35,529
because of my Caucasian looks.

364
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:40,529
Do you know the fashion magazine called Annnon?

365
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:43,729
I'm on the pages sometimes.

366
00:18:43,729 --> 00:18:45,329
Confirm it later, will you?

367
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:46,729
Yes, sir.

368
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:49,129
I'm...

369
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:53,429
It... it's not that I was hiding in the toilet either.

370
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:55,829
I was troubled about a student of mine, so...

371
00:18:55,829 --> 00:18:56,829
A student?

372
00:18:56,829 --> 00:18:58,929
Oh, I'm working as an English teacher

373
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,929
at a prep school near here.

374
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:05,729
I fell in love with one of the students there,

375
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:06,829
so I was planning to call her over to the restaurant on the top floor

376
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:09,329
and came here.

377
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:10,829
But, when the time came to call her,

378
00:19:10,829 --> 00:19:12,429
I couldn't think of what to say.

379
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:15,129
That's why when came out of the toilet, you're looking pale.

380
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:16,329
Yes.

381
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:18,229
When I'm worried, I like to be alone.

382
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:24,629
Now, what were you doing

383
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:25,929
running down the stairs perspiring profusely?

384
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:29,629
Can't you tell? I was training.

385
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:32,129
The height and the length of the stairs in this hotel

386
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,029
is just great for training.

387
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:37,929
I can't afford getting out of shape, in the line of work I do.

388
00:19:39,629 --> 00:19:42,229
I used to come here in the past when I found the time.

389
00:19:42,229 --> 00:19:43,429
In the past?

390
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:44,429
Yes.

391
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:47,129
I found it when I came to Japan two years ago.

392
00:19:47,129 --> 00:19:49,729
You know the juice that they have at the restaurant on the top floor.

393
00:19:49,729 --> 00:19:51,529
The special fruit juice.

394
00:19:52,629 --> 00:19:55,929
I just couldn't forget how delicious it is to drink after training.

395
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:56,929
So, I had a glass today too.

396
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:01,929
So, what line of work are you in?

397
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:03,229
Huh?

398
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:07,829
If it's a job that requires you to keep in shape,

399
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:08,829
are you a Pro Wrestler?

400
00:20:08,829 --> 00:20:10,329
Oh, no...

401
00:20:10,329 --> 00:20:13,329
There's only one reason you can't tell us about it.

402
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:17,929
That's because your job is killing.

403
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:19,529
What?

404
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:20,929
Hey...

405
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,629
You're keeping your body in shape,

406
00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:26,629
so that you can swiftly corner your target.

407
00:20:26,629 --> 00:20:28,129
I'm sure that the scratch on his face

408
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:30,329
is one that he got when his target fought back at him.

409
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,129
No, this scratch is...

410
00:20:32,129 --> 00:20:33,429
Not only your scratch.

411
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:36,429
But, we're saying that your face is...

412
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:38,929
one of a murderer.

413
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:42,029
Well, it's obvious that you're not a tourist, right?

414
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:47,529
I don't think anyone would train themselves

415
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:49,129
when on a trip.

416
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:50,929
Oh, but he is...

417
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:53,329
Hey, what's this? Do you know him?

418
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:56,129
-Huh? -Is it true, Conan?

419
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:59,029
Don't tell me he's wanted internationally?

420
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:00,729
I just know he's a bad guy, right?

421
00:21:00,729 --> 00:21:03,529
Yep, because a good person doesn't hide anything!

422
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,229
Oh, well, you see...

423
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:07,529
It's just as the children say.

424
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:10,529
If you have nothing to feel guilty about, tell us, will you?

425
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:13,229
What kind of work do you do?

426
00:21:17,629 --> 00:21:19,829
I've got no choice.

427
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:22,629
"Haido Central Hospital" -Huh?

428
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:24,429
Camel's being suspected

429
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:26,229
as one of the suspects of a murder case?

430
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:31,029
Yep, he seems to have been training on the stairs

431
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:32,929
where the murder occurred.

432
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:35,229
Training using the stairs of a hotel?

433
00:21:36,229 --> 00:21:39,429
I guess he would since he's a muscle training fanatic.

434
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:41,529
He did the same thing two years ago too.

435
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:43,229
Come to think of it,

436
00:21:43,229 --> 00:21:45,829
it seems he came to Japan two years ago too.

437
00:21:45,829 --> 00:21:47,629
Did something come up?

438
00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:50,229
No, nothing really.

439
00:21:50,229 --> 00:21:54,229
Never mind that, will you hurry and help him get out of trouble.

440
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:58,029
You're going to the hotel now, aren't you?

441
00:21:58,029 --> 00:21:59,629
Yes.

442
00:21:59,629 --> 00:22:00,829
Make sure that you don't give away the fact

443
00:22:00,829 --> 00:22:05,329
that the FBI are here in Japan for top-secret investigation.

444
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:07,129
Yes, sir. Of course.

445
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:10,129
Okay, Conan, I'll be right over.

446
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:11,829
Bye, see you later.

447
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:13,529
Oh, Jodie.

448
00:22:16,129 --> 00:22:17,329
Be careful.

449
00:22:19,229 --> 00:22:22,429
I have this bad feeling today.

450
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:26,129
Oh, it's Friday the 13th, right?

451
00:22:28,329 --> 00:22:31,929
I don't really go for things like that.

452
00:22:33,229 --> 00:22:36,129
Really?

453
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,340
Next Conan's Hint:

454
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,640
English Pronunciation.
