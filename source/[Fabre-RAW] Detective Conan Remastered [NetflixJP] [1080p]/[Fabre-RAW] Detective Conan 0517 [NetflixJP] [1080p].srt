1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,120
The start of the age of mystery.

2
00:00:06,744 --> 00:00:08,644
The mystery of the Fuurinkazan.

3
00:00:08,644 --> 00:00:10,744
Conan and Heiji come to the conclusion!

4
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,344
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:12,344 --> 00:00:14,144
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:14,144 --> 00:00:16,544
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

7
00:01:52,344 --> 00:01:54,244
The feuding Torada and Tatsuo families

8
00:01:54,244 --> 00:01:56,644
are involved in a case of serial murders.

9
00:01:57,444 --> 00:01:59,244
The crimes are being patterned after

10
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,244
Takeda Shingen's military strategy, the "Fuurinkazan".

11
00:02:03,844 --> 00:02:07,444
Why is this culprit so obsessed with Shingen?

12
00:02:07,444 --> 00:02:09,244
And what is the connection

13
00:02:09,244 --> 00:02:12,744
with the falling death of Police Officer Kuroto Kai six years ago?

14
00:02:12,744 --> 00:02:16,144
As the mystery deepens, another victim is found.

15
00:02:18,844 --> 00:02:24,744
"Fuurinkazan: The Conclusion in Lightning and Shadow"

16
00:02:25,744 --> 00:02:28,244
The body is badly burnt,

17
00:02:28,244 --> 00:02:29,444
but judging from the body shape,

18
00:02:29,444 --> 00:02:32,144
I'm certain this is Shigetsugu Torada.

19
00:02:32,144 --> 00:02:34,144
The Tatsuo family's to blame!

20
00:02:34,144 --> 00:02:36,144
What nonsense.

21
00:02:36,144 --> 00:02:39,344
By the way, where is the fishing pole?

22
00:02:39,344 --> 00:02:40,344
Fishing pole?

23
00:02:40,344 --> 00:02:42,844
Yes. He had it in a case.

24
00:02:42,844 --> 00:02:45,044
But I'm sure it was a fishing pole.

25
00:02:46,444 --> 00:02:48,344
Are you saying that...

26
00:02:48,344 --> 00:02:49,944
That's right!

27
00:02:49,944 --> 00:02:55,744
Shigetsugu touched the railway cables and got electrocuted!

28
00:02:55,744 --> 00:02:58,144
Where did you find that?

29
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:00,644
Just there in the forest!

30
00:03:00,644 --> 00:03:04,744
The case of the pole was near the crossing.

31
00:03:04,744 --> 00:03:07,644
So I think he got electrocuted there,

32
00:03:07,644 --> 00:03:12,044
and got hit by the train and ended up here

33
00:03:12,044 --> 00:03:16,544
and there was a dead centipede near the case too.

34
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:19,844
This is another serial murder!

35
00:03:19,844 --> 00:03:22,244
Yoshirou Torada who was killed in a tornado,

36
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,644
"wind."

37
00:03:23,644 --> 00:03:27,044
Koji Tatsuo who was buried in the ground and beaten to death,

38
00:03:27,044 --> 00:03:28,844
"mountain."

39
00:03:28,844 --> 00:03:31,144
Ayaka Tatsuo who was hanged in the forest,

40
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,544
"forest"

41
00:03:33,244 --> 00:03:34,844
And Shigetsugu Torada

42
00:03:34,844 --> 00:03:37,844
who was burned completely with electrical shock,

43
00:03:37,844 --> 00:03:39,344
"fire."

44
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:43,544
The "Fuurinkazan" message has been completed!

45
00:03:43,544 --> 00:03:46,344
But why did my wife and my friends

46
00:03:46,344 --> 00:03:48,544
have to be killed in such a way?

47
00:03:48,544 --> 00:03:51,144
Mr. Yamato! I found a strange memo.

48
00:03:52,944 --> 00:03:54,344
This is...

49
00:03:54,344 --> 00:03:55,444
It seems like the progress they made

50
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,744
in finding the buried gold is written here.

51
00:03:57,744 --> 00:04:02,444
Isn't that the memo that Shigetsugu was looking for?

52
00:04:02,444 --> 00:04:07,544
Yes and it was also used to exchange notes among themselves.

53
00:04:07,544 --> 00:04:10,244
In short, the notebook says that...

54
00:04:10,244 --> 00:04:14,544
Six years ago, they accidentally caused someone's death

55
00:04:14,544 --> 00:04:17,544
and they were talking about whether to go to the police or not.

56
00:04:17,544 --> 00:04:19,744
But decided not to in the end.

57
00:04:19,744 --> 00:04:22,944
And they've remained silent ever since.

58
00:04:22,944 --> 00:04:26,244
Mr. Akira Tatsuo, they did it for your sake.

59
00:04:26,244 --> 00:04:28,744
-What? -Wait!

60
00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:31,544
You mean the person who died six years ago is...

61
00:04:31,544 --> 00:04:32,844
Yes.

62
00:04:32,844 --> 00:04:35,244
It was Kai Kuroto.

63
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,444
They did it so that you could win in the preliminaries

64
00:04:39,444 --> 00:04:41,544
and be chosen as the horseback archer.

65
00:04:41,544 --> 00:04:44,544
They wanted Kai Kuroto to be injured.

66
00:04:44,544 --> 00:04:47,444
They used fireworks to frighten his horse while he was practicing,

67
00:04:47,444 --> 00:04:49,444
hoping he would be thrown off the horse.

68
00:04:49,444 --> 00:04:51,244
But the horse became more frightened than they thought,

69
00:04:51,244 --> 00:04:52,744
and it started to run.

70
00:04:52,744 --> 00:04:54,144
It says that

71
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:57,844
they found Kai Kuroto along with his horse, under the cliff.

72
00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:00,444
No...

73
00:05:00,444 --> 00:05:01,944
Judging by the handwritings in this memo,

74
00:05:01,944 --> 00:05:04,144
there were four people involved.

75
00:05:04,144 --> 00:05:08,544
I believe they are Yoshiro and Shigetsugu from the Torada family.

76
00:05:08,544 --> 00:05:10,144
And Koji and Ayaka from the Tatsuo family.

77
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:11,544
The four victims of this serial murder case.

78
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:15,944
But why would the memo end up here?

79
00:05:15,944 --> 00:05:19,344
To hide the evidence they had.

80
00:05:19,344 --> 00:05:22,144
Shigetsugu was pretending to look for this memo,

81
00:05:22,144 --> 00:05:24,144
when he already had it.

82
00:05:24,144 --> 00:05:26,244
And intended to burn himself

83
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:29,144
with the memo to apologize to Kai Kuroto.

84
00:05:29,144 --> 00:05:32,344
Then, you're saying this string of murders was...

85
00:05:32,344 --> 00:05:35,144
Yes. After taking care of his partners in crime

86
00:05:35,144 --> 00:05:37,244
in the incident six years ago,

87
00:05:37,244 --> 00:05:43,244
he took his life in order to conceal the truth forever.

88
00:05:43,244 --> 00:05:46,444
Shigetsugu Torada is the serial killer!

89
00:05:46,444 --> 00:05:48,544
And he tried to burn the memo, too,

90
00:05:48,544 --> 00:05:52,144
to hide the truth from Akira Tatsuo!

91
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:56,144
Well, the memo wasn't burnt after all.

92
00:05:56,144 --> 00:05:59,144
But even if it was for Akira...

93
00:05:59,144 --> 00:06:03,044
I know Kai Kuroto would straightened them out on the other side.

94
00:06:03,044 --> 00:06:05,844
I know he will.

95
00:06:07,244 --> 00:06:09,644
Well, this case is closed!

96
00:06:09,644 --> 00:06:13,344
I would like to tell you all to go home,

97
00:06:13,344 --> 00:06:14,744
but I have to search your houses

98
00:06:14,744 --> 00:06:16,244
to gather up some proof for this case.

99
00:06:16,244 --> 00:06:18,444
I would have to ask you to stay here.

100
00:06:21,744 --> 00:06:25,844
Hey, do you really think that Shigetsugu found the memo?

101
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:29,844
I don't know. He didn't seem like he had it.

102
00:06:29,844 --> 00:06:31,744
But he stopped looking for it

103
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:33,944
and started to check his emails.

104
00:06:33,944 --> 00:06:35,944
So maybe he did.

105
00:06:35,944 --> 00:06:37,344
Email?

106
00:06:38,144 --> 00:06:40,544
Oh, yeah.

107
00:06:40,544 --> 00:06:42,744
Just when we were about to leave.

108
00:06:42,744 --> 00:06:43,944
Email...

109
00:06:43,944 --> 00:06:45,244
Heiji!

110
00:06:46,644 --> 00:06:49,344
What's up? Did you find something?

111
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,644
Look at this.

112
00:06:53,844 --> 00:06:56,244
A rock with a piece of string.

113
00:06:56,244 --> 00:07:00,444
The memo had the same kind of string on it too.

114
00:07:00,444 --> 00:07:02,644
Hey! We are all done here!

115
00:07:02,644 --> 00:07:05,044
The case is closed!

116
00:07:05,044 --> 00:07:07,744
With the "fire" that burned Shigetsugu!

117
00:07:07,744 --> 00:07:09,144
It's "lightning".

118
00:07:12,744 --> 00:07:16,444
You hear that? I think it might start to rain.

119
00:07:16,444 --> 00:07:17,744
Lightning?

120
00:07:17,744 --> 00:07:20,044
Lightning.

121
00:07:20,044 --> 00:07:24,244
Oh my, how long do we have to wait here in the rain?

122
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:29,744
Do you remember the weather the day that Kai Kuroto died?

123
00:07:29,744 --> 00:07:32,344
My husband had bad dreams.

124
00:07:32,344 --> 00:07:34,844
He said "The sound. the light."

125
00:07:34,844 --> 00:07:37,044
Do you think it's about thunder?

126
00:07:37,044 --> 00:07:39,544
No. I think it was sunny that day.

127
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:41,944
All day long.

128
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:45,144
My poor Shigetsugu will be in the rain.

129
00:07:45,144 --> 00:07:48,344
Heiji, can't we do anything?

130
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:49,744
And he's gone!

131
00:07:49,744 --> 00:07:51,244
Conan, too!

132
00:07:51,244 --> 00:07:53,444
There they go again.

133
00:07:54,144 --> 00:07:57,044
Where Ayaka was hanged,

134
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,144
there were no footprints.

135
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:03,244
All that was left were the footprints of

136
00:08:03,244 --> 00:08:07,944
police detective Yamato and the marks of his cane.

137
00:08:07,944 --> 00:08:11,344
I wonder when they hanged Ayaka?

138
00:08:11,344 --> 00:08:13,844
The Torada family was with us

139
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:17,244
until Ayaka disappeared from the bathroom.

140
00:08:17,244 --> 00:08:20,944
The Tatsuo family was in the car,

141
00:08:20,944 --> 00:08:22,744
with Tamefumi Tatsuo driving.

142
00:08:22,744 --> 00:08:24,544
Hey, you two!

143
00:08:24,544 --> 00:08:26,844
What are you doing here?

144
00:08:26,844 --> 00:08:29,044
Oh, you're the detective we saw earlier.

145
00:08:29,044 --> 00:08:30,444
What's going on?

146
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:33,144
Mr. Yamato ordered us to preserve the murder scene

147
00:08:33,144 --> 00:08:35,244
since it might start raining soon!

148
00:08:35,244 --> 00:08:37,144
What is that coat?

149
00:08:37,144 --> 00:08:38,144
Oh, this?

150
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:41,144
I found it caught in the branch of a tree!

151
00:08:41,144 --> 00:08:42,844
Is that coat...

152
00:08:42,844 --> 00:08:44,244
Wet by any chance?

153
00:08:44,244 --> 00:08:46,844
No. Mr. Yamato asked me the same thing.

154
00:08:46,844 --> 00:08:48,144
But it's not.

155
00:08:50,244 --> 00:08:52,544
Well, we have to move quickly!

156
00:08:52,544 --> 00:08:54,544
Since he's back to work,

157
00:08:54,544 --> 00:08:57,144
we have no time to rest at all!

158
00:08:57,144 --> 00:08:59,644
Where was he until now?

159
00:08:59,644 --> 00:09:03,244
He was after a man who escaped during parole

160
00:09:03,244 --> 00:09:05,744
and got caught in an avalanche.

161
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:09,544
The man was arrested by Kai Kuroto

162
00:09:09,544 --> 00:09:12,544
and disappeared six years ago,

163
00:09:12,544 --> 00:09:13,544
so Mr. Yamato thought

164
00:09:13,544 --> 00:09:16,744
he might be linked to the death of Kai Kuroto.

165
00:09:16,744 --> 00:09:20,544
In the accident, he lost his left eye and left leg,

166
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:24,244
and was unconscious in the hospital for a long time.

167
00:09:24,244 --> 00:09:27,844
So was the man connected to Kai Kuroto's death?

168
00:09:27,844 --> 00:09:30,644
Unfortunately, he wasn't.

169
00:09:31,344 --> 00:09:34,044
But fate is definitely cruel.

170
00:09:34,044 --> 00:09:37,344
He had to meet Yui Uehara as the victim's wife,

171
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:38,544
when she used to work under Mr. Yamato

172
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,644
before he was hospitalized.

173
00:09:40,644 --> 00:09:42,944
Yui and he were determined

174
00:09:42,944 --> 00:09:46,844
to find the truth behind Kai Kuroto's death.

175
00:09:46,844 --> 00:09:49,744
But she quit the force and got married.

176
00:09:50,744 --> 00:09:52,744
Those two became police officers

177
00:09:52,744 --> 00:09:55,244
to follow in the path of Kai Kuroto.

178
00:09:55,244 --> 00:09:59,244
Then, six years ago when Kai Kuroto died,

179
00:09:59,244 --> 00:10:01,344
-was she still in the force? -Yes, she was.

180
00:10:01,344 --> 00:10:03,544
She had just joined the force,

181
00:10:03,544 --> 00:10:06,644
and she was in such shock, crying a lot.

182
00:10:06,644 --> 00:10:10,644
Speaking of tears, there was something odd.

183
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:11,644
What is it?

184
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:14,444
There should have been tear marks on Ayala Tatsuo's face

185
00:10:14,444 --> 00:10:16,044
before she died,

186
00:10:16,044 --> 00:10:18,044
but we couldn't find any.

187
00:10:18,044 --> 00:10:20,944
How could you tell that she wiped her tears?

188
00:10:20,944 --> 00:10:23,044
Her eye shadow had rubbed off,

189
00:10:23,044 --> 00:10:25,844
and her right index finger had eye shadow on it.

190
00:10:25,844 --> 00:10:28,444
She must have wiped her tears.

191
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:30,244
What color was it?

192
00:10:30,244 --> 00:10:32,944
-Tell us! -Well,

193
00:10:32,944 --> 00:10:35,844
it was ordinary blue eye shadow.

194
00:10:37,544 --> 00:10:41,944
Then take that horse and go home to the Torada family!

195
00:10:41,944 --> 00:10:43,344
I see.

196
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:44,744
It must be.

197
00:10:47,244 --> 00:10:49,544
It seems like this battle...

198
00:10:49,544 --> 00:10:51,744
Isn't over yet.

199
00:11:00,246 --> 00:11:02,146
"Torada Residence" -What? The police

200
00:11:02,146 --> 00:11:04,346
"Torada Residence" -will come to this house again?

201
00:11:04,346 --> 00:11:07,646
Yes. Mr. Yamato will bring some people

202
00:11:07,646 --> 00:11:09,646
and will search the house.

203
00:11:09,646 --> 00:11:12,946
They plan a house search on the Tatsuo family house as well!

204
00:11:12,946 --> 00:11:14,946
How long will it take?

205
00:11:14,946 --> 00:11:17,246
He said about three to four days.

206
00:11:17,246 --> 00:11:19,346
Three to four days?

207
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,846
I think the festival starts in three days.

208
00:11:22,846 --> 00:11:25,546
Yeah, I know.

209
00:11:25,546 --> 00:11:26,946
I see now.

210
00:11:26,946 --> 00:11:28,446
The festival?

211
00:11:28,446 --> 00:11:30,746
"Tatsuo Residence"

212
00:11:33,146 --> 00:11:34,946
Yoshiro.

213
00:11:34,946 --> 00:11:36,546
Koji.

214
00:11:36,546 --> 00:11:39,546
Ayaka. Shigetsugu.

215
00:11:39,546 --> 00:11:43,146
Why did you do such a thing to Mr. Kuroto

216
00:11:43,146 --> 00:11:44,346
just because of me?

217
00:11:49,346 --> 00:11:52,846
It was you.

218
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:55,746
Yui Torada.

219
00:11:55,746 --> 00:11:59,746
So you knew that I was coming?

220
00:11:59,746 --> 00:12:03,446
Yes. When Shigetsugu died, you said "lightning".

221
00:12:03,446 --> 00:12:05,546
That's how I knew.

222
00:12:05,546 --> 00:12:10,146
Although his body was burnt, it was from the electricity.

223
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:15,346
It was the "thunderbolt" from "Move like thunderbolt".

224
00:12:15,346 --> 00:12:16,546
That's right.

225
00:12:16,546 --> 00:12:19,446
There's more to the "Fuurinkazan" strategy

226
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:21,346
that Sun Tzu wrote about.

227
00:12:21,346 --> 00:12:24,946
There is "Move like thunderbolt" which you just said,

228
00:12:24,946 --> 00:12:29,346
and there also is "be impenetratable as shadow"

229
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:31,046
The "thunderbolt" suggests that

230
00:12:31,046 --> 00:12:34,746
you must "appear like thunderbolt, in a surprise."

231
00:12:34,746 --> 00:12:39,046
"Shadow" suggests you must "hide as still as shadow.".

232
00:12:39,046 --> 00:12:40,446
That's right.

233
00:12:40,446 --> 00:12:43,246
Just like Kai Kuroto, beneath the cliff

234
00:12:43,246 --> 00:12:47,246
where the sun didn't reach and still breathing and alive.

235
00:12:47,246 --> 00:12:50,946
To those four who caused Kuroto Kai's death six years ago,

236
00:12:50,946 --> 00:12:54,246
his blood soaked undershirt must have looked deep red.

237
00:12:54,246 --> 00:12:59,646
Just like the armor of Takeda's Akazonae cavalry.

238
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:02,146
That's why this was all patterned after Shingen!

239
00:13:02,146 --> 00:13:03,246
Yes.

240
00:13:03,246 --> 00:13:04,946
It was to make the four who brought Kuroto Kai's death

241
00:13:04,946 --> 00:13:06,946
come to the light.

242
00:13:06,946 --> 00:13:10,246
Just as expected, Koji reacted to it almost instantly.

243
00:13:10,246 --> 00:13:14,846
But Ayaka and Shigetsugu weren't that interested in Shingen.

244
00:13:14,846 --> 00:13:18,046
So they didn't respond to the dead centipedes.

245
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:21,246
And so, it was the uproar over the Suwa Hossyo helmet

246
00:13:21,246 --> 00:13:24,446
that finally got Ayaka.

247
00:13:24,446 --> 00:13:26,946
And then, Ayaka was forced to reveal Shigetsugu's name!

248
00:13:26,946 --> 00:13:29,046
Have you come to deal with me

249
00:13:29,046 --> 00:13:31,346
just like you did those four?

250
00:13:31,346 --> 00:13:33,846
To wipe out Kai Kuroto's enemy?

251
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,446
To wipe you out?

252
00:13:36,446 --> 00:13:38,146
No, Akira.

253
00:13:38,146 --> 00:13:40,946
I am here to protect you.

254
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:43,546
From the true killer...

255
00:13:43,546 --> 00:13:45,546
standing right over there.

256
00:13:48,446 --> 00:13:50,246
You!

257
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,946
I should have expected it from a former policewoman.

258
00:13:52,946 --> 00:13:55,046
How did you figure it out?

259
00:13:55,046 --> 00:13:58,546
It was the blue eye shadow on Ayaka's hand.

260
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,846
"Ao" from "Aokage" meaning black horse.

261
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:03,246
In other words,

262
00:14:03,246 --> 00:14:08,246
the person riding a black horse at that time, was you.

263
00:14:08,246 --> 00:14:10,346
What a clever girl.

264
00:14:10,346 --> 00:14:13,846
Then, you forced Shigetsugu's name out of Ayaka,

265
00:14:13,846 --> 00:14:15,346
and dealt with him.

266
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:19,246
Yes, Shigetsugu was the child of my husband's first wife.

267
00:14:19,246 --> 00:14:21,846
He wasn't related to me by blood.

268
00:14:21,846 --> 00:14:24,346
But why, Tatsue?

269
00:14:24,346 --> 00:14:28,646
It's because she is the one who really killed Kuroto Kai.

270
00:14:28,646 --> 00:14:29,746
I told you that

271
00:14:29,746 --> 00:14:31,446
my husband would say "the sound, the light"

272
00:14:31,446 --> 00:14:33,546
in his nightmares.

273
00:14:33,546 --> 00:14:35,946
That's what lead me to realize there was another person

274
00:14:35,946 --> 00:14:38,046
at the crime scene six years ago.

275
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:41,146
Tatsue, it was you, wasn't it?

276
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:44,546
Yes, I wanted him injured as well.

277
00:14:44,546 --> 00:14:48,146
So I fired one shot from this gun at his horse's legs.

278
00:14:48,146 --> 00:14:51,346
That's when he fell off the cliff.

279
00:14:51,346 --> 00:14:55,746
But, some people came and started making a big fuss.

280
00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:59,346
As if they were the ones who caused his death.

281
00:14:59,346 --> 00:15:01,346
That made me laugh.

282
00:15:01,346 --> 00:15:03,046
It would have been best if they continued to think that

283
00:15:03,046 --> 00:15:04,246
and kept their mouth shut.

284
00:15:04,246 --> 00:15:06,846
But later on, Yoshiro started talking about going to the police

285
00:15:06,846 --> 00:15:10,146
to tell about the gunshot he heard and the flash he's seen.

286
00:15:10,146 --> 00:15:14,946
But then the Gods punished him by sending him that tornado.

287
00:15:14,946 --> 00:15:18,446
And you left my injured husband there to die.

288
00:15:18,446 --> 00:15:21,146
Leaving the centipeds that you had ready.

289
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:24,546
Yes, by that time I'd already come up with

290
00:15:24,546 --> 00:15:27,546
the idea of patterning everything after the "Fuurinkazan-inrai".

291
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:33,546
That means one of your targets right from the start was Akira.

292
00:15:33,546 --> 00:15:34,546
What?

293
00:15:34,546 --> 00:15:37,546
Yes, the final element was for Akira, "fire".

294
00:15:37,546 --> 00:15:39,846
Since you've come in the way of the gambling operation we run,

295
00:15:39,846 --> 00:15:42,646
you'll be burned into ashes.

296
00:15:44,546 --> 00:15:47,146
These flames you eat you up!

297
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,546
Gambling?

298
00:15:48,546 --> 00:15:51,146
They gamble on the festival horseback archery contest,

299
00:15:51,146 --> 00:15:53,846
betting how many of misses there'll be in the ten shots.

300
00:15:53,846 --> 00:15:57,046
But Kai Kuroto never missed a single one.

301
00:15:57,046 --> 00:15:59,146
Until you moved one of the targets.

302
00:15:59,146 --> 00:16:02,446
There's no point in gambling if he never misses.

303
00:16:02,446 --> 00:16:04,546
And since you've hit them all for five years straight as well,

304
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,346
you'll need to die too.

305
00:16:06,346 --> 00:16:07,646
The story will be that

306
00:16:07,646 --> 00:16:09,646
you took revenge for Kai Kuroto, whom you loved dearly.

307
00:16:09,646 --> 00:16:11,446
And then to atone for those crimes,

308
00:16:11,446 --> 00:16:15,246
you took your own life.

309
00:16:15,246 --> 00:16:17,046
But considering the present circumstances,

310
00:16:17,046 --> 00:16:19,546
having this stupid woman,

311
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,246
to solve the mystery of Officer Kai Kuroto's death,

312
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:24,246
went so far as to marry Yoshiro, a man she didn't love.

313
00:16:24,246 --> 00:16:26,546
It might look better if we changed out story to one

314
00:16:26,546 --> 00:16:29,246
where she kills you out of resentment.

315
00:16:29,246 --> 00:16:32,646
Well, will you tell this stupid woman something?

316
00:16:32,646 --> 00:16:34,946
Why were there no marks

317
00:16:34,946 --> 00:16:38,146
beneath the tree where Ayaka was hanged?

318
00:16:38,146 --> 00:16:40,946
There is nothing to tell to one who will die!

319
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:42,246
It's the horse!

320
00:16:45,746 --> 00:16:48,946
Back then, you put Ayaka on your horse, didn't you?

321
00:16:48,946 --> 00:16:52,046
You used a rope already attached to the branch beforehand.

322
00:16:52,046 --> 00:16:53,846
Allowing you to hook it to her neck

323
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,546
from the other side of the tree.

324
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:59,046
Afterwards, you rode your horse up behind the tree.

325
00:16:59,046 --> 00:17:00,846
So no one would know

326
00:17:00,846 --> 00:17:03,346
when the hoof marks had gotten there.

327
00:17:03,346 --> 00:17:05,246
How long have you been there?

328
00:17:05,246 --> 00:17:07,946
"Be as swift as the wind"

329
00:17:07,946 --> 00:17:11,646
I've been waiting here for two hours before you came.

330
00:17:11,646 --> 00:17:14,646
Incidentally, the reason no one noticed that

331
00:17:14,646 --> 00:17:17,846
Ayaka was on your horse was...

332
00:17:17,846 --> 00:17:20,846
You had a black coat on her.

333
00:17:20,846 --> 00:17:22,746
When Ayaka was secluded in the toilet,

334
00:17:22,746 --> 00:17:23,746
you called her on her cell phone

335
00:17:23,746 --> 00:17:25,846
and secretly lured her out to the stables.

336
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:28,346
After Akira and the others left on the horse...

337
00:17:28,346 --> 00:17:30,046
You placed her, with that black coat on her,

338
00:17:30,046 --> 00:17:32,846
on your black horse and went into the forest.

339
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:35,846
You! How did you!

340
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,746
"Be quiet as the forest."

341
00:17:38,746 --> 00:17:41,046
I've been waiting here. Holding my breath.

342
00:17:41,046 --> 00:17:44,046
Well, it looks like there was an earlier visitor here before us.

343
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:46,546
An early visitor?

344
00:17:46,546 --> 00:17:48,846
If you know your target,

345
00:17:48,846 --> 00:17:51,646
be cool and level.

346
00:17:52,646 --> 00:17:56,446
Sit yourself down and observe.

347
00:17:59,046 --> 00:18:02,646
"Be immovable like the mountain"

348
00:18:05,146 --> 00:18:07,546
You planned this, didn't you?

349
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:11,046
Yeah, with the police sticking around here until the festival,

350
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:13,646
tonight was your only chance.

351
00:18:13,646 --> 00:18:16,646
Compared to your plan of swiping that notebook,

352
00:18:16,646 --> 00:18:20,046
hanging it from the electric wires as bait.

353
00:18:20,046 --> 00:18:23,346
And electrocuting Shigetsugu, my plan was no big deal.

354
00:18:24,046 --> 00:18:27,446
The way you used a string to tie the notebook to a rock.

355
00:18:27,446 --> 00:18:30,946
Making it easy to throw it up to get it caught on the train cable.

356
00:18:30,946 --> 00:18:34,346
Shigetsugu learned where it was from an email you sent to him.

357
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:37,846
And when he used the pole to get it, he was electrocuted.

358
00:18:39,346 --> 00:18:41,746
Well, if you want to light a fire, go ahead.

359
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,046
I've already called the fire department

360
00:18:43,046 --> 00:18:45,046
and have them waiting on standby.

361
00:18:47,046 --> 00:18:48,546
Get them!

362
00:18:58,746 --> 00:19:01,146
Don't worry, I'm striking with the blunt side!

363
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:07,346
You brat!

364
00:19:09,546 --> 00:19:11,546
-Kansuke! -Take this!

365
00:19:18,046 --> 00:19:21,746
Saving the best for you again, huh?

366
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:23,946
And that's how the final murder

367
00:19:23,946 --> 00:19:25,746
was prevented before it happened.

368
00:19:25,746 --> 00:19:28,346
As for the war that had lasted for six years,

369
00:19:28,346 --> 00:19:32,246
it was over at last, leaving a bruise on the eye of the enemy.

370
00:19:35,346 --> 00:19:36,446
What?

371
00:19:36,446 --> 00:19:39,946
You fought against the culprits last night?

372
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:42,146
Why didn't you ask us to help?

373
00:19:42,146 --> 00:19:44,346
We could have helped!

374
00:19:44,346 --> 00:19:48,546
Hey, I can't let you guys do such a dangerous thing like that!

375
00:19:48,546 --> 00:19:52,046
Then, I will have you come in for an interview.

376
00:19:52,046 --> 00:19:54,246
I see. Good day.

377
00:19:55,246 --> 00:19:58,746
You too! You better come to the police!

378
00:19:58,746 --> 00:20:00,146
Yes. I will.

379
00:20:00,146 --> 00:20:01,946
See ya.

380
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:09,546
"Be swift as the wind."

381
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:14,246
I...

382
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,446
Pardon?

383
00:20:16,946 --> 00:20:19,946
It was because I thought you were dead, Kansuke!

384
00:20:19,946 --> 00:20:23,446
That's why I thought I had to do something.

385
00:20:23,446 --> 00:20:26,946
That's why I married Yoshiro...

386
00:20:26,946 --> 00:20:31,646
But, when I say that, it makes me feel sorry for my husband.

387
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:33,846
Idiot, didn't I just say it?

388
00:20:33,846 --> 00:20:36,946
"Come to the police."

389
00:20:36,946 --> 00:20:38,946
When you free yourself from your obligations,

390
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:42,246
and when you're ready. Come back.

391
00:20:42,246 --> 00:20:44,246
The chief detective has been waiting, too.

392
00:20:44,246 --> 00:20:47,546
For that awful coffee that you make.

393
00:20:54,846 --> 00:20:57,346
Hey, those two...

394
00:20:57,346 --> 00:20:59,146
Are getting along!

395
00:21:00,146 --> 00:21:03,046
Hey, what were they saying?

396
00:21:03,046 --> 00:21:04,846
You were near them, right?

397
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:08,946
She said "Be swift as the wind" or something.

398
00:21:08,946 --> 00:21:11,246
This should be the strategy of love!

399
00:21:11,246 --> 00:21:12,646
"Fuurinkazan"!

400
00:22:34,246 --> 00:22:35,246
Heiji!

401
00:22:36,946 --> 00:22:39,346
-What is it, Kazuha? -Just come with me!

402
00:22:39,346 --> 00:22:40,646
What's going on?

403
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,746
Oh no, it's Ran.

404
00:22:46,746 --> 00:22:49,046
Hello? Shinichi?

405
00:22:49,046 --> 00:22:52,046
Oh, hey Ran, what's going on?

406
00:22:52,046 --> 00:22:53,746
What is it?

407
00:22:53,746 --> 00:22:56,846
Today, I am going to make myself clear!

408
00:22:56,846 --> 00:23:00,546
-Couldn't we talk later? -No! It has to be now!

409
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,846
"Be swift as the wind."

410
00:23:02,846 --> 00:23:05,246
Hey, let me go to the bathroom.

411
00:23:05,246 --> 00:23:07,946
Nope! You are not going anywhere, Heiji!

412
00:23:07,946 --> 00:23:10,146
"Attack as fiercely as the fire."

413
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:21,546
"Be as quiet as the forest."

414
00:23:22,546 --> 00:23:25,546
Well... yeah, we can talk later...

415
00:23:26,846 --> 00:23:30,546
Well... I'll let you go for today.

416
00:23:30,546 --> 00:23:32,246
Hey, wait a second!

417
00:23:37,346 --> 00:23:38,846
What's up with them?

418
00:23:38,846 --> 00:23:40,146
I don't know.

419
00:23:40,146 --> 00:23:42,746
You think they're getting irritated because they're hungry?

420
00:23:45,846 --> 00:23:49,046
"Be immovable like the mountain."

421
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,400
Next Conan's Hint:

422
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,280
"Fox"
