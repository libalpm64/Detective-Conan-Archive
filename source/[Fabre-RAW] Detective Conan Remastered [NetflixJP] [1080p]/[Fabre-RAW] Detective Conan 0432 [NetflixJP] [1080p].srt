1
00:00:01,871 --> 00:00:03,671
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:05,471
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:05,471 --> 00:00:07,071
Too absorbed in solving the case.

4
00:00:07,071 --> 00:00:08,671
The incident and love affair take an unexpected turn.

5
00:00:08,671 --> 00:00:10,571
Will you be able to do your thing today, Officer Takagi?

6
00:00:10,571 --> 00:00:12,071
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,071 --> 00:00:13,771
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:15,471
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,238 --> 00:01:59,938
We coincidentally run into Officer Takagi and Officer Chiba

10
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:02,538
who were attending a social gathering.

11
00:02:02,538 --> 00:02:05,338
However, in the midst of the gathering,

12
00:02:05,338 --> 00:02:08,338
the cousin of one of the participants, Kouta, was kidnapped.

13
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,838
The kidnapper demands...

14
00:02:11,838 --> 00:02:13,038
a million yen.

15
00:02:14,438 --> 00:02:20,338
"Love Story at Headquarters 7 (Part 2)"

16
00:02:21,638 --> 00:02:24,138
Ransom of a million yen.

17
00:02:24,138 --> 00:02:27,138
Quite a small amount considering the outrageousness of the crime.

18
00:02:27,138 --> 00:02:30,638
Yes. The culprit seems to be friends with Masashi

19
00:02:30,638 --> 00:02:33,338
and he's probably taking his real financial situation into consideration.

20
00:02:33,338 --> 00:02:34,738
Okay, got it.

21
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:38,438
I'll have investigators stakeout those three people's homes.

22
00:02:38,438 --> 00:02:42,138
Kouta saw the live baseball game on March 26th.

23
00:02:42,138 --> 00:02:44,538
The games during this time is either high school baseball

24
00:02:44,538 --> 00:02:46,338
or the opening of professional baseball.

25
00:02:46,338 --> 00:02:50,638
If we can figure out which game it was he referred to as boring that day,

26
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:53,238
we can probably figure out who the culprit by thinking out the time.

27
00:02:53,238 --> 00:02:55,638
Yes, all right.

28
00:02:55,638 --> 00:02:57,938
Officer Sato, I got it.

29
00:02:57,938 --> 00:03:01,238
There was no professional baseball opening game that day,

30
00:03:01,238 --> 00:03:03,038
but there were three high school games.

31
00:03:03,038 --> 00:03:05,438
Then which of the three is it?

32
00:03:05,438 --> 00:03:08,438
The score of the first game was 7 to 6.

33
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,738
This was a hot game with one come from behind victory after the other.

34
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:13,438
They played 12 extended games,

35
00:03:13,438 --> 00:03:16,938
which took from 10am till 2pm.

36
00:03:16,938 --> 00:03:19,338
The game is far from boring, is it?

37
00:03:19,338 --> 00:03:21,038
I don't think so either.

38
00:03:21,038 --> 00:03:23,738
The 2nd game ended...

39
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:25,138
at 4:30pm.

40
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,538
The score was 14 to 5.

41
00:03:26,538 --> 00:03:29,638
One of the teams made one hit after the other and won a fantastic game.

42
00:03:29,638 --> 00:03:33,438
It could be that game, because it's so one-sided and boring.

43
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:35,438
But the losing school

44
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:37,638
had a player who's gotten the attention of the professional leagues

45
00:03:37,638 --> 00:03:39,938
who was at bats six times, hit six singles and two homeruns.

46
00:03:39,938 --> 00:03:41,838
He's a great player.

47
00:03:41,838 --> 00:03:42,838
What about the last one?

48
00:03:42,838 --> 00:03:45,238
A competition of pitchers of a game scoring 1 to 2.

49
00:03:45,238 --> 00:03:47,638
Both teams make it out of a pinch time and again.

50
00:03:47,638 --> 00:03:50,938
Then in the bottom of the 9th inning, it is a game-ending homer.

51
00:03:50,938 --> 00:03:53,838
The game ended at exactly 7:00pm.

52
00:03:53,838 --> 00:03:56,438
This game is also interesting enough.

53
00:03:56,438 --> 00:04:00,238
Maybe he was watching a baseball game

54
00:04:00,238 --> 00:04:02,838
on a competing program in the same time slot?

55
00:04:02,838 --> 00:04:06,338
You know, like on cable television and satellite broadcasts.

56
00:04:06,338 --> 00:04:08,538
That's true.

57
00:04:08,538 --> 00:04:12,338
Between 12pm to 1pm, there was a game on satellite broadcast.

58
00:04:12,338 --> 00:04:14,238
A digest of a major league game.

59
00:04:14,238 --> 00:04:18,238
From 3pm to 5pm was the "Falcons Road to Victory".

60
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,438
A re-run of last year's program on Nichiuri TV.

61
00:04:21,438 --> 00:04:25,938
And on cable TV between 6pm to 7pm, was a special of player Kiyomatsu.

62
00:04:27,338 --> 00:04:30,038
There's no way that the "Nice Game Selection" would be boring.

63
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:34,038
And "The Road to Victory" sounds like it should be interesting as it is.

64
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:37,838
Then could it be player Kiyomatsu's talk show?

65
00:04:37,838 --> 00:04:40,138
Mother was watching that program.

66
00:04:40,138 --> 00:04:43,538
It showed all of player Kiyomatsu's homeruns since his debut

67
00:04:43,538 --> 00:04:45,838
and she said it was really good.

68
00:04:45,838 --> 00:04:49,138
Then the only thing left is video tape.

69
00:04:49,138 --> 00:04:51,838
The only thing thinkable is that he was watching video taped baseball game.

70
00:04:51,838 --> 00:04:53,838
I don't think so.

71
00:04:53,838 --> 00:04:55,538
Kouta told me that he turned the television on himself

72
00:04:55,538 --> 00:04:57,838
with the remote controller.

73
00:04:57,838 --> 00:05:01,838
In that case, maybe anticipating that Kouta would do that,

74
00:05:01,838 --> 00:05:05,038
the culprit setup an unrelated baseball video earlier.

75
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,838
To hide what time it was.

76
00:05:06,838 --> 00:05:08,138
Don't be silly.

77
00:05:08,138 --> 00:05:10,738
Kouta's the one who's using the remote controller.

78
00:05:10,738 --> 00:05:13,338
He would find out as soon as he changes the channel.

79
00:05:13,338 --> 00:05:15,638
True.

80
00:05:15,638 --> 00:05:21,438
Are you sure Kouta didn't tell you what time he went to the man's house?

81
00:05:21,438 --> 00:05:25,838
No. It seems that the man strongly told Kouta not to tell anyone.

82
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:29,138
We somehow managed to get him tell us about the card that he received

83
00:05:29,138 --> 00:05:31,338
as well as the fact that he was taken to the man's house.

84
00:05:31,338 --> 00:05:35,938
Well, if the card that Kouta received was a rare Masked Yaiba card,

85
00:05:35,938 --> 00:05:40,738
wouldn't Mr. Hikita, the modeler, be the most suspicious?

86
00:05:40,738 --> 00:05:47,538
No. It may be a rare card, but it's sold for about 3,000 yen at stores

87
00:05:47,538 --> 00:05:50,638
and can be bought by any adult.

88
00:05:50,638 --> 00:05:56,038
It's far from the premium card that's selling for 800,000 yen.

89
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:01,838
I remember that Mr. Hikiya said that he sent you a card set,

90
00:06:01,838 --> 00:06:05,738
but could a premium card have been inside the set?

91
00:06:05,738 --> 00:06:08,238
Like I already said, it wasn't there.

92
00:06:08,238 --> 00:06:13,538
Speaking of premium, Mr. Satsuka said he sent 30,000 yen to you by mail,

93
00:06:13,538 --> 00:06:16,638
but could bills with matching numbers have been inside?

94
00:06:16,638 --> 00:06:17,938
I wonder.

95
00:06:17,938 --> 00:06:21,938
I don't really bother looking at the numbers on bills.

96
00:06:21,938 --> 00:06:24,638
The same goes for the lottery tickets that Rokuda sent me.

97
00:06:24,638 --> 00:06:26,338
I'm not interested in stuff like that.

98
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,338
Yes, it could be movies.

99
00:06:29,338 --> 00:06:33,338
Maybe that baseball game was a scene in a movie or a drama?

100
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:35,638
Right. Could you check along that line?

101
00:06:35,638 --> 00:06:39,138
Yes. Movies and dramas on that day are...

102
00:06:39,138 --> 00:06:40,838
It's all love stories.

103
00:06:40,838 --> 00:06:42,538
"Extramarital Affairs are Great".

104
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:45,838
One about an aristocratic group date, "Lovers Who Don't Jive".

105
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:49,638
One about lovers separating, "Fleeting Spring".

106
00:06:49,638 --> 00:06:52,638
These are the programs that were aired that day.

107
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:55,438
I came for the food.

108
00:06:56,938 --> 00:06:58,738
I came not knowing it was going to be a social gathering.

109
00:06:58,738 --> 00:07:00,738
Unlike somebody I know.

110
00:07:00,738 --> 00:07:03,438
Well, you see...

111
00:07:03,438 --> 00:07:05,338
And what's with those clothes of yours?

112
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:06,938
Were you trying to show off?

113
00:07:06,938 --> 00:07:10,938
Talk for yourself, Officer Sato. What's with the makeup?

114
00:07:10,938 --> 00:07:12,138
This?

115
00:07:12,138 --> 00:07:13,838
Yumi forced me to put makeup on!

116
00:07:13,838 --> 00:07:15,238
Same with me!

117
00:07:15,238 --> 00:07:17,138
Officer Chiba forced me, too.

118
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:19,738
Although it's not important at this point.

119
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:22,738
Right. It's not important.

120
00:07:22,738 --> 00:07:25,538
Hey, what do you guys think you're doing?

121
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:30,038
Yes.

122
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:32,338
This is Megure. How are things?

123
00:07:32,338 --> 00:07:37,338
Well, we can't seem to locate any boring game that was aired that day.

124
00:07:37,338 --> 00:07:40,738
Hey. The officers are staking the houses of the three

125
00:07:40,738 --> 00:07:43,138
and ready to storm in at any time.

126
00:07:43,138 --> 00:07:45,838
The more time passes, the more the boy's life is in danger.

127
00:07:49,438 --> 00:07:50,638
I'm back!

128
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:53,438
Kouta?

129
00:07:55,338 --> 00:07:56,338
Are you all right?

130
00:07:56,338 --> 00:07:58,038
Are you hurt?

131
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:00,138
Yeah, I'm fine.

132
00:08:00,138 --> 00:08:02,638
I was riding in the car of the man that I met the other day,

133
00:08:02,638 --> 00:08:04,438
but I got tired and fell asleep.

134
00:08:04,438 --> 00:08:07,638
Where does he live? Where is his apartment?

135
00:08:07,638 --> 00:08:09,738
Who's this lady?

136
00:08:09,738 --> 00:08:10,838
She's a police officer.

137
00:08:10,838 --> 00:08:12,338
Please tell me, Kouta.

138
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:16,938
But I promised the man that I won't tell.

139
00:08:16,938 --> 00:08:20,238
That man is a bad man who kidnapped you,

140
00:08:20,238 --> 00:08:21,838
so please tell me!

141
00:08:21,838 --> 00:08:22,838
But...

142
00:08:24,138 --> 00:08:25,538
Who cares?

143
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,238
He's come home safely.

144
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:29,938
One of my friends played a prank after all.

145
00:08:29,938 --> 00:08:33,438
Though the prank was in bad taste.

146
00:08:33,438 --> 00:08:35,838
This is not something you can put aside as just a prank.

147
00:08:35,838 --> 00:08:38,638
What's up? Is something wrong?

148
00:08:38,638 --> 00:08:43,038
Well, the boy who was thought to have been kidnapped came home.

149
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:45,838
What? Don't tell me that you gave the 1 million yen?

150
00:08:45,838 --> 00:08:49,038
No, the culprit hasn't contacted us at all yet.

151
00:08:49,038 --> 00:08:52,038
Masashi doesn't even intend to hand over the money.

152
00:08:53,338 --> 00:08:56,238
It's already late, Kouta.

153
00:08:56,238 --> 00:08:58,938
Let's talk tomorrow. It's time to go to bed.

154
00:08:58,938 --> 00:08:59,938
Okay.

155
00:09:08,238 --> 00:09:09,338
Kouta.

156
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:13,038
What happened to your socks?

157
00:09:13,038 --> 00:09:14,538
They look wet.

158
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,138
This?

159
00:09:17,138 --> 00:09:23,238
I remembered that Masashi told me not to accept anything from strangers.

160
00:09:23,238 --> 00:09:26,038
After saying goodbye to the man with the beard,

161
00:09:26,038 --> 00:09:29,438
I went to give the card back to him.

162
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:32,138
But the man wasn't in the room

163
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,338
and a man that I didn't know was taking a bath.

164
00:09:34,338 --> 00:09:36,438
A stranger in the bath tub?

165
00:09:38,138 --> 00:09:42,038
So why don't we leave the rest to the police?

166
00:09:42,038 --> 00:09:43,938
It's time for the sports news.

167
00:09:43,938 --> 00:09:46,538
I'd like to see the results of the World Cup preliminaries.

168
00:09:46,538 --> 00:09:48,938
May I watch the television for a while?

169
00:09:48,938 --> 00:09:51,438
Yes, go right ahead.

170
00:09:51,438 --> 00:09:55,838
Well, it's 0 to 0 and a draw, but it was a good game nonetheless!

171
00:09:55,838 --> 00:09:57,938
What? It's 0 to 0.

172
00:09:57,938 --> 00:10:00,638
I guess they did pretty good for an away from home game.

173
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:03,138
Scoreless draw.

174
00:10:03,138 --> 00:10:06,338
I see. That's why Kouta...

175
00:10:06,338 --> 00:10:08,638
He's the culprit after all.

176
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,240
Didn't I already tell you?

177
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,640
This is a stupid prank that one of my friends pulled off.

178
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,840
He probably just wanted to see me get all worked up by taking Kouta away.

179
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,740
Besides, Kouta is back, isn't he?

180
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,540
But on top of demanding a million yen,

181
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,140
the kidnapper sent mail saying,

182
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,040
"If you call the police, I'll kill Kouta."

183
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,440
This is obviously blackmail and cannot be overlooked as a simple prank.

184
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,040
Besides, it was your voice that was heard from the answer phone

185
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,440
of the culprit's home.

186
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,040
The suspects have been narrowed down to the three men that you called,

187
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,740
so we can't overlook this.

188
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,240
Come on, Kouta.

189
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,740
Let's go to the homes of the three men.

190
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,240
Even if the culprit were to have been under disguise,

191
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,240
if you go inside, you'd know whose room it is, won't you?

192
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,040
-But... -Hey!

193
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,940
I keep telling you it's okay already.

194
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,840
Don't tell me that when you went to the homes of the three,

195
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,140
you secretly gave away the ransom.

196
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,840
If I gave it away, the officer would've found out long ago.

197
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,540
But there must've been something.

198
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,440
Maybe there was something of value in the things they sent you

199
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,940
and you returned it or something.

200
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,040
Like I already told you...

201
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,240
Huh?

202
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,940
Look at this picture on Aya's mail!

203
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,040
Hey, what are you looking at Conan?

204
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,240
An illustrator friend of mine often sends me these joke messages.

205
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,440
Gosh. Behave yourself, Conan!

206
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,840
But it said to click on the mail.

207
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,240
If I knew what was inside before I opened it,

208
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,640
I wouldn't have done what I did.

209
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,940
You idiot!

210
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,440
You shouldn't open other people's mail no matter what the contents!

211
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,540
Wait.

212
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,140
The kidnapper snuck into the house

213
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,840
knowing that both Masashi and Aya wouldn't be home

214
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,940
and tried to steal something, right?

215
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,640
Which means that Mr. Hikiya who sent the Yaiba card is innocent.

216
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,440
He wouldn't go through all this trouble if he didn't know what was inside.

217
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,640
I see.

218
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,540
As for lottery tickets that Mr. Rokuda sent here,

219
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,540
if the winner was a number continuing from the tickets he had himself,

220
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,440
he would know the winning ticket was here.

221
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,840
Yes. And the same can be said of Mr. Satsuka.

222
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,840
If he lost the rare yen bill that he bought,

223
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,340
it wouldn't be strange if he thought that he may have sent it to Masashi.

224
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,840
Talking of sending things,

225
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:42,840
Pops also received a bottle wrapped in shiny paper the other day.

226
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,140
That's called champagne.

227
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,540
A client sent it to us as a token of thanks for solving a case.

228
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,140
It's juice, right? I want to drink it, too.

229
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,140
It's liquor, children can't drink it.

230
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,340
Besides, dad drank it all up already.

231
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,240
I guess it can't be helped then.

232
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,540
That's right.

233
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,440
If it's liquor, Pops will open it as soon as he gets it

234
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,440
and puts into his stomach.

235
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,740
Wait a second.

236
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,440
If money is sent by using registered mail for cash,

237
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,240
we would open it right away and put the cash in our wallet.

238
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,540
If so, if there were any rare yen bills, it would be in Masashi's wallet.

239
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,840
So coming into the house to get it back won't help.

240
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,740
If so, the suspicious one is...

241
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,340
Mr. Rokuda who sent the lottery tickets.

242
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,240
It can't be.

243
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,040
Because I'm not interested in lottery tickets and I might throw them away.

244
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,340
I wonder.

245
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:38,640
You could've left it on your desk without opening the envelope.

246
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,140
I see.

247
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,940
Since you don't care about them, you might not notice if they were gone.

248
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,040
You might not even realize that they had been stolen either.

249
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,340
Hold it.

250
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,840
Aren't you forgetting something?

251
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,640
Kouta said he watched a boring baseball game at that man's apartment.

252
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,040
I called Rokuda's house on that day after noon.

253
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,840
The games that were playing then

254
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,440
was a hot high school baseball game with reversal after reversal,

255
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,140
and a Major League program called "Nice Game Selection". Only those two.

256
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,440
Hey, Kouta. The one you saw was boring, right?

257
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,240
Yes. It wasn't fun at all.

258
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,340
Look. There's no way that Rokuda is the culprit.

259
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:22,640
But "Safe Game" is written by the program "Nice Game Selection".

260
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,040
If it's "safe", maybe it's not exciting, but boring.

261
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,840
Stupid!

262
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,340
That Kanji character is read as "complete", not "safe".

263
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,240
In other words, it's a perfect game,

264
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,440
It's when the pitcher doesn't let the opposing batters score even one hit.

265
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,140
It's an exciting game.

266
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,140
Don't tell me that...

267
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,840
It's true that a complete game is exciting,

268
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,140
but it may look to be a boring game to children

269
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,640
who don't know much about baseball.

270
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,540
Moreover, with a broadcast slot of only an hour,

271
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,540
most of the offensive play of the players on the pitcher's team

272
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,040
were probably edited and cut.

273
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,440
It would only show scenes of the opposing batters getting out.

274
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,440
I can understand why he would think the game to be boring.

275
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,940
Kouta, that's how it was, right?

276
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,240
Yeah.

277
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,240
The batters kept getting three strikes,

278
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,340
so everyone was just getting outs.

279
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,240
Then I guess Mr. Rokuda is the kidnapper.

280
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,240
Wait.

281
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,140
Even if Rokuda were to be the culprit, it's attempted kidnap, right?

282
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,240
He didn't take money from me.

283
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,640
Besides, it seems as if he needs money,

284
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,640
so I'm sure he just impulsively did it.

285
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,840
You knew that a winning ticket was in there, didn't you?

286
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,140
Knowing that he was in need of money,

287
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,340
so you sent the tickets back to him that is still in the envelope.

288
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,940
But not knowing that, Mr. Rokuda came into the house,

289
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,540
panicked after seeing that the envelope was gone and kidnapped Kouta.

290
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,440
And because of his situation, you suspected Mr. Rokuda from the beginning.

291
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,040
Then you suggested going to his house.

292
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,340
Seeing the mailbox jam packed with mail...

293
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:59,540
Maybe there's something good in that bulging mailbox of yours.

294
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,440
Isn't this how it was?

295
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,940
Am I wrong?

296
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,840
Yeah, you're right. Exactly.

297
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,540
Who cares?

298
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,140
He's the one who bought the lottery tickets to begin with anyway.

299
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:17,840
Besides, he's the only one that's still into music without quitting.

300
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,340
It was our dream.

301
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,640
Our group from long ago.

302
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,340
We all quit because it's getting tougher.

303
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,440
Except him.

304
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,340
So please give him a break this time, officer.

305
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,640
No.

306
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,840
Kidnapping is a crime that's equal to murder, a very ruthless crime.

307
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,540
I can't forgive him.

308
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,540
Especially since it was just for money.

309
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,940
I can't sympathize with one who wants to realize his dream

310
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,140
at the expense of hurting the hearts of others.

311
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,640
Although I feel that it's unfortunate for him.

312
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,940
I guess so.

313
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,340
He's so stupid.

314
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,340
Officer Takagi, we're going to raid Mr. Rokuda's house.

315
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,940
Gosh! What's he doing at a time like this?

316
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,540
Inspector, we've figured out who the kidnapper is!

317
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,140
It's Masashi's childhood friend, Takuji Rokuda!

318
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,140
There is a possibility that he may flee.

319
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,340
If he refuses to come voluntarily, arrest him without a warrant.

320
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,940
No, I can't do that.

321
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,040
Just a while ago, he came running with a pale face.

322
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,640
Who did?

323
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,140
Officer Sato.

324
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,240
Inspector.

325
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,640
It was him. Over there.

326
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,340
Officer Takagi.

327
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,340
What's with all that blood?

328
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,540
Don't tell me

329
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,940
that you went in and fought with the culprit to try to look good.

330
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,140
No, that's the kidnapper blood.

331
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,840
He saved him.

332
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,840
Officer Takagi broke into the room and saved Mr. Rokuda.

333
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,840
Officer Takagi!

334
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,040
Just what do you think you're doing?

335
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,740
Darn it!

336
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,940
Suicide?

337
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,440
He cut his wrist.

338
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,740
He's already been taken away by ambulance.

339
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,940
It seems that he'll make it because he was found early enough.

340
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,240
I guess we'll have him come in voluntarily after he recovers.

341
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,340
How did you know he was going to commit suicide?

342
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,240
Kouta's socks.

343
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,840
I asked him why they were wet.

344
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,140
Kouta said when he went back to Mr. Rokuda's place,

345
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,740
but there was a stranger in the bathroom.

346
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:41,540
Mr. Rokuda released Kouta, removed his disguise

347
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:45,140
and committed suicide in the bath tub.

348
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,240
The fact that Kouta's socks were wet,

349
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,540
means that he went into the bathtub

350
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,840
and went up to Mr. Rokuda.

351
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,740
If Mr. Rokuda were conscious then,

352
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,640
he wouldn't have let Kouta do so.

353
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,940
I see.

354
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,040
He found the lottery tickets that had been returned in his mailbox.

355
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,240
He realized Mr. Emoto still cared for him

356
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,840
and was unable to endure the weight of the crime he had committed.

357
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,740
It's amazing that you figured out that Takuji Rokuda was the culprit.

358
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,840
I figured that among the mail that was sent to Masashi,

359
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,240
the only thing you would know the value of beforehand

360
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,940
and could go in later to steal are the lottery tickets.

361
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,340
Then why didn't you tell me about it?

362
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,840
Well...

363
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,740
I wasn't confident about my deduction,

364
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,940
so I thought I'd go check things out first.

365
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,540
I'm sorry.

366
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,040
Inspector Megure, I'll leave the rest up to you.

367
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,540
Officer Sato.

368
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,140
Officer Sato, write a report to submit to headquarters, will you?

369
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,340
What? Yes, sir.

370
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,140
You too, Officer Takagi.

371
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,140
Yes, sir.

372
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,840
I've got to stay here and wait for the search warrant.

373
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,340
You can use my car. Have you been drinking?

374
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,540
I only had soft drinks.

375
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,540
I'm sorry.

376
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,640
What's with you?

377
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,740
Did you do something that you have to apologize to me about?

378
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,040
But you're angry.

379
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,140
Does it look like I am?

380
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,640
If it's about the social...

381
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,940
It's okay.

382
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,540
I bet Officer Chiba told you they were short on people

383
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,940
and you couldn't refuse, right?

384
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,840
Well, it did look as if you had some expectations

385
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,340
about the girls who were there.

386
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,340
So you're angry about the incident

387
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,640
that just happened after all, right?

388
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,640
I'm sorry for not telling you, my superior, about it,

389
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,940
and acted on my own.

390
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,540
But by the time I realized what I was doing,

391
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,240
my body was already running of its own accord.

392
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,940
I'm really sorry.

393
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,140
Don't apologize.

394
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,540
You did something way greater than just nab a person.

395
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,540
You did something fantastic.

396
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:53,440
I'm upset that I wasn't thinking about what the suspect would be feeling.

397
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,840
And I'm mad at myself for fixating only on apprehending him.

398
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,740
And when at the same time some other person could see the big picture,

399
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,140
I couldn't.

400
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:07,440
I only figured it out because I also buy lottery tickets frequently, so...

401
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,440
The odds are as low as buying lottery tickets.

402
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,840
I mean that both of us who are going out with each other

403
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,840
would be invited separately to a gathering and run into each other there.

404
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,240
That's true.

405
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,540
I mean, I've never even once won a lottery.

406
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,440
You mean that I'm a losing ticket then?

407
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,340
No, you're a smash hit! Super special huge hit!

408
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,840
Keep your eyes on the road!

409
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,740
You really think so?

410
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,940
Yes. I pledge my heart!

411
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:40,940
Then will you confirm if I'm a big hit or not?

412
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,840
Yes, it's my pleasure.

413
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,440
Don't tell me that you two have forgotten that we're in the car, too?

414
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,140
Huh? Another social gathering?

415
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,440
That's right. They don't have enough girls again this time.

416
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,640
Yumi, I'm sorry. But this time, I'll pass.

417
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,040
I've had more than enough of my share last time already.

418
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,540
What? There's an all-you-can-eat cake buffet after the meal?

419
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,440
Moreover, the host is treating?

420
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,740
I'll go, I'll go.

421
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,040
As soon as I nab the robber of Shinjuku 3-chome,

422
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,940
I'll go dashing over!

423
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,540
Officer Sato.

424
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,560
Next Conan's Hint:

425
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,460
"Gum"

426
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,600
Officer Sato, this time for sure, let's just the two of us...

427
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,040
Miwako, do you want to go sing karaoke?

428
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,040
-Okay. -Yumi, you're really in the way.
