1
00:00:22,988 --> 00:00:24,788
Time capsules come out one after another.

2
00:00:24,788 --> 00:00:26,388
Gathering secrets that are scattered here and there.

3
00:00:26,388 --> 00:00:28,088
Dig out the unexpected killer!

4
00:00:28,088 --> 00:00:29,488
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,288
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,288 --> 00:00:33,288
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:57,342 --> 00:02:00,842
Doc, the members of the Youth Detective Squad and I,

8
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:03,042
came along on a weekend tour to Kibitsuji, Kurashiki in Okayama Prefecture

9
00:02:03,042 --> 00:02:06,242
to study ancient history.

10
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:11,542
Out of the five people we met there, one person was killed.

11
00:02:11,542 --> 00:02:15,442
A member of the group ends up being investigated as a major witness.

12
00:02:17,142 --> 00:02:19,742
However, I had my doubts.

13
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:23,742
I see. So that's the story.

14
00:02:23,742 --> 00:02:27,442
If so, the contents of the dying message would change.

15
00:02:27,442 --> 00:02:30,342
The killer is among the four of them!

16
00:02:30,342 --> 00:02:33,742
But in order to specify who it is,

17
00:02:33,742 --> 00:02:36,642
the remaining two codes will have to be solved.

18
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:44,842
"Peach Boy Mystery Solving Tour (Part 2)"

19
00:02:47,942 --> 00:02:49,642
I don't have conclusive proof.

20
00:02:49,642 --> 00:02:53,642
But if the motive of the murder has to do with the time capsule,

21
00:02:53,642 --> 00:02:54,742
Then...

22
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:58,942
Let's continue deciphering the remaining code.

23
00:02:58,942 --> 00:03:01,642
I agree! Let's finish what we started.

24
00:03:01,642 --> 00:03:06,442
Although there's no treasure, I feel like we can't back off anymore.

25
00:03:06,442 --> 00:03:10,242
Me, too! But what're we going to do?

26
00:03:10,242 --> 00:03:12,742
The code was burned, wasn't it?

27
00:03:12,742 --> 00:03:14,742
Right.

28
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:18,042
Thinking something like this could happen...

29
00:03:19,842 --> 00:03:23,142
I, Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya, took notes!

30
00:03:23,142 --> 00:03:25,942
All right, Mitsuhiko!

31
00:03:25,942 --> 00:03:28,242
Good work, Mitsuhiko.

32
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:31,842
Okay! The Youth Detective Squad will launch the operation!

33
00:03:36,142 --> 00:03:38,442
This is an umbrella.

34
00:03:38,442 --> 00:03:41,142
And this is the sun, right?

35
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:47,442
You tried your best to copy it, didn't you?

36
00:03:47,442 --> 00:03:49,242
I think this is!

37
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:51,842
Yes. That's it.

38
00:03:51,842 --> 00:03:54,642
Doc sure is late.

39
00:03:54,642 --> 00:03:56,342
I wonder what's taking him so long.

40
00:03:56,342 --> 00:03:57,942
Isn't that his car?

41
00:03:59,142 --> 00:04:00,742
We don't have all day, Doc!

42
00:04:00,742 --> 00:04:03,242
I'm so sorry.

43
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:05,542
And, where would you like me to take you?

44
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:07,342
To the neighboring Soja City.

45
00:04:07,342 --> 00:04:09,242
The so-called Kibitsuji.

46
00:04:09,242 --> 00:04:10,342
Roger!

47
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:13,442
Kibiji?

48
00:04:13,442 --> 00:04:16,442
More accurately, called the Koumorizuka Tomb.

49
00:04:16,442 --> 00:04:18,742
It's a famous tomb located in Kibitsuji.

50
00:04:19,942 --> 00:04:21,542
Oh, I see!

51
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:23,442
This is it!

52
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:25,142
That's right, Genta.

53
00:04:25,142 --> 00:04:27,342
It's an umbrella. "Koumori gasa (Umbrella)"

54
00:04:27,342 --> 00:04:29,042
I see!

55
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:31,842
I almost forgot.

56
00:04:31,842 --> 00:04:34,342
It's information regarding the case.

57
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:38,042
It seems that Mr. Saruwatari in place of Mr. Onitsura

58
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:41,942
is being questioned as a major witness.

59
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:45,542
Of course he's denying the charges.

60
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:48,542
Something about they found out that there was a change in cast

61
00:04:48,542 --> 00:04:51,342
in the play that was performed 15 years ago.

62
00:04:51,342 --> 00:04:52,542
A change?

63
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,642
It seems that Mr. Onitsura was not good at remembering his lines,

64
00:04:55,642 --> 00:04:59,542
so he changed roles with Mr. Saruwatari.

65
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:05,042
So the possibility of the dying message "ONI" being Mr. Saruwatari came up.

66
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:07,642
He doesn't have an alibi and besides,

67
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:10,542
above all he was the one who was arguing with the victim.

68
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:14,342
It seems he soon may be arrested.

69
00:05:14,342 --> 00:05:16,542
I kind of had a feeling

70
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:19,842
because dogs and monkeys don't get along. Just as I thought.

71
00:05:19,842 --> 00:05:24,142
But in the story "Peach Boy", they work together to defeat the ogre.

72
00:05:24,142 --> 00:05:27,242
That just goes to show that it's no more than a fairy tale after all.

73
00:05:27,242 --> 00:05:29,342
It sure is a bit disappointing.

74
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:31,042
Anyway, let's hurry.

75
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:33,642
We've got to confirm all the capsules.

76
00:05:36,242 --> 00:05:37,342
How beautiful.

77
00:05:37,342 --> 00:05:40,642
There's something nostalgic about this.

78
00:05:40,642 --> 00:05:44,042
In ancient times, this area was called the Land of Kibitsu,

79
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:48,342
and was said to be just as powerful as the Yamato Imperial Court!

80
00:05:50,842 --> 00:05:52,642
Super!

81
00:05:52,642 --> 00:05:56,642
This is the large key-hole shaped tomb, isn't it?

82
00:05:56,642 --> 00:05:58,642
I'm sure we can go inside.

83
00:06:00,942 --> 00:06:02,642
How scary.

84
00:06:02,642 --> 00:06:04,942
This Komorizuka Tomb

85
00:06:04,942 --> 00:06:08,042
is said have been built at the end of the 6th Century,

86
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:11,642
and in Kibitsuji a lot more other tombs have also been found.

87
00:06:11,642 --> 00:06:14,242
It's really starting to get like we're treasure hunting.

88
00:06:14,242 --> 00:06:16,942
But it's so fast that we've got lots of work to do.

89
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:18,242
We're capable of finding what we're looking for,

90
00:06:18,242 --> 00:06:19,942
that's why we're called the Youth Detective Squad.

91
00:06:19,942 --> 00:06:23,442
Besides, I'm sure that it's been dug over again anyway.

92
00:06:23,442 --> 00:06:24,842
So it won't be hard to find.

93
00:06:28,842 --> 00:06:30,842
There it is! I found it!

94
00:06:30,842 --> 00:06:34,142
-Again? -Yes. Again.

95
00:06:34,142 --> 00:06:36,742
It's dug over again by someone.

96
00:06:36,742 --> 00:06:38,442
This is all that's inside.

97
00:06:38,442 --> 00:06:40,242
What is this?

98
00:06:40,242 --> 00:06:41,842
Is it a code again?

99
00:06:44,742 --> 00:06:46,742
They've got us, Mitsuhiko.

100
00:06:46,742 --> 00:06:48,442
That code's a dummy.

101
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:49,842
What? A dummy?

102
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,542
You mean it's fake?

103
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:54,842
Yes. Take a good look at the code.

104
00:06:54,842 --> 00:06:58,042
A half folded umbrella under the sun.

105
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,642
There's no need to use it.

106
00:06:59,642 --> 00:07:02,142
In other words, it's meaningless.

107
00:07:02,142 --> 00:07:04,942
The real code is this new one here.

108
00:07:04,942 --> 00:07:08,642
This is a shrine gate. And what's this?

109
00:07:08,642 --> 00:07:11,742
A pot for cooking rice?

110
00:07:11,742 --> 00:07:15,742
On top of it is a peach?

111
00:07:15,742 --> 00:07:19,142
A shrine gate, rice cooker and peach.

112
00:07:19,142 --> 00:07:21,742
Sounds familiar.

113
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,542
It's Kibitsu Shrine!

114
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:24,942
Kibitsu Shrine?

115
00:07:24,942 --> 00:07:26,342
Yes!

116
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:32,042
It's the place where the hero...

117
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:39,342
Kibitsuhiko-no-Mikoto, who as legend has it, is enshrined!

118
00:07:39,342 --> 00:07:42,542
You've really studied well beforehand. How amazing.

119
00:07:44,142 --> 00:07:47,142
I see! The peach stands for Peach Boy

120
00:07:47,142 --> 00:07:49,042
and the shrine gate stands for shrine.

121
00:07:49,042 --> 00:07:51,142
Then, what about this pot?

122
00:07:51,142 --> 00:07:53,142
That's...

123
00:07:53,142 --> 00:07:57,142
I guess we'll find out if we go there.

124
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:59,342
I'll wait for all of you here.

125
00:07:59,342 --> 00:08:01,242
-No fair. -No fair.

126
00:08:01,242 --> 00:08:03,942
Hurry, Youth Detective Squad!

127
00:08:11,142 --> 00:08:12,542
I'm tired.

128
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:14,642
I'm hungry.

129
00:08:14,642 --> 00:08:15,942
Okay, let's go!

130
00:08:15,942 --> 00:08:17,942
Wait, Conan!

131
00:08:23,142 --> 00:08:24,242
Wait!

132
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:26,142
Let's take it slow.

133
00:08:26,142 --> 00:08:27,642
I'm starved!

134
00:08:33,342 --> 00:08:34,942
A rice cooker.

135
00:08:34,942 --> 00:08:36,742
I see.

136
00:08:37,942 --> 00:08:39,642
With the sound of the rice cooker

137
00:08:39,642 --> 00:08:41,942
we can tell if our fortune is lucky or not.

138
00:08:42,942 --> 00:08:44,742
Sounds interesting.

139
00:08:44,742 --> 00:08:47,242
Okay! It's got to be somewhere around here.

140
00:08:47,242 --> 00:08:48,542
Let's search.

141
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:51,342
I'm sure it's probably going to be dug over again.

142
00:08:51,342 --> 00:08:53,942
That'll be our approach.

143
00:08:56,342 --> 00:08:57,742
Here it is!

144
00:08:57,742 --> 00:09:01,142
I guess it's not a dummy this time.

145
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:03,142
All that's inside is junk.

146
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,242
That's not nice.

147
00:09:05,242 --> 00:09:08,942
It's their treasure of 15 years ago.

148
00:09:08,942 --> 00:09:12,042
Shunya, please rest in peace.

149
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:13,442
Shunya.

150
00:09:13,442 --> 00:09:16,542
He's the one who passed away in a traffic accident 15 years ago, right?

151
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:20,542
I see! The writings that we found in the capsules up to now

152
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:23,442
were all about Shunya!

153
00:09:23,442 --> 00:09:25,142
Yes.

154
00:09:25,142 --> 00:09:26,842
Most probably.

155
00:09:26,842 --> 00:09:30,842
Which means that the remaining time capsule...

156
00:09:33,242 --> 00:09:35,642
Are we going back to Kurashiki again?

157
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,042
A flower petal?

158
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:39,142
This is the pistil.

159
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:40,842
And this is the stem.

160
00:09:40,842 --> 00:09:43,442
But it's scattered.

161
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:47,242
Maybe they're supposed to overlay one on top the other?

162
00:09:47,242 --> 00:09:50,742
Could this be a water lily?

163
00:09:50,742 --> 00:09:53,742
Right! Water lily in Kurashiki.

164
00:09:53,742 --> 00:09:55,242
It's over there!

165
00:09:55,242 --> 00:09:56,942
Where?

166
00:09:56,942 --> 00:09:58,042
Over here!

167
00:09:58,042 --> 00:09:59,742
Ohara art gallery?

168
00:10:01,042 --> 00:10:02,442
Water lily.

169
00:10:02,442 --> 00:10:04,242
How cute.

170
00:10:04,242 --> 00:10:06,842
So the capsule is over here.

171
00:10:06,842 --> 00:10:10,842
No. Water lilies were planted here only recently.

172
00:10:10,842 --> 00:10:13,142
It says, the year 2000 in commemoration

173
00:10:13,142 --> 00:10:15,842
of the 70th year since its establishment.

174
00:10:15,842 --> 00:10:18,442
In other words, the water lily in the code

175
00:10:18,442 --> 00:10:21,742
is referring to the drawing of a famous artist called Monet.

176
00:10:21,742 --> 00:10:23,342
And most probably somewhere near the main building

177
00:10:23,342 --> 00:10:25,842
where that drawing is exhibited.

178
00:10:27,842 --> 00:10:30,042
This place is too big.

179
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:32,742
It was so easy until now, but...

180
00:10:32,742 --> 00:10:34,842
Walk another 25 steps.

181
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,242
What's up?

182
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:40,342
Another 26 steps that is written on this code.

183
00:10:40,342 --> 00:10:43,842
Could it be about this statue?

184
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:47,542
I see! It means that in the place after taking 25 more steps...

185
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:49,342
What?

186
00:10:49,342 --> 00:10:50,742
I found it.

187
00:10:50,742 --> 00:10:52,942
Fantastic, Ayumi.

188
00:10:52,942 --> 00:10:55,642
It's amazing that you figured it out.

189
00:10:55,642 --> 00:10:57,742
But how strange.

190
00:10:57,742 --> 00:11:01,542
There doesn't seem to be any writing inside.

191
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:02,742
Just as I thought.

192
00:11:02,742 --> 00:11:04,542
What's this?

193
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:06,942
Something is stuck to the bottom.

194
00:11:06,942 --> 00:11:10,342
The envelope looks to be different from the ones up to now.

195
00:11:11,842 --> 00:11:14,042
This is?

196
00:11:19,285 --> 00:11:21,185
Well, everyone.

197
00:11:21,185 --> 00:11:24,185
You are all acquaintances of that Sleeping Kogoro,

198
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:27,885
Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

199
00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:29,685
Mouri...

200
00:11:29,685 --> 00:11:31,585
Kogoro.

201
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:32,885
That famous...

202
00:11:32,885 --> 00:11:36,085
We just got word from Mr. Mouri a while ago,

203
00:11:36,085 --> 00:11:38,385
telling us to get the details from Mr. Agasa.

204
00:11:38,385 --> 00:11:39,685
Agasa.

205
00:11:40,985 --> 00:11:41,985
Me?

206
00:11:41,985 --> 00:11:47,285
I hear that you are just as good as Mr. Mouri in making deductions.

207
00:11:47,285 --> 00:11:50,485
Who is this Mr. Kogoro?

208
00:11:50,485 --> 00:11:53,385
Just what do you want with us at this point?

209
00:11:55,085 --> 00:11:56,485
I'm counting on you, Doc.

210
00:12:00,485 --> 00:12:03,285
Well...

211
00:12:03,285 --> 00:12:06,785
Then, let me start my deduction.

212
00:12:06,785 --> 00:12:12,585
About Mr. Saruwatari, who is thought will be arrested soon.

213
00:12:12,585 --> 00:12:14,985
The fact is, he's innocent.

214
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,385
The real culprit is someone else.

215
00:12:17,385 --> 00:12:18,785
That's what I kept trying to tell you!

216
00:12:18,785 --> 00:12:22,385
What? Do you mean that it is Mr. Onitsura after all then?

217
00:12:22,385 --> 00:12:25,085
You got to be kidding! I didn't do it!

218
00:12:25,085 --> 00:12:28,485
Well, let me explain things in order.

219
00:12:28,485 --> 00:12:31,785
15 years ago, you all put things that were precious to you

220
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:34,885
inside a time capsule and exchanged it with each other.

221
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:37,685
And each of you buried someone else's capsule.

222
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:40,485
Let me reconfirm something here.

223
00:12:40,485 --> 00:12:44,985
Mr. Momoi hid Seiko's capsule in the Hinomi Watchtower.

224
00:12:44,985 --> 00:12:49,785
Seiko hid Mr. Onitsura's capsule in the garden of the Ohashi residence.

225
00:12:49,785 --> 00:12:55,385
Mr. Onitsura hid Mr. Saruwatari's capsule here in Ivy Square.

226
00:12:55,385 --> 00:13:00,085
Mr. Saruwatari hid Yayoi's capsule or rather a dummy in Komorizuka,

227
00:13:00,085 --> 00:13:03,285
and the actual capsule in Kibitsu Shrine.

228
00:13:03,285 --> 00:13:07,785
And finally, Mr. Momoi's capsule in the Ohara Art Gallery.

229
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:11,785
This one was buried by Yayoi, am I right?

230
00:13:11,785 --> 00:13:15,585
The members of the Youth Detective Squad dug the capsules out.

231
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:18,385
The problem is though, before the members of the squad got there,

232
00:13:18,385 --> 00:13:21,085
every capsule was already dug over.

233
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:22,985
So like I said, the killer just wanted

234
00:13:22,985 --> 00:13:25,285
to make it look like somebody broke into school.

235
00:13:25,285 --> 00:13:28,985
There's one thing we just can't seem to understand.

236
00:13:28,985 --> 00:13:31,585
Why was only Mr. Momoi's capsule missing something in writing

237
00:13:31,585 --> 00:13:36,185
that was included in everybody else's capsule?

238
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:41,585
It just didn't appeal to me to bury something like that.

239
00:13:41,585 --> 00:13:42,985
That's all there is to it.

240
00:13:42,985 --> 00:13:45,985
No. I'll bet it was actually inside.

241
00:13:45,985 --> 00:13:49,785
You removed it and got rid of it.

242
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:51,785
But Seiko happened to see you.

243
00:13:51,785 --> 00:13:53,685
Isn't that it, Mr. Momoi?

244
00:13:54,685 --> 00:13:55,685
What?

245
00:13:55,685 --> 00:13:57,285
You?

246
00:13:57,285 --> 00:13:58,285
Naoto?

247
00:13:58,285 --> 00:13:59,385
You got to be kidding!

248
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:01,085
What proof do you have?

249
00:14:01,085 --> 00:14:02,685
Let me explain.

250
00:14:02,685 --> 00:14:05,485
First, the dying message.

251
00:14:05,485 --> 00:14:08,185
The point is the position of the victim's finger.

252
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:09,885
Position of her finger?

253
00:14:09,885 --> 00:14:13,085
Seiko, the victim, was left handed.

254
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:17,385
Therefore, she would've written her dying message with her right hand.

255
00:14:17,385 --> 00:14:20,885
But if so, the position of her finger is odd.

256
00:14:20,885 --> 00:14:23,185
Her finger should've near the last "I" of the message,

257
00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:26,285
but it was by the first letter, "O".

258
00:14:26,285 --> 00:14:27,985
True.

259
00:14:27,985 --> 00:14:33,285
By the way, left handed people usually right their letters in reverse.

260
00:14:33,285 --> 00:14:35,785
Don't you think the same goes for this?

261
00:14:35,785 --> 00:14:38,185
That is, viewed from the position of the finger,

262
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:41,185
it was not written from left to right,

263
00:14:41,185 --> 00:14:44,285
but rather, from right to left backwards.

264
00:14:44,285 --> 00:14:47,885
And if the part that is erased is connected with a line...

265
00:14:47,885 --> 00:14:48,985
I see!

266
00:14:48,985 --> 00:14:52,785
It wasn't "ONI" but rather, she tried to write "Momo"!

267
00:14:52,785 --> 00:14:54,385
Exactly!

268
00:14:54,385 --> 00:14:59,685
In other words, "ONI" neither meant Mr. Onitsura nor Mr. Saruwatari,

269
00:14:59,685 --> 00:15:02,185
but was pointing out that Mr. Momoi is the killer.

270
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:03,485
That's ridiculous!

271
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,985
That's all nothing but imagination!

272
00:15:05,985 --> 00:15:07,885
I even have an alibi!

273
00:15:07,885 --> 00:15:09,685
Yayoi.

274
00:15:09,685 --> 00:15:11,285
You were walking together with Mr. Momoi

275
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,285
through the Fine Sights district, is that right?

276
00:15:14,285 --> 00:15:17,785
You said you only separated for five minutes to go to the restroom.

277
00:15:17,785 --> 00:15:19,085
Yes.

278
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:22,885
It's not obvious, but it's really nothing once you know about it.

279
00:15:22,885 --> 00:15:26,585
Can you continue, Youth Detective Squad?

280
00:15:26,585 --> 00:15:27,585
Yes!

281
00:15:27,585 --> 00:15:30,285
The Ivy Square and Fine Sights District

282
00:15:30,285 --> 00:15:32,885
are actually located back to back.

283
00:15:32,885 --> 00:15:34,785
If you walk on the outside in front, they seem to be some distance apart,

284
00:15:34,785 --> 00:15:38,985
but if you walk within the grounds or the buildings, they are very near!

285
00:15:38,985 --> 00:15:42,385
A round trip takes 1 minute 50 seconds!

286
00:15:42,385 --> 00:15:47,385
He probably made Seiko wait here beforehand.

287
00:15:47,385 --> 00:15:49,785
Then he came to her and killed her.

288
00:15:49,785 --> 00:15:51,885
Then, ran back.

289
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:52,985
Naoto?

290
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,785
No! That's a lie!

291
00:15:54,785 --> 00:16:00,185
And after he killed Seiko,

292
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:02,585
he dug over the capsules in this area.

293
00:16:02,585 --> 00:16:04,985
It should've taken him about an hour.

294
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:07,585
So the time of the crime would've been about 14:00.

295
00:16:07,585 --> 00:16:15,285
Wasn't he out of your sight for about an hour?

296
00:16:16,385 --> 00:16:18,685
True. He said he wanted to go check something

297
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:21,285
so he was going to the bookstores and to the library.

298
00:16:21,285 --> 00:16:22,785
You're only making assumptions.

299
00:16:22,785 --> 00:16:25,885
You have no evidence to support what you're saying at all!

300
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:29,685
There is proof in your wallet.

301
00:16:31,085 --> 00:16:33,385
My wallet?

302
00:16:33,385 --> 00:16:37,385
You, the killer, in order to make it look

303
00:16:37,385 --> 00:16:40,785
as if Mr. Onitsura, the alleged killer, broke into school,

304
00:16:40,785 --> 00:16:43,585
removed the contents inside the victim's wallet.

305
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,085
However, since you couldn't just dispose of it,

306
00:16:46,085 --> 00:16:48,285
you put it inside your wallet.

307
00:16:48,285 --> 00:16:50,485
You still have it with you, don't you?

308
00:16:50,485 --> 00:16:52,085
Tell me, will you?

309
00:16:52,085 --> 00:16:54,185
Just what proof do you have to say

310
00:16:54,185 --> 00:16:56,585
that the money from Seiko's wallet is in my wallet?

311
00:16:56,585 --> 00:17:00,185
Officer Tsuyama, did you bring the you-know-what here?

312
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,585
Oh, yes.

313
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:03,585
The thing that Mr. Mouri told me about on the phone.

314
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:05,185
This, right?

315
00:17:05,185 --> 00:17:08,085
Officer Tsuyama, please check the wallet.

316
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:12,685
Do you see one bill in there that has something odd stuck to it?

317
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:14,785
Odd?

318
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,285
This is...

319
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,785
So what about it?

320
00:17:18,785 --> 00:17:22,085
If a bill is dirty, does that make me the killer?

321
00:17:22,085 --> 00:17:23,585
Mr. Momoi.

322
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:26,885
How are you going to explain this?

323
00:17:26,885 --> 00:17:32,885
Normally it would only look as if the stamp of the ticket smeared off.

324
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:38,385
Only in your wallet there was the other half of the stamp mark

325
00:17:38,385 --> 00:17:43,185
that was found on this pamphlet of the art gallery.

326
00:17:43,185 --> 00:17:46,585
Seiko probably put the ticket on top of the pamphlet

327
00:17:46,585 --> 00:17:49,285
then put them inside her wallet.

328
00:17:49,285 --> 00:17:51,285
Not knowing that, Mr. Momoi,

329
00:17:51,285 --> 00:17:55,885
you left the pamphlet back at the site and took only the bill with you.

330
00:17:55,885 --> 00:17:57,585
Thanks to the admission stamp,

331
00:17:57,585 --> 00:18:00,385
you took the bill that coincidentally became a pair.

332
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:09,985
It's because Seiko and that thing 15 years ago.

333
00:18:11,285 --> 00:18:16,185
Because she started investigating what happened 15 years ago.

334
00:18:16,185 --> 00:18:21,485
15 years ago, everything started back then.

335
00:18:21,485 --> 00:18:23,085
Momoi, as a boy back then,

336
00:18:23,085 --> 00:18:26,085
was bullied by other kids.

337
00:18:26,085 --> 00:18:28,685
That day, when Momoi was being forced to shoplift by bullies,

338
00:18:28,685 --> 00:18:31,085
he was seen by Shunya.

339
00:18:31,085 --> 00:18:32,485
Momoi.

340
00:18:35,185 --> 00:18:37,685
I thought he was going to squeak on me.

341
00:18:37,685 --> 00:18:40,785
That he'd tell the teacher and my parents.

342
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:42,185
That's what I thought.

343
00:18:44,885 --> 00:18:48,085
Back then, Momoi never spoke of anyone about that incident.

344
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,285
But because of his feeling of guilt,

345
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:53,385
he impulsively wrote the truth and put it inside the time capsule.

346
00:18:54,685 --> 00:18:56,385
I was graduating anyway,

347
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,085
and I get to sever ties with those guys, too.

348
00:18:59,085 --> 00:19:01,585
I thought that we'd never be digging the capsules out again.

349
00:19:01,585 --> 00:19:02,985
Back then...

350
00:19:04,085 --> 00:19:07,785
Three days ago, I got a call from Seiko,

351
00:19:07,785 --> 00:19:09,585
saying that since she's going to hold an interview,

352
00:19:09,585 --> 00:19:11,585
she'd like to dig out the capsules while she's at it.

353
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:15,585
And you snuck into school just for that one piece of paper.

354
00:19:15,585 --> 00:19:17,485
You didn't have to kill her!

355
00:19:17,485 --> 00:19:19,485
All you had to do was throw that paper away somewhere.

356
00:19:19,485 --> 00:19:21,285
Then it would've been done and over with.

357
00:19:22,785 --> 00:19:26,085
Where do you think I am now?

358
00:19:27,485 --> 00:19:29,585
You know the capsule that I buried?

359
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:33,385
When I came to look for it, it was already dug up.

360
00:19:33,385 --> 00:19:35,485
You're the only one who could've done it, right?

361
00:19:35,485 --> 00:19:39,385
You're the only one who knew that I was going to dig out the time capsule.

362
00:19:39,385 --> 00:19:41,185
Why did you do this?

363
00:19:42,585 --> 00:19:43,985
Don't tell me

364
00:19:43,985 --> 00:19:45,585
that I could've written some kind of scoop article about it?

365
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:48,185
She always used to bluff from before!

366
00:19:48,185 --> 00:19:50,385
She just put a leading question to you.

367
00:19:51,685 --> 00:19:53,585
I was scared.

368
00:19:53,585 --> 00:19:55,585
I felt like she knew everything.

369
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:57,485
Miss.

370
00:19:57,485 --> 00:20:01,185
I found this inside the last capsule.

371
00:20:01,185 --> 00:20:04,185
We'll hear you out at the station then, Mr. Momoi.

372
00:20:04,185 --> 00:20:05,285
Wait!

373
00:20:06,385 --> 00:20:07,685
Please.

374
00:20:07,685 --> 00:20:11,185
All together. For the last time, I'd like to go all together.

375
00:20:11,185 --> 00:20:13,285
There's a place I really want to go.

376
00:20:15,785 --> 00:20:19,585
You're the one who put this code inside the capsule and buried it, right?

377
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:24,285
I was asked by Shunya, a while before he died,

378
00:20:24,285 --> 00:20:27,485
that he wanted to go with everybody to bury the capsule.

379
00:20:27,485 --> 00:20:31,485
But after the accident, I was too scared to look inside and didn't look.

380
00:20:31,485 --> 00:20:34,485
That code is an anagram, right?

381
00:20:34,485 --> 00:20:38,985
Yes, it's opened in hiragana then you line it up backwards in order.

382
00:20:38,985 --> 00:20:41,085
Monomokidanon...

383
00:20:41,085 --> 00:20:43,585
Momodanonani...

384
00:20:43,585 --> 00:20:45,585
Peach Tree Adventure Squad!

385
00:20:45,585 --> 00:20:47,885
That used to be the name of our group!

386
00:20:47,885 --> 00:20:49,785
We used to frequently gather here.

387
00:20:49,785 --> 00:20:53,685
When we had to wait for each other or when we were practicing "Peach Boy".

388
00:20:55,285 --> 00:20:57,485
This is Shunya's...

389
00:20:58,485 --> 00:21:02,785
Momoi looked so cool in his "Peach Boy" character.

390
00:21:02,785 --> 00:21:06,585
Next time, I'm going to be Peach Boy and rescue Momoi.

391
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:09,885
I'm going to make him stop listening to those guys!

392
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:13,385
But it's got to be kept a secret from teacher or his parents.

393
00:21:13,385 --> 00:21:16,285
No matter what. No matter what.

394
00:21:17,685 --> 00:21:18,785
No way.

395
00:21:20,085 --> 00:21:25,085
Maybe Shunya ran onto the road because he wanted to help you.

396
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:26,885
Stop bullying my friend!

397
00:21:30,585 --> 00:21:33,485
If only I remembered it back then.

398
00:21:33,485 --> 00:21:36,785
I kind of knew, although I was a child

399
00:21:36,785 --> 00:21:39,385
that it was no ordinary traffic accident.

400
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:43,885
But I couldn't say or do anything. I'm just as guilty.

401
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,585
As for me, I didn't feel a thing.

402
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:48,385
So I'm even guiltier.

403
00:21:49,585 --> 00:21:55,485
I probably looked like an ogre.

404
00:21:55,485 --> 00:22:00,685
The ogre in your heart can only be defeated by you yourself alone.

405
00:22:02,385 --> 00:22:05,385
Yes. Because you're Peach Boy.

406
00:23:33,685 --> 00:23:35,385
Lover's...

407
00:23:35,385 --> 00:23:37,285
Just come along.

408
00:23:37,285 --> 00:23:38,585
All right!

409
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:42,485
Now, you're my Peach Boy, Conan!

410
00:23:42,485 --> 00:23:44,485
Bummers.

411
00:23:44,485 --> 00:23:47,085
-Then, what about us? -Then, what about us?

412
00:23:47,085 --> 00:23:48,685
Genta is the pig!

413
00:23:48,685 --> 00:23:50,685
Mitsuhiko is the water sprite!

414
00:23:51,985 --> 00:23:55,085
Those are "Son Goku's" characters.

415
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:58,985
You guys! Then, am I a hot dog?

416
00:24:31,812 --> 00:24:34,412
Next Conan Hint's:

417
00:24:34,412 --> 00:24:36,312
"Outdoor bath"

418
00:24:36,312 --> 00:24:38,912
-A secluded Japanese hot spring inn. -Curse of the kimono?

419
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,612
I don't understand the meaning after all.
