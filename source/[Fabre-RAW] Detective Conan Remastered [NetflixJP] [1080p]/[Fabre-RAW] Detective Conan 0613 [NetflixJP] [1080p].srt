1
00:00:04,925 --> 00:00:06,825
Talking of names.

2
00:00:06,825 --> 00:00:09,989
There's a strange story regarding our names.

3
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:12,425
About your names?

4
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:14,925
I heard that the birth mother

5
00:00:14,925 --> 00:00:16,725
of the late Shinichi who died in Tokyo,

6
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,825
was ordered to change his name just before

7
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:20,625
she was about to register his birth.

8
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,025
Just before?

9
00:00:22,025 --> 00:00:26,925
Yes. At first, his name was the kanji character read Hitoshi.

10
00:00:26,925 --> 00:00:28,325
Why was his name changed?

11
00:00:28,325 --> 00:00:29,525
If I remember correctly,

12
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:31,525
Shinichi told me that it was because

13
00:00:31,525 --> 00:00:34,925
father said that the name Hitoshi was too simple and changed it.

14
00:00:34,925 --> 00:00:36,925
It's true that there are only a few number

15
00:00:36,925 --> 00:00:39,225
of strokes in the Kanji Hitoshi, so it's simple but...

16
00:00:39,225 --> 00:00:42,325
And if Takako were a boy,

17
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:45,225
the kanji character "kou" and "ki"

18
00:00:45,225 --> 00:00:47,325
would've been applied.

19
00:00:47,325 --> 00:00:50,625
If Yoshiya were a girl, his name would've been Yuka

20
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:53,725
with the kanji characters "Yuten Temple" and "flower".

21
00:00:53,725 --> 00:00:56,825
If Tomoaki were a girl, his name would've been Chiharu

22
00:00:56,825 --> 00:00:59,425
with the kanji characters "knowledge" and "spring"

23
00:00:59,425 --> 00:01:03,725
Are the names really those that Chairman Tsunechika chose?

24
00:01:03,725 --> 00:01:09,625
Yes. The late Keiji, Miwako and Saki all said the same thing.

25
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:13,225
There seems to be some kind of secret behind the names.

26
00:01:13,225 --> 00:01:16,425
-Yes. -But is it true that

27
00:01:16,425 --> 00:01:19,125
the story about the culprit being among us, the adopted children,

28
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,037
and that the person is using the demon dog

29
00:01:21,037 --> 00:01:24,063
to eradicate the bloodline of the Inubushi family?

30
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:26,658
We don't know that for sure yet

31
00:01:26,658 --> 00:01:28,858
but it's for sure that someone is using a trick

32
00:01:28,858 --> 00:01:31,558
to commit serial murders!

33
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:34,073
We've already got hints as to the demon dog trick

34
00:01:34,258 --> 00:01:36,358
that's being used too!

35
00:01:36,358 --> 00:01:38,858
What's with this piece of cloth?

36
00:01:38,858 --> 00:01:40,758
It was on the ground near the place Tomoaki

37
00:01:40,758 --> 00:01:43,158
was attacked by the demon dog!

38
00:01:43,158 --> 00:01:46,858
There are no burnt remains or smell of oil

39
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:50,089
but it's for sure that it was used for something.

40
00:01:50,089 --> 00:01:52,558
If you had such evidence on you,

41
00:01:52,558 --> 00:01:55,758
why didn't you take it to the police right away?

42
00:01:55,758 --> 00:01:57,858
Ta... Takako.

43
00:01:57,858 --> 00:02:01,458
We... we were just about to take it to the police.

44
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:03,358
And, Miyuki.

45
00:02:03,358 --> 00:02:05,658
The kettle was left boiling on the portable stove, you know!

46
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,758
Oh, I'm sorry!

47
00:02:07,758 --> 00:02:10,109
I was planning to go right back, you see.

48
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:13,658
Okay, I guess it's time for us to go eat dinner.

49
00:02:13,658 --> 00:02:14,958
I guess so. Before eating,

50
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:19,058
I'd like to ask the guys who were back at the house

51
00:02:19,058 --> 00:02:20,858
what they were doing too.

52
00:02:23,358 --> 00:02:24,958
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

53
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,458
You must be true to yourself.

54
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:28,958
The mystery is completely solved in.

55
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,058
The last chapter of the demon dog series.

56
00:02:31,058 --> 00:02:32,758
He sees through the one and only truth.

57
00:02:32,758 --> 00:02:34,758
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

58
00:02:34,758 --> 00:02:37,658
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

59
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:20,871
The previous head of the household of the Inubushi family,

60
00:04:20,871 --> 00:04:23,371
Tsunechika died five years ago,

61
00:04:23,371 --> 00:04:27,871
and the present head, widowed Satomi is bed-ridden.

62
00:04:27,871 --> 00:04:30,249
If she passes away, the vast estate

63
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:33,471
will be inherited by the eight adopted children.

64
00:04:33,471 --> 00:04:34,971
However, the adopted children

65
00:04:34,971 --> 00:04:37,771
die bizarre deaths one after the other.

66
00:04:37,771 --> 00:04:40,259
Could it be the curse of the demon dog engulfed in flames

67
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:42,871
that is attacking the Inubushi family?

68
00:04:42,871 --> 00:04:47,171
And the demon dog finally appears in front of our eyes.

69
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:49,071
What is the identity of the monster engulfed in flames

70
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:51,571
that attack humans?

71
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:54,971
Who on earth is the one that is manipulating the demon dog?

72
00:04:56,271 --> 00:04:59,071
"Inubushi Castle, The Ablazed Demon Dog"

73
00:04:59,071 --> 00:05:02,071
"(Princess Chapter)"

74
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:07,271
Hey, Ran. Can you solve this problem?

75
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:12,071
"Wear glasses and think it out" is the hint, right?

76
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:14,293
What're you guys doing?

77
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:16,071
We're watching a rerun of a quiz program

78
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:18,297
that is aired late at night.

79
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:20,071
It's pretty interesting.

80
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:22,971
Why don't you go to bed? It's after 01:00 already.

81
00:05:22,971 --> 00:05:25,171
The bed is made in the guest room, right?

82
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:28,571
But, figuring that the demon dog is nearby somewhere.

83
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:31,071
We're too scared to sleep!

84
00:05:31,071 --> 00:05:32,671
Come on.

85
00:05:32,671 --> 00:05:34,871
Can you decipher this code then?

86
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:37,171
If you do, I'll hit the sack for you!

87
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:40,319
Maybe Conan can decipher it! He's wearing glasses besides.

88
00:05:40,471 --> 00:05:44,323
This means that the katakana character of "glasses" (megane).

89
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:47,971
You change the "me" of this code to "ne".

90
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:50,329
The cat in the attic!

91
00:05:51,871 --> 00:05:54,333
I see! Megane means glasses,

92
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,571
so you gotta change "me" to "ne" and read it.

93
00:05:57,571 --> 00:05:59,671
I see.

94
00:05:59,671 --> 00:06:02,341
So, this is what the trick of the demon dog was about.

95
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:04,771
If so, the culprit is...

96
00:06:04,771 --> 00:06:07,671
It couldn't be anyone else but that person.

97
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:09,971
What? You mean, mother?

98
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:11,871
She collapsed?

99
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:16,355
Yeah. It seems that she tried to get out of under the covers.

100
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:20,359
Since Takako heard a strange sound in the corridor,

101
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:21,871
she went inside the room

102
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:24,363
and found Satomi lying on the floor in front of the drawer?

103
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:27,471
-Yes. -It was just when I left to go to the restroom.

104
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:29,771
I wonder how something like this could've happened.

105
00:06:29,771 --> 00:06:31,771
Something's on the floor.

106
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:34,071
They're the beads from the prayer beads.

107
00:06:38,671 --> 00:06:40,071
Tears.

108
00:06:41,971 --> 00:06:43,971
Hey.

109
00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:48,387
She holding on to eight beads.

110
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:51,671
Only the fourth bead from the top is a small bead.

111
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:55,971
Eight. Beads. Dog.

112
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:59,771
I see. It's that story.

113
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:03,071
In other words, Satomi knew...

114
00:07:03,071 --> 00:07:06,871
Who among the people here was the serial killer!

115
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:12,871
Hey. Kazuha.

116
00:07:14,071 --> 00:07:16,171
Kazuha!

117
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:18,417
What's up?

118
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:22,421
Will you go to the restroom with me?

119
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:23,571
Okay!

120
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:26,425
Geez. You're not a kid,

121
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:28,427
so can't you go to the restroom alone or what?

122
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:32,431
But, I was attacked by the demon dog in the yard here, you know.

123
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:35,071
If you think that it may appear in the house this time,

124
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:36,435
it's scary, right?

125
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:39,271
By the way, how come you're awake yourself, Pops?

126
00:07:39,271 --> 00:07:41,571
I'll bet you're concerned too, dad?

127
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:43,371
After all you saw the demon dog too.

128
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:45,771
Sort of.

129
00:07:45,771 --> 00:07:48,871
The glasses kid and the young detective from Osaka

130
00:07:48,871 --> 00:07:52,451
seem to be fast asleep, though.

131
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:53,871
Of course!

132
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:55,371
They were saying something like

133
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:56,471
they've figured out who the culprit is so...

134
00:07:56,471 --> 00:07:57,471
They've...

135
00:07:57,471 --> 00:07:59,771
they've figured out who the culprit is?

136
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,971
You mean they've figured out the culprit

137
00:08:01,971 --> 00:08:03,671
that is among the adopted children?

138
00:08:03,671 --> 00:08:06,465
Yes, although they didn't tell us who it was.

139
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:09,071
They seemed to have come up with a clue

140
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,471
after hearing about the names of the adopted children!

141
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:13,271
Heard about the names?

142
00:08:13,271 --> 00:08:16,171
Like Miyuki's name used to be Tamaki.

143
00:08:16,171 --> 00:08:19,271
If Takako were to be born a boy, her name would've been

144
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:22,271
using the kanji characters "think" and "season".

145
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:25,471
If Yoshiya were born a girl, his name would've been Yuka,

146
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,471
using the kanji characters of "Yuten Temple" and "flower".

147
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:29,471
If Tomoaki were a girl,

148
00:08:29,471 --> 00:08:31,971
his name would've been meaning "know spring", pronounced Chiharu.

149
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:35,571
Oh, and Shinichi who died in Tokyo

150
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:37,871
seems to originally have been named "Jin"

151
00:08:37,871 --> 00:08:39,771
using only one kanji character.

152
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:41,371
Oh.

153
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:44,171
I wonder if it has something to do with the prayer beads

154
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:47,371
that Satomi was holding firmly a while ago, after all?

155
00:08:47,371 --> 00:08:49,371
She was holding prayer beads?

156
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:51,371
It seems she deliberately got out of bed

157
00:08:51,371 --> 00:08:53,971
and was holding the prayer beads that she took out of the drawer!

158
00:08:53,971 --> 00:08:55,871
On top of that, the string seems to have been cut

159
00:08:55,871 --> 00:08:58,517
and there seems to have been only eight beads on the string.

160
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:01,471
Eight beads?

161
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:03,471
Maybe it's some kind of fortunetelling or something?

162
00:09:03,471 --> 00:09:05,171
But, I wonder if there was any type of fortunetelling

163
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:07,371
that used eight beads?

164
00:09:07,371 --> 00:09:12,531
No. It's not fortunetelling, but rather, a story.

165
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:14,071
A story?

166
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:15,671
Eight beads and a demon dog

167
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:20,071
and judging from the names of the people here in the family,

168
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:22,971
the only possibility is the "Eight Dog Chronicles"!

169
00:09:22,971 --> 00:09:25,371
Eight Dog Chronicles?

170
00:09:25,371 --> 00:09:26,871
What's that?

171
00:09:26,871 --> 00:09:29,571
Is it a story that'll help us find something?

172
00:09:29,571 --> 00:09:31,571
You mean you don't know?

173
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,071
It's a famous novel of large volume that was

174
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:37,571
written by Bakin Takizawa, a great writer in the Edo Era!

175
00:09:37,571 --> 00:09:39,071
Attacked by the enemy, Yoshizane Satomi,

176
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,971
who saw the fall of the castle before his eyes,

177
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:42,561
tells his beloved dog Yatsufusa,

178
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:43,971
"If you get me the head of the enemy Shogun,"

179
00:09:43,971 --> 00:09:46,565
"I will give my daughter Princess Fuse to you."

180
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:48,871
Hearing this. Yatsufusa raids the enemy quarters

181
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:52,271
and really brings back the head of the enemy Shogun.

182
00:09:52,271 --> 00:09:53,371
Princess Fuse, after saying,

183
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:57,771
"Be it a dog, a Monarch should always keep to his words,"

184
00:09:57,771 --> 00:10:00,571
"goes along with Yatsufusa and confines herself into the mountains."

185
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:03,371
This is how the first part of the story goes.

186
00:10:03,371 --> 00:10:06,585
What? What's with the dog?

187
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:08,571
I guess it's cursed.

188
00:10:08,571 --> 00:10:10,171
Exactly!

189
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:12,371
The fact is, Yoshizane became the castle lord

190
00:10:12,371 --> 00:10:13,871
after killing the treacherous retainer

191
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:15,671
who killed the original lord of the castle.

192
00:10:15,671 --> 00:10:18,597
When Tamazusa, the wife of the retainer who was killed,

193
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:21,671
was to be beheaded she left behind the following words.

194
00:10:21,671 --> 00:10:25,471
"Even if I were to perish, my soul will remain as a ghostly spirit"

195
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:29,271
"and curse the Satomi family for generations to come!"

196
00:10:29,271 --> 00:10:32,171
Which means that the dog was cursed

197
00:10:32,171 --> 00:10:33,771
by this person called Tamazusa?

198
00:10:33,771 --> 00:10:37,571
Yeah. The curse that was placed on Yatsufusa vanished

199
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:41,571
thanks to the sutra that Princess Fuse kept reading for him but...

200
00:10:41,571 --> 00:10:43,171
And... And?

201
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:45,871
What happened to the princess and dog after that?

202
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:47,471
Yoshizane orders his vassal,

203
00:10:47,471 --> 00:10:51,571
"Get rid of the cursed dog and rescue Princess Fuse."

204
00:10:51,571 --> 00:10:53,771
However, Princess Fuse who tries to protect Yatsufusa,

205
00:10:53,771 --> 00:10:55,771
loses her life.

206
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:58,271
At that time, eight beads from the prayer beads

207
00:10:58,271 --> 00:11:00,639
that the princess had on her, flew to the heavens.

208
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,971
Then, eight warriors with the names of a dog

209
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:04,971
from various districts caught the beads,

210
00:11:04,971 --> 00:11:08,171
and each of them started off with their checkered lives from then on.

211
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:12,651
That's the way the Eight Dog Chronicles go.

212
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:16,171
But how do the names connect?

213
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:21,871
Each of the eight beads had one kanji character inside it.

214
00:11:21,871 --> 00:11:27,171
Jin, Gi, Rei, Chi, Chu, Shin, Kou, Tei.

215
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:28,971
"Jin, Gi, Rei, Chi, Chu, Shin, Kou, Tei"

216
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:32,271
These Jingihakou kanji characters that you see here!

217
00:11:32,271 --> 00:11:34,673
But, those kanji characters aren't included

218
00:11:34,871 --> 00:11:37,071
in the names of the people of the Inubushi family!

219
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:40,679
Shinichi's name used to be "Jin" read Hitoshi,

220
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:43,571
but it seems to have been changed because the name was too simple.

221
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:45,271
It's not because it was too simple.

222
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,971
He avoided it because he didn't like, what you see is what you get!

223
00:11:47,971 --> 00:11:50,271
If you add the person radical

224
00:11:50,271 --> 00:11:53,171
to the two horizontal lines in the character "ichi",

225
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:56,371
it will make the kanji character "Jin".

226
00:11:56,371 --> 00:11:57,671
True.

227
00:11:57,671 --> 00:11:59,971
I see! So, it's not what it actually looks like

228
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:01,471
but he divided the kanji character into parts

229
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,471
and included them in the names!

230
00:12:03,471 --> 00:12:06,705
In Takako's name, the top radical of the kanji character of "kou"

231
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:07,971
and the kanji character "ko" were combined

232
00:12:07,971 --> 00:12:09,871
to make the kanji character "kou".

233
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:12,071
In case she were to be a boy, the name Kouki

234
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:14,713
has the same kanji parts in it!

235
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:18,717
Then, in Yoshiya's case, the radical and the last flick stroke

236
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:19,871
in the kanji character "ya"

237
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:21,171
combines to make the kanji character "rei".

238
00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:25,071
In Tomoaki's name, the hikari in his name was removed

239
00:12:25,071 --> 00:12:27,571
to make the kanji character "chi".

240
00:12:27,571 --> 00:12:30,471
In the case of the late Keiji, the kanji character derived would be "chu",

241
00:12:30,471 --> 00:12:32,731
Miwako, "gi",

242
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:34,733
Saki, "shin",

243
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:38,171
and Chairman Tsunechika, "tei".

244
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:41,071
Then, Satomi is called "princess"

245
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:42,071
because by combining the kanji character "woman"

246
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:43,971
that is at the bottom of "sato" and "mi",

247
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,171
the kanji character "princess" is made, right?

248
00:12:46,171 --> 00:12:49,071
Right! I'm sure that Chairman Tsunechika

249
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:51,071
loved Eight Dog Chronicles,

250
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,751
so he inserted the characters inside the beads,

251
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:54,753
to the names of his children!

252
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:56,755
But what about Miyuki?

253
00:12:56,971 --> 00:12:58,757
I wonder what character it is?

254
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:00,271
It seems the name she had before she was adopted

255
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:04,271
was read "Miyuki" but written with one kanji character.

256
00:13:04,271 --> 00:13:07,471
Then, there's no mistake who the culprit is.

257
00:13:07,471 --> 00:13:09,271
If you remove the top most horizontal line in the

258
00:13:09,271 --> 00:13:10,769
kanji character "Miyuki Tamaki"

259
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:13,071
and combine it with the name she previously had...

260
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:15,371
It becomes "Tamazusa"!

261
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:17,471
That's the name of the ghostly spirit that cursed the Satomi family

262
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:20,371
-in the Eight Dog Chronicles! -What?

263
00:13:20,371 --> 00:13:21,871
Oh, no!

264
00:13:21,871 --> 00:13:24,171
Are you saying that Miyuki is the serial killer

265
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:26,071
who is manipulating the demon dog

266
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,571
and attacking the people of the Inubushi family?

267
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:35,981
Are you saying that Miyuki is the serial killer

268
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,781
who is manipulating the demon dog

269
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:39,981
and attacking the people of the Inubushi family?

270
00:13:39,981 --> 00:13:42,801
Yeah. She's probably reenacting the role of Tamazusa

271
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:45,381
and each time she kills an adopted child,

272
00:13:45,381 --> 00:13:47,081
she leaves a round thing behind at the

273
00:13:47,081 --> 00:13:48,807
site of the crime as proof of what she did.

274
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:50,481
That can't be!

275
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:52,811
Miyuki is a nice person.

276
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:54,581
Just because she's a nice person,

277
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:57,381
it doesn't mean that she's not the culprit.

278
00:13:57,381 --> 00:13:58,817
Oh, no.

279
00:13:58,981 --> 00:14:01,981
Heiji! Heiji, say something!

280
00:14:01,981 --> 00:14:04,381
Miyuki's not the culprit, is she?

281
00:14:04,381 --> 00:14:05,581
Huh?

282
00:14:05,581 --> 00:14:07,681
Heiji's not here.

283
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:12,181
-Conan's not here either! -No joke!

284
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:13,681
Hey.

285
00:14:13,681 --> 00:14:17,281
Didn't Miyuki tell you that she was going to do something tonight?

286
00:14:17,281 --> 00:14:21,381
She said that she was going to Satomi's room to vigil over her.

287
00:14:21,381 --> 00:14:22,841
She was going to tell Satomi not to sneak out

288
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:24,843
from under the covers again.

289
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:30,081
What? Miyuki's whereabouts are unknown?

290
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:34,181
I thought that a vigil would be tough for her

291
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:36,181
so I came into the room to take her place,

292
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:37,981
then I found this letter.

293
00:14:37,981 --> 00:14:40,081
A letter?

294
00:14:40,081 --> 00:14:42,481
I will atone for all the crimes I've committed

295
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:45,581
in the hut where I raised the demon dog.

296
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:47,181
Miyuki.

297
00:14:47,181 --> 00:14:50,281
-Oh, no. -It can't be.

298
00:14:50,281 --> 00:14:51,981
Miyuki...

299
00:14:51,981 --> 00:14:53,481
She is the culprit?

300
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:55,681
Why would she...

301
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:11,481
Isn't that scooter Miyuki's?

302
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:15,981
Hey. Don't tell me that gasoline is leaking from it.

303
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:19,681
And? Who's going to go check?

304
00:15:19,681 --> 00:15:21,581
Not me!

305
00:15:21,581 --> 00:15:23,481
I'm not going either.

306
00:15:23,481 --> 00:15:26,081
Mr. Detective, you go.

307
00:15:26,081 --> 00:15:29,381
If Heiji were here, I'm sure he'd charge in there.

308
00:15:29,381 --> 00:15:32,911
True. I wonder where Conan went too.

309
00:15:38,581 --> 00:15:41,281
-What? -Demon dog? It's appeared!

310
00:15:42,581 --> 00:15:44,181
It's heading for the hut!

311
00:15:44,181 --> 00:15:47,681
Hey, if the gasoline catches fire, the hut and all will blow up.

312
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:52,181
Conan?

313
00:15:52,181 --> 00:15:54,933
-No good! -Run for it!

314
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:09,981
See, it's okay! There's nothing to be afraid of.

315
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:11,981
Huh? It's not burning.

316
00:16:11,981 --> 00:16:14,581
It's just red.

317
00:16:14,581 --> 00:16:19,881
Besides, what's that cloth that's on the dog?

318
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:23,281
-Virtual flames! -Heiji.

319
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:24,963
Virtual flames?

320
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:25,781
"Virtual flames" -It was used on the set

321
00:16:25,781 --> 00:16:28,967
of the TV quiz program that you guys were watching too, right?

322
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:31,481
It's a fake flame that was created by shining red LED light

323
00:16:31,481 --> 00:16:36,081
on glossy cloth that is made to flutter in the wind!

324
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:38,081
The same with that dog!

325
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:41,781
The cloth is wrapped around it so that when it runs,

326
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:42,981
the cloth flutters in the wind.

327
00:16:43,181 --> 00:16:44,581
And a red LED light was wrapped into the cloth

328
00:16:44,581 --> 00:16:48,181
to make the dog look like a demon dog engulfed in flames!

329
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:49,881
If you turn the light off using a remote controller,

330
00:16:49,881 --> 00:16:52,781
the dog will vanish too, you see!

331
00:16:52,781 --> 00:16:56,181
Then, how do you explain the fire footprints?

332
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,781
Okay, watch closely!

333
00:16:57,781 --> 00:16:58,997
A disposable lighter is rigged

334
00:16:59,181 --> 00:17:01,681
so that the place where the gas is in, is left opened

335
00:17:01,681 --> 00:17:04,181
and a piano line is attached to it!

336
00:17:04,181 --> 00:17:08,181
Which means that the thing I smelt when I fell

337
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:10,181
was the smell of the gas of the lighter?

338
00:17:10,181 --> 00:17:13,681
Yeah, gas is originally odorless,

339
00:17:13,681 --> 00:17:15,013
so since it's dangerous left that way,

340
00:17:15,181 --> 00:17:17,015
they're made to smell like rotten onions!

341
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:18,781
When you guys were attacked by the demon dog

342
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:20,481
at the Inubushi residence,

343
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:25,023
because you fell, this lighter got stuck in the ground

344
00:17:25,181 --> 00:17:26,681
and that's why the fire footprints

345
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:28,781
were cut off only in that spot!

346
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:32,781
But, no matter if gas is emitted, if there's no fire...

347
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:35,033
The charcoal stove that is inside the wire netting

348
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:37,781
on the dog's tail is what kindled the fire!

349
00:17:37,781 --> 00:17:40,281
With this on, when the dog moves on top of the lighters,

350
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:41,881
the fire will grow larger and larger.

351
00:17:41,881 --> 00:17:45,043
I'm sure that this dog wasn't attacking people

352
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:48,081
but rather was just following the smell of the lighters

353
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:50,281
that the culprit lined out on the ground.

354
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:54,281
But, after we were attacked in the yard of the house,

355
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:57,055
we saw no lighters like that on the ground.

356
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:59,057
The culprit set it up so that the dog could

357
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:01,481
hold the edge of the piano line in its mouth and return.

358
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,061
After the demon dog disappeared,

359
00:18:03,281 --> 00:18:04,481
the clattering sound that you heard,

360
00:18:04,481 --> 00:18:07,081
which looked like the fire was hopping was that.

361
00:18:07,081 --> 00:18:11,881
Running with this many lighters attached to a piano line,

362
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:14,181
the lighters would get stuck to the bumpy ground

363
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:16,081
and make that sound.

364
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:19,781
But, when Tomoaki was attacked,

365
00:18:19,781 --> 00:18:23,081
his arm caught fire and he got burned, didn't he?

366
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:26,181
Of course he got burnt.

367
00:18:26,181 --> 00:18:29,781
Because he set himself on fire.

368
00:18:30,581 --> 00:18:32,481
He did it in order to make it look like

369
00:18:32,481 --> 00:18:35,093
the demon dog was really engulfed in flames!

370
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:38,281
Then, is Tomoaki the culprit?

371
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:42,181
But, wasn't he attacked by the demon dog?

372
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:45,881
All the dog did was pounce on its owner

373
00:18:45,881 --> 00:18:47,881
because it was happy!

374
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:49,681
While we were in the hut checking things out,

375
00:18:49,681 --> 00:18:51,781
he lined the piano line with the lighters attached to it

376
00:18:51,781 --> 00:18:53,381
that he had hidden in his bag on the ground,

377
00:18:53,381 --> 00:18:55,113
then, he used his dog whistle

378
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:56,781
to summon the dog that he had as a pet

379
00:18:56,781 --> 00:18:59,117
and kept in another hut!

380
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:00,681
After frolicking with the dog

381
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,121
and falling over a blind spot of the bank,

382
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:04,781
he turned off the light of the dog and made it go home

383
00:19:04,781 --> 00:19:07,381
then set fire to his arm!

384
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,481
He put the onion on the spot then,

385
00:19:10,481 --> 00:19:13,131
to camouflage the smell that Kazuha smelt!

386
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:16,581
Which means that the letter left behind by Miyuki

387
00:19:16,581 --> 00:19:19,137
that said she would atone for the crimes she committed...

388
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:22,281
That's probably what Tomoaki wrote!

389
00:19:22,281 --> 00:19:25,581
In order to frame Miyuki up as the culprit!

390
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,281
Then, where is Miyuki?

391
00:19:28,281 --> 00:19:30,681
She was put to sleep and in that hut,

392
00:19:30,681 --> 00:19:33,151
so we moved her to another place.

393
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:37,155
Miyuki was looking for something over here with Tomoaki so...

394
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:40,081
I think she was asked to go look for Satomi's medicine

395
00:19:40,081 --> 00:19:43,181
that Tomoaki said he dropped when he was attacked

396
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:45,581
by the dog or something.

397
00:19:45,581 --> 00:19:47,981
Were... were you watching?

398
00:19:47,981 --> 00:19:52,081
Yeah. I chased you from the house, so I figured it out right away.

399
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:56,281
You took Miyuki who you put to sleep, over to the hut

400
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:58,181
to make it look like she committed suicide

401
00:19:58,181 --> 00:20:00,781
by burning herself along with the demon dog.

402
00:20:00,781 --> 00:20:03,181
Oh, no.

403
00:20:04,981 --> 00:20:07,185
No use playing dumb!

404
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:09,981
Because the dog will never forget its owner!

405
00:20:09,981 --> 00:20:12,181
And the reason Hachi barks at you

406
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:15,193
is probably because you smell like this dog.

407
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:17,981
Besides, Satomi knows all about it!

408
00:20:17,981 --> 00:20:20,281
-What? -Well, you lied saying that

409
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:22,181
you were by her side watching over her right through

410
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:23,881
to establish your alibi,

411
00:20:23,881 --> 00:20:26,181
although it was obvious that your lie would be revealed in time.

412
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:28,981
Satomi was holding the black fourth bead

413
00:20:28,981 --> 00:20:32,381
from the top of all the eight beads.

414
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:34,981
It corresponds to the fourth name Chi,

415
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:37,481
when read in order of Jin, Gi, Rei, Chi, Chu, Shin, Kou, Tei.

416
00:20:37,481 --> 00:20:41,219
In other words, the person who comes fourth Chi, is you, the culprit!

417
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:43,781
The traces of tears on Satomi's cheeks was probably because

418
00:20:43,781 --> 00:20:46,581
she wanted you to be the first to discover what she was doing,

419
00:20:46,581 --> 00:20:49,481
so that you could turn yourself into the police.

420
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:54,281
It was because she didn't want you to commit anymore crime.

421
00:20:56,081 --> 00:21:00,081
I didn't want to let go of

422
00:21:00,081 --> 00:21:03,241
that castle-like Inubushi residence!

423
00:21:06,581 --> 00:21:11,249
But the inheritance tax was too high.

424
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:15,781
That's why in order to increase the amount of inheritance, I...

425
00:21:15,781 --> 00:21:18,481
I just couldn't give up the house filled

426
00:21:18,481 --> 00:21:21,681
with memories of mother Satomi who was kinder than my birth mother.

427
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:24,581
Not that castle.

428
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:29,581
I just couldn't bear giving up that castle!

429
00:22:53,351 --> 00:22:56,481
Well, I did it again, good work for me.

430
00:22:56,481 --> 00:23:00,781
He spit everything out in the interrogation room!

431
00:23:00,781 --> 00:23:02,681
He said he killed the four

432
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,381
because they were not cooperative to keeping the castle.

433
00:23:05,381 --> 00:23:10,181
But, didn't Shinichi give up his right to inheritance?

434
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:11,881
He said that he wanted to make it look like

435
00:23:11,881 --> 00:23:13,371
it was the doings of Tamazusa,

436
00:23:13,371 --> 00:23:15,681
rather than killings committed because of inheritance trouble.

437
00:23:15,681 --> 00:23:17,681
He seems to have honestly thought that

438
00:23:17,681 --> 00:23:22,381
Miyuki was Tamazusa who came to destroy the castle.

439
00:23:22,381 --> 00:23:24,281
Because Satomi collapsed

440
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:27,681
while she was out gathering mountain vegetables with Miyuki.

441
00:23:27,681 --> 00:23:29,981
Oh, no.

442
00:23:29,981 --> 00:23:33,381
I'll protect this castle!

443
00:23:33,381 --> 00:23:35,081
Miyuki?

444
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,781
Because after all,

445
00:23:36,781 --> 00:23:40,081
I'm the princess of this castle, just like mother!

446
00:23:40,081 --> 00:23:42,481
Well, although unlike mother.

447
00:23:42,481 --> 00:23:45,181
You're a pretty crude princess.

448
00:23:45,181 --> 00:23:49,407
My, how rude!

449
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:51,409
No, you're both the same.

450
00:23:51,581 --> 00:23:53,081
If you combine the kanji character "fuse" of Inubushi

451
00:23:53,081 --> 00:23:57,081
and the character "hime" (princess) in your names...

452
00:23:57,081 --> 00:23:59,981
Both are read "Princess Fuse"!

453
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

454
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,160
"Map"

455
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,910
In the next episode, we will be challenging

456
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:08,984
solving the mystery evolving around a diary at a villa

457
00:24:08,984 --> 00:24:10,580
where the sound of a piano playing is heard!
