1
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:06,629
A girl detective?

2
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:09,529
Is she sniffing about around you?

3
00:00:09,529 --> 00:00:10,829
Yeah.

4
00:00:10,829 --> 00:00:12,929
Her name is Masumi Sera.

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,629
It seems that she's been living in the States

6
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:17,029
for the past three years with her parents, though.

7
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:20,029
And she's come back to Japan alone this time.

8
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:23,329
And, did you use Shinichi Kudo's voice in front of that girl

9
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:25,029
and solve a case?

10
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:26,729
Sort of.

11
00:00:26,729 --> 00:00:28,729
I kind of had no other option.

12
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:30,929
Don't tell me that girl

13
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:33,329
is one of the members of the you-know-what organization.

14
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,529
Oh, no. I don't think so.

15
00:00:36,529 --> 00:00:38,429
But...

16
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:41,429
I can't help feeling that I've met her somewhere before.

17
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:42,529
Really?

18
00:00:44,529 --> 00:00:46,929
Quite frustrating.

19
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:48,329
Okay!

20
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,029
I've got some things to do there too

21
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:54,229
so I guess I'll go take a look at what she looks like!

22
00:01:15,029 --> 00:01:16,729
If all cases were men,

23
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:18,529
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

24
00:01:18,529 --> 00:01:20,029
Today, we spend 60 minutes with Heiji!

25
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:21,929
A serious deduction battle!

26
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:23,429
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:25,229
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:27,729
His name is Detective Conan!

29
00:02:49,073 --> 00:02:51,473
"Conan vs. Heiji"

30
00:02:51,473 --> 00:02:54,973
"Deduction Battle Between the Detectives of The East and West"

31
00:03:07,573 --> 00:03:10,073
What're you doing?

32
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:12,873
Acting clearly like a suspicious person or country bumpkin!

33
00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:14,273
I can't help it!

34
00:03:14,273 --> 00:03:17,273
The curry packet that mother asked me to buy for her

35
00:03:17,273 --> 00:03:20,173
is sold exclusively only at family restaurants in Tokyo.

36
00:03:20,173 --> 00:03:22,573
You don't have to look for it now, do you?

37
00:03:22,573 --> 00:03:23,773
Why not look for it later?

38
00:03:23,773 --> 00:03:26,073
But, when we went to Nagano,

39
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:28,373
I ended up forgetting to buy Shinshu Miso too, you know?

40
00:03:28,373 --> 00:03:30,373
I don't want to miss the chance this time.

41
00:03:33,273 --> 00:03:35,373
I'm getting off, off here, let me off!

42
00:03:35,373 --> 00:03:36,673
What's up?

43
00:03:36,673 --> 00:03:38,573
I found the family restaurant!

44
00:03:38,573 --> 00:03:40,173
I'm going to stop by and get it,

45
00:03:40,173 --> 00:03:43,573
so you go on ahead to Pops Kogoro's place!

46
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:45,773
Driver, let me off, quickly!

47
00:03:45,773 --> 00:03:47,173
I mean this is not a taxi, you know.

48
00:03:47,173 --> 00:03:49,273
What makes you think that a bus can stop wherever you want it to.

49
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:57,473
Hey, Kazuha.

50
00:03:58,173 --> 00:04:00,073
See you, Heiji!

51
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,973
Oh, hey, wait.

52
00:04:03,473 --> 00:04:05,873
I tell you, that girl.

53
00:04:05,873 --> 00:04:09,673
Huh? Are Heiji and Kazuha coming here?

54
00:04:09,673 --> 00:04:12,873
Yes, I got a call last night.

55
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:14,973
I wonder what they're coming here?

56
00:04:14,973 --> 00:04:16,473
Could it be a case or something?

57
00:04:16,473 --> 00:04:19,773
I wonder. He said he'd tell me about it when he gets here.

58
00:04:19,773 --> 00:04:21,873
He was also saying something about curry too.

59
00:04:21,873 --> 00:04:23,273
Curry?

60
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:24,373
You mean, Hattori?

61
00:04:24,373 --> 00:04:27,673
Who'd you say did a gorgeous hat trick?

62
00:04:29,673 --> 00:04:31,173
Ms. Sera.

63
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:37,373
The son of the head of the Osaka Prefectural Police Station, eh?

64
00:04:37,373 --> 00:04:39,573
And a high school detective too!

65
00:04:39,573 --> 00:04:40,873
Why, that's fantastic!

66
00:04:40,873 --> 00:04:44,073
Yes, and his name is Heiji Hattori!

67
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:47,973
According to Hattori, it seems that people refer to him side by side

68
00:04:47,973 --> 00:04:50,173
as Hattori of the West and Kudo of the East!

69
00:04:50,173 --> 00:04:52,673
So, he's Kudo's rival!

70
00:04:52,673 --> 00:04:55,773
But, they seemed to have battled only in the beginning

71
00:04:55,773 --> 00:05:00,173
and now they seem to be cooperating with each other to solve cases.

72
00:05:00,173 --> 00:05:03,973
In other words, they are full fledged when they work together.

73
00:05:03,973 --> 00:05:06,073
They cannot come close to the ranking alongside

74
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:08,373
with Japan's greatest detective,

75
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:11,573
the Sleeping Kogoro, you see!

76
00:05:12,773 --> 00:05:15,873
The Sleeping Kogoro is also two working together, you know?

77
00:05:15,873 --> 00:05:17,073
And?

78
00:05:17,073 --> 00:05:19,673
Why is this boy coming here for?

79
00:05:19,673 --> 00:05:20,673
I don't know.

80
00:05:20,673 --> 00:05:23,773
He said he'd tell us when he gets here.

81
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:24,873
He's probably going to

82
00:05:24,873 --> 00:05:27,373
bring some complicated case along with him again.

83
00:05:27,373 --> 00:05:28,473
I hope they cooperate nicely,

84
00:05:28,473 --> 00:05:31,273
the west and the east detectives and solve the case.

85
00:05:31,273 --> 00:05:34,073
East vs. West?

86
00:05:34,073 --> 00:05:36,173
If you were to be honest,

87
00:05:36,173 --> 00:05:38,673
which of the two are renowned detectives?

88
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,373
Oh, I think they are equal.

89
00:05:43,373 --> 00:05:45,373
But...

90
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:46,773
if I had to make a choice,

91
00:05:46,773 --> 00:05:47,773
I think that the detective of the East.

92
00:05:47,773 --> 00:05:48,973
It's the West!

93
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:52,173
I, Heiji Hattori, the high school detective of the west

94
00:05:52,173 --> 00:05:54,773
is way above, I tell you, idiot!

95
00:05:54,773 --> 00:05:55,973
Saying what you like,

96
00:05:55,973 --> 00:05:57,973
thinking that I'm not going to say anything, I tell you.

97
00:05:57,973 --> 00:06:00,473
You mean you were eavesdropping.

98
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:02,773
And? Where's the girl detective

99
00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:08,173
that's suddenly appeared recently sniffing around about Kudo?

100
00:06:08,173 --> 00:06:09,873
She's right here!

101
00:06:09,873 --> 00:06:11,573
This is Masumi Sera!

102
00:06:11,573 --> 00:06:13,973
It's not that I'm sniffing about or anything, though.

103
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:17,573
You're a girl?

104
00:06:17,573 --> 00:06:20,973
But, for a girl, your boobies are sort of a bit teeny-weeny?

105
00:06:20,973 --> 00:06:23,073
Well, it's scheduled to pop out

106
00:06:23,073 --> 00:06:25,973
and get bigger from now on, you see!

107
00:06:25,973 --> 00:06:28,073
Well, mom was seem to have been skinny too,

108
00:06:28,073 --> 00:06:31,373
but seemed to have enough breast size, so I'm not worried, though!

109
00:06:31,373 --> 00:06:32,773
Right, Ran?

110
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:36,573
I've never met her though.

111
00:06:36,573 --> 00:06:39,073
By the way, where's Kazuha?

112
00:06:39,073 --> 00:06:40,773
Wasn't she supposed to come with you?

113
00:06:40,773 --> 00:06:43,973
Yeah, she got off the bus to go shopping.

114
00:06:43,973 --> 00:06:47,073
Kazuha's mother seems to be hooked on the curry packet

115
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,773
that she received as a gift previously.

116
00:06:50,773 --> 00:06:51,873
Moreover, it seems to be curry that

117
00:06:51,873 --> 00:06:54,373
you can only buy exclusively at family restaurants in Tokyo,

118
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:58,373
that her mother asked her to buy it for her while she's here.

119
00:06:58,373 --> 00:07:01,473
She happened to find that family restaurant on our way here.

120
00:07:01,473 --> 00:07:03,773
So, she's coming here after dropping over there?

121
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:06,973
Then, why did you come here, Heiji?

122
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:09,773
Well, the fact is...

123
00:07:09,773 --> 00:07:11,573
Oh, sorry.

124
00:07:11,573 --> 00:07:13,073
It's from Kazuha.

125
00:07:13,873 --> 00:07:15,173
What is it, Kazuha?

126
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:17,373
Did you already buy the curry?

127
00:07:17,373 --> 00:07:19,673
Help, Heiji!

128
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:20,973
What's up?

129
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,573
Didn't you go to the family restaurant?

130
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:25,973
I'm at that family restaurant but...

131
00:07:25,973 --> 00:07:28,073
there's great commotion here

132
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,273
because somebody seems to have died in the restroom!

133
00:07:30,273 --> 00:07:33,273
Somebody died?

134
00:07:33,273 --> 00:07:34,473
Is it a homicide?

135
00:07:34,473 --> 00:07:36,973
I don't know yet.

136
00:07:36,973 --> 00:07:40,773
A strange foreign man told us not to leave the store,

137
00:07:40,773 --> 00:07:42,073
so I can't go out.

138
00:07:42,073 --> 00:07:45,673
Okay! I'll be right over, so you wait there!

139
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,473
So, I guess I gotta go.

140
00:07:48,473 --> 00:07:50,373
Okay, so why don't we do this?

141
00:07:51,073 --> 00:07:54,573
How about deciding which is better,

142
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:58,473
the West or the East, with this case?

143
00:07:58,473 --> 00:08:01,073
Of course, you work on your own, Heiji

144
00:08:01,073 --> 00:08:02,173
and as for Kudo,

145
00:08:02,173 --> 00:08:04,673
if Conan tells him the circumstances,

146
00:08:04,673 --> 00:08:06,373
he can join the match, right?

147
00:08:06,373 --> 00:08:08,373
Well, I won't force you to do this

148
00:08:08,373 --> 00:08:11,873
if you and Kudo are such good friends

149
00:08:11,873 --> 00:08:15,473
that you don't want to battle against each other, but...

150
00:08:15,473 --> 00:08:17,273
What're you talking about?

151
00:08:17,273 --> 00:08:19,373
It's a great opportunity.

152
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:23,173
Let's decide, which one of us, Kudo or me is a great detective.

153
00:08:23,173 --> 00:08:25,273
It's about time we make things clear!

154
00:08:33,837 --> 00:08:35,737
Okay, then this is the story, right?

155
00:08:35,737 --> 00:08:39,237
When Kazuha was buying the curry at the restaurant,

156
00:08:39,237 --> 00:08:43,137
a foreign man suddenly came out of the restroom

157
00:08:43,137 --> 00:08:46,537
and said that a man is dead so call the police, right?

158
00:08:46,537 --> 00:08:49,037
Yes. The restroom's been closed off,

159
00:08:49,037 --> 00:08:50,437
and we're told that just to be safe,

160
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:52,937
no one should leave the restaurant!

161
00:08:52,937 --> 00:08:56,237
Did that foreigner say that in English?

162
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:57,837
It was in Japanese!

163
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:00,837
He was the first to find the dead man!

164
00:09:00,837 --> 00:09:03,337
A guy who speaks fluent Japanese,

165
00:09:03,337 --> 00:09:05,937
and the first to find the corpse.

166
00:09:05,937 --> 00:09:08,037
That guy is suspicious.

167
00:09:08,037 --> 00:09:10,537
Well, as far as we're concerned,

168
00:09:10,537 --> 00:09:13,137
you guys who keep coming to the scene of the crime

169
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:15,637
every time something happens is even more suspicious, you see.

170
00:09:15,637 --> 00:09:18,337
Inspector Megure!

171
00:09:18,337 --> 00:09:21,837
Well, recently, as soon as we get to the crime site,

172
00:09:21,837 --> 00:09:24,737
the officer takes it for granted that you called us

173
00:09:24,737 --> 00:09:26,637
and lets us right through.

174
00:09:28,237 --> 00:09:30,737
And what is the cause of death?

175
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,337
He was poisoned.

176
00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:34,537
A candy drop laced with hydrogen cyanide

177
00:09:34,537 --> 00:09:37,237
was found inside the mouth of the victim

178
00:09:37,237 --> 00:09:38,737
and the same candy drop

179
00:09:38,737 --> 00:09:40,837
was also found inside the pocket of the corpse.

180
00:09:40,837 --> 00:09:43,637
So, it may be suicide, then?

181
00:09:43,637 --> 00:09:48,137
Yes, the foreigner who found him said so.

182
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:51,637
Who is he? The foreigner.

183
00:09:51,637 --> 00:09:54,037
He seems to be at home at the scene of the crime, so...

184
00:09:54,037 --> 00:09:58,837
Well, I guess you can say he's sort of connected to the police.

185
00:09:58,837 --> 00:10:01,137
So, you're here too.

186
00:10:01,137 --> 00:10:05,137
A foreigner of large physique, who speaks fluent Japanese.

187
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,937
Someone who's used to places like these

188
00:10:06,937 --> 00:10:10,037
and is connected to the police...

189
00:10:10,037 --> 00:10:13,637
Oh! That foreigner is probably...

190
00:10:13,637 --> 00:10:14,837
Yes.

191
00:10:15,937 --> 00:10:18,237
I acted on impulse.

192
00:10:18,237 --> 00:10:21,337
Just as I thought, Investigator Camel!

193
00:10:21,337 --> 00:10:22,837
Investigator?

194
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:25,637
You mean you know this evil-looking foreigner?

195
00:10:25,637 --> 00:10:26,837
Heiji!

196
00:10:26,837 --> 00:10:29,437
How rude can you get being honest saying that

197
00:10:29,437 --> 00:10:30,837
he's evil looking!

198
00:10:30,837 --> 00:10:34,537
Kazuha, I think you're being just as rude...

199
00:10:34,537 --> 00:10:36,937
More than that, what do you mean investigator?

200
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:38,437
He's an FBI agent!

201
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:39,637
FBI?

202
00:10:39,637 --> 00:10:40,637
Yeah.

203
00:10:40,637 --> 00:10:42,737
He's on vacation right now

204
00:10:42,737 --> 00:10:44,837
and is in Japan on a trip right now, right?

205
00:10:44,837 --> 00:10:46,437
Yeah.

206
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,437
I just couldn't forget the taste of the curry

207
00:10:48,437 --> 00:10:51,337
that I ate with my friend when I was previously in Japan,

208
00:10:51,337 --> 00:10:54,637
so I came to eat it alone, then I ran into this case.

209
00:10:54,637 --> 00:10:57,537
Is this curry that delicious?

210
00:10:57,537 --> 00:10:59,337
Okay, so if it's okay with you,

211
00:10:59,337 --> 00:11:01,637
I'd like you to give us the details of

212
00:11:01,637 --> 00:11:03,637
when you found the corpse in the toilet.

213
00:11:03,637 --> 00:11:06,137
Normally I'd refuse,

214
00:11:06,137 --> 00:11:08,537
but since we're always indebted to you...

215
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:09,537
Camel!

216
00:11:09,537 --> 00:11:12,437
Could you please explain the situation to them one more time?

217
00:11:12,437 --> 00:11:15,937
Okay then, let's go to the restroom where the crime took place.

218
00:11:15,937 --> 00:11:17,337
Oh?

219
00:11:17,337 --> 00:11:19,337
The FBI.

220
00:11:36,037 --> 00:11:38,837
Wasn't Mr. Camel with you?

221
00:11:38,837 --> 00:11:42,137
Well, he said that he wanted to go eat the curry

222
00:11:42,137 --> 00:11:45,537
that he ate at a family restaurant before and left.

223
00:11:45,537 --> 00:11:49,537
Oh, is that curry that delicious?

224
00:11:49,637 --> 00:11:53,037
Beats me, because I haven't eaten it.

225
00:11:56,737 --> 00:11:58,437
Talk about the devil.

226
00:11:58,437 --> 00:12:00,437
It's mail from Camel.

227
00:12:02,237 --> 00:12:04,737
Is something the matter?

228
00:12:04,737 --> 00:12:06,037
Well...

229
00:12:09,837 --> 00:12:11,237
I tell you.

230
00:12:11,237 --> 00:12:12,737
He didn't have to go

231
00:12:12,737 --> 00:12:16,037
and commit suicide in a place like this of all places.

232
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:17,937
And?

233
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,337
Has this man been identified?

234
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:22,837
No, he had nothing on him

235
00:12:22,837 --> 00:12:25,237
that would serve as identification.

236
00:12:25,237 --> 00:12:27,537
The cell phone that would've served as evidence

237
00:12:27,537 --> 00:12:30,437
was found floating in the water of the toilet.

238
00:12:30,437 --> 00:12:32,937
Where were you, Agent Camel?

239
00:12:32,937 --> 00:12:34,837
I was doing my thing

240
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,137
in that toilet compartment two doors away from here.

241
00:12:37,137 --> 00:12:40,137
Then, what do you base your deduction

242
00:12:40,137 --> 00:12:41,137
that this was a suicide on?

243
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:43,537
I heard a voice saying.

244
00:12:43,537 --> 00:12:45,637
"No matter if you're my childhood friend,"

245
00:12:45,637 --> 00:12:48,037
"I can't help you on that."

246
00:12:48,037 --> 00:12:49,937
"I'm the one who laced poison on what Abe-chan ate"

247
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:51,137
"and killed him."

248
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:54,237
"So, I have to take responsibility for my actions."

249
00:12:54,237 --> 00:12:55,937
As soon as he finished talking,

250
00:12:55,937 --> 00:12:58,537
I heard a groan.

251
00:12:58,537 --> 00:13:02,837
I rushed out of the toilet and this is what I saw.

252
00:13:02,837 --> 00:13:06,537
So you rushed out of the toilet, closed this place off

253
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:09,337
and confined the customers in the store, eh?

254
00:13:09,337 --> 00:13:10,437
Yes.

255
00:13:10,437 --> 00:13:12,737
According to the contents of his conversation,

256
00:13:12,737 --> 00:13:15,037
he seems to have been talking with someone from here.

257
00:13:15,037 --> 00:13:16,937
Since he could've wanted to admit to his crime

258
00:13:16,937 --> 00:13:19,937
and turn himself into the police,

259
00:13:19,937 --> 00:13:24,837
that someone he was talking to could've tried to shut him up.

260
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:29,337
But, recalling that he was eating alone

261
00:13:29,337 --> 00:13:31,137
and taking into consideration that

262
00:13:31,137 --> 00:13:33,637
I couldn't hear the voice of the person

263
00:13:33,637 --> 00:13:35,637
on the other side of the line.

264
00:13:35,637 --> 00:13:36,837
The person on the other end

265
00:13:36,837 --> 00:13:38,137
tried to stop the person from committing suicide,

266
00:13:38,137 --> 00:13:40,237
but he probably didn't listen

267
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:41,737
and committed suicide

268
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,037
after repenting the murder he had committed

269
00:13:43,037 --> 00:13:44,837
is what I conclude.

270
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:48,237
Was that voice really this man's voice?

271
00:13:48,237 --> 00:13:50,437
No doubt about that.

272
00:13:50,437 --> 00:13:51,537
This person's seat

273
00:13:51,537 --> 00:13:54,737
just happened to be right in front of mine.

274
00:13:54,737 --> 00:13:57,537
He order it quite a loud voice.

275
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,937
So, I guess it is suicide.

276
00:14:00,937 --> 00:14:02,437
Yes.

277
00:14:02,437 --> 00:14:04,437
But, a case in which that Mr. Abe

278
00:14:04,437 --> 00:14:08,437
was poisoned to death couldn't be found in Tokyo.

279
00:14:08,537 --> 00:14:11,537
So, I'm having the other prefectures

280
00:14:11,537 --> 00:14:13,837
check on this case for me right now.

281
00:14:13,837 --> 00:14:15,237
I think that person called Abe

282
00:14:15,237 --> 00:14:19,237
had quite intimate relationship with this person who died.

283
00:14:19,337 --> 00:14:22,137
Because he used the suffix "chan" when calling him.

284
00:14:22,137 --> 00:14:24,637
Then, you mean he said, "Abe-chan"?

285
00:14:24,637 --> 00:14:25,837
Yeah.

286
00:14:25,837 --> 00:14:28,337
Didn't you notice anything else?

287
00:14:28,337 --> 00:14:30,637
Maybe you might not have been able to tell,

288
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:33,237
but whether he spoke with a dialect or something.

289
00:14:33,237 --> 00:14:34,737
Come to think of it.

290
00:14:34,737 --> 00:14:37,237
He talked just like this young man over here!

291
00:14:37,237 --> 00:14:38,637
Huh? Me?

292
00:14:38,637 --> 00:14:41,037
Are you saying he was speaking in the Kansai dialect then?

293
00:14:41,037 --> 00:14:44,137
I don't know if you call it the Kansai dialect,

294
00:14:44,137 --> 00:14:46,637
but he used the sounds "ya" and "de"

295
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:48,337
at the end of his sentences.

296
00:14:48,337 --> 00:14:51,737
Then, that Abe-chan poisoned to death incident,

297
00:14:51,737 --> 00:14:54,937
may have taken place in the Kansai District.

298
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,837
-Check it out right away! -Yes, sir!

299
00:15:00,137 --> 00:15:01,437
What?

300
00:15:01,437 --> 00:15:05,737
-Is something on my face or what? -Oh, no.

301
00:15:05,737 --> 00:15:08,437
If you're wondering if I'm a boy or a girl,

302
00:15:08,437 --> 00:15:10,737
the correct answer is, a girl!

303
00:15:14,937 --> 00:15:17,237
Although my boobies aren't sticking out yet!

304
00:15:20,437 --> 00:15:24,037
She sure looks familiar.

305
00:15:24,037 --> 00:15:25,637
I wonder what's going on?

306
00:15:25,637 --> 00:15:27,737
Beats me, a homicide?

307
00:15:27,737 --> 00:15:29,337
I'm hungry.

308
00:15:29,337 --> 00:15:30,737
Yes.

309
00:15:30,737 --> 00:15:33,137
I wonder if Heiji and the others are still going to be taking a while.

310
00:15:33,137 --> 00:15:34,437
Maybe.

311
00:15:34,437 --> 00:15:37,737
Looking at the menu is making me drool, that this is bad.

312
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:40,737
Then would you like an ame-chan (candy drop)?

313
00:15:40,737 --> 00:15:42,237
"Ame-chan"?

314
00:15:42,237 --> 00:15:44,037
A candy drop!

315
00:15:47,137 --> 00:15:48,737
Hey. Kudo.

316
00:15:48,737 --> 00:15:52,437
How far do you have this case solved?

317
00:15:52,437 --> 00:15:54,437
Not at all yet.

318
00:15:54,437 --> 00:15:57,337
Well, but if an incident of a person called Abe

319
00:15:57,337 --> 00:16:00,937
being poisoned to death is found in the Kansai District,

320
00:16:00,937 --> 00:16:03,237
then we might find something.

321
00:16:03,237 --> 00:16:04,837
I see.

322
00:16:08,137 --> 00:16:10,437
If so, I'm a step in the lead!

323
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,937
You mean... don't tell me, you...

324
00:16:12,937 --> 00:16:14,737
Yeah! I figured out that

325
00:16:14,737 --> 00:16:18,737
the man didn't commit suicide but was killed.

326
00:16:18,737 --> 00:16:23,237
And that the culprit is still inside this family restaurant!

327
00:16:31,465 --> 00:16:33,865
It's not suicide?

328
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:36,365
Just how do you know?

329
00:16:36,365 --> 00:16:39,365
That's because, Kudo...

330
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:43,765
I'm more of a great detective than you!

331
00:16:43,765 --> 00:16:45,065
You idiot!

332
00:16:45,065 --> 00:16:47,865
Okay, you're better than me,

333
00:16:47,865 --> 00:16:49,865
so tell me your deduction!

334
00:16:49,865 --> 00:16:51,265
Huh?

335
00:16:51,265 --> 00:16:53,865
What was that?

336
00:16:53,865 --> 00:16:57,165
Your voice is so soft, I couldn't hear very well.

337
00:16:57,165 --> 00:17:00,165
Like I said, tell me why you think so.

338
00:17:00,165 --> 00:17:02,165
It's what you said before that.

339
00:17:03,465 --> 00:17:05,465
You're...

340
00:17:05,465 --> 00:17:07,465
You're better than me.

341
00:17:10,165 --> 00:17:11,865
Absolutely!

342
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,665
Unless, I who is way above you explains,

343
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:17,465
you can't understand, can you, sonny?

344
00:17:19,265 --> 00:17:22,965
He really gets me mad.

345
00:17:22,965 --> 00:17:24,065
Okay, then.

346
00:17:24,065 --> 00:17:26,365
Try recalling carefully what happened during the time

347
00:17:26,365 --> 00:17:29,065
-the incident occurred. -The situation.

348
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:31,665
When Agent Camel was doing his thing

349
00:17:31,665 --> 00:17:33,765
in the toilet of the family restaurant,

350
00:17:33,765 --> 00:17:35,865
he coincidentally heard the voice of a man

351
00:17:35,865 --> 00:17:38,965
two doors away from where he was hinting on a possible suicide.

352
00:17:38,965 --> 00:17:40,765
So he rushed over to check things out,

353
00:17:40,765 --> 00:17:43,665
and found a man with a hydrogen cyanide laced candy drop

354
00:17:43,665 --> 00:17:46,465
in his mouth lying dead, right?

355
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,665
What did the voice that hinted on possible suicide say?

356
00:17:49,665 --> 00:17:50,965
Let's see.

357
00:17:50,965 --> 00:17:52,965
"No matter if you're my childhood friend,"

358
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:55,165
"I can't help you on that."

359
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:57,365
"I'm the one who laced poison on what Abe-san ate"

360
00:17:57,365 --> 00:17:58,665
"and killed him."

361
00:17:58,665 --> 00:18:01,965
"So, I have to take responsibility for my actions."

362
00:18:01,965 --> 00:18:04,765
It's not Abe-san, but Abe-chan!

363
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:06,265
Don't get it wrong!

364
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:08,065
It doesn't matter, does it?

365
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:09,565
Just tell me quick!

366
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:14,365
You already heard that the man spoke in a Kansai dialect, right?

367
00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:15,565
Yeah.

368
00:18:15,565 --> 00:18:17,765
If you say what was said just now in Kansai dialect,

369
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:19,065
it would be...

370
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:21,665
"No matter if you're my childhood friend,"

371
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:24,165
"I can't help you on that."

372
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:25,965
"I'm the one who laced poison on what Abe-chan ate"

373
00:18:25,965 --> 00:18:27,365
"and killed him."

374
00:18:27,365 --> 00:18:31,665
"So, I have to take responsibility for my actions."

375
00:18:31,665 --> 00:18:34,065
Right, that's it. He spoke in that fashion!

376
00:18:34,065 --> 00:18:37,965
What heard was exactly as he said it just now!

377
00:18:37,965 --> 00:18:41,365
See? Just like I said, the only way you can look at it is,

378
00:18:41,365 --> 00:18:44,065
the man who died, confessed that he poisoned someone to death

379
00:18:44,065 --> 00:18:45,865
and committed suicide to take responsibility

380
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:47,765
for what he did, right?

381
00:18:47,765 --> 00:18:49,165
Oh, well, no...

382
00:18:49,165 --> 00:18:50,865
What he said just now probably...

383
00:18:50,865 --> 00:18:52,165
If it was spoken in the Kansai dialect,

384
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:55,665
what he meant by "jibun"(me) was actually "you".

385
00:18:55,665 --> 00:18:57,665
Huh? Why?

386
00:18:57,665 --> 00:19:00,765
In Japanese the word "jibun" means "me", right?

387
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,565
Why does it mean "you?"

388
00:19:02,565 --> 00:19:05,265
For example, the phrase, "Temaedomo no sekinin desu."

389
00:19:05,265 --> 00:19:07,865
The word "temae" in this case means ourselves, but...

390
00:19:07,865 --> 00:19:10,065
when you say "temae" is used in fighting,

391
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,365
you're addressing the opponent.

392
00:19:12,365 --> 00:19:14,565
So you see, Japanese is a bit complicated!

393
00:19:14,565 --> 00:19:18,365
In other words, if you replace "me" with "you"...

394
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:21,865
"You're the one who poisoned Abe-chan to death!"

395
00:19:21,865 --> 00:19:25,065
"If so, you have no choice but to take responsibility for it!"

396
00:19:25,065 --> 00:19:26,965
It would turn out like so...

397
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,065
So, the man that died

398
00:19:29,065 --> 00:19:32,365
wasn't confessing that he committed a crime...

399
00:19:32,365 --> 00:19:34,365
But was criticizing the other person whom commited the crime

400
00:19:34,365 --> 00:19:36,665
and most likely was trying to persuade the person

401
00:19:36,665 --> 00:19:38,065
to turn himself into the police.

402
00:19:38,065 --> 00:19:40,165
By the way, the "motte" in the phrase

403
00:19:40,165 --> 00:19:42,465
"Abe-chan ni doku motte" (laced what Abe-chan ate with poison).

404
00:19:42,465 --> 00:19:44,865
Didn't you mistake it and hear it as, "nutte" (smear)?

405
00:19:44,865 --> 00:19:46,465
Yeah.

406
00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:50,365
But, it's strange that someone would smear poison on someone else,

407
00:19:50,365 --> 00:19:52,965
so I thought you misheard the word.

408
00:19:52,965 --> 00:19:56,965
If so, that Abe-chan is not a person's name

409
00:19:56,965 --> 00:19:58,665
but rather, "ame-chan",

410
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:00,465
in other words, a candy drop!

411
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,565
A candy drop?

412
00:20:02,565 --> 00:20:05,865
This candy drop is good, isn't it?

413
00:20:05,865 --> 00:20:08,065
The guy who was found dead in the toilet

414
00:20:08,065 --> 00:20:11,565
also had a candy drop in his mouth.

415
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:16,165
I see, so he misheard "ame-chan" for "Abe-chan".

416
00:20:16,165 --> 00:20:18,565
They do sound alike for sure.

417
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:19,765
But...

418
00:20:19,765 --> 00:20:22,365
why would anyone put the suffix "chan" on the word candy?

419
00:20:22,365 --> 00:20:26,065
Like we've been saying, Japanese is complicated!

420
00:20:26,065 --> 00:20:28,665
"Ame-chan" is only exclusively used in the Kansai District.

421
00:20:28,665 --> 00:20:30,665
But if so,

422
00:20:30,665 --> 00:20:32,765
doesn't that mean there was a culprit in the restroom

423
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:35,265
who made the man take the poisoned candy into his mouth?

424
00:20:35,265 --> 00:20:36,265
Yeah.

425
00:20:36,265 --> 00:20:37,965
The fact that this FBI agent

426
00:20:37,965 --> 00:20:41,165
didn't hear the culprit's voice means that...

427
00:20:41,165 --> 00:20:44,665
Most probably, he was scheduled to see the person

428
00:20:44,665 --> 00:20:47,665
he was urging to turn himself in

429
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:49,465
but instead of sitting in the same seat, the culprit

430
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:50,865
called the man out to the toilet using the cell phone,

431
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:53,465
and later poisoned him to death!

432
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:55,565
If he succeeds in luring the man out using the cell phone,

433
00:20:55,565 --> 00:20:56,865
all the culprit had left to do was to shove

434
00:20:56,865 --> 00:20:58,565
the poisoned candy drop into the victim's mouth.

435
00:20:58,565 --> 00:21:00,365
He wouldn't have to talk at all.

436
00:21:00,365 --> 00:21:02,965
And if he sinks the cell phone into the toilet bowl,

437
00:21:02,965 --> 00:21:05,865
the data would disappear too.

438
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:08,765
But, what the culprit didn't expect was that

439
00:21:08,765 --> 00:21:12,565
an FBI agent coincidentally happened to be in that toilet

440
00:21:12,565 --> 00:21:15,765
and swiftly confined the customers inside the store.

441
00:21:15,765 --> 00:21:16,765
In other words,

442
00:21:16,765 --> 00:21:20,765
the murderer is still inside this store, right?

443
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,065
Okay!

444
00:21:24,065 --> 00:21:27,465
Narrow down the suspects to men in their 30's and 40's

445
00:21:27,465 --> 00:21:29,365
and start interrogating them one by one!

446
00:21:29,365 --> 00:21:31,165
If he is a childhood friend of the victim,

447
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,065
he would be about that age!

448
00:21:33,065 --> 00:21:34,265
Yes, sir!

449
00:21:35,165 --> 00:21:37,465
So...

450
00:21:37,465 --> 00:21:41,965
I'm a step ahead of him so far!

451
00:21:41,965 --> 00:21:43,165
Him?

452
00:21:43,165 --> 00:21:46,165
I thought your match was with Kudo?

453
00:21:46,165 --> 00:21:47,865
Like, I'm saying that

454
00:21:47,865 --> 00:21:50,965
I'm more ahead than Kudo who is behind this brat!

455
00:21:50,965 --> 00:21:52,865
This brat tells me about

456
00:21:52,865 --> 00:21:56,765
the deductions Kudo tell him about with a sassy look

457
00:21:56,765 --> 00:21:59,265
that I sometimes get the impression

458
00:21:59,265 --> 00:22:00,665
that he's Kudo himself!

459
00:22:02,565 --> 00:22:03,765
Well...

460
00:22:03,765 --> 00:22:07,465
I'm sorry but I got this case.

461
00:22:07,465 --> 00:22:11,965
If the culprit was the childhood friend of the man who fell victim,

462
00:22:11,965 --> 00:22:14,565
the culprit is also probably from the Kansai area!

463
00:22:14,565 --> 00:22:15,665
Therefore, even if there are things

464
00:22:15,665 --> 00:22:17,765
that Kudo who is an Edoite cannot understand,

465
00:22:17,765 --> 00:22:22,265
for me, who is from Kansai, it would be duck soup!

466
00:22:27,365 --> 00:22:28,665
I tell you.

467
00:22:28,665 --> 00:22:32,265
Camel really has a way of getting involved with all sorts of cases.

468
00:22:32,265 --> 00:22:33,265
Yes.

469
00:22:33,265 --> 00:22:36,165
We're investigating secretly without telling

470
00:22:36,165 --> 00:22:38,865
the Japanese police of what we're doing and yet...

471
00:22:40,565 --> 00:22:43,465
Huh? From Camel?

472
00:22:43,465 --> 00:22:44,565
Yes.

473
00:22:44,565 --> 00:22:48,865
But the only thing he sent is a photo from his cell phone.

474
00:22:48,865 --> 00:22:50,465
A boy?

475
00:22:56,428 --> 00:22:58,028
Three?

476
00:22:58,028 --> 00:23:00,228
You mean the suspects were narrowed down to three?

477
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:01,728
Yeah.

478
00:23:01,728 --> 00:23:05,128
There were seven male customers who fit, but...

479
00:23:05,128 --> 00:23:07,628
Four of them had someone with them

480
00:23:07,628 --> 00:23:09,228
and when Mr. Camel came out of the restroom

481
00:23:09,228 --> 00:23:11,528
and announced that someone is dead,

482
00:23:11,528 --> 00:23:14,328
all four of them were either placing their orders,

483
00:23:14,328 --> 00:23:16,328
or having the food that their children

484
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,128
had dropped cleaned up.

485
00:23:18,128 --> 00:23:21,228
They were in some way interacting with the waitresses.

486
00:23:23,328 --> 00:23:24,928
The only ones that don't have an alibi

487
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,828
seem to be those three that came alone

488
00:23:26,828 --> 00:23:30,828
and were eating in the smoking seat area.

489
00:23:32,428 --> 00:23:35,728
Then, let me interrogate them!

490
00:23:35,728 --> 00:23:37,628
Don't be ridiculous!

491
00:23:37,628 --> 00:23:39,928
Why would I let a high school boy like you...

492
00:23:39,928 --> 00:23:42,728
The culprit could be a person from Kansai, right?

493
00:23:42,728 --> 00:23:45,328
If so, the culprit may give himself away

494
00:23:45,328 --> 00:23:47,728
if I ask him questions in the Kansai dialect.

495
00:23:52,628 --> 00:23:56,028
My name's Rakutoshi Sugai.

496
00:23:56,028 --> 00:23:58,828
I live in a condo in Beika Street.

497
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:01,828
And, where's your homeland?

498
00:24:01,828 --> 00:24:06,928
I was born and raised in Tokyo.

499
00:24:06,928 --> 00:24:09,528
What is this?

500
00:24:09,528 --> 00:24:12,028
What's with this boy anyway, officer?

501
00:24:12,028 --> 00:24:14,528
Well, don't let yourself be bothered by it

502
00:24:14,528 --> 00:24:17,928
and answer his questions.

503
00:24:17,928 --> 00:24:22,428
You've been sweating a lot for a while now but...

504
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:24,928
don't tell me you're hiding something?

505
00:24:24,928 --> 00:24:27,328
Oh no, this is...

506
00:24:27,328 --> 00:24:28,428
This curry that I ate

507
00:24:28,428 --> 00:24:29,928
was more hot and spicy than I expected, you see.

508
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:31,428
Huh?

509
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:34,628
The incident occurred just about an hour ago, you know.

510
00:24:34,628 --> 00:24:37,728
You should've finished eating it long before?

511
00:24:37,728 --> 00:24:40,428
I just ate it!

512
00:24:40,428 --> 00:24:42,328
Since you wouldn't let us out of here,

513
00:24:42,328 --> 00:24:43,828
for quite some time I started getting hungry.

514
00:24:43,828 --> 00:24:45,628
So, I ordered just a while ago.

515
00:24:45,628 --> 00:24:47,628
A person is dead and I can't see

516
00:24:47,628 --> 00:24:50,128
how they have the nerve to take the order.

517
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:56,428
I'm Tohru Amakasu.

518
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,628
My friends call me Ama.

519
00:24:58,628 --> 00:25:01,728
I live in an apartment in Haido Street now.

520
00:25:01,728 --> 00:25:05,028
And, was born and raised in Tokyo.

521
00:25:05,028 --> 00:25:08,128
Are you satisfied now, young man from Osaka?

522
00:25:08,128 --> 00:25:11,028
You seem to be sweating a lot too.

523
00:25:11,028 --> 00:25:15,028
-You scared or something? -I'm not scared.

524
00:25:15,028 --> 00:25:18,328
Cut out the nonsense.

525
00:25:18,328 --> 00:25:21,028
What's with him, getting scared all of a sudden?

526
00:25:21,028 --> 00:25:24,228
He may be more timid and shy than I expected?

527
00:25:24,228 --> 00:25:26,028
Of all things!

528
00:25:26,028 --> 00:25:27,928
It's just that the ramen that I ate a while ago

529
00:25:27,928 --> 00:25:30,428
was so spicy hot!

530
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:32,028
Hey, you.

531
00:25:32,028 --> 00:25:34,028
Rather, the way you're talking...

532
00:25:34,028 --> 00:25:36,628
Huh? What's wrong?

533
00:25:36,628 --> 00:25:38,528
I'm talking in ordinary Tokyo dialect, aren't I?

534
00:25:38,528 --> 00:25:41,128
Nothing's wrong.

535
00:25:41,128 --> 00:25:43,528
But, it's annoying, idiot.

536
00:25:43,528 --> 00:25:46,128
Hot spicy ramen?

537
00:25:47,328 --> 00:25:50,328
I'm a resident of Beika Street.

538
00:25:50,328 --> 00:25:52,828
My name's Sanpei Tojo.

539
00:25:52,828 --> 00:25:56,528
This interrogation is voluntary, isn't it?

540
00:25:56,528 --> 00:25:58,828
Why do I have to go as far as to tell you

541
00:25:58,828 --> 00:26:00,528
about my upbringing?

542
00:26:00,528 --> 00:26:04,928
Moreover, to be asked such by a random boy...

543
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:08,128
If you don't want to tell me, you don't have to tell me anything.

544
00:26:08,128 --> 00:26:10,328
But, it'll only make you look more suspicious.

545
00:26:10,328 --> 00:26:13,328
Unlike you, I'm an Edoite of three generations.

546
00:26:13,328 --> 00:26:14,928
Huh?

547
00:26:14,928 --> 00:26:17,828
You look to be sweating a lot too?

548
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:19,728
Don't tell me you're going to say,

549
00:26:19,728 --> 00:26:22,028
you're perspiring because you ate that Mabo Tofu

550
00:26:22,028 --> 00:26:24,628
that you hardly even ate.

551
00:26:24,628 --> 00:26:27,528
I'm just prone to perspire a lot!

552
00:26:27,528 --> 00:26:31,328
Besides, I'm not so audacious that I can eat

553
00:26:31,328 --> 00:26:33,728
knowing that someone just died, you see.

554
00:26:33,728 --> 00:26:35,828
That's why I even quit eating the sweets

555
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:38,028
that I was planning to eat for dessert too.

556
00:26:38,028 --> 00:26:40,628
Well, I think it was a good choice that you quit.

557
00:26:40,628 --> 00:26:43,128
Since sweets will make you fat.

558
00:26:46,928 --> 00:26:52,028
And, did you find anyone from Kansai among the three?

559
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:53,028
I wonder.

560
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,528
What do you mean, "I wonder"?

561
00:26:54,528 --> 00:26:58,228
That's why we let you interrogate them, you know.

562
00:26:58,228 --> 00:26:59,828
Well, I did find out that...

563
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:02,328
You found out that?

564
00:27:02,328 --> 00:27:07,028
All of them ordered hot and spicy food. That's about it!

565
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:10,028
Hey.

566
00:27:11,828 --> 00:27:13,228
No good.

567
00:27:13,228 --> 00:27:16,728
Talking about food, I'm getting hungry.

568
00:27:16,728 --> 00:27:19,128
Come to think of it, we haven't eaten lunch yet.

569
00:27:19,128 --> 00:27:22,328
Then, would you like to eat too, Heiji?

570
00:27:22,328 --> 00:27:25,028
The food here in this family restaurant is really delicious!

571
00:27:25,028 --> 00:27:28,528
You mean we're racking our brains investigating this case,

572
00:27:28,528 --> 00:27:30,128
but you guys are eating happy-go-luckily!

573
00:27:30,128 --> 00:27:33,628
No, we were just starved.

574
00:27:33,628 --> 00:27:36,428
Besides, we're not just eating!

575
00:27:36,428 --> 00:27:38,328
Right, Dad?

576
00:27:40,328 --> 00:27:41,628
Yeah.

577
00:27:41,628 --> 00:27:44,828
We're eating the food that the three suspects ordered

578
00:27:44,828 --> 00:27:46,928
and investigating too!

579
00:27:46,928 --> 00:27:50,428
And, did you figure something out?

580
00:27:50,428 --> 00:27:53,028
Well, that the food is good, I guess.

581
00:27:53,028 --> 00:27:55,228
You're just merely eating.

582
00:27:55,228 --> 00:27:58,128
Are those dishes really what the three ordered?

583
00:27:58,128 --> 00:28:01,728
Yes! Uncle Kogoro was asking the waitress,

584
00:28:01,728 --> 00:28:03,428
so there's no mistake about it!

585
00:28:03,428 --> 00:28:06,028
This curry that I'm eating,

586
00:28:06,028 --> 00:28:09,128
the salt flavored ramen that Uncle Kogoro is eating

587
00:28:09,128 --> 00:28:10,728
and the Mabo Tofu that Ran is eating,

588
00:28:10,728 --> 00:28:12,228
are the three dishes they ordered!

589
00:28:12,228 --> 00:28:16,228
Are those three dishes really the right ones?

590
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:17,928
Yeah.

591
00:28:17,928 --> 00:28:20,128
Well, to put it more accurately,

592
00:28:20,128 --> 00:28:22,928
the two who ate curry and salted ramen,

593
00:28:22,928 --> 00:28:26,928
drank coffee and ate cake before the main dish.

594
00:28:26,928 --> 00:28:29,028
The guy who ordered Mabo Tofu

595
00:28:29,028 --> 00:28:32,828
also ordered fruit for dessert, but suddenly cancelled it,

596
00:28:32,828 --> 00:28:34,728
the waitress said.

597
00:28:34,728 --> 00:28:37,728
I see, so that's the story.

598
00:28:37,728 --> 00:28:39,328
If so...

599
00:28:39,328 --> 00:28:44,228
I understand why he talked and acted strange.

600
00:28:44,228 --> 00:28:47,228
No doubt about it! He's the culprit!

601
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:52,628
It seems he's found what he's after.

602
00:28:59,026 --> 00:29:00,226
Inspector!

603
00:29:00,226 --> 00:29:02,626
We just got word from Chiba

604
00:29:02,626 --> 00:29:04,526
that they found the victim's name.

605
00:29:04,526 --> 00:29:06,326
Oh, is that right?

606
00:29:06,326 --> 00:29:08,826
He was hired by and working part-time

607
00:29:08,826 --> 00:29:10,426
at a construction company in the Saitama Prefecture.

608
00:29:10,426 --> 00:29:12,826
His name is Mr. Kengo Shibamiya.

609
00:29:12,826 --> 00:29:15,926
Mr. Shibamiya seems to have been the person who first found

610
00:29:15,926 --> 00:29:18,326
the body of the president of a construction company in Saitama,

611
00:29:18,326 --> 00:29:20,926
who was poisoned to death in a case that occurred last week.

612
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,726
When Mr. Shibamiya returned from lunch

613
00:29:22,726 --> 00:29:24,826
that he had together with his part-time colleagues,

614
00:29:24,826 --> 00:29:27,026
he found the president who had been murdered.

615
00:29:27,026 --> 00:29:28,826
The item used to kill the victim

616
00:29:28,826 --> 00:29:29,826
was the same as what was used in this case,

617
00:29:29,826 --> 00:29:33,126
a candy drop laced with hydrogen cyanide.

618
00:29:33,126 --> 00:29:35,126
Taking into consideration that the room was not messed up at all,

619
00:29:35,126 --> 00:29:38,426
but that all the money in the safe was stolen,

620
00:29:38,426 --> 00:29:41,026
the Saitama Prefectural police are pursuing

621
00:29:41,026 --> 00:29:44,526
personnel of the company who would've known that

622
00:29:44,526 --> 00:29:47,426
the president liked candy drops,

623
00:29:47,426 --> 00:29:49,026
and that after lunch he would return to his room

624
00:29:49,026 --> 00:29:50,726
and count the money in the safe.

625
00:29:50,726 --> 00:29:52,426
I see.

626
00:29:52,426 --> 00:29:55,326
It's highly likely that the culprit

627
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:57,226
asked Mr. Shibamiya who was killed in this case,

628
00:29:57,226 --> 00:30:00,226
about the president's likes and action patterns,

629
00:30:00,226 --> 00:30:02,526
and used the knowledge to commit the crime.

630
00:30:02,526 --> 00:30:05,126
By the way, it seems that the president was scheduled to meet

631
00:30:05,126 --> 00:30:08,126
a man who was to be newly hired by the company that day.

632
00:30:08,126 --> 00:30:11,626
If Mr. Shibamiya and the culprit are childhood friends,

633
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:15,126
then Mr. Shibamiya must've introduced them to each other.

634
00:30:15,126 --> 00:30:20,126
And? Did that Mr. Shibamiya come from the Kansai area after all?

635
00:30:20,126 --> 00:30:22,826
Yes, it seems he told his colleagues

636
00:30:22,826 --> 00:30:25,426
he was born and raised in Osaka.

637
00:30:25,426 --> 00:30:27,826
It seems he lied about his age saying he was in his 40s,

638
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,626
and his name could also be an alias.

639
00:30:30,626 --> 00:30:32,726
In other words, the three suspects

640
00:30:32,726 --> 00:30:38,126
all fall in the same age bracket, huh?

641
00:30:38,126 --> 00:30:40,126
So, we already know that

642
00:30:40,126 --> 00:30:43,426
somebody from Kansai is among the three of you!

643
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:45,726
If you're from Kansai, why don't you come right out

644
00:30:45,726 --> 00:30:47,726
and identify yourself like a person from Kansai would!

645
00:30:47,726 --> 00:30:50,326
Heiji! You're being unreasonable!

646
00:30:50,326 --> 00:30:51,726
What're you all worked up about?

647
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:53,526
Why wouldn't I be all worked up?

648
00:30:53,526 --> 00:30:56,226
I'm in the lead for now, you know.

649
00:30:56,226 --> 00:30:59,026
In the lead?

650
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:00,926
I've got to solve the case fast

651
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:03,226
or he'll take the credit for this case again.

652
00:31:03,226 --> 00:31:04,226
What?

653
00:31:04,226 --> 00:31:07,326
You've figured out who the culprit is, Shinichi?

654
00:31:12,026 --> 00:31:13,226
Yes, I got it!

655
00:31:13,226 --> 00:31:16,726
I'll tell everybody that deduction!

656
00:31:16,726 --> 00:31:19,026
Is that call from the detective brat?

657
00:31:19,026 --> 00:31:20,626
Oh, yes.

658
00:31:20,626 --> 00:31:23,426
Hey, give me the phone, Conan!

659
00:31:23,426 --> 00:31:25,626
Oh, sorry. I hung up.

660
00:31:25,626 --> 00:31:27,126
Geez!

661
00:31:27,126 --> 00:31:29,926
And, what did Kudo tell you?

662
00:31:29,926 --> 00:31:31,526
Oh, yes.

663
00:31:31,526 --> 00:31:34,026
Although the three suspects all said that

664
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:36,926
they were born and raised in Tokyo,

665
00:31:36,926 --> 00:31:38,926
he told me that there is a person

666
00:31:38,926 --> 00:31:41,026
who is hiding that he is from Kansai,

667
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:44,126
and that this person is the culprit!

668
00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:50,026
Just as would be expected of Kudo!

669
00:31:50,026 --> 00:31:52,026
Hey! Hold it there!

670
00:31:52,026 --> 00:31:54,026
You're from Tokyo!

671
00:31:54,026 --> 00:31:56,626
What do you know about the people of Kansai?

672
00:31:56,626 --> 00:32:01,226
You know it wasn't me, it was Shinichi who said that.

673
00:32:01,226 --> 00:32:04,426
He said not the tables are turned and he hit a counter homerun.

674
00:32:04,426 --> 00:32:05,926
I tell you.

675
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:08,826
He doesn't know much about baseball and yet...

676
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,126
Oh, that's right!

677
00:32:10,126 --> 00:32:13,426
Shinichi told me to ask the person at this restaurant

678
00:32:13,426 --> 00:32:16,426
to make a certain thing!

679
00:32:16,426 --> 00:32:17,926
A certain thing?

680
00:32:17,926 --> 00:32:20,426
Something about you'd be able to tell

681
00:32:20,426 --> 00:32:22,626
if the person is from Kansai or not as soon as he drinks it.

682
00:32:22,626 --> 00:32:24,926
It seems to be a magic dish!

683
00:32:24,926 --> 00:32:26,726
A magic...

684
00:32:26,726 --> 00:32:28,126
dish?

685
00:32:32,426 --> 00:32:36,126
This is miso soup, isn't it?

686
00:32:36,126 --> 00:32:38,126
You seriously want us to drink it?

687
00:32:38,126 --> 00:32:41,626
Well, if you say you can figure out the culprit

688
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,626
if we drink this, I'll do so.

689
00:32:43,626 --> 00:32:47,026
Drink it in one gulp as much as you can!

690
00:32:52,026 --> 00:32:53,926
Oh, and I had a bowl made for everybody else

691
00:32:53,926 --> 00:32:55,726
while I was at it,

692
00:32:55,726 --> 00:32:57,826
so why don't you drink some too, Heiji?

693
00:32:57,826 --> 00:33:00,326
What is he up to?

694
00:33:00,326 --> 00:33:01,926
How does he expect to figure out who the culprit is

695
00:33:01,926 --> 00:33:03,826
doing something like this?

696
00:33:09,226 --> 00:33:10,326
"Karai"! (Salty)

697
00:33:10,326 --> 00:33:11,926
What's with this miso soup?

698
00:33:11,926 --> 00:33:13,326
You can say that again!

699
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:14,626
I always thought that the food in Tokyo

700
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:17,026
had strong tasting miso in them but...

701
00:33:17,026 --> 00:33:19,226
It's just as they say,

702
00:33:19,226 --> 00:33:22,726
I can't drink anymore of this "karai" (salty) stuff.

703
00:33:25,926 --> 00:33:26,926
What?

704
00:33:26,926 --> 00:33:28,826
Isn't it "karai" (salty) for you guys?

705
00:33:28,826 --> 00:33:30,026
No.

706
00:33:30,026 --> 00:33:33,126
It's true that it's a bit salty

707
00:33:33,126 --> 00:33:35,526
but more than "karai"...

708
00:33:35,526 --> 00:33:38,126
It's "shoppai" (salty), right?

709
00:33:38,126 --> 00:33:39,826
"Shoppai"?

710
00:33:39,826 --> 00:33:41,126
The people of Tokyo

711
00:33:41,126 --> 00:33:44,826
refer to spicy food such as curry and Mabo Tofu

712
00:33:44,826 --> 00:33:46,626
as "karai" (spicy hot)

713
00:33:46,626 --> 00:33:48,326
but when it comes to salty food,

714
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:50,426
they say, "shoppai"! (Salty)

715
00:33:50,426 --> 00:33:53,126
So, Mr. Amakasu who referred to the miso soup

716
00:33:53,126 --> 00:33:55,526
and salt tasting ramen as "karai"

717
00:33:55,526 --> 00:33:57,626
is from Kansai!

718
00:33:58,626 --> 00:34:00,926
What? Are you serious?

719
00:34:00,926 --> 00:34:04,026
Then, you don't say that sea water is "karai"?

720
00:34:04,026 --> 00:34:06,326
We either say it's "shiokkarai" or "shoppai".

721
00:34:06,326 --> 00:34:09,926
That's just a simple error in choice of words!

722
00:34:09,926 --> 00:34:12,826
I really wanted to say "shiokkarai"

723
00:34:12,826 --> 00:34:16,126
but just happen to say what that boy from Osaka said.

724
00:34:16,126 --> 00:34:19,626
Oh, and the sound you used at the end of your sentence.

725
00:34:19,626 --> 00:34:21,226
It's ordinary Tokyo dialect

726
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,126
like you just used a while ago too, brat!

727
00:34:23,126 --> 00:34:26,426
People from Tokyo don't use the phrase "Tokyo dialect"!

728
00:34:26,426 --> 00:34:29,926
People from Kansai are the only ones who say that, right?

729
00:34:29,926 --> 00:34:31,726
You don't say that, do you?

730
00:34:33,626 --> 00:34:35,326
No.

731
00:34:35,326 --> 00:34:36,726
Well, I found out for the first time

732
00:34:36,726 --> 00:34:39,826
that putting "sa" at the end of a sentence is used in Tokyo, but...

733
00:34:39,826 --> 00:34:41,526
I thought so too.

734
00:34:41,526 --> 00:34:44,226
That it was just ordinary colloquial Japanese.

735
00:34:44,226 --> 00:34:47,826
Well, it seems that most people from the Kanto area

736
00:34:47,826 --> 00:34:50,026
say "sa" at the end of a sentence.

737
00:34:50,026 --> 00:34:52,826
If you insist that I talk funny,

738
00:34:52,826 --> 00:34:55,326
that man was talking funny too?

739
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:58,826
He said that he was going to eat the sweets for dessert!

740
00:34:58,826 --> 00:35:02,426
But you ordered assorted fruit, didn't you?

741
00:35:02,426 --> 00:35:04,326
That's not sweets!

742
00:35:04,326 --> 00:35:07,926
I was referring to fruit.

743
00:35:07,926 --> 00:35:09,226
Huh?

744
00:35:09,226 --> 00:35:10,526
Oh, don't you say that?

745
00:35:10,526 --> 00:35:12,726
Aren't fruit called sweets?

746
00:35:12,726 --> 00:35:16,226
I don't use it, but I know what you mean.

747
00:35:16,226 --> 00:35:18,626
At the end of the menu of high class Japanese style restaurants,

748
00:35:18,626 --> 00:35:21,326
the word "sweets" is written.

749
00:35:21,326 --> 00:35:23,426
Is that also Tokyo dialect?

750
00:35:23,426 --> 00:35:25,426
A word from the Edo era!

751
00:35:25,426 --> 00:35:28,226
The only ones who use it even now are the Edoites.

752
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,926
You said that sweets will make you fat,

753
00:35:30,926 --> 00:35:32,926
Heiji because you thought it was candy,

754
00:35:32,926 --> 00:35:35,226
so you don't use this word in Osaka, right?

755
00:35:35,226 --> 00:35:37,026
That's why...

756
00:35:37,026 --> 00:35:40,026
no matter how you look at Mr. Amakasu,

757
00:35:40,026 --> 00:35:44,626
you can tell that he's from Kansai!

758
00:35:44,626 --> 00:35:46,126
Hey, Kudo.

759
00:35:46,126 --> 00:35:49,226
Besides, you seem to have been holding your cigarette

760
00:35:49,226 --> 00:35:50,926
with you left hand, mister,

761
00:35:50,926 --> 00:35:53,726
But, aren't you actually right-handed?

762
00:35:53,726 --> 00:35:54,926
Because you put the chopsticks

763
00:35:54,926 --> 00:35:58,326
you used for the ramen on your right!

764
00:35:58,326 --> 00:36:00,426
-Hey, cut out that way of talking! -It's easy to explain

765
00:36:00,426 --> 00:36:04,226
the reason for why you did all these things deliberately!

766
00:36:04,226 --> 00:36:05,726
You were afraid

767
00:36:05,726 --> 00:36:07,526
to hold the cigarette with the right hand

768
00:36:07,526 --> 00:36:09,426
that you grabbed the poisoned candy drop with, right?

769
00:36:09,426 --> 00:36:13,126
-Hey, it's about time... -That's enough, you!

770
00:36:13,126 --> 00:36:15,426
Using that strange Kansai dialect of yours.

771
00:36:15,426 --> 00:36:17,026
What's with you, idiot?

772
00:36:17,026 --> 00:36:19,826
-Kan... -Kansai dialect!

773
00:36:23,526 --> 00:36:25,626
Oh, well...

774
00:36:25,626 --> 00:36:28,026
I just sort of copied the fighting style words

775
00:36:28,026 --> 00:36:30,026
that I hear a lot on TV.

776
00:36:30,026 --> 00:36:31,426
I got kind of annoyed

777
00:36:31,426 --> 00:36:34,226
because this brat started talking funny all of a sudden.

778
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:35,826
That's right.

779
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:37,626
It's characteristic of the people of Kansai

780
00:36:37,626 --> 00:36:38,826
to get annoyed

781
00:36:38,826 --> 00:36:41,026
when hearing Kansai dialect spoken incorrectly!

782
00:36:41,026 --> 00:36:43,626
Because there are rarely any Japanese people

783
00:36:43,626 --> 00:36:46,326
who get angry at hearing people from abroad

784
00:36:46,326 --> 00:36:48,326
speak funny Japanese, right?

785
00:36:48,326 --> 00:36:51,726
And, you ordered ramen after committing the crime

786
00:36:51,726 --> 00:36:54,426
because you wanted a wet wipe, right?

787
00:36:54,426 --> 00:36:56,126
You knew they'd give you one right away

788
00:36:56,126 --> 00:36:58,026
if you told them that you spilled some soup.

789
00:36:58,026 --> 00:37:00,426
You wanted a wet wipe to wipe the poison off your hand

790
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,426
that you were planning to wash

791
00:37:02,426 --> 00:37:05,326
after poisoning Mr. Shibamiya to death!

792
00:37:05,326 --> 00:37:07,526
You didn't wash your hands in the restroom

793
00:37:07,526 --> 00:37:09,326
because you heard running water

794
00:37:09,326 --> 00:37:12,426
and noticed that someone was inside.

795
00:37:12,426 --> 00:37:13,926
You flushed the toilet, didn't you?

796
00:37:13,926 --> 00:37:15,826
Yeah.

797
00:37:15,826 --> 00:37:17,826
I heard a man groan so I did so,

798
00:37:17,826 --> 00:37:21,226
before I left the toilet to check things out.

799
00:37:21,226 --> 00:37:22,726
I see.

800
00:37:22,726 --> 00:37:25,126
So, the footsteps of the culprit walking away

801
00:37:25,126 --> 00:37:27,126
was erased by the toilet being flushed.

802
00:37:27,126 --> 00:37:29,826
But, why then did he hold the cigarette in his left hand

803
00:37:29,826 --> 00:37:31,926
despite having wiped his hands with the wet wipe?

804
00:37:31,926 --> 00:37:33,526
Maybe because he wasn't sure

805
00:37:33,526 --> 00:37:35,826
if all the poison was wiped off nicely?

806
00:37:35,826 --> 00:37:38,126
Poison is invisible besides.

807
00:37:38,126 --> 00:37:41,126
Since the wet wipe isn't on the table,

808
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:43,526
you put it inside the pocket of your clothes, right?

809
00:37:43,526 --> 00:37:46,426
I think if the police check that wet wipe,

810
00:37:46,426 --> 00:37:48,526
they'll be able to figure things out.

811
00:37:48,526 --> 00:37:51,526
They'll see that you're the one

812
00:37:51,526 --> 00:37:53,226
who used the poisoned candy drop

813
00:37:53,226 --> 00:37:55,326
and killed Mr. Shibamiya!

814
00:37:55,326 --> 00:37:59,826
That's what Shinichi told me on the phone!

815
00:38:05,426 --> 00:38:06,626
Hey!

816
00:38:06,626 --> 00:38:07,826
Out of the way!

817
00:38:07,826 --> 00:38:10,226
Oh, I don't think you should.

818
00:38:16,326 --> 00:38:17,426
Shoots!

819
00:38:17,426 --> 00:38:19,226
I don't think you should take her on either.

820
00:38:29,026 --> 00:38:31,326
That girl in pony tail's pretty good.

821
00:38:31,326 --> 00:38:33,426
I warned you...

822
00:38:33,426 --> 00:38:35,726
That you shouldn't.

823
00:38:44,026 --> 00:38:45,826
Case closed.

824
00:38:51,626 --> 00:38:54,426
Oh, you're back earlier than expected, Camel.

825
00:38:54,426 --> 00:38:56,226
Was the case solved?

826
00:38:56,226 --> 00:38:57,426
Yes.

827
00:38:57,426 --> 00:38:59,026
It seems that a man

828
00:38:59,026 --> 00:39:02,426
poisoned a president of some company for want of money,

829
00:39:02,426 --> 00:39:05,526
and since his friend was about to disclose the crime,

830
00:39:05,526 --> 00:39:08,526
he called him out to the restroom to shut him up.

831
00:39:08,526 --> 00:39:11,426
That seems to have been the truth of the case.

832
00:39:11,426 --> 00:39:14,226
And? This person that you sent a photo taken by cell phone.

833
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:15,326
What about this teenager?

834
00:39:15,326 --> 00:39:17,526
Seems to be a high school student

835
00:39:17,526 --> 00:39:19,826
who came to the scene of the crime with Conan and the others.

836
00:39:19,826 --> 00:39:22,826
Any recognition, Jodie?

837
00:39:22,826 --> 00:39:26,426
I feel as if we've met somewhere before.

838
00:39:26,426 --> 00:39:28,026
I wonder.

839
00:39:28,026 --> 00:39:30,926
Is this kid look familiar to you, James?

840
00:39:30,926 --> 00:39:32,226
No.

841
00:39:32,226 --> 00:39:35,926
I don't remember anybody like her.

842
00:39:35,926 --> 00:39:37,126
Her?

843
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:41,726
Yes, I thought she was a boy, but she's a girl.

844
00:39:41,726 --> 00:39:44,726
Huh? But, it's amazing that

845
00:39:44,726 --> 00:39:46,326
you could tell that she's a girl.

846
00:39:46,326 --> 00:39:49,426
Well, I guess you could call it wisdom that comes with age?

847
00:39:49,426 --> 00:39:51,326
I've polished my sense of things like these

848
00:39:51,326 --> 00:39:53,726
through the years, you see.

849
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,226
This girl.

850
00:39:57,226 --> 00:39:59,026
She resembles somebody?

851
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:02,526
What?

852
00:40:02,526 --> 00:40:05,326
Why is it a tie?

853
00:40:05,326 --> 00:40:07,326
The one who saw through who the culprit was

854
00:40:07,326 --> 00:40:09,426
and solved the case is Shinichi, right?

855
00:40:09,426 --> 00:40:10,826
Were they competing with each other,

856
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:12,326
Heiji and Kudo?

857
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,926
I guess so.

858
00:40:13,926 --> 00:40:17,726
Well, it was Heiji who hit it off with the case,

859
00:40:17,726 --> 00:40:19,926
because he is from Kansai.

860
00:40:19,926 --> 00:40:22,926
And Shinichi, the boy from Tokyo,

861
00:40:22,926 --> 00:40:26,326
used that as a foundation to get to the truth of the case.

862
00:40:26,326 --> 00:40:29,026
Therefore, I think a tie is fair enough.

863
00:40:30,126 --> 00:40:34,126
But I wonder if what Conan said a while ago is true?

864
00:40:34,126 --> 00:40:36,326
About Kansai people getting angry over people

865
00:40:36,326 --> 00:40:39,226
who copy their way to talking.

866
00:40:39,226 --> 00:40:41,026
You'd get angry too, wouldn't you, Ran,

867
00:40:41,026 --> 00:40:46,026
if I said thing like "Ano-sa" or "Ran sa"?

868
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,326
I wouldn't get mad.

869
00:40:48,326 --> 00:40:50,526
On the contrary, I think I'd be happy.

870
00:40:52,326 --> 00:40:54,326
In other words, it only goes to show that

871
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:57,026
people from Kansai are narrow-minded, after all.

872
00:40:57,026 --> 00:40:59,826
That's not true!

873
00:40:59,826 --> 00:41:01,626
Maybe it only goes to show that

874
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:05,326
the people from Kansai cherish the language that they use?

875
00:41:05,326 --> 00:41:07,226
Yes!

876
00:41:07,226 --> 00:41:10,326
Yes, that's right!

877
00:41:10,326 --> 00:41:13,126
Oh, Ran, you used the Kansai dialect!

878
00:41:14,226 --> 00:41:19,426
But that detective boy wasn't even at the crime site, so...

879
00:41:19,426 --> 00:41:22,526
I guess he beat the other one?

880
00:41:22,526 --> 00:41:25,326
Right!

881
00:41:25,326 --> 00:41:26,526
Hey.

882
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:31,626
I'm gonna give away that you're Kudo, you know.

883
00:41:31,626 --> 00:41:32,726
Besides!

884
00:41:32,726 --> 00:41:34,226
I'm telling you that you who made that guy

885
00:41:34,226 --> 00:41:37,826
use funny Kansai dialect is minus point, you idiot!

886
00:41:37,826 --> 00:41:42,126
Well, I don't think overdoing it is good though.

887
00:41:42,126 --> 00:41:43,326
And?

888
00:41:43,326 --> 00:41:46,526
What'd you come to Tokyo for?

889
00:43:11,426 --> 00:43:14,926
Huh? You got a letter from a dead person?

890
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,626
For Hattori?

891
00:43:16,626 --> 00:43:20,326
Yeah. That person, is my mother's acquaintance.

892
00:43:20,326 --> 00:43:21,826
A person named Wakamatsu

893
00:43:21,826 --> 00:43:25,026
who is the president of a design company in Tokyo.

894
00:43:25,026 --> 00:43:27,526
I've met him several times before too,

895
00:43:27,526 --> 00:43:32,326
but it seems he was killed at a villa in Karuizawa.

896
00:43:32,326 --> 00:43:34,026
Killed?

897
00:43:34,026 --> 00:43:35,026
Yeah.

898
00:43:35,026 --> 00:43:36,726
I had Officer Otake of the Osaka Prefectural Police

899
00:43:36,726 --> 00:43:38,626
check on it for me.

900
00:43:38,626 --> 00:43:39,826
But, it just so happened that

901
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:41,426
they were having a birthday party

902
00:43:41,426 --> 00:43:44,626
for Mr. Wakamatsu's wife that day at the villa.

903
00:43:44,626 --> 00:43:47,126
The local police seems to think that a robber

904
00:43:47,126 --> 00:43:50,026
who broke into the villa encountered Mr. Wakamatsu,

905
00:43:50,026 --> 00:43:53,126
and as a result ended up killing him.

906
00:43:53,126 --> 00:43:56,726
But, why would he send you a letter, Heiji?

907
00:43:56,726 --> 00:44:00,026
Don't tell me that he sent it out before he was killed?

908
00:44:00,026 --> 00:44:01,026
No.

909
00:44:01,026 --> 00:44:04,926
That letter is post marked ten days after the crime,

910
00:44:04,926 --> 00:44:07,126
so I don't think he's the one who sent it out.

911
00:44:07,126 --> 00:44:10,326
The name of the sender is Kohei Wakamatsu but...

912
00:44:10,326 --> 00:44:12,626
the contents of the letter seems to have been written

913
00:44:12,626 --> 00:44:14,226
by the culprit who killed him.

914
00:44:14,226 --> 00:44:15,526
The culprit?

915
00:44:15,526 --> 00:44:19,326
Yeah. This is what is written in the letter.

916
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:22,026
"Dear Heiji Hattori,"

917
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:25,726
"I would like to see you, Mr. High School Detective"

918
00:44:25,726 --> 00:44:29,326
"and confess the crime that I have committed."

919
00:44:29,326 --> 00:44:30,726
"But, even if I were to meet you,"

920
00:44:30,726 --> 00:44:33,226
"I feel slightly doubtful whether you'd be able to"

921
00:44:33,226 --> 00:44:35,226
"visibly see me or not."

922
00:44:35,226 --> 00:44:37,826
"Why? Because I am a warped entity"

923
00:44:37,826 --> 00:44:41,026
"that you people have made up on your own."

924
00:44:41,026 --> 00:44:42,826
"I'm an illusionary figure that one cannot visibly see"

925
00:44:42,826 --> 00:44:44,726
"under normal circumstances."

926
00:44:44,726 --> 00:44:46,526
"Despite this, if you'd still like to see me,"

927
00:44:46,526 --> 00:44:48,726
"I'll be waiting for you at the residence of the man"

928
00:44:48,726 --> 00:44:52,726
"that I have killed during the night of the next full moon."

929
00:44:52,926 --> 00:44:55,326
And, at the end of the letter,

930
00:44:55,326 --> 00:44:59,626
Mr. Wakamatsu's address in Osaka is written.

931
00:44:59,626 --> 00:45:01,626
And along with...

932
00:45:03,526 --> 00:45:06,726
the key of the house was inside too!

933
00:45:08,526 --> 00:45:13,226
That was the key to unlock the door to a new case.

934
00:45:13,226 --> 00:45:17,226
To open the door to a horrendous serial killing case.

935
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:22,620
Next Conan's Hint:

936
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,623
Eight Parts

937
00:45:24,623 --> 00:45:26,623
-I win the battle. -So, you think...

938
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:28,023
I'm going to win it after all.

939
00:45:28,023 --> 00:45:29,723
Hey...
