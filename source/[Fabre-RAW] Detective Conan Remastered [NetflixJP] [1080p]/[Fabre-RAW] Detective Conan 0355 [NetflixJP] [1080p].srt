1
00:00:03,622 --> 00:00:05,322
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:05,322 --> 00:00:07,422
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:07,422 --> 00:00:09,222
The three kimono beauties are the suspects.

4
00:00:09,222 --> 00:00:11,022
Solve the mystery of the mole on the chest.

5
00:00:11,022 --> 00:00:12,622
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,622 --> 00:00:14,322
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,322 --> 00:00:16,322
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:01,183
"The Little Client (Part 2)"

9
00:02:04,383 --> 00:02:06,383
No murder weapon?

10
00:02:06,383 --> 00:02:08,383
Well...

11
00:02:08,383 --> 00:02:09,883
"Tomoka Saegusa (28)" -I can't believe it.

12
00:02:09,883 --> 00:02:11,983
You haven't even found the murder weapon.

13
00:02:11,983 --> 00:02:14,083
We're going back to work then.

14
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,383
Wait!

15
00:02:15,383 --> 00:02:18,083
I'd like to question you all later,

16
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,683
so please wait in another room till then.

17
00:02:19,683 --> 00:02:22,583
If you insist that we wait, I guess we will.

18
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:23,783
"Toshika Bessho (29)" -But I won't answer

19
00:02:23,783 --> 00:02:25,483
no matter what you ask me.

20
00:02:25,483 --> 00:02:29,083
"Mitsu Kusano (34)" -There's nothing suspicious about us.

21
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,483
We were just taking an outdoor bath,

22
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,083
so we're not going to let you treat us like criminals.

23
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,183
An outdoor bath?

24
00:02:34,183 --> 00:02:37,583
Yes, it seems that they all took a bath at about 11:55 pm,

25
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,083
which is around the time of the crime.

26
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,283
Then, about 20 minutes later,

27
00:02:41,283 --> 00:02:43,183
Mr. Mouri went in as well.

28
00:02:43,183 --> 00:02:45,483
What? He went in?

29
00:02:45,483 --> 00:02:48,283
Don't tell me you peeked into the women's bath?

30
00:02:48,283 --> 00:02:49,883
It's for both men and women.

31
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:52,183
I see. Just because it's for both women and men,

32
00:02:52,183 --> 00:02:53,383
it doesn't mean that you can go ahead and look in, you know!

33
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:55,083
I'm telling you! So listen!

34
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,283
I just thought that if somebody was already inside,

35
00:02:57,283 --> 00:02:59,383
-I'd be lucky... -Huh?

36
00:02:59,383 --> 00:03:01,983
Isn't this movie the one that Kazuki acted in?

37
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,783
Why is something like that found over here?

38
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:07,283
It's the video that Mr. Kamoshita rented.

39
00:03:07,283 --> 00:03:10,683
They rent out movie videos here at the inn.

40
00:03:10,683 --> 00:03:11,683
Give it to me.

41
00:03:13,683 --> 00:03:15,383
Let's take a look at it.

42
00:03:16,683 --> 00:03:19,683
Mr. Mouri, we don't have time to watch that.

43
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:23,783
Some clues could be hidden in it, right?

44
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,683
It looks like a scary movie.

45
00:03:33,683 --> 00:03:35,283
It's only kid's stuff.

46
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,383
Don't worry.

47
00:03:39,383 --> 00:03:42,383
Your mother's not the killer.

48
00:03:42,383 --> 00:03:45,683
I'm not worried about that lady at all.

49
00:03:51,683 --> 00:03:53,183
Kazuki?

50
00:03:53,183 --> 00:03:54,883
The sound reminds me of my mother.

51
00:03:54,883 --> 00:03:56,183
Huh?

52
00:03:56,183 --> 00:03:57,183
Wait!

53
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,183
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:06,183 --> 00:04:09,583
A guest suddenly said he wants dinner.

55
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,883
Was it noisy?

56
00:04:11,883 --> 00:04:13,083
No.

57
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:16,683
So you want to see your mother after all, don't you, Kazuki?

58
00:04:16,683 --> 00:04:18,083
Not really.

59
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,183
I just thought that it'd be a hint to finding her.

60
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,583
Hey, stupid! Look behind you, behind!

61
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,183
Behind you, I said!

62
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,983
Wait. Something's coming from the ceiling!

63
00:04:34,383 --> 00:04:36,383
Talk about getting carried away.

64
00:04:36,383 --> 00:04:41,083
"The end"

65
00:04:46,683 --> 00:04:49,483
It was quite amusing, wasn't it?

66
00:04:49,483 --> 00:04:51,483
Yes.

67
00:04:51,483 --> 00:04:53,983
But we really got nothing out of it, didn't we?

68
00:04:53,983 --> 00:04:55,383
I guess not.

69
00:04:55,383 --> 00:04:57,683
I see. I get it now.

70
00:04:59,783 --> 00:05:02,283
That's why the killer soaked his body

71
00:05:02,283 --> 00:05:05,583
into the bath tub after strangling the victim.

72
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,683
There are only two mysteries left to solve.

73
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,883
The reason why the killer took a bath

74
00:05:09,883 --> 00:05:11,683
and that mole.

75
00:05:11,683 --> 00:05:15,483
The killer could've gotten naked to set the victim off guard,

76
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:17,183
but what about the mole?

77
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:20,283
Officer Yokomizo, may I have a moment with you?

78
00:05:20,283 --> 00:05:21,483
Yes, what is it?

79
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:25,283
We were concerned about the trace on the neck

80
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,883
that we didn't notice at first.

81
00:05:26,883 --> 00:05:28,383
But there were marks of the victim

82
00:05:28,383 --> 00:05:31,283
being hit several times on the back of his head.

83
00:05:32,283 --> 00:05:33,883
Then, was he struck to death?

84
00:05:33,883 --> 00:05:36,383
No. He seemed to have bled,

85
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,983
but it wasn't what killed him.

86
00:05:37,983 --> 00:05:40,483
It's most likely that the killer hit him, and after he passed out,

87
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:42,683
she strangled him to death.

88
00:05:42,683 --> 00:05:44,783
If so, this shower nozzle is very likely

89
00:05:44,783 --> 00:05:47,183
the weapon that was used to hit him.

90
00:05:47,183 --> 00:05:50,183
Please do a luminol reaction test right away.

91
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,283
I see. So that's the story.

92
00:05:53,283 --> 00:05:54,883
That means the most suspicious person

93
00:05:54,883 --> 00:05:57,083
would be the one who tried to hide it.

94
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,883
Okay, I'll put Pops to sleep using the tranquilizer gun.

95
00:05:59,883 --> 00:06:01,683
-Hey, Conan. -Huh?

96
00:06:01,683 --> 00:06:02,983
What do you mean, "Huh"?

97
00:06:02,983 --> 00:06:04,383
It's past three o'clock already,

98
00:06:04,383 --> 00:06:06,183
so you'd better get to bed!

99
00:06:06,183 --> 00:06:07,283
But...

100
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,883
We've got to go look for Kazuki's mother

101
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:11,783
who's a good cook tomorrow, you know.

102
00:06:11,783 --> 00:06:13,183
Good cook?

103
00:06:13,183 --> 00:06:14,183
Remember?

104
00:06:14,183 --> 00:06:16,583
He mentioned that he used to go to sleep a lot

105
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,383
while looking at his mother's mole.

106
00:06:18,383 --> 00:06:19,883
It seems that he used to hear

107
00:06:19,883 --> 00:06:22,983
the rhythmical sound of the knife cutting things.

108
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,483
It means that she's a good cook, right?

109
00:06:25,483 --> 00:06:27,283
I... I guess so.

110
00:06:27,283 --> 00:06:29,883
I'll be right over, so please lay the mattress out for me, okay?

111
00:06:29,883 --> 00:06:31,283
Promise, okay?

112
00:06:31,283 --> 00:06:34,683
And if Kazuki gets up, please tell him something.

113
00:06:35,783 --> 00:06:39,583
His mother is not the killer.

114
00:06:40,283 --> 00:06:42,483
Inspector Yokomizo, luminol reaction was detected

115
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:44,383
from the shower nozzle.

116
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:46,783
The killer must've hit Mr. Kamoshita on the head

117
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,283
with this shower nozzle,

118
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,983
knocked him out and then strangled him to death.

119
00:06:50,983 --> 00:06:55,883
And did you find that thin, long, black string

120
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,183
that was used to choke him?

121
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,583
Well, we looked all over

122
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,083
where the three suspects could've hidden the string,

123
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,083
but no luck so far.

124
00:07:04,783 --> 00:07:07,383
This means that somebody out of those three

125
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:10,083
must still have it on her.

126
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:13,083
Okay, tell the policewoman

127
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,283
-to do a body check on them. -I think...

128
00:07:15,283 --> 00:07:16,983
that would be useless.

129
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:19,083
-But... -You saw it, didn't you?

130
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,683
The picture that was taken on the cell phone

131
00:07:21,683 --> 00:07:23,783
the moment Mr. Kamoshita was being strangled to death!

132
00:07:23,783 --> 00:07:26,283
There was a mole on the left side

133
00:07:26,283 --> 00:07:28,683
of the chest of the woman, wasn't there?

134
00:07:28,683 --> 00:07:31,783
But Ms. Kusano's mole on her chest was on the right side.

135
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:33,983
Ms. Bessho's was on her left cheek.

136
00:07:33,983 --> 00:07:36,383
And, Ms. Saegusa's was on the back of her neck.

137
00:07:36,383 --> 00:07:38,683
They are obviously not the killers.

138
00:07:38,683 --> 00:07:40,083
If you try to do a body check on them,

139
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,783
you're just going to get them angrier, don't you think?

140
00:07:42,783 --> 00:07:46,083
But the only ones who don't have an alibi

141
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,183
among the employees of this inn are those three.

142
00:07:49,283 --> 00:07:51,883
Well, let's call it a day for now.

143
00:07:51,883 --> 00:07:54,583
And I'd advise you to do a re-check on everyone in this inn,

144
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,883
including the guests.

145
00:07:56,883 --> 00:07:59,483
-Okay. -It did poke him for sure.

146
00:07:59,483 --> 00:08:00,983
What is going on?

147
00:08:00,983 --> 00:08:04,983
It seems that there's an off-season mosquito here too.

148
00:08:04,983 --> 00:08:06,483
A mosquito?

149
00:08:06,483 --> 00:08:09,283
See. I got a bite on my neck just a while ago...

150
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,083
What?

151
00:08:14,383 --> 00:08:16,583
Jalapeno, harami...

152
00:08:18,783 --> 00:08:21,483
Here he comes! The Sleeping Kogoro!

153
00:08:21,483 --> 00:08:24,983
It turns out the needle just didn't poke him deep enough.

154
00:08:24,983 --> 00:08:26,783
All right then, Officer Yokomizo.

155
00:08:26,783 --> 00:08:29,083
Please gather the things that I ask for

156
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:32,583
and bring the three suspects here.

157
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:33,883
Mr. Mouri.

158
00:08:33,883 --> 00:08:35,783
You've figured it out after all!

159
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:38,383
Yes. Let me explain the truth

160
00:08:38,383 --> 00:08:40,383
of what went on in this room

161
00:08:40,383 --> 00:08:43,383
regarding the strangulation of Mr. Kamoshita.

162
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:45,783
What you're saying doesn't fit in

163
00:08:45,783 --> 00:08:48,183
with what you've been saying just a while ago.

164
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,783
All right, Mr. Mouri!

165
00:08:54,383 --> 00:08:57,383
Everything's set.

166
00:08:57,383 --> 00:09:00,483
Sleeping Kogoro's deduction show is about to begin!

167
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:08,667
Hey, wait a second.

168
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:11,767
Why do we have to be called in again?

169
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:13,567
You saw for yourself already, didn't you?

170
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:16,667
We don't have the same mole that the killer had!

171
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:19,967
Besides, has the murder weapon been found?

172
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:23,067
You can't prove the murder without it, can you?

173
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:26,067
Of course we found it.

174
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:27,667
Right, Mr. Mouri?

175
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,867
No, we haven't found it.

176
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:30,867
What?

177
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:34,967
It has most likely been destroyed.

178
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:37,267
Destroyed? Mr. Mouri...

179
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:39,667
But we know what the killer used

180
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:42,767
to strangle Mr. Kamoshita

181
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:45,267
because we have this screwdriver.

182
00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:49,367
Oh, it seems as if your hands have become a bit smaller.

183
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:52,867
Never mind the details.

184
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:54,967
Inspector! I've rented it.

185
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:02,367
Shall we compare the two, then?

186
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,767
The video of the same movie that Mr. Kamoshita rented from this inn

187
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:09,567
and the video that we rented from the rental video shop.

188
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:13,767
First, we'll look at Mr. Kamoshita's video

189
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:15,567
that was here in this room.

190
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:24,567
Just as we've seen before,

191
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:26,967
it has a scary opening scene.

192
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:30,267
Next, let's look at the video from the rental video shop.

193
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:31,967
What? Is that all?

194
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:33,167
Yes.

195
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:51,367
The spot display of the video company...

196
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:53,867
and the spot display of the movie company.

197
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:55,867
What? Hey.

198
00:10:57,167 --> 00:10:58,667
Besides that, this is...

199
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:01,767
-the prologue of the movie. -So, let me explain the story

200
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:03,067
of the cursed stairs...

201
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:05,267
Strange. The opening title

202
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:07,767
appeared immediately in the other video we just saw.

203
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,367
It's been cut off

204
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:12,167
and shortened by about one minute.

205
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:19,567
And the killer used it to murder her victim.

206
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:21,667
I see! It's the video tape!

207
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:23,767
The killer victim opened the video tape using a screwdriver

208
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,467
and removed the tape from inside,

209
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:28,167
then cut off enough tape to use as the murder weapon.

210
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:31,767
She then reconnected the tape together with scotch tape.

211
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:32,867
If she adjusted the tape

212
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:36,067
so that the opening title appears when the tape is played,

213
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:38,667
she wouldn't be suspected

214
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:41,567
even if the police were to check the tape later.

215
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,267
But the black string that was taken on the cell phone

216
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:46,467
looked much thinner.

217
00:11:46,467 --> 00:11:48,467
That's easy.

218
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:50,467
Hey, disassemble the brand new tape

219
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:53,067
that Mr. Mouri told you to go buy.

220
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:54,067
Yes, sir.

221
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:08,267
Now, please look!

222
00:12:08,267 --> 00:12:10,567
If you don't do anything, it's nothing but a plain black strip.

223
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:13,367
But if you twist it like this...

224
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:15,967
Why...

225
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:18,467
It doesn't look like a thinner string.

226
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:20,767
It sure doesn't.

227
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:24,167
Instead of twisting it, you stretch it out.

228
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:26,867
Stretch it out?

229
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:28,267
How can you stretch it out even more...

230
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:34,567
Yes. When you pull the tape really hard,

231
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:37,167
it becomes thinner.

232
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:40,867
While I'm at it, the length of a tape being played at normal mode

233
00:12:40,867 --> 00:12:42,767
is about 30 centimeters per 10 seconds.

234
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:44,867
That is 180 centimeters per minute.

235
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:48,167
So if you stretch it out, it can easily go over 2 meters.

236
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,367
It's long enough for the killer

237
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:53,567
to wind around both hands, then strangle the victim to death.

238
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:58,067
So that's why the tape was a minute short.

239
00:13:00,267 --> 00:13:01,667
He looked at the recording time

240
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:04,467
that is posted on the box of the video!

241
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:06,267
Where did you come from, Conan?

242
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:08,967
See, it says the duration is 94 minutes.

243
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:11,467
but the counter of the video tape that we just saw

244
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:14,367
was 1 hour and 33 minutes.

245
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,367
Right, Pops?

246
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:20,267
But where's the video tape that was used to kill the victim?

247
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:22,967
She probably burned it with a lighter or something

248
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:26,467
and shoved the ashes down the drain of the bath tub.

249
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:29,767
After all, video tapes are made from very easily burnable substance.

250
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:33,867
Well, there's no doubt that the murder weapon is the tape.

251
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:35,767
If you check the video tape,

252
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:38,367
the part of the tape that was connected will probably be found.

253
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:40,767
Therefore, the killer tried to deceive the police

254
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:44,267
by soaking the body in a tub of water.

255
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:46,867
Didn't the killer do that to complicate

256
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,667
the estimation of the time of death?

257
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,567
Then please take a look

258
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:53,867
at your left hand that is holding the video tape.

259
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,767
What is this black trace?

260
00:13:56,767 --> 00:13:58,967
This is the black magnetic substance

261
00:13:58,967 --> 00:14:02,367
that is on the surface of the video tape in order to record images.

262
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:06,267
The killer tried to wash the black traces

263
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:10,167
off Mr. Kamoshita's neck, but his yukata got wet,

264
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:14,267
so she dunked his body into the water.

265
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:21,667
But the killer couldn't wash off what she had to the most.

266
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:23,467
The thing that would serve as conclusive evidence,

267
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:25,167
her red mole.

268
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:26,567
Red, you said?

269
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:28,967
Are you saying that the mole in the picture was...

270
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:31,767
Well, that wasn't a mole,

271
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:34,167
but something that flew on her when she hit

272
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:36,567
and knocked Mr. Kamoshita out with the shower nozzle.

273
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:38,967
It was his blood!

274
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:41,567
I see.

275
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:46,367
It looked like a black mole because the scene was static.

276
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:48,367
So, the killer took off all her clothes

277
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:50,867
to avoid getting blood on her yukata.

278
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:54,167
Yes. That's why the killer said

279
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:57,667
that she wanted to take a shower when she came to this room.

280
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,967
She probably said something like the shower broke

281
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:03,267
and lured Mr. Kamoshita into the shower room.

282
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:04,567
When he came in,

283
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:06,967
she hit him with the shower nozzle and knocked him out.

284
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:10,867
Without bothering to put on her clothes, she cut the video tape.

285
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:14,567
She then used it to strangle Mr. Kamoshita.

286
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:18,167
She was not aware at that time that her picture was being taken.

287
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:22,367
The killer wiped off the blood that splattered on her,

288
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,367
left the room, and put away the scissors

289
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:26,367
and screwdriver where they originally were.

290
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:28,067
She headed for the outdoor bath

291
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:30,767
to completely wash off the magnetic substance on her hand

292
00:15:30,767 --> 00:15:33,067
and the blood that splattered on herself.

293
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:34,867
Am I wrong?

294
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,367
The one who tried to hide the red mole,

295
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:38,867
Ms. Toshiko Bessho?

296
00:15:39,867 --> 00:15:42,467
She... she tried to hide it?

297
00:15:42,467 --> 00:15:45,167
Don't be ridiculous! She was the first one

298
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:46,867
who showed you her body of her own initiative!

299
00:15:46,867 --> 00:15:49,967
Yes. That was what bothered me.

300
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:52,467
Being as introverted as she is,

301
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:54,967
what she did was way out of line of her actual character.

302
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:56,767
That's when I realized

303
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:58,767
that it's a blind spot under the collar bone.

304
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:01,167
That the killer didn't know

305
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,167
that there was blood by her chest

306
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:06,067
until she saw that picture.

307
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:09,967
But there was no blood on her chest!

308
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:13,867
Of course it came off when she took a bath,

309
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:17,067
but the traces of it may be found if a body check is carried out.

310
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:19,067
That's why Ms. Bessho, afraid of this,

311
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:20,867
grabbed that part with her hand

312
00:16:20,867 --> 00:16:23,367
so that it would be out of view,

313
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:26,867
and made the police confirm that she had no mole.

314
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:29,867
All of that was to avoid a body check.

315
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:35,567
She didn't want the police to find Mr. Kamoshita's blood

316
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:38,667
that had splattered on the underwear of her kimono!

317
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:40,367
No way.

318
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:42,967
So, you did it?

319
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:45,167
You blackmailed Kazuki's agency

320
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:48,367
despite being his mother?

321
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:49,767
What?

322
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,167
Why did you do that?

323
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:54,467
It was a joke.

324
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:55,767
A joke?

325
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:57,867
I probably did it out of envy.

326
00:16:57,867 --> 00:17:00,767
I wanted a child really badly.

327
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:02,167
So, you're saying...

328
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:04,767
Yes, I'm not his mother.

329
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,667
The thing about his father being a killer is also a lie.

330
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:08,967
I thought that if I said so,

331
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:12,167
his agency would stop giving the postcards

332
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:14,067
that his mother had been sending to him.

333
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,467
But a while later,

334
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,867
money was really deposited into my account.

335
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:19,567
I was at a loss what to do,

336
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:22,767
and that was when that guy sniffed things out and came around.

337
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:26,367
I called this room and told him everything honestly.

338
00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:28,267
That everything I said was a lie.

339
00:17:28,267 --> 00:17:31,067
But that man had the nerve to laugh and...

340
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:35,167
Dear mother, I know how you feel about wanting to protect your child.

341
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:37,767
But you see, I'm doing business here.

342
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:40,567
Well, if it's really all baloney,

343
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:43,567
it's my turn to blackmail you this time.

344
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:45,967
I'll suck up to you for the rest of your life.

345
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:48,567
That's why I got scared.

346
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,967
I was scared, so I...

347
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:54,567
How did you find out the details

348
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:56,767
about Kazuki and his mother?

349
00:17:56,767 --> 00:17:59,467
I'll tell you about it at the station.

350
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:04,367
But officer, I don't regret what I did.

351
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:08,567
Because I think I made her understand how it feels

352
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:11,667
for a woman to want a child really badly.

353
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:18,067
What?

354
00:18:18,067 --> 00:18:21,367
So, Ms. Bessho was the killer?

355
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:24,667
Yes. Pops said he was going to Shizuoka Prefectural Police

356
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:28,467
for questioning together with the other officers.

357
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:29,967
He also said that he's leaving his wallet behind,

358
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:33,167
so you can take the kids home.

359
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:34,967
Where's Kazuki?

360
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:38,767
Oh, he got dressed and headed off to the front door

361
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:41,167
saying that he was leaving.

362
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:43,867
Wasn't he going to look for his mother?

363
00:18:43,867 --> 00:18:45,567
He was.

364
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:46,667
But he's been acting strange

365
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,267
ever since last night before he went to bed.

366
00:18:48,267 --> 00:18:51,067
He wouldn't answer no matter what I asked him.

367
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:54,467
I wonder if I should've carried him instead of piggy-backed him?

368
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,967
Come to think of it, Conan,

369
00:18:57,967 --> 00:19:01,667
you were saying that Kazuki's mother wasn't the killer.

370
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:05,567
Does that mean you know who Kazuki's mother is?

371
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:10,267
"To Ms. Mitsu"

372
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:12,067
-Here you go. -Thank you so much.

373
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,767
I'll treasure it.

374
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:14,867
Me too.

375
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:16,067
So will I.

376
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:18,267
Can I have get an autograph for my grandson?

377
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,267
She did not carry him in front, but piggy-backed him?

378
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:26,767
Yes! When Kazuki fell asleep while looking at the mole,

379
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:28,767
he heard his mother chopping food with the knife, right?

380
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:31,867
She couldn't have done so if she carried him in front of her.

381
00:19:31,867 --> 00:19:33,067
Oh, I see.

382
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:36,867
Kazuki was probably hugged when he was raised at church,

383
00:19:36,867 --> 00:19:39,667
so he probably mistakenly thought the mole was on his mother's chest.

384
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:41,067
So, you're saying that his mother

385
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:42,867
is the one with a mole on the back of her neck,

386
00:19:42,867 --> 00:19:44,167
Ms. Saegusa?

387
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:51,867
But she seemed so stuck up and cold towards him, didn't she?

388
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:54,167
She was acting that way deliberately

389
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:55,867
so he wouldn't recognize her as his mother.

390
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:59,967
She figured it would cause Kazuki problems if he found out.

391
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:01,567
I'm sure that Ms. Saegusa

392
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,567
had told the killer, Ms. Bessho about him.

393
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:07,467
About having no other choice but to leave him at church,

394
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:10,167
and how much she loved him.

395
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,967
Ms. Bessho probably figured out from the story

396
00:20:11,967 --> 00:20:15,167
and the postcards that she sent out every month,

397
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:17,667
that Ms. Saegusa was his mother.

398
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:20,267
The postcards stopped coming since winter of last year

399
00:20:20,267 --> 00:20:22,167
probably because Ms. Bessho blackmailed Kazuki's agency

400
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:23,367
just around that time,

401
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:26,567
so they stopped giving the postcards to Kazuki.

402
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:28,967
Pops was the one who said that!

403
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:31,567
But how does he know

404
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:33,367
that she left him at church because she had no choice?

405
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:35,167
Because if the son whom she wrote to every month

406
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,167
appears before her,

407
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:39,467
the first thing you'd expect her to do is to hug him!

408
00:20:39,467 --> 00:20:42,267
After all, he's famous and rich.

409
00:20:42,267 --> 00:20:45,267
Despite that, she held back her feelings and acted indifferently.

410
00:20:45,267 --> 00:20:49,067
That goes to show how much she must really care for him, right?

411
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:50,367
I guess you're right.

412
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,367
Ran?

413
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:56,867
I'm going to tell Kazuki about this.

414
00:20:56,867 --> 00:20:58,467
I feel sorry for him having to hold a grudge

415
00:20:58,467 --> 00:20:59,867
against his mother all his life.

416
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:04,767
On the contrary, I think he's dying to see her.

417
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:05,967
The fact that the postcards from his mother

418
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:08,067
are all wrinkled up and stained

419
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,967
only proves that he read them in tears over and over.

420
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:12,567
Besides, I'm sure Kazuki already knows

421
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:14,867
who his mother is.

422
00:21:14,867 --> 00:21:17,467
Go on. Why don't you get his autograph too?

423
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:19,067
No, I don't think so.

424
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:20,867
How come you're so hesitant?

425
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:24,967
You watched his videos and movies over and over too.

426
00:21:26,267 --> 00:21:27,467
Come on.

427
00:21:30,067 --> 00:21:31,467
I'm not giving you my autograph.

428
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:38,667
But I'll give you...

429
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:40,367
this instead.

430
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:44,367
I'll come again if you don't send these out.

431
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:52,467
Wait, Kazuki.

432
00:21:55,967 --> 00:21:57,967
"Postcards"

433
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:02,167
I'm sorry.

434
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:05,767
I'm so sorry, honey.

435
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:08,067
I'm sorry.

436
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:36,067
Three days later,

437
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:38,767
he received payment for the job he was asked to do.

438
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:40,267
What...

439
00:23:40,267 --> 00:23:43,367
What exactly is this?

440
00:23:44,267 --> 00:23:47,167
It looks like a piggy bank no matter what angle you look at it from.

441
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:49,067
No... no way.

442
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:51,767
Is this all he's paying us?

443
00:23:51,767 --> 00:23:54,967
-Maybe kid actors don't make much? -135 yen, 185 yen...

444
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,767
Let's see...

445
00:23:56,767 --> 00:24:00,367
I mean, this doesn't even cover the travel expenses!

446
00:24:31,994 --> 00:24:34,794
Next Conan's Hint:

447
00:24:34,794 --> 00:24:36,594
"Wind"

448
00:24:36,594 --> 00:24:37,594
The next episode is already time for the new semester!

449
00:24:37,594 --> 00:24:39,294
Movies and TV programs start together with Conan.

450
00:24:39,294 --> 00:24:40,894
The target is the Kid!
