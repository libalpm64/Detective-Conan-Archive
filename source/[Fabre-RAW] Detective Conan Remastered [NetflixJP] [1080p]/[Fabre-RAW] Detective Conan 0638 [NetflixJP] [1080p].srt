1
00:00:07,325 --> 00:00:09,989
That restaurant was surprisingly good.

2
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:12,925
Yeah, and that kind of price for lunch,

3
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:15,425
-it's a real bargain, right? -Right!

4
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:26,325
Look Out!

5
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:36,425
Darn you!

6
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,925
Oh no!

7
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:52,031
Are you all right?

8
00:00:52,225 --> 00:00:54,625
Yes, thank you very much.

9
00:00:56,325 --> 00:00:58,037
Like the fog clears.

10
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:00,325
Let's see through love and crime as well.

11
00:01:00,325 --> 00:01:02,425
A Japanese style mansion with complicated contraptions.

12
00:01:02,425 --> 00:01:04,043
An incident occurs at the Red Leaves Palace.

13
00:01:04,225 --> 00:01:06,045
He sees through the one and only truth.

14
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:07,825
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

15
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:10,049
His name is Detective Conan!

16
00:02:51,313 --> 00:02:55,313
"Solving the Mysteries at the Red Maple Palace (Part 1)"

17
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:05,313
Wow, somehow I feel sorry for troubling you guys!

18
00:03:05,313 --> 00:03:07,013
To think you'd invite us to your house

19
00:03:07,013 --> 00:03:09,513
despite us not doing much.

20
00:03:09,513 --> 00:03:14,173
Since we were saved by the renowned great detective Kogoro Mouri,

21
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:16,175
"Eiko Suzaka (48), chauffer" -our master insisted

22
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:18,613
upon meeting with you to express his gratitude.

23
00:03:22,413 --> 00:03:24,183
Doesn't this road...

24
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:27,013
lead to the Red Leaf Palace?

25
00:03:27,013 --> 00:03:28,913
That's my grandpa's house!

26
00:03:28,913 --> 00:03:33,213
What? Is that case, is she really that real estate king

27
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,195
Mr. Ouzaburo Katayose's granddaughter?

28
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:39,713
No, they are not blood related.

29
00:03:39,713 --> 00:03:43,113
Her parents died in a traffic accident.

30
00:03:43,113 --> 00:03:45,313
And he recently adopted her

31
00:03:45,313 --> 00:03:47,313
from her relatives living in Hokkaido.

32
00:03:47,313 --> 00:03:50,513
My name is Kaede Nakakita, eight years old!

33
00:03:50,513 --> 00:03:51,813
Nice to meet you!

34
00:03:51,813 --> 00:03:54,013
And you?

35
00:03:54,013 --> 00:03:55,313
I'm Conan Edogawa.

36
00:03:55,313 --> 00:03:57,313
I'm seven years old.

37
00:04:17,113 --> 00:04:18,813
Please come in.

38
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:29,413
Red leaves everywhere, I see.

39
00:04:32,413 --> 00:04:35,613
Who are those people, Suzaka?

40
00:04:35,613 --> 00:04:37,413
Milady Nobue.

41
00:04:37,413 --> 00:04:40,813
The truth is that we were saved from harm's way by these people.

42
00:04:42,713 --> 00:04:45,913
We were almost hit by a freak car!

43
00:04:45,913 --> 00:04:49,113
Thanks to this fine boy who called out to us.

44
00:04:50,713 --> 00:04:52,271
"Nobue Katayose (32), eldest daughter of Katayose"

45
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:55,013
A freak car, huh?

46
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:56,275
I see.

47
00:04:59,513 --> 00:05:01,213
Did someone drop by?

48
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:02,713
Big brother.

49
00:05:02,713 --> 00:05:06,285
They say Kaede almost got into an accident with a freak car.

50
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:07,513
"Ogito Katayose (35), eldest son of Katayose" -Accident?

51
00:05:07,513 --> 00:05:09,913
Bet it's because you were walking carelessly.

52
00:05:09,913 --> 00:05:12,313
And? Who're you guys?

53
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,613
He's the one who saved us back then.

54
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:18,297
The great detective Kogoro Mouri.

55
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:19,413
Kogoro Mouri?

56
00:05:19,413 --> 00:05:22,301
The...

57
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:24,013
That freak car was your doing, no?

58
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:25,913
Were you driving the car?

59
00:05:25,913 --> 00:05:28,307
My car's still inside the garage!

60
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:29,913
You're so adept at things like that,

61
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,913
you could've used a stolen car.

62
00:05:31,913 --> 00:05:35,013
The garden fence! You put a hole in it, didn't you?

63
00:05:35,013 --> 00:05:36,315
What are you talking about?

64
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:38,713
On the other side of the fence is a deep valley.

65
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,213
Kaede likes to play around there, doesn't she?

66
00:05:41,213 --> 00:05:43,113
Kaede, that is.

67
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,213
Oh, my bad.

68
00:05:49,213 --> 00:05:52,331
We both come from different mothers.

69
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:55,613
We're both adopted children who survived our deceased mothers.

70
00:05:55,613 --> 00:05:58,337
We're not blood related to our father.

71
00:05:58,513 --> 00:06:02,013
In a household like this, problems are bound to happen.

72
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:04,343
That's what's on your mind, isn't it?

73
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:08,347
No worries, Detective Mouri will help us capture

74
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:11,013
the culprit who made a hole in the fence!

75
00:06:11,013 --> 00:06:13,413
The driver behind the wheel of that weird car!

76
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:23,413
My sincerest apologies for your having to hear something like this.

77
00:06:23,413 --> 00:06:27,113
-Oh, no. -Well, please come in.

78
00:06:27,113 --> 00:06:29,413
The head of the household has been waiting for you.

79
00:06:29,413 --> 00:06:32,371
-Come on in, Conan! -Yeah.

80
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:40,379
This sure is a spacious manor.

81
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:43,913
I wonder how much further this corridor goes.

82
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:48,813
What's this?

83
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:54,413
-This is a painting. -What?

84
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,395
Peculiar, isn't it?

85
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:58,013
It's Mr. Katayose's hobby.

86
00:06:58,013 --> 00:07:00,913
They say it's called "trick art".

87
00:07:01,913 --> 00:07:04,113
Trick?

88
00:07:07,813 --> 00:07:10,713
A maple forest growing inside the house?

89
00:07:16,613 --> 00:07:18,013
Not quite.

90
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:20,213
While the trees immediately in front of us are real,

91
00:07:20,213 --> 00:07:22,421
those in the back are paintings.

92
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:24,423
What?

93
00:07:24,613 --> 00:07:27,613
Now that you mentioned it.

94
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,813
Pretty meticulous, I see!

95
00:07:29,813 --> 00:07:33,213
Huh? Where'd they go?

96
00:07:33,213 --> 00:07:35,813
Anyway, let's go on ahead.

97
00:07:39,513 --> 00:07:43,113
Don't tell me that this door's also a painting?

98
00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:44,443
Come on.

99
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:46,113
Maybe you need to push it?

100
00:07:46,113 --> 00:07:47,613
Oh, I see.

101
00:07:47,613 --> 00:07:50,449
Come on.

102
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:53,213
Trick art again?

103
00:07:53,213 --> 00:07:56,013
Maybe it's a sliding door that opens sideways?

104
00:07:57,613 --> 00:07:59,313
It opened.

105
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:05,513
Is Mr. Katayose's room over there?

106
00:08:05,513 --> 00:08:07,313
Seems so.

107
00:08:10,113 --> 00:08:12,013
This garden must be real, right?

108
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:13,413
Yeah.

109
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:18,113
Welcome.

110
00:08:28,913 --> 00:08:30,489
Please help yourselves in.

111
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:43,513
Welcome!

112
00:08:43,513 --> 00:08:45,413
I've been waiting for you, Conan.

113
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:48,507
Huh? Where's Mr. Katayose?

114
00:08:56,813 --> 00:08:59,813
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

115
00:08:59,813 --> 00:09:01,913
"Ouzaburo Katayose (68)" -Please have a seat.

116
00:09:01,913 --> 00:09:05,413
I am Ozaburo Katayose.

117
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:08,213
Wow! How should I put it?

118
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:09,813
Such extravagance.

119
00:09:09,813 --> 00:09:12,531
No, I mean, a fine hobby.

120
00:09:12,713 --> 00:09:15,913
Grandpa's "extravagances" are all fake!

121
00:09:15,913 --> 00:09:19,813
You can say so because you lived along with real nature, Kaede.

122
00:09:19,813 --> 00:09:21,713
I envy you.

123
00:09:21,713 --> 00:09:22,541
Due to circumstances,

124
00:09:22,713 --> 00:09:26,913
I adopted this child who lost her parents.

125
00:09:26,913 --> 00:09:30,113
To tell the truth, I regret it.

126
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,913
Master Katayose.

127
00:09:33,913 --> 00:09:36,013
I heard you were in danger again today.

128
00:09:36,013 --> 00:09:39,313
I'm truly sorry about that.

129
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:43,213
No, you don't need to apologize.

130
00:09:43,213 --> 00:09:46,013
It's what I'm the one who sowed the seed.

131
00:09:47,513 --> 00:09:51,013
I've provoked those not so good children.

132
00:09:56,313 --> 00:09:59,313
That was some vapid talk from me.

133
00:09:59,313 --> 00:10:01,913
Here, please try it.

134
00:10:01,913 --> 00:10:03,913
That milk was delivered straight from

135
00:10:03,913 --> 00:10:07,113
the ranch in Kaede's hometown.

136
00:10:07,113 --> 00:10:09,013
Any spoons, or...

137
00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:12,613
My apologies, but I don't use spoons.

138
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:15,913
Enjoying the milk patterns drifting about in the cup

139
00:10:15,913 --> 00:10:17,613
is my joie de vivre.

140
00:10:17,613 --> 00:10:19,613
Call him stubborn.

141
00:10:19,613 --> 00:10:22,601
He will never even consider putting sugar in.

142
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:25,913
Please help yourselves to these.

143
00:10:25,913 --> 00:10:27,813
Detective Mouri,

144
00:10:27,813 --> 00:10:30,609
I reckon you'd prefer sake instead?

145
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:32,611
Well, well...

146
00:10:34,013 --> 00:10:37,213
In fact, I have matters I really need to consult with you.

147
00:10:37,213 --> 00:10:40,213
But unfortunately, I already have a meeting set at 3:00.

148
00:10:40,213 --> 00:10:41,713
After that's over,

149
00:10:41,713 --> 00:10:45,113
how about we talk over a few cups of sake?

150
00:10:45,113 --> 00:10:47,513
It would be my honor to join you.

151
00:10:50,013 --> 00:10:52,213
Too sweet!

152
00:10:52,213 --> 00:10:55,513
Please show him to the guest room.

153
00:10:55,513 --> 00:10:57,013
Understood.

154
00:10:57,813 --> 00:11:00,113
See, these are genuine!

155
00:11:05,213 --> 00:11:07,613
What a superb garden!

156
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:10,649
They don't call this place "Red Leaf Palace" for nothing!

157
00:11:13,313 --> 00:11:15,513
I'll clean up.

158
00:11:15,513 --> 00:11:16,913
I'm fine. I'm fine.

159
00:11:16,913 --> 00:11:19,613
It's a good distraction for me to move about.

160
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:22,661
After all, my body won't last much longer.

161
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:30,669
He's got cancer and doesn't have much longer to live.

162
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:32,671
He's prepared for it.

163
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:34,213
Mr. Katayose, I mean.

164
00:11:34,213 --> 00:11:36,013
Is that so?

165
00:11:36,013 --> 00:11:39,313
-Over here! -Wait up!

166
00:11:39,313 --> 00:11:41,813
-Huh? -What's wrong?

167
00:11:41,813 --> 00:11:44,113
I thought the mountains were still a bit away,

168
00:11:44,113 --> 00:11:45,813
but it's actually this close?

169
00:11:45,813 --> 00:11:47,913
Grandpa's pretty proud of that.

170
00:11:47,913 --> 00:11:51,413
He said he tried to mimic the Hachiman shrine in Kamakura.

171
00:11:51,413 --> 00:11:53,913
Oh, the raised pathway (dankazura).

172
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:56,695
By using the forced perspective effect,

173
00:11:56,695 --> 00:12:00,213
the pathway will appear to be much longer.

174
00:12:02,113 --> 00:12:04,413
Conan, look at that!

175
00:12:05,713 --> 00:12:07,413
It's my tree house.

176
00:12:07,413 --> 00:12:09,513
Grandpa made me that.

177
00:12:09,513 --> 00:12:11,813
Kaede, you're just like a boy.

178
00:12:11,813 --> 00:12:13,913
You got it! See?

179
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:19,413
All right.

180
00:12:19,413 --> 00:12:21,313
Conan, climb up too.

181
00:12:21,313 --> 00:12:23,113
All right.

182
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:28,413
This was cut by a knife.

183
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:31,313
So it is true that Kaede's life's in danger.

184
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:36,735
Then, does that mean

185
00:12:36,913 --> 00:12:39,513
you're not related to the Katayose family at all?

186
00:12:39,513 --> 00:12:41,213
That's right.

187
00:12:41,213 --> 00:12:44,743
Grandpa said my grandma was his best friend.

188
00:12:44,913 --> 00:12:48,313
I don't remember anything about grandma, though.

189
00:12:48,313 --> 00:12:50,749
Then, why were you adopted?

190
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:52,013
I don't know.

191
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:54,113
Grandpa can be forceful sometimes.

192
00:12:54,113 --> 00:12:55,513
He adopted me despite my uncle at the ranch

193
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:58,757
agreeing to take care of me himself.

194
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,913
I want to go back.

195
00:13:05,013 --> 00:13:07,613
-Conan! Come, show me how to play soccer! -What?

196
00:13:07,613 --> 00:13:10,769
You whipped a soccer ball up like magic earlier, didn't you?

197
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:13,513
I'm surprised you noticed at a time like that!

198
00:13:13,513 --> 00:13:16,775
But that ball will go completely flat within ten seconds.

199
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:21,213
I also have a ball in my house!

200
00:13:23,813 --> 00:13:25,813
I'll be the goalkeeper!

201
00:13:25,813 --> 00:13:28,787
You might fall into the pond if you stand there.

202
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:30,113
I won't drop it!

203
00:13:30,113 --> 00:13:32,413
I don't mean the ball, I mean you.

204
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:34,213
I won't fall either!

205
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:37,113
She's a handful.

206
00:13:39,513 --> 00:13:42,313
Kick it stronger.

207
00:13:42,313 --> 00:13:43,813
Got it.

208
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:46,413
Give it all you got! You're a boy, aren't you?

209
00:13:46,413 --> 00:13:48,113
All right!

210
00:13:54,513 --> 00:13:55,613
I'm sorry.

211
00:13:55,613 --> 00:13:58,613
I'm sorry, grandpa!

212
00:13:58,613 --> 00:14:00,413
He's with a guest, right?

213
00:14:00,413 --> 00:14:02,813
Seems so since it's after 3:00.

214
00:14:05,713 --> 00:14:08,813
-What's wrong? -I heard a growl.

215
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:10,813
I'm coming in.

216
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,213
Grandpa!

217
00:14:19,013 --> 00:14:21,513
Steam is still coming from the cup.

218
00:14:21,513 --> 00:14:24,113
-The culprit's still around here! -What?

219
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:29,613
Ran!

220
00:14:29,613 --> 00:14:31,413
Did someone come out from the annex?

221
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:35,613
Someone? No, nobody came out.

222
00:14:35,613 --> 00:14:36,855
Where's Pops?

223
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:38,857
He's sleeping in the guest room.

224
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:40,213
What happened?

225
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,413
Hurry up and call him.

226
00:14:44,613 --> 00:14:46,513
This is...

227
00:14:50,613 --> 00:14:53,313
-He's dead. -What?

228
00:14:54,873 --> 00:14:57,913
Grandpa!

229
00:14:57,913 --> 00:15:00,013
Someone should've been here, right?

230
00:15:00,013 --> 00:15:04,013
Yeah. Look, the cup is still steaming.

231
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:08,887
Looks like his death was the result of cyanide poisoning.

232
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:11,313
What's all this racket about?

233
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,313
Pops!

234
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:17,813
What's wrong with father?

235
00:15:20,613 --> 00:15:21,813
Master!

236
00:15:21,813 --> 00:15:24,903
Please refrain from contaminating the scene!

237
00:15:28,013 --> 00:15:30,313
Is this... this a murder case?

238
00:15:31,313 --> 00:15:33,413
Nobue, was it you?

239
00:15:33,413 --> 00:15:36,313
What the... Was it you?

240
00:15:36,313 --> 00:15:38,213
You finally freaking did it!

241
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:41,813
Cut the nonsense! I merely waited in my room!

242
00:15:41,813 --> 00:15:44,413
You were the one he called out first, no?

243
00:15:44,413 --> 00:15:47,613
-The culprit is this man! -She was the one who did it!

244
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,413
Grandpa is dead.

245
00:15:51,713 --> 00:15:53,813
Kaede.

246
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:06,472
Where were you at the time of the incident?

247
00:16:06,472 --> 00:16:09,972
I was in the garage cleaning the cars.

248
00:16:09,972 --> 00:16:12,372
Is there anyone who can verify that?

249
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,953
No, because I was all by myself.

250
00:16:15,172 --> 00:16:18,957
The guest who was meeting with Mr. Katayose from 3:00...

251
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:20,959
You have no idea who it was?

252
00:16:21,172 --> 00:16:23,872
That is correct.

253
00:16:23,872 --> 00:16:26,672
Since the conversation seemed to be quite a private one,

254
00:16:26,672 --> 00:16:28,967
I didn't dare inquire further.

255
00:16:29,172 --> 00:16:33,772
Does that mean the guest was either Ogito or Nobue?

256
00:16:33,772 --> 00:16:37,472
Or it could have been both of them.

257
00:16:37,472 --> 00:16:40,979
Have you any idea what kind of conversation it was?

258
00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:44,983
Well, it would likely reveal Mr. Katayose's embarrassment.

259
00:17:00,672 --> 00:17:03,001
Hello?

260
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:05,472
Yes, I'll definitely pay you next month.

261
00:17:06,472 --> 00:17:09,007
What? You can't wait that long?

262
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:10,472
But...

263
00:17:13,272 --> 00:17:16,272
Understood. I'll figure out a way.

264
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:21,572
Darn it!

265
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:25,023
It'll be too late if I have to wait for my share of the inheritance!

266
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:27,025
What should I do?

267
00:17:27,272 --> 00:17:30,472
Mirror, mirror, tell me now.

268
00:17:30,472 --> 00:17:33,372
Which dress should I wear to the funeral?

269
00:17:35,572 --> 00:17:37,035
No way.

270
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:39,872
I can't declare bankruptcy now!

271
00:17:39,872 --> 00:17:43,041
At least give me one more month.

272
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,572
Those two, immoral people...

273
00:17:45,572 --> 00:17:49,047
They went after nothing else but Mr. Katayose's fortune.

274
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:51,672
Mr. Katayose, who had prepared for his death

275
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:55,072
would have had to talk to those two in due course.

276
00:17:55,072 --> 00:17:59,072
However, we have no idea which of them was called first.

277
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:03,061
Inspector, that was forensics.

278
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:06,572
The milk in the pitcher tested positive for poison.

279
00:18:07,872 --> 00:18:09,972
It's a simple case then!

280
00:18:09,972 --> 00:18:11,772
The son and the daughter must have known well

281
00:18:11,772 --> 00:18:15,073
about Mr. Ouzaburo's affinity to milk tea.

282
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:16,272
He or she took the chance

283
00:18:16,272 --> 00:18:19,672
and mixed poison into the pitcher.

284
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:23,572
The only question is which of them did it?

285
00:18:23,572 --> 00:18:27,085
But Pops, how did the culprit escape?

286
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:28,072
Huh?

287
00:18:28,072 --> 00:18:30,372
What're you talking about?

288
00:18:30,372 --> 00:18:32,372
Yeah. I had been standing in the corridor

289
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:34,572
for twenty minutes prior to the incident,

290
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:37,095
but no one came out from the annex.

291
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:39,097
Kaede and I were in the garden

292
00:18:39,272 --> 00:18:41,099
and were watching the annex the entire time,

293
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:43,772
but no one stepped out!

294
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:48,072
In that case, the culprit had no place to escape.

295
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:51,972
So, was it a sealed room murder?

296
00:18:51,972 --> 00:18:53,672
They must have concealed themselves

297
00:18:53,672 --> 00:18:55,572
in Mr. Ouzaburo's hidden room.

298
00:18:55,572 --> 00:18:58,872
It's behind that painting of the cottage door on that wall.

299
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:01,572
And when Conan ran away from the scene,

300
00:19:01,572 --> 00:19:05,123
they secretly came out and fled, no doubt.

301
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:08,172
Kaede was still in annex though.

302
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:11,129
She was stunned by her grandpa's death and lost her composure,

303
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:12,872
so she didn't notice.

304
00:19:12,872 --> 00:19:18,272
But, doesn't that door make a loud creaking sound when opened?

305
00:19:20,272 --> 00:19:22,072
If a loud noise like that had sounded,

306
00:19:22,072 --> 00:19:25,143
I bet even we could have heard it in the corridor!

307
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:28,172
That's because...

308
00:19:28,172 --> 00:19:31,972
But then, where on earth did the culprit vanish to?

309
00:19:37,572 --> 00:19:39,972
Miss, what's wrong?

310
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:41,159
Nothing.

311
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:45,163
Just thinking that Kaede is probably awake by now.

312
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:47,572
She was exhausted and cried herself to sleep.

313
00:19:47,572 --> 00:19:51,872
There isn't a place in this house that's free from care.

314
00:19:51,872 --> 00:19:54,372
Feel free to go check on her.

315
00:20:01,872 --> 00:20:03,181
What shall I do?

316
00:20:03,372 --> 00:20:05,172
Miss!

317
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:08,572
Let me go check on Kaede with you.

318
00:20:08,572 --> 00:20:11,189
That's... What room is the key for?

319
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:15,972
Guess I really need to report this to the Inspector.

320
00:20:16,872 --> 00:20:19,472
So he really did have hidden assets!

321
00:20:19,472 --> 00:20:23,201
Why didn't you turn the key in to me instead of the cops?

322
00:20:25,472 --> 00:20:28,472
This is private information among the Katayose family!

323
00:20:28,472 --> 00:20:31,209
Only after we deem it irrelevant to the case,

324
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:33,211
will we abide to his will.

325
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:36,972
However, Mr. Katayose secretly entrusted Miss Suzaka

326
00:20:36,972 --> 00:20:38,872
with that key, you know?

327
00:20:38,872 --> 00:20:44,172
He said he would like me to hold on to this indefinitely if possible.

328
00:20:44,172 --> 00:20:47,572
Now that Pops is dead, the entire house will become mine.

329
00:20:47,572 --> 00:20:50,272
-I'm still here! -Shut up!

330
00:20:50,272 --> 00:20:52,472
Hey! Open it up already!

331
00:20:52,472 --> 00:20:54,172
Yes.

332
00:20:57,772 --> 00:21:00,672
-There's something! -Bet it's a check!

333
00:21:00,672 --> 00:21:02,872
So Pops planned to give it to this woman.

334
00:21:02,872 --> 00:21:04,372
That's not true.

335
00:21:04,372 --> 00:21:07,245
-I'll take a look! -I will.

336
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:14,672
-Hey, brat. -Hand it to me.

337
00:21:14,672 --> 00:21:17,572
What? Something weird's written on it!

338
00:21:17,572 --> 00:21:18,672
What?

339
00:21:18,672 --> 00:21:20,272
Let's see...

340
00:21:20,272 --> 00:21:22,872
Now, close the umbrella.

341
00:21:22,872 --> 00:21:25,972
Gaze at the evening sun setting in the east.

342
00:21:25,972 --> 00:21:29,272
Look at the two rods holding up the red leaves.

343
00:21:29,272 --> 00:21:31,672
Search for a longer rod.

344
00:21:31,672 --> 00:21:35,672
My dream of the red leaves shall lie dormant there.

345
00:21:35,672 --> 00:21:37,275
What's that?

346
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:38,572
A code?

347
00:21:38,572 --> 00:21:41,872
Could it be the location of the hidden assets?

348
00:21:50,572 --> 00:21:52,272
The code...

349
00:21:52,272 --> 00:21:55,772
Does it really lead to the location of a hidden fortune?

350
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,572
If so, why did he entrust Miss Suzaka with it?

351
00:21:58,572 --> 00:22:02,972
And the culprit who murdered Mr. Ouzaburo?

352
00:22:02,972 --> 00:22:05,303
What is the mystery behind the sealed room?

353
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,872
I need inheritance money instantly!

354
00:23:30,872 --> 00:23:32,672
If only I could crack the code!

355
00:23:35,172 --> 00:23:36,972
Wait!

356
00:23:36,972 --> 00:23:39,172
The meaning of that...

357
00:23:39,172 --> 00:23:40,872
I see.

358
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,272
That was scary.

359
00:23:46,272 --> 00:23:50,272
But it looks like that guy figured something out.

360
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:54,072
That's it. I'll just wait for Ogito to solve the code.

361
00:23:54,072 --> 00:23:57,415
I'll simply take everything away afterwards.

362
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,196
Next Conan's Hint:

363
00:24:04,196 --> 00:24:05,880
"Electric current"

364
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,228
I'll solve the code and the inheritance is mine!

365
00:24:08,228 --> 00:24:09,782
-Pops! -Just joking.

366
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:10,980
That's a joke?
