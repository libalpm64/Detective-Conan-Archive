1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,960
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,760
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,360
Let's relax and watch the stars tonight.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,360
Let's shatter alibis as if they were shooting stars.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,060
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,860
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,160
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:43,070
"The Astronomical Observation"

9
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,870
"Nagano Prefecture Mt. Hoshimi Sanatorium"

10
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,640
"11:20 p.m."

11
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,280
A polar cap!

12
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,770
Ran, let me see too!

13
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,170
I'm sorry. Here, go ahead.

14
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,670
Wow! You can say that again.

15
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,670
Gosh, there are no shooting stars around at all.

16
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,070
Come on, Sonoko.

17
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,270
Why don't you quit looking for shooting stars,

18
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,070
and look through the telescope for a change?

19
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,470
No way.

20
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,970
I'm going to find a shooting star

21
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,270
and wish for a good-looking steady.

22
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,770
Gosh. Just what did you buy this fantastic telescope for

23
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,470
and bring it all the way here?

24
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,670
Well, isn't it strange to come look at the stars

25
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,970
and not have a telescope?

26
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,970
It's even stranger not to look through the telescope that you brought.

27
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,070
A shooting star!

28
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,970
What? Where?

29
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,770
It vanished.

30
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,370
I didn't get to see it because you were talking to me, Ran!

31
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,270
-Ran. -Yes?

32
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,870
How is it? Is it working okay now?

33
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,270
Mr. Eda. Thanks a lot a while ago.

34
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,270
Who is he?

35
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,870
He is Mr. Eda, an upper graduate of Tohto University.

36
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,170
He taught me how to use this telescope

37
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,770
while you were taking a snooze a while ago.

38
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,770
Hey, Eda.

39
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,070
Hello there.

40
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,270
If you've got time to be picking girls up,

41
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,170
start collecting data right, will you?

42
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,970
Come off it, it's nothing like that.

43
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,770
They are...

44
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,070
my upper classmen at the university, Koichi Nonaka

45
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,470
and Hiroshi Akimoto.

46
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,370
Hello.

47
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,770
How do you do? I'm Ran Mouri.

48
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,770
He is Conan, and she is...

49
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,870
Hello, I'm Sonoko Suzuki.

50
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,270
I love stars, so today...

51
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,770
Now I remember!

52
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,870
Weren't you on TV yesterday, Mr. Nonaka?

53
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,470
You were awarded this what-you-may-call show, weren't you?

54
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,370
Yes. I was awarded the Star Pioneer Award,

55
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,970
which is considered the Nobel Prize in the field of astronomy.

56
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,970
And I'm history's youngest recipient of this award, too.

57
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,070
Is it normal to brag about oneself?

58
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,070
What's with him, anyway?

59
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,370
Mr. Nonaka. Is the filming turning out all right?

60
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,870
Yeah. Only I'm so sleepy

61
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,770
that I came to get a cup of coffee.

62
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,470
Where are you filming?

63
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,970
There, by that TV broadcast tower.

64
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,670
That's pretty far.

65
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,270
But it's only takes about 2 or 3 minutes by car.

66
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,470
Akimoto and I are rolling our cameras

67
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,970
at the center of that broadcast tower and filming.

68
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,570
Since I received the award,

69
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,970
he bought the same type of camera I had.

70
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,170
Yeah. I've been using it since yesterday,

71
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,770
but after I got the same camera as his,

72
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,270
it's a lot easier filming.

73
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,070
Have you been here since yesterday?

74
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,570
No, I came here first

75
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,470
because of the stars that I had to film.

76
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,470
Hey, Akimoto. It's about time we get going.

77
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,570
-Yeah. -Give it your best shot!

78
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,470
Oh, right! If you look to the south around 11:30 to 12 a.m.,

79
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,070
you'll see an earth satellite shoot across the sky.

80
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,870
Really?

81
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,370
Yeah, I don't think you'll have any trouble finding it.

82
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,070
-Bye. -Hey, don't tell me you're picking up girls too.

83
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,570
Oh, come on.

84
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,070
Just as expected of Akimoto.

85
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:18,270
I know nothing about the orbit of earth satellites.

86
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,370
Ran, which do you prefer?

87
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,670
Oh, not again.

88
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,970
What did you guys come to observe anyway?

89
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,870
"11:50 p.m."

90
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,270
Oh, my neck's stiff and starting to hurt.

91
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,270
There is no earth satellite in sight, is there.

92
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,870
Mr. Akimoto.

93
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,470
Well? Did you get to see the satellite?

94
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,270
No, not at all.

95
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,470
What's up, Mr. Akimoto?

96
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,770
I'm filming between 9 p.m. to 3 a.m.

97
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,170
Since I have nothing to do during that time, I decided to come back.

98
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,670
Don't you have to keep watch over the ���m�֧ԧ�?

99
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,770
No. The filming that we are performing now

100
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,770
is called the fixed filming method.

101
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:02,770
That is, the shutter of the camera

102
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,170
is left opened for a certain duration of time.

103
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,870
That's why I don't have to be by the camera

104
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,470
while the pictures are being taken.

105
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,670
I know about it.

106
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,570
The stars come out in a straight line

107
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,170
when the picture is taken, right?

108
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,970
That's right. You're sure knowledgeable, Conan.

109
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,770
What is Mr. Nonaka doing?

110
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,270
He's back at the broadcast tower.

111
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,870
He has to take pictures starting from 9 p.m. to 12 a.m.

112
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,370
and from 12 a.m. to 3 a.m.

113
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,070
So, he has to operate the camera at 12 a.m.

114
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,170
That's right.

115
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,970
Why don't we take a look at him through the telescope?

116
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,170
I'll bet he's yawning away from sleepiness.

117
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:43,670
"12:15 a.m."

118
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,370
I can't really get a clear view.

119
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,870
Although I can sort of tell that someone is standing.

120
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,370
He's looking this way too,

121
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,470
and yawning just like I expected.

122
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,170
Nonaka fell.

123
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,070
Mr. Akimoto.

124
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,670
You have a cellular phone on you, don't you?

125
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,470
-Yes. -I'll rush over to Nonaka,

126
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,870
so you call the police and come right after doing so.

127
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,070
All right!

128
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,370
Hey, Conan!

129
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,970
"12:20 a.m."

130
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,370
Mr. Akimoto.

131
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,570
Mr. Nonaka!

132
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,770
Too late.

133
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,670
Nonaka.

134
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,270
"12:25 a.m."

135
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,870
So, it's over here.

136
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,470
The railing is low

137
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,970
and the ground is slippery from night dew.

138
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,870
So, this is an accident after all.

139
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,770
What's this?

140
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,670
A ball of wool.

141
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,270
Why would something like this be in a place like this?

142
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,570
This scratch is still new.

143
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,870
The paint that has peeled off also looks unnatural.

144
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,470
The release button on both cameras are pressed down.

145
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,370
Which means they are still taking pictures.

146
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,270
Conan, you should know better than to run around on your own.

147
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,370
Mr. Akimoto.

148
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,570
These cameras are yours and Mr. Nonaka's, aren't they?

149
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,970
Yeah. The one over there is Nonaka's,

150
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,170
and this one is mine.

151
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,170
I guess this is no time to be taking pictures.

152
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,370
12:30 a.m. end of filming.

153
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,070
12:30 a.m. end of filming.

154
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,270
So, this has turned out to be Nonaka's last pictures.

155
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:57,270
"2:00 a.m."

156
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,970
All set.

157
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,270
Roger.

158
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:09,070
So, you all witnessed Mr. Nonaka fall from there?

159
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,070
Yes...

160
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,670
I was watching him through the telescope,

161
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,070
but it looked to me as if he lost his balance

162
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,470
when he leaned out over the railing.

163
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,470
Do you have the exact time that he fell?

164
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,670
I'm sure it was around 12:15 a.m.

165
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,070
I was looking at my watch every so often

166
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,370
because I wanted to see the twin star.

167
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,370
Mr. Detective.

168
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:37,370
I think that Mr. Nonaka was standing more to the right.

169
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,070
You must've seen wrong because it was dark.

170
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,970
Oh, I wonder!

171
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,770
These are the pictures that were taken by Mr. Nonaka.

172
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,270
From the results of what the specialists came up with,

173
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,470
this picture was taken from 9 p.m. to 12 a.m.

174
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,970
And this from 12 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.

175
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,270
It's been confirmed that these pictures

176
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,070
were taken at the broadcast tower.

177
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,770
Mr. Akimoto, you closed the shutter of Mr. Nonaka's camera

178
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,270
at 12:30 a.m., is that right?

179
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,470
Yes, that 's right.

180
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,070
Judging from these two pictures,

181
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,570
Mr. Nonaka probably operated his camera at 12 a.m.

182
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,670
and started his second filming then at 12:15 a.m.

183
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:27,370
He slipped on the wet ground and fell.

184
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,170
There is nothing suspicious about the site either.

185
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,670
There seems to have been none other than yourselves

186
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,270
who have gone in and out of here too,

187
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:37,270
so we'll have to say that this was an unfortunate accident.

188
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:40,870
No, this is not an accident.

189
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,470
Mr. Akimoto is lying.

190
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,070
How were Akimoto and Nonaka getting along?

191
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:52,770
When they were talking about the Star Pioneer Award at the roof,

192
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,370
I was a little worried

193
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,970
because Mr. Akimoto looked angry.

194
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:01,070
Oh, that... Mr. Nonaka's to blame.

195
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,870
The research that he was awarded for was actually

196
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,070
a joint research that they were both working on together.

197
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,870
But Mr. Nonaka went ahead and introduced it as his own.

198
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,770
What? I could never do observation

199
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,370
with somebody who did something like that to me.

200
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,570
Me neither.

201
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,570
But Mr. Akimoto is the one who set this observation up,

202
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,970
saying that he's not bothered about the award.

203
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,670
What did you drop, Conan?

204
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,970
Oh, the button of my jacket.

205
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,270
I wonder where I dropped it.

206
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,570
Even if Mr. Akimoto were to be the killer,

207
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:49,170
he was watching Mr. Nonaka fall to his death at 12:15 a.m.

208
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,270
together with all of us.

209
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,670
No, wait a sec.

210
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,170
What we saw was the figure of a person.

211
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,870
We didn't actually see Mr. Nonaka.

212
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,770
A thing that looked to be the figure of a person.

213
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,570
Even if it were a doll, we couldn't have made out the difference.

214
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,370
No, that's not it.

215
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,670
There was no doll when we got here.

216
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,570
Mr. Akimoto may have arrived here before us,

217
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,170
but he was still in his car when we got here.

218
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,470
It'd have been impossible for him to hide the doll.

219
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,270
Besides, somebody was always near Mr. Akimoto

220
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,370
since Mr. Nonaka fell to his death.

221
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,670
Huh?

222
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,670
What's the matter, Mr. Eda?

223
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,870
I dropped my car key.

224
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,970
Oh, there, I found it!

225
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,870
That's an example of overlooking something worth while close at hand.

226
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,370
I got it!

227
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,770
It's over there!

228
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,470
Thank you, Mr. Eda.

229
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,670
Just as I thought!

230
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,270
He could do it if he used that method.

231
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,970
But I've got no proof.

232
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,570
And besides, those two pictures...

233
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,670
I'm sure there's some kind of trick to those pictures.

234
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:15,070
What a bummer.

235
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,070
There's an accident, I don't get to see shooting stars.

236
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,770
-What luck. -Sonoko!

237
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,470
I've found it!

238
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,570
I've found decisive evidence.

239
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,260
Thank you for your cooperation

240
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,060
despite the late hour, everyone.

241
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,160
We are quite positive that this is an accident, so...

242
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,360
I guess I didn't get enough sleep.

243
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,560
Hey, Sonoko.

244
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,060
What's the matter, Sonoko?

245
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,860
I'm fine, Conan.

246
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,960
Mr. Detective.

247
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,960
What is it?

248
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,060
Mr. Nonaka death is not an accident.

249
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,360
He was killed by Mr. Akimoto over there.

250
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,660
What?

251
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,460
When Mr. Akimoto went back to the broadcast tower

252
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,360
with Mr. Nonaka at a little after 11:30 p.m.,

253
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,160
he pushed Mr. Nonaka over and killed him.

254
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,260
He told us about the earth satellite

255
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,460
to divert our attention to the opposite side

256
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:25,360
so that we wouldn't see him committing the murder.

257
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,660
But, didn't you all see Mr. Nonaka fall?

258
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,860
We did see a doll fall, not Mr. Nonaka.

259
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,460
A doll?

260
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,260
Yes. Mr. Akimoto placed the doll a little distance away

261
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,960
from where he pushed Mr. Nonaka over,

262
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,960
and fixed the doll onto the railing using a strong string,

263
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,160
such as a fishing line.

264
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,560
As proof of that,

265
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,360
there is a brand new scratch on the railing.

266
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,260
And at 12:15 a.m.,

267
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,260
the doll was dropped by the timer that was set to it.

268
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,060
Mr. Akimoto made us witness that event,

269
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,560
as well at witness it himself,

270
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,560
thereby setting up a perfect alibi for himself.

271
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,460
What a thing to say.

272
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,060
When you all reached the broadcast tower,

273
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,260
did you see any doll there?

274
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,460
Yes, there was. Under your car.

275
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,160
Arriving at the broadcast tower a little before us,

276
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,360
you drove right over the doll and stopped

277
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,660
so that we wouldn't see it.

278
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,860
And while we were all absorbed in Mr. Nonaka's corpse,

279
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,260
you threw the doll into your car.

280
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,360
The doll that you made using an orange blanket and fishing line.

281
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,660
That's no more than your deductive logic.

282
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,960
I did indeed use the orange blanket that was in my car.

283
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,060
But I used it to wrap myself in it

284
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,660
because it was so cold at the broadcast tower.

285
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,860
Although you were the first to reach the broadcast tower,

286
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,860
you were the last one to go up to Mr. Nonaka's corpse.

287
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,160
Nonaka.

288
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,660
What on earth were you doing?

289
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,260
Well... But, Sonoko,

290
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,660
aren't those two pictures proof

291
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,360
that Nonaka was alive until midnight?

292
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,360
It's true that someone needs to be near the camera to operate it.

293
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,860
Which means that it would've been impossible for me

294
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,260
to operate the camera since I was here all through

295
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,560
besides Sonoko and the others from 11:50 p.m.,

296
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,960
much less kill him...

297
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,260
If you still insist on me being the killer,

298
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,060
let's have you show us some legitimate evidence.

299
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,060
Detective Yamada.

300
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,360
Mr. Akimoto's pictures that you requested are ready.

301
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,660
Mr. Akimoto's pictures?

302
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,660
I asked Conan to relay the message.

303
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,560
Those pictures are the evidence.

304
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,360
What?

305
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,360
What on earth are you talking about?

306
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,160
Investigation officer, please compare the pictures

307
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,260
that were taken by Mr. Nonaka from 9:00 p.m. to midnight,

308
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,960
to the ones that were taken by Mr. Akimoto.

309
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,360
All right.

310
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,060
This one is Mr. Akimoto's picture.

311
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,360
What is this?

312
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,960
A shooting star.

313
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,160
You saw a shooting star

314
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,760
going across the sky to the north, didn't you?

315
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,260
Although I didn't get to see it.

316
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,960
Yes, I did.

317
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,760
Mr. Akimoto and Mr. Nonaka were supposed to

318
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,760
have been taking pictures at the same time, of the same direction.

319
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,260
And yet, the shooting star is in Mr. Akimoto's picture

320
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,960
and not in Mr. Nonaka's.

321
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,960
This proves that Mr. Nonaka's pictures were not taken today.

322
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:44,160
If so, it would mean that Mr. Akimoto's alibi is not reliable,

323
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,260
despite his having been here at the roof.

324
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,660
Exactly.

325
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,860
Mr. Akimoto.

326
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,460
You took those two pictures yesterday

327
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,360
with the same camera that Mr. Nonaka had

328
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,860
in order to take pictures under the exact filming conditions as today.

329
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,960
This is a crime that only you who knew

330
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,360
about Mr. Nonaka's filming plan could've committed.

331
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,560
And after you pushed Mr. Nonaka over today,

332
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,460
you set the blanket up,

333
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,860
took the film out of Mr. Nonaka's camera

334
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,060
and exchanged it with the film that you had already used yesterday.

335
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,260
But there was a defect to this trick.

336
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,660
That is the sound of the shutter.

337
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,360
The sound of the shutter?

338
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,860
Yes. After the film is exchanged,

339
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,860
you can't leave the shutter open.

340
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,660
That is, you can't leave it in the filming mode.

341
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,360
If you do so, the pictures that were taken today

342
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,060
would double expose on yesterday's pictures,

343
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,060
and the trick would be revealed.

344
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:45,460
That's why he had to leave the shutter closed.

345
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,460
I see. When he pushed the shutter at 12:30 a.m.,

346
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,960
there was a possibility that someone would notice

347
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,160
there was no sound when he did so.

348
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,760
I'm sure that Mr. Akimoto figured that

349
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,760
everyone would be so upset over Mr. Nonaka's death,

350
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,360
to notice such a thing.

351
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,260
But Conan noticed it.

352
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,760
Yes, the shutter made no sound back then.

353
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,260
It did seem like Mr. Akimoto was trying

354
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:12,560
to keep everyone from noticing by shouting though.

355
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,360
That means that Mr. Nonaka's camera

356
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,960
was not taking pictures, right?

357
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,260
But still, Mr. Akimoto mentioned that

358
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,160
he closed the shutter at 12:30 a.m.

359
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,060
Besides, the pictures of the stars up to 12:30 a.m. are taken.

360
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,260
So, I was wondering what was going on.

361
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,960
The picture wasn't being taken

362
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,160
and yet, pictures of them exist.

363
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,260
And, you, Mr. Akimoto are the only one

364
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,160
who could've done something like this!

365
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,460
Since when did you start suspecting me?

366
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,460
When Mr. Nonaka fell,

367
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,160
you made Mr. Eda call the police, didn't you?

368
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,360
We would usually call an ambulance first.

369
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,960
You made him call the police

370
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,360
because you already knew that Mr. Nonaka was dead.

371
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,060
You're really some girl.

372
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,060
So, Mr. Akimoto,

373
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,460
you never really forgave Mr. Nonaka after all.

374
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,460
It was my dream to be awarded the Star Pioneer Award.

375
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,060
I didn't care if the research was a joint project if to receive it.

376
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,860
But that Nonaka had the nerve to hog the award all for himself.

377
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,960
I could never forgive him!

378
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,660
I never even noticed a shooting star

379
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,360
going across the sky to the north at a little after 11 p.m.

380
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,660
I was too busy looking towards Nonaka that I was going to kill,

381
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,860
that I wasn't even looking at the sky.

382
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,260
Did I sleep well?

383
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,060
You're really something, Sonoko.

384
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,060
Your deduction this time was as fantastic as always.

385
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,860
Huh?

386
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,960
It's morning already?

387
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,860
Right.

388
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,160
I was hoping to see a shooting star once more

389
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,960
while it was still dark!

390
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,860
My prince of the stars has fled!

391
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,060
I wouldn't be surprised if he did.
