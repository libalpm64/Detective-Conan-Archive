1
00:00:02,327 --> 00:00:04,927
Ran, Sonoko and Sera,

2
00:00:04,927 --> 00:00:08,427
on their way to school runs into a certain corpse.

3
00:00:09,027 --> 00:00:09,989
What seems to be the matter?

4
00:00:10,227 --> 00:00:12,827
Well, you see, we were looking for him

5
00:00:12,827 --> 00:00:13,993
because he didn't show up at work,

6
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:15,727
we found him slumped down in a place like this.

7
00:00:15,727 --> 00:00:17,727
He's bleeding from the mouth too.

8
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:21,327
We called the ambulance while we were at it already.

9
00:00:22,527 --> 00:00:24,627
He doesn't need an ambulance.

10
00:00:24,627 --> 00:00:26,827
What?

11
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:29,127
Almost about nine hours seems to have passed

12
00:00:29,127 --> 00:00:31,427
since he died already.

13
00:00:32,927 --> 00:00:36,015
Does he have alcohol dependency?

14
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:38,017
Yeah. He used to say that the doctor

15
00:00:38,227 --> 00:00:40,027
told him to stay away from alcoholic drinks.

16
00:00:40,027 --> 00:00:42,427
But, how'd you know about it?

17
00:00:43,427 --> 00:00:45,827
He's got jaundice on the white of his eye.

18
00:00:45,827 --> 00:00:48,427
He's skinny but has a popped belly.

19
00:00:48,427 --> 00:00:50,029
This is an abdominal build of fluids!

20
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:52,031
It's proof that he's got a malfunctioning liver!

21
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:56,027
Furthermore, there is a bottle of sake left behind untouched

22
00:00:56,027 --> 00:00:58,927
in the dispenser of the vending machine.

23
00:00:58,927 --> 00:01:00,327
From the circumstances,

24
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:04,527
it's very likely that it's the bottle of sake that he bought!

25
00:01:04,527 --> 00:01:07,627
So, well, an alcoholic

26
00:01:07,627 --> 00:01:09,427
suffering from cirrhosis of the liver had a burst varix

27
00:01:09,427 --> 00:01:10,927
and spit blood.

28
00:01:10,927 --> 00:01:13,427
And since unfortunately, there was no one around at that time,

29
00:01:13,427 --> 00:01:16,527
he couldn't get help and died.

30
00:01:16,527 --> 00:01:19,227
That's what you'd normally think.

31
00:01:19,227 --> 00:01:22,061
But, this is not death by illness.

32
00:01:22,227 --> 00:01:25,027
It's a crime committed by someone with malicious intent!

33
00:01:25,027 --> 00:01:29,227
As proof of this, right in front of this man, see!

34
00:01:29,727 --> 00:01:32,527
There is the word "Death" written with blood.

35
00:01:32,527 --> 00:01:36,075
The word "Death" written in blood that was left near the corpse.

36
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:40,079
It was similar to the only case ten years ago,

37
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,427
that my Dad, Yusaku Kudo didn't specify the culprit.

38
00:01:44,427 --> 00:01:47,127
Wanting to find the similarities between the two cases,

39
00:01:47,127 --> 00:01:50,089
we called Officer Takagi who was in charge of this case.

40
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:53,027
Oh, you mean the corpse that was found this morning?

41
00:01:53,027 --> 00:01:56,727
I don't know what happened to the corpse after that though.

42
00:01:56,727 --> 00:01:58,827
It was concluded to be a robbery case,

43
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,227
and was passed over to the investigation 3rd division.

44
00:02:01,227 --> 00:02:05,627
Robbery? It wasn't a homicide?

45
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:07,027
Hey, cut out the joke!

46
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:09,727
What about that case is a robbery?

47
00:02:09,727 --> 00:02:12,111
You saw too, didn't you? That word "Death" written in blood?

48
00:02:12,111 --> 00:02:14,727
Well, I thought the same thing too.

49
00:02:14,727 --> 00:02:17,527
That this was a bizarre homicide case.

50
00:02:17,527 --> 00:02:20,127
But, Inspector Megure who came along

51
00:02:20,127 --> 00:02:22,727
after you all left for school,

52
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:24,427
saw that word written in blood

53
00:02:24,427 --> 00:02:26,827
and immediately said, 'this is probably a robbery'.

54
00:02:26,827 --> 00:02:30,927
It's not a homicide but a robbery.

55
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:33,827
It's strange, isn't it?

56
00:02:33,827 --> 00:02:35,527
I'm sure that Inspector Megure was also

57
00:02:35,527 --> 00:02:38,137
in charge of the case that occurred ten years ago.

58
00:02:38,137 --> 00:02:39,727
It's only natural that he would consider it

59
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:41,627
to be a case of serial murder, and yet...

60
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:43,827
That's true.

61
00:02:44,327 --> 00:02:47,027
Ten years ago, Inspector Megure is sure to have

62
00:02:47,027 --> 00:02:49,027
seen that word written in blood too.

63
00:02:49,027 --> 00:02:51,727
And yet... why?

64
00:02:51,727 --> 00:02:54,927
Besides, back then, Dad was talking with the boy

65
00:02:54,927 --> 00:02:56,827
who first found the corpse.

66
00:02:56,827 --> 00:02:59,427
Moreover, he was smiling too.

67
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,927
I wonder why.

68
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:06,165
I wonder why Dad declared that it was not homicide.

69
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:08,927
Why?

70
00:03:09,827 --> 00:03:11,527
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

71
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:13,327
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

72
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,027
The cold case mystery that father handled.

73
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:16,927
What is the mystery behind the common word?

74
00:03:16,927 --> 00:03:18,177
He sees through the one and only truth.

75
00:03:18,427 --> 00:03:20,527
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

76
00:03:20,527 --> 00:03:23,427
His name is Detective Conan!

77
00:05:05,254 --> 00:05:11,220
"Yusaku Kudo's Cold Case (Part 2)"

78
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,854
Don't tell me that the police know who the culprit is

79
00:05:13,854 --> 00:05:17,054
and are hiding it?

80
00:05:17,054 --> 00:05:19,954
You mean like what we see in the movies or dramas.

81
00:05:19,954 --> 00:05:21,154
Because the culprit is from

82
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,301
a distinguished family of the police force

83
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:23,354
or the political and business circles?

84
00:05:23,354 --> 00:05:26,305
That although it's frustrating, no one can lay a hand on them!

85
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:28,307
I mean you're the daughter

86
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:30,309
of the Suzuki Financial Group yourself too, aren't you?

87
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:31,454
But...

88
00:05:31,454 --> 00:05:33,754
It's hard to believe that Shinichi's father

89
00:05:33,754 --> 00:05:36,315
would pull out of a case for such a reason.

90
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:38,317
That's true.

91
00:05:38,554 --> 00:05:42,321
Then, why not ask for advice?

92
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:46,654
From your deduction loving classmate, Kinichi.

93
00:05:46,654 --> 00:05:48,054
Kinichi?

94
00:05:48,054 --> 00:05:51,454
Huh? Oh, yes. I guess so.

95
00:05:51,454 --> 00:05:53,654
Huh? Just what're you talking about?

96
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,654
If you're going to ask for advice on the case,

97
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:57,354
it would be Shinichi Kudo, right?

98
00:05:57,354 --> 00:05:58,654
He's a high school detective

99
00:05:58,654 --> 00:06:01,054
as well as your boyfriend, isn't he?

100
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:04,854
Although it seems that he's pursuing a case right now

101
00:06:04,854 --> 00:06:07,354
and isn't at home!

102
00:06:07,354 --> 00:06:12,954
Oh. So, the master of this house is that high school detective.

103
00:06:12,954 --> 00:06:15,554
Don't tell me that you were living here

104
00:06:15,554 --> 00:06:17,154
not even knowing something like that?

105
00:06:17,154 --> 00:06:21,354
No, because Ran told me that the Shinichi who lives here

106
00:06:21,354 --> 00:06:24,854
is a plain, nothing special high school student.

107
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:26,154
And, besides.

108
00:06:26,154 --> 00:06:30,154
Rumor has it that the high school detective Shinichi Kudo

109
00:06:30,154 --> 00:06:32,854
passed away when investigating a case

110
00:06:32,854 --> 00:06:34,854
and disappeared from the stage of solving mysteries,

111
00:06:34,854 --> 00:06:36,154
from what I heard.

112
00:06:36,154 --> 00:06:38,754
Is such a rumor going around?

113
00:06:38,754 --> 00:06:41,254
Yes. That's why I thought that

114
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:43,454
the person, Shinichi that pops frequently in your conversations

115
00:06:43,454 --> 00:06:44,383
was a different person.

116
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:46,754
There's no way that he's dead.

117
00:06:46,754 --> 00:06:51,054
I've been involved in two cases with him already, you know!

118
00:06:51,054 --> 00:06:54,754
Well, although it was only by phone both times.

119
00:06:54,754 --> 00:06:56,654
Right, Conan?

120
00:06:56,654 --> 00:06:59,654
Yep... right.

121
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:03,154
Then who is Kinichi?

122
00:07:03,154 --> 00:07:06,405
Oh, since Shinichi told me

123
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:09,254
to not tell you too much about himself.

124
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:12,411
I... sort of... I'm sorry.

125
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:16,954
But, I wonder why there's a rumor going around that Shinichi died?

126
00:07:16,954 --> 00:07:18,417
That's probably because

127
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:20,154
he's always telling the people involved in the case

128
00:07:20,154 --> 00:07:22,854
to keep under cover the fact that

129
00:07:22,854 --> 00:07:24,423
he's handling the case, I guess?

130
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:26,954
It seems to be that he does so

131
00:07:26,954 --> 00:07:29,654
to keep the culprits of the cases off guard.

132
00:07:30,654 --> 00:07:32,754
Does he think he's a ninja or something

133
00:07:32,754 --> 00:07:34,433
that's in hiding on enemy grounds or what?

134
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,454
Ninja?

135
00:07:36,454 --> 00:07:40,439
Then, how about calling him now?

136
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:42,754
I'd like to hear his deduction too.

137
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:46,445
Oh. But I already text mailed him at sundown

138
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:47,754
on the outline of the case.

139
00:07:47,754 --> 00:07:50,449
But, you haven't told him yet that the police

140
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:53,254
are trying to close the case as a robbery, right?

141
00:07:53,254 --> 00:07:55,054
True.

142
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:58,254
Besides, you should directly talk to him, Ran.

143
00:07:58,254 --> 00:08:00,454
-Huh? -While you're at it,

144
00:08:00,454 --> 00:08:02,954
you might well tell him how you feel about him too.

145
00:08:02,954 --> 00:08:04,754
What?

146
00:08:04,754 --> 00:08:06,854
I got to use the restroom!

147
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:09,454
Rats. No joke?

148
00:08:11,554 --> 00:08:13,954
Come on, quick.

149
00:08:15,754 --> 00:08:18,054
Oh, if you're going to call him,

150
00:08:18,054 --> 00:08:19,854
can you relay a word to him for me?

151
00:08:19,854 --> 00:08:21,754
Huh?

152
00:08:23,654 --> 00:08:25,854
Oh, Shinichi?

153
00:08:25,854 --> 00:08:28,487
It's me, Ran.

154
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:31,254
May I talk to you now?

155
00:08:31,254 --> 00:08:33,454
Yeah. What is it?

156
00:08:33,454 --> 00:08:36,495
If it's about the case you saw this morning,

157
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:39,354
the glasses boy already texted me about it.

158
00:08:39,354 --> 00:08:42,501
That the police is trying to close it as a robbery case.

159
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:43,854
Right.

160
00:08:43,854 --> 00:08:48,254
And about that other stuff that has nothing to do with the case.

161
00:08:48,254 --> 00:08:49,954
Other stuff?

162
00:08:49,954 --> 00:08:53,154
Go on and tell him that you like him.

163
00:08:53,154 --> 00:08:55,054
What is it? What other stuff?

164
00:08:55,054 --> 00:08:57,054
Oh. So... you know...

165
00:08:57,054 --> 00:09:00,254
I like you so very much. I like...

166
00:09:00,254 --> 00:09:05,154
-I super... -I like...

167
00:09:07,954 --> 00:09:09,554
Su...

168
00:09:09,554 --> 00:09:10,954
Subaru said!

169
00:09:10,954 --> 00:09:13,354
-Huh? -What?

170
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,054
Subaru said that

171
00:09:18,054 --> 00:09:22,541
you're just like a ninja! Saizo Kirigakure!

172
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:23,754
Oh, give me a break.

173
00:09:23,754 --> 00:09:26,545
He wanted me to relay this to you.

174
00:09:26,754 --> 00:09:28,854
Saizo Kirigakure?

175
00:09:28,854 --> 00:09:31,754
Oh. Is it because he's in hiding?

176
00:09:31,754 --> 00:09:33,554
Yes! Most probably.

177
00:09:33,554 --> 00:09:36,555
But, why are you talking about that at a time like this?

178
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:38,557
Saizo Kirigakure

179
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:42,254
used to be one of the Sanada Ten Braves, I think?

180
00:09:42,254 --> 00:09:44,954
If I remember correctly, legend has it that

181
00:09:44,954 --> 00:09:46,854
he was a fictitious Iga Ninja who served under warlord,

182
00:09:46,854 --> 00:09:48,567
Yukimura Sanada.

183
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:51,654
Wait a sec. Yukimura Sanada.

184
00:09:51,654 --> 00:09:54,573
Sanada maru (Sanada Barbican). Sanada himo (braid).

185
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:56,575
Sanada...

186
00:09:56,754 --> 00:09:58,577
Sanada!

187
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:01,254
I see! I got it! The truth of the case!

188
00:10:01,254 --> 00:10:03,354
-Huh? -Go right away to the crime site

189
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:04,354
you saw today!

190
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,354
What? Hey, Shinichi?

191
00:10:06,354 --> 00:10:09,954
If it's as my deduction goes, it should fit right in!

192
00:10:11,954 --> 00:10:15,654
I see. So, that's the story.

193
00:10:16,054 --> 00:10:18,597
Hey, Shinichi? What's going on?

194
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:21,154
Shinichi? Shinichi?

195
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,554
No. He hung up.

196
00:10:23,554 --> 00:10:24,603
What?

197
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:26,954
When you still haven't told him how you feel about him?

198
00:10:26,954 --> 00:10:29,454
And? What did he say, Shinichi?

199
00:10:29,454 --> 00:10:31,354
He said that he figured out the truth of the case

200
00:10:31,354 --> 00:10:33,054
so to go right over to the scene of the crime

201
00:10:33,054 --> 00:10:34,154
we went to this morning.

202
00:10:34,154 --> 00:10:36,254
He said if his deduction is correct,

203
00:10:36,254 --> 00:10:39,354
things will fit right in.

204
00:10:39,354 --> 00:10:42,621
Then, he probably figured out why his Dad

205
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:47,554
gave up on the case ten year ago too.

206
00:10:47,554 --> 00:10:50,629
He didn't give up on the case.

207
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:55,554
Shinichi said that he knew, but didn't tell anybody about it!

208
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,354
Conan?

209
00:10:57,354 --> 00:10:59,654
You talked to Shinichi?

210
00:10:59,654 --> 00:11:02,641
I was on the phone with Shinichi till just a while ago, you know?

211
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:05,154
Oh, so right after that phone call,

212
00:11:05,154 --> 00:11:06,954
really just now, I got text mail.

213
00:11:06,954 --> 00:11:09,254
Then, why didn't he tell Ran about it.

214
00:11:09,254 --> 00:11:12,054
Huh? Oh, that's because...

215
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:15,554
Conan, do you have a bow tie attached to your smart phone?

216
00:11:15,554 --> 00:11:18,254
Rats. I forgot to detach the voice changer.

217
00:11:18,254 --> 00:11:20,454
Oh, this is...

218
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:24,354
It's the "in" thing in school right now, you see.

219
00:11:25,354 --> 00:11:27,654
At any rate, if going to the crime site

220
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:30,669
is going to prove whether his deduction is right or wrong,

221
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:33,554
there's no reason why we shouldn't go there.

222
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:36,675
Don't you think so?

223
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:40,454
High school detective, Shinichi Kudo...

224
00:11:46,854 --> 00:11:50,154
After all, is saying so.

225
00:11:52,054 --> 00:11:55,054
Right. Let's go! Ran!

226
00:11:55,054 --> 00:11:56,454
Yep!

227
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:02,254
Come on, Conan, let's go!

228
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,703
You got text mail from Kudo about his deduction, right?

229
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:07,354
Oh. Yep.

230
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,723
Just as I thought, there're no police officers here at all.

231
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:27,340
No joke. I guess they concluded it as a robbery

232
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,240
and withdrew from this place all together.

233
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,240
But, normally, if somebody is found dead

234
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,440
with a word written in blood that

235
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,640
he couldn't possibly have written himself.

236
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,240
More so, if a word such as "Death" is left behind like this,

237
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,640
it's only natural they would think of it as a homicide, and yet...

238
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,740
Yep.

239
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,440
Ran, do you have your coin purse with you?

240
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,745
Huh? Yes.

241
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,240
Hey, you. Don't tell me that

242
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,740
you're planning to buy beer or something, brat?

243
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,751
No.

244
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,540
It was written in Shinichi's text mail!

245
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,340
If you do this, that is,

246
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,740
line the coins up like this on the blood word...

247
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,240
See, it fits right in, right?

248
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,840
No joke. How come?

249
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,540
This isn't a word that a person had written,

250
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,740
but blood dripped onto to the scattered coins like this,

251
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,840
and coincidentally turned out this way, he said!

252
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,779
But... what about that narrow space and all?

253
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,940
Are you saying that the blood intentionally avoided that area?

254
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,940
No. The cigarette was probably on the ground there.

255
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,540
The cigarette was smeared with blood, you know.

256
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,791
And besides, if the coin purse with the coins inside it,

257
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,440
dropped to the ground surrounding the coins then,

258
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,440
it's likely that this word "Death" would be made.

259
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:40,240
In other words...

260
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,240
The man that we found dead this morning,

261
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,640
came to buy sake here last night,

262
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,440
but because his varix burst due to cirrhosis of the liver,

263
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,940
he spit blood, and slumped down.

264
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,040
Back then on top of the coin purse, coins

265
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,240
and cigarette that he dropped,

266
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,540
blood dripped from his mouth.

267
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,240
After the man passed away,

268
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,840
a passerby took his coin purse and coins,

269
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,240
so only this word written in blood was left behind.

270
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,140
So, that's the story.

271
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,240
But, isn't there a possibility

272
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,240
that the one who took his money killed him?

273
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,540
I don't think so!

274
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,140
A blood written word like this wouldn't show up so clearly

275
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,837
unless the coin purse and money were taken

276
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,540
after the blood totally dried.

277
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,540
Then, it was a case of robbery, after all!

278
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,843
Yeah!

279
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,540
But, Conan! It's amazing how you realized it!

280
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,853
I'm not the one who realized it, it's Shinichi who did!

281
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:37,640
He said that Subaru's words rang a bell!

282
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,440
Oh, the phrase that he told me to tell Shinichi,

283
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,640
"You're like a ninja, Saizo Kirigakure."

284
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,867
Then, could this be the blood word that

285
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,240
ninjas used to use a lot?

286
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,640
No! Saizo Kirigakure was one of the Sanada Ten Braves!

287
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,540
The emblem on the banner of the Sanada family

288
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,240
are the six coins, right?

289
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,879
That's how I figured it out.

290
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,881
That this blood word was not written

291
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,885
but was made from six round coins, that created the shape.

292
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:08,140
Oh.

293
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:12,040
Of course, Shinichi told me this!

294
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,740
But, the case ten years ago was an accident, wasn't it?

295
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,240
The principal of a nursery school

296
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,640
tripped over a cobbled road in the park and fell.

297
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,840
And, the fishbowl that he was carrying at that time cracked,

298
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,540
then a shattered piece of debris

299
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,340
poked into his chest killing him.

300
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,840
Was that a case of robbery too?

301
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,911
But, in the picture of the site of the crime ten years ago,

302
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:35,440
the flowers of the park that was offered by the boy,

303
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,440
who was the first to find the corpse was shown,

304
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,640
but there was no cigarette shown.

305
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,940
Besides, Shinichi said nothing about

306
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,840
a coin purse being stolen either.

307
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,940
Then, the case ten years ago was a homicide after all?

308
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:50,340
No, that case indeed was due to the six coins!

309
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,340
Huh?

310
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,240
See, the boy called Ryosuke Nishimura

311
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,040
that was the first to find the corpse.

312
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,940
When he found the principal immobile in the park

313
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,340
lying on the ground, he thought that he was dead,

314
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,340
and therefore, put flowers and coins near the body

315
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,240
as offering!

316
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,740
The six coins were to be used to cross the Sanzu River!

317
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,949
Sanzu River?

318
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:12,940
He was only five years old kindergartener, you know?

319
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,640
But, he was the son of a monk, wasn't he?

320
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,640
It's likely that he heard about it from his parents, no?

321
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,540
That if the deceased doesn't have the six coins

322
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,961
to cross the Sanzu River,

323
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:25,640
an old lady near the river

324
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,965
will rob him of his clothes

325
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,840
and he will plunge into hell!

326
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,971
The boy who probably heard about this,

327
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:36,740
offered six coins near the corpse of the principal

328
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:41,240
and covered it with flowers so that they wouldn't be stolen.

329
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,340
But, no matter if he was the son of a temple,

330
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,985
I wonder if he'd be carrying six coins on him all the time.

331
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,340
He didn't have any,

332
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,989
so he used something that looked similar as a substitute!

333
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,640
A substitute?

334
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,740
Remember, the thing that the boy was holding in the picture?

335
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:00,999
The candy drops with a whole in the center!

336
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:04,340
Right! He used them in place of the six coins

337
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,440
and placed them near the left hand of the corpse

338
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,340
and covered them with the flowers

339
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,440
but from the space between the joints of his thumb,

340
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,340
the blood that flowed out of the corpse flow in,

341
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:17,740
and coincidentally shaped that ominous blood word!

342
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,440
That's why until the body was moved,

343
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,440
nobody noticed the word "Death" formed by blood!

344
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,240
Before the body was moved,

345
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,040
the blood word was merged with the left hand,

346
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,640
so in the picture there was no blood under the left hand,

347
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,031
but blood was found on the palm of his hand and fingers!

348
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:34,040
I see!

349
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,240
The thumb of the corpse served in place of the cigarette

350
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,340
to form a long narrow space!

351
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,740
But, there were no candy drops in the picture.

352
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,840
The dog that the boy was taking care of in the park,

353
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,840
probably took it away!

354
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,740
It also scattered the flowers too.

355
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,640
That dog in the picture wasn't wearing a collar,

356
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,840
and three candy drops were found in his dish!

357
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,340
Then why didn't Shinichi's father

358
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,340
publicize the truth of the case?

359
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,063
Because such a fuss was made over the blood word

360
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,240
being the start of bizarre serial killings.

361
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,740
Depending on how you look at it,

362
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,071
it may be mistaken for a distasteful mischief of a child.

363
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:14,740
If that were to be publicized,

364
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,440
the boy could be criticized for his act!

365
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,079
That's why I think he decided to say nothing.

366
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:23,440
Well, after seeing the blood word this time,

367
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
from the fact that Inspector Megure

368
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,640
instantly saw through what happened after seeing the round coins,

369
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,740
I'm sure that Yusaku had explained everything to him already.

370
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,240
He not only told the Inspector.

371
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,040
Back then, Dad was talking to that boy.

372
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,440
Smiling.

373
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,240
That's why back then, Dad probably...

374
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,101
Thanks to you,

375
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,240
it seems that the principal was able to go to heaven!

376
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,440
Really?

377
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,840
But, next time you make an offering,

378
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,440
I think it's better that you tell your parents about it first.

379
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,740
Okay! I understand!

380
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,140
And, don't tell anybody about what happened, okay?

381
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,040
Because we don't want anybody to find out that

382
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,540
you're the one that made the old lady by the Sanzu River get cavities

383
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,940
thanks to your candy drops, do we?

384
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,540
Said something to that affect or something.

385
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,840
Well, as for me, I was relieved to find

386
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,540
that Dad didn't pull out of the case.

387
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,540
Co...

388
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,940
Conan, right?

389
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,540
Yep.

390
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:41,140
Oh, I just happened to read Shinichi's text mail, you see.

391
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,240
Really, don't scare me like that.

392
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,640
I mean you guys already look alike too, you know!

393
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,940
I'm sorry.

394
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,840
But, too bad, don't you think?

395
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,840
We solved the case this time

396
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,540
and yet we don't know who stole the money.

397
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,840
If we need a clue,

398
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,540
I found this blood smeared 10 yen coin

399
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,640
from under this vending machine!

400
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,540
If there's blood on it, it means...

401
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:09,187
Yeah. I'm sure that when the culprit picked up the loose change,

402
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:12,340
the coin that he failed to pick up went under the vending machine,

403
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,940
but if the fingerprints on it are of someone with a record...

404
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,940
I have a record.

405
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,197
Assault and battery.

406
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:22,140
-Inflicting bodily injury. -Blackmailing.

407
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,205
We have been arrested on three previous convictions.

408
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,840
If you include robbery, that'll make four!

409
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,213
So, won't you lend us, you know what?

410
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,340
10 yen won't hurt, will it?

411
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,140
We'll give you three a good time later, so you see...

412
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,840
Okay.

413
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,440
Take this!

414
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,229
Hey?

415
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,040
Darn! What do you think you're doing?

416
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,640
Darn.

417
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,440
You brats!

418
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:16,340
How dare you guys, cut out the joke?

419
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,540
Case closed! One down!

420
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,240
That ball... Conan?

421
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,840
Yep.

422
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,340
Huh? Aren't you going to the police, Sera?

423
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,740
No. I'm sorry, but you guys go and get interrogated.

424
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,940
I've got urgent business to attend to,

425
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,940
so I've got to go.

426
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,840
Okay.

427
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,540
Hey, Conan?

428
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,140
You scraped your elbow!

429
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,391
Oh, I scraped it when I fell a while ago.

430
00:23:33,391 --> 00:23:35,393
Come on. Be careful, will you?

431
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,395
What're you going to do if it gets infected?

432
00:23:37,395 --> 00:23:40,040
Yep. I'm sorry.

433
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:51,409
I'm a bad person, after all.

434
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,024
Next Conan's Hint:

435
00:24:04,024 --> 00:24:06,122
"Surveillance Camera"

436
00:24:06,122 --> 00:24:07,425
I may lose to Sera.

437
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,874
You're stronger.

438
00:24:08,874 --> 00:24:10,560
I don't want these two to fight against each other.
