1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,670
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,270
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,570
Ran is with me in New York,

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,470
the case starts with a movie actress.

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,070
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,770
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,870
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,510
Ran?

9
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,010
Rain.

10
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,510
Do I need a reason?

11
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,610
Does God really exist?

12
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,510
Are you Japanese?

13
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,710
No angel ever smiled down on me.

14
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,210
Get lost!

15
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,510
Not even once.

16
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,610
Sharon.

17
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,210
Now I remember. It's that time...

18
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,910
when I met her.

19
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,610
I went with Shinichi.

20
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,410
I...

21
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,710
Ran!

22
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:08,210
"Shinichi In New York (Part 1)"

23
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,310
Ran.

24
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,310
Ran!

25
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,610
Ran! Hey, Ran!

26
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,510
What's the matter? Hey!

27
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,210
Ran.

28
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,910
What's wrong?

29
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,110
Ran...

30
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,210
What's wrong, kid?

31
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,510
It's Ran. She...

32
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,610
This is terrible. She's burning up.

33
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,010
Hey, call for an ambulance.

34
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,910
Yes, sir.

35
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,510
No, wait!

36
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,810
Call the hospital and tell them we're bringing a patient in.

37
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,110
But inspector, which hospital do I call?

38
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,610
The one on the other side of the Bay Bridge!

39
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,110
They have an emergency ward!

40
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,310
Yes, sir!

41
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:55,910
Oh, my. What happened to me?

42
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,110
I know a doctor at that hospital.

43
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,110
They'll give us a bed right away

44
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,610
and it won't take us 10 minutes to get there with in the police unit.

45
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,610
I got you.

46
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,110
Start the engine. We'll be there right away.

47
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,110
Yes, sir!

48
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,510
What happened?

49
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,710
Ran! Ran!

50
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,710
Hang on, Ran.

51
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,110
Ran.

52
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,110
-Ran... -Who's there?

53
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:22,810
Shinichi? Is that you, Shinichi?

54
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,610
How embarrassing.

55
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,910
He saved me again...

56
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,710
just like the last time...

57
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,810
whenever I'm feeling depressed.

58
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,410
He seems to be able to see right through me.

59
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,610
I hate to admit it but it makes me happy.

60
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,310
Shinichi.

61
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,010
Shinichi.

62
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,110
What?

63
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,410
Wait a second.

64
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,710
Isn't that...

65
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,410
The Statue of Liberty.

66
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,510
In Japan, we call it "Jiyu no Megumi".

67
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,610
I've heard that New Yorkers call her Miss Liberty, though.

68
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,310
For goodness sake. Why didn't you wake me up?

69
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,010
I was really looking forward to seeing this night view

70
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,410
of the city from the Brooklyn Bridge!

71
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,010
And look, we're almost at the end of the bridge already!

72
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,310
Listen you.

73
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,410
If you'd have slept in the plane like everybody else,

74
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,710
you wouldn't have fallen asleep like you did.

75
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,010
How could I sleep after that last case?

76
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,110
I'm not like some people

77
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,010
who can fall fast asleep after being satisfied they solved a case.

78
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:56,410
I wouldn't say I was completely satisfied.

79
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:00,710
When it comes to the reasoning and analysis of crime,

80
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,910
I don't think we can learn enough, it would take a lifetime

81
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,610
and I still wouldn't know everything there is to it, Watson.

82
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,010
What?

83
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,010
Just listen to you two,

84
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:15,110
this romantic view of the city would charm every couple in the world,

85
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,610
are you two having a lover's spat?

86
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,110
How I envy you!

87
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,910
Mom, this is all your fault, you know.

88
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:25,110
We weren't supposed to arrive in New York until tomorrow

89
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,510
but the minute we arrived in Los Angeles,

90
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,610
you made us get on the lane to New York.

91
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,310
I didn't have a choice. I wanted to see this musical

92
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,410
but I didn't think I could get the tickets, but I did.

93
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,410
What? Did you say musical?

94
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,410
Yes. See, that one.

95
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,110
"The Golden Apple"

96
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,710
"Golden Apple", I hear it's very popular now.

97
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,710
That's right. Broadway's Phantom Theater, 8 pm.

98
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,710
I'm so excited!

99
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,010
There sure seem to be a lot of police cars

100
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,510
on the road tonight, don't you think?

101
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:04,810
I guess they're after that slasher.

102
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,910
Slasher?

103
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,110
I heard the slasher's Japanese

104
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,910
and he only goes after young women.

105
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:20,910
You don't have to worry. He only appears after midnight,

106
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:25,110
you won't run into him as long as we get back to the hotel by then.

107
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,510
Besides, it isn't even 6 pm yet.

108
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,110
Don't you mean 7 pm?

109
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,110
We're on daylight savings time now.

110
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,310
What?

111
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:38,810
Oh, no! It slipped my mind completely!

112
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,110
Starting the first Sunday in April,

113
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,210
we set our clocks 1 hour ahead, don't we?

114
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,610
Oh, no!

115
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,510
Why're you so upset?

116
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:50,010
It only takes about 40 minutes to get from here to Broadway.

117
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,410
And it's still before 7 pm, we'll get there in plenty of time.

118
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,910
You don't understand,

119
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,310
I promised to meet the person who got the tickets for me.

120
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,110
I'm supposed to get to see the dressing rooms

121
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,710
if I get there 1 hour before the curtain goes up.

122
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,510
I guess you're just going to have to forget about it.

123
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,110
This so-called "English Lady" you bought

124
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,210
because you fell in love with it

125
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,110
will never get you there on time, mom.

126
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,910
Now you've done it, Shinichi.

127
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,910
Ran, grit your teeth and hang on tight.

128
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,110
Okay, sure.

129
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,810
The people at the Jaguar company put everything

130
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,410
into this E type when they built it.

131
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,410
Never underestimate me.

132
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,710
Are you sure about this?

133
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,210
This car was in the shop for repairs last month.

134
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,110
You just got it back the other day.

135
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,510
Don't worry, the mechanic was a pro, the car works like a dream.

136
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:19,510
The 267 horsepower engine won at LeMans.

137
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,910
That's enough. There're police cars all around, you know?

138
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,810
I don't care. They were in the opposite lane.

139
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,910
While they're admiring this beauty of a car,

140
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,210
we'll disappear from sight.

141
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:48,210
By the way, will you and Ran do that thing you always do?

142
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,710
It's pretty tricky up ahead, okay?

143
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,910
Please.

144
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,410
Oh, good grief...

145
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,510
Thanks.

146
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,810
I hate to ask, but Ran, can you come up here?

147
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,210
Okay. What is it?

148
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,210
Don't worry, just trust me, it's only scary in the beginning.

149
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,810
I guess so.

150
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,110
What are you doing, Shinichi?

151
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,110
Just hang on tight.

152
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,910
See, it wasn't so bad.

153
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,110
Are you crazy? How can you say that?

154
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,910
It's exactly an hour before the curtain goes up.

155
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,710
I told you. We got here right on time. No problem.

156
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,810
I guess I was wrong.

157
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,310
Your license and registration, please!

158
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,910
Okay, okay.

159
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,510
You were going 40 miles over the speed limit,

160
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,710
who do you think you are, Dirty Harry?

161
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,110
Oh, we were in a hurry.

162
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,910
You look familiar.

163
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,110
Well, your might have...

164
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:48,410
You might have met her on another case.

165
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,910
You see. She's one of us...

166
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,410
Captain!

167
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,210
She is an undercover agent.

168
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,910
It looks like the criminal got away from her this time, though.

169
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,010
Who's the old guy?

170
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,710
Radesh.

171
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,910
Yusuke met him when he solved a case.

172
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,810
That's how they became friends,

173
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,710
he's a captain on the New York police force,

174
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,910
his name's Radesh Redwood!

175
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,710
His Japanese is pretty good since his wife's from Japan.

176
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,710
Thank you, Radesh! That was embarrassing.

177
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,410
No problem,

178
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,210
it's not me you have to thank.

179
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,610
I don't understand.

180
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:36,610
If you want to thank someone, you can thank me.

181
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,310
If you want to thank someone, you can thank me.

182
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,910
Thank me, Sharon Vineyard.

183
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,910
Sharon.

184
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,610
What are you doing here?

185
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,710
The officer who was just here. He's one of my fans.

186
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,610
He and I started talking while I was waiting for you,

187
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,810
then a police bulletin came in

188
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:32,610
about a silver Jaguar heading this way travelling at a ridiculous speed

189
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:37,710
and I came up with this idea of disguising myself as Captain Redwood.

190
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,410
You should be impressed.

191
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:43,410
This man's coat was pretty expensive.

192
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,810
I am impressed

193
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:48,810
but are you sure it was okay? Everyone's looking at us.

194
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,710
Don't worry, it won't be a problem,

195
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:55,210
I told everybody we were filming a movie.

196
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,610
Oh, Sharon. I just love you!

197
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:02,110
Hey, mom. Explain things to me.

198
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,410
Who is this lady?

199
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,010
You mean you don't know, Shinichi?

200
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,110
She's a famous American actress!

201
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,310
Like I was saying,

202
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,010
how can a famous actress like her

203
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,710
disguise herself so well that nobody recognizes her?

204
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,810
Didn't I ever tell you the story?

205
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,510
When I was just starting out as an actress,

206
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,610
I got a role as a spy.

207
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,210
And to get into character,

208
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,410
I signed up to study under a famous magician

209
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,110
to learn how to disguise myself.

210
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:36,910
Sharon was also there since she had gotten a similar role,

211
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,910
that's how we became friends.

212
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,410
Only thing is, I never got to be as good as her

213
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:45,310
she can disguise herself perfectly.

214
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,610
Yeah, you were always fooling around

215
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,910
but you seemed to be playing dress-up,

216
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,010
instead of disguising yourself.

217
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,810
Sorry, I wasn't good enough for you.

218
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,710
But I was doing my best.

219
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,710
I'm so thrilled!

220
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:07,710
I got to meet such a famous person and in New York, no less.

221
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,710
I've got to thank God for this.

222
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,810
Does God really exist?

223
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:33,010
If God does actually exist,

224
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,410
then all the people who are striving to survive

225
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,710
should be rewarded with happiness, isn't that right?

226
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,910
Yes, at the very least.

227
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:46,310
No angel ever smiled down on me,

228
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,010
not even once.

229
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,510
The sadness in her smile

230
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:00,510
might have been a premonition of things to come

231
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,110
of the tragedy that would soon follow.

232
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:09,910
I didn't want to remember that awful incident.

233
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,410
What do you mean by that?

234
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,210
About no angel ever smiling on you.

235
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,810
She's trying to say she's had a hard time.

236
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,310
Isn't that right, Sharon?

237
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,610
That's right.

238
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,710
My life's been one hardship after the other.

239
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,910
I struggled to become an actress

240
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,510
and on the day my debut film was to be shown

241
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,810
my parents died in a fire.

242
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,510
Then the day after I received the Oscar,

243
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,310
my husband died from an illness.

244
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,410
Then there's Crystal who made her debut so easily

245
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,310
just because she was my daughter,

246
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,110
everything was handed to her on a silver plate,

247
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,410
what a difference between us.

248
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,510
Don't exaggerate.

249
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,510
I know you're proud of her, you put everything into raising her.

250
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:59,010
That child, I don't consider her my daughter anymore.

251
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,010
What?

252
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,510
I don't know if you can believe this.

253
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,810
But she stood behind me

254
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,210
while I was putting flowers on my husband's grave

255
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:09,910
and she had disguised herself to look exactly like him.

256
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,610
Don't you think it was rather sick to be considered a joke?

257
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:17,210
I just remembered what you once told me

258
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,810
you said you taught her how to disguise herself

259
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,510
because she begged you so much.

260
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,310
I haven't spoken to her since.

261
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,110
It's been almost 10 years

262
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,810
and it seemed like she was hanging around some shady characters.

263
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:33,410
Enough about that, go park your car in the parking lot,

264
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,510
let's head for the dressing rooms.

265
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:41,010
I think those people have started to realize there are no cameras around.

266
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:46,710
But why did you want us here an hour before the show starts?

267
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,810
We'd be less of a bother for everybody if we came earlier

268
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:53,810
and we'd have had more time to talk to the performers.

269
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,810
Don't be silly, if we came here earlier

270
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,310
the performers would still be just regular people,

271
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,210
but seeing them just before the show starts.

272
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,910
"Lila Sanchez (32)" -Sharon is here.

273
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,210
You came to see us, after all!

274
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:19,410
"Akane Nirusen (27)" -I guess our coach does tell the truth sometimes.

275
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,310
"Rose Huide (28)" -How exciting! I'm so happy!

276
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,910
This is like a dream!

277
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,410
I'm suprised you had time!

278
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,010
-Are you free today? -Let's go eat later!

279
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,010
Now I get it.

280
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,410
When we see them just before the show,

281
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:32,710
they're already in makeup and they're actresses.

282
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,710
They all adore her, don't they?

283
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,610
Yes, they do. She knows their troupe leader very well,

284
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,610
when she said she wanted to come and give them her support

285
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:47,710
she was handed to the tickets, just like that.

286
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,410
Is that who I think it is?

287
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,210
It sure is.

288
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:56,510
The people's favorite female private detective.

289
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,310
Night Baroness...

290
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,110
At your service!

291
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,910
Night Baroness?

292
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,610
That's what she's called back here.

293
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,410
Because she's married to Yusuke Kudo,

294
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,510
the author of the book "Night Baron".

295
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:15,610
And being married to a mystery writer, mom once appeared

296
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:19,410
as a guest on a special investigative program on television here.

297
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:23,610
She analyzed a crime and everything she said fit,

298
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:26,610
the criminal was arrested right away.

299
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:31,210
That's how she became so popular and they nicknamed her Night Baroness.

300
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:38,710
But no one knew she was only repeating what dad mumbled

301
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,010
while he read the newspaper every morning.

302
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,310
You mean those two are your children?

303
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,810
He is, but she isn't.

304
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:55,110
Maybe she'll become family in the future, though.

305
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,910
How wonderful!

306
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,510
She's so lucky!

307
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,810
Well, well.

308
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:07,610
I thought the Night Baroness was here

309
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,710
to solve the mystery of the strange parcel.

310
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,910
But I see she's only come to gossip

311
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,710
and she's even brought her kids with her.

312
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,810
"Everess Hamilton (30)" -I'm so disappointed.

313
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,610
Strange parcel?

314
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,910
That's right.

315
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,910
A package was sent to the troupe 3 days ago.

316
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:28,410
It was an apple sprayed with a golden coating,

317
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,710
golden apple.

318
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:34,710
There was a message inside, it was written in animal blood and said,

319
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,410
"To the most beautiful woman".

320
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,210
I see.

321
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,210
So that explains the ominous feeling I got

322
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,910
when I walked into this dressing room.

323
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:49,110
"Heath Flockhart (33)" -Just calm down, my lovelies.

324
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,810
I'm sure it was just somebody's idea of a joke.

325
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,610
But, Heath...

326
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,810
Who's that?

327
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:59,910
That's Heath Flockhart, the star of this theatrical group.

328
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,110
But tonight is his last performance

329
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,110
because he got a role to star in a movie.

330
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,410
Okay, everybody cheer up.

331
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,410
Let's all give Sharon and her friends the backstage tour.

332
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,410
Are you sure it's all right?

333
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,410
The show starts in 40 minutes,

334
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,810
maybe we shouldn't be bothering them.

335
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,110
Don't worry about it.

336
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:30,510
The first 20 minutes will be a narration,

337
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:33,610
a narrator will just go on and on about Greek mythology.

338
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,410
What's that up there?

339
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,110
Oh, that. They're stage costumes.

340
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:44,010
They have it suspended up there, so it doesn't get in the way.

341
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,410
Look out!

342
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,810
Armor!

343
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,010
Ran!

344
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,210
Ran!

345
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,300
Next Conan's Hint:

346
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,400
"Feathers"

347
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,120
I'm going to rack my brains on this one.

348
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,580
If you don't solve it by the next episode,

349
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,220
you're going to get smaller.
