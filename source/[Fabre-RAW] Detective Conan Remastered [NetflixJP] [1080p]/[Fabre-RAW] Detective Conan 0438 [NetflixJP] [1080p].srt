1
00:00:15,745 --> 00:00:17,245
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:17,245 --> 00:00:19,045
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:20,545
Today, is the usual viewing things from a different angle.

4
00:00:20,545 --> 00:00:23,445
Find the boy from the e-mails, that are randomly received.

5
00:00:23,445 --> 00:00:24,945
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:26,745
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:26,745 --> 00:00:29,045
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,567 --> 00:02:02,467
Disasters at sea due to tsunamis, forest fires

9
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:06,767
due to abnormally dry weather, and frequent earthquakes...

10
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:09,767
Maybe a large meteor or something's going to come falling down.

11
00:02:09,767 --> 00:02:12,567
Really, Earth really seems to be in trouble!

12
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:15,867
Well, even I, the great detective Kogoro Mouri,

13
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:18,467
when it comes to natural disasters, my hands are tied.

14
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:20,167
Well, the way you usually carry yourself around,

15
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:22,567
you probably wouldn't even be able to stop a child's quarrel.

16
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:26,967
Thank you, Azusa.

17
00:02:26,967 --> 00:02:29,367
Today is time off with the family day?

18
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:30,567
No.

19
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,567
After this, I'm going to check on the neighborhood pachinko parlor

20
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:36,467
to see how well the balls come out.

21
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:39,067
Then, in the evening, I'm going to a drinking party

22
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:40,667
held by the community committee.

23
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:43,367
And at night, I'm going to play mahjong.

24
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:45,467
I'm really busy, you see!

25
00:02:45,467 --> 00:02:47,067
I see.

26
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:52,667
Oh, it's nothing, please just ignore me.

27
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:55,367
Azusa, is something wrong?

28
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:59,167
Can you tell? That something is bothering me?

29
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:01,467
I mean, you're being so obvious about it.

30
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:03,267
What's troubling you?

31
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,767
Well, you see...

32
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,667
It's this...

33
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:15,667
"Pursue the Fish Mail"

34
00:03:16,267 --> 00:03:17,267
Cell phone?

35
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:22,267
Don't tell me that a customer forgot something in this shop again and...

36
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:25,067
Oh, no, this is mine!

37
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:29,267
Oh then, is it a mysterious crank mail or something?

38
00:03:29,267 --> 00:03:33,967
Well, it is a mail all right, but it's not crank mail.

39
00:03:33,967 --> 00:03:38,267
The one sending it is a 5 years old boy, named Mitsuru Osabe.

40
00:03:38,267 --> 00:03:39,667
A child...

41
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:43,767
I think it's been for these past two or three months.

42
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:47,867
Welcome!

43
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:52,467
He comes here often with his father.

44
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:54,067
Hello, Azusa.

45
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:57,767
It seems that his mother has gone back to her parental home

46
00:03:57,767 --> 00:03:59,567
and hasn't returned yet.

47
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:03,367
So, since then, he's been mailing me a lot from his father's cell phone.

48
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:05,667
He writes things like, "I ate up all the cucumber."

49
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:07,767
"I took a bath all by myself."

50
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:09,167
You know, daily routine things.

51
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:11,967
He sends me mail about trivial things on a daily basis.

52
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,367
Then, why don't you tell his father

53
00:04:17,367 --> 00:04:19,967
to tell the boy to stop sending you mail?

54
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:23,267
Oh, I'm not bothered by his mails at all.

55
00:04:23,267 --> 00:04:25,967
It's just that he sent me four mails already today.

56
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:27,367
Four mails?

57
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,967
Yes, and the contents bothers me.

58
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:32,167
The first mail says,

59
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:36,367
"Hi, Azusa. I'm out today with daddy."

60
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:38,367
"He bought me a chair and cap."

61
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:41,267
"Everybody's wearing caps, so I guess I'll wear mine too."

62
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:42,467
The second mail says,

63
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:44,267
"I'm drenching with sweat and feel crummy"

64
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:46,467
"so I'm taking off my shoes."

65
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:49,867
I wonder if he's doing something that making him sweat profusely.

66
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:53,067
"I'm hungry. I'm looking at the sign of a restaurant."

67
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:56,267
"I want to eat hamburger that you serve at your shop."

68
00:04:56,267 --> 00:04:57,867
The third mail says,

69
00:04:57,867 --> 00:04:59,567
"A man wearing black glasses"

70
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:01,967
"and a woman in blue clothes are looking this way,"

71
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:03,067
"but I'm not scared."

72
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:04,967
"I'm not going to cry."

73
00:05:04,967 --> 00:05:06,767
Crying?

74
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:09,067
I wonder if he's going through something frightening right now.

75
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:10,467
I don't know.

76
00:05:10,467 --> 00:05:12,067
And his fourth mail says,

77
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:15,767
"Die like a fish caught in fishing net."

78
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:18,067
Die?

79
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:21,367
And did you send him mail, Azusa?

80
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:22,967
Yes.

81
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:26,167
Like, "Where are you?" and "What are you doing?"

82
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:30,067
But I've got no replies to my questions.

83
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:32,667
Maybe he doesn't know how to receive mail.

84
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:35,867
He can send mail, but can't receive?

85
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:43,167
Right. It seems that he was taught how to send mail to me before,

86
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:45,667
but as far as receiving mail, his father seems to do it for him.

87
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:48,767
I guess he wasn't taught how to open mail

88
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:51,667
in order to prevent receiving spam mails.

89
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:56,667
Which means his father is not near him?

90
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:03,467
Come to think of it, his second mail mentioned him being hungry.

91
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:05,767
Maybe he's been left alone for quite some time.

92
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:07,467
What time did that mail come?

93
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:10,067
Yes, let's see, the first mail came...

94
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:11,867
At 9.07am.

95
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:14,467
The second one at 10.16am,

96
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:17,467
and the third one at 11.54am.

97
00:06:17,467 --> 00:06:21,467
The fourth one came in just a while ago, at 3.02 in the afternoon.

98
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:24,967
The time span between the mails is getting longer each time.

99
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:27,767
Maybe Mitsuru's getting tired?

100
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:33,167
Really, what the heck is the father doing leaving his son alone?

101
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,567
I don't know about the father,

102
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:38,767
but I think Mitsuru is out fishing.

103
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:44,267
You idiot! I'll bet you're saying that

104
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:46,467
because the boy wrote fish caught in a net.

105
00:06:46,467 --> 00:06:48,467
But people don't usual fish,

106
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:51,067
near fishermen are out fishing with their nets!

107
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:55,667
I think so too, but the first and second mail refer to fishing!

108
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:58,067
It seems that Mitsuru as well as the people around him

109
00:06:58,067 --> 00:07:00,067
are all wearing hats.

110
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:02,067
And besides, he mentioned that his feet were drenched with sweat.

111
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:04,267
Children don't usually wear boots,

112
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:06,867
so he's probably wearing rubber boots.

113
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:10,867
Wearing a cap, boots and sitting on a chair is?

114
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:16,067
But, if so, the people who are there fishing...

115
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:17,367
That's right.

116
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:21,667
Would not leave a child who is alone for such a long time unattended.

117
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:23,367
Oh, that's probably because...

118
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:25,067
What is it, Conan?

119
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:26,167
What?

120
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:28,667
Everybody's absorbed in fishing and...

121
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:31,567
Well, nobody noticed him.

122
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:35,067
That's why we think it's strange.

123
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:40,067
Maybe that boy has a sore neck?

124
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:42,567
What? What're you talking about?

125
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:48,567
Because the first mail says, "everybody around him is wearing hats".

126
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:51,067
The second one says, "the sign of the restaurant".

127
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:54,867
And the third one says, "a man wearing sunglasses"

128
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:56,767
"and a woman in blue clothes".

129
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,267
It seems he's only looking upwards.

130
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:01,967
If you were a small child, you would understand too, Pops.

131
00:08:01,967 --> 00:08:04,667
It's kind of hard, you know.

132
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:08,167
You're talking like you turned from an adult into a child.

133
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:11,167
I... I was just stating an example.

134
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:16,667
Hey, maybe that boy's in a car.

135
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,267
A car?

136
00:08:18,267 --> 00:08:21,467
I mean, maybe it's not that he's looking up,

137
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,567
but rather, he cannot see what's below him.

138
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:25,667
Oh, inside a car...

139
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:27,867
If he is sitting in the seat and writing mail,

140
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:29,867
from the hip down of the people that go by

141
00:08:29,867 --> 00:08:31,767
is hidden from his view by the door.

142
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:35,467
So maybe the third mail he sent about somebody looking towards him,

143
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:37,467
was probably one of the people who came to fish

144
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:39,467
that was worried about him sitting alone in the car.

145
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:42,267
It's not that easy calling out to a child inside a car.

146
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:43,567
I see.

147
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:45,467
After they arrived at the fishing spot,

148
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:48,267
his father for some reason disappeared.

149
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:50,667
Having to wait for a long time inside the car,

150
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:54,167
the boy got bored and decided to send mail to Azusa,

151
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,667
but eventually got tired.

152
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:59,267
But, what could've happened to his father?

153
00:08:59,267 --> 00:09:02,167
I wonder if he's not coming back.

154
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:04,967
It's this!

155
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:08,867
But this is yesterday's...

156
00:09:08,867 --> 00:09:10,867
"4 Anglers Currently Missing" -If the sea is rough,

157
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:13,067
the same thing could've happened!

158
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:16,867
And, did you call? Did you call that boy?

159
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:18,467
Yes, I tried.

160
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:21,167
But, no matter how many times I try, it won't connect!

161
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:23,667
I wonder if he's somewhere outside the service range.

162
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:26,867
Maybe he was told by his father to switch the phone off

163
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,867
after he sends mail out.

164
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:30,867
To save on power.

165
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:33,867
Hey, have you ever heard of a fishing spot

166
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:36,067
that the father and son go to a lot, Azusa?

167
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:38,267
No. Not really...

168
00:09:38,267 --> 00:09:40,867
Oh, but...

169
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:43,667
One day, they were looking through a leisure magazine we have here,

170
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,167
and his father was saying, let's go here.

171
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:48,267
I'm sure he dog-eared it.

172
00:09:48,267 --> 00:09:49,467
Show it to me, quickly!

173
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:51,667
Yes! I'll bring it right away.

174
00:09:53,867 --> 00:09:56,767
Bad, six hours have already gone by.

175
00:09:56,767 --> 00:09:58,867
I wonder what in the world happened.

176
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:02,267
I don't understand the fourth mail though.

177
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:05,867
Die like a fish caught in fishing net?

178
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:07,667
I wonder if people who are there fishing will walk around

179
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,767
with fish in their nets?

180
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:12,867
No, they'll most probably put the fish inside a cooler box.

181
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:16,967
If so, I wonder why Mitsuru would use that expression?

182
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:18,967
What?

183
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:21,167
There are three pages that are dog-eared?

184
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:23,867
Yes, I'm sure it's this magazine, but...

185
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:27,367
There are other customers who also dog-ear pages occasionally.

186
00:10:28,967 --> 00:10:31,567
The first is Nakaarai.

187
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:33,767
The second is Kusarazu.

188
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:36,867
And the third is Komaezaki.

189
00:10:36,867 --> 00:10:39,167
They're all so far from one another.

190
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:42,667
Oh, it's says "Recommended Inns" here.

191
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:46,267
Today is Saturday, so maybe they were planning to spend a night there.

192
00:10:46,267 --> 00:10:49,967
"Nakaarai" -There is no reservation for such a person.

193
00:10:49,967 --> 00:10:51,367
I see. By the way,

194
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:53,267
are there many people who have come fishing today?

195
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:55,667
Yes, although there is some wind,

196
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:57,767
it's slightly cloudy and great for fishing.

197
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:59,567
Wind? Maybe the tides are high

198
00:10:59,567 --> 00:11:01,367
and one of your fishing guests was taken away by the waves?

199
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:04,167
Oh, what an unpleasant thing to say.

200
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:06,367
If this is a crank call, please cut it out.

201
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:12,367
"Kusarazu" -Let's see... Mr. Osabe, Mr. Osabe?

202
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:14,367
There's no one by that name here.

203
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:16,967
What? The weather?

204
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:20,367
It's raining, but it's easier to catch fish in this weather

205
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:22,067
so there are quite a few people here.

206
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:25,267
With the rain and all, has there been any accidents or such?

207
00:11:27,267 --> 00:11:29,267
No.

208
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:31,967
It's drizzling off and on and there's no wind either.

209
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,167
"Komaezaki" -Osabe? Nope, no such guest!

210
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:38,867
Is something the matter? You sound angry.

211
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:40,667
Yeah, the guests are bugging me saying

212
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,467
that they can't catch even one fish!

213
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:43,967
In this sunny weather,

214
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:45,667
in a fishing spot of shallow water like ours,

215
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:47,867
it's easy to tell that the baits are on fishing poles.

216
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:50,667
There's no wind and the poles are easy to use.

217
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:51,667
If they want to fish that badly,

218
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:54,267
they should improve their fishing skills, right?

219
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:56,067
Very... very true.

220
00:11:57,867 --> 00:11:58,967
How was it?

221
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:07,567
No, it... it's mail from Mitsuru!

222
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:09,767
Call him right away.

223
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:11,967
I'm sure you'll be able to connect if you do so right now.

224
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:12,967
Yes.

225
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:18,167
The cell phone is presently out of the service area

226
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:19,567
-Oh, no good. -or switched off...

227
00:12:19,567 --> 00:12:20,867
Oh, no.

228
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:22,667
And, what does the mail say?

229
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,467
Yes. Let's see.

230
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:28,267
"I thought there was only one fish but there are three."

231
00:12:28,267 --> 00:12:30,367
"How lucky the fish are."

232
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:31,867
What that supposed to mean?

233
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:33,367
I don't know.

234
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:35,667
I though there was only one fish...

235
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:40,567
I see, so there are three fish.

236
00:12:56,794 --> 00:12:57,794
Mommy.

237
00:13:05,094 --> 00:13:06,594
Mommy.

238
00:13:06,594 --> 00:13:08,894
Why'd you leave?

239
00:13:08,894 --> 00:13:10,694
When are you coming back?

240
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:17,894
I wonder if daddy left me and went some place too.

241
00:13:17,894 --> 00:13:21,094
I've been waiting so long and he still hasn't come back.

242
00:13:21,094 --> 00:13:23,394
How lucky the fish are.

243
00:13:28,894 --> 00:13:30,894
How lucky the fish are.

244
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,894
I don't have the slightest idea.

245
00:13:32,894 --> 00:13:35,394
The only thing we know is that this boy

246
00:13:35,394 --> 00:13:38,594
is probably at one of the fishing spots of three.

247
00:13:38,594 --> 00:13:41,094
Nakaarai, where there is wind, but great for fishing

248
00:13:41,094 --> 00:13:42,794
because it is cloudy.

249
00:13:42,794 --> 00:13:45,694
Kusarazu, where it is drizzling but has no wind

250
00:13:45,694 --> 00:13:49,994
and the third, Komaezaki, where it is sunny with no wind.

251
00:13:49,994 --> 00:13:52,994
Maybe it's Nakaarai because many fish are being caught, right?

252
00:13:52,994 --> 00:13:55,294
No, but Kusarazu seems to be the same too.

253
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:57,294
The only place that is doing bad is Komaezaki.

254
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,894
But Mitsuru dog-eared the page

255
00:13:59,894 --> 00:14:02,594
and decided on where to go just last week.

256
00:14:02,594 --> 00:14:04,094
So as to the weather...

257
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:06,494
There's no connection.

258
00:14:06,494 --> 00:14:08,794
Hey, about the no wind thing.

259
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:11,294
Is there a day when the wind doesn't blow at all?

260
00:14:11,294 --> 00:14:12,494
What?

261
00:14:12,494 --> 00:14:15,794
Well, if it's a clear day and the temperature rises...

262
00:14:15,794 --> 00:14:17,694
Come to think of it, the guy on the phone,

263
00:14:17,694 --> 00:14:19,894
just before hanging up said...

264
00:14:19,894 --> 00:14:23,094
There's no wind and the fishing pole is easy to use.

265
00:14:23,094 --> 00:14:26,294
Oh, now the wind's started to blow.

266
00:14:27,594 --> 00:14:30,794
Hey, if Mitsuru is in the car,

267
00:14:30,794 --> 00:14:33,894
and is looking up all the time...

268
00:14:33,894 --> 00:14:36,394
Maybe he was daydreaming?

269
00:14:36,394 --> 00:14:39,794
-What? -Because a fish can't swim above,

270
00:14:39,794 --> 00:14:42,494
I mean it can't swim through the sky, can it?

271
00:14:42,494 --> 00:14:45,294
What? A fish fly through the sky?

272
00:14:45,294 --> 00:14:48,094
It doesn't say anything like that in his mail at all!

273
00:14:48,094 --> 00:14:52,594
Look, it says, "I thought there was one fish, but there are three".

274
00:14:52,594 --> 00:14:53,794
"I thought there was only one fish but there are three"

275
00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:54,994
"How lucky the fish are."

276
00:14:56,094 --> 00:14:58,094
Well, I guess so but...

277
00:14:58,094 --> 00:15:00,694
If he's looking at that and thinking, "How lucky"...

278
00:15:00,694 --> 00:15:04,194
Wouldn't it mean the three fish are swimming together?

279
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,094
Come to think of it, Mitsuru seemed lonesome

280
00:15:06,094 --> 00:15:08,094
that his mother went back to her parental home,

281
00:15:08,094 --> 00:15:10,094
and hasn't come back for quite a while.

282
00:15:10,094 --> 00:15:14,394
Maybe he wanted to change places with the fish.

283
00:15:14,394 --> 00:15:18,694
But, there are no fish in this world that swim in the sky.

284
00:15:18,694 --> 00:15:20,894
Then, maybe he went to see that kind of a strange movie

285
00:15:20,894 --> 00:15:23,394
with his father or something?

286
00:15:23,394 --> 00:15:26,594
Because it was Children's Day just a while ago.

287
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:28,994
What? Children's Day?

288
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,394
May 5th...

289
00:15:31,394 --> 00:15:33,894
Children's Day which means...

290
00:15:37,294 --> 00:15:39,394
Ko... Koinobori!(Carp streamer)

291
00:15:40,794 --> 00:15:44,794
Maybe Mitsuru could see Koinobori from where he is.

292
00:15:44,794 --> 00:15:48,894
Koinobori are slack when there is no wind and look dead, don't they?

293
00:15:48,894 --> 00:15:51,194
Which means he's at Kusarazu where there's no wind!

294
00:15:51,194 --> 00:15:55,494
No, he says "I thought there was only one but there are three".

295
00:15:55,494 --> 00:15:58,594
Which means there was no wind, but it began to blow.

296
00:15:58,594 --> 00:16:01,694
Komaezaki, that's where we go!

297
00:16:06,294 --> 00:16:07,694
Daddy.

298
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,294
Daddy.

299
00:16:12,994 --> 00:16:14,794
I feel strange.

300
00:16:14,794 --> 00:16:17,894
It's hot and I feel sick.

301
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,194
Daddy.

302
00:16:22,494 --> 00:16:24,894
What? Heatstroke?

303
00:16:24,894 --> 00:16:25,894
You mean Mitsuru?

304
00:16:25,894 --> 00:16:30,694
Yeah, if he is locked up in a car for six hours under the hot sun,

305
00:16:30,694 --> 00:16:32,694
it's very likely.

306
00:16:32,694 --> 00:16:34,894
He may already be dehydrated by now.

307
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:38,594
By the way, Ran, did you contact the Komaezaki police?

308
00:16:38,594 --> 00:16:40,594
Yes, but they say there are a lot of fishing spots

309
00:16:40,594 --> 00:16:42,794
and it may be difficult to find him.

310
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:45,194
What shall I do? It's all my fault.

311
00:16:45,194 --> 00:16:48,894
If only... if only I had told Mr. Mouri about it earlier...

312
00:16:48,894 --> 00:16:50,694
Don't worry, we'll find him.

313
00:16:50,694 --> 00:16:52,194
What?

314
00:16:52,194 --> 00:16:56,294
Besides, it may be easier to find him when the sun sets.

315
00:16:57,794 --> 00:17:01,094
Over here, we can see an overview of the town.

316
00:17:01,094 --> 00:17:05,794
The thing to look for is the Koinobori, three of them.

317
00:17:05,794 --> 00:17:07,294
Although Children's Day already passed,

318
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:09,194
there are still a lot of them left.

319
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,194
After all, it's the scenery and custom of this season.

320
00:17:11,194 --> 00:17:14,294
It's going to be tough trying to single one out.

321
00:17:16,694 --> 00:17:19,494
Wow! I found a really big net.

322
00:17:19,494 --> 00:17:21,994
With that net, we can even catch a whale.

323
00:17:21,994 --> 00:17:22,994
See, over there!

324
00:17:22,994 --> 00:17:26,694
Idiot, that's a golf practice course.

325
00:17:26,694 --> 00:17:29,794
It's surrounded by a big net so that the balls don't go flying outside.

326
00:17:29,794 --> 00:17:32,994
So, it's not used for catching whales.

327
00:17:35,094 --> 00:17:36,394
Don't tell me that...

328
00:17:36,394 --> 00:17:41,094
Mitsuru saw the net and the Koinobori overlay each other and...

329
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:43,094
That's why he wrote that mail.

330
00:17:43,094 --> 00:17:47,694
I see, a golf practice course with Koinobori nearby.

331
00:17:47,694 --> 00:17:49,894
Where? Where? Where is it?

332
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:50,994
Oh!

333
00:17:52,494 --> 00:17:54,294
There it is, over there!

334
00:17:54,294 --> 00:17:56,694
"Parking Lot"

335
00:17:59,994 --> 00:18:01,594
Mitsuru!

336
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:03,094
Where are you?

337
00:18:03,094 --> 00:18:04,994
Please answer me!

338
00:18:04,994 --> 00:18:06,794
This is the only parking lot where the two look

339
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,994
one on top of the other.

340
00:18:08,994 --> 00:18:11,794
But it sure is a large place.

341
00:18:11,794 --> 00:18:13,594
I'm sure he's some place there, though,

342
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:15,294
so check the inside of the cars carefully and look for him!

343
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,894
Okay.

344
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:20,494
Mitsuru! Mitsuru!

345
00:18:21,394 --> 00:18:23,894
Come to think of it, it said in his mail.

346
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:27,294
The place where the golf practice course and the Koinobori overlap

347
00:18:27,294 --> 00:18:29,494
as well as the place where he can see the sign of the restaurant.

348
00:18:45,894 --> 00:18:48,794
I found him! Mitsuru is over here!

349
00:18:50,594 --> 00:18:52,694
No good, the door is locked. It won't open!

350
00:18:52,694 --> 00:18:55,294
Mitsuru, Mitsuru!

351
00:18:55,294 --> 00:18:56,494
Stand back.

352
00:18:58,694 --> 00:19:00,194
Azusa from Poirot!

353
00:19:01,294 --> 00:19:02,994
Mitsuru!

354
00:19:02,994 --> 00:19:06,394
Azusa, why? What's the matter?

355
00:19:06,394 --> 00:19:07,694
Hurry, open the door!

356
00:19:07,694 --> 00:19:11,394
But Daddy said to stay in the car.

357
00:19:11,394 --> 00:19:15,494
It's okay. Please listen to me!

358
00:19:15,494 --> 00:19:16,494
Oh.

359
00:19:16,494 --> 00:19:17,594
Okay.

360
00:19:19,794 --> 00:19:21,194
Mitsuru!

361
00:19:23,794 --> 00:19:26,694
It sure feels good outside, after all.

362
00:19:26,694 --> 00:19:29,194
Well, he looks to be...

363
00:19:29,194 --> 00:19:30,794
Fine.

364
00:19:33,894 --> 00:19:34,894
They're supposed to be fishing out at sea

365
00:19:34,894 --> 00:19:36,994
and yet these poles are for river fishing...

366
00:19:36,994 --> 00:19:38,994
There's no cooler box in sight too.

367
00:19:38,994 --> 00:19:40,594
Why?

368
00:19:40,594 --> 00:19:45,194
I wonder if Mitsuru's father came here for another reason.

369
00:19:45,194 --> 00:19:48,494
I wonder what happened to that guy.

370
00:19:48,494 --> 00:19:51,494
Oh, you mean that guy that got messed up in the fight.

371
00:19:51,494 --> 00:19:55,594
Hey, the guy that got messed up in a fight, where'd he go?

372
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,094
Who the heck are you?

373
00:19:57,094 --> 00:19:58,694
Never mind, just tell me!

374
00:19:58,694 --> 00:20:01,994
I don't know. He seems to have been bleeding from the head, though.

375
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:05,194
I heard the ambulance so he was probably taken to the hospital.

376
00:20:05,194 --> 00:20:07,294
Hospital?

377
00:20:08,194 --> 00:20:10,494
Hey, Mitsuru!

378
00:20:11,494 --> 00:20:13,594
-Daddy! -Mitsuru!

379
00:20:14,294 --> 00:20:16,394
I'm glad, you're okay!

380
00:20:16,394 --> 00:20:18,094
Where were you?

381
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:22,094
I was all by myself until Azusa and the others came to get me!

382
00:20:22,094 --> 00:20:24,094
Oh, I'm sorry.

383
00:20:24,094 --> 00:20:26,094
Oh, you're the one working at Poirot.

384
00:20:26,094 --> 00:20:28,894
Yes, I read the mails from Mitsuru,

385
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,194
and had Mr. Mouri and the others come with me to check on him.

386
00:20:32,194 --> 00:20:33,694
Hello.

387
00:20:33,694 --> 00:20:36,994
Oh, thank you so very much.

388
00:20:36,994 --> 00:20:38,494
The thing is...

389
00:20:38,494 --> 00:20:40,994
What? You jerk!

390
00:20:40,994 --> 00:20:41,994
You wanna fight?

391
00:20:41,994 --> 00:20:44,494
Hey, stop it! Cut it out, you guys!

392
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:47,894
-You jerk! -Shut up!

393
00:20:47,894 --> 00:20:49,194
Gosh!

394
00:20:49,194 --> 00:20:50,594
Ouch.

395
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:58,694
I passed out and was at the hospital till a while ago.

396
00:20:58,694 --> 00:21:00,694
But, Mitsuru,

397
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:03,994
I have a really big present in place for making you wait so long.

398
00:21:12,894 --> 00:21:15,994
Mommy! Mommy!

399
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,994
Mommy!

400
00:21:19,994 --> 00:21:22,594
I'm home, Mitsuru.

401
00:21:22,594 --> 00:21:25,994
I see, his mother looks like you, Azusa.

402
00:21:26,794 --> 00:21:28,494
Is that why he mailed me?

403
00:21:29,894 --> 00:21:33,794
Your wife was hospitalized three months because of tuberculosis?

404
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:36,894
Yes, we didn't want to worry Mitsuru

405
00:21:36,894 --> 00:21:38,894
so we told him that she went back to grandma's place.

406
00:21:38,894 --> 00:21:42,494
They don't really allow visitors either when you have T.B. so...

407
00:21:42,494 --> 00:21:46,094
The physical exam for whether she could be discharged or not was today.

408
00:21:46,094 --> 00:21:48,394
Since I wanted Mitsuru to be able to see her as soon as possible,

409
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:51,494
I brought him along saying let's go fishing.

410
00:21:51,494 --> 00:21:53,694
But, I was surprised out of my wits.

411
00:21:53,694 --> 00:21:58,794
When I came to, my wife was worriedly watching over me instead.

412
00:21:58,794 --> 00:22:01,294
And what about the result of the exam?

413
00:22:01,294 --> 00:22:02,494
Of course.

414
00:22:02,494 --> 00:22:04,294
I won't go anywhere anymore.

415
00:22:04,294 --> 00:22:06,094
We'll stay together forever.

416
00:22:06,094 --> 00:22:07,094
Really?

417
00:22:07,094 --> 00:22:08,594
All right!

418
00:22:10,494 --> 00:22:13,794
I'm glad, all three got together fine.

419
00:23:52,894 --> 00:23:55,794
I wish all three of us can get together again soon too.

420
00:23:57,794 --> 00:24:00,794
I guess I'll just kind of tag along then.

421
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,700
Next Conan's Hint:

422
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,400
"Novel"

423
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,980
Ran, any words for the 10th anniversary of this series?

424
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,640
Shinichi, just how long do you expect to keep me waiting?

425
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,640
-I'm sorry. -Did you say something just now?
