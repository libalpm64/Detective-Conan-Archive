1
00:00:01,464 --> 00:00:02,864
Blink!

2
00:00:04,364 --> 00:00:06,364
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:06,364 --> 00:00:07,864
He finally finds the tricks of the men in the Black Organization.

4
00:00:07,864 --> 00:00:10,464
Bring up the big guns and beat the case and evil organization!

5
00:00:10,464 --> 00:00:11,864
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,864 --> 00:00:13,464
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,464 --> 00:00:15,364
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:59,211
With the testimony provided by a family

9
00:01:59,211 --> 00:02:01,511
who visited the Mouri Detective Agency,

10
00:02:01,511 --> 00:02:05,011
we solved a murder case.

11
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:08,211
At that time, Eisuke Hondo who was with us

12
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,111
used a lie detection technique to figure out

13
00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:12,011
whether someone's lying or not.

14
00:02:12,011 --> 00:02:13,511
In exactly

15
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:16,611
the same way as Rena Mizunashi used to do.

16
00:02:18,311 --> 00:02:20,111
No doubt about it.

17
00:02:20,111 --> 00:02:22,511
This guy is trying to get information...

18
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:27,311
on Rena Mizunashi.

19
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:34,211
"The Shadow of the Black Organization: Mysterious Hefty Reward"

20
00:02:34,211 --> 00:02:37,311
"Haido Central Hospital"

21
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,711
Kir.

22
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:36,511
Our organization is trying to find her but we have no idea where she is.

23
00:03:36,511 --> 00:03:38,411
I guess the FBI is not stupid.

24
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:42,911
Kir is dead.

25
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:44,311
This is for sure.

26
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:49,111
We should be happy if she simply did.

27
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:52,311
What if she was brainwashed and turned against us?

28
00:03:52,311 --> 00:03:53,311
That's not going to happen.

29
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:56,811
She didn't confess anything even after being shot,

30
00:03:56,811 --> 00:04:00,811
injected a truth drug and beaten until her ribs were broken.

31
00:04:00,811 --> 00:04:03,411
There's nothing to worry about, Chianti.

32
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:08,811
Are you talking about Kir getting his recognition?

33
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:12,011
-Yeah. -I have heard about that story, too.

34
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:15,011
Kir found a guy who snucked into the organization.

35
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:17,111
She got him cornered,

36
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:19,411
but ended up being caught.

37
00:04:19,411 --> 00:04:23,111
By the time you guys found her, she was almost dead because of torture.

38
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:26,511
But I still don't get it.

39
00:04:26,511 --> 00:04:29,211
How come she got his recognition

40
00:04:29,211 --> 00:04:32,011
and happened to be in the same team with us?

41
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:33,211
It's her teeth.

42
00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:34,211
Huh?

43
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,511
It was the only weapon left of her.

44
00:04:39,511 --> 00:04:43,511
She bit the guy's wrist so hard that his bone came out from his wrist.

45
00:04:46,311 --> 00:04:48,211
In addition to that,

46
00:04:48,211 --> 00:04:51,011
she took the gun away from him who already lost the will to fight

47
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:52,711
and blew up his head.

48
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:58,211
Only crazy animals can do that.

49
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:01,711
But I wonder. The guy died, right?

50
00:05:01,711 --> 00:05:04,411
How do we know that Kir didn't leak anything?

51
00:05:04,411 --> 00:05:07,911
The guy was hiding a MD recorder

52
00:05:07,911 --> 00:05:11,711
which actually recorded his voice torturing her.

53
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:14,711
An MD?

54
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:16,211
I see.

55
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:20,511
So there was no voice of Kir or whatsoever in that MD.

56
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:27,111
But we still don't know anything about this guy, right?

57
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:29,011
Right.

58
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:32,311
He had tons of driver's license and passports

59
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:35,311
with fake names and disguised pictures.

60
00:05:35,311 --> 00:05:37,811
Certainly, he was no ordinary guy.

61
00:05:38,811 --> 00:05:42,011
But we actually found out his real name.

62
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:45,211
I remember when you and I got there,

63
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:49,111
the guy's partner showed up at that place and kept whispering the name.

64
00:05:49,111 --> 00:05:53,311
Yeah. He was whispering the name to the guy's ear who no longer responded.

65
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,111
It was the name we couldn't find from driver's licenses or the passports.

66
00:05:55,111 --> 00:05:59,511
He kept calling the name like a scratched record.

67
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:02,211
Over and over.

68
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:08,411
He killed himself after he realized that we were there.

69
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:11,111
But what was his name anyway?

70
00:06:11,111 --> 00:06:13,311
It was too far from where I was. I couldn't hear anything.

71
00:06:14,711 --> 00:06:16,311
Well,

72
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:20,711
I can't really remember dead men's faces and names.

73
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:32,911
Well, I think I know where those guys are coming from.

74
00:06:32,911 --> 00:06:35,211
Anyway, let's ask Kir when she comes back.

75
00:06:36,611 --> 00:06:40,511
She probably heard that name, too.

76
00:06:40,511 --> 00:06:43,311
I hope we'll find her soon.

77
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:44,611
We will.

78
00:06:47,611 --> 00:06:51,411
We've already made a guess where she could be.

79
00:06:56,611 --> 00:06:58,811
Gosh, what are you thinking?

80
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:02,511
I've been waiting for this Sunday.

81
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:04,511
I was supposed to forget about all the depressing things

82
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:09,711
and enjoy an easygoing day with a hot coffee at Poirot.

83
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:12,111
And why do I see you here?

84
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:14,311
Eisuke Hondo.

85
00:07:14,311 --> 00:07:17,611
Come on. Don't be a mean.

86
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:20,811
You were the one who told him that he could visit us anytime, you know.

87
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:24,711
That's true, but it's 7:00 am.

88
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,511
I think it's kind of early.

89
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:30,211
I actually brought an interesting case today.

90
00:07:30,211 --> 00:07:31,811
What? A case?

91
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:35,511
What's the pay? Is the client rich?

92
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:37,511
No. Well,

93
00:07:37,511 --> 00:07:41,711
I just found something that looks like a case on a website,

94
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,711
-so there's no client. -Thank you very much!

95
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:48,111
That hurts...

96
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:49,411
Dad!

97
00:07:49,411 --> 00:07:50,811
Are you stupid?

98
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:53,211
What we are doing is not charity work!

99
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:55,411
But you should at least listen to his story.

100
00:07:55,411 --> 00:07:56,911
He came all the way here.

101
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:58,611
I told you.

102
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,611
-I don't have time. -That's right!

103
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:04,711
Today is the day that you are going to clean and organize

104
00:08:04,711 --> 00:08:06,811
Yoko Okino's VCRs that you recorded.

105
00:08:06,811 --> 00:08:07,811
Right?

106
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:09,611
Yeah, that's right!

107
00:08:09,611 --> 00:08:12,111
Conan, what happened to you?

108
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:15,011
You're usually interested in new cases.

109
00:08:16,811 --> 00:08:19,811
Yeah, I would.

110
00:08:19,811 --> 00:08:22,311
But not with the case he brought.

111
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:24,111
I'm sorry, Eisuke.

112
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:26,211
That's okay.

113
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:29,611
It looks kind of interesting, but it's not a major case at all.

114
00:08:29,611 --> 00:08:35,711
Maybe somebody got the idea from the "Red-headed League" and made it up.

115
00:08:35,711 --> 00:08:37,211
"The Red-headed League"?

116
00:08:37,211 --> 00:08:39,411
Oh, I know that!

117
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:42,711
It's a famous case in a Sherlock Holmes series, right?

118
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:47,111
I remember that this red-headed person gets a high salary,

119
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:51,511
but has to work in a room all day to copy an encyclopedia.

120
00:08:51,511 --> 00:08:54,211
The truth is, he was digging a hole on the basement of the store

121
00:08:54,211 --> 00:08:57,811
to sneak into a bank.

122
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:01,511
Hey, tell me about the case you found.

123
00:09:01,511 --> 00:09:02,511
What?

124
00:09:02,511 --> 00:09:05,011
Yeah, tell us. We'll listen.

125
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,711
But really, it's not a big case.

126
00:09:08,711 --> 00:09:10,311
Just tell us!

127
00:09:10,311 --> 00:09:11,711
Hey, Dad!

128
00:09:13,211 --> 00:09:16,211
It was last night when I found it.

129
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:19,911
It was the diary page of the website on the internet.

130
00:09:19,911 --> 00:09:21,411
Diary?

131
00:09:21,411 --> 00:09:24,311
Hey, you stole a glance at somebody's diary?

132
00:09:24,311 --> 00:09:25,611
No.

133
00:09:25,611 --> 00:09:30,311
The owner of the home page laid the diary open so everybody could see it.

134
00:09:30,311 --> 00:09:33,411
Really? That's an unusual hobby he has.

135
00:09:33,411 --> 00:09:37,811
So the owner of that home page has red hair?

136
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:40,611
No. What's similar to the "Red-headed League"

137
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:42,311
is the money this person pays.

138
00:09:42,311 --> 00:09:44,511
In the diary, it said,

139
00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:46,711
"Part-time job with super high wage!

140
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,711
Hurray for the economy!

141
00:09:47,711 --> 00:09:50,511
I got some good luck this year!"

142
00:09:51,811 --> 00:09:54,311
The people who are offering this job

143
00:09:54,311 --> 00:09:57,111
are actually a research organization that studies about detoxifying wastes

144
00:09:57,111 --> 00:10:00,111
and they need household wastes for their research.

145
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:01,711
All you need to do

146
00:10:01,711 --> 00:10:04,511
is to pick up trash bags from dump sites on burnable trash day,

147
00:10:04,511 --> 00:10:06,911
before the garbage truck comes.

148
00:10:06,911 --> 00:10:08,711
You return the trash bags on the next burnable trash day

149
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:10,211
and pick up new ones.

150
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:14,811
When you pick up trash,

151
00:10:14,811 --> 00:10:17,911
you use a car that's parked near the dump site.

152
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:21,211
After loading trash bags, you put the car back to where it was.

153
00:10:21,211 --> 00:10:24,711
On that afternoon, money will be sent to your bank account.

154
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:26,911
It's 50,000 yen.

155
00:10:27,911 --> 00:10:29,011
50,000 yen?

156
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:31,511
But wait...

157
00:10:31,511 --> 00:10:34,311
50,000 yen per pick up.

158
00:10:34,311 --> 00:10:36,311
There are two burnable trash days a week.

159
00:10:36,311 --> 00:10:38,411
That'll be 450,000 yen per month.

160
00:10:38,411 --> 00:10:39,811
450,000 yen.

161
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:41,011
450,000 yen?

162
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:43,011
Come on, Dad.

163
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:45,611
That's a crime. You know that, right?

164
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:51,711
But since it pays well for this stupid job,

165
00:10:51,711 --> 00:10:53,911
it's similar to the "Red-headed League".

166
00:10:53,911 --> 00:10:54,911
You're right.

167
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:56,111
The person who wrote this diary

168
00:10:56,111 --> 00:10:58,211
found this job on the internet job advertisement,

169
00:10:58,211 --> 00:11:00,311
and then communicated with the client by e-mail.

170
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:02,811
Three days later, a car key was sent to his house.

171
00:11:02,811 --> 00:11:05,811
It was about two weeks ago that he started the job.

172
00:11:05,811 --> 00:11:09,011
But under the agreement that he cannot quit until the client says so.

173
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:10,611
I got it.

174
00:11:10,611 --> 00:11:16,611
Perhaps, some celebrities are living around that area

175
00:11:16,611 --> 00:11:19,711
and this rich stalker is enjoying rummaging through their garbage.

176
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:23,011
The writer thought the same thing at first,

177
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:25,811
but he later wrote that no celebrity lived near there.

178
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:28,311
Really?

179
00:11:28,311 --> 00:11:29,711
But there's one thing that's bugging me.

180
00:11:29,711 --> 00:11:33,611
This guy said that there was no sign of anyone going through the garbage.

181
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:34,711
Huh?

182
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:36,611
Since the deal was too good,

183
00:11:36,611 --> 00:11:42,211
he got suspicious, so he took pictures of the trash in the trunk.

184
00:11:42,211 --> 00:11:45,311
On the next trash pickup day, he checked if there was any difference.

185
00:11:45,311 --> 00:11:48,911
Yet, nothing seemed to be moved from the way they were.

186
00:11:48,911 --> 00:11:51,411
Then why did the organization offer the job?

187
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,811
I don't know.

188
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:54,811
Just like the novel,

189
00:11:54,811 --> 00:11:58,911
the client must have been doing something bad near this guy's house

190
00:11:58,911 --> 00:12:03,211
while he was picking up the garbage.

191
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:06,211
Anyway, do you know this guy's address?

192
00:12:06,211 --> 00:12:10,311
No. He didn't write his home address on his website,

193
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:13,211
but he wrote where the dump site was.

194
00:12:13,211 --> 00:12:18,411
I think it was near the 3rd street park in Toriya Town.

195
00:12:18,411 --> 00:12:20,111
Toriya Town?

196
00:12:21,211 --> 00:12:24,711
What's the matter, Dad? Do you have something in mind?

197
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,211
Well, actually...

198
00:12:29,011 --> 00:12:32,311
A new Pachinko parlour has just opened.

199
00:12:32,311 --> 00:12:35,211
I was just thinking about going there!

200
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:39,311
All right. Why don't we go there now?

201
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:43,011
It's only 7:30 am. This guy might be there, you know.

202
00:12:43,011 --> 00:12:44,911
All right. Let's go, guys!

203
00:12:45,911 --> 00:12:47,611
Toriya Town?

204
00:12:53,225 --> 00:12:55,725
What is this?

205
00:12:55,725 --> 00:12:59,525
Look. Today is February 5th, Sunday.

206
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:02,425
The burnable trash day in this area is tomorrow on Monday

207
00:13:02,425 --> 00:13:04,925
and four days later on Thursday.

208
00:13:04,925 --> 00:13:06,125
Looks like it.

209
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,625
What?

210
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,225
What do you mean by that?

211
00:13:10,225 --> 00:13:13,325
No place does garbage pickup on Sunday.

212
00:13:14,525 --> 00:13:16,125
Well, actually...

213
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:19,225
This guy said on his diary

214
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:20,525
that he was told to pick up garbage quietly at early morning

215
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:23,325
to avoid any problems that might occur.

216
00:13:23,325 --> 00:13:25,325
Because their garbage detoxification research was not yet approved.

217
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:27,725
You fool! You should've said that beforehand!

218
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:28,725
Gosh!

219
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:29,825
That's it!

220
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:33,025
I'll be walking around here until the Pachinko parlour opens.

221
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:35,225
-You guys take a train and go home! -What?

222
00:13:35,225 --> 00:13:36,525
Gosh.

223
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:39,025
-Excuse me, sir. -Huh?

224
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:41,325
Did see you any tall person with a suspicious look around here

225
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:43,625
between 9:00 pm and 10:00 pm the night before?

226
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,825
-Hey, Takagi. -What?

227
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:48,325
Mr. Mouri!

228
00:13:48,325 --> 00:13:50,225
What are you doing here?

229
00:13:50,225 --> 00:13:51,325
What are you doing here, too?

230
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:53,625
Hey, hey, Mouri! You again?

231
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,725
Oh, Inspector!

232
00:13:55,725 --> 00:13:59,625
Please don't tell me that you are involved in this case, too?

233
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:00,825
Case?

234
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:03,825
There was a murder. Didn't you see the news on TV?

235
00:14:03,825 --> 00:14:05,525
What?

236
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:06,625
There was a murder?

237
00:14:14,325 --> 00:14:15,425
It's this house.

238
00:14:15,425 --> 00:14:17,725
Well, it looks great.

239
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:20,225
They are a family of considerable wealth.

240
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:21,825
Let's see.

241
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:24,525
The householder is Tatsuhito Funemoto.

242
00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:29,025
And the victim is his wife, Kaneyo, 39 years old.

243
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:32,325
Yesterday morning, she didn't get out of bed,

244
00:14:32,325 --> 00:14:34,925
so their housekeeper went to Kaneyo's room to call her.

245
00:14:34,925 --> 00:14:38,425
There she was found dead, leaning against the veranda wall.

246
00:14:38,425 --> 00:14:41,825
She was actually shot in the back of the head.

247
00:14:43,325 --> 00:14:45,425
Assuming by the angle of the bullet that was shot into her head,

248
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:50,225
it seems the criminal is a tall person, perhaps above 180 cm.

249
00:14:50,225 --> 00:14:52,225
Also, considering the estimated time of death,

250
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,725
it was between 9:00 pm to 10:00 pm,

251
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:57,625
the night before yesterday that Kaneyo was shot.

252
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:01,525
It was right after she came back from her friend's home party.

253
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:05,125
I see. Home party?

254
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,225
The bullet is missing because it penetrated the victim's head completely.

255
00:15:07,225 --> 00:15:12,125
We asked the neighbours in this area to search for it,

256
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,625
but we haven't found it yet.

257
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,225
So, what was the motive of the crime?

258
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:20,025
It was most likely robbery.

259
00:15:20,025 --> 00:15:24,825
Kaneyo was wearing a pearl necklace and bracelet.

260
00:15:24,825 --> 00:15:27,025
But both of them were gone.

261
00:15:28,225 --> 00:15:30,125
And, is there any witnesses?

262
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,825
Well,

263
00:15:31,825 --> 00:15:37,725
we haven't got any information related to the criminal.

264
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:40,525
I see.

265
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:43,425
This criminal knows what to do.

266
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:46,225
This person may be a professional.

267
00:15:46,225 --> 00:15:48,725
I was thinking the same thing.

268
00:15:48,725 --> 00:15:50,525
What's wrong, Inspector?

269
00:15:50,525 --> 00:15:52,225
You fool!

270
00:15:52,225 --> 00:15:55,425
Why are you explaining every single detail about the case

271
00:15:55,425 --> 00:15:58,225
to this man who has nothing to do with it?

272
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,925
Come on, Inspector.

273
00:16:01,925 --> 00:16:04,225
That's my habit, sir. I'm sorry.

274
00:16:04,225 --> 00:16:05,225
Toriya Town.

275
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,225
A murder.

276
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,425
No way.

277
00:16:12,425 --> 00:16:13,825
Could it be...

278
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:17,125
But this guy is involved in this case,

279
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,825
so I shouldn't take this as a normal murder case.

280
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:21,425
What's the matter, Conan?

281
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,125
Did you figure something out?

282
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,425
No!

283
00:16:26,425 --> 00:16:27,825
No way! No Way!

284
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:30,425
You guys are not involved in this case, so go home!

285
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:33,925
The police are going to take care of this.

286
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:35,825
We do not need Mouri's help.

287
00:16:37,325 --> 00:16:40,225
Gosh, I'm late!

288
00:16:40,225 --> 00:16:42,225
-Mr. Mouri? -All right, Inspector.

289
00:16:42,225 --> 00:16:44,025
We wish you a good luck on your investigation.

290
00:16:44,025 --> 00:16:45,525
Now, excuse me.

291
00:16:45,525 --> 00:16:47,125
So you're going home?

292
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,325
Hey, Dad!

293
00:16:49,325 --> 00:16:52,925
Why did Mr. Mouri run off in such a hurry?

294
00:16:52,925 --> 00:16:55,825
Well, he's investigating something.

295
00:16:55,825 --> 00:16:58,325
Investigating something?

296
00:16:58,325 --> 00:16:59,825
Mr. Mouri?

297
00:16:59,825 --> 00:17:01,025
Yes?

298
00:17:01,025 --> 00:17:03,625
Are you the famous Detective Mouri?

299
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,325
You're Mr. Kogoro Mouri, right?

300
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:07,125
Yes. I am Kogoro Mouri.

301
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,125
"Takami Shigeno (48)"

302
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,325
Please!

303
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:12,525
Find the criminal who took away Mrs. Funemoto's life!

304
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:13,625
What?

305
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,325
Well, but...

306
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,925
You should leave it to the police. They are reliable.

307
00:17:18,925 --> 00:17:21,925
I cannot count on those people!

308
00:17:21,925 --> 00:17:24,025
Please, Mr. Mouri!

309
00:17:24,025 --> 00:17:27,225
I really understand how you're feeling right now,

310
00:17:27,225 --> 00:17:30,625
but I have something that's really important to do.

311
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,125
I will return the favour if you do this for me.

312
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,925
What? Favour?

313
00:17:33,925 --> 00:17:35,525
Dad!

314
00:17:35,525 --> 00:17:37,825
All right.

315
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:39,725
Leave it up to me.

316
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:44,225
I, Kogoro Mouri, shall take revenge in her place.

317
00:17:44,225 --> 00:17:45,625
Thank you very much!

318
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,825
What's going on?

319
00:17:48,825 --> 00:17:50,825
Tonight is Kaneyo's wake.

320
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,425
Master.

321
00:17:53,425 --> 00:17:55,225
I'm sorry.

322
00:17:55,225 --> 00:17:57,625
This is the famous detective, Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

323
00:17:58,625 --> 00:17:59,625
"Tatsuhito Funemoto (43)"

324
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,725
Mouri?

325
00:18:00,725 --> 00:18:03,525
Oh, you are that famous...

326
00:18:03,525 --> 00:18:07,725
Yes. I am the famous Kogoro Mouri.

327
00:18:07,725 --> 00:18:10,125
But why are you here?

328
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,725
Well, it's kind of a coincidence.

329
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,125
No, it's not a coincidence.

330
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,525
Hey, Mouri!

331
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:17,825
I've got this.

332
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:20,325
You don't need to worry about anything because I'm here to help you.

333
00:18:20,325 --> 00:18:22,825
I will catch the criminal.

334
00:18:23,825 --> 00:18:28,825
Master, Mr. Mouri is going to take care of this case.

335
00:18:28,825 --> 00:18:31,025
You don't have to return me the favour right now.

336
00:18:31,025 --> 00:18:32,325
Mouri.

337
00:18:32,325 --> 00:18:34,425
Well, what's your concern, Inspector?

338
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:39,825
Mr. Mouri has helped us out on a lot of cases.

339
00:18:39,825 --> 00:18:40,825
Takagi.

340
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,725
Gosh, Dad.

341
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:47,525
Well, I knew it was going to end up like this.

342
00:18:47,525 --> 00:18:49,625
I'm so sorry, Eisuke.

343
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,325
Don't worry about it. I didn't have anything to do actually.

344
00:18:53,525 --> 00:18:55,525
Am I thinking too hard?

345
00:18:56,925 --> 00:19:00,125
It's very hard to think that he has something to do with them.

346
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,525
Mr. Detective!

347
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:05,125
I know who the criminal is!

348
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,125
-What? -Hey, Toji!

349
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,125
Who is this kid?

350
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,625
This is my son, Toji.

351
00:19:12,825 --> 00:19:14,725
"Toji Funemoto (8)" -No wonder he looks bright.

352
00:19:14,725 --> 00:19:19,225
It was a foreign woman in black who killed my mom!

353
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:21,125
Hey, that's enough!

354
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,625
Why, Dad?

355
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,325
How come you are not listening to me?

356
00:19:25,325 --> 00:19:27,725
Young master, why don't we go over there?

357
00:19:27,725 --> 00:19:30,225
No! Leave me alone!

358
00:19:32,425 --> 00:19:34,425
A foreign woman

359
00:19:34,425 --> 00:19:35,525
dressed in black?

360
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:39,925
Also, that boy...

361
00:19:41,725 --> 00:19:42,725
Young master!

362
00:19:42,725 --> 00:19:43,825
Toji!

363
00:19:43,825 --> 00:19:47,325
You have to believe me! Mister, you have to believe what I'm saying!

364
00:19:47,325 --> 00:19:49,725
That female foreigner looked suspicious!

365
00:19:49,725 --> 00:19:52,725
She must have killed Mom!

366
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,225
Have I met him before?

367
00:19:54,225 --> 00:19:55,625
I really saw her!

368
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,825
-Mister, please believe me! -Hey, you.

369
00:19:58,825 --> 00:20:02,625
Why do you think that this foreign woman is suspicious?

370
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,325
Because she was asking me strange questions.

371
00:20:05,325 --> 00:20:06,525
Strange questions?

372
00:20:06,525 --> 00:20:08,025
It was about the accident!

373
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:09,925
She asked me whether I really saw the accident,

374
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:12,625
or if I saw the face of the person who got into the accident,

375
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,925
and whether I talked about the accident to Mom and Dad!

376
00:20:15,925 --> 00:20:16,925
Accident?

377
00:20:19,225 --> 00:20:20,825
No way.

378
00:20:20,825 --> 00:20:23,625
And what did you tell her?

379
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,525
I told her that I talked a little bit about it.

380
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,125
She started showing an evil smile after she heard that.

381
00:20:31,925 --> 00:20:33,425
So that must be her!

382
00:20:33,425 --> 00:20:36,025
That woman killed Mom!

383
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:37,525
I remember it now!

384
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,425
He happened to be...

385
00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:49,625
in that accident.

386
00:20:51,425 --> 00:20:53,025
One of the members of the Black Organization...

387
00:20:54,825 --> 00:20:57,525
Kir, also known as Rena Mizunashi.

388
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:04,025
She was brought to the hospital because of that accident.

389
00:21:22,525 --> 00:21:24,725
He was at the scene of the accident.

390
00:21:24,725 --> 00:21:26,025
The boy back then...

391
00:21:27,725 --> 00:21:29,025
No doubt about it.

392
00:21:29,025 --> 00:21:30,325
Which means...

393
00:21:30,325 --> 00:21:33,625
Don't tell me this guy actually took us here because of the boy?

394
00:21:36,925 --> 00:21:39,425
What is he thinking?

395
00:21:39,425 --> 00:21:41,025
Does he know about this boy?

396
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:44,925
No, does he even know about the accident?

397
00:21:44,925 --> 00:21:48,125
The accident that FBI is trying to keep secret.

398
00:21:52,225 --> 00:21:54,925
I guess running away is not an option.

399
00:21:57,225 --> 00:21:58,625
That accident

400
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,025
and...

401
00:22:00,025 --> 00:22:01,725
Rena Mizunashi.

402
00:22:01,725 --> 00:22:05,925
Perhaps, the guys in the Black Organization are trying to find her.

403
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:07,825
The one who is being protected by FBI,

404
00:22:07,825 --> 00:22:09,325
Rena Mizunashi.

405
00:22:09,325 --> 00:22:11,325
No, Kir.

406
00:22:12,725 --> 00:22:15,225
Finally, it's getting interesting.

407
00:22:15,225 --> 00:22:17,725
I don't know what's coming.

408
00:22:17,725 --> 00:22:19,225
All right.

409
00:22:19,225 --> 00:22:20,225
I will take it.

410
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:22,825
This case.

411
00:22:27,825 --> 00:22:31,525
I am not going to run away.

412
00:24:46,825 --> 00:24:48,725
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:48,725 --> 00:24:50,925
"Scattering beans for Setsubun"

414
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:52,325
-Devils out! -It hurts!

415
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:54,425
-Next week, I'm going to fight the men in the Black Organization! -Ouch!

416
00:24:54,425 --> 00:24:55,825
Do you hear me, Conan?
