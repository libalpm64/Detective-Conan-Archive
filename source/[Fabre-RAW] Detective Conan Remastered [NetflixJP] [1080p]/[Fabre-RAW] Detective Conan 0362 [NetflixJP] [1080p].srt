1
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,250
Today's problem is a ghost scare.

2
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,850
Shine the light on unseen feelings

3
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,850
to resolve the ghost scare at school.

4
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,350
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,150
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,950
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:57,421 --> 00:02:01,721
Due to the off-season ghost scare at Teitan High school,

8
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:05,321
Ran begs Pops to solve the mystery of the scare,

9
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:07,521
but he refuses, saying that it is nonsense.

10
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:10,321
Therefore, out of my consideration for Ran whom I know hates ghosts,

11
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:13,021
I decide to participate in solving the mystery.

12
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:15,821
After school, when we were checking out the school building,

13
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:20,221
we find a desk that is very inappropriately on the campus grounds.

14
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:28,521
My grudge has not yet vanished.

15
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:36,221
"Teitan High School Ghost Story (Part 2)"

16
00:02:36,221 --> 00:02:39,721
"Principal's office" -I was on campus in the rain?

17
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:41,321
I haven't gone outside at all today.

18
00:02:41,321 --> 00:02:42,421
What?

19
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:47,321
Besides, I was at a faculty meeting while it was raining.

20
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:50,821
We were discussing the ghost scare.

21
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:52,721
By the way, Dr. Araide.

22
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:55,621
Thanks to the health exercise you taught me,

23
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:59,121
my back pains have gotten a lot better.

24
00:02:59,121 --> 00:03:00,421
I see.

25
00:03:00,421 --> 00:03:02,321
Hey, what on earth is going on?

26
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:04,021
Don't tell me that the upper classman is lying.

27
00:03:04,021 --> 00:03:06,021
No way!

28
00:03:06,021 --> 00:03:08,821
She probably mistook someone for him.

29
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,321
Hey.

30
00:03:10,321 --> 00:03:11,921
Why don't you ask Kazumi's friend

31
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:14,521
who is resting in the infirmary, then?

32
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:17,221
The ground is visible from the infirmary because it's right in front,

33
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:19,821
so he may have seen somebody, right?

34
00:03:19,821 --> 00:03:22,421
"Infirmary" -No, beats me.

35
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:26,721
After I left you guys, I was asleep in this bed here.

36
00:03:26,721 --> 00:03:27,921
Besides...

37
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:30,221
Take a look.

38
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:32,221
Even if you were to look outside,

39
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:35,421
it's virtually impossible to see anything on campus from this floor, right?

40
00:03:35,421 --> 00:03:38,421
What kind of garden was the principal thinking of making anyway?

41
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:41,721
So, even if someone suspicious was to be loitering on the ground,

42
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,621
I don't think I would've noticed.

43
00:03:43,621 --> 00:03:47,421
By the way, where's the nurse?

44
00:03:47,421 --> 00:03:50,621
She left for the day saying she was going to driving school.

45
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:53,321
She told me to hurry on home and go to bed

46
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:56,221
because my house is really close to school.

47
00:03:56,221 --> 00:03:58,921
After the wailing in the storeroom of the gym,

48
00:03:58,921 --> 00:04:00,221
is the grudge filled library,

49
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:04,021
the cursed stairs, and now the chair and desk on campus.

50
00:04:04,021 --> 00:04:06,321
Poor Hosaka.

51
00:04:06,321 --> 00:04:10,821
I heard that you were childhood friends with Hosaka.

52
00:04:10,821 --> 00:04:11,921
Yeah.

53
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:13,721
I was with him from elementary to Jr. high,

54
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:17,021
but after we entered high school, I hardly got to see him

55
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:18,521
because I got into an accident riding my motorbike

56
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:19,821
as soon as I entered high school,

57
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:22,021
and was hospitalized for nearly half a year.

58
00:04:22,021 --> 00:04:25,721
Then, you didn't know that he fell down the stairs.

59
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:27,721
No, not until I was discharged from the hospital

60
00:04:27,721 --> 00:04:29,321
and came back to school.

61
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:33,521
And? Was there anybody who was all worked up over this ghost bit?

62
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:36,821
Those guys who're making a big thing of this ghost scare

63
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:38,121
are the very ones who probably made this all up

64
00:04:38,121 --> 00:04:40,521
and are having their thrills laughing inside, right?

65
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:43,121
What? You mean me?

66
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:44,521
It's possible.

67
00:04:45,121 --> 00:04:47,421
One other person I can think of that was making a fuss over it is

68
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:49,821
the guy confined in the art room all alone drawing pictures.

69
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:51,221
Don't you think he's suspicious?

70
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:55,721
Even the guy we just saw in the infirmary is just as suspicious.

71
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:59,721
Because the storeroom where the desk was is near the infirmary.

72
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:04,221
Moreover, if you use this slated drain board,

73
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,721
you can go directly out to the campus.

74
00:05:06,721 --> 00:05:09,121
Then, the suspicious ones are those two?

75
00:05:09,121 --> 00:05:11,821
Not really. There's one more person.

76
00:05:11,821 --> 00:05:13,921
Kazumi is also to be suspected.

77
00:05:13,921 --> 00:05:15,621
What? Why?

78
00:05:15,621 --> 00:05:17,521
Well, if she went to the restroom,

79
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:20,321
it means she left the library, doesn't it?

80
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,721
I guess so.

81
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,721
Now that you mentioned it, I wonder why she came

82
00:05:24,721 --> 00:05:27,821
when we were checking the storeroom of the gym?

83
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:29,721
It must've been by chance and besides,

84
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:31,621
if she did play such a prank,

85
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:34,121
wouldn't she have left for home?

86
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:35,321
Not really.

87
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:39,321
Before I went out to campus to go to the desk with Dr. Araide,

88
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:41,521
just a while ago, I went to the shoes box to get my shoes

89
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:45,321
but despite the doorway and the school building being wet with rain,

90
00:05:45,321 --> 00:05:47,221
I saw no footprints.

91
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:50,121
Which means that the person making up the ghost scare is...

92
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:52,921
Still in the school building somewhere.

93
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:54,121
Yes.

94
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:58,421
If the same person is making up all four ghost scares,

95
00:05:58,421 --> 00:05:59,821
it's extremely likely that this person

96
00:05:59,821 --> 00:06:01,521
knows about the student called Hosaka

97
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:03,721
who accidentally died two years ago,

98
00:06:03,721 --> 00:06:07,221
as well as know a lot about the scene of the accident.

99
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:10,821
Hardly no one passes through this corridor after school,

100
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:12,321
and moreover, if the teachers were all gathered

101
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:15,121
in the teacher's room having a conference...

102
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:16,921
Whether it be from the infirmary on the first floor,

103
00:06:16,921 --> 00:06:18,821
the art room on the second floor

104
00:06:18,821 --> 00:06:20,821
or from the third floor library,

105
00:06:20,821 --> 00:06:23,921
the person could secretly without being seen by anyone

106
00:06:23,921 --> 00:06:27,921
carry the desk and chair out to campus. It's not impossible.

107
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:32,021
The problem is, how were the desk and chair placed there

108
00:06:32,021 --> 00:06:35,321
without leaving any footprints behind, and for what purpose.

109
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:36,821
There must be something involved.

110
00:06:36,821 --> 00:06:39,621
A reason for causing the ghost scare.

111
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:45,421
Huh?

112
00:06:45,421 --> 00:06:48,621
I wonder what this is on top of the drain board.

113
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:50,721
It looks like traces of someone having splashed water.

114
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:52,021
I wonder if there were water traces like this

115
00:06:52,021 --> 00:06:54,621
when we passed here a while ago?

116
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:56,221
Don't tell me that...

117
00:06:58,521 --> 00:06:59,721
Conan!

118
00:06:59,721 --> 00:07:01,221
If that's the case,

119
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,521
the traces of it should be somewhere on the campus.

120
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:08,521
I found it! This is it!

121
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:13,521
You're not supposed to go outside with slippers.

122
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:16,821
To think that I didn't notice how such an easy trick was carried out...

123
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:21,021
But this trick can be carried out by any of the three.

124
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:24,621
In order to get the evidence, although it's a bit reckless...

125
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:26,421
Ran.

126
00:07:26,421 --> 00:07:29,321
Will you all wait for me in front of the art room?

127
00:07:29,321 --> 00:07:32,921
I've figured out a way to find out who is doing all this.

128
00:07:32,921 --> 00:07:34,321
What?

129
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,021
"Art room"

130
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:37,521
He's late!

131
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:38,921
How long does he intend to keep us waiting?

132
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:40,121
Oh, there he is!

133
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:43,721
What'd you do?

134
00:07:43,721 --> 00:07:45,221
Oh, some things.

135
00:07:45,221 --> 00:07:48,121
I hope we're really going to be able to figure things out here

136
00:07:48,121 --> 00:07:50,521
about the culprit of the ghost scare.

137
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:53,221
Hey, you glasses kid...

138
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:56,921
Hey! I thought I told you not to come inside!

139
00:07:56,921 --> 00:08:00,121
Are you getting ready to go home?

140
00:08:00,121 --> 00:08:02,021
Getting ready to go home?

141
00:08:02,021 --> 00:08:05,321
Yeah, I have everything here so that I can go home right away.

142
00:08:05,321 --> 00:08:07,121
Hey there! Sorry to intrude on you.

143
00:08:07,121 --> 00:08:09,821
Seko? What brings you here?

144
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:13,921
This brat told me that if I come here,

145
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:17,121
I'll get to see who the one that's causing the ghost scare is,

146
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,651
so I came.

147
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:21,051
He said that it may take a while,

148
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:24,151
so I gathered my stuff before coming.

149
00:08:24,151 --> 00:08:25,551
Oh, my.

150
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:26,851
Same here.

151
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:29,451
Kazumi?

152
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:31,851
Your umbrella's all muddy.

153
00:08:31,851 --> 00:08:33,451
Right.

154
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:35,051
I was watching the weather forecast this morning

155
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:37,051
and in my rush, I picked an old umbrella

156
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:39,451
that I used to use when I was a child.

157
00:08:40,751 --> 00:08:43,251
Hey, stop dusting mud off here!

158
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:45,051
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:45,051 --> 00:08:47,251
So? Did you figure out who the culprit is?

160
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:49,451
Nope. It seems the show's going to start now.

161
00:08:49,451 --> 00:08:52,351
Hey. Are sure everything's going to work out, Conan?

162
00:08:53,651 --> 00:08:55,851
No doubt about it.

163
00:08:57,451 --> 00:09:01,151
That one's the culprit.

164
00:09:08,974 --> 00:09:10,074
"Art room"

165
00:09:10,074 --> 00:09:11,374
And?

166
00:09:11,374 --> 00:09:14,474
Where's the one who caused this ghost scare?

167
00:09:14,474 --> 00:09:16,874
You said that we'd all find out if we came here, right?

168
00:09:16,874 --> 00:09:18,774
-Conan. -Yes.

169
00:09:18,774 --> 00:09:22,674
That ghost scare is rumored to be the doings of the spirit of the person

170
00:09:22,674 --> 00:09:26,274
called Hosaka who fell off the stairs two years ago and died, right?

171
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,274
Yes.

172
00:09:28,274 --> 00:09:32,074
The stairs is the one near the art room.

173
00:09:32,074 --> 00:09:36,074
If so, let's just wait forever very quietly.

174
00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:37,674
Wait for what?

175
00:09:37,674 --> 00:09:38,974
What else...

176
00:09:38,974 --> 00:09:44,274
but for the ghost of Mr. Hosaka to come dripping wet down the stairs.

177
00:09:44,874 --> 00:09:46,474
Hey!

178
00:09:46,474 --> 00:09:48,274
It hurts!

179
00:09:49,374 --> 00:09:52,974
Listen, we're trying to find the bad one

180
00:09:52,974 --> 00:09:56,274
who's trying to make everything look like the doings of the ghost.

181
00:09:56,274 --> 00:09:59,774
Mouri. Sorry, but I think I'll head for home.

182
00:09:59,774 --> 00:10:01,274
I guess I will, too.

183
00:10:02,274 --> 00:10:03,774
I'm leaving, too.

184
00:10:03,774 --> 00:10:06,574
I can't possibly concentrate on drawing with you guys around.

185
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,274
It's only starting to get interesting now.

186
00:10:10,274 --> 00:10:11,574
Thanks to the glasses kid,

187
00:10:11,574 --> 00:10:12,974
I can't seem to come up with any inspiration.

188
00:10:12,974 --> 00:10:14,774
The fun of it all is disappearing, so I guess...

189
00:10:16,774 --> 00:10:18,174
Sonoko?

190
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:26,474
Sonoko!

191
00:10:26,474 --> 00:10:28,274
Did the usual come?

192
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:29,774
The usual?

193
00:10:29,774 --> 00:10:31,874
Sonoko is just like my father,

194
00:10:31,874 --> 00:10:34,274
doing that when she figures out a case.

195
00:10:34,274 --> 00:10:37,374
No. The way she fell just now was not normal.

196
00:10:37,374 --> 00:10:39,274
Let me check her.

197
00:10:39,274 --> 00:10:40,474
Oh, no!

198
00:10:42,574 --> 00:10:44,074
Don't touch me, okay?

199
00:10:44,074 --> 00:10:45,774
Huh?

200
00:10:45,774 --> 00:10:48,274
Because I, deduction queen Sonoko,

201
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:50,674
is about to start a deduction show now.

202
00:10:50,674 --> 00:10:51,974
So, it came after all.

203
00:10:51,974 --> 00:10:54,074
Yes, I've figured it out

204
00:10:54,074 --> 00:10:56,574
the identity of the one who started all this ghost scare

205
00:10:56,574 --> 00:10:59,574
while sneaking and hiding behind the scenes.

206
00:10:59,574 --> 00:11:03,074
As for you, I think you need to hide a bit of something.

207
00:11:03,074 --> 00:11:04,474
What?

208
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:06,974
Talk about showing it all!

209
00:11:06,974 --> 00:11:09,474
Sonoko, your panty's showing!

210
00:11:10,574 --> 00:11:12,574
Oh, my! I'm sorry!

211
00:11:12,574 --> 00:11:13,874
Since I've figured out the truth,

212
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:16,074
I seem to have gone weak and relaxed a bit too much.

213
00:11:16,074 --> 00:11:17,074
Gosh.

214
00:11:17,074 --> 00:11:21,174
Because it turned out to such a simple trick.

215
00:11:21,174 --> 00:11:22,374
Simple?

216
00:11:22,374 --> 00:11:24,074
Then, you've figured it out?

217
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:26,474
The mystery of the desk and chair put out on campus

218
00:11:26,474 --> 00:11:28,374
without leaving any footprints.

219
00:11:28,374 --> 00:11:32,974
The piece of paper on the desk was not wet at all.

220
00:11:32,974 --> 00:11:35,374
Right, that piece of paper.

221
00:11:35,374 --> 00:11:37,574
I was thrown off by the paper that wasn't wet at all

222
00:11:37,574 --> 00:11:40,274
and had completely forgotten about something.

223
00:11:40,274 --> 00:11:43,474
Even if the desk and chair were carried out while it was raining,

224
00:11:43,474 --> 00:11:46,974
the footprints would be erased by the rain.

225
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:50,174
The footprints may disappear,

226
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:53,474
but won't the piece of paper on the desk also get wet?

227
00:11:53,474 --> 00:11:56,574
If you don't want to get wet, what would you do, Ran?

228
00:11:56,574 --> 00:11:59,774
Well, I'll wait somewhere until it stops raining.

229
00:11:59,774 --> 00:12:02,174
Or wear a raincoat.

230
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:03,774
Or...

231
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:06,574
You mean...

232
00:12:06,574 --> 00:12:07,774
Right.

233
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:10,474
All the culprit did was cover the paper,

234
00:12:10,474 --> 00:12:12,374
so that it wouldn't get wet,

235
00:12:12,374 --> 00:12:15,374
using an umbrella with a long string attached to it.

236
00:12:15,374 --> 00:12:16,774
After it stops raining,

237
00:12:16,774 --> 00:12:18,074
the string attached to the umbrella is pulled

238
00:12:18,074 --> 00:12:20,074
and the umbrella is retrieved to the school building.

239
00:12:20,074 --> 00:12:22,474
This way, no footprints are left behind on the wet, muddy campus

240
00:12:22,474 --> 00:12:25,774
and the piece of paper is still dry.

241
00:12:25,774 --> 00:12:28,474
The traces were clearly left behind on campus.

242
00:12:28,474 --> 00:12:32,374
The traces of the tip of the frame of the umbrella touching the ground

243
00:12:32,374 --> 00:12:35,274
when the string was pulled to take the umbrella in.

244
00:12:35,274 --> 00:12:37,074
On the drain board that is placed from the campus grounds

245
00:12:37,074 --> 00:12:38,674
to the entrance of the school building,

246
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,874
there were traces of water being splattered.

247
00:12:40,874 --> 00:12:42,374
This serves as yet another evidence.

248
00:12:42,374 --> 00:12:43,974
The water that was splattered there was from the umbrella

249
00:12:43,974 --> 00:12:46,374
that was retrieved and shook to shake off excess water.

250
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:50,474
But that's not enough to shake off all the rain water.

251
00:12:50,474 --> 00:12:54,374
The more time passes, the more water sinks in.

252
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:57,174
Then, the person who caused the ghost scare was...

253
00:12:57,174 --> 00:12:59,974
-Could it possibly be... -Yes, that's right.

254
00:12:59,974 --> 00:13:01,774
The culprit is the one who owns the umbrella

255
00:13:01,774 --> 00:13:03,974
that has rain water flowing out of it.

256
00:13:03,974 --> 00:13:06,974
You, Kunishige Seko!

257
00:13:06,974 --> 00:13:08,874
You were sleeping in the infirmary

258
00:13:08,874 --> 00:13:10,674
saying that you weren't feeling good

259
00:13:10,674 --> 00:13:13,974
just to carry out this trick.

260
00:13:13,974 --> 00:13:16,874
The weather forecast said that there would be a shower

261
00:13:16,874 --> 00:13:18,974
from around noon to sundown,

262
00:13:18,974 --> 00:13:21,374
but you didn't know exactly what time it would be.

263
00:13:21,374 --> 00:13:24,174
You carried the desk and chair that were in the storeroom of the gym

264
00:13:24,174 --> 00:13:27,174
out to the campus grounds secretly,

265
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:29,074
covered the desk with an umbrella with string attached to it

266
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,274
and went back to the infirmary for the time being.

267
00:13:31,274 --> 00:13:33,274
All you had to do now is wait for it to stop raining

268
00:13:33,274 --> 00:13:36,674
pull the string and retrieve the umbrella.

269
00:13:36,674 --> 00:13:41,274
But, what if someone saw the umbrella on the desk?

270
00:13:41,274 --> 00:13:43,374
The campus ground cannot be seen from the first floor

271
00:13:43,374 --> 00:13:45,474
because the trees are in the way,

272
00:13:45,474 --> 00:13:47,274
and if viewed from the 2nd and 3rd floor,

273
00:13:47,274 --> 00:13:48,574
it would just look as if someone is standing in place

274
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:51,174
in the rain with an umbrella.

275
00:13:51,174 --> 00:13:54,674
Then, do you mean that the principal I saw was...

276
00:13:54,674 --> 00:13:57,774
You just made a mistake because the color of the umbrella

277
00:13:57,774 --> 00:13:59,374
was the same as the one the principal who used to go out

278
00:13:59,374 --> 00:14:01,074
into the grounds everyday had.

279
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,674
Hey. You're going to call me the culprit

280
00:14:03,674 --> 00:14:05,174
just because my umbrella was wet?

281
00:14:05,174 --> 00:14:06,874
Since my umbrella was really dirty,

282
00:14:06,874 --> 00:14:10,974
I washed it off at the faucet just a while ago, that's why it was wet.

283
00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:12,774
Besides, if it's a trick like that,

284
00:14:12,774 --> 00:14:15,974
Monobe and Tsukamoto could've done it too, right?

285
00:14:15,974 --> 00:14:18,374
No, you're the one.

286
00:14:18,374 --> 00:14:21,374
It's interesting that if you are the one,

287
00:14:21,374 --> 00:14:24,374
the answers to all the other ghost scares fall into place.

288
00:14:24,374 --> 00:14:27,174
The library of grudge, the cursed stairs,

289
00:14:27,174 --> 00:14:28,574
and the wailing in the storeroom of the gym,

290
00:14:28,574 --> 00:14:30,974
that is, the three ghostly phenomenon!

291
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:33,174
First for the library of grudge,

292
00:14:33,174 --> 00:14:34,574
where the four books that Hosaka had borrowed,

293
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,974
being left out without being put away for 4 consecutive days.

294
00:14:36,974 --> 00:14:40,374
But, isn't that something that anybody could've done?

295
00:14:40,374 --> 00:14:42,074
If you look at the library card,

296
00:14:42,074 --> 00:14:44,574
you can get the names of the people who borrowed the book in the past.

297
00:14:44,574 --> 00:14:47,774
Do you remember the title of the four books?

298
00:14:47,774 --> 00:14:49,474
The title?

299
00:14:49,474 --> 00:14:51,574
I think it was electric, something...

300
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:53,674
"Theory of Telecommunication".

301
00:14:53,674 --> 00:14:55,874
"Report of the Destruction of Tropical Rainforests".

302
00:14:55,874 --> 00:14:57,674
"The History of the University System".

303
00:14:57,674 --> 00:14:59,874
"Analysis of Rock Destruction Sound".

304
00:14:59,874 --> 00:15:03,074
No ordinary person could search and find these four books

305
00:15:03,074 --> 00:15:05,174
that virtually no one would bother to touch at all.

306
00:15:05,174 --> 00:15:06,974
But, you, Mr. Seko, was his childhood friend

307
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:10,574
and knew his hobbies very well.

308
00:15:10,574 --> 00:15:13,374
Then, what about the cursed stairs?

309
00:15:13,374 --> 00:15:16,274
So you're saying Seko is responsible

310
00:15:16,274 --> 00:15:18,074
for the bottom of the stairs being wet?

311
00:15:18,074 --> 00:15:22,874
Yes. Isn't there a hole there where the extinguisher is kept?

312
00:15:22,874 --> 00:15:25,874
Mr. Seko probably got ice ready

313
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:28,174
and hid it behind the fire extinguisher after school.

314
00:15:28,174 --> 00:15:29,574
The following morning,

315
00:15:29,574 --> 00:15:32,374
he wanted someone to find the water soaked floor

316
00:15:32,374 --> 00:15:35,174
because of the melted ice, which he prepared during the night.

317
00:15:35,174 --> 00:15:39,374
That's why you put wax on the floor right below the dent, right?

318
00:15:39,374 --> 00:15:41,774
You used the wax as a water repellent,

319
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,574
so that it wouldn't look as if water flowed out from the dent.

320
00:15:44,574 --> 00:15:45,774
Mr. Seko, whose house is near the school

321
00:15:45,774 --> 00:15:48,574
is the only one who could've done something like this.

322
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:49,974
I see.

323
00:15:49,974 --> 00:15:53,674
He went home to get the ice after school.

324
00:15:53,674 --> 00:15:55,274
But, why?

325
00:15:55,274 --> 00:15:57,174
Why would you, who used to be Hosaka's childhood friend

326
00:15:57,174 --> 00:15:59,274
do something like this?

327
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:01,674
Depending on your answer, you're going to get it!

328
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:03,174
The whole thing probably started

329
00:16:03,174 --> 00:16:05,074
with the wailing in the storeroom of the gym.

330
00:16:06,274 --> 00:16:07,674
The wailing that the students

331
00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:11,174
who came for early morning practice heard

332
00:16:11,174 --> 00:16:13,574
was Mr. Seko's voice.

333
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:16,774
If Mr. Seko's ping-pong club also had early morning practice that day,

334
00:16:16,774 --> 00:16:19,374
it's natural that he would be in the storeroom of the gym.

335
00:16:19,374 --> 00:16:23,074
Maybe he noticed Mr. Hosaka's desk and chair for the first time that day,

336
00:16:23,074 --> 00:16:25,574
it's not strange to think that

337
00:16:25,574 --> 00:16:28,374
Mr. Hosaka's death was no accident.

338
00:16:28,374 --> 00:16:29,774
Yeah, that's right.

339
00:16:29,774 --> 00:16:31,974
It dawned on me right away

340
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:33,774
that Hosaka was bullied and killed

341
00:16:33,774 --> 00:16:36,174
while I was in the hospital!

342
00:16:37,274 --> 00:16:39,274
You mentioned just a while ago,

343
00:16:39,274 --> 00:16:40,374
that I knew what kind of books he would borrow

344
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,574
because I was his childhood friend, right?

345
00:16:43,574 --> 00:16:45,574
Actually, that's not it.

346
00:16:45,574 --> 00:16:48,674
Those four books were the books that Hosaka brought with him

347
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,974
when he came to visit me everyday at the hospital.

348
00:16:50,974 --> 00:16:53,674
In order to cheer me up,

349
00:16:53,674 --> 00:16:58,274
he told me about the funny and interesting stories he made up

350
00:16:58,274 --> 00:17:00,074
after reading those books.

351
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:02,274
But he suddenly stopped coming.

352
00:17:02,274 --> 00:17:04,874
I thought that maybe he found a girl he liked or something.

353
00:17:04,874 --> 00:17:07,074
I didn't think he had died of an accident.

354
00:17:07,074 --> 00:17:08,174
After being discharged from the hospital,

355
00:17:08,174 --> 00:17:09,274
I investigated on his accident,

356
00:17:09,274 --> 00:17:12,474
but all I found out was that he fell from the stairs.

357
00:17:12,474 --> 00:17:15,574
That is, until I found his desk with his signature

358
00:17:15,574 --> 00:17:18,174
on it in the storeroom of the gym!

359
00:17:18,174 --> 00:17:20,274
That's why I wanted to find

360
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:22,774
the one who hid his desk into the storeroom.

361
00:17:22,774 --> 00:17:27,674
I wanted to find the one who pushed him off the stairs!

362
00:17:27,674 --> 00:17:29,374
Wrong.

363
00:17:29,374 --> 00:17:32,374
Hosaka didn't fall off the stairs, nor was he bullied.

364
00:17:32,374 --> 00:17:33,674
I'm to blame!

365
00:17:33,674 --> 00:17:35,074
What?

366
00:17:35,074 --> 00:17:36,574
That day, early in the morning,

367
00:17:36,574 --> 00:17:40,974
two stone statues were scheduled to be delivered to school.

368
00:17:40,974 --> 00:17:44,274
Both Hosaka and I were weekly monitors that day,

369
00:17:44,274 --> 00:17:46,274
so we secretly carried the two statues

370
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:47,974
to the art room early in the morning.

371
00:17:47,974 --> 00:17:50,574
We were planning to place the statues by the door

372
00:17:50,574 --> 00:17:52,374
to surprise the art teacher.

373
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,874
But because we were rushing to set up the statues

374
00:17:56,874 --> 00:17:58,374
before the teacher arrives,

375
00:17:58,374 --> 00:18:01,074
we went past the 2nd floor art room to the 3rd floor.

376
00:18:01,074 --> 00:18:03,174
Since Hosaka told me this, I rushed to turn back

377
00:18:03,174 --> 00:18:04,974
and tripped.

378
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,774
Hosaka tried to protect me from falling

379
00:18:15,774 --> 00:18:18,274
and was crushed by me and the statue.

380
00:18:18,274 --> 00:18:20,174
That's why Hosaka wasn't being bullied.

381
00:18:20,174 --> 00:18:21,874
That's a lie!

382
00:18:21,874 --> 00:18:24,874
Then, why was his desk put in a dimly lit place like that

383
00:18:24,874 --> 00:18:26,774
and covered with dust?

384
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:29,874
-No matter how you look at it... -We didn't want to erase the signs

385
00:18:29,874 --> 00:18:34,174
that Hosaka was coming to the same school as we were.

386
00:18:34,174 --> 00:18:36,774
His signature was written in pencil,

387
00:18:36,774 --> 00:18:39,174
so if left as it would've rubbed off eventually, right?

388
00:18:39,174 --> 00:18:40,574
After the accident,

389
00:18:40,574 --> 00:18:43,274
the drawings of the faces of all his classmates

390
00:18:43,274 --> 00:18:46,274
was found in his notebook, so we got sad

391
00:18:46,274 --> 00:18:48,774
and asked the teacher a favor.

392
00:18:48,774 --> 00:18:50,874
That is, to put his desk out in one of the classrooms

393
00:18:50,874 --> 00:18:53,274
on the day of our graduation,

394
00:18:53,274 --> 00:18:56,574
so that he can graduate together with us.

395
00:18:56,574 --> 00:18:59,374
At first, the teacher gave a sour look,

396
00:18:59,374 --> 00:19:01,074
but we asked the teacher to let us

397
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:02,474
keep the desk and chair in the storeroom of the gym

398
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,274
after the class collected enough money to buy them.

399
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:07,974
We should've told you about it too,

400
00:19:07,974 --> 00:19:10,474
but we found out that you were childhood friends with Hosaka

401
00:19:10,474 --> 00:19:13,974
only after the ghost scare.

402
00:19:13,974 --> 00:19:15,174
I see.

403
00:19:15,174 --> 00:19:17,874
That's why you were at the storeroom back then.

404
00:19:17,874 --> 00:19:18,874
Yes.

405
00:19:18,874 --> 00:19:23,974
I thought maybe Seko might be where Hosaka's desk was.

406
00:19:23,974 --> 00:19:26,274
Then...

407
00:19:26,274 --> 00:19:30,374
he wasn't bullied or had a grudge on anybody.

408
00:19:30,374 --> 00:19:31,574
No.

409
00:19:31,574 --> 00:19:34,074
If anybody, I'm the only one he'd have a grudge against.

410
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:36,874
After all, I'm the one who thought up that stupid prank, too.

411
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:38,474
No.

412
00:19:38,474 --> 00:19:41,374
I'm sure he holds no grudge against you.

413
00:19:41,374 --> 00:19:45,274
Well, I was the first one to be called to the site of the accident.

414
00:19:45,274 --> 00:19:48,974
Back then, he kept mumbling.

415
00:19:48,974 --> 00:19:51,074
That maybe the teacher will be even more surprised

416
00:19:51,074 --> 00:19:53,674
if he fell to the ground as is.

417
00:19:55,174 --> 00:19:56,974
Just as expected of him.

418
00:21:27,074 --> 00:21:28,774
Just as expected of you, Sonoko!

419
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:32,674
Your deduction was superb as always.

420
00:21:32,674 --> 00:21:34,874
Yeah, I guess so.

421
00:21:34,874 --> 00:21:36,974
I don't remember, though, like always.

422
00:21:38,374 --> 00:21:41,174
But what a surprise it was to hear that Dr. Araide

423
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:44,374
heard the last words spoken by that student.

424
00:21:44,374 --> 00:21:45,774
Oh, well...

425
00:21:45,774 --> 00:21:49,174
The truth is, he was in no condition to talk at all.

426
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,574
But I figured at that time, it was best to say so,

427
00:21:51,574 --> 00:21:54,274
to make those seniors feel relieved.

428
00:21:54,274 --> 00:21:55,774
I couldn't help lying.

429
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:57,374
I see.

430
00:21:57,374 --> 00:22:00,474
Dr. Araide, you're really so kind.

431
00:22:00,474 --> 00:22:01,474
Huh?

432
00:22:01,474 --> 00:22:04,674
Well, what a relief that there were no ghosts.

433
00:22:04,674 --> 00:22:07,574
Yes! I won't have to worry about being monitor next week anymore!

434
00:22:07,574 --> 00:22:10,574
Okay! Maybe I'll go talk to the newspaper club about my deduction

435
00:22:10,574 --> 00:22:13,074
-and give them a scoop article! -I think you shouldn't do anything.

436
00:22:13,074 --> 00:22:15,474
There'll be no ghost scares anymore.

437
00:22:15,474 --> 00:22:18,474
Besides, rumors vanish with time.

438
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:25,874
I'm sorry. I've got an important phone call.

439
00:22:25,874 --> 00:22:27,874
We'll be on our way then.

440
00:22:27,874 --> 00:22:30,274
Goodbye, Dr. Araide!

441
00:22:32,574 --> 00:22:34,274
Hello?

442
00:22:34,274 --> 00:22:36,374
Yes, Araide here.

443
00:22:38,974 --> 00:22:41,374
Really? I'm happy for you

444
00:22:41,374 --> 00:22:42,774
that you got yourself smoothly into school

445
00:22:42,774 --> 00:22:44,874
without anyone being suspicious.

446
00:22:44,874 --> 00:22:46,974
Yes, thanks to you.

447
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:49,174
Since you told me

448
00:22:49,174 --> 00:22:53,274
how the imposter was going around in school.

449
00:22:53,274 --> 00:22:56,374
Then, this is the last time I'll be calling you.

450
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:59,174
Forget me completely.

451
00:22:59,174 --> 00:23:01,774
Wait! There's one thing I'd like to ask you.

452
00:23:01,774 --> 00:23:05,374
The person who was disguised as me...

453
00:23:05,374 --> 00:23:08,974
Dr. Araide, you sure are a push-over like always.

454
00:23:08,974 --> 00:23:10,374
Was that person really...

455
00:23:10,374 --> 00:23:15,374
Before that worried teacher decides to lug me off to the hospital.

456
00:23:15,374 --> 00:23:18,874
Thanks to the health exercise you taught me,

457
00:23:18,874 --> 00:23:21,874
my back pains have gotten a lot better.

458
00:23:21,874 --> 00:23:23,374
Was that person really...

459
00:23:23,374 --> 00:23:26,274
Dr. Araide, you're really so kind.

460
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:30,474
A bad person?

461
00:23:32,674 --> 00:23:35,674
Every time I get in touch with the students or teachers at school,

462
00:23:35,674 --> 00:23:37,374
he just doesn't seem to be a bad person.

463
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,474
What a fool!

464
00:23:38,474 --> 00:23:40,374
A person who can smile when killing someone

465
00:23:40,374 --> 00:23:42,574
can never be a good person!

466
00:23:46,474 --> 00:23:49,774
Yes. All that woman did was trace your personality

467
00:23:49,774 --> 00:23:52,374
in order to become your imposter.

468
00:23:52,374 --> 00:23:54,174
And she did so frighteningly accurately.

469
00:23:56,374 --> 00:23:58,074
That's all.

470
00:24:31,901 --> 00:24:34,301
Next Conan's Hint:

471
00:24:34,301 --> 00:24:35,701
"Lottery"

472
00:24:35,701 --> 00:24:36,901
City crows resemble...

473
00:24:36,901 --> 00:24:38,401
-Information society. -Why do you say that?

474
00:24:38,401 --> 00:24:40,201
Problems of scattered trash are resolved by the net.

475
00:24:40,201 --> 00:24:41,147
I see.
