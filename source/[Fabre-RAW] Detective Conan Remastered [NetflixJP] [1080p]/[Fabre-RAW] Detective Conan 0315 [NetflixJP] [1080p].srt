1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,840
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,940
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,040
Bright and warm is the sunshine of April.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,040
Even a surprising case grows rapidly.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,640
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,660
I more or less have an idea of the situation thanks to the telephone call last night

9
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,860
but is Mr. Seizan's slump that bad?

10
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,460
Yes, he hasn't drawn one picture these three months.

11
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,860
Why?

12
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,060
Maybe it has to do with his age since he's already 70,

13
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,960
it seems that he can't come up with anything creative,

14
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,460
and because of pressure from this,

15
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,160
"Jiro Kuroki (28)" -his fingers have begun to shake.

16
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,160
Oh, no!

17
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,660
He hasn't been eating very much lately

18
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,860
and is emotionally unstable.

19
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,460
He has sudden spurts of anger,

20
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,960
while at other times he goes completely silent.

21
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,260
In the end, he went on to attempt suicide.

22
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,560
Yes.

23
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:58,760
"A Place in the Sun"

24
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,960
I asked you to come today in hopes that

25
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,360
Mr. Seizan would feel at least a bit refreshed.

26
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,760
I'm sorry to have called you knowing how busy you are.

27
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,060
Oh, no. Don't be.

28
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,460
If I can be of help to Mr. Seizan who is my drinking friend,

29
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,060
I couldn't be happier.

30
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,860
He would never turn down an offer that comes with Japanese sake

31
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,360
and hot spring, would he, Ran?

32
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,460
You're right.

33
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,660
Just what was that?

34
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,660
But, Mr. Seizan sure is a lucky man,

35
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,560
because he has a kind hearted disciple like you.

36
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,160
I'm what I am, thanks to Mr. Seizan.

37
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,060
Oh, it's a bush warbler!

38
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,260
They reside in this bamboo forest.

39
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,460
I hear them from this side.

40
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,860
Oh, he's...

41
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,760
Mr. Seizan.

42
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,860
"Good friends who travel great distances

43
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,160
just to see you are as precious as gold."

44
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,660
Thanks for stopping by on the way.

45
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,060
When I saw the name of the station,

46
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,060
your face flashed through my mind, so...

47
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,860
I'm glad to see that you seem to be doing very well.

48
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,560
"Seizan Hayakawa (70)" -The older I get the more filled with energy I am.

49
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,060
I was just sketching the bamboo around here now too.

50
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,860
He doesn't look the least bit pressured.

51
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,460
Can't you tell?

52
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,460
He's putting on an act

53
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,760
because he doesn't want you to see his wretched self!

54
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,260
An act.

55
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,860
Did you just see that?

56
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,060
That's called the flight of a bush warbler

57
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,560
from valley to valley.

58
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,360
That's they're cry of warning.

59
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,760
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,960
Please forgive them because they'll fly away in time.

61
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,060
This bamboo forest is a sacred place for the bush warbler

62
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,860
and is not to be infiltrated.

63
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,460
Let's leave them so as not to intrude on them.

64
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,260
"Noriko Yamamoto (35)" -Welcome back, Mr. Seizan.

65
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,560
We've got guests.

66
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,360
Please make them something good to eat.

67
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,760
Yes, sir.

68
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,260
Who is she?

69
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,360
She comes here daily to take care of Mr. Seizan.

70
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,360
Her name is Noriko Yamamoto.

71
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,860
I see.

72
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,060
Mother!

73
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,460
Look... I'm good, aren't I?

74
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,360
Kenichi.

75
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,360
-Noriko... -I'm very sorry!

76
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,260
My mother came down with a sudden fever

77
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,760
and couldn't take care of him so, that's why.

78
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,360
No excuses!

79
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,760
I told you never to bring your child here!

80
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,260
Yes. But, just today.

81
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,360
No! Make him go home!

82
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,160
Don't ever bring him before me again!

83
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,560
Mother...

84
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,860
Go home, right this minute! Understand?

85
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,960
By the way, is that a new piece of work?

86
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,460
Fantastic mountain.

87
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,460
This is Mt. Fuji that I drew recently

88
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,460
because a certain company asked me for it.

89
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,060
Mr. Kuroki, don't you draw?

90
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,160
It's been a while since you've become Mr. Seizan's disciple, isn't it?

91
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,560
Sort of.

92
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,460
I saw it some time ago, but he's pretty good.

93
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,660
Unlike Mr. Seizan's, it's colorful.

94
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,360
Yes, mine are pictures in color.

95
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,160
Come to think of it, you know the contest

96
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,360
that Mr. Seizan serves as a judge?

97
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,460
Isn't it about time it starts?

98
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,960
You know very well, don't you?

99
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,260
The day after tomorrow is the deadline.

100
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,260
Why don't you make an entry, Mr. Kuroki?

101
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,060
I think you'll do pretty good.

102
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,160
Right, Mr. Seizan?

103
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,360
I don't think so.

104
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,860
I, his teacher, Seizan Hayakawa, will be laughed at.

105
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,660
Kuroki's not skilled enough to enter the contest.

106
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,160
But, Mr. Seizan...

107
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,860
Mr. Mouri, it's just as Mr. Seizan says!

108
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,160
I haven't gone through enough training yet.

109
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,060
Right, Ran, would you please be my model?

110
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,460
As part of training for me?

111
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,660
Sure.

112
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,760
Oh, Mr. Kuroki, one minute.

113
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,060
Mr. Seizan, could you draw us a picture?

114
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,360
Mr. Mouri!

115
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,360
When you were in Tokyo,

116
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,460
you used to draw a lot for us to enhance gaiety.

117
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,260
No, not tonight...

118
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,460
Please don't let him.

119
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,560
Mr. Mouri! Mr. Seizan has already drunk liquor.

120
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,960
He used to drink and draw for us in the past too.

121
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,160
Please, Mr. Seizan.

122
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,460
Please!

123
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,060
No good!

124
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,160
I'm sorry, I got carried away and I got kind of pushy.

125
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,560
No, don't be. It's just that I've gotten very weak lately

126
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,960
when it comes to drinking.

127
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
Mr. Seizan!

128
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,460
Why don't we go fishing out at sea tomorrow?

129
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,360
Of course with Mr. Mouri and the others.

130
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,160
That sounds great!

131
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,360
Do let us accompany you, Mr. Seizan!

132
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,460
I haven't gone fishing in a long time.

133
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,260
I wonder if we can fish when it's raining like this?

134
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,360
According to the weather forecast,

135
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,960
the rain is supposed to stop by sunrise,

136
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,360
and it's said that tomorrow will be a hot day.

137
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,860
Well, as for tonight, I guess I'll go hit the sack already.

138
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,860
Good night, Mr. Seizan.

139
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,860
Yeah, good night.

140
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,260
Dad! That's rude, you shouldn't have done it!

141
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,860
Mr. Mouri!

142
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,860
Please don't get me wrong, Mr. Kuroki.

143
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,560
I want to confirm with my own eyes

144
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,660
whether he cannot draw because his fingers are shaking, as you say.

145
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,760
That's why I put on that act.

146
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,260
I see.

147
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,960
So this is your workplace.

148
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,660
How cute. Is this your work?

149
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,660
It's still incomplete, though.

150
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,260
What beautiful colors.

151
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,560
It's drawn by mixing this powdered paint with hide glue.

152
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,060
This white one is called Oyster White, right?

153
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,860
You're knowledgeable, aren't you?

154
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,860
It's made by crushing the shell of oysters

155
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,560
and making them into powder.

156
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,060
Oysters?

157
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,860
What? That picture.

158
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,360
It's a picture of the bush warbler flying from valley to valley.

159
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,860
Good morning!

160
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,860
Oh, Mrs. Yamamoto.

161
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,560
What's wrong? You look pale.

162
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,060
I haven't had much sleep having to look after my mother.

163
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,260
I'm going to go call the doctor and ask him to check on her.

164
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,560
Mr. Mouri!

165
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,860
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

166
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,360
Mr. Seizan hasn't come out of his room yet,

167
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,260
so please go ahead to the harbor.

168
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,560
I see, all right.

169
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,760
What?

170
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,460
You mean Mr. Seizan isn't going to come?

171
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,860
Yes. He says he wants to stay home and relax.

172
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:42,360
Mr. Seizan, I'll switch over to Mr. Mouri now.

173
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,560
Yes.

174
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,760
I'm sorry, but I don't think I'll go today.

175
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,960
Are you all right, Mr. Seizan?

176
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,160
Maybe we should...

177
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,860
Okay, we'll see you by sundown.

178
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,060
Yes.

179
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,360
You can expect a good catch!

180
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,360
Let's not stimulate him too much for now.

181
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
-Octopus! -Amazing!

182
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,860
-Fish! -Great!

183
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,260
-Old boot. -That's not good.

184
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,460
Yes, this is Kuroki.

185
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,060
You mean, Mr. Seizan?

186
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,760
He left a note?

187
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,760
Yes. I can't draw anymore.

188
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,860
I'm sorry for relying on you. Thanks for everything.

189
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,860
Hello, please come back right away.

190
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,060
It seems she found it

191
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,460
when she went to clean up at the usual time.

192
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,860
Please call the police immediately

193
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,660
and have them search for him!

194
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,860
You heard him, didn't you?

195
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,060
We'll head back right away!

196
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,660
Mr. Seizan!

197
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,360
Is it suicide?

198
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,060
Who are you?

199
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,260
I'm a private detective, Kogoro Mouri.

200
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,160
You mean you're the famous...

201
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,960
I'm Daimatsu from the local police station.

202
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,860
We found a death note too,

203
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,260
so it's probably undoubtedly suicide.

204
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,060
He tied a rope to the bamboo,

205
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,660
jumped off from the rock and committed suicide.

206
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,160
The estimated time of his death is

207
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,360
thought to be between 11:00 to 13:00.

208
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,760
He tied the rope to the bamboo just when we were fishing.

209
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,860
I wonder why the bamboo was all cut down?

210
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,660
Water wasn't accumulated

211
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,160
so the bamboo was cut this morning after the rain stopped.

212
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,960
So what?

213
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,760
Go away!

214
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,960
A bush warbler?

215
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:00,060
It's way too soon to conclude this as suicide!

216
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,940
So this is Mr. Seizan's atelier.

217
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,140
Mr. Seizan confined himself in here

218
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,140
and was drawing all the while after that.

219
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,340
Bamboo Diary.

220
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,740
I wonder what this is.

221
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,540
The record of the growth of bamboo.

222
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,740
I see.

223
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,940
If it's like this, then maybe...

224
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,340
Pops.

225
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,940
There are expensive drawings here,

226
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,440
stop scampering around!

227
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,040
Look at this!

228
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,740
This is a sketch of Ran.

229
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,240
What about this?

230
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,340
You see...

231
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,140
What? I see.

232
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,640
Oh, I was just thinking the same thing!

233
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,740
Mr. Mouri, I've finished most of the questioning,

234
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,140
so I'm heading back to the station now.

235
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,540
Please wait.

236
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,640
Isn't it too soon to decide that this is a suicide?

237
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,740
What do you mean?

238
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,840
Mr. Seizan said this yesterday.

239
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,640
This bamboo forest is a sacred place for the bush warbler

240
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,240
and is not to be infiltrated.

241
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,540
I wonder if Mr. Seizan,

242
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,640
would do such a thing as pollute the bamboo forest that he loved

243
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,640
with his corpse?

244
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,340
One more thing!

245
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,140
Last night Mr. Seizan confined himself

246
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,440
to the atelier after dinner

247
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,040
and was drawing this right through.

248
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,940
He was probably planning to give it to us as a gift

249
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,740
at the time we leave here.

250
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,040
If so, I wonder if he would commit suicide.

251
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,640
Which means...

252
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,440
A homicide under the pretense of suicide!

253
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,740
Mr. Seizan said "The bush warbler's flight from valley to valley"

254
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,540
means that the bush warbler's crying is the sound of warning.

255
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,540
Mrs. Yamamoto, just before we met you this morning,

256
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,940
we heard the cry of the bush warbler!

257
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:22,540
And, you ran off with a pale face.

258
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,540
I'll bet you were at the bamboo forest then?

259
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,640
No!

260
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,340
That is...

261
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,140
Conan.

262
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,740
But, his estimated time of death

263
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,940
is between 11 am to 1 pm.

264
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,240
She has an alibi during that time.

265
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,340
What?

266
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,840
I was at the city hospital.

267
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,340
I was told that I should take my mother to a large hospital.

268
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,340
So I took her there.

269
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,640
I see.

270
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,440
What's the matter, Conan?

271
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,440
Mr. Kuroki's painting is completed!

272
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,940
Mr. Kuroki must've stayed up last night and completed it.

273
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:15,540
Ran, Pops says to bring that painting and the sketch.

274
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,440
-When? -Right now!

275
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,640
I see.

276
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,440
She was by her mother's side all the time.

277
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,640
I understand.

278
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,740
You seem to have a definite alibi.

279
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:32,740
Which means it's most likely that Mr. Seizan committed suicide then.

280
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,940
I guess I'll be going then.

281
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,340
Officer Daimatsu, please wait!

282
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,940
Mr. Seizan did not commit suicide!

283
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,040
What?

284
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,940
The motive of the killer

285
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,240
who committed this homicide and made it look like a suicide

286
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,240
can be found in the pictures that Ran has brought here!

287
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,340
Mr. Kuroki, you were planning to enter the contest

288
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:07,540
with this painting, which deadline is tomorrow, right?

289
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,740
But Mr. Seizan wouldn't let you.

290
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,240
Therefore, you decided to kill him.

291
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,340
Mr. Mouri, what a thing to say out of the blue.

292
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,640
You invited me to come here saying that Mr. Seizan

293
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,840
was in a grave slump,

294
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,340
and wanted me to come to cheer him up,

295
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,740
but that was a lie!

296
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,440
Mr. Seizan was not in a slump

297
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,840
nor did he have any reason to commit suicide.

298
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,340
But his fingers were shaking.

299
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,040
I guess that's true.

300
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,040
But that painting of Mt. Fuji that was in the guest room.

301
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,140
How do you explain that?

302
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:50,340
Mr. Seizan said, "I just finished drawing it a few days ago".

303
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,140
That's probably what you completed

304
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,640
using Mr. Seizan's rough draft.

305
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,740
No, not only that.

306
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,140
Weren't you the one who was drawing

307
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,440
all of Mr. Seizan's paintings these past few years?

308
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,540
No way...

309
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,940
So, having you enter the contest

310
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,440
and going independent was totally absurd

311
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,740
as far as Mr. Seizan was concerned.

312
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,740
Last night, you suddenly asked Ran to be your model

313
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,640
and diverted my attention.

314
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,540
I see! He knew that you would try to test Mr. Seizan

315
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,740
and ask him to draw!

316
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:37,140
Right, and after seeing Mr. Seizan's condition,

317
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,840
Mr. Kuroki, I believed that you said,

318
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,440
"It's not surprising that Mr. Seizan would commit suicide".

319
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,540
By the way, Mr. Kuroki, early this morning,

320
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,140
you carried Mr. Seizan's body to the bamboo forest

321
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,440
where he was found, didn't you?

322
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,440
No! You talked to Mr. Seizan on the phone, didn't you?

323
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,840
That's an entry level trick!

324
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,540
You recorded Mr. Seizan's voice beforehand,

325
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:08,640
and set the voice that you edited on the answer phone.

326
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,040
But like I've kept telling you time and again,

327
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,440
I have an alibi.

328
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,840
You mean, you were at sea with us?

329
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,440
Ran, please show Officer Daimatsu the sketchbook Conan gave you.

330
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,740
Here you go.

331
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,940
Bamboos grow way faster than we imagine them too.

332
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,040
Very true.

333
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,240
Please show us how much they have grown in a period of three days.

334
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,540
About 2m.

335
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,840
Amazing.

336
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,840
Bamboos grow greatly at once,

337
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,940
when like this morning after the rain clears

338
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,440
and the temperature rises.

339
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:52,440
Mr. Kuroki, you took advantage of this and killed Mr. Seizan!

340
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,540
This morning you carried Mr. Seizan

341
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,340
who you put to sleep with sleeping pills to the bamboo forest.

342
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,040
You made Mr. Seizan sit in front of a bamboo you chose

343
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,640
and put a rope around his neck.

344
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,140
Then you cut the bamboo that was around Mr. Seizan.

345
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,040
You made sure that a lot of sun would shine

346
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,940
on the bamboo that you tied the rope onto.

347
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,540
The cry of the bush warblers we heard this morning,

348
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:29,540
was the cry of warning aimed at you, Mr. Kuroki.

349
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:33,940
The bamboo that was showered with a lot of sunshine grew rapidly

350
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,240
and eventually suspended Mr. Seizan in the air.

351
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,840
This is how Mr. Seizan died

352
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,640
while we were out fishing with you, Mr. Kuroki.

353
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,140
The white sawdust on your socks is the evidence!

354
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,940
This is Oyster White.

355
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,540
Just what kind of evidence is this?

356
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,540
No, that's not Oyster White.

357
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,740
Please take a good look.

358
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,040
That's sawdust that fell on you

359
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,040
when you cut the bamboo!

360
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,540
I'm sorry.

361
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,240
It's just as you say.

362
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,040
I've been drawing on behalf of Mr. Seizan

363
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,940
since a few years ago.

364
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,840
But I wanted to sign my name on them

365
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,140
instead of Mr. Seizan's at least once.

366
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,640
I want to give my paintings a place in the sun at least once.

367
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,040
I wanted somebody to look at them.

368
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,340
So I...

369
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,340
"Mouri Detective Agency"

370
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,840
All right. It's done.

371
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,240
Really?

372
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,740
Let me see...

373
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,540
What's that supposed to be?

374
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:38,840
You idiot! Don't you know about realism?

375
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,940
It's nothing more than a child's doodling!

376
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,040
What?

377
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,340
Even Conan can draw way better than this, right, Conan?

378
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,640
Don't compare me with a brat like him!

379
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,140
I'm just telling you the truth.

380
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,240
You have no sense for this piece of artwork!

381
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,540
I'm glad that I don't.

382
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,300
Next Conan's Hint:

383
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,980
"Hidden camera"

384
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,920
The stage of the next episode is a square jungle!

385
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,200
A tiger pro wrestler.

386
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,680
Striped pants?
