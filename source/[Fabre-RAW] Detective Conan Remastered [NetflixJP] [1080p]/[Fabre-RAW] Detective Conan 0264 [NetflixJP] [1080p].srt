1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,570
What lies in one's heart is a mystery to us all.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,570
Star and snow glitter on the two.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,270
The confrontation of this couple.

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,370
What's going to happen in the court?

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,870
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,670
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,770
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,080
"The Tokyo District Court"

9
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,480
Thank you so much for everything.

10
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,880
It's all thanks to you.

11
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,080
No, it's nothing. No problem.

12
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,980
Mr. Okada.

13
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,980
I'm sure that many things may come up from now too,

14
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,180
but hang in there, okay?

15
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,280
I will.

16
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,980
Terumitsu, it's time we go now.

17
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,680
I guess so. Goodbye then.

18
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,780
Goodbye. Take care.

19
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,280
Mother.

20
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,980
Did you win the case again, mother?

21
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,580
I'm not the one who won, he did.

22
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,880
All I did was help him out.

23
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,180
I'm sorry, Ran.

24
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,680
You waited quite a while, didn't you?

25
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,980
Quite a bit.

26
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,780
So, Conan suggested that

27
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,380
we'll have you take us to a great meal.

28
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,580
Hey!

29
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,680
The thing is

30
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,780
I've got some sudden business to attend to from now.

31
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,680
-What? -I'm sorry.

32
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,980
I promise I'll make it up to you.

33
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,180
Ms. Kisaki, the car's ready for you outside.

34
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,480
Thank you. Oh, right! Ms. Kuriyama.

35
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,880
Would you please take Ran and Conan

36
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,280
to eat something good after this?

37
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,280
Oh, Ms. Kisaki.

38
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,080
Ms. Kujo.

39
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,580
I heard that

40
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,380
you decided to serve as attorney for Shinji Usami

41
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,780
Yes. I was planning on going to see you in the near future.

42
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,380
Ms. Kuriyama, who is she?

43
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:19,380
She is Reiko Kujo, ace Madonna of the Tokyo prosecutors squad.

44
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,880
She is in charge of the case

45
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,280
that Ms. Kisaki is handling now.

46
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,880
I see.

47
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,480
So, she's the famous Madonna of the prosecutor's squad.

48
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,680
I'm really looking forward

49
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,480
to meeting you in court, Ms. Kisaki.

50
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,680
Take it easy on me, okay?

51
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,080
You took the words right out of my mouth. Same to you.

52
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,980
Let's both give it our best shot.

53
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,080
Goodbye, then.

54
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,080
It seems that she's won a succession of cases again.

55
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,280
I see.

56
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,080
That's all about to end now.

57
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,380
I'm going to teach her how failure tastes.

58
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,280
"Battle in Court, Kisaki vs. Kogoro (Part 1)"

59
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,430
I tell you that mother of mine,

60
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,030
all she ever has in mind is work.

61
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,530
Ms. Kuriyama.

62
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,030
What kind of case did Ran's mother take on?

63
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,430
Huh?

64
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,030
Do you remember the case about a month ago,

65
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,230
where a corpse of a man was found

66
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,830
at a construction site in Haido-cho?

67
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,430
The victim was an office worker called Tsuyoshi Hirasawa.

68
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,430
It was found that he was hit on the head with a steel pipe

69
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,330
that was found at the site and died.

70
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,830
And a suspect emerged from a car key

71
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,130
that was found at the site.

72
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,730
And he's the one that Ms. Kisaki will be defending this time.

73
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:56,030
And, what does the prosecutor think his motive is?

74
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,930
Well, the thing is,

75
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,730
three years ago, the victim, Mr. Hirasawa, who was drunk

76
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:05,730
accidentally pushed Mr. Usami child off the stairs.

77
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,030
The boy, Masaki, hit his head hard

78
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,130
and died because of the incident.

79
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,030
How terrible.

80
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,630
Hirasawa was most naturally charge

81
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,130
for involuntary manslaughter

82
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,630
but at the time of the incident, being that he was drunk,

83
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,330
a suspended sentence was passed.

84
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,030
That's absurd!

85
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:33,030
He killed a person and he doesn't have to go to jail?

86
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,530
Give me back Masaki!

87
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,130
Give me back my Masaki!

88
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:43,230
The prosecutors think that Usami killed Mr. Hirasawa

89
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,030
in order to avenge the death of his son.

90
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,730
I kind of feel sorry for him.

91
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,830
And, what is Mr. Usami saying to this?

92
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,230
Well, he says he doesn't remember because he was drunk.

93
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:04,130
"Tokyo Prison"

94
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,130
You look well.

95
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,030
Please sit down.

96
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,030
Well, have your remembered anything since then?

97
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,430
"Shinji Usami"

98
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,030
No, nothing.

99
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:28,330
Okay, then let me start from the beginning and ask you again.

100
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,930
On the day of the incident at around 20:30,

101
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,130
you got into an argument with the victim

102
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,430
at a Japanese pub called "Yamazen".

103
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,230
I coincidentally ran into him that day

104
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,330
and got into an argument about the past.

105
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,430
The problem is after that.

106
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,230
The estimated time of murder of the victim

107
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,830
at the construction site is between 21:30 to 22:00.

108
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:53,930
The point is where and what you were doing during that time.

109
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,730
I don't care how trivial,

110
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,130
if you remember anything, I'd like you to tell me about it.

111
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,330
By the way, about your wife,

112
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,330
I can't get a hold of her

113
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,230
no matter how many times I try calling her.

114
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,130
She has nothing to do with this!

115
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,430
Why not?

116
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,330
Even if you're divorced, she's your ex-wife.

117
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,230
I'm sure she's worried about you.

118
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,930
She hates me.

119
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,630
She doesn't give a darn what happens to me.

120
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,930
"Business Association Haido Yokocho"

121
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,530
Ms. Kisaki.

122
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,430
Ms. Kuriyama.

123
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,330
Well? Find anything?

124
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,330
According to the police,

125
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,830
it should be somewhere around here.

126
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,930
Mother, over here!

127
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,030
Ran? What brings you here?

128
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,430
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,830
She insisted on coming along and search together with Conan.

130
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,330
What?

131
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,430
You shouldn't be in a place like this,

132
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,630
at this hour of the day.

133
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,930
Isn't this the shop you're looking for?

134
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,930
Is this the shop of the victim's wife?

135
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,030
Mimasu, written "beautiful seat",

136
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,930
this is the place!

137
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,630
What an unusual name.

138
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:30,430
"Masako Kameda"

139
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:41,530
I've already forgotten all about him.

140
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:46,430
I've heard of why you got a divorce.

141
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,830
But, Ms. Kameda...

142
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,230
"It's your fault that Masaki died."

143
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,130
"Why didn't you die instead of him?"

144
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,730
Every time he got drunk, he would repeat saying so.

145
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,730
I understand how you feel.

146
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,730
However, your husband is in a very tough situation now.

147
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,530
Please cooperate with us to help him and talk to us.

148
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,130
I don't want to recall a thing about him.

149
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,630
The construction site where the incident took place

150
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,830
is near here, isn't it?

151
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,630
If there is something that you knew

152
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,630
about the night the incident happened...

153
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,030
I know nothing.

154
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,030
If that's all you want to talk about, please leave.

155
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,130
Welcome!

156
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,930
Huh?

157
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,830
Dad!

158
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,430
What are you guys doing in a place like this?

159
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,430
Talk for yourself.

160
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,430
I just came to take a light shot like always.

161
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,730
Do you know them?

162
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,830
Well, you see...

163
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,130
I'll come again some other time!

164
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,430
Does he come here often?

165
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:06,430
Yes. Mr. Mouri comes here frequently.

166
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,430
Come to think of it, he was here that night, too.

167
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,630
Huh?

168
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,030
That night? Are you referring to the night of the incident?

169
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,830
Do you know something about that incident?

170
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,430
That night, my husband...

171
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,730
Usami came here.

172
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,230
Mr. Usami came to this shop?

173
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,430
Yes.

174
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,330
You're sure that it was the night the incident happened?

175
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:43,930
That night was the only night that Usami ever came here.

176
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,330
Ms. Kisaki.

177
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:51,330
Do you remember what time Mr. Usami came here?

178
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,930
No, I don't.

179
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:57,530
But Mr. Mouri may remember.

180
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,730
Huh? You mean, him?

181
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,430
Thank you so much for remembering.

182
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,830
It's not that I tried to remember for Usami's sake.

183
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,330
I'm finally starting to see some light here.

184
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,990
"Mouri Detective Agency"

185
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,590
-I'm home! -Dad!

186
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,990
What is it, Ran?

187
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,290
You're still up?

188
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,190
Where were you drinking at this late at night?

189
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,690
It's none of your business.

190
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,990
Gosh, you're really starting to act like Eri now days.

191
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,090
If you've got gripes,

192
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,790
why don't you tell her directly yourself?

193
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,190
You haven't changed at all.

194
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,190
It's none of your business!

195
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,290
You smell like alcohol!

196
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,590
Here goes poison gas light beam attack!

197
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,290
-Cut it out! -What a kid.

198
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,990
Never mind, I've got something I want to ask you.

199
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,490
My bust, waist and hip sizes are a secret.

200
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,290
Do you remember that murder case

201
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,290
that occurred at the construction site at Haido-cho?

202
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,190
Come to think of it, yeah.

203
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,490
You were at the pub called Mimasu that night, weren't you?

204
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,590
I don't remember every little detail like that.

205
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,490
Here, drink some coffee and clear your head.

206
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:32,590
I'm sober now that I've seen her face!

207
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,290
That's just great.

208
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,390
Do you remember him?

209
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:45,490
I've seen this guy. I'm sure at Mimasu.

210
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,490
Will you tell me the details?

211
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,290
Well...

212
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,690
I fell asleep after getting drunk at Mimasu.

213
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,490
Mr. Mouri, you have a phone call.

214
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,790
Mr. Mouri...

215
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:05,090
Hello? Mouri here.

216
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,590
Hello?

217
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,690
I can't hear too well in the shop.

218
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,890
No doubt about it. He's the guy I saw back then.

219
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,090
Are you sure?

220
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,790
What's this? You don't believe me?

221
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,890
That's not what I'm saying.

222
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,590
Pops, you just took a glimpse of him

223
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,590
and you remember him that clearly?

224
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:35,390
A renown detective does not forget a face he once sees!

225
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,690
What I'd like to say,

226
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,290
but when I finished taking the phone call

227
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,590
and returned to the shop, he was sitting at the counter.

228
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,190
Gosh.

229
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,690
Are you done with your call?

230
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,190
Well, it seems to have been a wrong number call.

231
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,290
He doesn't look familiar.

232
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,490
He's an old acquaintance.

233
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,090
Well, I guess I better be going.

234
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:21,890
Come on, why don't you take it easy a while longer, Mr. Mouri?

235
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,290
Here, this drink is on the house.

236
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,590
On the house?

237
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,490
Okay.

238
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,090
I guess I'll take another shot, then!

239
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,690
He went home after about 30 minutes

240
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,890
when I left the shop after him,

241
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:39,990
there were a lot of police cars

242
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,390
and the vicinity was boisterous.

243
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:45,190
Something about a murder at a nearby construction site.

244
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,090
Do you remember about

245
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:50,390
what time that person came to the shop?

246
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,090
21:25.

247
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:56,190
Huh? How can you be so sure?

248
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:59,490
I just told you. I'm a renown detective.

249
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:02,490
You looked at the time on your cell phone, right?

250
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,090
Shut up!

251
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,890
What time was Mr. Hirasawa killed?

252
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,590
His estimated time of death

253
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,490
is assumed to be between 21:30 and 22:00.

254
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:17,390
So, if Mr. Usami came to the shop at 21:25,

255
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,290
he has an alibi.

256
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,690
Right.

257
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,990
That's only if we can count on what Kogoro is telling us.

258
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,890
What's this? Are you doubting what I'm saying?

259
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,290
Of course!

260
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,790
You were drinking at that time, weren't you?

261
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,190
How dare you!

262
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,690
I'm back.

263
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,590
Welcome back, mom.

264
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,490
You've both come here, I see.

265
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:50,990
-Hello, Ms. Kisaki. -Hello, Conan.

266
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,590
I was going to bring dad here too,

267
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,890
but he ran away.

268
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,290
Is that so?

269
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:02,090
Ms. Kisaki. Did the defendant remember

270
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,290
that he went to his wife's shop?

271
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,290
All he keeps on saying is

272
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,790
that he doesn't remember anything after having left the shop.

273
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,890
Which means that there is no way

274
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,990
to make up for the time he lost.

275
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,790
The time he lost?

276
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,690
After looking at the time schedule of this case,

277
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,790
Conan is making weird remarks.

278
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,990
Mr. Usami left the pub together with Mr. Hirasawa

279
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,590
at around 20:30, right?

280
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:31,190
And Pops saw Mr. Usami at Mimasu at 21:25.

281
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,490
It takes roughly 15 minutes

282
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,190
to go from the pub to Mimasu.

283
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,990
Therefore, he'll get to Mimasu at around 20:45.

284
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,190
I see.

285
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,590
So, 40 minutes is unaccounted for...

286
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,690
I was just wondering what he would want to do

287
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,290
for 40 minutes with a person

288
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,390
that he hates to the point of wanting to murder him.

289
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:56,390
And it's about Mr. Mouri...

290
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,690
No need to worry about him.

291
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,190
He won't do something as stupid

292
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,090
as to deny the testimony just to stand against me.

293
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,990
The victim was at his ex-wife's shop?

294
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,190
Yes.

295
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,390
It seems that he had an alibi for the day of the incident

296
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:25,690
and his attorney is looking for witnesses to prove this.

297
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,890
Even if his attorney were to insist on his alibi,

298
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,490
if the witness is his ex-wife, it'll lack credibility.

299
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,790
But Kogoro Mouri is also on their list of witnesses.

300
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,990
Something about he having run into the defendant,

301
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,590
who appeared at his ex-wife's shop.

302
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,290
Oh, I see.

303
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:54,190
If I'm not mistaken,

304
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,490
Kogoro Mouri is Attorney Kisaki's husband, isn't he?

305
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,190
Yes, although they're not living with each other now.

306
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,390
This is getting to be quite interesting.

307
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,890
Dad.

308
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,790
Make sure you testify for mom's sake, okay?

309
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,690
Like I've been telling you,

310
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,690
if she comes and begs me to do it for her,

311
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,790
I'll do what need be.

312
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,590
-Dad! -Oh, boy.

313
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,090
Here, have some oden.

314
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,990
Thank you.

315
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,590
Huh? There's octopus in here.

316
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,390
That's called iidako and it seems that

317
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,690
the people in the Kanto area don't usually put it in,

318
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:30,890
but it's really delicious.

319
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,690
Really?

320
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,640
Yeah! It's really delicious!

321
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,740
Kid, after you finish eating, go on home, understand?

322
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,940
That's the sound off your cell phone, isn't it, dad?

323
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,340
-Could you get that, Mama? -Yes, yes.

324
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,640
-Here you are. -Thank you.

325
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,640
Hello, who is it?

326
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,440
Huh? You're...

327
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,740
Does pops always hang his coat there?

328
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,840
Right, so that it doesn't get dirty.

329
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,040
So, he did so that night too.

330
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,840
Wait a sec! If so...

331
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,040
Hey, you guys.

332
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,040
Hurry and go on home.

333
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,040
But we're not done talking yet!

334
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,440
Who cares! Kids time is over,

335
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,940
it's adult time!

336
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,040
Hurry on and go on home!

337
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,740
Dad!

338
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,340
How rude.

339
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,540
Huh?

340
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,040
What's the matter, Conan?

341
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,740
I wonder if the call he just got was from her?

342
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,740
She was, if I remember correctly... the prosecutor.

343
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,240
Welcome!

344
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,740
I've been waiting for you!

345
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,340
I wonder what she wants with dad?

346
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,740
Beats me.

347
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,440
We will now begin the first trial

348
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,640
of defendant Shinji Usami.

349
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,640
First of all, will the prosecutor please read the indictment?

350
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,740
The defendant Shinji Usami,

351
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,840
permanent address at Daigaku Tsubonouchi

352
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,240
Shimo Kasuya-gun, Yamanashi Prefecture.

353
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,240
The defendant, Shinji Usami in Heisei...

354
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,340
Is this all the witness the prosecutor submitted?

355
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,240
Yes. It's more or less what we expected.

356
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,940
Therefore, according to Criminal code provision 199,

357
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,540
we intend to file charges for homicide.

358
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,040
A real trial really can get you nervous, can't it?

359
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,140
Yeah.

360
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,040
We will begin questioning the witness now.

361
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,340
Your honor.

362
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,140
What is it, prosecutor?

363
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,940
Before starting,

364
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,140
we would like to summon a new witness from our side.

365
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,240
He manages a detective agency

366
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,440
and is known as the Sleeping Kogoro,

367
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,540
Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

368
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,440
What's going on, Ms. Kisaki?

369
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,240
I wonder. I don't have the slightest idea.

370
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,640
How come dad's serving as witness for the prosecutor?

371
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,640
Just as I thought.

372
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,940
Does the defense have anything to say?

373
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,140
As you think proper is fine.

374
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,640
We shall summon Mr. Kogoro Mouri as witness then.

375
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,540
What is she up to anyway

376
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,540
dragging him out to a place like this?

377
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:13,540
I will give you a gift of your first taste of failure soon.

378
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,040
Madonna is aware of that, after all.

379
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,840
If so, then she may just win this trial.

380
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,140
Looks really bad, Ms. Kisaki.

381
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,320
Next Conan's Hint:

382
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,060
"Matches"

383
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,820
Next time, everything will be resolved!

384
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,660
You mean between mom and dad?

385
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:42,060
Well, this...
