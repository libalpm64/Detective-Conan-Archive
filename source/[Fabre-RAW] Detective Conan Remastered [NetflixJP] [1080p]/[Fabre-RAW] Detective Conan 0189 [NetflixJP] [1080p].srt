1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,140
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,140
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,240
The Youth Detective Squad are trapped in the cave.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,940
And there's the question of Conan's blood type.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,440
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,690
We, the Youth Detective Squad went on a camping trip

9
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,790
with Doctor Agasa.

10
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,290
And we found a limestone cave.

11
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:08,390
We quickly decided to go inside and explore it,

12
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:12,290
but we come across some men carrying a dead body.

13
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,890
And on top of that, I...

14
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,790
-Why you... -Get down!

15
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,690
I got shot and suffered a severe injury.

16
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,490
Footsteps?

17
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,090
Oh, no! Those guys are coming!

18
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,290
What should we do?

19
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,990
"Perilous Return: The Wounded Detective"

20
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,690
Darn it! Which one did they go into?

21
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:56,690
Don't worry about it.

22
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,690
One of the kids is hurt, they won't be moving so fast.

23
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,690
We'll go after them,

24
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,890
so you just stand guard here.

25
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,290
Okay, I've got you.

26
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,990
Why did we come in a place like this?

27
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,690
It's not my fault.

28
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,590
I thought these were paths, so I picked the farthest one.

29
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,890
How could I know they were just holes?

30
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,490
Don't fight.

31
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,190
We've got to find the dragon's path that Conan told us about

32
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,890
or we're going to be killed.

33
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,890
By ourselves, without Conan?

34
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,690
You've got to be kidding.

35
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,990
I'm not kidding!

36
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,490
He's not budging.

37
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,890
That's strange.

38
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,890
If he move,

39
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,890
it'd give us the perfect chance to escape.

40
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,090
We can't wait for that to happen.

41
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,590
Besides, his friends could come back at anytime.

42
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,390
We've got to get out of this cave as soon as possible

43
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,790
so we can get Conan to a hospital.

44
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,690
Yes, you're right.

45
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:06,890
Let's look for the dragon's path Conan said would lead us out.

46
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,190
There are five openings.

47
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,990
The guard is in front of the rock egg

48
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,690
and we're right here.

49
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,090
Since this is just a hole and doesn't go anywhere,

50
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,890
the dragon's path must be in one of the other four openings.

51
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,890
The dragon's path. Dragon...

52
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,090
Hey, wait a minute!

53
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,890
The word dragon starts with the letter "D", doesn't it?

54
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,590
It's the fourth letter in the alphabet.

55
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,490
You mean the forth opening is the dragon's path?

56
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,790
That's right!

57
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,990
The forth from the entrance.

58
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,990
It's the one we're in right now.

59
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,690
You're kidding.

60
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,490
You know, Conan was mumbling something from behind me.

61
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,490
-Huh? -Huh?

62
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,490
I'm pretty sure he said the key words were...

63
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,490
"to", "dragon", and "egg". Something like that.

64
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,090
Why didn't you tell us that earlier?

65
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,990
-You idiot! -Huh?

66
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,990
Oh, no. He's coming this way.

67
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,290
Hey! Didn't I tell you to keep a look out here?

68
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,190
Did you found those kids?

69
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,890
Nope, the first opening was a dead end.

70
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,590
Don't worry about it.

71
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,290
There's four more, we'll find them soon enough.

72
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,790
The kids might double back here,

73
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,890
-so keep your eyes open. -Okay.

74
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,390
So the keywords are "to", "dragon" and "egg".

75
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,690
It doesn't make any sense.

76
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,890
If the dragon were a snake,

77
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,190
eggs would be their favorite food.

78
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,390
Snake?

79
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,390
My grandmother who lives in the country told me.

80
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,790
She was born in the year of the snake so she studied them.

81
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,590
Year of the snake?

82
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,490
That's it! I'm sure of it!

83
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:08,190
"To", "dragon" and "egg" pertain to the Chinese zodiac.

84
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,490
Dragon means year of the dragon,

85
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,790
egg means year of the snake!

86
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,890
Then, what about "to"?

87
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:16,390
It probably means year of the tiger (tora) or chicken (ton).

88
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,590
If we put the egg into the snake's position,

89
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,290
the five openings and their pertaining zodiac symbols

90
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,490
will be like this...

91
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,590
Year of the dragon, which is the dragon's path

92
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,890
is right next to the egg...

93
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:29,690
But isn't that the opening those killers said was a dead end?

94
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,690
And besides, I think year of the chicken

95
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,690
is better suited for the word egg.

96
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:39,790
But then the meaning will overlap with the word "to".

97
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,890
Maybe it's pointing to the year of the rabbit.

98
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,090
The character for rabbit

99
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,890
looks a lot like the character for egg.

100
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,590
But it's the chicken that lays eggs.

101
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,190
I think "to", "dragon" and "egg"

102
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,690
aren't referring to the zodiac after all.

103
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,090
So the only other common denominator

104
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,290
is they're all written in one character.

105
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,890
What are you talking about?

106
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,790
Egg is two characters, isn't it?

107
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,490
I went to a restaurant close to where I live

108
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,890
and I read "tamagoyaki" as "ohji-yak".

109
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,890
And everybody, even mom laughed at me,

110
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,190
that's why I'll never forget the word.

111
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,690
And "tamago" is sometimes written as "tama-no-ko", too.

112
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,290
Right?

113
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,990
Hey, just wait a minute!

114
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,290
You know, it could be...

115
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,290
It has something to do with "shogi" (chess).

116
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,890
Huh?

117
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,190
"To" is in back of the pawn

118
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,190
and dragon is in back of the rook.

119
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,990
And just like Genta said,

120
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,090
the character for egg could be

121
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,290
the one he mentioned which would stand for "gyokusho".

122
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,990
What is "gyokusho"?

123
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,290
In chess,

124
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,090
it's the king with the lower score uses.

125
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,790
What I'm saying is, if the egg

126
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,690
is referring to the position of the king,

127
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,890
the five openings would be ranked

128
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,390
according to their proximity to the egg.

129
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,990
Thus, they would be "kinsho", "ginsho",

130
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,590
"keima", "kosha",

131
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,290
the opening in front of the "keima"

132
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,090
would be the path of the rook and...

133
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,990
What about the dragon's path?

134
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:05,590
The opening diagonally in front of it is the way out.

135
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,190
But what are we going to do?

136
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:14,490
We can't get to that one without passing in front of that man.

137
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,090
That is a problem.

138
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,890
The only weapons we have

139
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:21,490
is our watch shaped flashlights and our badges.

140
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,590
Our badges?

141
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,790
If I remember right, Conan...

142
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,190
Listen!

143
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,890
I don't know if it'll work, but...

144
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,790
Here goes...

145
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,490
Take that!

146
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,990
Idiot kids!

147
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,290
Do you think you can knock me out with those rocks?

148
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,090
Now! Let's go!

149
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,590
Hey, what's going on?

150
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,790
It's those kids!

151
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,690
They went into that opening.

152
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,090
I'll teach them! They won't get away from me!

153
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,390
It's the exit!

154
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,990
-Genta! -I've got you!

155
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,890
Okay, you two! Don't step outside and get back in here.

156
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,890
Come on! Hurry it up!

157
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,090
I'll shoot him in the head if you don't!

158
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,090
That's right, good kiddies.

159
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,490
This is the police!

160
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,990
You're completely surrounded!

161
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,590
Throw down your guns and come out with your hands up!

162
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,090
I repeat! You are completely surrounded!

163
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,890
Darn it.

164
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,490
You fools! Don't you see what I have?

165
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,790
If you don't want me to shoot this kid,

166
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,490
you'd better let me through!

167
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:54,890
You idiot.

168
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,890
I've already read your next move.

169
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,990
What?

170
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,290
Play it smart.

171
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,790
That's how the three robbers were caught

172
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,690
and our cave exploration came to an end.

173
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,390
It was Doctor Agasa and Haibara that notified the police.

174
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,590
They figured we'd be heading for the cave's exit.

175
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,190
So they talked to the local people and found out about this exit.

176
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,390
And they'd just arrived to stake it out.

177
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,390
According to this local man,

178
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,490
that mysterious sign has been around for ages.

179
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,290
And no one knows for sure who wrote it.

180
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,090
My consciousness started to slip

181
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,090
as I listened to the conversation.

182
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,890
And I was taken to the Beika General Hospital.

183
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,890
What? Surgery?

184
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,290
Wasn't it just a scratch?

185
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,790
Well, you see...

186
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,390
He was shot.

187
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,390
What?

188
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:01,090
The bullet passed through the abdomen on the left side,

189
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,790
but there was a lot of bleeding

190
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:06,290
and there is a possibility of kidney damage.

191
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,290
He's in a very serious condition.

192
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,590
Conan!

193
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,890
Conan, hang in there!

194
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,490
You'll be fine in a little while!

195
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,290
Doctor, we have a problem!

196
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,290
The previous patient we operated on

197
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,690
has this boy's blood type.

198
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,990
And we used up almost all the blood we had in stock!

199
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,190
What?

200
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,090
Even if we call the blood bank now,

201
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,590
we'll never get it in time!

202
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,090
Excuse me.

203
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,790
You can use my blood.

204
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:47,490
I have the same blood type as him.

205
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,290
Hey, how do you know that?

206
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,290
But you'd better check to make sure.

207
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,390
Then, let's hurry and get you tested.

208
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,890
Yes, madam!

209
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,590
Ran, I knew it.

210
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,790
So...

211
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,490
you did know...

212
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,290
Shinichi.

213
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,480
Well, it looks like I'm still alive.

214
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,780
It hurts.

215
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,680
I guess I'm a pretty obstinate guy.

216
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,280
Ran.

217
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,680
You owe her your life.

218
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,480
She gave you 400cc of her own blood,

219
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,580
and she stayed up all night watching you.

220
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,780
Good grief.

221
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:25,880
You're lucky you and Ran just happened to have the same blood type.

222
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,980
If you had a rare blood type, you wouldn't be here today.

223
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,780
You'd be in the next world.

224
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,480
Excuse me. You can use my blood.

225
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,880
I have the same blood type as him.

226
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,780
No, it wasn't a guess.

227
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,080
Ran knew for sure.

228
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,080
She knew my blood type.

229
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,680
She knows who I am.

230
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,480
Hey!

231
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,380
Ran gave you a whole lot of her blood.

232
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,780
You'd better recover fast or I won't forgive you.

233
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,580
Yes, sir.

234
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,980
"10 days later"

235
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,880
Are you sure?

236
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,980
Yes!

237
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,780
There was no damage to any major organ

238
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,180
and he's healing very well.

239
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,680
At this rate, he'll be able to check out within two or three days,

240
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,780
I'm sure of it.

241
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,280
That's wonderful!

242
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,180
But after the operation, his resistance is low.

243
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,180
And it appears he has an infection in his upper respiratory tract.

244
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,780
An upper respiratory tract infection?

245
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,480
Don't worry, it's just a cold.

246
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,180
See! Didn't I tell you this game is nice?

247
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,480
It's really popular at school.

248
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,680
There, go there!

249
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,080
Go left there!

250
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,480
That's enough.

251
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,380
Play time is over!

252
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,980
The patient is to return straight to his room.

253
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,680
As for you kids, it's getting late so go on home.

254
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,680
I'm sorry, guys.

255
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,880
See you, Conan!

256
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,080
Bye!

257
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,780
-See you! -We'll see you at school!

258
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,880
They said you could leave in two or three days,

259
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,680
our school's having the school festival then.

260
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,080
Three days from today, that's the day we have our play.

261
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,380
What are you going to do?

262
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,780
You can't pick him up since you'll be busy all morning.

263
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,780
Don't worry, I'll ask dad to do it.

264
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,980
By the way, did you get a hold of "you-know-who"?

265
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,280
Who's that?

266
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,980
Shinichi, of course!

267
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,980
If he finds out you're playing the lead,

268
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,980
I'm sure he'll come flying!

269
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,480
He won't come.

270
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,280
Besides, it doesn't matter to me anyway.

271
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,880
I'll be happy just having Conan get better

272
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,280
and coming to see the play.

273
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,480
You will come, won't you?

274
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,080
Sure.

275
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,980
What is this?

276
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,680
You two are acting so lovey-dovey.

277
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,580
Ran, don't tell me you're switching from Shinichi to this kid?

278
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,780
Don't be silly! That's ridiculous!

279
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,880
Hey.

280
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,080
Sonoko, what happened to your wrist?

281
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,580
You mean this?

282
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,080
I sprained it during rehearsal,

283
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,380
and I can't play the knight's part.

284
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,080
But you're lucky someone that nice offered to take your place.

285
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,180
Who's that?

286
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,980
You know, Mr. Arade, the teacher I told you about.

287
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,180
I hate to admit, but he's awfully good at it, too.

288
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,480
And that love scene with Ran is something.

289
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,180
Sonoko!

290
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,080
And if Ran can keep a cool head in front of all those people,

291
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,080
the play will be perfect!

292
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,080
Don't worry.

293
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,780
The cooler in the gym is broken and it'll be like a sauna inside.

294
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,880
Besides, there wasn't much of a crowd last year either.

295
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,880
I'll bet that scrawny guy planned things to work out this way.

296
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,080
Didn't you know that things will be different this year?

297
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,780
The drama club is putting up a stand in the gym,

298
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,380
they're going to sell cold drinks.

299
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,680
Oh, no! I don't believe it!

300
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,680
What in the world were you thinking of?

301
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,180
Why did you go and buy lilies?

302
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,780
Why don't you just shut up?

303
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,480
Flowers are flowers. What's the difference?

304
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,980
Aren't those voices coming from Conan's room?

305
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,380
You're right.

306
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,780
That voice, it couldn't be...

307
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,480
You fool! Lilies have a strong smell,

308
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,080
so some people don't like them.

309
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,280
You don't buy them for people in the hospital.

310
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,180
Why didn't you tell me that before, you idiot?

311
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,280
Hattori, Kazuha!

312
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,480
I didn't expect you guys to be here.

313
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,980
I heard the kid got hurt,

314
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,080
so we hopped on a plane after school.

315
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,080
So, how are you?

316
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,180
He's fine! He's healing very well,

317
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,580
they said he'll be able to leave in two or three days.

318
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,180
I'm glad to hear that.

319
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,380
Never mind that.

320
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,980
Why don't you go and buy different type of flower?

321
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,680
What? You sure have some nerve!

322
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,080
Will you girls go with Kazuha so that she doesn't get lost?

323
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,880
Of course.

324
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,680
So, what's the real reason you came here?

325
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,880
You hurt my feelings.

326
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,180
I came all this way just to see how you're doing.

327
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,380
I was shot in the stomach, too. We've got things in common.

328
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,180
I'm asking you again.

329
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,880
What is so important that you had to come all the way here

330
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,380
and brought flowers?

331
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,680
I guess I can't fool you, right?

332
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,380
Truth is,

333
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,280
I got a call from an old guy named Agasa last night.

334
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,280
He wanted to talk to me about you.

335
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,180
About me?

336
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,480
I don't know what's going on but...

337
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,680
Kudo.

338
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,280
You...

339
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,380
It seems that girl are starting to get suspicious

340
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,680
about who you really are.

341
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,180
No, she's not suspicious.

342
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,280
She already knows.

343
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,880
What? You told her?

344
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,780
Do you think I'm crazy?

345
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,280
Then, you and that old man

346
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,280
could be wrong about the whole thing.

347
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,980
You're so scared she'll find out,

348
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,780
your imagination got the best of you.

349
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:46,380
No, there's been a lot of signs she knows.

350
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,780
And unless I can come up with another me,

351
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,080
I don't think I can fool her.

352
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,080
But I don't understand,

353
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,980
if she knows,

354
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,680
why doesn't she just tell me?

355
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,180
You haven't changed, you can read other people's minds.

356
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,280
But you don't have the slightest idea

357
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,080
what's going on with yourself.

358
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,480
If that girl knows, but isn't saying anything,

359
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,980
then there's only one reason.

360
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,080
She's waiting!

361
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,580
She wants to hear it from you personally.

362
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,980
I guess you have to prepare for the worse and tell her everything,

363
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,080
about the so called group of men in black

364
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,480
and about the potion that made you shrink,

365
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,080
don't you think so?

366
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,480
You've got to be kidding.

367
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,880
Do you expect me to tell her all that? She's a kind person.

368
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,380
She listens to everyone's problems,

369
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,680
worries for them, and cries for them.

370
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,980
How can I do that to her?

371
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,380
But then again,

372
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,480
I don't think I can keep lying to her,

373
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,780
not after seeing how strained she was.

374
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:56,580
I really want to tell her everything and get it off my chest.

375
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,880
Hattori, listen.

376
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,780
What would you do?

377
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,080
What do you think is right?

378
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,380
Hey, Heiji.

379
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,480
Heiji.

380
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,680
On the last day of the school fest,

381
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,980
the play Ran's in.

382
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,680
It's on a Sunday, so you'll come with me, won't you?

383
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,180
Unless I can come up with another me,

384
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,880
I don't think I can fool her.

385
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,080
I'm sorry, but I can't go.

386
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,580
But why not?

387
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,080
I have something to do that day and I can't get out of it.

388
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,180
It's important.

389
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,380
"Potassium Cyanide"

390
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,180
"Conan Edogawa"

391
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,980
Listen, Shinichi.

392
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,080
You must never tell anyone about this!

393
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,180
And that includes Ran!

394
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,380
If that girl knows, but isn't saying anything,

395
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:54,480
then there's only one reason why.

396
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,980
You understand, don't you?

397
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,580
We can't let anyone know about us.

398
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,180
She's waiting!

399
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,980
She wants to hear it from you personally.

400
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,380
Don't leave me!

401
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,480
I guess I've got to tell her.

402
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,280
Haibara?

403
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,280
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,200
"Iced-coffee"

405
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,820
Next time, it's been a long time, but that person will show up in front of that person!

406
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:42,400
Cheers! It's me! Long time no see.
