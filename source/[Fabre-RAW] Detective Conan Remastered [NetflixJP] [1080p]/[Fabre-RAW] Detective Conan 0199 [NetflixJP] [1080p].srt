1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,440
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,640
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,140
Kogoro's always messing things up

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,940
but this time he's in a mess, big time!

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,640
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:03,190
"Kogoro Mouri The Suspect (Part 1)"

9
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,990
Peaches and melons and kumquats.

10
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,890
I just love summer fruits.

11
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,390
And they're so ripe.

12
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,090
Ran?

13
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,890
Why you...

14
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,990
You suggested we spend a night at a hotel since we were coming to Karuizawa

15
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,190
to get away from the heat in the city.

16
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,090
How come you're the only one who brought swimming trunks!

17
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,290
The whole idea was so he could look at girls in the pool, I bet.

18
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,590
Hey come back, I'm not through listening...

19
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,090
Too bad!

20
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,190
I'm not lending this to any dirty old man.

21
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,190
Besides, mom bought this for me.

22
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,190
Hey, wait. Wait up.

23
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,590
"Pool Entrance" -You can't blame me.

24
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,590
I've been so busy working lately,

25
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,090
the stress has been building up.

26
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,090
But I've been letting you sleep, haven't I?

27
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,390
Don't you think you're being unfair to mom?

28
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,990
You can't tell what she's doing about now either.

29
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:29,790
She could be going after some young guy...

30
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,690
Mom!

31
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,690
I don't believe it. What are you doing here?

32
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,290
I just told you.

33
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,690
I came to Karuizawa with a lawyer colleague

34
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,890
to do some sightseeing, that's all.

35
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,990
Then what about that neck tie you were buying just now?

36
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,290
That... a friend asked me to buy one

37
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,090
and I asked him to help me choose one,

38
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,590
isn't that right?

39
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,090
"Norifumi Saku (35)" -Really? I didn't know that.

40
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,190
"Lawyer" -I thought you were buying it for me.

41
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,890
This is no joking matter, Saku.

42
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,790
You're not a little kid,

43
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,290
can't you choose one on your own?

44
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,190
Well, excuse me.

45
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,090
Very interesting.

46
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,290
Ritsuko.

47
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,190
"Ritsuko Usui (32)" -The great Queen herself

48
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,890
"Lawyer" -is reduced to a mere commoner when it comes to her husband.

49
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,590
Did she say Queen?

50
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,190
Didn't you know?

51
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:47,290
She reigns so mightily in court, no one dares approach.

52
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,790
She's such an eloquent speaker,

53
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,590
even judges are left in awe

54
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,790
that's why she's been nicknamed Queen of the legal circle.

55
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,590
Will you stop saying that?

56
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,390
You're the only ones who call me that.

57
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:02,090
"Kenzo Shiozawa (41), Lawyer" -No, I heard some prosecutors say

58
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,790
that when they're in court up against Ms. Kisaki,

59
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,290
they feel like traitors defying their Queen.

60
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,690
I think I understand how that feels.

61
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,190
But now the number one female lawyer is you,

62
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,090
after you got a ruling in the second trial reversed

63
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,190
and took that famous case all the way to the High Court.

64
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,590
Anyone could have won that case.

65
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,290
Let me apologize then...

66
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,690
"Yuji Mikasa (37)" -I was the lawyer in first trial

67
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,590
"Lawyer" -and I guess I wasn't good enough

68
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,890
that's why I lost the case that anyone could have won.

69
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,590
No. That's not what I meant.

70
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,290
What I really meant was that winning a case like that

71
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,990
doesn't put me even close to Queen Eri's class.

72
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,390
Enough already.

73
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,190
You two may be separated but I still envy you,

74
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,390
a female lawyer who never loses

75
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,390
and a private detective who always solves his cases, what a couple.

76
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,490
Oh no...

77
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,890
I'm just an worthless man who is ever so proud

78
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,990
to be married to a grand lady.

79
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,190
You're right.

80
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,990
Then that must mean I'm a stupid woman

81
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,390
who's picked a woman chasing private detective, a low-life

82
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,390
who looks for the dirt in other people's lives as the man

83
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,990
to share her life with.

84
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,090
Good grief, how can you say that every time.

85
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,290
Mr. Mouri solves a case,

86
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,990
you cut out the article in the newspaper and put it in your scrapbook.

87
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,490
No, I don't.

88
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,490
Dad does that too.

89
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,290
Late at night, he sneaks

90
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,290
and reads all articles on the cases mom is working on.

91
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,090
Right, dad?

92
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,790
Don't tell her, you idiot.

93
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,690
Come on now, here we are, all in Karuizawa.

94
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,990
Let's just call a truce for tonight and have a good time.

95
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:49,190
Well, if Eri doesn't object, I'll oblige.

96
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:53,490
I don't mind... not one bit.

97
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,090
What is this? What's going on?

98
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,690
Could it be? They're still in love?

99
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,290
No way.

100
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:12,390
I'd like to hear Ritsuko's sweet voice pleading my case in court too.

101
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,190
Mr. Mouri.

102
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,890
I'm kidding.

103
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,490
Dad!

104
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,490
Ritsuko, your little hands are so cute.

105
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,790
You're my type.

106
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,390
From this to that.

107
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,290
Mom, wait!

108
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,990
What a drunkard.

109
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,090
Wait a minute.

110
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,890
Mom, you know that dad always gets like that when he's drunk.

111
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:50,390
Besides, you were with a man today yourself.

112
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,490
You looked so happy, choosing that tie.

113
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,390
You're right.

114
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,690
I shouldn't have bought this thing.

115
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,290
I let my guard down for one moment

116
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,890
and now I'm so mad, I think I might explode.

117
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:07,090
I don't believe it, you mean that tie's...

118
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,890
Yes, that's right.

119
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,990
Tomorrow's our wedding anniversary.

120
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,690
I felt sorry for you

121
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,990
and I thought maybe it was time for me to forgive him

122
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,590
so I figured I'd give him a present

123
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,790
but I'm glad I didn't.

124
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,690
Then I'll take that!

125
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:25,690
Hey, wait...

126
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,690
I'll give it to him for you!

127
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,790
No, come right back here!

128
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,390
I think I'll give it to him myself.

129
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,890
Good grief.

130
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,890
Did everybody leave?

131
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,290
Dad too?

132
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,290
He said he was going back to the room to sleep because he felt drunk...

133
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,790
Mom.

134
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,890
I think dad's in his room. Good luck.

135
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,790
All right.

136
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,990
Yes.

137
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,890
Ms. Kisaki.

138
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,690
I know it's late and I apologize

139
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,790
but is my husband here?

140
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,690
No, he's not, why?

141
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,390
I see.

142
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,290
Is something wrong?

143
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,190
I can't find dad,

144
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,590
he's not in our room or in the other 3 people's rooms.

145
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:37,690
Maybe he's wandering around outside,

146
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,790
he likes to feel the night air.

147
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,190
I'm sorry we disturbed you,

148
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,890
we'll go look outside.

149
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,290
Excuse us.

150
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,090
Let's go find him.

151
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,390
Yes, let's go.

152
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,190
Forgive me, Ms. Kisaki,

153
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,290
but I've finally discovered

154
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,290
that I'll never be like you, no matter how hard I try.

155
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,390
The only way I can ever rise above you...

156
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,190
is you've got to fall a few notches.

157
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,490
If you thought there was something

158
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,790
between your beloved husband here and me,

159
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,590
your ability to think clearly would be affected

160
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,290
and your work would suffer,

161
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,190
then you'd be forced to relinquish your title as number one to me.

162
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,090
Ritsuko Usui.

163
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,490
Good grief, are they back again?

164
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,290
How persistent.

165
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,390
What can I do for you?

166
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,990
Mr. Mouri's still not back?

167
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,790
Are you sure about that?

168
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,190
Yes.

169
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,390
We've looked everywhere, the hotel grounds,

170
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,690
the roof, the stairways, everywhere.

171
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,590
It's already 2 am.

172
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,490
That's strange.

173
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,990
He left with Miss Usui

174
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,290
because he said they were staying on the same floor.

175
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,990
I see.

176
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,090
So that leaves...

177
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,990
Ritsuko's room is the only one we haven't checked.

178
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,690
This wasn't here when we came here earlier.

179
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,890
Earlier?

180
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,590
We came here earlier to ask

181
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,290
but she said he wasn't with her.

182
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,890
Of course he wouldn't be.

183
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:40,490
I doubt those two would.

184
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,790
Mom, what are you doing?

185
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,190
Be quiet.

186
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,090
I don't believe it.

187
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:56,490
There's no mistake. That's his cellular phone.

188
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,090
It can't be.

189
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,190
Mikasa, I hate to ask but could you go to the front desk

190
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,790
and borrow their master key?

191
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,790
You bet.

192
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,490
-Please. -Thank you.

193
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,690
Look, the door chain's on.

194
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,190
What's the matter?

195
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,190
Hey, that's...

196
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,590
Isn't that Ritsuko?

197
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,290
Bell boy. Get the chain cutter, quick.

198
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,690
Stand back.

199
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,290
There's no time to waste.

200
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,690
Ritsuko.

201
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,790
Ritsuko.

202
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,990
Come on. What's wrong? Wake up.

203
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:49,990
Stop.

204
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,190
I don't feel a pulse.

205
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,690
That's impossible.

206
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,390
What happened?

207
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,590
Boy, what's all the racket about?

208
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,790
What's going on here?

209
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:09,190
-Dad? -Kogoro.

210
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,880
Why are you here?

211
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,980
The chain was on the door.

212
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,480
Ritsuko's body was on the floor

213
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,980
and only one other person was in this locked room.

214
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,780
-Hey, now... What's going on here? -Don't step on that.

215
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,680
That telephone cord on the floor is probably the weapon.

216
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,580
-Murder weapon? -Look, over there.

217
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,280
See the thin marking around her neck?

218
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,380
I see.

219
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:01,380
You're saying she was strangled with the telephone cord.

220
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,580
Hey. Why's Miss Usui lying on the...

221
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,380
Did you say strangled?

222
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,180
By who?

223
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,880
You're the one who could've done it.

224
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,780
Why'd you kill her?

225
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,380
Now just hold on.

226
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,380
I'm sure this is some kind of mistake.

227
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,880
My father would never kill anyone,

228
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,280
would he, mom?

229
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,080
Penal code 499...

230
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,380
A person charged with murder will be sentenced

231
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,880
to life or a minimum sentence of three years or...

232
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,180
the death penalty.

233
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,280
What?

234
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,080
Mom?

235
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,680
Ran. Why are you standing around?

236
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,880
Call the police at once.

237
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,880
She's got to be kidding.

238
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,280
Let me get this straight.

239
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,980
Your husband was missing,

240
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,780
you thought he might be in this room

241
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,580
so you called him on his cellular

242
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,680
and as you suspected,

243
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,780
you heard his cellular ringing in this room.

244
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,880
When you used the master key to unlock the door,

245
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,380
you found the chain was on

246
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,980
and you could see the victim lying on the floor

247
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,880
in the space between the door.

248
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,580
"Misao Yamamura" -When you broke down the door and entered the room,

249
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,580
"Gunma Prefecture Police Officer" -you found the victim was already dead,

250
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:24,180
and your husband was asleep on this bed, right?

251
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,880
Yes.

252
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,380
Then I'm sorry to tell you this

253
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,980
but your husband is the murderer.

254
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,380
That's not fair!

255
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,880
Just wait a minute. Dad, don't just stand there, say something.

256
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,780
Hey? I know you.

257
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,680
Aren't you Kogoro Mouri?

258
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,080
-Yes. -I'm in luck.

259
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,680
With a famous private detective like you on the scene,

260
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,880
this case's good as solved.

261
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,080
Why don't you tell me your thoughts regarding this murder?

262
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,780
Yes, dear.

263
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:58,180
Why don't you tell him all about what happened here

264
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,180
while you were snoring up a storm, Mr. Famous Private Detective?

265
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,580
He's your husband? You're married to Kogoro Mouri?

266
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,880
But, then, that means...

267
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,580
Then you're the murderer?

268
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,880
I don't believe it, what's going to happen

269
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,880
with "The Sleeping Kogoro's Mystery Solving Show"?

270
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,280
What do I care!

271
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,780
Officer Yamamura.

272
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:25,680
Shall we take Mr. Mouri down to the station for questioning?

273
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,980
I suppose if Mr. Mouri doesn't mind.

274
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,780
Dad.

275
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,880
I really wanted to see him solve the case in his sleep.

276
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,580
I guess you'll be his pre-indictment lawyer then?

277
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,880
Pre-indictment lawyer?

278
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,180
It's a system where a lawyer can be present with the suspect

279
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,380
so he gets treated fairly by the police.

280
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,780
Sorry, but I pass.

281
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:55,080
I'm not taking a case when I know the suspect's guilty.

282
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,780
I'm not going to spoil my perfect record.

283
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,580
I wasn't going to ask you anyway.

284
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,280
And don't you show up at the police station either, or you'll be sorry.

285
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,880
Dad!

286
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,680
Mom!

287
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,780
All right then, I'll take care of it,

288
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,780
besides, I don't think Mr. Mouri did it.

289
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,380
Let's go then.

290
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,280
Thank you very much.

291
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,980
How could you...

292
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,980
Mikasa, will you and Shiozawa leave the room?

293
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,380
I have something to say to the police officer.

294
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,780
Sure, no problem.

295
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,280
What are you going to say?

296
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,280
-Excuse me. -Yes?

297
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,780
Would you mind lending me your gloves?

298
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,480
Did you say gloves?

299
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,680
Mom, what are you going to do?

300
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,780
There are three things that don't add up.

301
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,980
The first is the telephone cord used to strangle the victim.

302
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,480
If he killed while he was drunk and without pre-meditation,

303
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,980
he would have ripped the cord out of the jack

304
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,280
but the telephone is still neatly in place

305
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,080
and there's no indication the cord was forcibly removed from either end.

306
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,580
The second thing is his cellular phone.

307
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,780
I have a feeling it was deliberately left near the door

308
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,180
so we could hear it ringing from outside.

309
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,180
And the third thing is, his hands.

310
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,180
Only about 40 minutes had passed

311
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,080
since the time we last spoke to her then found her body.

312
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,080
If he had strangled her with the cord,

313
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,380
there should still have been marks on his hands

314
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,880
unless of course, he wore leather gloves or something of that sort.

315
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,580
But we found nothing like that here.

316
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,680
Yes, I see what you mean, it is strange.

317
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,080
Mom, are you saying the reason you didn't go with dad to the station

318
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,780
was you wanted to check things out here.

319
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,180
Of course, silly.

320
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,680
I've known him much longer than you.

321
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,680
Sure, I was angry at first but I know better than anyone

322
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,380
that he isn't capable of murder.

323
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,180
Then when dad said he didn't want you to show up at the station,

324
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,480
what he really meant was he wanted you to find the evidence

325
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,080
that would clear him.

326
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,980
I wouldn't know.

327
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,180
Maybe he said that because he really didn't want to see me.

328
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,580
What's this?

329
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,880
There's a memo pad on the desk

330
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,980
and a page has been ripped out.

331
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,680
Maybe it's this? Is this the page?

332
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,980
It's kind of wrinkled but it has some writing on it, see?

333
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,080
Yes, it is her writing.

334
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,280
Hayashi? And is that the number two?

335
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,180
It could pertain to Hayashi a lawyer

336
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,880
who she'll be teaming up with on her next case.

337
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,780
He's been wanting to contact her to discuss that certain case.

338
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,580
What case is that?

339
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:59,480
It's the case everyone's talking about, regarding a company polluting the water.

340
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,280
They approached us at first

341
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,180
but neither Shiozawa nor I wanted to handle it

342
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,480
and Saku's a criminal lawyer,

343
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,480
so Ritsuko and Mikasa ended up with it.

344
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,680
They lost the first trial but were able to win the second.

345
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,680
She asked me to introduce another lawyer to replace Mikasa

346
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,680
because she wanted to win the case

347
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,280
and I thought of Mr. Hayashi.

348
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,680
But I hadn't told her about him yet.

349
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,380
It's strange though.

350
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,380
I don't think I told him the name of this hotel.

351
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,380
He said Mr. Shiozawa told him.

352
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,480
I'm sorry,

353
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,480
I'm the one who connected the call from Mr. Hayashi to this room.

354
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,980
Who told you could come in here?

355
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,380
I... something was bothering me

356
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,180
so I thought I'd better tell you about it.

357
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,780
So what's bothering you?

358
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,880
Actually, Mr. Hayashi called twice.

359
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,080
The first time he called, he got through,

360
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,880
but the second call came back to the desk,

361
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,280
I thought it was strange so I came up to the room to check.

362
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,180
I checked twice.

363
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,780
-You checked twice? -Yes.

364
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,680
The first time, I rang the doorbell and there was no answer

365
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,180
so I told Mr. Hayashi she might be resting,

366
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:19,580
but Mr. Hayashi said she might just be taking a bath

367
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,780
so he asked me to check again

368
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:29,280
and there was a do not disturb sign on the door and a note.

369
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,280
A note?

370
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,680
Yes, it said.

371
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:37,180
"I'm very sorry, please tell him I'll repay the money."

372
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,980
The writing was very distorted.

373
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,480
And did you give Mr. Hayashi the message?

374
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,280
Did you?

375
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,780
Yes, but he sounded very confused,

376
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,280
he said he was calling just to change the time of their meeting

377
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,880
the next day from 2 to 4.

378
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,180
I don't understand.

379
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,080
The note we found in the waste basket

380
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,280
was probably the memo regarding her meeting at 2 am with him.

381
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,480
That's right.

382
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,980
But the note on the door was about something totally different.

383
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:14,380
If she was killed before the second call,

384
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:20,980
then that means the killer put the sign and the note on the door.

385
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,280
But why would the killer do something so stupid?

386
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,880
It would only be leading us to conclude Kogoro didn't commit the crime.

387
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,300
Next Conan's Hint:

388
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,280
"Hayashi Rice"

389
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,480
Next episode, Pops will be even more cornered.

390
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,700
Mom, help him.

391
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,220
He can do whatever he wants.
