1
00:00:02,756 --> 00:00:05,856
Pops Kogoro, Ran and I

2
00:00:05,856 --> 00:00:09,256
went to visit a Noh museum located in the suburbs.

3
00:00:09,256 --> 00:00:13,256
The Mouri Detective Agency receives a letter warning

4
00:00:13,256 --> 00:00:18,156
that a scheme to kill the owner of the museum is underway.

5
00:00:18,156 --> 00:00:19,956
At the museum that was closed that day,

6
00:00:19,956 --> 00:00:22,956
besides the owner of the museum, Mr. Jisaburo Izumi,

7
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:26,356
his private nurse, Ms. Hatsuho Toba,

8
00:00:26,356 --> 00:00:29,756
all employees at the museum, Mr. Tatsuro Seikanji,

9
00:00:29,756 --> 00:00:33,856
Ms. Moyono Mibu, and Mr. Seinosuke Nagata,

10
00:00:33,856 --> 00:00:38,356
and Mr. Naruya Akaza, who came to visit the owner.

11
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,956
While the owner was showing us through the building,

12
00:00:42,956 --> 00:00:44,456
we encountered several dangerous situations

13
00:00:44,456 --> 00:00:46,156
that could've taken our lives,

14
00:00:46,156 --> 00:00:50,956
and eventually, Mr. Akaza ended up being killed.

15
00:00:50,956 --> 00:00:55,056
Ran and I who suspected Moyono, snuck into the office

16
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:57,556
in order to contact the police. However...

17
00:00:58,956 --> 00:01:01,656
I've got to call the police right away.

18
00:01:01,656 --> 00:01:05,356
Huh? I'm sure that Ms. Mibu made the call already.

19
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:08,256
She was just acting it out.

20
00:01:11,356 --> 00:01:12,956
Ran, run away!

21
00:01:15,856 --> 00:01:18,256
Don't you move either, Miss.

22
00:01:23,556 --> 00:01:24,756
I'll bet it never dawned on you that

23
00:01:24,756 --> 00:01:26,356
all three of us were accomplices.

24
00:01:26,356 --> 00:01:29,856
You stay put right there until we finish off the director.

25
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,356
So, you mean that person called Nagata is also one of them?

26
00:01:32,356 --> 00:01:33,556
Darn!

27
00:01:35,256 --> 00:01:37,256
Director Izumi's life is in danger!

28
00:01:40,556 --> 00:01:42,156
Aim for a 100% solution.

29
00:01:42,156 --> 00:01:44,556
Clear all mysteries and codes.

30
00:01:44,556 --> 00:01:46,356
There are three eerie accomplices!

31
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,456
Solve the mystery of the premeditated homicide!

32
00:01:48,456 --> 00:01:50,056
He sees through the one and only truth.

33
00:01:50,056 --> 00:01:51,956
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

34
00:01:51,956 --> 00:01:54,756
His name is Detective Conan!

35
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:41,033
"The Ogre Dances in the Noh Mask Mansion (Part 2)"

36
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:52,633
And so I fell asleep at a time like that.

37
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:04,733
What's this?

38
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:06,433
Hey, Miss.

39
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:09,433
It can't be.

40
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:17,033
Did they get away?

41
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:21,333
Those brats!

42
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,133
Awesome.

43
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:31,233
Mr. Mouri. To tell the truth.

44
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:35,633
This woman is the daughter of Kodo, the mask maker.

45
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:37,733
Although her surname has changed to Mibu

46
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:39,733
after her mother's divorce.

47
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:40,833
Director!

48
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:44,233
No problem, is there? He'll eventually find out anyway.

49
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:46,233
When Kodo was healthy,

50
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:48,533
he used to carve Noh masks over there.

51
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:52,233
That area was where you used to play, wasn't it?

52
00:04:58,433 --> 00:05:01,833
She was angry at Akaza for selling

53
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:05,433
her father's works for a cheap price.

54
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:09,833
Which means she had a motive for killing him.

55
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:13,933
Don't take him seriously, Mr. famed detective.

56
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:18,933
If you will excuse me, I'll go get you another cup of tea.

57
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:21,333
Oh, thank you.

58
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:27,333
Inspector sure is late, isn't he?

59
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:32,033
I'll go and check the entrance, then.

60
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:40,233
She's very diligent.

61
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:42,333
She helps me out a lot.

62
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,933
Not enough heavy weight.

63
00:05:54,433 --> 00:05:56,233
So, it's you.

64
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:59,933
We almost did it but... too bad.

65
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:27,433
What's this? This is the mask of Ayakashi?

66
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:34,733
Mr. Nagata.

67
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:35,933
Why?

68
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:37,233
Fire!

69
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,333
Let's go inside using that small entrance over there!

70
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:46,133
Darn! It won't open!

71
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:47,933
A saru seems to be inserted.

72
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:48,933
Saru?

73
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:51,233
It's a small lock used to lock rain shutters.

74
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,533
Those brats!

75
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:06,033
Director!

76
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:07,033
Don't worry.

77
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:09,333
Dad! Open this door!

78
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:12,633
Dad!

79
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,033
Coming!

80
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,233
Take the director outside!

81
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:16,233
Yes, sir.

82
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:18,133
I'll open it now!

83
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,033
Okay.

84
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:23,133
Where's the director?

85
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,333
Ms. Toba took him outside just now.

86
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,733
Where's Moyono?

87
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:30,933
She left saying that she'd serve us a new cup of tea a while ago.

88
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:34,933
Fire?

89
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:37,033
Darn! My God!

90
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:38,633
Let's get out of here too!

91
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,433
What? It won't open!

92
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:43,233
Let's go out to the yard from the small entrance.

93
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,233
The exit's?

94
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,233
Over there! There's a door!

95
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:58,733
Oh, what good timing! Help me, will you?

96
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:00,033
It'll take at least 20 minutes

97
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:01,933
before the firefighters get here.

98
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:20,833
Saved.

99
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,133
This is...

100
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:24,133
The place where the Noh stage is.

101
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:27,333
There's an exit!

102
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:34,633
The fire's already gotten around!

103
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:37,133
Dad, look over there!

104
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:40,233
The mask of Kijo?

105
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:42,833
It's that woman. Hey, come down here!

106
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:46,333
Don't you flee!

107
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,033
More than that, how're we going to get out of here?

108
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:51,333
It's a ladder! If we climb up there,

109
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,433
we can probably go outside through the skylight, no?

110
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:57,033
The skylight.

111
00:08:57,033 --> 00:08:59,133
Keep your eyes closed and you'll be fine!

112
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,433
Dad. Hang in there.

113
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:12,033
This looks bad, Ran.

114
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:14,133
We're quite a distance apart from the next building.

115
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:15,333
What now?

116
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,033
We'll use the ladder as a bridge now!

117
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:19,633
Bridge?

118
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:25,333
Quick, Dad.

119
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,933
Stop slave driving me.

120
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:32,233
Ready, get set!

121
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,433
We did!

122
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:39,533
If we cross the ladder, we can go over to the window.

123
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:48,633
I'll close my eyes.

124
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:51,433
Keep my eyes closed.

125
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:54,433
Just a bit more, Dad!

126
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:56,233
Keep...

127
00:09:57,033 --> 00:10:00,033
It's suddenly turned modern.

128
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:02,633
They probably added on this annex later.

129
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:05,433
Let's get going. That woman was there.

130
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:07,433
They're should be a way out.

131
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,633
An extension phone? Where's it coming from?

132
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:14,833
Hello.

133
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,233
Oh, Ms. Toba, so you're okay.

134
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:20,533
Yes, I'm in the kitchen with the director.

135
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:23,033
The fire hasn't gotten around here yet.

136
00:10:23,033 --> 00:10:24,333
Be careful!

137
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,133
Beware of the chief manager and the woman called Mibu.

138
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:28,933
Stay in hiding for a while.

139
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:31,233
We've already contacted the police.

140
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:32,933
Just hold it out a bit longer.

141
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,533
-No, don't, Sis. No! -What's the matter?

142
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:40,333
Sis?

143
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:45,333
Sis? You mean Hatsuho is Moyono's younger sister?

144
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,733
At any rate, we've got to hurry,

145
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,733
or the life of the director is in danger!

146
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:53,933
Somebody's lying on the ground.

147
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:55,233
No, it can't be.

148
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:02,033
It's the chief manager.

149
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:04,933
He's the third one.

150
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:06,633
Where are the director and Hatsuho?

151
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:08,633
In the kitchen. Let's go.

152
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:25,133
Darn. Too late.

153
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:35,033
Hatsuho?

154
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,533
Get a hold of yourself, Hatsuho.

155
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:52,533
I knew about my sister and her accomplices' plan and yet...

156
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:54,733
Yet in the end I had no choice but to kill her.

157
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:57,333
I stabbed my own sister,

158
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:00,633
so I'm a terrible sister.

159
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:02,933
You couldn't help it.

160
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:07,033
You could've been killed by her too, you know.

161
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:14,233
Director. And I warned you.

162
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:17,533
What's that?

163
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,933
An iron skewer and something is afloat.

164
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,633
What's this?

165
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:29,833
Inspector Megure.

166
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:34,733
These four people, Mr. Naruya Akaza. Mr. Tatsuro Seikanji.

167
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:36,733
Mr. Seinosuke Nagata and Ms. Moyono Mibu

168
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:38,933
have been confirmed dead, but...

169
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:42,133
Director Izumi has made it through.

170
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:43,633
Thank God.

171
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:47,033
We can't talk to him yet, though.

172
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:50,333
His stab wound matched the chisel

173
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,633
that Ms. Mibu was holding,

174
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:54,533
so there's probably no doubt that she's the one

175
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:56,233
who attacked him.

176
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,433
Okay.

177
00:12:58,133 --> 00:12:59,633
Chisel?

178
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:07,333
No, don't, Sis!

179
00:13:08,433 --> 00:13:09,833
I see.

180
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,833
I get it.

181
00:13:17,877 --> 00:13:20,077
I tried but couldn't stop her.

182
00:13:20,077 --> 00:13:23,677
My older sister had a grudge against the director.

183
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:24,877
Because he used Akaza

184
00:13:24,877 --> 00:13:28,677
to sell off our father's works abroad.

185
00:13:28,677 --> 00:13:32,177
How did you feel about the director?

186
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:36,377
My mother is not the same as my sister's

187
00:13:36,377 --> 00:13:38,477
and we were brought up apart from each other for a long time.

188
00:13:38,477 --> 00:13:41,977
Besides, the director treated me very well.

189
00:13:41,977 --> 00:13:44,677
That's why when you heard of the murder plan,

190
00:13:44,677 --> 00:13:46,077
you wanted to prevent it.

191
00:13:46,077 --> 00:13:50,577
Yes. That's why I sent Mr. Mouri the letter.

192
00:13:50,577 --> 00:13:52,877
But I couldn't stop my older sister from going on with the plan.

193
00:13:52,877 --> 00:13:57,177
Was she the one who killed the chief manager and manager too?

194
00:13:57,177 --> 00:13:58,777
I think it was her.

195
00:13:58,777 --> 00:14:00,877
Because she used to say if those two die,

196
00:14:00,877 --> 00:14:04,877
all the cash would be hers.

197
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,477
I see.

198
00:14:06,477 --> 00:14:07,777
Inspector.

199
00:14:08,577 --> 00:14:10,077
Although I did it on the spur of the moment,

200
00:14:10,077 --> 00:14:12,877
I'm the one who stabbed my sister.

201
00:14:12,877 --> 00:14:16,577
You took the iron skewer out from the kitchen, didn't you?

202
00:14:16,577 --> 00:14:19,777
I was trying to protect the director, you see.

203
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:20,877
Please...

204
00:14:22,077 --> 00:14:26,377
It's true that you stabbed Ms. Mibu,

205
00:14:26,377 --> 00:14:28,877
but in your case,

206
00:14:28,877 --> 00:14:31,777
I guess it'll be concluded as killing in self defense.

207
00:14:31,777 --> 00:14:35,477
I'll hear the rest of you out at the station.

208
00:14:35,477 --> 00:14:36,677
Yes, sir.

209
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:39,177
Mr. Mouri. Come along with us too.

210
00:14:39,177 --> 00:14:40,177
Yes, sir.

211
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:45,977
Hey. The case has already been...

212
00:14:47,677 --> 00:14:49,777
Solved.

213
00:14:49,777 --> 00:14:52,177
Far from it, Inspector.

214
00:14:52,177 --> 00:14:56,477
The culprit is right in front of your eyes.

215
00:14:57,577 --> 00:15:00,077
Just what're you talking about, Mr. Mouri?

216
00:15:00,077 --> 00:15:03,577
Dad, Hatsuho is a victim, isn't she?

217
00:15:04,777 --> 00:15:07,377
First of all, I couldn't understand

218
00:15:07,377 --> 00:15:10,177
how Mr. Akaza was killed.

219
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:13,677
How did the culprit lace the poison onto what the victim took?

220
00:15:13,677 --> 00:15:15,477
Hatsuho licked the cheese

221
00:15:15,477 --> 00:15:18,677
and Mr. Akaza who ate that same cheese

222
00:15:18,677 --> 00:15:20,177
dies right after that.

223
00:15:20,177 --> 00:15:26,177
So, was poison laced onto the butter knife that Mr. Akaza used?

224
00:15:26,177 --> 00:15:29,377
But, everyone was free to sit wherever he wanted to back then

225
00:15:29,377 --> 00:15:31,277
so, it would've been impossible to place an aim on,

226
00:15:31,277 --> 00:15:33,477
and kill the target.

227
00:15:33,477 --> 00:15:36,877
However, there is just one way that it could've been done.

228
00:15:36,877 --> 00:15:39,677
By using the spoon that first used by the taster.

229
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:44,277
If the poison was laced only onto the back of the spoon.

230
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,377
Even if the cheese that was scooped was not poisoned,

231
00:15:46,377 --> 00:15:47,577
at this instant,

232
00:15:47,577 --> 00:15:51,177
the poison was laced onto the remaining cheese.

233
00:15:51,177 --> 00:15:56,077
When Mr. Akaza died, the spoon that fell to the floor

234
00:15:56,077 --> 00:15:59,377
was switched to a clean spoon before we knew it.

235
00:16:00,777 --> 00:16:02,977
Because if the spoon were to be left as is,

236
00:16:02,977 --> 00:16:06,177
the trick would be exposed.

237
00:16:06,177 --> 00:16:07,877
The only one who was capable of

238
00:16:07,877 --> 00:16:12,577
doing something like that back then was you, Hatsuho

239
00:16:12,577 --> 00:16:16,577
who wiped off the cheese from the director.

240
00:16:16,577 --> 00:16:19,677
The real reason you sent me the forewarning of murder

241
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:22,677
was to set me up as a witness.

242
00:16:22,677 --> 00:16:26,077
To make me testify that the three villains died

243
00:16:26,077 --> 00:16:31,177
and you survived through legitimate self-defence.

244
00:16:31,177 --> 00:16:32,877
After keeping me in check by the fire,

245
00:16:32,877 --> 00:16:35,477
you went out and killed everyone during that time.

246
00:16:35,477 --> 00:16:38,177
But, you couldn't afford having me burn to death.

247
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:39,877
You probably stuck your face out of that window

248
00:16:39,877 --> 00:16:41,477
because of this.

249
00:16:41,477 --> 00:16:45,977
Then, the person wearing the mask of Kijo wasn't Moyono?

250
00:16:45,977 --> 00:16:48,677
No. And, the highlight of your act,

251
00:16:48,677 --> 00:16:52,377
was your scream on the extension phone.

252
00:16:52,377 --> 00:16:54,877
Back then, you had already stabbed the director

253
00:16:54,877 --> 00:16:56,777
and killed your older sister.

254
00:16:56,777 --> 00:16:59,877
But she screamed 'No, don't, Sis'.

255
00:16:59,877 --> 00:17:01,977
She acted it out alone.

256
00:17:01,977 --> 00:17:04,677
I couldn't have don't something like that.

257
00:17:04,677 --> 00:17:08,177
The director was stabbed with the chisel by my older sister.

258
00:17:08,177 --> 00:17:13,277
But, I didn't have time to take a weapon like that out with me!

259
00:17:13,277 --> 00:17:14,777
I see.

260
00:17:14,777 --> 00:17:17,577
It's true that Moyono could've done that.

261
00:17:18,177 --> 00:17:20,577
You probably seduced her to do so, either way,

262
00:17:20,577 --> 00:17:21,977
by telling her to use the tools

263
00:17:21,977 --> 00:17:24,677
that your father use to use to kill the director.

264
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:27,677
But, you took the iron skewers.

265
00:17:27,677 --> 00:17:31,477
It would never serve as a substitute for the chisel!

266
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:34,377
You stabbed your sister with the iron skewer.

267
00:17:34,377 --> 00:17:36,577
Moyono Mibu may have been a terrible woman,

268
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:39,377
but I guess she trusted her younger sister?

269
00:17:39,377 --> 00:17:41,377
No, I don't think that's it.

270
00:17:41,377 --> 00:17:43,477
I'm sure she assumed that the one who sent me the letter

271
00:17:43,477 --> 00:17:45,077
was her younger sister.

272
00:17:45,077 --> 00:17:47,977
That's why I'm sure she figured that she couldn't trust you.

273
00:17:47,977 --> 00:17:49,677
Then, you took the initiative

274
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:51,977
and stabbed the director before her eyes.

275
00:17:53,677 --> 00:17:55,977
Then, after Moyono started to trust you,

276
00:17:55,977 --> 00:17:59,077
you stabbed her from the front using the iron skewer.

277
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:01,677
But the director's wound

278
00:18:01,677 --> 00:18:04,277
was one that was made using a chisel, wasn't it?

279
00:18:04,277 --> 00:18:08,377
Right. That was your final stronghold,

280
00:18:08,377 --> 00:18:13,077
but unfortunately, you left behind a crucial evidence.

281
00:18:13,077 --> 00:18:15,577
The culprit was very busy.

282
00:18:15,577 --> 00:18:19,377
You were unlucky that you had no time to erase the evidence.

283
00:18:19,377 --> 00:18:21,577
Conan, bring it over here, will you?

284
00:18:21,577 --> 00:18:23,577
Okay.

285
00:18:23,577 --> 00:18:25,177
Here it is!

286
00:18:25,177 --> 00:18:27,277
What is it?

287
00:18:27,277 --> 00:18:29,577
It just looks like a plain piece of wood.

288
00:18:29,577 --> 00:18:34,177
According to Pops, he thinks it's handmade by that lady.

289
00:18:35,177 --> 00:18:37,577
There's a V-shaped slit made on it.

290
00:18:37,577 --> 00:18:41,377
It looks sort of like the teeth of a chisel.

291
00:18:41,377 --> 00:18:43,577
A chisel?

292
00:18:43,577 --> 00:18:44,877
I get it!

293
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:50,177
Yep! That lady brought two skewers out of the kitchen.

294
00:18:50,177 --> 00:18:51,977
She assembled the two skewers

295
00:18:51,977 --> 00:18:55,377
so that the flat sides would form a V-shape

296
00:18:55,377 --> 00:19:00,277
and inserted them into the slits of the two wooden pieces.

297
00:19:00,277 --> 00:19:04,377
She stabbed the director with her handmade weapon.

298
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,677
Isn't that right, Miss?

299
00:19:15,077 --> 00:19:17,677
You got me there! You really got me!

300
00:19:17,677 --> 00:19:19,577
I give up, sonny.

301
00:19:22,877 --> 00:19:27,777
Absolutely, that Hatsuho Toba's exclusive weapon making device.

302
00:19:27,777 --> 00:19:30,477
At first, I made it look like a chisel,

303
00:19:30,477 --> 00:19:33,877
the second time I used just one skewer.

304
00:19:33,877 --> 00:19:37,477
Which means you did it, after all.

305
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:41,077
Yes, I'm the culprit.

306
00:19:41,077 --> 00:19:45,577
Why'd you go as far as to kill your own sister?

307
00:19:45,577 --> 00:19:47,177
Why wouldn't I?

308
00:19:47,177 --> 00:19:50,677
That woman was the director's lover, you get?

309
00:19:50,677 --> 00:19:54,577
She lead a rich comfortable life with the director's money

310
00:19:54,577 --> 00:19:57,977
while my Mother and I were barely making a living.

311
00:19:57,977 --> 00:20:00,777
She dares holding a grudge against her father at this point?

312
00:20:00,777 --> 00:20:02,677
That's nonsense.

313
00:20:02,677 --> 00:20:05,577
That jerk Akaza was selling off valuable Noh masks

314
00:20:05,577 --> 00:20:07,877
as instructed by the director!

315
00:20:07,877 --> 00:20:09,577
On top of that, he had the nerve to copy that director

316
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:12,177
and give me the eye.

317
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,577
Talk about giving me the creeps.

318
00:20:13,577 --> 00:20:17,477
A museum so superficial should just burn down to ashes.

319
00:20:17,477 --> 00:20:19,377
It would do everyone and the world more good

320
00:20:19,377 --> 00:20:22,377
to turn this place into a park as soon as possible!

321
00:20:22,377 --> 00:20:25,977
Inspector! I'm sorry to have kept waiting!

322
00:20:25,977 --> 00:20:27,777
I'm done with my speech!

323
00:20:27,777 --> 00:20:31,477
Go on and arrest me or do what you have to do!

324
00:20:31,477 --> 00:20:32,977
Hey, Takagi!

325
00:20:32,977 --> 00:20:34,777
Yes, sir!

326
00:20:39,477 --> 00:20:40,677
Hello.

327
00:20:41,577 --> 00:20:44,677
Oh, yes. I got it.

328
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:47,477
It seems that Director Izumi regained consciousness.

329
00:20:47,477 --> 00:20:48,677
I see.

330
00:20:49,577 --> 00:20:51,477
Just as I thought.

331
00:20:51,477 --> 00:20:53,777
I thought it had a dull feel.

332
00:20:53,777 --> 00:20:57,177
When I stabbed him, the wheelchair moved into the fountain

333
00:20:57,177 --> 00:20:58,977
so I couldn't strike the final blow.

334
00:20:58,977 --> 00:21:02,777
I'm still haphazard.

335
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:04,477
Oh, that's right.

336
00:21:04,477 --> 00:21:08,977
The director seems to have said to tell the boy thank you.

337
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:11,477
What did he mean, Conan?

338
00:21:11,477 --> 00:21:13,877
I guess it was of some help to him then.

339
00:21:15,377 --> 00:21:16,977
Hey, Director,

340
00:21:16,977 --> 00:21:20,177
if you wrap a strong braided rope like this around yourself,

341
00:21:20,177 --> 00:21:21,977
if something comes up, I'm sure it'll at least

342
00:21:21,977 --> 00:21:23,677
be able to protect you a bit.

343
00:21:23,677 --> 00:21:25,877
I see.

344
00:21:25,877 --> 00:21:28,177
Okay, in fact the accessory of the armor

345
00:21:28,177 --> 00:21:29,377
would probably protect me

346
00:21:29,377 --> 00:21:31,477
even if I were to be attacked with a knife.

347
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:34,677
Thank God.

348
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:01,577
The ones who schemed the killing of the director,

349
00:23:01,577 --> 00:23:05,977
ended up getting killed and so this ended ironically.

350
00:23:08,977 --> 00:23:10,977
What's up, Pops?

351
00:23:10,977 --> 00:23:14,277
This case sort of had a bad taste to it, didn't it?

352
00:23:14,277 --> 00:23:17,477
To think that all those involved were bad people.

353
00:23:17,477 --> 00:23:19,877
But in any case, it's like this!

354
00:23:19,877 --> 00:23:21,877
Since it's a murder case,

355
00:23:21,877 --> 00:23:23,977
it's not something that you can just say sorry and forget about.

356
00:23:23,977 --> 00:23:27,277
But if you think you did something bad, you should apologise.

357
00:23:28,677 --> 00:23:30,477
To the Noh masks.

358
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,877
Even if there's Noh excuse!

359
00:23:34,877 --> 00:23:36,877
Get it?

360
00:23:39,277 --> 00:23:40,677
Too funny!

361
00:23:40,677 --> 00:23:44,777
I thought he was in deep thought and this is what comes out.

362
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,760
Next Conan's Hint:

363
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,620
"Chocolate Bar"
