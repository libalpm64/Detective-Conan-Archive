1
00:00:02,447 --> 00:00:06,847
That day, I got up after being haunted by a nightmare.

2
00:00:06,847 --> 00:00:07,987
Come to think of it,

3
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:11,991
it could've been a warning for the worse to come.

It's okay, isn't it?

6
00:00:18,247 --> 00:00:22,001
"Sayuri Tokomae (40)" -Mr. Mouri, pretty please.

7
00:00:22,847 --> 00:00:25,547
If you're worried that a robber's after you,

8
00:00:25,547 --> 00:00:29,547
why don't you take off all that expensive looking accessory and run?

9
00:00:29,547 --> 00:00:32,547
But, I want to show my accessories off.

10
00:00:32,547 --> 00:00:35,547
Please keep me company an hour every day

11
00:00:35,547 --> 00:00:38,017
when I go jogging to keep me from getting fat.

12

Mr. Mouri...

13
00:00:39,647 --> 00:00:43,647
She says Pops looks like her late husband.

14
00:00:43,647 --> 00:00:47,047
That's no job for a detective.

15
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:52,031
Dad really can't handle it, can he?

16
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:56,035
Please, please, pretty please, keep me company.

17
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,447
Yes, yes, yes.

18
00:00:58,447 --> 00:01:01,047
Yes, this is the Mouri Detective Agency.

I'm Ryozo Gamo.

20
00:01:03,547 --> 00:01:06,447
I want you to look for a witness who can prove my alibi.

21
00:01:06,447 --> 00:01:10,647
Yes, this is indeed the kind of job for a detective.

22
00:01:10,647 --> 00:01:13,347
Yes. Tomorrow at 7 pm,

23
00:01:13,347 --> 00:01:14,847
at Fugu Taisho.

24
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:17,847
Okay!

25
00:01:17,847 --> 00:01:20,747
Let's talk of the details then.

26
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,947
I'm sorry, Mrs. Tokomae.

27
00:01:22,947 --> 00:01:25,547
I have urgent business to attend to.

28
00:01:25,547 --> 00:01:28,347
I was here first.

29
00:01:29,347 --> 00:01:30,447
Frightening.

30
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:34,447
I don't think she needs a bodyguard.

31
00:01:34,447 --> 00:01:37,647
See, talk about bad things happening.

32
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:41,247
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

Saturday nights are for mystery.

34
00:01:43,647 --> 00:01:46,085
A mistaken deduction finally brings destruction.

35
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:48,087
Is it truly the end for Detective Mouri.

36
00:01:48,247 --> 00:01:49,847
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:01:49,847 --> 00:01:51,647
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38

No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

He's going to be late because of an emergency?

42
00:03:44,777 --> 00:03:48,677
Yes. Mr. Gamo called and told me to tell you

43
00:03:48,677 --> 00:03:49,977
that he's sorry he's going to be late,

44
00:03:49,977 --> 00:03:52,577
but to start without him.

Sir, he's here.

It's that man over there.

00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:10,229
Here you go.

50
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:11,777
Thank you always.

51
00:04:11,777 --> 00:04:13,277

"Sakae Isado (56) is found stabbed to death" -What is this?

57
00:04:22,777 --> 00:04:26,245
Of course I know about this case.

58
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:27,577
About half a month ago,

59
00:04:27,577 --> 00:04:31,777
the owner of an antique shop at Tsukimicho,

60
00:04:31,777 --> 00:04:34,253
Sakae Ikasa was killed.

61
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:38,257
The police suspect me as being the killer.

62
00:04:39,177 --> 00:04:40,677
I've got a motive too.

63
00:04:40,677 --> 00:04:44,263
Five years ago, he deceived me and took a lot of money from me.

64
00:04:44,477 --> 00:04:47,977
When an officer came to check my alibi,

65
00:04:47,977 --> 00:04:52,977
I inadvertently answered that I was home.

66
00:04:52,977 --> 00:04:54,977
But, the fact is...

67
00:04:54,977 --> 00:04:58,077
"Akebonocho Station" -I was walking around Akebonocho.

68
00:04:58,077 --> 00:05:01,277
But I was alone so I have nobody to prove it.

69
00:05:01,277 --> 00:05:02,877
I thought that they would suspect me

70
00:05:02,877 --> 00:05:06,285
if I told them that I was out so I lied.

71
00:05:07,777 --> 00:05:11,577
If the police find out that I lied,

72
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:13,577
the more they'll suspect me.

73
00:05:13,577 --> 00:05:15,377
So, Mr. Mouri...

74
00:05:15,377 --> 00:05:18,777
I would like you to find somebody who can testify

75
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:21,477
that I was at Akebonocho on the day of the crime.

76
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:25,077
You can count on me to find a witness to prove your alibi.

77
00:05:25,077 --> 00:05:26,677
I can do that hands down.

78
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:31,477
You're sure dependable just as you're reputed to be.

79
00:05:31,477 --> 00:05:35,277
Since I go out a lot and don't carry a cell phone,

80
00:05:35,277 --> 00:05:39,177
I'll call you to find out what you come up with.

81
00:05:39,177 --> 00:05:42,321
So, let's drink and eat!

82
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:49,877
Thank you.

83
00:05:49,877 --> 00:05:52,331
Mr. Gamo, I hope to be seeing you again soon.

84
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:55,977
Mr. Gamo, thanks for treating me the other day.

85
00:05:55,977 --> 00:05:58,337
Mr. Gamo, won't you drop by.

86
00:05:58,337 --> 00:06:01,977
You're sure popular, Mr. Gamo.

87
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:06,977
Would you like to go to another shop?

88
00:06:06,977 --> 00:06:09,077
Yes. Let's go, let's go.

89
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,349
Let's drink up.

90
00:06:14,977 --> 00:06:18,357
"Akebonocho Station" -I started working from the next morning.

91
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:22,677
But investigation turned out to be quite difficult then I first thought,

92
00:06:22,677 --> 00:06:26,365
and I got a call from Mr. Gamo every night pushing me for results.

93
00:06:30,777 --> 00:06:33,277
Give me a break.

94
00:06:33,277 --> 00:06:36,177
Then, on Friday night, the sixth day.

95
00:06:39,377 --> 00:06:40,677
Did you find it?

96
00:06:40,677 --> 00:06:41,977
Dad?

97
00:06:41,977 --> 00:06:45,377
Yoko Okino is appearing from 8 pm.

98
00:06:48,077 --> 00:06:50,177
It's like regular courier service.

99
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:51,377
Talk about bad timing.

100
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:53,577
-Yes. -This is Gamo.

101
00:06:53,577 --> 00:06:55,977
I was asking around all day today too, but...

102
00:06:55,977 --> 00:06:58,177
You got no results?

103
00:06:58,177 --> 00:07:01,577
You, the renown detective is my only hope and yet...

104
00:07:01,577 --> 00:07:03,177
I'm doomed.

105
00:07:04,677 --> 00:07:06,677
What do you mean you're doomed?

106
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:09,677
Talk about exaggerating.

107
00:07:20,977 --> 00:07:22,421
The estimated time of his death

108
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:24,877
is between 7 pm to 9 pm last night.

109
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,777
It seems that there are no traces of the corpse

110
00:07:27,777 --> 00:07:29,077
having been moved after death.

111
00:07:30,977 --> 00:07:32,077
Inspector Megure,

112
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,877
I've brought Mr. Mouri with me.

113
00:07:33,877 --> 00:07:35,577
Thank you for the trouble.

114
00:07:35,577 --> 00:07:39,277
What did you want with me, Inspector Megure?

115
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:42,077
Well, although it looks to be suicide,

116
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:46,777
at the feet of the corpse, this was found crumpled up.

117
00:07:46,777 --> 00:07:49,277
The phone number of my agency.

118
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:53,177
I'm going to take a peek at his face.

119
00:07:55,677 --> 00:07:56,777
Mr. Gamo?

120
00:08:01,577 --> 00:08:04,077
Then what he said about him being doomed

121
00:08:04,077 --> 00:08:07,477
to you on the phone yesterday was true?

122
00:08:07,477 --> 00:08:09,877
What do you mean by that?

123
00:08:12,077 --> 00:08:15,177
I brought him here to confirm the corpse.

124
00:08:15,177 --> 00:08:16,475
"Kyosuke Arai (42)" -He's Mr. Gamo's nephew,

125
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:18,477
Mr. Kyosuke Arai.

126
00:08:18,677 --> 00:08:22,277
What did he mean when he said he was doomed?

127
00:08:27,777 --> 00:08:29,377
I see.

128
00:08:29,377 --> 00:08:31,477
So, that's why.

129
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:35,077
Now, we've grasped Mr. Gamo's tracks of what he did last night.

130
00:08:35,077 --> 00:08:38,077
Mr. Gamo who was a suspect for having killed Mr. Sakae Kinugasa,

131
00:08:38,077 --> 00:08:40,077
owner of the antique shop

132
00:08:40,077 --> 00:08:42,501
called Mr. Mouri at 8 pm last night

133
00:08:42,677 --> 00:08:45,677
and was depressed to find that

134
00:08:45,677 --> 00:08:47,677
there had been no progress regarding his request,

135
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:50,077
drove over here with his car and committed suicide.

136
00:08:50,077 --> 00:08:54,077
It takes approximately an hour from the Gamo residence to here,

137
00:08:54,077 --> 00:08:56,515
so he committed suicide at 9 pm.

138
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:58,877
It also matches the estimated time of death.

139
00:08:58,877 --> 00:09:02,277
But inspector, if he was really innocent,

140
00:09:02,277 --> 00:09:04,523
I don't see any reason as to why he would have to get depressed

141
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:06,525
over not being able to find someone who witnessed his alibi.

142
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:07,677
"Police Detective Hisamoto (50)" -Mr. Gamo...

143
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:09,377
went through a bitter experience

144
00:09:09,377 --> 00:09:11,177
of being arrested despite being innocent.

145
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:12,531
Mistakenly arrested?

146
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:18,537
Five years ago,

147
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:21,077
the victim of this incident, Mr. Kinugasa was attacked in the dark,

148
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:24,543
and through eye-witness reports,

149
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:27,577
an officer of the Josai Police Department,

150
00:09:27,577 --> 00:09:29,877
in our jurisdiction arrested Mr. Gamo.

151
00:09:29,877 --> 00:09:31,477
However, several days later,

152
00:09:31,477 --> 00:09:33,877
it was found that Mr. Gamo had an alibi.

153
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:35,677
I remember.

154
00:09:35,677 --> 00:09:37,977
Uncle told me that he was taken away

155
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,559
by the police against his will and really scared.

156
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,563
He feared that he was going to have to go through what he did before,

157
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:46,177
therefore, felt doomed.

158
00:09:46,177 --> 00:09:49,777
We tried to be as careful as possible

159
00:09:49,777 --> 00:09:52,571
with the investigation so as not to repeat Takeoka's mistake.

160
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:54,077
Takeoka?

161
00:09:54,077 --> 00:09:56,077
You mean, Isao Takeoka?

162
00:09:56,077 --> 00:10:00,579
Yes, he felt responsible for his mistake back then and quit.

163
00:10:00,777 --> 00:10:02,977
Is it the Mr. Takeoka I know?

164
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,277
Do you know him?

165
00:10:04,277 --> 00:10:07,877
He used to come over sometimes to spend time with dad.

166
00:10:07,877 --> 00:10:10,377
You mean that Takeoka that entered police school

167
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:11,777
together with you.

168
00:10:15,177 --> 00:10:16,377
It's me.

169
00:10:17,677 --> 00:10:19,777
Okay, I'll head back right away.

170
00:10:19,777 --> 00:10:24,277
It seems they just arrested the murderer who killed Mr. Sakae Kinugasa.

171
00:10:24,277 --> 00:10:25,277
What?

172
00:10:25,277 --> 00:10:27,777
I'll report back on the details later.

173
00:10:30,077 --> 00:10:32,611
If the killer was arrested a bit earlier,

174
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:35,177
uncle didn't have to take such rash action.

175
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:39,077
This place sure is spooky at night

176
00:10:39,077 --> 00:10:41,677
because there aren't any lights anywhere.

177
00:10:41,677 --> 00:10:43,977
True.

178
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,977
This area is supposed to be pitch dark at night.

179
00:10:46,977 --> 00:10:50,629
Yes, that's why there was a flashlight

180
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:52,077
at the feet of Mr. Gamo's body.

181
00:10:52,077 --> 00:10:53,677
Why would he prepare something like that

182
00:10:53,677 --> 00:10:54,633
and bring it along with him,

183
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:56,977
coming all the way out to a place like this?

184
00:10:56,977 --> 00:10:59,377
He could've committed suicide at home.

185
00:10:59,377 --> 00:11:01,177
True.

186
00:11:01,177 --> 00:11:04,643
There was a reason that it had to be here

187
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:06,377
for the killer that is.

188
00:11:06,377 --> 00:11:08,277
The killer?

189
00:11:08,277 --> 00:11:10,977
Inspector, this is a homicide case.

190
00:11:11,977 --> 00:11:13,077
Homicide?

191
00:11:15,177 --> 00:11:18,677
In the last phone call I received from Mr. Gamo

192
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:21,077
saying that he was doomed,

193
00:11:21,077 --> 00:11:23,577
I'm sure that the killer decided to use those words to his advantage

194
00:11:23,577 --> 00:11:26,077
to make Mr. Gamo's death look like suicide.

195
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:33,077
It's no use doing something like this.

196
00:11:33,077 --> 00:11:36,377
But, we can't totally disregard the possibility of homicide.

197
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:38,677
But, if it's as Mr. Mouri deduced,

198
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:41,077
it would mean that the killer was here last night.

199
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:46,277
It seems that Mr. Gamo complained to a bread manufacturer.

200
00:11:46,277 --> 00:11:47,577
Complained?

201
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:50,477
We received a complaint call from him the other day

202
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,691
regarding our Smiley black bean bun.

203
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:57,377
Receiving a complaint about a black bean bun

204
00:11:57,377 --> 00:12:02,077
is no motive for murder, is it?

205
00:12:02,077 --> 00:12:03,977
Mr. Mouri, how long do you insist on

206
00:12:03,977 --> 00:12:06,077
saying that this is a case of homicide?

207
00:12:06,077 --> 00:12:08,177
Until I'm totally convinced it's not.

208
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:10,377
Uncle committed suicide!

209
00:12:11,977 --> 00:12:14,713
Of course, I don't mean to rush to conclusions but...

210
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:15,877
Inspector Megure.

211
00:12:19,877 --> 00:12:23,677
I hear that you've been having arguments with Mr. Gamo recently.

212
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:24,723
Oh, no.

213
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:26,725
It's just a little something over trivial matters.

214
00:12:26,977 --> 00:12:28,727
Something like you asked him to lend you money,

215
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:31,277
but refused you flatly?

216
00:12:39,877 --> 00:12:41,277
-Mr. Mouri! -Mr. Mouri!

217
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:43,177
It seems that you fantastically saw through a homicide

218
00:12:43,177 --> 00:12:45,277
that was set up to look like suicide.

219
00:12:45,277 --> 00:12:47,477
You already know who the killer is, don't you?

220
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:50,377
I solved the case a bit too fast, in spite of myself.

You were asked by him to search for a witness to his alibi

225
00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:02,377
but you couldn't,

226
00:13:02,377 --> 00:13:05,077
and your client who felt doomed committed suicide.

227
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:07,077
Where did you get that story from?

Who cares?

229
00:13:09,477 --> 00:13:11,977
Why does he know about it?

230
00:13:11,977 --> 00:13:14,377
The police would never tell him about it either.

231
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,077
Please tell me.

232
00:13:16,077 --> 00:13:17,577
How do you intend to take responsibility

233
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:20,577
for cornering your client to kill himself, Mr. Mouri?

234
00:13:20,577 --> 00:13:23,077
Mr. Gamo did not commit suicide!

235
00:13:23,077 --> 00:13:24,477
It's homicide!

236

and quit the police force.

Gamo didn't commit suicide.

271

The feeling that I got when I interrogated him five years ago, was...

272
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,609
he's not that type of guy.

after your client's been killed either.

276
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:29,609
It could be a grudge

277
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:31,709
or someone who was in conflict with him that killed him.

278
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:34,909
If it's somebody that hated him, I know one.

279
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:36,709
Who is it?

280
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:39,309
The guy right in front of you.

281
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:42,409
I know, I wasn't being sensible, but I did hate him.

282
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:44,009
I have a motive.

283
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,509
Where were you the night before yesterday?

284
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:48,709
What's the estimated time of death?

285
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:50,609
Just around 9 pm.

286
00:15:51,609 --> 00:15:52,931
Too bad.

287
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:55,509
I met an acquaintance at 8:30 pm

288
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:58,009
and stayed with him till midnight.

289
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:00,109
Immovable alibi.

290
00:16:01,109 --> 00:16:03,409
Okay. Let's go, Takeoka.

291
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:04,409
Yes.

292
00:16:06,109 --> 00:16:07,909
It's just like the old days.

293
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:13,609
Kogoro.

294
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:17,709
So, it seems that you finished the work that you were asked to do.

295
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:20,609
Nothing's finished at all.

296
00:16:20,609 --> 00:16:22,109
Things are just starting.

297
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:28,309
So, the guy Gamo disappearing doesn't work.

298
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:30,969
What've you been doing for these five years?

299
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:33,309
You didn't contacting me at all.

300
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:34,609
I was dead.

301
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:36,609
A man who only knew how to be a police detective

302
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:38,509
threw what he had away.

303
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:40,979
You could've become a detective too.

304
00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:43,309
You'd be of use right away.

305
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:46,409
I'll think about it.

306
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:48,987
Although we worked in different jurisdiction

307
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:50,989
and sections back in the old days,

308
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:54,993
we used to work as partners during investigation.

309
00:16:56,209 --> 00:17:00,209
Although he used to sometimes be hated unreasonably by his customers,

310
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:01,809
but the owner, Mr. Gamo...

311
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:04,109
"Reiji Tsuchida (43)" left everything up to me,

312
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:06,309
the hired president of this company.

313
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:09,007
Has he ever been hated aside of work?

314
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:12,109
He didn't talk to me about personal things.

315
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:14,809
Why don't you ask his nephew?

316
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:17,609
He seems to be the only one with blood ties with him.

317
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:26,609
Are you intending to make me the killer at all cost?

318
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:30,109
I would just like to confirm some things.

319
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:31,409
The night before last,

320
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:33,031
I was drawing pictures for a series

321
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:34,509
that is published in a weekly magazine.

322
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:36,409
Any witnesses?

323
00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:39,509
There isn't any because I live alone.

324
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:43,909
You sure seem to have loans here there and everywhere, don't you?

325
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:47,045
I heard an interesting story about you at a neighborhood bar.

326
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:49,709
You were wasted and babbling away saying,

327
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:54,809
"I would get inheritance if only uncle dies!"

328
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:57,055
I mean, I was drunk back then.

329
00:17:57,055 --> 00:18:00,409
Mr. Arai, let me just say one thing.

330
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:04,609
There is not one criminal who escaped the hands of me,

331
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:07,065
Kogoro Mouri, the renown detective.

332
00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:10,209
Go home!

333
00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:21,609
"Mouri Detective Agency"

334
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:22,809
And?

335
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:24,709
So, you got nothing after all?

336
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:27,809
Yes, only for today.

337
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,909
Come to think of it, that man called Mr. Arai

338
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:33,091
seemed to want the case to be a suicide, didn't he?

339
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:35,093
If it turns out to be a homicide,

340
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:37,095
he would be investigated from head to toe.

341
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:39,609
Then, all his shortcomings may be exposed.

342
00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:44,509
Hello.

343
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:46,809
Takeoka.

344
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:49,709
What? Something crossed your mind?

345
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:52,109
"Toyo Newspaper Agency" -You know that I can't tell you

346
00:18:52,109 --> 00:18:55,809
where I got information about Mr. Gamo calling you to work for him.

347
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:59,509
So, you can't give me info on the news source.

348
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:01,409
Well, it's not that I have no idea.

349
00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:03,409
If it's not the police,

350
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:06,209
the only person left is his nephew, Mr. Kyosuke Arai.

351
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:09,127
If you know, why come ask?

352
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:15,133
Prepare an article of apology for this fake info!

353
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:18,109
Just as you deduced,

354
00:19:18,109 --> 00:19:20,409
Arai was the one who let the info out.

355
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,809
He gets the entire estate to himself.

356
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:25,509
He has zero alibi.

357
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:29,147
Moreover, he uses the press to interfere with investigation.

358
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:30,909
I'll make him spit it out.

359
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,909
Don't tell me he got away.

360
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:42,109
"Arai"

361
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:48,009
Arai.

362
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:56,109
It seems that Mr. Arai's estimated time of death

363
00:19:56,109 --> 00:19:59,609
is around 9 pm to 10 pm last night.

364
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:01,179
It's suicide.

365
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:07,185
And, it's also proof that he's the guy who killed Mr. Gamo.

366
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:09,209
I totally agree too.

367
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:15,193
Inspector, this is his neighbor.

368
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:16,809
On the night that Mr. Gamo passed away,

369
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:18,909
she says that Mr. Arai was at home in his room.

370
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:20,009
What?

371
00:20:20,009 --> 00:20:21,199
Just what do you mean?

372
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:22,509
Since he was making a lot of noise,

373
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:24,909
I was going to complain to him.

374
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:27,205
I looked into his room from the veranda,

375
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:29,207
and saw him walking around in his room,

376
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:30,609
screaming something at the top of his lungs.

377
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:33,509
But, he cooled down in no time,

378
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:35,213
so I didn't say anything.

379
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:37,709
What time was it?

380
00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:39,609
A little before 8 pm.

381
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:40,809
8 pm?

382
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:42,409
It'll take at least an hour

383
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:45,223
and a half to get from here to the murder site.

384
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:47,509
If he was in his room at 8 pm,

385
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:49,909
he wouldn't have made it there at the estimated time of death

386
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:51,229
no matter how much he rushed.

387
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:52,909
Mr. Arai is innocent.

388
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:56,109
If so, there's only one possible reason

389
00:20:56,109 --> 00:20:59,009
why he committed suicide.

390
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:01,239
I suspected him despite him being innocent

391
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:04,709
cornered him and lead him to kill himself.

392
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:05,709
Thanks to your one-track mindedness,

393
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:09,509
I guess you did something that cannot be undone, Mr. Mouri.

394
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:12,009
I have no words to defend myself.

395
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:13,909
No, I'm the one who asked him

396
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:16,309
to go look for the killer together against his will.

397
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:21,009
I'll take responsibility for the outcome.

398
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:23,261
Mouri.

399
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,309
There're a lot of them again today.

400
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:29,809
I'm sorry, Mouri.

401
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:32,609
Don't worry about it.

402
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:37,909
I was happy just to be able to pair up with you like old times.

403
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:39,277
See you again, someday, then.

404
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:47,009
Mr. Arai who was falsely accused by you,

405
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:51,009
tried to prove his innocence by killing himself, didn't he?

406
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,209
Answer me, Mr. Mouri!

407
00:21:52,209 --> 00:21:55,909
You lead an innocent person to his death!

Going to resign?

He's going to resign his job as a detective?

Please, dad.
