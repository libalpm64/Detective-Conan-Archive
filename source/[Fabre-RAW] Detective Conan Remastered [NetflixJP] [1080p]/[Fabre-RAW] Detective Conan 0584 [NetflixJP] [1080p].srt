1
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:03,983
The encounter with a certain girl

2
00:00:04,225 --> 00:00:06,725
was what triggered Inspector Shiratori

3
00:00:06,725 --> 00:00:08,725
to become a police officer.

4
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:13,625
The Inspector was sure that the girl was Officer Sato,

5
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:15,995
however, it turns out that our homeroom teacher,

6
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:19,525
Ms. Kobayashi was that girl.

7
00:00:19,525 --> 00:00:22,425
Ms. Kobayashi happened to run into a murder being committed.

8
00:00:23,725 --> 00:00:24,925
The person who was killed

9
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:28,325
was the woman owner of a pawn shop named Ms. Akira Sumida.

10
00:00:28,325 --> 00:00:29,725
Many people seemed to have a grudge against her

11
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:32,625
for the evil way she did business.

12
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,525
Three clues were acquired from the questioning

13
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:38,017
that Ms. Kobayashi underwent with Inspector Shiratori.

14
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:40,025
The first, is the argument that she heard

15
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:42,725
at the site between the killer and the victim.

16
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:46,925
The second, was a mover's truck like vehicle

17
00:00:46,925 --> 00:00:49,025
that was parked near the scene of the crime.

18
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:54,925
And, the third was the silhouette of the killer

19
00:00:54,925 --> 00:00:56,725
that Ms. Kobayashi witnessed.

20
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:19,825
Brooding over passing seasons

21
00:01:19,825 --> 00:01:21,825
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

22
00:01:21,825 --> 00:01:23,625
Inspector Shiratori and Ms. Kobayashi.

23
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,825
Where is the case and love affair headed toward?

24
00:01:25,825 --> 00:01:27,425
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:27,425 --> 00:01:29,525
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:31,325
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

27
00:02:56,155 --> 00:03:00,976
"Inspector Shiratori's Heartbreak"

28
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:04,163
Like I said,

29
00:03:04,163 --> 00:03:07,476
I was at home alone watching TV.

30
00:03:07,476 --> 00:03:10,169
Because I soccer game that I didn't want to miss was on air.

31
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:12,976
"Kikuna Kagitan (25)" -If it hadn't been for that program,

32
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:14,776
I would've wanted to go killer her myself.

33
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:17,576
Did you hate her that much?

34
00:03:17,576 --> 00:03:19,876
Yes. I was hard up for money

35
00:03:19,876 --> 00:03:21,976
so I gave my mother's keepsake ring up to the pawn shop

36
00:03:21,976 --> 00:03:23,276
as reluctant as I was,

37
00:03:23,276 --> 00:03:25,076
but when I went to ask her to wait a while longer

38
00:03:25,076 --> 00:03:26,476
because I couldn't come up with enough money in time

39
00:03:26,476 --> 00:03:27,576
to buy back the ring,

40
00:03:27,576 --> 00:03:30,189
I saw her wearing the ring.

41
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:32,776
But, she told me, "If it's that cheap ring,

42
00:03:32,776 --> 00:03:34,476
it got bought right away.

43
00:03:34,476 --> 00:03:36,776
This ring looks like it, but it's a different one.

44
00:03:36,776 --> 00:03:39,876
It costs 20 times more than the other one too."

45
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:42,201
She had the nerve to say something like that!

46
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:44,576
How about it? You'd want to kill her too, wouldn't you?

47
00:03:44,576 --> 00:03:46,976
Well... no...

48
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,276
Inspector?

49
00:03:49,276 --> 00:03:51,776
"Ryoko Takimoto (31)" -I hope you're not thinking

50
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:53,276
that I killer her?

51
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:54,776
Well, no...

52
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,776
But, on the day that she was killed,

53
00:03:57,776 --> 00:03:59,576
you said you took off from work

54
00:03:59,576 --> 00:04:01,876
and was sleeping alone in your room.

55
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:03,976
I can't help it.

56
00:04:03,976 --> 00:04:07,176
My cold took a bad turn.

57
00:04:07,176 --> 00:04:10,229
And, what is your relationship with the victim?

58
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:12,676
I heard that you really hated her.

59
00:04:12,676 --> 00:04:15,276
I didn't really hate her.

60
00:04:15,276 --> 00:04:16,776
The antique plate that I bought

61
00:04:16,776 --> 00:04:21,076
from that pawn shop for 500,000 yen smelled funny,

62
00:04:21,076 --> 00:04:23,476
so I had an expert check on it and found...

63
00:04:23,476 --> 00:04:27,376
that it was a well-made replica costing 300 yen.

64
00:04:27,376 --> 00:04:30,776
Moreover, the smell that was on the plate was that of cat food,

65
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:35,276
because she fed her cat using that plate,

66
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:37,876
but I don't hate her at all.

67
00:04:42,276 --> 00:04:44,276
Yes, it's true

68
00:04:44,276 --> 00:04:48,267
that she loaned me money about 500,000 yen.

69
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:49,876
I finally came up with the cash

70
00:04:49,876 --> 00:04:51,876
and was ready to give it back to her,

71
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:54,676
but how can I now that she's dead.

72
00:04:54,676 --> 00:04:55,976
"Ryusuke Kodama (27)" -To proof my innocence,

73
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:58,277
the time that she is dead,

74
00:04:58,476 --> 00:05:02,676
I was drunk and totally out.

75
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:06,285
But, I heard that even the day before she was killed

76
00:05:06,476 --> 00:05:09,376
she went to your apartment shouting

77
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,176
that she wanted her money back.

78
00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:13,676
She was just putting on an act, an act.

79
00:05:13,676 --> 00:05:17,076
She used to put on that kind of act to come and see me.

80
00:05:17,076 --> 00:05:19,876
After all, I'm a former hero of high school baseball.

81
00:05:19,876 --> 00:05:22,976
Well, I hurt my left shoulder before

82
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:24,976
I was drafted and couldn't become a professional player,

83
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:27,476
so I don't think anyone remembers me though.

84
00:05:27,476 --> 00:05:28,876
In other words...

85
00:05:28,876 --> 00:05:32,311
That woman was in love with me.

86
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:34,313
Do you get it?

87
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:37,576
You're able to record the voices of all three suspects, right?

88
00:05:37,576 --> 00:05:38,876
Yes.

89
00:05:38,876 --> 00:05:41,276
All we need to do is to have Ms. Kobayashi check it

90
00:05:41,276 --> 00:05:42,776
and we're done.

91
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,876
Well, it seems that the killer is a woman,

92
00:05:45,876 --> 00:05:48,876
so I guess the man has nothing to do with the case.

93
00:05:48,876 --> 00:05:52,331
What kind of person is that Ms. Kobayashi?

94
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:53,976
I heard that Inspector Shiratori is head over

95
00:05:53,976 --> 00:05:55,976
heels over her from Yumi.

96
00:05:55,976 --> 00:05:57,476
She's Conan and the others homeroom teacher

97
00:05:57,476 --> 00:05:59,176
at their elementary school.

98
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:00,776
It seems that they coincidentally got to know each other the other day,

99
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:02,341
because of the incident.

100
00:06:03,576 --> 00:06:05,576
I was under the impression that Inspector Shiratori

101
00:06:05,576 --> 00:06:06,876
liked someone who was working

102
00:06:06,876 --> 00:06:09,876
inside the metropolitan police department here,

103
00:06:09,876 --> 00:06:11,776
but I guess I was mistaken.

104
00:06:12,776 --> 00:06:15,376
It was you, you.

105
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:18,357
At any rate, will you let me see her?

106
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:21,376
I think you'd be better off not seeing her.

107
00:06:21,376 --> 00:06:23,176
Why shouldn't I meet her?

108
00:06:23,176 --> 00:06:25,576
Well... That's because there are many things involved.

109
00:06:25,576 --> 00:06:27,776
A lot of things involved, is not an answer, is it?

110
00:06:27,776 --> 00:06:29,276
It's just not a good idea...

111
00:06:29,276 --> 00:06:31,576
She really is here.

112
00:06:31,576 --> 00:06:33,576
The one who looks just like me.

113
00:06:33,576 --> 00:06:35,176
If I remember correctly, her name is...

114
00:06:35,176 --> 00:06:37,976
Ms. Miwako Sato.

115
00:06:37,976 --> 00:06:39,476
How envious...

116
00:06:39,476 --> 00:06:43,076
I wanted to be a woman detective too.

117
00:06:43,076 --> 00:06:47,076
Really, that Takagi is making lovey dovey again

118
00:06:47,076 --> 00:06:49,376
with our Miwako.

119
00:06:53,076 --> 00:06:54,976
I think he's getting carried away

120
00:06:54,976 --> 00:06:57,276
because Shiratori backed off.

121
00:06:57,276 --> 00:06:58,397
Yes.

122
00:06:58,397 --> 00:07:04,776
After all, he was the top in charge of protecting Miwako Sato.

123
00:07:04,776 --> 00:07:07,976
Shiratori, really made out, didn't he?

124
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:11,876
Yes. I didn't think she would look that much like Sato.

125
00:07:11,876 --> 00:07:14,776
I wonder if there's another one somewhere?

126
00:07:14,776 --> 00:07:17,976
-That teacher's the last. -Yes, right?

127
00:07:17,976 --> 00:07:19,676
Ms. Kobayashi.

128
00:07:19,676 --> 00:07:20,776
Thank you for waiting.

129
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,176
What's the matter, Ms. Kobayashi?

130
00:07:26,776 --> 00:07:27,876
Ms. Kobayashi?

131
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:35,376
"This ring looks like it, but it's a different one.

132
00:07:35,376 --> 00:07:38,437
It costs 20 times more than the other one too."

133
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:40,439
She had the nerve to say something like that!

134
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:44,776
How about it? You'd want to kill her too, wouldn't you?

135
00:07:44,776 --> 00:07:49,176
This is the voice of the first suspect, Ms. Kikuna Kagitani.

136
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:50,176
I see.

137
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:54,776
This next one is...

138
00:07:54,776 --> 00:07:58,076
Moreover, the smell that was on the plate was that of cat food,

139
00:07:58,076 --> 00:08:02,476
because she fed her cat using that plate,

140
00:08:02,476 --> 00:08:06,465
but I don't hate her at all!

141
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:10,076
The voice of the second suspect, Ms. Ryoko Takimoto.

142
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:11,576
I see.

143
00:08:11,576 --> 00:08:14,473
And, the next one is the voice of the third suspect

144
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:16,276
Mr. Ryusuke Kodama.

145
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:19,476
Well, I don't think he's part of it

146
00:08:19,476 --> 00:08:21,176
because he is a man, but just to be safe.

147
00:08:21,176 --> 00:08:23,976
If he's not part of it, why bother?

148
00:08:26,776 --> 00:08:28,487
I see.

149
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:31,876
So, out of the two voices of the women

150
00:08:31,876 --> 00:08:34,493
you just listened to do you remember hearing either one?

151
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:37,076
The voice that you heard at the scene of the crime,

152
00:08:37,076 --> 00:08:40,499
which voice sounded like the shouting of the killer?

153
00:08:42,276 --> 00:08:43,976
I selected and had you listen to the part

154
00:08:43,976 --> 00:08:47,976
where both women got excited during the interrogation.

155
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:51,676
Teacher.

156
00:08:51,676 --> 00:08:53,076
What's wrong?

157
00:08:53,076 --> 00:08:55,276
You heard the voice of the killer, didn't you?

158
00:08:56,876 --> 00:09:00,276
I think it was different from either of their voices.

159
00:09:00,276 --> 00:09:05,876
The woman's voice I heard was lower and gruffer.

160
00:09:05,876 --> 00:09:07,676
I see.

161
00:09:07,676 --> 00:09:10,876
So, I think you should look for another suspect

162
00:09:10,876 --> 00:09:13,376
or that it would be better if you talk to the person

163
00:09:13,376 --> 00:09:16,535
who was driving the mover-like truck

164
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:18,537
that I saw move away.

165
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:21,476
About that vehicle...

166
00:09:21,476 --> 00:09:23,276
We can't find it

167
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:27,276
a car with large prints of "0" and "9" on it.

168
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:28,876
No.

169
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:33,976
Maybe you saw different numbers?

170
00:09:33,976 --> 00:09:35,476
If the wall was in the way and blocked

171
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:39,176
you vision "5" and "9" resemble each other.

172
00:09:39,176 --> 00:09:40,559
Just because they look alike,

173
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,561
I wouldn't make a mistake!

174
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:44,563
Not me!

175
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:45,876
"Not me"?

176
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:50,576
Well, it could be that the car stopped

177
00:09:50,576 --> 00:09:53,476
by there because of something besides work too.

178
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:57,176
Of course, we took that into consideration too

179
00:09:57,176 --> 00:09:59,776
and pried deeper.

180
00:09:59,776 --> 00:10:02,576
Moreover, we asked the residents

181
00:10:02,576 --> 00:10:04,576
who live in the vicinity too.

182
00:10:04,576 --> 00:10:07,676
Nobody seems to have called the movers

183
00:10:07,676 --> 00:10:09,276
or a delivery truck either.

184
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,076
Then are you saying that...

185
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:13,276
I'm saying something unreliable,

186
00:10:13,276 --> 00:10:14,593
leading the police into confusion,

187
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:18,076
and making fun of all of you here at the station?

188
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,376
No way.

189
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:24,603
I've already told you everything

190
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:26,376
that I've seen and heard, so...

191
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,676
if you will excuse me, I would like to leave.

192
00:10:27,676 --> 00:10:30,276
Let me drive you home.

193
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:33,276
There's a possibility that you may run into the suspects too, so...

194
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:36,376
I'll be fine.

195
00:10:36,376 --> 00:10:40,176
I can very well take of myself, thank you.

196
00:10:40,176 --> 00:10:43,876
Will you please let me be already?

197
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,176
Goodbye.

198
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:47,976
Mr. Shiratori.

199
00:10:47,976 --> 00:10:50,629
Teacher.

200
00:10:50,876 --> 00:10:52,631
Inspector Shiratori.

201
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:56,076
I think you should take Ms. Kobayashi home.

202
00:10:56,076 --> 00:10:58,637
After all, the killer has seen her face.

203
00:10:58,876 --> 00:11:00,639
Yes.

204
00:11:00,876 --> 00:11:02,176
Officer Chiba,

205
00:11:02,176 --> 00:11:03,476
could I ask you to take her home?

206
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:06,645
Sure, but are you sure about it?

207
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:08,076
Yes.

208
00:11:08,076 --> 00:11:11,376
It seems that she doesn't like me anymore.

209
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:14,653
Ms. Kobayashi! Please wait.

210
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,376
Hey, you!

211
00:11:19,576 --> 00:11:22,176
Why doesn't she like you anymore?

212
00:11:22,176 --> 00:11:23,976
Did you say something you shouldn't have to her?

213
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,576
I have no idea.

214
00:11:25,576 --> 00:11:28,667
There's only one thing thinkable.

215
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:32,676
I think it's because Ms. Kobayashi met Officer Sato.

216
00:11:32,676 --> 00:11:37,276
What? Ms. Kobayashi met Officer Sato?

217
00:11:37,276 --> 00:11:39,776
In addition, if she found out that you

218
00:11:39,776 --> 00:11:42,676
were head over heels over Officer Sato,

219
00:11:42,676 --> 00:11:44,683
I'm sure that Ms. Kobayashi would think

220
00:11:44,876 --> 00:11:47,876
Inspector Shiratori is kind to her

221
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:50,376
only because she looks like Officer Sato.

222
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:54,176
That maybe she was just a substitute for Officer Sato.

223
00:11:54,176 --> 00:11:57,576
No, Ms. Kobayashi is not a substitute,

224
00:11:57,576 --> 00:12:00,376
but rather, she's my destiny.

225
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:04,276
But, it's a fact that you mistook the woman of your destiny

226
00:12:04,276 --> 00:12:05,776
for Officer Sato, right?

227
00:12:05,776 --> 00:12:08,276
I don't mean to deny that but...

228
00:12:08,276 --> 00:12:11,276
I think it's about time you tell her, don't you?

229
00:12:11,276 --> 00:12:13,776
That Ms. Kobayashi is the person of your destiny

230
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:16,376
who during your childhood,

231
00:12:16,376 --> 00:12:18,717
you tried to protect at a bookstore from some shoplifters.

232
00:12:18,876 --> 00:12:22,721
Of course, I feel that way too, but...

233
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:25,576
I couldn't find the right timing to tell her about it.

234
00:12:25,576 --> 00:12:28,376
Hello! Inspector in love.

235
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:30,729
How were the voices of the suspects?

236
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:32,176
She already listened to them, didn't she?

237
00:12:32,176 --> 00:12:37,276
Yes, but it seems that none of them had the voice she heard.

238
00:12:37,276 --> 00:12:38,276
Is that so?

239
00:12:38,276 --> 00:12:41,976
And? Where's the teacher that Shiratori is head over heels over?

240
00:12:41,976 --> 00:12:43,276
Well...

241
00:12:43,276 --> 00:12:46,745
Since you said that you wanted to meet her at all cost.

242
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:48,747
Mr. Shiratori?

243
00:12:49,676 --> 00:12:50,749
That...

244
00:12:53,976 --> 00:12:58,757
Well... I don't think I should, at least not right now.

245
00:12:58,757 --> 00:12:59,576
What?

246
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:08,767
"Next day in school"

247
00:13:09,627 --> 00:13:10,769
Goodbye.

248
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:12,427
-Bye, teacher! -Bye, teacher!

249
00:13:12,427 --> 00:13:14,027
Yes, goodbye.

250
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,927
Bye, teacher!

251
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:18,427
Goodbye, don't run, it's dangerous!

252
00:13:18,427 --> 00:13:20,327
Okay!

253
00:13:24,227 --> 00:13:26,127
Teacher, doesn't look too cheerful.

254
00:13:26,127 --> 00:13:28,027
I wonder if she hasn't heard

255
00:13:28,027 --> 00:13:31,127
from Inspector Shiratori that she's the woman of his destiny.

256
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:34,227
Okay, maybe I should go tell her then?

257
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:35,827
No!

258
00:13:35,827 --> 00:13:39,127
It's not romantic unless he tells her himself!

259
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:44,527
But, if left as is, she'll probably end up never knowing.

260
00:13:44,527 --> 00:13:46,805
Well, maybe all for the better?

261
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:49,727
After all there's a great big liar who's not disclosing his identity

262
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:51,727
for the longest time even to the one he loves.

263
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:52,827
Hey.

264
00:13:52,827 --> 00:13:55,827
But, I wonder why the person

265
00:13:55,827 --> 00:13:57,327
with the killer's voice wasn't there?

266
00:13:57,327 --> 00:14:01,627
Yes. I heard that there were only three suspects

267
00:14:01,627 --> 00:14:03,927
who had a grudge against the victim Mrs. Sumida

268
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,127
as well as not have an alibi.

269
00:14:05,127 --> 00:14:06,825
Three people.

270
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:09,627
We only heard the voices of two people, right?

271
00:14:09,627 --> 00:14:11,627
That's why...

272
00:14:11,627 --> 00:14:14,227
the third suspect is a man, they cut him out

273
00:14:14,227 --> 00:14:18,527
because the voice that teacher heard was that of a woman!

274
00:14:18,527 --> 00:14:20,327
By the way...

275
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:22,627
Mr. Ryunosuke Kodama who was cut out

276
00:14:22,627 --> 00:14:26,527
used to be a hot high school baseball player

277
00:14:26,527 --> 00:14:29,527
but he hurt his shoulder and wasn't drafted.

278
00:14:29,527 --> 00:14:33,227
He seems to be working at a host club now.

279
00:14:33,227 --> 00:14:35,727
But, unable to give up his dream,

280
00:14:35,727 --> 00:14:37,827
he was trying to get up the ladder

281
00:14:37,827 --> 00:14:40,427
joining a baseball club team in between his work time.

282
00:14:40,427 --> 00:14:43,727
But, he seriously hurt his shoulder again

283
00:14:43,727 --> 00:14:46,427
and this time had to really give up playing.

284
00:14:47,627 --> 00:14:49,227
You really know the details, don't you?

285
00:14:49,227 --> 00:14:51,827
Yes. Because after that,

286
00:14:51,827 --> 00:14:53,527
Officer Takagi gave me the details.

287
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:55,527
Then, what about the remaining two?

288
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,327
Let's see... the first one,

289
00:14:57,327 --> 00:15:00,427
Ms. Kikuna Kagitani is unemployed.

290
00:15:00,427 --> 00:15:02,427
She was previously the leader of a women motorbike gang.

291
00:15:02,427 --> 00:15:04,527
But, she got into an accident and hurt someone,

292
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:06,885
so her driver's license is suspended for now.

293
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:08,887
Leader of a motorbike gang?

294
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:11,627
Yes, if she calls out,

295
00:15:11,627 --> 00:15:14,127
she could easily gather at least 100 people.

296
00:15:14,127 --> 00:15:17,727
Maybe she's the killer?

297
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:19,927
I wonder... But, because of that accident,

298
00:15:19,927 --> 00:15:22,127
she had to come up with fee for court

299
00:15:22,127 --> 00:15:24,627
as well as gratuity cash, so she was in need of money.

300
00:15:24,627 --> 00:15:26,027
What about the last one?

301
00:15:26,027 --> 00:15:26,905
Yeah.

302
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:30,909
Ms. Ryoko Takimoto is the owner of a Japanese cuisine restaurant

303
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:32,911
and daughter of a rich family.

304
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:34,527
It seems that she was deceived

305
00:15:34,527 --> 00:15:36,127
into buying a plate worth nothing,

306
00:15:36,127 --> 00:15:38,227
and in order to get back the cash she paid for it,

307
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:40,227
she dished out a large amount of cash

308
00:15:40,227 --> 00:15:41,727
to hire an attorney in preparation

309
00:15:41,727 --> 00:15:44,923
to charge a complaint against Ms. Sumida who was killed.

310
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:48,527
Well, she seems to have been having discussions with her lawyers,

311
00:15:48,527 --> 00:15:50,027
not even taking time out for sleeping and caught a cold.

312
00:15:50,027 --> 00:15:52,427
The last time she was summoned by the police,

313
00:15:52,427 --> 00:15:54,527
she was also wearing a mask.

314
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:55,727
A mask?

315
00:15:55,727 --> 00:15:59,427
I see. She deliberately wore a mask to hide her voice.

316
00:15:59,427 --> 00:16:01,727
I thought the same thing in the beginning too,

317
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,943
but the masks nowadays are thin and let the voice through.

318
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:08,227
Her voice didn't sound muffled either.

319
00:16:08,227 --> 00:16:11,827
But, if the voice of the killer that teacher heard was that of a woman,

320
00:16:11,827 --> 00:16:16,027
and if one of the two of them is the killer,

321
00:16:16,027 --> 00:16:18,127
then wouldn't the one who was wearing the mask

322
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:20,227
be the most suspicious?

323
00:16:20,227 --> 00:16:24,127
That's what's bothering me.

324
00:16:24,127 --> 00:16:26,965
How did Ms. Kobayashi know that it was the voice of the killer

325
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:28,967
when all she did was hear the voice?

326
00:16:29,127 --> 00:16:30,969
Of course, she would know.

327
00:16:31,127 --> 00:16:33,327
Because the woman shouted,

328
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:36,627
"Give that to me. I'll kill you!"

329
00:16:36,627 --> 00:16:39,427
Besides, Ms. Kobayashi said that the killer who got away,

330
00:16:39,427 --> 00:16:41,427
had pretty big breasts.

331
00:16:41,427 --> 00:16:44,983
But, the victim Ms. Sumida is also a woman.

332
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:50,427
It could be that Ms. Sumida was the one who said, "I'll kill you."

333
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,727
Right. After being told, "I'll kill you"...

334
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:53,927
The person may have in an act of aggression

335
00:16:53,927 --> 00:16:55,627
from fear took drastic action.

336
00:16:55,627 --> 00:16:58,027
And the car that Ms. Kobayashi said

337
00:16:58,027 --> 00:17:02,127
that she saw move away with the number "0" and "9" on it...

338
00:17:02,127 --> 00:17:04,127
Why can't it be found?

339
00:17:05,627 --> 00:17:08,027
There was no number on the car of the person

340
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,009
that doctor helped move the other day either.

341
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:13,527
Did you see that car?

342
00:17:13,527 --> 00:17:16,327
No. I asked, just in case.

343
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:19,427
Whether there were any numbers on the car.

344
00:17:19,427 --> 00:17:23,727
The name of the mover was "Osaka Niko Niko Transport Co."

345
00:17:23,727 --> 00:17:24,827
It had no number on it,

346
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:27,427
just the name of the company in big print.

347
00:17:27,427 --> 00:17:30,727
Company name... was it?

348
00:17:30,727 --> 00:17:34,027
Doctor said that the driver of the truck

349
00:17:34,027 --> 00:17:35,927
wasn't used to Tokyo,

350
00:17:35,927 --> 00:17:37,527
and the car navigator was not working too well either,

351
00:17:37,527 --> 00:17:39,327
so he got lost.

352
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,027
Then, they started moving after 8 pm,

353
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,227
so it was a lot of trouble.

354
00:17:44,227 --> 00:17:45,727
Genta.

355
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,227
You've been in deep for some time now.

356
00:17:48,227 --> 00:17:51,327
Is something bothering you?

357
00:17:51,327 --> 00:17:54,027
What? No...

358
00:17:54,027 --> 00:17:57,055
My cavity hurts so I was just holding it down.

359
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:58,227
A cavity?

360
00:17:58,227 --> 00:17:59,327
You've been talking about it

361
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:01,059
from before summer vacation, haven't you?

362
00:18:01,227 --> 00:18:03,627
I don't like going to the dentist.

363
00:18:03,627 --> 00:18:06,727
Then, just stop posing in a way

364
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:09,627
to make others worry and hurry on off to the dentist.

365
00:18:09,627 --> 00:18:13,071
I see... Maybe...

366
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,827
Inspector Shiratori?

367
00:18:16,827 --> 00:18:19,077
What brings you here?

368
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:21,427
Haven't I already told you

369
00:18:21,427 --> 00:18:23,081
that I have nothing more to tell the police?

370
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:25,427
Yes, but...

371
00:18:25,427 --> 00:18:28,027
after checking a lot of things since then,

372
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:30,127
we've come to the conclusion that the suspects that we've come up

373
00:18:30,127 --> 00:18:33,091
with are the only ones that could be the killer.

374
00:18:33,327 --> 00:18:34,527
So, will you please listen

375
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:35,927
to the voices of the three suspects once again?

376
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:38,027
There's no need for that.

377
00:18:38,027 --> 00:18:39,097
I already told you, didn't I?

378
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:42,227
That no one in the voice that I heard in the recorder

379
00:18:42,227 --> 00:18:43,827
matched the voice of the killer.

380
00:18:43,827 --> 00:18:46,327
Or, are you accusing me of lying?

381
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:48,527
I'm lying.

382
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,327
Me wanting you to confirm the voices

383
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:54,127
of the suspects again is just an excuse.

384
00:18:54,127 --> 00:18:58,327
I really came to see you.

385
00:18:58,327 --> 00:19:00,327
To undo the misunderstanding between us.

386
00:19:00,327 --> 00:19:03,427
I haven't misunderstood anything.

387
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:05,827
Looks good!

388
00:19:05,827 --> 00:19:08,527
Go for it, Inspector Shiratori!

389
00:19:08,527 --> 00:19:12,627
The fact is, the incident that occurred the other day

390
00:19:12,627 --> 00:19:15,427
is not the first time I saw you.

391
00:19:15,427 --> 00:19:18,727
I've met you long, long time ago.

392
00:19:18,727 --> 00:19:20,827
The little girl that stopped some boys

393
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,627
from shoplifting in a bookstore.

394
00:19:23,627 --> 00:19:26,127
Bookstore? Shoplifting?

395
00:19:26,127 --> 00:19:27,627
Yes.

396
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:30,727
I was moved by that girl.

397
00:19:30,727 --> 00:19:33,627
That's why I became a police officer.

398
00:19:33,627 --> 00:19:36,727
After seeing how courageous you were.

399
00:19:36,727 --> 00:19:39,527
Courageous... Police officer...

400
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:45,163
How about it? Do you remember?

401
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:48,227
No. I'm sorry, but I don't remember.

402
00:19:48,227 --> 00:19:49,167
What?

403
00:19:49,327 --> 00:19:51,727
Besides, isn't that girl...

404
00:19:51,727 --> 00:19:55,173
I think you've mistaken Officer Sato for me, haven't you?

405
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,175
No, that's...

406
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:59,177
If you will excuse me...

407
00:19:59,427 --> 00:20:00,927
Wait.

408
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:05,183
Teacher.

409
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:22,927
Goodbye, Ms. Kobayashi.

410
00:20:22,927 --> 00:20:24,827
I'll be leaving now,

411
00:20:24,827 --> 00:20:27,227
so please make sure you lock all the doors.

412
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,527
Yes.

413
00:20:29,527 --> 00:20:30,827
Goodbye.

414
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:32,327
Bye.

415
00:20:52,327 --> 00:20:53,627
"Incoming call, 8:27 pm"

416
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:03,241
Yes, this is Teitan Elementary.

417
00:21:03,427 --> 00:21:05,243
I'm sorry to be calling so late.

418
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:07,027
I'm calling from the police.

419
00:21:07,027 --> 00:21:09,247
May I speak to Ms. Kobayashi please?

420
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,827
I'm Kobayashi.

421
00:21:11,827 --> 00:21:14,327
I said I have nothing more to tell the police.

422
00:21:14,327 --> 00:21:16,727
The car with the numbers "0" and "9"

423
00:21:16,727 --> 00:21:20,427
that you witnessed has been found.

424
00:21:20,427 --> 00:21:21,727
We've taken a picture of it,

425
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:23,527
so I was wondering if you could confirm it.

426
00:21:23,527 --> 00:21:28,627
Yes. Then please come with that picture at a later date.

427
00:21:28,627 --> 00:21:31,727
No, since I wanted you to confirm it right away,

428
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:34,027
I had the guard open the gate for me,

429
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:35,273
and I'm already in the school building.

430
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:37,275
I see.

431
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:39,277
Then, please come to the teachers' room.

432
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:41,279
How about the music room?

433
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:43,727
The thing is, this is my alma mater,

434
00:21:43,727 --> 00:21:45,627
and I used to belong to the brass band club.

435
00:21:45,627 --> 00:21:48,927
I felt so nostalgic that I was looking around here and there.

436
00:21:48,927 --> 00:21:50,927
Really?

437
00:21:50,927 --> 00:21:52,627
I'll see you in the music room, then.

438
00:21:52,627 --> 00:21:54,527
Yes, I'll be waiting for you.

439
00:21:56,327 --> 00:21:58,727
This school is his alma mater?

440
00:21:58,727 --> 00:22:01,727
I wonder what year he graduated.

441
00:22:01,727 --> 00:22:05,303
Maybe he used to be my classmate.

442
00:22:15,027 --> 00:22:19,027
But the music room was renovated last year

443
00:22:19,027 --> 00:22:21,827
and all the walls and desks were changed,

444
00:22:21,827 --> 00:22:23,927
so how could he feel nostalgic?

445
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:30,127
Besides, his voice just now sounds familiar.

446
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

447
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,440
"Giraffe".
