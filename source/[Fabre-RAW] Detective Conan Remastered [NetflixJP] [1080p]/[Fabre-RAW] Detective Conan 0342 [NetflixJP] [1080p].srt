1
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,140
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,240
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,740
Today's episode is a 60 minutes long special.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,740
The bell of crime tolls at Huis Ten Bosch.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,240
His name is Detective Conan!

"Wide Map of Huis Ten Bosch"

9
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,130
Wedding at Huis Ten Bosch.

10
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,130
It's so romantic.

11
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,330
I've always wanted to go to Huis Ten Bosch.

12
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,030
But, Sonoko, are you sure it was okay

13
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,330
for us to come along, too?

14
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,730
Are you sure it's not going to inconvenience anyone?

15
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,830
It's okay because I'd be bored if I went alone,

16
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,030
and besides, just in case something happens,

17
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,530
you're nice to have around.

18
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,730
In case something happens?

19
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,330
Well, this wedding

20
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,830
seems to have had a lot of hassles before it came to be.

21
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:44,530
But, Shinya and I have been friends since we just started walking.

22
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,130
And there was even a time

23
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,830
when people were thinking of getting us to marry each other.

24
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,630
It's not only because of that,

25
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,430
but I really want him to attain the happiness he deserves.

26
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,930
You're cool, Sonoko.

27
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,430
Drinks?

28
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,630
Conan, would you like anything to drink?

29
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,030
Yes.

30
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,030
Excuse me!

31
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,230
Yes.

32
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,930
I think I'll have...

33
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,830
-Excuse me, oolong tea please. -Please give me oolong tea.

34
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,830
Yes.

35
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:23,830
I'm sorry, but this is the last can of oolong tea that is left.

36
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,130
Then, go ahead and take it, sonny!

37
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,030
No, you order the drink faster than me, so you can have it.

38
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,030
Really?

39
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,030
Thank you for letting me have it.

40
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,630
Thank you very much.

41
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,730
Please give me one of those paper cups.

42
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,330
Okay.

43
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,630
Here you go, sonny.

44
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,230
Thank you!

45
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,830
Thank you so much.

46
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,830
No problem.

47
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,730
Thank you very much.

48
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,730
Coffee and tea, any orders for drinks?

"Junichi Takahashi (27)" -Sister and brother traveling together?

50
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,030
How nice.

51
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,030
No, we are not siblings.

52
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,630
I wonder why each time I invite Ran to come with me,

53
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:13,030
this kid with the glasses tags along, too?

54
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,630
Sonoko, would you like a sip?

55
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,430
It can't be helped,

56
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,530
because if I'm not around, Conan won't be able to eat his meals.

57
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,630
Right?

58
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,930
Hey, Sonoko.

59
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,730
Gosh, what's bugging you?

60
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,830
I guess I'll try to stay off her nerves at least just for today.

63
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,930
You...

64
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,330
You're the one we met in the Bullet train.

65
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,330
Well, what a coincidence.

66
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,530
So, you're all going to Huis Ten Bosch, too.

67
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,530
Yes.

68
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,730
Are you sightseeing alone?

69
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:12,430
Yes, please don't look at me with such sympathetic eyes.

70
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,130
Then, why don't you come with us?

71
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,530
-Is it okay? -Sure.

72
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,630
How delightful to be able to go around together

73
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,330
with cute girls like you.

74
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,130
Are you sure you don't mind?

75
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,930
But, the escort fee is expensive.

76
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,830
Only joking. Just kidding.

77
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,630
-You really surprised me. -Come off it, Sonoko.

78
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,030
How much longer are you guys going to take?

79
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,830
We're really at Huis Ten Bosche, aren't we?

80
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,430
It's so spacious.

81
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,830
It sure doesn't look like we're in Japan.

82
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,930
Sonoko!

83
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,630
There they are! Shinya, long time no see!

84
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,430
Thank you for coming all the way out here.

85
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,430
It's okay because I came to go sightseeing while I'm here, too.

86
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,730
She's my best friend, Ran and he's Conan.

I'm Ran Mouri, how do you do?

88

I'm Conan.

I'm Akane Katori. Nice to meet you.

92

What a beautiful girl.

93
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,130
I'll be on my way then.

94
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,030
Thank you so very much.

95
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,630
Who is he?

96
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,930
His name is Mr. Takahashi,

97
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,530
and he's someone we got to know on the train.

98

Let's go now.

99
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,730
Look, there's a windmill!

100
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,730
This is Delft Bridge.

101
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,630
Look, there's a swan.

102
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,130
How graceful.

103
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,230
It's like we've really come to Holland.

104
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,230
I'd really love to go.

105
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,830
Now you know why me and my family

106
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,730
chose to have our wedding here, don't you?

107
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,630
You should have your wedding here

108
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,430
at Huis Ten Bosch too, Sonoko.

109
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,430
What? I'm still in high school.

110
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,430
But, I'll think about it when the time comes.

111
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,930
Hey, how far in the future is that?

"Hotel Europe"

Dad, I brought Sonoko and her friends along.

114
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,130
Hello, Miss Sonoko.

115
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:50,130
Thank you so much for coming all this way just for us.

116
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,130
Oh, my. How you've grown, Sonoko.

117
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,330
I'll bet you're tired.

118
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,630
No, not at all, Mrs. Ohga.

119
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:59,130
I'm not at all tired, because I'm young.

120
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,430
Oh, my.

121
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:05,530
This is my best friend, Ran, and he is Conan.

122
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,930
I accepted Sonoko's kind offer and came along.

123
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,830
Nice to meet you.

"Mika Ohga (29)" -I was just thinking...

125
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,930
"Shinya's sister" -that it was kind of sad with so little attendance,

126
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,230
because it seems that nobody will be attending

127
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,830
from the bride's side.

128
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,530
Come, Mika, don't talk like that in front of our guests.

131
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,730
Yes, he's just fine and playing golf every day.

132
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,230
You seem to be doing really well yourself, Grandma Tae.

133
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,430
Thank you.

134
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,730
Since I have no successor

135
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:42,330
that I can rely on and entrust the Ohga Financial Group to,

136
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,930
I've got to stay healthy and keep on working.

Hey, Ran! Do you think this would look nice on Mr. Kyogyoku?

139
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,130
They're all okay.

140
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,730
I wonder if Shinichi had one like this?

141
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,230
Oh, brother.

142
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,530
Here goes, Conan!

143
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,030

"Stad Huis"

145
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,030
Hi, there.

146
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,530
Did you already go take a look at the Glass Museum?

147
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,730
No. I just got here, too.

148
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,130
Sonoko, it's Grandma Tae and Ms. Mika.

149
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,430
Grandma likes antique glass.

150
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,130
Conan, take a look at this.

151
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,130
17th Century, it says.

152
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,430
So glass has been around from that long ago.

153
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,630
In Egypt, they seem to have been

154
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,630
making glass decorations since 3000 A.D.

155
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,330
It's been around from that long ago.

156
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,130
During the time of the Roman Empire,

157
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,630
the blown glass method was invented,

158
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,330
and it's also said that they even had window glasses.

159
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,830
Really?

160
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,830
You're quite knowledgeable, aren't you?

161
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:40,930
Well, I'm a glass craftsman from Hotaru, Hokkaido.

162
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,430
I took time off from work,

163
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,230
and came here wanting to see the glassworks of Nagasaki.

164
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,730
I see.

165
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,130
My liking for glass

166
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,630
developed into my having a glass workshop in the city.

167
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:56,330
What do you say, we have dinner together tonight?

168
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,930
I'd like to hear about glass in Hotaru, too.

169
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,230
I would like to by all means if you don't mind.

170
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,330
My name is Takahashi.

171
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,730
"Dom Tower"

172
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,530
How tall.

173
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,530
The town is like a toy!

174
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,730
What a nice view.

175
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,430
Aren't you afraid?

176
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:19,330
I always used to like high places.

177
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:24,030
See, the people walking below look like swarming ants.

178
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,530
Doesn't it just make you feel so good?

179
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:57,030
This is Mr. Takahashi, a glass craftsman from Hotaru.

180
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:01,030
I invited him over because I wanted to hear his story on glass.

181
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,430
I'm Takahashi.

182
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,630
I'm Ohga.

183
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,830
My son, Shinya's wedding is tomorrow,

184
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,130
and that's why we're all spending the night here.

185
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,730
You're most welcome.

186
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,330
"Hideo Mochida (53)" -I never thought it'd be Shinya...

187
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,130
"Shinya's uncle" -that would end up marrying first.

188
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,130
Mika, he beat you to it, didn't he?

189
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,330
That's because I don't buy cheap stuff.

190
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,530
Oh, right. Mr. Takahashi,

191
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:29,630
I'd like to invite you to attend tomorrow's wedding.

192
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,930
But, I really shouldn't...

193
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,830
You're more than welcome to.

194
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:39,230
Shinya will have to shoulder the Ohga Finance Group in the future.

195
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,930
I'm sure that attending the wedding will not be a loss to you, too.

196
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,330
How can I attend the wedding?

197
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,530
I'm just a glass craftsman...

198
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:51,030
Yes, I'll accept your invitation and attend the wedding with honor.

199
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,730
Thank you.

200
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:58,930
Akane, wear this at your wedding tomorrow.

201
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,630
This is a ring that has been handed down for generations

202
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,230
to the wives of the Ohga family.

203
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:14,030
The founding president who started a shipping industry

204
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,730
at the beginning of the Meiji Era gave this to his wife

205
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,730
when he first went to Europe.

206
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,630
Thank you very much.

207
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,330
Thank you, mother.

208
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,730
Maybe it's too soon to give it to her yet.

209
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,630
But, I also received it from you

210
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,430
and wore it to the wedding.

211
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,430
It's because in your case, everyone had viewed you

212
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:38,230
as being the right person as the wife of the family head, to begin with.

213
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,430
The only time the ring is to be handed down,

214
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,530
is when the bride is approved of

215
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,130
as becoming a member of the Ohga family.

216
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:50,230
Which means you all don't approve of Akane as being my wife?

217
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:57,330
Well, she can wear it during the wedding ceremony, though.

218
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:06,330
It seems like we've been invited to a hassle wedding.

219
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,330
What the hell was that?

220
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,930
Is that how the family of somebody

221
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,830
who is going to have a sacred wedding tomorrow supposed to act?

222
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,830
What the hell's going on, Sonoko?

223
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,130
I told you that they went through a bit of a hassle

224
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,830
before the wedding was decided, didn't I?

225
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,930
Sonoko, why is that grandmother so mean to Ms. Akane?

226
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,630
Shinya declared that if they didn't approve

227
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,630
of him marrying Ms. Akane, he would leave home.

228
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,630
So, it seems the Ohga family all reluctantly approved.

229
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,830
But Ms. Akane is such a nice person.

230
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,030
The family of a financial group has all kinds of hassles.

231
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,330
What? You mean they don't like her family lineage?

232
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,630
And it seems grandma doesn't like the fact

233
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,630
that she's two years older than him either.

234
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,430
That's nonsense. There's no reason to be mean to her.

235
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,130
Hey, the show's started!

236
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:21,630
Ran, I'm going to go over that side and watch.

237
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,130
Be careful, okay?

238
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,030
Gosh.

239
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,530
It sure is inconvenient to have a small body at times like these.

240
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:44,330
That's Ms. Akane and Mr. Takahashi?

241
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:02,030
"Palace Huis Ten Bosch"

242
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:13,730
Ms. Akane, you look fantastic.

243
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,630
You can say that again. You look just marvelous.

244
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,430
Ms. Akane, make sure you throw me the bouquet

245
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,330
after the wedding ceremony, okay? Please, promise now.

246
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,830
All right, I'm not sure if I'll be able to aim right,

247
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,530
but I'll try my best.

248
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,530
Only an hour more to go before the wedding.

249
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,130
Ms. Akane is so beautiful!

250
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,530
Hey, Shinya, how about a word to the bride?

251
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,730
Yes.

252
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,630
You look really dazzling.

253
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,830
Talk about hot, hot.

254
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,230
Come on, Sonoko.

255
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:01,130
Shinya, how unsightly of you to be entranced by your bride.

256
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,830
Stay in your waiting room until it's time for the wedding.

257
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,630
Akane.

258
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,830
I will take on the role of the bride's father.

259
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,430
Thank you so...

260
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,930
It's your foot, mister. I think you stepped on this.

261
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,230
Is that it?

262
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,730
I'm so sorry, really sorry.

263
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,430
This picture, are they your parents, Ms. Akane?

264
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,630
Yes.

265
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,630
Grandma!

266
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,830
-Grandma! -My heart's just started throbbing a bit.

267
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,330
I'll get better after a little rest.

268
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,630
Here. Grab my shoulder.

269
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,530
Rest a while till it's time for the ceremony.

270
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,430
I wonder if Grandma Tae's okay?

271
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,830
I hope it's nothing serious.

272
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,830
I'm fine.

273
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,030
But...

274
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,530
What's the matter, Conan?

275
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:32,430
Ms. Akane, do you have the ring?

276
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,030
No.

277
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,830
The ring is gone.

278
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,730
The ring really is...

279
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,130
It's gone!

280
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,530
What's this?

281
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,930
You're in it, Ms. Akane.

282
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,130
Look.

283
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,630
If I remember correctly,

284
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,830
this is a picture that Shinya took for me

285
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,730
when we came to reserve this wedding hall in June.

286
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,330
What does this mean?

287
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,530
Beats me.

288
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:14,630
If I lose that ring, how am I going to take responsibility for it?

289
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,530
I know I can't simply apologize.

290
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,130
Ms. Akane, what're you talking about?

291
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,630
It's just a ring after all.

292
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,630
Let's all look for it!

293
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,830
What? The ruby ring is lost?

294
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,830
Is that true?

295
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,230
Yes.

296
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,030
Call the wedding off!

297
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,630
We're calling off this wedding.

298
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,830
-What? -There will be no wedding until the ring is found.

299
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,830
We can't do that now.

300
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,130
Come now, mother dear.

301
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:14,730
Think about it, Masayo.

302
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,730
Ever since talk of this wedding came around,

303
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,130
bad things have been happening one after the other.

304
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:22,130
And that girl's to blame for everything.

305
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:26,530
To top things off, she loses the ring, which is a family treasure.

306
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,030
It's not Akane's fault!

307
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,630
What is Akane doing right now?

308
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,330
She says she wants to be alone and is in the waiting room.

309
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,830
I see. She must be in shock.

310
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,330
Everyone, it's almost time for the ceremony to begin.

311
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,230
Is something wrong?

312
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,630
The ruby ring is lost.

313
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:54,530
What? You mean that ring that the founder brought back from Europe?

314
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:58,330
It was definitely there until all of you came.

315
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,830
Hey, Shinya, just what are you trying to say?

316
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:06,230
Don't tell me that you're suspecting us?

317
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,230
When Sonoko and her friends came,

318
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,930
she says she was sure the ring was there.

319
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,430
This means it has to be the work of somebody

320
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,930
who came into the room later, isn't it?

321
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:19,830
It could be that glass craftsman from Hotaru called Takahashi.

322
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,630
This picture was left behind in place of the ring.

323
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,930
Since Shinya is the one who took this picture,

324
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,930
anybody from the Ohga family

325
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,130
could've got hold of it, isn't it?

326
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,430
You can't really tell.

327
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,630
Akane had the picture too, didn't she?

328
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,530
She could've stolen the ring and left the picture behind

329
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,130
to make it look as if someone from the Ohga family took it, right?

330
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,030
That's nonsense.

331
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,730
Well, no big deal.

332
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:52,730
It doesn't feel good being suspected anyway

333
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:56,430
so let's have them check every nook and cranny of our rooms right away.

334
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:59,430
However, so long as the whereabouts of the ring is unknown,

335
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:02,130
this marriage will be cancelled, understand?

336
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:21,690
The ring's nowhere in sight.

337
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:25,590
It's so small that it can be hidden anywhere, too.

338
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,390
Right, Ran?

339
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,690
What's the matter, Ran?

340
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,790
I'm worried, so I'm going to go see how Ms. Akane is.

341
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,790
Ran!

342
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,890
What are the bad things that happened

343
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,790
that grandma was talking about?

344
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,990
Oh, that.

345
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:43,690
Recently, there were two incidents

346
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,590
where we experienced close calls.

347
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:53,490
Madam, the brakes aren't working!

348
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,190
Madam!

349
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:11,490
The second time was on a clear, fine morning.

350
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,590
When I was taking a walk with grandma along Holland Slope near our house.

351
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,090
Look out!

352
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:24,290
Well, we were saved by a hairsbreadth,

353
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:27,590
but losing the ring is the third bad thing that happened,

354
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:30,090
so Grandma Tae is probably fed up.

355
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,290
Goodness.

356
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,490
Ms. Akane, this is Ran.

357
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,590
Ms. Akane.

358
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,390
It's strange.

359
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,590
I'm sure that someone who came into the waiting room took it.

360
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,290
Sonoko!

361
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,090
Ran.

362
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,690
Ms. Akane is not in the waiting room!

363
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,690
What?

364
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,490
The wedding dress was on the chair

365
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,490
and Ms. Akane was nowhere in sight.

366
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:19,090
Don't tell me that Ms. Akane put on an act just as Ms. Mika had said,

367
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,290
and actually stole the ring herself?

368
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,790
Akane's not that kind of person!

369
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,590
Let's go look for her.

370
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,390
But what about the ring?

371
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,590
Without it, there'll be no wedding.

372
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:37,790
I'm really bothered about the Hydrangea in the picture.

373
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,490
Hydrangeas signify "A change of heart".

374
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:44,290
I think we'll find the ring in a place where the Hydrangeas are.

375
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,790
Mr. Shinya, what's with the wedding?

376
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:52,390
Well, Ms. Akane disappeared.

377
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,790
What? The bride's gone?

378
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,090
Yes.

379
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,490
We were just thinking of splitting up and looking for her.

380
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,590
I'll help look for her, too.

381
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,690
Thank you.

382
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,190
I'll go look for the ring.

383
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:13,390
Hydrangeas. Where do I look for them?

384
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,890
Ms. Akane!

385
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,890
Ms. Akane!

386
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,190
Hydrangea... Change of heart...

387
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,790
Music box?

388
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,090
Change of heart...

389
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,590
Siebold...

390
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,390
Wait a second. I learned of it before.

391
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:36,390
Dr. Siebold is the one who took Japanese plants back to Europe.

392
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:40,890
And, one of the main ones was the Hydrangea.

393
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:49,790
The old scientific name for this flower is Hydrangea otakusa.

394
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:54,490
The name was taken from Siebold's Japanese wife's name, Otaki.

395
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,590
So, that's the story.

396
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,490
Hold on.

397
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,690
Could it be that Ms. Akane's picture was not about

398
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:03,890
what the flower signified, but...

399
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,690
Otakusa. "Otaki-san".

400
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,290
"Taki". (Taki means waterfall in Japanese)

401
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,790
Right!

402
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,290
I found it!

403
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,690
"Otaki-san". "Taki". (Taki means waterfall in Japanese)

404
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,690
My goodness.

405
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,090
I don't know who hid it, but...

406
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,190
I get it.

407
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:19,390
This fountain is Aphrodite and Psyche.

408
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,790
Ran!

409
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,990
Conan!

410
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,390
I found the ring!

411
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,190
Really?

412
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,990
Is something the matter?

413
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,690
Well...

414
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,690
This is...

415
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,890
Ms. Akane's high heel shoe!

416
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:40,890
It's not normal for her to go around with just one shoe.

417
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:43,790
I'm sure that she was kidnapped here.

418
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:46,390
We find the ring.

419
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,190
And now Ms. Akane's kidnapped?

420
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,580
Only one shoe was found by the windmill shed.

421
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,780
This is...

422
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,180
What's going on?

423
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,280
I'm just assuming from the circumstances,

424
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,680
but I think she was dragged away against her will.

425
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,080
No, do you mean she was abducted?

426
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,580
Don't be ridiculous!

427
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,680
I'm sure she couldn't take staying here and fled.

428
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,380
I checked at the departure gate of Huis Ten Bosch

429
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,980
and found that she hasn't gone outside yet.

430
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,680
It seems that Akane in the past

431
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,380
had a man that her parent's had decided she get married to.

432
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,680
I think that she is still seeing that man.

433
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:35,780
And maybe she had planned to embarrass Shinya, to begin with.

434
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:40,080
No way! I know her best!

435
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,280
Grandma's right.

436
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,380
Shinya, you've been completely deceived.

437
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,680
Like they say from long ago, "Love is blind".

438
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
No!

439
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,880
You're talking about the man that was Akane's father's apprentice.

440
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,080
That's an old story that goes back 10 years ago.

441
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,080
He left 10 years ago

442
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,480
and hasn't contacted her even once, since!

443
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,280
Well, without the bride,

444
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,180
we can't possibly have the wedding.

445
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,980
After the engagement and all,

446
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,380
if it turns out that the wedding is canceled,

447
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,380
it will be a blow

448
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,280
to the trust that people have in the Ohga Financial Group.

449
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,280
If the wedding is really going to be called off,

450
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,180
then Shinya's promotion to Vice-President of the bank

451
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:23,780
will probably have to be re-considered.

452
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,380
Dear.

453
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,980
She's slim and her hair is about this long.

454
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,680
I think she was wearing a pink one-piece dress.

455
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,080
I wonder if you mean her?

456
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,580
Have you seen her?

457
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,080
Yes, she went into the windmill shed alone.

458
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,780
About what time was it?

459
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:47,280
It was just about the time I came back from lunch break.

460
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,880
So, maybe around 1 pm.

461
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,780
About 1 pm.

462
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:55,380
If in one in a million chances, she was abducted as you say.

463
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,480
Are you saying that the one who took her away is here among us?

464
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,580
I can't say for sure,

465
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,380
but I think the probability is high.

466
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,180
How rude! Do you know what you're talking about?

467
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,780
Calm down, Mochida.

468
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,980
And just what are you planning to do gathering us together like this?

469
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:19,780
Ms. Akane was seen going into the windmill shed about 1 pm today

470
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,580
by a sales clerk at the cheese store.

471
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:26,280
So, I'd like to know where you were at around 1 pm.

472
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,280
Checking for the alibi.

473
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,380
I was here adjusting the books.

474
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,980
I was here with my wife all the while.

475
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:40,180
Around 1 pm, I was horseback riding in Friesian Horse Land.

476
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:44,980
Since the wedding was cancelled, I was drinking at the lounge here.

477
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,280
What about you, Mr. Takahashi?

478
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,080
1 pm?

479
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,880
I think that's just about the time I went to the Glass Museum again

480
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,880
to look at the antique glass.

481
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,880
Just as I thought.

482
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,480
-Can I borrow it? -Yes, sure.

483
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,080
If you want the pictures that are in it,

484
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,180
they'll print it out for you at the front desk.

485
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,080
Okay!

486
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,680
Thank you.

487
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,180
May I ask you something, Mr. Mochida?

488
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,180
What is it?

489
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,380
Is there something special about Ms. Akane's family?

490
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:19,080
Her father used to be a renowned glass craftsman in Nagasaki,

491
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,480
but passed away 10 years ago.

492
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,080
Anything else?

493
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,480
There are rumors that he committed suicide

494
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,580
because Ohga Bank pressured him

495
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,280
to return the money that we financed him.

496
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,480
Suicide?

497
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,880
The glass workshop that grandma owns in the city used to be his.

498
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,280
Grandma bought the workshop

499
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,380
that the bank forfeited as collateral.

500
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,780
She wanted the workshop,

501
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,080
so she pressured him to return the money

502
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,280
and got a hold of the workshop.

503
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,380
That is what some people say, but that's wrong.

504
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,280
All we did was carry out a legal transaction.

505
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,780
Well...

506
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,780
Yes. This person came.

507
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:03,880
He was drinking beer alone right through for about an hour.

508
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,080
Yes, I remember her.

509
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,080
She seemed to have really liked it and rode twice.

510
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,780
Oh, I see. Thank you so much.

511
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,380
This isn't the place. It's more to the back.

512
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,280
Here? The long hand fits.

513
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,780
So it's 3:05 pm now.

514
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,780
Wait a second.

515
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,180
Which means that this picture was taken not at 1 pm sharp,

516
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,680
but rather at 2:05 pm.

517
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,880
Since it's a faceless clock,

518
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,580
when the long hand and the shorthand overlaps,

519
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,180
it looks to be 1 pm sharp.

520
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,280
I thought something was wrong.

521
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,480
If the abductor abducted her at the windmill shed at 1 pm,

522
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,380
and is here at 2:05 pm.

523
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,980
Akane is probably confined somewhere

524
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:52,380
that's not too far away between the windmill shed and the flower clock.

525
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,680
I've got to find her quick.

526
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,980
You mentioned that you like high places, didn't you?

527
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,380
Right.

528
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,480
-You mean I get to ride that? -Yes.

529
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,480
Gosh. Where is she?

530
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,580
The melody sounds strange.

531
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,580
I get it! Some bells aren't ringing.

532
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,980
Could it be...

533
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,480
Aren't you riding?

534
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,880
No way. I hate high places

535
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,780
and just thinking about it sends chills up my spine.

536
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,780
So go ahead and enjoy yourself.

537
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,080
And you're still so young.

538
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,280
Ms. Akane!

539
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,080
Mr. Takahashi's going to kill Grandma Tae.

540
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,580
Hello.

541
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,780
Conan.

542
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,680
Where's granny? Where's Grandma Tae now?

543
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,780
Grandma is...

544
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,380
She went to ride the balloon with Mr. Takahashi.

545
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,280
Yes, the hot air balloon. Luftballoon.

546
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,080
I feel like a bird.

547
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,740
That's...

548
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,640
What's that?

549
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,140
A bomb?

550
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,640
There he is.

551
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,340
We're not going to make it.

552
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,240
What's that?

553
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,940
No! Don't touch it!

554
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,240
It's a triggering device that will set off the bomb set up on the balloon!

555
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,840
That's why don't touch it!

556
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,440
What?

557
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:59,740
I guess you two saved my life.

558
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,840
I'm so glad, grandma.

559
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,740
Akane, I'm so glad you're okay.

560
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,440
Shinya, I'm so sorry.

561
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,440
Mr. Takahashi...

562
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,040
Mr. Takahashi?

563
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,140
Akane, did you know him?

564
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,140
Yes.

565
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,740
What is the meaning of this?

566
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,840
What do you mean grandma was in danger?

567
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,140
Sonoko.

568
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,440
Sonoko!

569
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
I'll explain.

570
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,740
What?

571
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,240
Sonoko.

572
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,040
This entire case to begin with,

573
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,440
started with two people with different ideas acting at the same time.

574
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,440
Therefore, it looked as if one person was scheming everything.

575
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,740
Grandma Tae, one of them was you, wasn't it?

576
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,640
What?

577
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,540
Since you were against the marriage between Shinya and Akane.

578
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,540
-Grandmother! -My heart's just started throbbing a bit.

579
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,640
I'll get better after a little rest.

580
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,740
Isn't that right, Ms. Mika?

581
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,540
How could you do that?

582
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,140
Conan, please bring the thing.

583
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,440
Okay.

584
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,040
Ms. Akane, here you go.

585
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,540
You found the ring!

586
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,540
Thank you.

587
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,140
-Conan. -I wonder where it was found?

588
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,040
You know the fountain by Mauritz Square, don't you?

589
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,440
He seems to have found it there.

590
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,540
Leaving it too close to yourself

591
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:49,140
would increase the chances of us finding it when we go looking for it.

592
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:53,340
Since Grandma Tae said so, you hid it at the fountain.

593
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,140
Isn't that right, Ms. Mika?

594
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,740
Yes, that's right.

595
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:00,640
Then, what was the picture of the Hydrangea about?

596
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,040
I was deceived by that, too.

597
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,840
At first because the Hydrangea signifies a change of heart,

598
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,040
I thought it was criticizing Ms. Akane for her change of heart.

599
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,840
But there was another meaning to that picture.

600
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,440
Another meaning?

601
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,140
The water of that fountain flows like that of a waterfall, doesn't it?

602
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,240
Yes.

603
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,440
The scientific name that was given to the Hydrangea in the beginning

604
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,840
was Hydrangea otakusa,

605
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,840
a name that Siebold had given it.

606
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:29,440
He called it Otakusa after his wife's name Otaki.

607
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,140
Otakusa. "Otakisan". "Taki" (waterfall), right?

608
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,040
-That's what it was. -Yes.

609
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,040
Did you know about it?

610
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,240
Yes.

611
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,640
Although that picture looked to be criticizing Ms. Akane,

612
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,940
it was actually indicating where the ring was hidden.

613
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,640
Now you know.

614
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,140
The people who stole the ring are

615
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,440
grandma and Ms. Mika!

616
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:57,640
But, Ms. Akane being abducted was a mere coincidence.

617
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:01,040
She felt responsible for losing the ring

618
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,240
and gave up on marrying Shinya.

619
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,040
Then, on her own initiative, she decided to disappear.

620
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,640
What happened after that, Ms. Akane?

621
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,540
I went out from the waiting room to the back yard,

622
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,040
I coincidentally found Mr. Takahashi

623
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,040
and I secretly followed him.

624
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,640
Mr. Takahashi, what are you doing?

625
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,540
I'm going to give it to that old lady.

626
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,940
Have you forgotten?

627
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:46,240
Your father passed away all because of that old lady.

628
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,640
The one who stole the ring is that woman called Mika, you know.

629
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,640
No way.

630
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,240
Of course, the old lady told her to do so, though.

631
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,640
Please let me go through with what I've planned.

632
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,540
And, till Conan came to save me,

633
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:02,440
I was locked up in Carillon Symphonica.

634
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,340
Then he...

635
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,640
Yes, he's the one who had been chosen as Ms. Akane's groom in the past

636
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,340
that Grandma Teo was talking about.

637
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,640
What?

638
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,740
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about it.

639
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,840
When I saw Mr. Takahashi yesterday with Sonoko and the others,

640
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,840
I was really surprised

641
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,540
because it's been 10 years since I last saw him.

642
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:23,040
Ms. Akane, you saw Mr. Takahashi last night, didn't you?

643
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,440
Yes, I asked him why he came.

644
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:32,440
He answered that he came to watch my wedding from afar.

645
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,540
But, I was worried whether he was really telling me the truth

646
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,440
and if that was all there was to it.

647
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,740
Mr. Takahashi, isn't it about time you got up?

648
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,340
Just how long do you intend to stay sleeping there?

649
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,140
Since when did you realize what was going on?

650
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,740
I thought something was strange to begin with,

651
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,040
because although you said you were from Hotaru,

652
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,440
when you saw Ms. Akane in her wedding dress,

653
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,440
you spoke in the Nigasaki dialect and said she was beautiful.

654
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,840
You're the one who tampered with the brakes of grandma's car

655
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,940
as well as dropped the rock from above the stone wall, right?

656
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,440
Yes, that's right.

657
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,640
Ms. Akane's father was killed by this old lady!

658
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,640
Mister was suddenly pressured to return the money

659
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,940
that Ohga Bank had loaned him,

660
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,940
and committed suicide out of desperation.

661
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:21,940
I've never forgotten the miserable sight of her father, not even once.

662
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,240
Mister!

663
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,540
Mister, why'd you do this?

664
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,840
How could you leave Akane all alone?

665
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,640
This all happened just because

666
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,040
the old lady wanted a glass workshop for her pastime.

667
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,340
Just before all this happened,

668
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:42,240
we were gradually losing orders from our big dealers.

669
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,340
I went to ask a wholesaler in Hotaru where mister had transactions with,

670
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,240
if he knew what was going on.

671
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,340
He finally admitted that he was reducing order to us

672
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,240
because he was concerned about Ohga Bank.

673
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,840
Wrong!

674
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,440
Father.

675
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,440
My mother liked Mr. Katori's glassworks.

676
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,040
So, wanting him to somehow continue,

677
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,840
she even gave him advice on how to manage the workshop.

678
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
What?

679
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,240
However, Mr. Katori who was a craftsman through

680
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,140
and through refused to lend an ear.

681
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:15,540
He insisted saying, "My glasswork is only for those

682
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,240
who see the value in them".

683
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,540
He kept making fantastic glassworks spending time,

684
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,840
putting his all into them.

685
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,440
Of course his works were expensive

686
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,440
but they were indeed masterpieces.

687
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,540
However, they didn't make out

688
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,640
and he went more and more into the reds.

689
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,140
As a result...

690
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:35,240
As a result, he started delaying payments for the loan he had with us.

691
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,640
First, he delayed 3 days, a week,

692
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,540
then two weeks and so on forth.

693
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,740
We're not all that big a bank either,

694
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,740
so we couldn't afford this to go on forever.

695
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:44,840
That's a lie!

696
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,340
It's not a lie.

697
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,040
It's a lie.

698
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,540
It's not a lie, Mr. Takahashi.

699
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,140
It's a lie!

700
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:56,040
Mister isn't such a weak person.

701
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,640
He used to sweat from early morning to late at night

702
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,540
teaching me, who knew nothing, from A to Z.

703
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:07,440
Grandma, you were against Ms. Akane getting married

704
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,440
because you blamed yourself for not being thoughtful enough

705
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,640
and driving to Ms. Akane's father suicidal, right?

706
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,240
That's why it really hurt for you to look at Ms. Akane, right?

707
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,440
Grandma.

708
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,840
So, since Ms. Akane found out

709
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,640
that Mr. Takahashi was attempting to kill grandma,

710
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,440
she was locked up.

711
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,640
I know it's not something that can be forgiven.

712
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:35,140
But please forgive Mr. Takahashi.

713
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,340
Akane.

714
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,440
Grandma.

715
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,940
Please, I beg you.

716
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,440
-Grandma. -Chairwoman!

717
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,840
Mochida, about playing the role of the father of the bride,

718
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,140
although he's quite young yet,

719
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:49,440
why don't we have Mr. Takahashi do it?

720
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,440
Of course, I totally agree.

721
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,840
Grandma.

722
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,240
Then, you're approving of them getting married?

723
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,040
The ring was found, so most naturally.

724
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,840
Oh, I'm glad!

725
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,640
Grandma had intended things to turn out this way, to begin with.

726
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,640
What?

727
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,140
She was intending to approve of their marriage

728
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,040
when the ring was found.

729
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,740
How do you know?

730
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:17,140
The sculpture of that fountain is Aphrodite and Psyche.

731
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:22,340
Aphrodite jealous of Psyche who had fallen in love with her son, Eros,

732
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:25,240
gives Psyche many trials to accomplish.

733
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,540
However, she finally approves both to see through their love

734
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:31,440
after Psyche accomplishes everything that was dished out to her.

735
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,540
That fountain describes this final scene.

736
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,140
Grandma knew of this Greek mythology

737
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,940
and had the ring hidden there.

738
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,840
She even deliberately left the picture of the Hydrangeas behind as a hint,

739
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,240
pointing to "Taki", Siebold's wife,

740
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,440
isn't that right, grandma?

741
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,940
It' so full of western letters that I have no idea what it's about.

742
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,440
-Oh, my. -Just as expected of you, grandma.

743
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,040
When things get inconvenient for you, you try to brush it off.

744
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,540
I do.

745
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,740
Do you promise

746
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,540
to love him?

747
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,240
I do.

748
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,940
I'm supposed to get married to Mr. Kyogoku!

749
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,340
Sonoko.

750
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:32,040
Ran took it!

751
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,840
Not my fault.

752
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,840
Next Conan's Hint:

753
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,920
"Organizing Neatly"
