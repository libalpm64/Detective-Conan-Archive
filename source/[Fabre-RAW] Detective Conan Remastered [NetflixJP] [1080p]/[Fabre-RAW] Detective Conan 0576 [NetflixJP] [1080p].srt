1
00:00:01,925 --> 00:00:06,625
Pops and I accompany Ran and Sonoko shopping,

2
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:09,425
and end up finding the dead body of a woman

3
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:11,525
in the toilet compartment of a restroom in a park.

4
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:14,425
We witnessed the victim, Ms. Mihiro Kuze

5
00:00:14,425 --> 00:00:17,025
dressed in Goth Lolita fashion,

6
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:20,125
at a coffee shop in Shinjuku.

7
00:00:21,525 --> 00:00:24,025
Although Mihiro sits down once,

8
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:26,425
she gets up to go to the restroom outside the shop

9
00:00:26,425 --> 00:00:28,725
even before placing her order.

10
00:00:28,725 --> 00:00:32,425
Just then, Yuika, Mihiro's friend

11
00:00:32,425 --> 00:00:34,725
that she had been waiting for, shows up,

12
00:00:34,725 --> 00:00:38,325
but Mihiro never came back to her seat.

13
00:00:38,325 --> 00:00:41,525
Ms. Shodo is counted as one of the suspects,

14
00:00:41,525 --> 00:00:44,125
but she had a perfect alibi.

15
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,925
However...

16
00:00:51,425 --> 00:00:53,225
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

17
00:00:53,225 --> 00:00:55,225
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

18
00:00:55,225 --> 00:00:57,225
Murder case because of warped friendship.

19
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:59,625
Keep on the look-out for costume that Ran and Sonoko are wearing!

20
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,425
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:01,425 --> 00:01:03,425
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:03,425 --> 00:01:05,425
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

23
00:02:46,174 --> 00:02:51,874
"Alibi of the Black Dress (Part 2)"

24
00:02:53,074 --> 00:02:55,174
This lady that came first...

25
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:57,374
Did she order anything?

26
00:02:57,374 --> 00:02:58,974
No, nothing.

27
00:02:58,974 --> 00:03:00,874
She was looking through the menu

28
00:03:00,874 --> 00:03:03,974
before going to use the restroom though.

29
00:03:03,974 --> 00:03:07,674
Can I borrow this menu, then?

30
00:03:07,674 --> 00:03:09,874
-Yes, sir. -I don't think you'll find...

31
00:03:09,874 --> 00:03:12,274
-Mihiro's fingerprints on it. -Huh?

32
00:03:12,274 --> 00:03:13,874
"Yuka Shodo (26)" -I accidentally spilled water

33
00:03:13,874 --> 00:03:15,974
out of the glass cup on the table.

34
00:03:15,974 --> 00:03:18,074
When I tried to pick that cup up,

35
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:19,974
I carelessly placed the menu on top of the table

36
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:22,374
soaked with water and wet it,

37
00:03:22,374 --> 00:03:24,574
so I wiped it later.

38
00:03:24,574 --> 00:03:27,974
Of course, I wiped the table and the sofa

39
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,574
where the water splashed on to.

40
00:03:29,574 --> 00:03:34,374
No trace of Mihiro having come here would be left behind.

41
00:03:34,374 --> 00:03:38,774
Which means that I'm the killer?

42
00:03:38,774 --> 00:03:40,674
Inspector?

43
00:03:40,674 --> 00:03:42,374
No.

44
00:03:42,374 --> 00:03:44,274
But it's a problem.

45
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:46,474
The cup that Mihiro was holding

46
00:03:46,474 --> 00:03:47,574
dropped to the floor and cracked too.

47
00:03:47,574 --> 00:03:49,074
Cracked?

48
00:03:50,974 --> 00:03:55,674
If it cracked, isn't it still here, the cup?

49
00:03:55,674 --> 00:03:58,374
Yes! Inside the incombustibles trash bag.

50
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:03,074
Is this the debris?

51
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:04,174
Yes, sir.

52
00:04:04,174 --> 00:04:07,374
This is the only cup that cracked today.

53
00:04:07,374 --> 00:04:10,474
Let's call forensics and have them check it.

54
00:04:10,474 --> 00:04:13,674
If you like, would you like to go to the shop

55
00:04:13,674 --> 00:04:15,174
that Mihiro bought her clothes at too?

56
00:04:15,174 --> 00:04:18,174
I have an idea of what shop Mihiro would go to.

57
00:04:22,574 --> 00:04:24,774
Yes, it's her.

58
00:04:24,774 --> 00:04:27,174
She came yesterday at sundown to buy it.

59
00:04:27,174 --> 00:04:29,774
-Alone? -Yes, sir.

60
00:04:29,774 --> 00:04:32,874
Then, is she the only one who bought that outfit?

61
00:04:32,874 --> 00:04:36,274
No. This is an original of our shop

62
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:37,274
that we put on the shelves yesterday.

63
00:04:37,274 --> 00:04:38,474
It's really popular,

64
00:04:38,474 --> 00:04:41,274
so it sold out on the same day.

65
00:04:41,274 --> 00:04:45,474
Did you see her among the customers who came to buy the outfit?

66
00:04:45,474 --> 00:04:46,674
I wonder.

67
00:04:46,674 --> 00:04:49,874
-I couldn't have bought it, could I? -Huh?

68
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:51,474
I was on a business trip in Fukuoka last night,

69
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:53,174
and while riding a cab,

70
00:04:53,174 --> 00:04:56,374
I got a call from Mihiro saying that she bought the outfit!

71
00:04:57,174 --> 00:04:59,374
In Fukuoka...

72
00:04:59,374 --> 00:05:02,474
Yes! I arrived in Haneda Airport this afternoon,

73
00:05:02,474 --> 00:05:05,274
and went straight to that coffee shop in Shinjuku!

74
00:05:05,274 --> 00:05:06,774
Really?

75
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:08,874
You can go ahead and check on it if you want!

76
00:05:08,874 --> 00:05:12,374
I was on that plane together with a colleague of mine!

77
00:05:12,374 --> 00:05:14,174
If that's true,

78
00:05:14,174 --> 00:05:17,074
she didn't have a chance to buy that outfit.

79
00:05:17,074 --> 00:05:19,474
But she's probably the culprit.

80
00:05:19,474 --> 00:05:20,874
How on earth did she do it?

81
00:05:20,874 --> 00:05:23,574
Hey, Conan.

82
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,774
Come here.

83
00:05:25,774 --> 00:05:29,374
I borrowed the fitting room in this shop and changed.

84
00:05:29,374 --> 00:05:30,574
Hey, hey.

85
00:05:30,574 --> 00:05:34,274
Wearing Lolita clothes when there was a murder?

86
00:05:34,274 --> 00:05:36,174
How do you like it?

87
00:05:38,774 --> 00:05:41,574
Is it funny, after all?

88
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:45,274
It... It's not funny, but...

89
00:05:45,274 --> 00:05:48,074
Oh no! She looks cute!

90
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:53,574
God! It's no use showing this kid, it's a waste of time!

91
00:05:53,574 --> 00:05:57,574
How come you're both wearing the same outfit?

92
00:05:57,574 --> 00:06:00,874
You know nothing about things like this, do you?

93
00:06:00,874 --> 00:06:04,274
This is a type of fashion and...

94
00:06:07,374 --> 00:06:08,574
I see.

95
00:06:08,574 --> 00:06:12,074
Mihiro's fingerprints were found on the cracked piece of glass cup.

96
00:06:12,074 --> 00:06:15,574
Which means, she's got a perfect alibi.

97
00:06:15,574 --> 00:06:18,474
Then, will you please let me go already?

98
00:06:18,474 --> 00:06:20,674
It's getting pretty late, too.

99
00:06:23,974 --> 00:06:26,174
It's already pretty late.

100
00:06:26,174 --> 00:06:29,174
I see. That's how it is.

101
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:35,374
Huh? A strangely clean place?

102
00:06:35,374 --> 00:06:38,174
I don't think there was such a place

103
00:06:38,174 --> 00:06:40,874
inside the toilet where the body was found.

104
00:06:40,874 --> 00:06:42,874
Did you check the other toilet compartments too?

105
00:06:42,874 --> 00:06:45,174
No, not yet.

106
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,474
The toilet right next to it.

107
00:06:49,474 --> 00:06:51,474
Only the cover of the toilet paper holder in that compartment

108
00:06:51,474 --> 00:06:54,074
was strangely really clean.

109
00:06:54,074 --> 00:06:55,574
There!

110
00:06:57,774 --> 00:07:00,874
I'm leaving then!

111
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:04,874
I've got to inform my other friends about Mihiro's death too.

112
00:07:04,874 --> 00:07:07,174
No, I can't let you go just yet.

113
00:07:07,174 --> 00:07:09,374
Something keeps bothering me.

114
00:07:09,374 --> 00:07:11,074
I can't understand why Mihiro who was expecting

115
00:07:11,074 --> 00:07:13,974
to meet you at the coffee shop in Shinjuku,

116
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:15,674
left to go to the restroom

117
00:07:15,674 --> 00:07:18,374
and left the shop as well without waiting for you.

118
00:07:18,374 --> 00:07:21,174
Then, for some reason was found killed

119
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,774
in a restroom in a park in Harajuku.

120
00:07:23,774 --> 00:07:27,374
How should I know?

121
00:07:27,374 --> 00:07:29,674
All I can say is,

122
00:07:29,674 --> 00:07:32,174
about 10 minutes after Mihiro left to go to the restroom,

123
00:07:32,174 --> 00:07:34,674
I went into that coffee shop

124
00:07:34,674 --> 00:07:35,874
and kept calling Mihiro on her cell phone

125
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:38,674
because she didn't come back. I continued to call her,

126
00:07:38,674 --> 00:07:40,274
but she didn't answer her cell phone,

127
00:07:40,274 --> 00:07:42,774
and then when I finally got through...

128
00:07:42,774 --> 00:07:47,874
the person who answered was you, Inspector!

129
00:07:47,874 --> 00:07:52,274
Or what? Do you still suspect that I'm the culprit?

130
00:07:52,274 --> 00:07:55,074
No, it's not that.

131
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:58,974
Inspector, Ms. Shodo is clear!

132
00:07:58,974 --> 00:08:01,274
You mentioned a while ago, didn't you?

133
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:03,574
That if Ms. Shodo were the killer,

134
00:08:03,574 --> 00:08:05,974
after Mihiro left to go to the restroom,

135
00:08:05,974 --> 00:08:08,074
she would've had to call her and tell her to come to the park.

136
00:08:08,074 --> 00:08:09,474
Then, after killing her,

137
00:08:09,474 --> 00:08:12,374
Ms. Shodo would have to return to that coffee shop.

138
00:08:12,374 --> 00:08:15,374
It takes more than 30 minutes from that coffee shop

139
00:08:15,374 --> 00:08:18,274
in Shinjuku to the park in Harajuku round trip.

140
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:22,074
It's impossible for Ms. Shodo to come to the shop 10 minutes

141
00:08:22,074 --> 00:08:23,974
after Mihiro left the shop.

142
00:08:23,974 --> 00:08:28,074
Mihiro's fingerprints were detected on the glass cup, weren't they?

143
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:33,474
If so, that is clear fact that Mihiro came to the shop!

144
00:08:33,474 --> 00:08:37,674
But I wonder why Mihiro touched that cup?

145
00:08:37,674 --> 00:08:40,674
Huh? If they serve you water at a coffee shop,

146
00:08:40,674 --> 00:08:42,574
you'd most naturally drink it, wouldn't you?

147
00:08:42,574 --> 00:08:47,074
But that cup that this lady dropped

148
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:50,274
had no lipstick on it anywhere.

149
00:08:53,674 --> 00:08:56,574
Remember? The lady dressed in Goth Lolita fashion

150
00:08:56,574 --> 00:08:59,974
was wearing pitch black lipstick, right?

151
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:02,574
That's true.

152
00:09:02,574 --> 00:09:05,574
I don't think you know, sonny

153
00:09:05,574 --> 00:09:08,174
but it's manners for a lady to inconspicuously

154
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:12,474
wipe off from the cup any lipstick that is on the cup with her fingers.

155
00:09:12,474 --> 00:09:14,674
But I don't think there was any trace of lipstick

156
00:09:14,674 --> 00:09:17,074
being wiped off with her fingers either.

157
00:09:17,074 --> 00:09:22,574
Then, when Mihiro hit the cup as she opened the menu,

158
00:09:22,574 --> 00:09:25,574
maybe she just moved it to the side?

159
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:27,474
It could be that she didn't drink out of the cup at all,

160
00:09:27,474 --> 00:09:29,674
but rather got up right away to the restroom.

161
00:09:29,674 --> 00:09:32,674
Even when I returned the menu,

162
00:09:32,674 --> 00:09:36,974
I hit the cup, dropped and cracked it.

163
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:41,274
But you were lucky that the cup cracked.

164
00:09:41,274 --> 00:09:44,074
Lucky?

165
00:09:44,074 --> 00:09:47,074
Because if it didn't crack,

166
00:09:47,074 --> 00:09:49,374
you would've been asked by the Inspector

167
00:09:49,374 --> 00:09:51,474
to come to the scene of the crime.

168
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:53,874
And if after you left the coffee shop,

169
00:09:53,874 --> 00:09:56,474
the employee cleared the cup away, and washed it,

170
00:09:56,474 --> 00:10:00,274
don't you think the fingerprints would've come off?

171
00:10:00,274 --> 00:10:03,974
And, why did you sit on the same side

172
00:10:03,974 --> 00:10:07,674
where the Goth Lolita woman was sitting?

173
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:09,874
Usually, when you wait for somebody and meet them,

174
00:10:09,874 --> 00:10:12,874
you sit in the seat opposite them, don't you?

175
00:10:12,874 --> 00:10:15,274
That's...

176
00:10:15,274 --> 00:10:17,074
If you didn't sit on that side,

177
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,274
you wouldn't have cracked the cup either.

178
00:10:19,274 --> 00:10:22,774
You idiot! Who cares where you sit!

179
00:10:22,774 --> 00:10:25,674
Besides, the cracked cup may not have been washed,

180
00:10:25,674 --> 00:10:27,574
but it's for sure it would've been thrown away!

181
00:10:27,574 --> 00:10:29,574
And if it's collected by the dump truck

182
00:10:29,574 --> 00:10:31,474
and taken to Yumenoshima or something, that's it.

183
00:10:31,474 --> 00:10:33,374
Just how many officers do you think is needed...

184
00:10:33,374 --> 00:10:36,374
-to look for it from within the heap of trash! -Troublesome.

185
00:10:43,174 --> 00:10:44,674
Hey, Mouri!

186
00:10:44,674 --> 00:10:46,074
Don't tell me it's come again.

187
00:10:46,074 --> 00:10:49,374
Mouri... The Sleeping Kogoro?

188
00:10:49,374 --> 00:10:51,374
Indeed.

189
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:55,174
I won't let this case go to sleep, though.

190
00:10:55,174 --> 00:10:59,074
I'll explain it so it makes sense.

191
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:00,674
After strangling Ms. Mihiro Kuze to death

192
00:11:00,674 --> 00:11:02,874
in the restroom in the park at Harajuku,

193
00:11:02,874 --> 00:11:05,974
you went right away to the coffee shop in Shinjuku

194
00:11:05,974 --> 00:11:09,374
to establish an alibi for yourself.

195
00:11:09,374 --> 00:11:12,774
Isn't that right, Ms. Yuika Shodo?

196
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:24,825
Hey, hey, wait a minute there, Mr. Mouri.

197
00:11:24,825 --> 00:11:27,025
You also said that

198
00:11:27,025 --> 00:11:29,525
it'll take at least 30 minutes round trip

199
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:31,525
to get from the park restroom to the coffee shop,

200
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,425
so how could Ms. Shodo who came to the shop

201
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:36,725
10 minutes after Mihiro went out to use the restroom, have done it?

202
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:40,125
It's true that if Mihiro was killed after she stood up

203
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,525
to go to the restroom, it'd be impossible.

204
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:48,125
But if Mihiro was killed before she came to the shop then...

205
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,025
it's possible!

206
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:52,825
Before she came to the coffee shop...

207
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:55,325
Which means that the one who came to the shop...

208
00:11:55,325 --> 00:11:59,225
Yes. I think that maybe you felt the same too

209
00:11:59,225 --> 00:12:01,525
when you saw Mihiro's body.

210
00:12:01,525 --> 00:12:04,625
I'm sure you though Goth Lolita fashion is flashy and very strong.

211
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,325
The employee at the coffee shop

212
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,825
along with us, who were there as customers of the shop,

213
00:12:08,825 --> 00:12:12,025
were taken aback by the strong impact of her appearance.

214
00:12:12,025 --> 00:12:14,325
So, we don't really remember what she actually looked like

215
00:12:14,325 --> 00:12:17,125
and can't acknowledge her!

216
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:20,525
No one would ever imagine that the office lady type woman

217
00:12:20,525 --> 00:12:23,925
that came into the shop 10 minutes later

218
00:12:23,925 --> 00:12:25,725
was in fact the same person

219
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:27,925
as the one who came in wearing the Goth Lolita outfit!

220
00:12:27,925 --> 00:12:31,825
Huh? What on earth are you talking about?

221
00:12:31,825 --> 00:12:33,525
You said that Mihiro's fingerprints

222
00:12:33,525 --> 00:12:36,125
were found on the glass cup of the coffee shop!

223
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,025
It's no surprise!

224
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:40,625
Because that cup

225
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,925
is one that you stole from the coffee shop beforehand!

226
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:46,825
Right.

227
00:12:46,825 --> 00:12:51,325
You probably invited Mihiro over to your house,

228
00:12:51,325 --> 00:12:54,725
poured a drink into that cup and served it to her.

229
00:12:54,725 --> 00:12:58,025
You did so to get her fingerprints on the cup!

230
00:12:58,025 --> 00:13:01,625
You hid the cup that was placed before you

231
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,725
when you first came into the shop wearing the Goth Lolita

232
00:13:03,725 --> 00:13:05,925
into your bag,

233
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:10,525
and switched it with the cup with Mihiro's fingerprints on it.

234
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:13,825
10 minutes after that, you changed your make-up and clothes

235
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:15,125
and came to the shop.

236
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,925
You deliberately sat in the same seat you sat in

237
00:13:16,925 --> 00:13:19,225
when you first came to the shop

238
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:23,325
so that you could deliberately drop the cup that you had switched.

239
00:13:23,325 --> 00:13:25,225
You wanted to splash the water onto the floor

240
00:13:25,225 --> 00:13:26,525
and crack the cup.

241
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:32,625
By wiping the place where you were seated 10 minutes ago,

242
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,125
you wanted to create a situation,

243
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,625
in which things wouldn't look strange

244
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,625
even if traces of Mihiro couldn't be found where she was sitting.

245
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,025
In order to use the cup

246
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:43,125
as the only evidence showing that Mihiro came.

247
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,525
You wanted to crack it

248
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:46,925
because then the cracked pieces would have to be picked up,

249
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:48,225
and your fingerprints would also be detected

250
00:13:48,225 --> 00:13:49,325
on the glass cup you switched,

251
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:51,625
so you could deceive everyone.

252
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,225
But you said a while ago that

253
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:55,325
if it cracked, it would be thrown away.

254
00:13:55,325 --> 00:14:01,125
That is, if Mihiro's body was found 2-3 days later!

255
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,625
I see!

256
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:06,225
That's why you kept on calling Mihiro repeatedly!

257
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:07,525
If the phone keeps ringing

258
00:14:07,525 --> 00:14:09,825
and no one answers or comes out of the toilet,

259
00:14:09,825 --> 00:14:12,725
somebody is bound to check inside sooner or later!

260
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:17,425
The more so, if it's just the time the toilet gets crowded!

261
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:19,125
If Mihiro is found,

262
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:23,925
the police would suspect you, who kept calling her,

263
00:14:23,925 --> 00:14:27,025
and go over to the coffee shop where you promised to meet her,

264
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:31,225
and you would be able to show the cracked glass cup to the police

265
00:14:31,225 --> 00:14:33,825
before it's disposed of as incombustible trash!

266
00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:35,525
Hold it!

267
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:39,725
Have you all forgotten that Mihiro came last night

268
00:14:39,725 --> 00:14:43,125
to buy the Goth Lolita clothes she was wearing, alone?

269
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:46,625
Moreover, it was sold yesterday and only for one day!

270
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,025
Since I came back from my business trip

271
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:50,825
in Fukuoka this afternoon,

272
00:14:50,825 --> 00:14:52,325
I couldn't have bought it!

273
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:55,425
The point is not who bought it.

274
00:14:55,425 --> 00:14:58,225
But, rather, how many outfits were bought.

275
00:14:59,825 --> 00:15:04,425
Excuse me. Did Mihiro buy just one outfit like that?

276
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:06,525
No, she bought two.

277
00:15:06,525 --> 00:15:09,025
She said that she could only come at sundown

278
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:13,425
so to reserve and keep two outfits for her.

279
00:15:13,425 --> 00:15:15,525
It was a popular outfit

280
00:15:15,525 --> 00:15:17,725
that we put an advance advertisement out for,

281
00:15:17,725 --> 00:15:19,825
so she wanted us to keep it for her before it sold out.

282
00:15:19,825 --> 00:15:23,025
After the police came to confirm with the salesclerk

283
00:15:23,025 --> 00:15:25,925
whether Mihiro came alone to buy the outfit,

284
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,725
you...

285
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:30,725
Then, was she the only one who bought that outfit?

286
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,525
You interrupted the conversation, didn't you?

287
00:15:34,525 --> 00:15:36,425
You did so to stop the salesclerk

288
00:15:36,425 --> 00:15:42,725
from mentioning that Mihiro bought two outfits, didn't you?

289
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:45,125
You wanted people to place attention on who bought the outfit,

290
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:49,325
rather than how many outfits were bought.

291
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:50,825
Am I wrong?

292
00:15:52,425 --> 00:15:54,425
But, Mr. Mouri...

293
00:15:54,425 --> 00:15:57,925
I understand that Yuika and Mihiro were the same size

294
00:15:57,925 --> 00:16:00,125
and that Yuika made Mihiro bring her

295
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:04,125
the outfit she bought yesterday, over to her today.

296
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:07,125
But if Yuika had to completely copy the clothes,

297
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,825
make-up and hairstyle of Mihiro after killing her,

298
00:16:09,825 --> 00:16:11,825
wouldn't it take up a lot of time,

299
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:15,325
that she would practically have no time to establish an alibi?

300
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:18,825
It can't be that they both promised each other

301
00:16:18,825 --> 00:16:21,125
to wear the same outfit before the killing either, could it?

302
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,325
-Oh, as to that... -Exactly!

303
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:25,825
Besides, maybe she bought the two outfits

304
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:28,525
for herself and not for me.

305
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:30,125
Because she really liked it, and was keeping one more

306
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,325
so she could wear the other one if one of them get dirty!

307
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,625
Right? There are people like that, aren't there?

308
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,125
Well, yes.

309
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,225
As to that mystery,

310
00:16:39,225 --> 00:16:43,525
my daughter and her friend will resolve it.

311
00:16:43,525 --> 00:16:45,825
Ran and Sonoko!

312
00:16:45,825 --> 00:16:47,725
What're you hiding for?

313
00:16:47,725 --> 00:16:48,825
Hey.

314
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:50,625
That idiot!

315
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,425
Pops says to come out quickly

316
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:55,125
and show us your cute outfit!

317
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:58,025
-What? -Oh, goodness.

318
00:17:00,225 --> 00:17:01,625
Ta-da!

319
00:17:03,925 --> 00:17:06,525
What's with that look?

320
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,425
Moreover, it's the same clothes!

321
00:17:08,425 --> 00:17:11,225
That's called the twin fashion.

322
00:17:11,225 --> 00:17:13,125
Twin fashion?

323
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:16,325
It's a fashion referring to good friends wearing matching clothes,

324
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:17,825
the same hairstyles, make-up

325
00:17:17,825 --> 00:17:19,825
and even carrying the same kind of bag,

326
00:17:19,825 --> 00:17:23,025
so they virtually look like twins!

327
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:25,025
I thought that the person called Mihiro

328
00:17:25,025 --> 00:17:29,225
was going to enjoy twin fashion with a friend of hers.

329
00:17:29,225 --> 00:17:30,625
I see.

330
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:34,025
You told Mihiro that you'd like to wear twin fashion,

331
00:17:34,025 --> 00:17:37,625
and right after changing clothes in that park restroom,

332
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:41,525
you strangled her to death!

333
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:43,825
Well, I wonder about that?

334
00:17:43,825 --> 00:17:46,625
If you want to substantiate that, show me, will you?

335
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:50,725
-Proof that I did it. -There is proof...

336
00:17:50,725 --> 00:17:53,925
on your left arm.

337
00:17:53,925 --> 00:17:57,425
When you looked at your wristwatch a while ago...

338
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,225
It's getting late...

339
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:02,725
You stopped part way

340
00:18:02,725 --> 00:18:06,325
and looked at your cell phone watch, didn't you?

341
00:18:06,325 --> 00:18:10,325
You probably hesitated because when you strangled Mihiro,

342
00:18:10,325 --> 00:18:14,125
she scratched your left arm and the mark was there.

343
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,225
You've got a scratch.

344
00:18:18,225 --> 00:18:20,625
No! I did this myself when I was half sleeping!

345
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,825
Yes, you have all the reasons in the world

346
00:18:22,825 --> 00:18:25,025
to justify that scratch of yours.

347
00:18:25,025 --> 00:18:30,025
Besides no skin traces were found on Mihiro's fingertips,

348
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:34,025
so she must've scratched you with her fake nails.

349
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:36,625
It would be impossible to prove that you did it

350
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,325
as long as the fake nails are disposed of.

351
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:41,725
That's why despite the fact that

352
00:18:41,725 --> 00:18:46,325
you had to get away from the scene of the crime as soon as possible.

353
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:49,025
All the fake nails on both her hands

354
00:18:49,025 --> 00:18:52,225
were completely removed using a nail remover.

355
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:55,625
Why...

356
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:59,325
You wanted to hide the fact that you were scratched,

357
00:18:59,325 --> 00:19:03,825
along with the fact that the blood that dripped from the scratch

358
00:19:03,825 --> 00:19:08,525
fell onto a certain place in the toilet!

359
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:10,925
And just where is that certain place?

360
00:19:10,925 --> 00:19:13,925
Officer Takagi should be calling soon about that.

361
00:19:17,525 --> 00:19:19,225
Yes, Megure here.

362
00:19:21,325 --> 00:19:23,725
What? Blood reaction was found

363
00:19:23,725 --> 00:19:25,725
in the compartment next to the murder site?

364
00:19:25,725 --> 00:19:29,925
Only the toilet paper cover here had no dust on it,

365
00:19:29,925 --> 00:19:32,425
so I had forensics check it,

366
00:19:32,425 --> 00:19:34,025
and luminol reaction was detected!

367
00:19:34,025 --> 00:19:37,125
And? What about the result of the blood test?

368
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:40,225
It wasn't the victim's blood,

369
00:19:40,225 --> 00:19:42,525
so it's probably the culprit's.

370
00:19:42,525 --> 00:19:45,125
Most probably this is the compartment

371
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,525
where the actual murder took place,

372
00:19:46,525 --> 00:19:49,225
but since her blood dripped,

373
00:19:49,225 --> 00:19:53,125
I think she moved the body to the next compartment.

374
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,325
That seems to be the story!

375
00:19:55,325 --> 00:19:59,225
I would like to take your blood and have it checked.

376
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:03,025
Take it if you want.

377
00:20:03,025 --> 00:20:07,325
As for me, Mihiro took all and everything from me

378
00:20:07,325 --> 00:20:09,625
and I don't even have blood left for my nose to bleed.

379
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,125
Take everything?

380
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,525
You mean like your boyfriend?

381
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:15,325
Yes, he's one of them, too.

382
00:20:15,325 --> 00:20:18,725
The first time it happened was when I was 20, I think?

383
00:20:18,725 --> 00:20:20,225
I was down and out,

384
00:20:20,225 --> 00:20:23,025
but to make things worse, I was fired from my company

385
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:24,925
and evicted from my apartment.

386
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:28,625
In the end, for some reason, my friends all pulled away from me.

387
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,425
Eventually, the only one left was

388
00:20:30,425 --> 00:20:33,425
my childhood friend, Mihiro.

389
00:20:33,425 --> 00:20:38,225
She got me a job at her parent's company.

390
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:39,425
And I also started to live in her condo

391
00:20:39,425 --> 00:20:42,125
after she introduced me there.

392
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,025
Rather than take things from you,

393
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:47,225
she seems to have looked after you!

394
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:51,725
Yes. I used to think so until just recently, too.

395
00:20:51,725 --> 00:20:53,325
Until I found out that I got fired,

396
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:57,325
was evicted from my place and lost my friends...

397
00:20:57,325 --> 00:21:01,625
All because of the things that Mihiro did behind my back!

398
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:02,625
What?

399
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,125
Why would she do something like that?

400
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,225
I wonder.

401
00:21:05,225 --> 00:21:09,125
I think she just wanted to make sure our bond wouldn't break?

402
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:13,625
Because I was the only best friend she had.

403
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:18,525
But I was betrayed.

404
00:21:18,525 --> 00:21:20,925
And I believed her.

405
00:21:20,925 --> 00:21:25,525
That's why I took from her this time.

406
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,925
You two who are living in a fairy tale world

407
00:22:58,925 --> 00:23:01,225
better be careful, too.

408
00:23:01,225 --> 00:23:05,125
There's nothing more uncertain and fragile as friendship.

409
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:07,425
Well, let's hear the rest of story out at the station.

410
00:23:07,425 --> 00:23:10,425
Are you nuts?

411
00:23:10,425 --> 00:23:12,925
That's why it's good, because it's uncertain and fragile!

412
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:15,125
That's why when your heart and heart connects,

413
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:16,925
you feel warm inside!

414
00:23:16,925 --> 00:23:18,825
If it were super hard like a steel plate

415
00:23:18,825 --> 00:23:21,025
working out the way you want it to,

416
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,725
you could never feel the warmth!

417
00:23:26,325 --> 00:23:28,225
Right.

418
00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:32,625
If I could just have talked to her like you do,

419
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:35,825
maybe we could've have had

420
00:23:35,825 --> 00:23:38,525
a warm relationship like old times too.

421
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,325
Awesome, Sonoko!

422
00:23:48,325 --> 00:23:50,125
Yeah!

423
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,325
I mean... but saying something like that,

424
00:23:51,325 --> 00:23:52,925
dressed the way you are, I don't know.

425
00:23:56,825 --> 00:23:59,725
Where is everybody?
