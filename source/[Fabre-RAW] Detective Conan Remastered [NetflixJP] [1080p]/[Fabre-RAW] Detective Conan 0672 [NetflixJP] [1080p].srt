1
00:00:02,437 --> 00:00:05,437
A request that seemed at first glance to be a simple one,

2
00:00:05,437 --> 00:00:08,637
came in on the newly opened website.

3
00:00:08,637 --> 00:00:09,989
However, Pops receives mail from the client asking

4
00:00:10,237 --> 00:00:12,737
to change the meeting place,

5
00:00:12,737 --> 00:00:18,937
so Pops takes me, Ran and his disciple, Amuro, over to the place,

6
00:00:18,937 --> 00:00:22,001
but the client doesn't show up.

7
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,003
Therefore, we all returned to the agency after that.

8
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:26,005
Then, the client contacts Pops again,

9
00:00:26,237 --> 00:00:29,337
and we were just about to leave the agency a second time.

10
00:00:30,337 --> 00:00:33,037
Everyone, please be quiet.

11
00:00:33,037 --> 00:00:35,537
This is probably what this is all about.

12
00:00:35,537 --> 00:00:39,437
There is a person who doesn't want the client to meet with Mr. Mouri.

13
00:00:39,437 --> 00:00:40,937
So that person sends Mr. Mouri a fake mail

14
00:00:40,937 --> 00:00:44,023
asking to change the place of meeting to get him out of the agency.

15
00:00:44,237 --> 00:00:46,737
Then, that person acts as if he is an employee of the agency

16
00:00:46,737 --> 00:00:49,137
and meets with the client.

17
00:00:49,137 --> 00:00:51,237
But why would that person do something like that?

18
00:00:51,237 --> 00:00:54,637
All the client wanted was for Dad to look for the coin locker, right?

19
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,637
Maybe something unthinkable is in that locker?

20
00:00:57,637 --> 00:00:58,637
I wonder about that.

21
00:00:58,637 --> 00:01:00,337
Why don't we...

22
00:01:01,737 --> 00:01:04,637
ask the person himself?

23
00:01:04,637 --> 00:01:05,837
The person himself?

24
00:01:05,837 --> 00:01:07,237
Don't tell me that...

25
00:01:07,237 --> 00:01:09,637
You got a reply mail just as you were about

26
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:11,837
to go to the restroom, didn't you, Sensei?

27
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:15,037
And, just when Conan was about to go to the restroom too.

28
00:01:15,037 --> 00:01:18,057
Moreover, on the floor of the restroom

29
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:21,137
there was a trace of something having been dragged along.

30
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:24,063
Right.

31
00:01:24,237 --> 00:01:26,937
Most probably that someone for some reason,

32
00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:30,937
has the client with him and is still here

33
00:01:30,937 --> 00:01:33,437
hiding inside the restroom.

34
00:01:36,737 --> 00:01:38,337
Don't tell me...

35
00:01:41,837 --> 00:01:43,237
What?

36
00:01:47,837 --> 00:01:52,091
The woman that was confined in the restroom was Ms. Kei Kashizuka.

37
00:01:52,337 --> 00:01:56,095
She claims that she has never seen the man that was found dead beside her.

38
00:01:56,337 --> 00:01:57,737
The belongings of the man was his cell phone

39
00:01:57,737 --> 00:01:59,137
which had no other data in it

40
00:01:59,137 --> 00:02:02,101
except for the mail that had been sent to Pops.

41
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:03,737
5,000 yen worth of loose change,

42
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:06,537
and a wallet with quite a number of bills in it.

43
00:02:06,537 --> 00:02:08,637
Ms. Kashizuka went through a brief questioning,

44
00:02:08,637 --> 00:02:10,437
after which she was allowed to go home.

45
00:02:10,437 --> 00:02:13,337
Amuro gives Ms. Kashizuka who finishes interrogation a lift home.

46
00:02:15,237 --> 00:02:18,737
Ms. Kashizuka, is this the road?

47
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:19,737
Yes.

48
00:02:19,737 --> 00:02:22,837
By the way, why are you guys riding together?

49
00:02:22,837 --> 00:02:24,537
It's cramped in here.

50
00:02:24,537 --> 00:02:25,637
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:25,637 --> 00:02:29,037
This car isn't made to seat 3 people in the backseat, you see.

52
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:31,337
It's okay.

53
00:02:31,337 --> 00:02:34,133
Why are you riding with us, Dad?

54
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:37,537
I was worried about Ms. Kei, that's why.

55
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:41,637
That man. I wonder if he really committed suicide.

56
00:02:41,637 --> 00:02:44,937
But, there seems to have been no gun discharge residue

57
00:02:44,937 --> 00:02:49,937
detected from Ms. Kashizuka's body

58
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:53,037
and what's even stranger is his cell phone.

59
00:02:53,037 --> 00:02:54,153
Why was everything, except the mail

60
00:02:54,153 --> 00:02:56,155
that was sent to Pops the received/sent history,

61
00:02:56,155 --> 00:02:59,237
including the address book all blank?

62
00:02:59,237 --> 00:03:01,337
Besides, the things that were left back in his pocket,

63
00:03:01,337 --> 00:03:04,163
the loose change and bills, that were in his wallet.

64
00:03:04,337 --> 00:03:09,537
Why did he have to carry around so many bills and change?

65
00:03:09,537 --> 00:03:11,237
One more thing.

66
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:15,337
She's hiding something.

67
00:03:17,237 --> 00:03:19,137
The vivid colored memories of summer

68
00:03:19,137 --> 00:03:21,037
solve mysteries all season round.

69
00:03:21,037 --> 00:03:22,837
The high-class condo of the client.

70
00:03:22,837 --> 00:03:25,137
Something is strange and something smells.

71
00:03:25,137 --> 00:03:26,737
He sees through the one and only truth.

72
00:03:26,737 --> 00:03:28,837
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

73
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:31,237
His name is Detective Conan.

74
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:18,013
"Nocturne of the Detectives (Kidnap)"

75
00:05:25,613 --> 00:05:27,813
This is a nice condo.

76
00:05:27,813 --> 00:05:29,713
I'll bet the rent is quite expensive, no?

77
00:05:29,713 --> 00:05:31,613
Yes, sort of.

78
00:05:31,613 --> 00:05:33,113
But I depended on my parents to help me out

79
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:35,713
and was living here with my older brother so...

80
00:05:35,713 --> 00:05:38,913
About here would be fine, you know.

81
00:05:38,913 --> 00:05:41,613
I've already found that no one is ambushing me so...

82
00:05:41,613 --> 00:05:43,513
I guess so.

83
00:05:43,513 --> 00:05:45,413
Okay, I guess we'll get going then.

84
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:48,327
I forgot that I had to use the restroom!

85
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:50,329
What shall I do? I'm going to pee in my pants.

86
00:05:50,513 --> 00:05:53,413
Please, miss! The restroom, please let me use the restroom!

87
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:56,913
Please, I can't hold it any longer!

88
00:05:56,913 --> 00:06:00,113
Okay. Hold on one second.

89
00:06:03,213 --> 00:06:05,713
This smell. Don't tell me that...

90
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:08,613
The restroom is on the right after you go in the front door.

91
00:06:08,613 --> 00:06:10,349
Yes, thank you.

92
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:15,213
Excuse me. Actually, I've been holding back too.

93
00:06:15,213 --> 00:06:17,413
Me too.

94
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:22,813
Good grief. Would you like to all drop by for a while, then?

95
00:06:22,813 --> 00:06:24,713
All I've got to serve you is tea, though.

96
00:06:24,713 --> 00:06:26,365
I'm sorry, Ms. Kei.

97
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:28,367
Don't be, it can't be helped.

98
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:31,613
Like they say, necessity has no law.

99
00:06:31,613 --> 00:06:33,413
Dad!

100
00:06:43,013 --> 00:06:46,385
Oh my, my there're sure a lot of dishes out here.

101
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:48,913
Did you have a party or something last night?

102
00:06:48,913 --> 00:06:52,391
Yes, several of my college friends got together here.

103
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:54,913
I'm sorry it's messy.

104
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:57,013
No, no problem.

105
00:06:57,013 --> 00:06:58,113
Let see.

106
00:06:58,113 --> 00:07:02,401
Kei, can I help you?

107
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:05,113
Could you clear the table off for me, then?

108
00:07:05,113 --> 00:07:06,405
All right.

109
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:08,113
Today at around 16:00,

110
00:07:08,113 --> 00:07:12,113
in the restroom of the Mouri Detective agency located on 5-Beika St.,

111
00:07:12,113 --> 00:07:14,413
a shocking case of a man committing suicide

112
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:16,415
shooting himself to death, occurred.

113
00:07:16,613 --> 00:07:18,813
No joke! It's already being aired on the news.

114
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:19,913
Looks to be so.

115
00:07:19,913 --> 00:07:23,313
-The identity of the man is still unknown. -No! I'll bet Mom's worried.

116
00:07:23,313 --> 00:07:26,213
After all, I had my cell phone switched off.

117
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,013
Hello?

118
00:07:29,013 --> 00:07:30,913
Why did you have the phone switched off?

119
00:07:30,913 --> 00:07:32,431
You worried the wits out of me!

120
00:07:32,613 --> 00:07:33,613
Masumi?

121
00:07:33,613 --> 00:07:36,713
I'm sorry, so sorry, we were busy here investigating on a case here.

122
00:07:36,713 --> 00:07:40,439
And, are Conan... Kogo... okay?

123
00:07:40,613 --> 00:07:42,813
I'm sorry. Your voice is choppy,

124
00:07:42,813 --> 00:07:45,113
and it's hard to make out what you're saying.

125
00:07:46,213 --> 00:07:50,449
Hello, Masumi? Can you hear me all right on your side?

126
00:07:52,713 --> 00:07:54,713
-Ms. Kei! -Yes?

127
00:07:54,713 --> 00:07:58,813
Maybe this room is being wiretapped.

128
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:03,013
But, how do you know?

129
00:08:03,013 --> 00:08:06,113
Because of Ran's cell phone a while ago, right?

130
00:08:06,113 --> 00:08:08,213
If a wiretap is set up,

131
00:08:08,213 --> 00:08:11,313
there are times that cell phones have bad connection.

132
00:08:11,313 --> 00:08:13,113
Just as would be expected of you, Mouri Sensei.

133
00:08:13,113 --> 00:08:15,913
Ms. Kei, I will go through each of the rooms now

134
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:18,477
and check where the wiretaps are set up,

135
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:19,913
so I hope you don't mind?

136
00:08:19,913 --> 00:08:20,913
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:20,913 --> 00:08:22,813
Could wait just 5 minutes.

138
00:08:22,813 --> 00:08:25,513
They are all messed up.

139
00:08:25,513 --> 00:08:28,013
I'd like to put away my underwear so...

140
00:08:40,713 --> 00:08:42,913
Where are you going?

141
00:08:43,913 --> 00:08:46,013
Miss.

142
00:08:46,013 --> 00:08:47,813
I ran out of tea leaves,

143
00:08:47,813 --> 00:08:49,213
so I'm going to the convenience store to buy some.

144
00:08:49,213 --> 00:08:51,913
I'll go with you, then.

145
00:08:51,913 --> 00:08:54,113
I want something too.

146
00:08:54,113 --> 00:08:56,113
Would you like me to go get Ran, too?

147
00:08:56,113 --> 00:08:58,013
No need! Let's go, just the two of us.

148
00:08:58,013 --> 00:08:59,213
Yep.

149
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:07,513
10 minutes have passed already, but Ms. Kei hasn't come back yet.

150
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,113
I wonder if she went to the restroom?

151
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:13,513
Okay then, why don't we start looking for the wiretaps ourselves?

152
00:09:13,513 --> 00:09:17,513
Ran, please stand in the middle of the room

153
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:22,541
that I'm searching and play the music in your cell phone full blast.

154
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,213
I'm going to use the sound

155
00:09:25,213 --> 00:09:27,113
to figure out where the wiretap is and crush it.

156
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:33,013
You have a driver's license?

157
00:09:33,013 --> 00:09:35,513
-Yes. -A driver's license is something

158
00:09:35,513 --> 00:09:37,913
that helps identify you, right?

159
00:09:37,913 --> 00:09:41,913
Why didn't you show it to the inspector a while ago?

160
00:09:41,913 --> 00:09:44,013
I didn't want to show it to him

161
00:09:44,013 --> 00:09:46,565
because my picture on it is ugly.

162
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:47,913
How do you like it?

163
00:09:47,913 --> 00:09:49,813
The fruit juice that I got for you

164
00:09:49,813 --> 00:09:52,013
at the vending machine on our way here.

165
00:09:52,013 --> 00:09:55,113
Yep. It's really delicious.

166
00:09:55,113 --> 00:09:59,713
The third one already.

167
00:09:59,713 --> 00:10:01,713
Here's one too.

168
00:10:01,713 --> 00:10:05,413
Another one?

169
00:10:05,413 --> 00:10:08,113
What's with this room? It really smells!

170
00:10:08,113 --> 00:10:11,113
What is it? This smell?

171
00:10:11,113 --> 00:10:14,593
There seems to be a wiretap set up in this room too.

172
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:15,813
You know what.

173
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:18,597
I haven't seen Conan or Ms. Kei anywhere since a while ago.

174
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:22,601
Never mind them for now. First, for the wiretaps.

175
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,621
It seems that the wiretap is under the bed.

176
00:10:43,713 --> 00:10:46,013
There's a large suitcase shoved in under here.

177
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:47,213
Move aside, will you?

178
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,627
Yes, sir.

179
00:10:51,113 --> 00:10:54,013
Darn! It's so heavy.

180
00:10:57,013 --> 00:10:59,113
So the wiretap's in here?

181
00:10:59,113 --> 00:11:02,013
It seems that the smell's coming from here too.

182
00:11:02,013 --> 00:11:04,413
Let's open it, at any rate.

183
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,150
It seems the wiretap's under the bed.

184
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,950
There's a huge suitcase under the bed.

185
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,150
Move aside, will you?

186
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,689
Yes, sir.

187
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:56,250
Darn! It's so heavy.

188
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:00,699
So the wiretap's in here?

189
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,650
It seems that the smell's coming from here too.

190
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,350
Let's open it, anyway.

191
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,550
Why is there a corpse in the suitcase?

192
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,719
Rather. Who is he anyway?

193
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:23,050
He's pretty small, isn't he?

194
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,050
He seems to have been beaten to death.

195
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,950
I guess he's been dead for a little more than a day.

196
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:31,950
Just as I thought. The wiretap is in here.

197
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,450
At any rate, let's ask Kei, the resident of this room about this.

198
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:39,050
But, I don't think she's here already.

199
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:45,350
When I went pass the front door a while ago, her boots were gone.

200
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,350
Back then, I thought she had put them back in the shoe box.

201
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,550
It's also thinkable that she fled

202
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,550
when she found out we were going to search the rooms for the wiretaps,

203
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,350
because she figured that we would eventually find this suitcase.

204
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,150
Then, are you saying that the one who killed this man is Kei?

205
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,850
I can't conclude it to be so yet, though.

206
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,769
But, I'm also bothered that Conan's shoes are gone too.

207
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:12,771
No! Why?

208
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:13,950
I wonder...

209
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,250
Maybe he went after her who fled

210
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,250
or maybe he was kidnapped by her.

211
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,350
I'll try calling Conan.

212
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,783
I text mailed Kei just now,

213
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:27,750
but I guess she wouldn't answer it if she fled.

214
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,050
Mail?

215
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,250
-From Kei? -Yeah.

216
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:38,050
"I guess you found the corpse since you're mailing me.

217
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:41,350
I'm planning to let this boy go at daybreak

218
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,750
but if you interfere with me making a run for it and contact the police,

219
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,807
I cannot assure the safety of this boy."

220
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:51,850
Which means that Kei killed this man after all?

221
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,950
It could be that she also killed the man

222
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,450
who shot himself to death at the detective agency.

223
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,750
No.

224
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:04,150
But, there was practically no gun residue detected on her.

225
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:07,950
Which means that she didn't fire the gun, doesn't it?

226
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,650
That's only IF, maybe, that is.

227
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,750
But, we've got a problem on our hands, don't we?

228
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,650
We found another corpse

229
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:18,837
and the culprit's got Conan with her,

230
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,050
yet we can't do a thing till daybreak.

231
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:26,845
Only if that brat would secretly let us know where he is.

232
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:29,750
That's right! Maybe Dr. Agasa would be able to figure it out!

233
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,450
Dr. Agasa?

234
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,950
Who is he?

235
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,050
He's an acquaintance of Conan.

236
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:40,250
And Conan usually wears a detective badge, with GPS function.

237
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,450
Dr. Agasa has a pair of pursuit glasses that can pinpoint Conan's location.

238
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,450
If something so convenient exists, please by all means contact him.

239
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:54,873
The number you have called is either switched off

240
00:14:54,873 --> 00:14:58,150
or out of service range.

241
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,150
What?

242
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,887
Conan's been kidnapped?

243
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:10,889
Moreover, by a murderer?

244
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:13,450
Yep. That's why I want you to pursue Conan's detective badge

245
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,650
with the pursuit glasses!

246
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,650
Okay.

247
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,350
I can pursue him with my spare glasses.

248
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,550
I'm sorry. I've got another call coming in.

249
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,901
Maybe it's from Conan.

250
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:24,903
Let me know when you find him!

251
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:26,550
Hello? Conan?

252
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,907
Why'd you hang up all of sudden?

253
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:30,909
Don't you like me or what?

254
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:32,550
Masumi.

255
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,850
Sorry! A lot have been going on and I'm a bit panicked, you see.

256
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,917
Conan seems to be in trouble!

257
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:40,919
Conan?

258
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:43,950
But, how on earth do you intend to pursue him?

259
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,925
Isn't your Beetle out for repair right now?

260
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,450
Yeah. Although it's something that can't usually be done,

261
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,850
I guess we've got no choice but to ask the cab driver to go after him.

262
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,650
Would you like me to pursue him with my car, then?

263
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,150
I'm sorry.

264
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,450
I wasn't eavesdropping or anything

265
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,941
but I came to share some of this cream stew

266
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:06,450
when I heard your disquieting conversation.

267
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,947
Subaru!

268
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,550
Come, let's hurry if we're going after him.

269
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,750
But...

270
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:18,150
Okay. Just lend us your car key then.

271
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,350
Doc and I will go after him.

272
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,050
I could do so,

273
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,650
but that car's got a habit

274
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,350
and has to be driven by me, otherwise.

275
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,250
Then, why don't I pursue him together with you, Subaru.

276
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,550
Yes, I don't mind.

277
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,250
If you don't mind staying back here all alone impatiently,

278
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,550
waiting for word on whether he's safe or not.

279
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,950
If it's okay with you, I'd recommend that you come along too.

280
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,985
Of course, I'm not forcing you to if you don't want to.

281
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:52,991
I see.

282
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,250
A woman called Kei Kashizuka was being held hostage

283
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,050
by a man who shot himself to death

284
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,950
in the restroom of the Mouri Detective Agency.

285
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:03,650
You gave her a lift to her condo,

286
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,003
but when you got there you found

287
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:08,250
the dead body of another man inside a suitcase there.

288
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,009
By the time you realized it, she had kidnapped Conan.

289
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,850
Then, she mails and tells you that if you contact the police,

290
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,013
his safety would not be assured?

291
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,550
Yup.

292
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,017
I really don't know what's going on already.

293
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:22,250
Well, if that man's belongings and the circumstances at the site

294
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,023
are just as you've told me.

295
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:27,350
I think he already knows what's going on.

296
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,750
He?

297
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,450
At any rate, I'll head on over right now.

298
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,950
Are you coming too, Masumi?

299
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,450
Yeah.

300
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:41,050
I'd like to meet Mr. Kogoro's disciple that you've told me about too.

301
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,550
The smell's subsided a bit after the window was opened.

302
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,047
But, what shall we do?

303
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:51,050
Should we contact the police, after all?

304
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,051
Yeah.

305
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:56,250
But, there's something strange about this room.

306
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,057
What do you mean strange?

307
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,450
There are only men's shoes in the shoe cabinet.

308
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,350
The same with the laundry and in the closet,

309
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,750
all there are, are men's clothes.

310
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,250
Which means that the one who was living here

311
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,650
was just Kei's older brother who passed away?

312
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:16,150
You mean you investigated all that in such a short time?

313
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,650
I'm not sure yet, but it's for sure that the resident

314
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,450
of this room was very interested in a certain incident

315
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:24,650
that happened the other day.

316
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,550
A certain incident?

317
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,950
True.

318
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,850
News and Talk and Variety shows are recorded one after the other.

319
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:37,750
Moreover, only the articles concerning the bank robbery incident

320
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,099
the other day are cut out and edited.

321
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:43,101
This is the video footage that's been aired since this morning

322
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:47,550
of the three bank robbers taken on the surveillance camera.

323
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,150
If I remember correctly, it was a threesome

324
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,750
consisting of a small guy, thin guy and hefty guy.

325
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,113
That's right. The image of the hefty guy

326
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:57,650
firing the gun was also aired.

327
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:01,119
Although the person who was shot was out of the scene and not visible.

328
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,650
Now, the funeral of the man, Mr. Kenya Shono,

329
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,125
the bank clerk who intervened and was shot to death at this time,

330
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,350
was held last night.

331
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,150
The long line of people who were touched by his action,

332
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,150
and attended the funeral continued until after midnight.

333
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,850
This man is...

334
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:19,137
Kei's older brother who was on Kei's cell phone's standby display!

335
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:22,450
But, why are their last names different?

336
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,950
Besides, isn't it strange?

337
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,650
If the person who was living here was Kei's older brother,

338
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:29,950
he couldn't have edited this morning's news?

339
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,350
Well, regardless of who was living here,

340
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,150
to think that the person kept a collection of this news

341
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,750
and talk and variety shows.

342
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,750
This person was most likely, a super crime freak,

343
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,350
the bereaved member of the deceased

344
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,450
who had his mind set on taking revenge, or more naturally,

345
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,850
the bank robber himself.

346
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,167
True.

347
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:53,550
At any rate, let's investigate this room a bit more.

348
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,350
Even so, there's nowhere else to look

349
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,850
but the computer that is left in the bedroom already.

350
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:01,179
Oh, uh.

351
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:03,450
Why are you my father's disciple

352
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,183
when you're already a really sharp detective?

353
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:07,750
No matter how you look at it, you're way...

354
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,650
Although Mouri Sensei acts to be troubled like he is now,

355
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,550
the fact is that he has already seen through the truth,

356
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,250
and is just testing me.

357
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,850
It was the same during the DNA case the other day too,

358
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,550
and the tragedy of the man

359
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,350
who shot himself to death this afternoon occurred

360
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,150
because I haughtily exposed my deduction.

361
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,211
I'm sure that Sensei would've coped with it in a much better way!

362
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:35,213
I'm still a mere greenhorn yet.

363
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,050
I'm sorry to trouble you, Subaru.

364
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:01,239
Don't be. Then, shall we? Where to, first of all?

365
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,241
Hold it a sec.

366
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,750
For now, head over to Ooishi Highway please.

367
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,850
I'll inform you of the details when we get closer.

368
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,550
Roger.

369
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,550
Welcome!

370
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,850
-Fill it up regular. -Yes, ma'am.

371
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,750
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to use the restroom.

372
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,350
Yes, ma'am.

373
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:45,403
Go inside the station, and it's beyond to the right.

374
00:23:45,403 --> 00:23:47,405
Thank you.

375
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

376
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,423
"Change"

377
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,858
Hey, Conan, are you okay?

378
00:24:07,858 --> 00:24:09,700
Sleeping is reserved especially for me.
