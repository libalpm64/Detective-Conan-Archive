1
00:00:12,622 --> 00:00:15,022
I'm really looking forward to the fireflies.

2
00:00:15,022 --> 00:00:16,722
I wish they'd hurry up and come.

3
00:00:16,722 --> 00:00:17,722
Yes.

4
00:00:17,722 --> 00:00:22,922
"Michitake Owada (47)"

5
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:25,122
Hello, Owada here.

6
00:00:25,122 --> 00:00:26,722
This is Nakamine speaking.

7
00:00:26,722 --> 00:00:29,622
Nakamine, where are you right now?

8
00:00:30,622 --> 00:00:32,322
The firefly song?

9
00:00:33,522 --> 00:00:35,222
Because we're driving carefully,

10
00:00:35,222 --> 00:00:37,622
we might arrive later than planned.

11
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:40,019
But we've passed the Akazawa Bridge,

12
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:42,322
and we'll be there in about 15 minutes.

13
00:00:42,322 --> 00:00:43,522
Is that so?

14
00:00:43,522 --> 00:00:46,922
Make sure you guys drive carefully.

15
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:48,422
"Tokurou Nakamine (28)" -I got it.

16
00:00:48,422 --> 00:00:49,722
See you.

17
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:56,035
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

18
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,522
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

19
00:00:58,522 --> 00:01:00,522
Young people crash during a pepping up the village event.

20
00:01:00,522 --> 00:01:02,822
The light of the fireflies shine light on the truth.

21
00:01:02,822 --> 00:01:04,622
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:04,622 --> 00:01:06,422
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:06,422 --> 00:01:08,422
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

24
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,970
"The Fireflies Shine Light on the Truth"

25
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,370
He said he'll be here in 15 minutes.

26
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,570
I want to see the fireflies quick.

27
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,165
It's almost time.

28
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:08,167
The fireflies serve as the trump card

29
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:09,670
of this village's sightseeing spot.

30
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,171
All of the villagers are counting on them.

31
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:15,570
The shrine used to gather tourists before.

32
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,070
Yes.

33
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,470
People were pretty crazy about the shrine

34
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,970
that's inside the cave.

35
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,570
That's why Priest Owada here came up with the idea of breeding fireflies,

36
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,470
but it was difficult to raise funds.

37
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,470
But you did manage to, right?

38
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:39,070
Yes. It's all thanks to the village head's son, Nakamine.

39
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,970
What about the matter regarding Aoi?

40
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,203
Well...

41
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:46,670
He said that in exchange for his fundraising service,

42
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,670
"Aoi Owada (22)" -he wants to marry my daughter Aoi.

43
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,870
And how did Aoi reply?

44
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,470
She gave him the cold shoulder.

45
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,570
Nakamine abuses

46
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,870
"Tatsuma Kashiwa (26)" -the fact that he's the village head's son,

47
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,970
he beats people up and fools around with girls.

48
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,670
But since he's the youth group's leader,

49
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,470
he still helps us at times like this.

50
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,570
-Here it comes. -Here it comes.

51
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,229
Alright, let's go.

52
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:11,870
-Yes. -Let's go.

53
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,070
Hey, turn off the streetlight.

54
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,970
"Shuuichirou Tarumi (26)" -Tarumi,

55
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,249
thanks for the good work.

56
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,470
No.

57
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,170
-Nakamine, I thank you too. -Tarumi, open it.

58
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,255
Right.

59
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,170
Awesome!

60
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,370
Pretty!

61
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,770
Amazing.

62
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,270
Unlike the city,

63
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,770
it's dark here so we can see clearly.

64
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,770
Yes.

65
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,970
Alright. I'll catch you.

66
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,070
Wait up...

67
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,770
Right here...

68
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,570
Where'd it go?

69
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,070
Where are you, firefly?

70
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,305
Did you know?

71
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,770
A firefly's mouth is undeveloped,

72
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,309
so it can only ingest water.

73
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,170
Once the nutrient it stored during its larval form is used up,

74
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,570
it dies.

75
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,870
"Officer Narutaki (59)"

76
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,370
Mr. Narutaki, so you're here.

77
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,570
Priest Owada?

78
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,329
How pretty they are.

79
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:51,870
I couldn't help but think how nice it'd be

80
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,070
if I could show them to Maya.

81
00:05:58,337 --> 00:06:00,339
Is something wrong?

82
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,970
No, it's nothing.

83
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,353
How unfortunate.

84
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,470
A landslide struck his house last year.

85
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,570
He lost his family because of that.

86
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,770
You mentioned that in the letter you sent.

87
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,370
About a man who lost his cute granddaughter because of that.

88
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,870
Yes, that was Mr. Narutaki.

89
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,370
He's a local police officer, right?

90
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,370
It really gave me the creeps, the road was narrow...

91
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,375
Where's Nakamine?

92
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,370
I want to thank him.

93
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,170
Where could he be?

94
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,670
Let me call him.

95
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,070
Hello?

96
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,389
Is this Nakamine? Where are you?

97
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,170
What?

98
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,470
Hey, who's over there?

99
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,870
What did Nakamine say?

100
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,470
I don't know.

101
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,670
All he said was,

102
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,970
"I'm at Eboshi Rock, help me." in a painful voice.

103
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,270
-What? -Where's this Eboshi Rock?

104
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,870
It's a rock upstream.

105
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,170
Let's take the truck.

106
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,170
Yes.

107
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,415
What's up?

108
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,417
Well, you see...

109
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:21,170
The key, I can't find the key.

110
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,370
Maybe Mr. Nakamine took it with him.

111
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,870
Mr. Nakamine.

112
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,457
Mr. Nakamine, are you there?

113
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:01,570
How is he?

114
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,870
Smells like almond...

115
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,070
What? Don't tell me it's cyanide type poison?

116
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,270
Poison?

117
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,970
There's a drink bottle.

118
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,477
Was there poison in here?

119
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,870
Fireflies.

120
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:29,270
Let's organize the outline of the case

121
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,491
before the guys from the precinct arrive here to back us up.

122
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:34,493
The whereabouts of Mr. Nakamine,

123
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:36,970
who came to deliver the fireflies for some reason became unknown.

124
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,070
When you, Mr. Tarumi placed a call to him using your cell phone,

125
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,170
he seemed to be struggling with something

126
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:42,770
and just saying, Eboshi Rock.

127
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,270
Someone seems to have been near him.

128
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,505
Yes, sir.

129
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:49,070
You all rushed over to him

130
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,870
but found Mr. Nakmine dead in his own car.

131
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:57,370
But, I don't think Mr. Nakmine could drive.

132
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,170
Because it seems that he broke his right leg.

133
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,521
In other words, after letting the fireflies go,

134
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:05,970
he went to Eboshi Rock with someone who drove him there,

135
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,870
and was poisoned and killed.

136
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,533
Did that firefly get in here when we got in the car?

137
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:22,541
Who're you people?

138
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,543
We're members of the Youth Detective Squad.

139
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,545
We thought we'd help with the case.

140
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,070
Youth Detective Squad?

141
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,549
This is not for children.

142
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:32,551
Hurry home and go to bed.

143
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:34,553
That's why I told you not to.

144
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,870
Mayu.

145
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:39,970
Grandpa.

146
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,170
I'm sure that Mr. Narutaki recalled his grandchild.

147
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,170
Even I was surprised too.

148
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:57,270
A girl named Mayu who looked just like me died in a landslide?

149
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,970
The mountains are becoming more prone to landslides.

150
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,070
I think too many trees have been cut.

151
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,370
I always cold sweat when it starts to rain hard.

152
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,070
Father.

153
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,970
Aoi, come here for a while.

154
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:14,593
Where were you after the fireflies were released?

155
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:15,770
Where?

156
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:20,599
I don't think so, but were you seeing Mr. Nakamine?

157
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:21,770
I wasn't.

158
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,570
It's that guy after all,

159
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,270
so I was worried about what he might do.

160
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,370
Did you hear about Mr. Kashiwa...

161
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,570
I'm telling you, that's not it.

162
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,609
What's not it?

163
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,970
Well, what about Mr. Kashiwagi?

164
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:38,170
According to Tarumi,

165
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,170
he was really given a bad time.

166
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,621
Tatsuma,

167
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:44,623
if your late father finds out that the number one elite

168
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:47,870
of the village got stingy about donating,

169
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,970
his heart would grieve.

170
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,370
Talk softer.

171
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,970
They'll hear you.

172
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,070
This is how loud I normally talk.

173
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,470
If the Kashiwagi family is going to go out of their way to help me,

174
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,639
it'll make it easier for me to talk to the villagers.

175
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,870
Am I right, Tarumi?

176
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,170
True.

177
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,170
So, you're all it takes to get the people

178
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,770
to start an event to pep up the village.

179
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,470
My, my...

180
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,270
You're the village head's son.

181
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,270
Long time no see.

182
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,070
It's been so long, Mrs. Kashiwagi.

183
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,670
My, it sure has been a long time.

184
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,670
I wonder what he wants.

185
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,570
Tatsuma, hurry and invite him in.

186
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,670
It seems he was bawled out by his mother later.

187
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,669
Saying why doesn't he help with the village revitalisation.

188
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:32,970
She doesn't know

189
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:36,970
that the estate her husband left behind is on the verge of bankruptcy.

190
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,170
I'll tell you again,

191
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,070
I don't care if you're childhood friends,

192
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,370
I'm against you marrying Mr. Kashiwagi.

193
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,685
With a house on the verge of bankruptcy

194
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:48,370
and a mother whose coming along,

195
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,470
I know how tough it will be for you.

196
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,470
Watch your step because it's slippery.

197
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,701
Okay.

198
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:05,270
It's really strange that there's a shrine inside a cave.

199
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,470
I wonder if there aren't any fireflies here?

200
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,170
Fireflies come this way.

201
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,711
"Come, come, come, fireflies..."

202
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,715
Come to think of it, back then I heard the firefly song.

203
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,721
Hello, Owada here.

204
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:24,270
This is Nakamine speaking.

205
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:27,470
Nakamine, where are you right now?

206
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:31,470
Go for it, Youth Detective Squad!

207
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,970
The police detective is going to scold you again.

208
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,070
He's not here, so I'll be fine.

209
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,737
He's at the shrine office outside.

210
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:40,739
Support from the precinct has arrived

211
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:43,170
and a formal investigation has begun.

212
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,770
Did you find something new?

213
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:48,370
As for the drink bottle,

214
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,751
it seems to have been Mr. Nakamine's favourite drink.

215
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:54,070
The inside of the bottle that was left behind

216
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,755
seems to have been washed thoroughly.

217
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,470
It was washed?

218
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,761
Aoi, you're there, aren't you?

219
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:05,470
You can make contact with the shrine office with that.

220
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,470
Aoi, a person from the police wants to see you.

221
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,781
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

222
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,770
The fact is...

223
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,791
We've been asking around from last night to all day today

224
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,470
and have come up with an unfortunate result.

225
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,970
What's this?

226
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,797
The chief priest forgot to turn the microphone off.

227
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:40,799
After the fireflies were released,

228
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,803
no one has seen Aoi for 30 minutes.

229
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:45,970
In other words,

230
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,970
she wasn't seen till the time the body of the victim was found.

231
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,811
But, Mr. Narutaki, it comes as no surprised

232
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:56,570
that no one saw my daughter in some place dark like that, does it?

233
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,370
However, when we checked,

234
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:02,170
everyone acknowledged the presence of everyone else.

235
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,770
Because we bring our faces close together

236
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,070
when watching the fireflies.

237
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,070
I mean, we've only got very little space.

238
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,770
The only people none of us saw are

239
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,833
Ms. Aoi Owada and one more person.

240
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,170
The same goes for me too.

241
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,370
Mr. Nakamine was all for Aoi,

242
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,570
so if she asked him to come

243
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,843
he would go without any doubts to Eboshi Rock with her.

244
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:27,270
And if she gave him the poisoned drink there.

245
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:30,270
It would apply to me too, then.

246
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:34,853
But, I don't think Mr. Nakamine would open his heart to you.

247
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,370
Either way, I'm in safe zone.

248
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,670
Thank god.

249
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,861
Not too fast.

250
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:45,770
You're still a suspect.

251
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,470
I hear Mr. Nakamine was angry

252
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,170
that you stole the money for catching the fireflies.

253
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,770
No... That's not true at all.

254
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,170
It was a misunderstanding.

255
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,470
I explained everything and Nakamine understood.

256
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,670
Genta, where did you get that flashlight?

257
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,270
You had it with you since last night, right?

258
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,885
I forgot to return it...

259
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:10,270
It was in the truck that brought the fireflies.

260
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,770
Will you show that to me?

261
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,170
Why?

262
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,895
If I remember correctly, back then...

263
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:21,770
-Nakamine, I thank you too. -Tarumi, open it.

264
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,170
I see. That's the story.

265
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:36,439
Aoi, do you have anything to say?

266
00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:39,439
You do have something to say.

267
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:44,639
Mr. Agasa.

268
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,839
Don't worry, Mr. Owada, your daughter is not the culprit.

269
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,931
Amateurs keep out of this.

270
00:15:53,139 --> 00:15:54,639
It'll be over soon.

271
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,339
So long as you disclose the crime that Mr. Tarumi committed.

272
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:02,039
What's this about the crime I committed?

273
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,539
You're the one, aren't you?

274
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:06,939
The one who killed Mr. Nakamine with the poisoned drink?

275
00:16:06,939 --> 00:16:08,939
Cut out the joke please.

276
00:16:08,939 --> 00:16:12,951
When Mr. Nakamine died, I was with all of you, right?

277
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:16,139
You put on an act saying that Mr. Nakamine died

278
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:17,739
while you were on the phone with him,

279
00:16:17,739 --> 00:16:20,959
because Mr. Nakamine was already dead at that time.

280
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,139
What?

281
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,039
Wait a second.

282
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,739
I was with my friends all the while

283
00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:28,239
after releasing the fireflies.

284
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:30,969
Just when did I ever go to Eboshi Rock?

285
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:33,939
Before you released the fireflies.

286
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:36,339
You received a call from Mr. Nakamine

287
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:38,977
while on your way to delivering the fireflies

288
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:41,539
but didn't you hear the melody of the firefly song

289
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:42,981
from the telephone then?

290
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:45,339
That's right.

291
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:48,239
It was a tune that came from the 1cent candy store

292
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:50,739
on the way to Eboshi Rock.

293
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,039
In other words, back then,

294
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:57,539
Mr. Nakamine was in the truck that Mr. Tarumi was driving

295
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:00,739
and heading towards Eboshi Rock.

296
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:03,639
He let Mr. Nakamine off at Eboshi Rock,

297
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:06,439
and came to the riverside alone.

298
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:08,139
That can't be

299
00:17:08,139 --> 00:17:12,639
because we heard Mr. Nakamine's voice when the fireflies were released.

300
00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:15,739
That was just a simple trick.

301
00:17:15,739 --> 00:17:17,439
This is what he used.

302
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,021
What? It's just a flashlight.

303
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:25,023
In fact, this is...

304
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:29,027
Hey, turn off the streetlight.

305
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:31,339
This is...

306
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:33,439
Tarumi, open it.

307
00:17:34,739 --> 00:17:38,539
This is a flashlight type voice recorder.

308
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:40,139
You used this to make it look like

309
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:42,639
you were conversing with Mr. Nakamine, weren't you?

310
00:17:42,639 --> 00:17:47,739
I see, that's why he didn't answer when I called him.

311
00:17:47,739 --> 00:17:49,439
Exactly.

312
00:17:49,439 --> 00:17:54,339
Mr. Tarumi, when you were heading for Eboshi Rock with the truck

313
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:58,239
you looked inside the truck and seemed strangely flustered.

314
00:17:58,239 --> 00:18:00,039
That's because you couldn't find this,

315
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:02,039
that was supposed to be in the truck.

316
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:07,065
The fact is that one of the children inadvertently took it.

317
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:11,069
You probably said the following to Mr. Nakamine.

318
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:13,071
Aoi wants to see you,

319
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:16,539
but she doesn't want her father to find out about this.

320
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:18,339
Therefore, you told him to establish an alibi

321
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:21,439
and sneak over to Eboshi Rock.

322
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:24,039
Mr. Nakamine was completely deceived.

323
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:26,839
He had you take him to Eboshi Rock,

324
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,839
and recorded his own voice in the voice recorder,

325
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,839
to use it to establish his alibi.

326
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:34,239
Then he waited for Aoi in his own car

327
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,339
that he had taken to Eboshi Rock beforehand.

328
00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:40,239
You then, handed him the poisoned drink.

329
00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:47,105
He drank the drink while waiting for Aoi, and died.

330
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:48,539
Nonsense!

331
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:51,109
If I went to Eboshi Rock before releasing the fireflies,

332
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,739
why were fireflies flying around in the car?

333
00:18:54,739 --> 00:18:56,739
Just because you wanted to say this,

334
00:18:56,739 --> 00:19:00,239
you released the firefly in the car.

335
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,239
When and how?

336
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:05,123
Very audacious indeed.

337
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:10,139
You got to the victim's car just a bit earlier than me.

338
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:12,339
That's when you switched

339
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:14,039
the bottle with the poison in it

340
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,739
to the one with firefly inside it.

341
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:20,239
The bottle was washed thoroughly

342
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:22,639
to put firefly inside it.

343
00:19:26,439 --> 00:19:28,339
Let's hear you out at the station.

344
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,839
Aoi!

345
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:38,139
Mr. Tatsuma!

346
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:46,139
-Ai! -Mayu!

347
00:19:46,139 --> 00:19:47,639
Ai!

348
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:55,739
What's that sound?

349
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:58,939
It's a landslide.

350
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:14,639
Are you all alright?

351
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:19,197
Yes.

352
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:21,199
-We're fine. -Where's Ai?

353
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:22,839
Over here.

354
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:23,839
Darn.

355
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:28,039
Tarumi!

356
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:29,207
Cut out doing stupid things.

357
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:31,209
You have nowhere to escape.

358
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:32,039
Shut up.

359
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,639
-Mayu! -Ai!

360
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:36,639
What?

361
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:39,239
Fireflies, fireflies!

362
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,939
Who cares about fireflies?

363
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:42,339
I wouldn't say that.

364
00:20:42,339 --> 00:20:44,139
Fireflies in here are just proof

365
00:20:44,139 --> 00:20:46,739
that there's a way out of here, right?

366
00:20:46,739 --> 00:20:48,239
I see.

367
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:53,239
Okay, this side.

368
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:55,233
-Mayu. -Hey.

369
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:57,739
If you move, this kid dies.

370
00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:01,239
There're two fireflies now.

371
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:02,839
No.

372
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:05,243
It's just the reflection in the water of the puddle.

373
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:07,245
I'm sure Ai noticed it.

374
00:21:16,739 --> 00:21:17,739
You brat.

375
00:21:17,739 --> 00:21:18,839
Mayu!

376
00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:23,261
Darn.

377
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:37,739
We did it.

378
00:21:40,939 --> 00:21:43,039
Are you okay, Mayu?

379
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,539
Mayu!

380
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:47,285
I'm not Mayu.

381
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:52,639
But, thank you.

382
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:56,339
I'm glad.

383
00:21:56,339 --> 00:22:00,839
I'm really glad.

384
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:28,939
Tarumi's motive for murder

385
00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:31,839
was not only because he used the money that was to be used for fireflies,

386
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:34,039
but also because he was embezzling money

387
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,139
from Mr. Nakamine's father's company,

388
00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:37,739
and because what he was doing was about to come to light.

389
00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:40,139
I was worried about how things would turn out at one point,

390
00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:42,839
but all that ends well is well.

391
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,639
You can say that again.

392
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:54,039
They seem to be doing good too.

393
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:55,139
I guess so.

394
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

395
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,132
"Reading glasses".

396
00:24:06,132 --> 00:24:08,420
In the next episode, there's going to be a big fuss over a lottery ticket.
