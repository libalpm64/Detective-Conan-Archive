1
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:06,738
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:06,738 --> 00:00:08,638
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:10,338
Yuka's bluebird that's supposed to bring happiness

4
00:00:10,338 --> 00:00:12,238
turns into a case.

5
00:00:12,238 --> 00:00:13,938
Hurry to the scene Youth Detective Squad!

6
00:00:13,938 --> 00:00:15,338
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:15,338 --> 00:00:17,138
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:17,138 --> 00:00:19,438
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:18,621
"The Youth Detective Squad Pursues the Bluebird"

10
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:26,521
It sure is cold again today, too.

11
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,921
They say the temperature

12
00:02:27,921 --> 00:02:31,021
is gonna be like it was in late November for three whole days.

13
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:32,221
Yuka.

14
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:35,721
Konno from Class C.

15
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:39,621
She's always standing in front of the cage watching the birds.

16
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:40,921
Yuka!

17
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:44,421
Ayumi.

18
00:02:44,421 --> 00:02:46,421
Do you like birds?

19
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:48,221
Yes, I love them!

20
00:02:48,221 --> 00:02:50,721
I have a budgie at home, too.

21
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:53,321
A blue one.

22
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:54,721
What's its name?

23
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:55,721
Chicchi.

24
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:57,921
He's two years old and perches on people's hands.

25
00:02:57,921 --> 00:03:00,121
He also talks just a little bit.

26
00:03:00,121 --> 00:03:01,521
You mean he speaks words?

27
00:03:01,521 --> 00:03:03,221
I want to see him!

28
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:05,921
Okay. Do you want to stop over at my house today?

29
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:07,421
May I go, too?

30
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,421
Me, too! May I?

31
00:03:10,521 --> 00:03:12,721
You're Conan and Ai, right?

32
00:03:12,721 --> 00:03:14,521
-Oh, yes. -Oh, yes.

33
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:16,221
You two are also welcome to come.

34
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:18,721
But if all of us go at once...

35
00:03:18,721 --> 00:03:19,921
Don't worry about it.

36
00:03:19,921 --> 00:03:23,621
My mother is at work and won't be home until early evening.

37
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:26,721
Your parents are both working. Same with me.

38
00:03:26,721 --> 00:03:29,221
In my case, it's a bit different though.

39
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:34,521
Yuka's father died of an illness two years ago.

40
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:36,021
Is that right?

41
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:43,521
Hey. Let's go together, Conan and Ai.

42
00:03:43,521 --> 00:03:47,421
Okay, let's all go see the hand perching budgie!

43
00:03:47,421 --> 00:03:48,621
Let's go!

44
00:03:48,621 --> 00:03:50,121
We did it!

45
00:03:50,121 --> 00:03:51,521
What did we do?

46
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:57,221
Do you know how to tell the difference between an adult male and female?

47
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:00,521
Is it the size of their bodies?

48
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:02,121
Is it the pattern on the feathers?

49
00:04:02,121 --> 00:04:03,921
No.

50
00:04:03,921 --> 00:04:06,521
It's by the colour of the cere of the parakeet which is above the beak.

51
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:09,121
Males have blue ceres while females have brown ones.

52
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:10,621
Exactly!

53
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:13,321
But despite Chicchi being a male,

54
00:04:13,321 --> 00:04:15,721
his cere has recently been turning brownish.

55
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:17,021
I wonder why?

56
00:04:20,821 --> 00:04:22,021
Are we not there yet?

57
00:04:31,321 --> 00:04:34,621
Huh? The door. It's unlocked.

58
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:35,921
What?

59
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:38,521
Maybe it's a thief?

60
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:43,221
Stand back, everybody!

61
00:04:45,021 --> 00:04:46,121
Okay!

62
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:48,221
All right!

63
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:52,021
You two...

64
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:53,021
Go ahead!

65
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:54,721
I'm ready!

66
00:05:00,021 --> 00:05:01,321
Who are you?

67
00:05:01,321 --> 00:05:03,021
A thief?

68
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:06,421
Hi! Welcome home, Yuka!

69
00:05:06,421 --> 00:05:08,021
Do you know him?

70
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:10,321
No, I don't.

71
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:11,921
She's saying she doesn't know you!

72
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:13,621
You're a thief after all!

73
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:16,921
No, I'm Shinya Sakaguchi.

74
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:20,221
I work at the Beika University research lab of the Engineering Department.

75
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:23,221
I'm a friend of Yuka's mother.

76
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:27,421
Yuka's mother manages a gardening shop in Haido City,

77
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:29,921
and since she's going to be coming home late from work today,

78
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:33,921
I was asked to eat out together with Yuka tonight.

79
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:37,521
Your mother said that she told you so this morning, too.

80
00:05:37,521 --> 00:05:39,621
She didn't say anything to me.

81
00:05:39,621 --> 00:05:41,821
-Yuka. -Please wait!

82
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:44,021
How did you come into the house?

83
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:48,021
Well, Yuka's mother told me where the house key is hidden.

84
00:05:48,021 --> 00:05:49,021
Everybody!

85
00:05:49,021 --> 00:05:51,721
Never mind him, and come on in.

86
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,221
Hello!

87
00:05:56,821 --> 00:05:58,121
In other words,

88
00:05:58,121 --> 00:06:01,621
you're very intimate friends with her mother.

89
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:04,921
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:04,921 --> 00:06:06,621
Will you stop pushing me?

91
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:11,921
It's so spacious!

92
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:13,721
The garden is nice, too.

93
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:16,821
But why are the windows all open?

94
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:18,121
Oh, well...

95
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:19,721
I just thought that it would be nice to air the room out

96
00:06:19,721 --> 00:06:21,721
before Yuka came home.

97
00:06:22,921 --> 00:06:24,421
Chicchi, I'm home!

98
00:06:25,921 --> 00:06:26,921
How cute!

99
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:28,721
Its colour is beautiful, too.

100
00:06:30,221 --> 00:06:31,521
What's the matter?

101
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:35,521
Nothing, but it seems that Chicchi's become slightly smaller.

102
00:06:36,721 --> 00:06:38,021
I don't think so.

103
00:06:38,021 --> 00:06:39,121
It's just your imagination.

104
00:06:39,121 --> 00:06:41,421
Chicchi! Chicchi!

105
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:44,321
Chicchi, "Welcome back". Say, "Welcome back".

106
00:06:46,721 --> 00:06:48,221
Strange.

107
00:06:48,221 --> 00:06:51,921
He always says welcome back when I come home, but...

108
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:55,721
I'm sure he's nervous because your friends that he doesn't know is here.

109
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:58,221
Did he talk this morning?

110
00:06:58,221 --> 00:07:00,321
He said, "Good morning" very energetically.

111
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:22,421
So ticklish!

112
00:07:27,121 --> 00:07:29,221
Its cere really is brown, isn't it?

113
00:07:29,221 --> 00:07:30,321
Right.

114
00:07:31,921 --> 00:07:33,021
Do you have a cold?

115
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:35,121
Yes, just slightly.

116
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,421
Is that why you're standing away from everyone else,

117
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:38,821
because you don't want us to catch cold?

118
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:40,221
Yes.

119
00:07:41,621 --> 00:07:45,821
I wonder why he had all the glass windows open despite having a cold?

120
00:07:45,821 --> 00:07:47,721
It sure is strange.

121
00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:49,121
Let's have some juice, okay?

122
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:58,221
Hey. Could it be that you let the bird go?

123
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:01,621
You went to the pet shop

124
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:04,021
and bought a bird that looks just like the one she had, right?

125
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:10,421
You left the windows open because the bird that fled may come back.

126
00:08:10,421 --> 00:08:11,721
I get it!

127
00:08:11,721 --> 00:08:14,721
And you bought a bird that was a bit smaller.

128
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:16,321
That's why it doesn't talk!

129
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:18,521
Come on and spit out the truth.

130
00:08:18,521 --> 00:08:20,721
No! Just what are you talking about?

131
00:08:20,721 --> 00:08:22,421
You spilled soy sauce, didn't you?

132
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:26,921
When I opened the refrigerator, I smelled soy sauce.

133
00:08:26,921 --> 00:08:28,321
Oh, right.

134
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:31,221
The soy sauce container fell a while ago when I was putting the cake

135
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:33,121
that I got for you into the refrigerator.

136
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:36,021
Don't you dare open the fridge of other people's houses without permission!

137
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,721
What's all the shouting for, Yuka?

138
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:46,121
Mother?

139
00:08:46,121 --> 00:08:47,921
Hello...

140
00:08:47,921 --> 00:08:49,321
Hello.

141
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:52,021
My client suddenly cancelled the appointment.

142
00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:55,121
Mr. Sakaguchi, let's go eat out together.

143
00:08:55,121 --> 00:08:58,621
No, I'll leave for today.

144
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,021
But...

145
00:09:06,221 --> 00:09:09,421
Conan, Ai, see you both tomorrow!

146
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:13,221
It's already late. So go home straight, okay?

147
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:14,621
Yes!

148
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:17,321
You guys go straight home and don't go rendezvousing some place together!

149
00:09:17,321 --> 00:09:20,321
Well, maybe that's not a bad idea.

150
00:09:20,321 --> 00:09:22,121
You've got to be kidding!

151
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:25,721
Oh, my. What are you all worked up about, Conan?

152
00:09:25,721 --> 00:09:28,521
Conan is as dense as ever.

153
00:09:28,521 --> 00:09:30,721
But we've got to check this out, no matter what.

154
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:32,121
Come on, let's go!

155
00:09:36,521 --> 00:09:38,921
Yes.

156
00:09:38,921 --> 00:09:40,921
A person who looks like this

157
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:45,121
did come to buy a blue parakeet about two hours ago.

158
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:46,321
Really?

159
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:47,321
Just as we thought!

160
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:48,921
It's just like what Ai said.

161
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:52,321
That man let the parakeet go!

162
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:54,021
But he...

163
00:09:54,021 --> 00:09:56,221
was holding a dead parakeet in his hand.

164
00:09:57,821 --> 00:10:01,221
And he said to give him a parakeet just like the one he was holding.

165
00:10:01,221 --> 00:10:03,221
He seemed to be in a rush, too.

166
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:09,021
It's so shocking that Chicchi was already dead.

167
00:10:09,021 --> 00:10:11,421
But Yuka said that the bird greeted her in good health this morning

168
00:10:11,421 --> 00:10:14,021
and said "Good morning", didn't she?

169
00:10:14,021 --> 00:10:17,621
Yes. Which means the bird didn't die of an illness.

170
00:10:17,621 --> 00:10:21,921
Besides, it was in a cage so it couldn't have died accidentally either.

171
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:25,421
Could it be that the man killed it?

172
00:10:25,421 --> 00:10:29,221
But if he rushed to go buy another parakeet after what happened,

173
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:32,021
at least we know that he didn't do it on purpose.

174
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:34,821
Then, did he mistakenly killed it?

175
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:41,721
What kind of work?

176
00:10:41,721 --> 00:10:42,821
Yes.

177
00:10:42,821 --> 00:10:44,821
Mr. Sakaguchi mentioned that he is working

178
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:47,621
at the research lab at Beika University, didn't he?

179
00:10:47,621 --> 00:10:50,421
I was just wondering what kind of research he was doing.

180
00:10:50,421 --> 00:10:53,121
Well, I don't really know,

181
00:10:53,121 --> 00:10:54,621
but I think he's researching some kind of drug.

182
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:55,721
-What? -What?

183
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,421
Drug?

184
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:59,821
But... It can't be!

185
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:03,221
But I'm sure it was some kind of drug.

186
00:11:03,221 --> 00:11:04,821
-Conan! -Do you have a relative...

187
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:07,121
-Don't, Ayumi! -by the name of Kitada?

188
00:11:07,121 --> 00:11:11,021
Well, because he always gets the credit.

189
00:11:11,021 --> 00:11:14,221
So this time, let's solve the truth ourselves.

190
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:16,121
But...

191
00:11:16,121 --> 00:11:17,721
Okay, Ayumi?

192
00:11:17,721 --> 00:11:18,921
Okay.

193
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:43,021
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

194
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:45,921
We're sorry to have called you out like this despite your busy schedule.

195
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:47,121
We're sorry.

196
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:51,621
Is your research lab in here?

197
00:11:51,621 --> 00:11:53,521
Yes, it is.

198
00:11:53,521 --> 00:11:55,621
May we see it?

199
00:11:55,621 --> 00:11:57,621
No, you can't.

200
00:11:57,621 --> 00:11:59,121
Why not?

201
00:11:59,121 --> 00:12:02,021
Because there are many dangerous chemicals inside.

202
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,421
Dangerous chemicals?

203
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:04,621
Just as we thought!

204
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:09,321
Actually, we went to the pet shop yesterday.

205
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,521
The employee told us everything.

206
00:12:13,521 --> 00:12:15,821
Will you please explain the situation?

207
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:25,521
I'm sorry. I lied yesterday.

208
00:12:25,521 --> 00:12:30,621
The fact is, when I got to Yuka's house, Chicchi was dead in the cage.

209
00:12:32,821 --> 00:12:35,821
Yuka really took good care of Chicchi,

210
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,121
so I thought she'd be sad if she came back and found out.

211
00:12:38,121 --> 00:12:40,921
That's why I rushed over to the pet shop

212
00:12:40,921 --> 00:12:44,021
and bought a parakeet that looked like Chicchi at the pet shop.

213
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:47,221
Then, what did you do with Chicchi that died?

214
00:12:47,221 --> 00:12:52,621
After I left Yuka's house at sundown, I buried it in a park nearby.

215
00:12:55,621 --> 00:12:57,921
Would you please take us there?

216
00:12:59,221 --> 00:13:01,621
We'd like to offer our prayers.

217
00:13:02,921 --> 00:13:05,321
Now? Well...

218
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:07,321
You can't take us?

219
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:09,321
I'm in the midst of an experiment right now.

220
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,321
I hate to say this, but maybe some other time.

221
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:13,521
-I'm sorry! -Mr. Sakaguchi!

222
00:13:13,521 --> 00:13:14,621
Hey!

223
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:18,321
There's something suspicious about him.

224
00:13:18,321 --> 00:13:21,921
There's no doubt that he's the one who killed Chicchi!

225
00:13:21,921 --> 00:13:25,921
But I wonder what he did to kill it?

226
00:13:25,921 --> 00:13:28,321
Thank you very much.

227
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:34,721
Isn't it this way?

228
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:37,621
He probably mistakenly spilled the chemical

229
00:13:37,621 --> 00:13:39,221
that he brought back from the research lab.

230
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:42,221
The chemical probably splattered into the water container of the cage

231
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,621
and the parakeet drank it.

232
00:13:46,321 --> 00:13:49,521
But that's too much of a coincidence, don't you think?

233
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:52,621
Maybe it was an aerosolized toxin!

234
00:13:53,621 --> 00:13:57,121
What's that air something about?

235
00:13:57,121 --> 00:13:59,321
Aerosolized toxin, Genta!

236
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:01,521
A process where liquid becomes gas.

237
00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:02,521
In other words,

238
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:07,621
the parakeet inhaled the vapour of a poison that he mistakenly spilled!

239
00:14:07,621 --> 00:14:10,721
If this is what happened, everything falls into place!

240
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:16,921
Mr. Sakaguchi opened the windows and door of Yuka's house

241
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:22,221
because he thought that the vaporized poison may still be left in the air.

242
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:26,821
His eyes were bloodshot and he was coughing

243
00:14:26,821 --> 00:14:30,821
because he inhaled the vaporized poison by mistake.

244
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:33,721
That's why he stayed away from us.

245
00:14:33,721 --> 00:14:37,421
He wanted to stay away from the place he spilled the poison.

246
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:41,121
I see! So the thing about him having a cold was also a lie.

247
00:14:41,121 --> 00:14:42,221
Hello!

248
00:14:43,221 --> 00:14:44,721
Hello?

249
00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:46,421
-Yuka. -Yuka.

250
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:51,421
Hello!

251
00:14:51,421 --> 00:14:53,421
Thank you for all the food yesterday!

252
00:14:53,421 --> 00:14:56,021
Not at all. I didn't do anything at all.

253
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,321
Are you shopping?

254
00:14:57,321 --> 00:15:00,121
Yes, we're having hand-wrapped sushi tonight.

255
00:15:00,121 --> 00:15:01,621
What a coincidence!

256
00:15:01,621 --> 00:15:05,421
We're going to Doc's house tonight to eat hand-wrapped sushi, too!

257
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:08,321
Doc?

258
00:15:08,321 --> 00:15:09,921
Dr. Agasa.

259
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:12,321
The inventor that lives in 2-chome.

260
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:16,221
He talks like an old fart though.

261
00:15:17,221 --> 00:15:20,121
Is Mr. Sakaguchi coming for dinner, too?

262
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:21,821
Well, I asked him over,

263
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:24,821
but he turned me down saying that he is busy tonight.

264
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:29,521
Please come over again.

265
00:15:29,521 --> 00:15:32,021
Yes, goodbye...

266
00:15:33,121 --> 00:15:37,721
Was it okay not telling them about the man?

267
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:40,121
I was wondering what we should do too, but...

268
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:43,521
Maybe we should tell them after things become clearer.

269
00:15:44,621 --> 00:15:46,721
Hello!

270
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:48,721
Oh, you've come!

271
00:15:48,721 --> 00:15:50,721
-Doc, where's Conan? -Vinegar rice.

272
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:53,021
-Conan again. -I smell vinegar rice.

273
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:54,621
It's nothing.

274
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,621
He'll probably get here soon.

275
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:59,521
Haibara, would you like me to help you with something?

276
00:15:59,521 --> 00:16:02,521
Well, would you line out the plates?

277
00:16:02,521 --> 00:16:05,121
Okay! Sure.

278
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:10,521
The point is why Mr. Sakaguchi brought the poison to Yuka's house.

279
00:16:10,521 --> 00:16:13,521
Don't tell me that he was trying to poison Yuka or her mother.

280
00:16:13,521 --> 00:16:15,521
I don't want to think that way,

281
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:17,921
but the possibility cannot be denied either.

282
00:16:17,921 --> 00:16:20,821
Then maybe he already may have...

283
00:16:20,821 --> 00:16:23,421
Cake, cake!

284
00:16:23,421 --> 00:16:26,121
He put something in the cake that he bought!

285
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:27,421
Genta.

286
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:31,221
We already ate the cake at her house yesterday.

287
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:34,521
Well, it's really not enough.

288
00:16:37,321 --> 00:16:40,121
That's right!

289
00:16:40,121 --> 00:16:45,321
Come to think of it, Yuka didn't eat the cake at all.

290
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:48,421
She probably really doesn't like Mr. Sakaguchi.

291
00:16:48,421 --> 00:16:50,921
But then, what on earth is...

292
00:16:50,921 --> 00:16:54,221
My hunch is that he just took the poison to the house

293
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,821
and hasn't done anything with it yet.

294
00:16:56,821 --> 00:16:58,321
Otherwise, we wouldn't be here taking it easy like this.

295
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:01,521
Ai, here's the soy sauce. I wonder if this will be enough?

296
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:06,621
The soy sauce container fell.

297
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:09,021
Shoots!

298
00:17:09,021 --> 00:17:10,321
Don't tell me he put it in there?

299
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:11,521
That's why Mr. Sakaguchi

300
00:17:11,521 --> 00:17:15,421
refused to have hand wrapped sushi together with them tonight!

301
00:17:15,421 --> 00:17:16,721
This is bad.

302
00:17:16,721 --> 00:17:17,821
We've got to stop them quick!

303
00:17:17,821 --> 00:17:19,021
What? What is it?

304
00:17:19,021 --> 00:17:20,021
I'm going with you!

305
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:22,521
Hey, wait!

306
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:24,921
What's up? What on earth...

307
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:26,621
I wonder...

308
00:17:26,621 --> 00:17:29,721
Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya has made the mistake of a life time!

309
00:17:29,721 --> 00:17:32,921
We should've told Conan about this to begin with!

310
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:34,921
There you go again.

311
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:37,621
What if we don't make it in time?

312
00:17:41,821 --> 00:17:43,121
-Genta! -Genta!

313
00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:57,721
The traffic light's red!

314
00:17:57,721 --> 00:17:58,821
Quick! Quick!

315
00:18:00,721 --> 00:18:02,721
Turn green! Turn green!

316
00:18:03,921 --> 00:18:06,021
Please let us make it in time!

317
00:18:12,121 --> 00:18:13,921
Let's go around to the yard!

318
00:18:16,521 --> 00:18:18,521
We made it!

319
00:18:18,521 --> 00:18:19,621
They're alive.

320
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:22,821
I'm so glad.

321
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:26,321
What's the matter, everybody?

322
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:30,321
Don't use that soy sauce! It is poisoned!

323
00:18:30,321 --> 00:18:32,021
Poison?

324
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:35,421
What're you talking about?

325
00:18:35,421 --> 00:18:37,321
It's not poisoned.

326
00:18:37,321 --> 00:18:39,421
We're already using it and eating.

327
00:18:44,421 --> 00:18:45,721
Yes!

328
00:18:47,621 --> 00:18:48,621
Conan!

329
00:18:52,221 --> 00:18:53,421
Mr. Sakaguchi...

330
00:18:56,621 --> 00:18:58,421
Just as I thought.

331
00:18:58,421 --> 00:19:00,321
I thought this is what you guys were up to!

332
00:19:00,321 --> 00:19:03,021
Conan, what brings you here?

333
00:19:03,021 --> 00:19:04,621
Based on the look on your faces,

334
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:07,621
it looks like your deduction is messed up.

335
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:15,021
Then is it true that when Mr. Sakaguchi came here, Chicchi was dead?

336
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:19,621
Yes. Very often little birds peck on food until just before they die

337
00:19:19,621 --> 00:19:23,221
and act healthy trying to hide the fact that they are ill.

338
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:24,421
Why?

339
00:19:24,421 --> 00:19:26,521
When living in flocks,

340
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:28,721
if they display any signs of being weak from an illness,

341
00:19:28,721 --> 00:19:32,121
they may become prey to an enemy and lose their life, right?

342
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:34,221
Even if the parakeet is tame enough to perch on fingers,

343
00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:36,821
it has remaining instincts of when it used to be in the wild.

344
00:19:36,821 --> 00:19:38,121
I see.

345
00:19:38,121 --> 00:19:42,621
That's why it could say "Good morning" healthily like always.

346
00:19:42,621 --> 00:19:44,721
But there were signs of an upcoming illness.

347
00:19:44,721 --> 00:19:46,221
The cere of male parakeets

348
00:19:46,221 --> 00:19:49,721
seem to change from blue to brown when they get sick.

349
00:19:51,321 --> 00:19:56,721
Right. Chicchi's cere became brown because he wasn't in good health.

350
00:19:56,721 --> 00:19:58,721
I didn't know that.

351
00:19:58,721 --> 00:20:02,721
So Mr. Sakaguchi didn't cough or have bloodshot eyes...

352
00:20:02,721 --> 00:20:05,021
Because he inhaled poison?

353
00:20:05,021 --> 00:20:09,421
No, Mr. Sakaguchi really had a cold.

354
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:11,321
He hadn't taken a bath for three days,

355
00:20:11,321 --> 00:20:14,221
so he thought that he had body odour.

356
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:16,721
That's why he opened the windows and doors

357
00:20:16,721 --> 00:20:18,621
to keep the smell from enveloping the room.

358
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:20,221
Moreover, that's the very reason why

359
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:22,721
he was standing some distance away from Yuka after she came home.

360
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:27,021
She's a girl. So I thought she'd dislike me even more if I smelled.

361
00:20:29,621 --> 00:20:31,321
I'm sorry, Yuka.

362
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:35,621
He came a while ago to tell me that I should tell you the truth.

363
00:20:35,621 --> 00:20:39,321
That it would save you from being hurt.

364
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,521
That's when I first realized how stupid I was.

365
00:20:44,021 --> 00:20:46,421
Life is invaluable.

366
00:20:46,421 --> 00:20:48,921
I think that you're regretting

367
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:51,821
the fact that you didn't realize sooner that he was ill.

368
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:55,521
But Chicchi was taken good care of by you,

369
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:57,621
and I'm sure he was really happy.

370
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:07,521
Since Chicchi's cere was brown, I mistakenly bought a female yesterday.

371
00:21:14,821 --> 00:21:15,921
It's a budgie!

372
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:17,921
The cere is blue. It's a male!

373
00:21:17,921 --> 00:21:19,721
Fantastic!

374
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:23,021
I was thinking about whether it's good or not

375
00:21:23,021 --> 00:21:25,021
to buy a new budgie right after Chicchi died but...

376
00:21:46,321 --> 00:21:48,021
Thank you.

377
00:21:59,121 --> 00:22:01,721
How lucky. You've got a family now.

378
00:23:38,921 --> 00:23:41,621
They sure are late. I wonder what they're doing?

379
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:43,721
Why don't you go ahead and eat already?

380
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:45,521
Right!

381
00:23:45,521 --> 00:23:47,921
Even if they don't roll back, I can't speak ill of them.

382
00:23:47,921 --> 00:23:50,421
Though I want to scream like a bream, but that's too fishy.

383
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:52,721
Roll it and dip it. Here goes the soy sauce.

384
00:23:55,821 --> 00:23:59,321
Whether it's sushi or a play on words, the point is how fresh they are.

385
00:24:31,948 --> 00:24:34,048
Next Conan's Hint:

386
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:36,148
"Habit"

387
00:24:36,148 --> 00:24:37,948
Do you know what my seven habits are?

388
00:24:37,948 --> 00:24:39,948
Biting nails, digging your nose...

389
00:24:39,948 --> 00:24:40,948
Hey!
