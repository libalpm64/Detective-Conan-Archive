1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,840
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,940
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,740
Ran's mom and my mom

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,740
have a deduction match that even scares Pops off.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,340
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,760
Here's your dish, sir.

9
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,560
It's scallop in ravioli with broccoli puree.

10
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,960
Looks delicious!

11
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,460
It's what you expect of a three star restaurant!

12
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,360
Excuse me, but will you bring wine that's suits this cuisine,

13
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,560
and choose one from the expensive wines, please?

14
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,160
Yes, sir.

15
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,160
Dad, are you sure? Can you pay?

16
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,060
Don't you worry.

17
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,060
I've got a big, easy job on my hands.

18
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,460
I don't remember any such request.

19
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,960
Today, while you were in school, I got a call.

20
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,860
From a wealthy madam.

21
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,260
She says that somebody in her premises is after her husband's life,

22
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,060
and she will shell out 10 million yen if I find out who it is.

23
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,560
10 million yen!

24
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,160
I don't believe it.

25
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,360
I've got the contract and 500 thousand yen deposit.

26
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,660
They seem to have enough evidence

27
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,060
that somebody on the premises is doing it.

28
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,060
You just make a little use of your brain, and the case is closed!

29
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,260
"Two Princesses of a Kind (Part 1)"

30
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:21,560
And? Did he find out who is after the rich man?

31
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,160
Well, dad went to that house

32
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,760
but their evidence turned out to be very weak.

33
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,460
Dad was completely at a loss what to do.

34
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,260
He is now drunk and asleep on the couch.

35
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,460
A shame.

36
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,260
If he has time to drinking,

37
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,760
he should use it for calling the client and declining the offer.

38
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,060
But before calling the client,

39
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,460
he got happy and partied up with the neighbors,

40
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,360
and already used up 3 million yen.

41
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,760
3 million yen, you say?

42
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,560
Holly Nelly!

43
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,560
But I suppose I can manage that amount of money.

44
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,060
And another thing...

45
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,160
Do you have anything else to say?

46
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,560
Yes.

47
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,560
He tried to get back the money, and...

48
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,760
Excuse me for interrupting.

49
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,460
What? He lost 5 million yen in horse racing?

50
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,360
I thought Pops would do it some day. And this is the day.

51
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,460
The debt in total is 8 million and 57 thousand yen.

52
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,360
What shall we do, mom?

53
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,260
Just leave him to fend for himself and come stay with me!

54
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,760
But dad talked in his sleep calling...

55
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,860
"Eri, help me. Eri, please."

56
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,960
Are you listening, mom?

57
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,160
Mom?

58
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,260
Okay. I'll be there right now, so you just wait.

59
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,560
What? Miss Kisaki!

60
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,560
You are supposed to meet with Mrs. Nakanishi at 3 o'clock.

61
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,060
Would you put it off to next week?

62
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,760
She will talk about divorcing her husband

63
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,660
but she just wants to complain about him.

64
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,560
Tell her I hate to get involved with the trouble my husband got into,

65
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,760
but I have to, and she will understand.

66
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,960
Okay.

67
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,760
Well, Miss Kuriyama, take care of the office please.

68
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,060
Okay.

69
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,860
Does she really hate to, I wonder?

70
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,060
Help... help me.

71
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,760
I had enough.

72
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,660
He has been like this.

73
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,860
Gosh.

74
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,560
I can't. Not anymore.

75
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,260
Here, I've come to you.

76
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,660
Now wake up, darling.

77
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,460
I'm full. I can't eat anymore.

78
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,160
What?

79
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,760
I can't, Yoko, dear.

80
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,460
What's that?

81
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,060
But he was really asking for help.

82
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,160
It could be this TV program.

83
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,760
This has been Yoko Okino's 4 minutes' cooking.

84
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,060
Until next week, everybody.

85
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,160
You could be right.

86
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,960
Mom, you're not leaving us?

87
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,160
No, I won't do such a childish thing.

88
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,260
But get this straight.

89
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,660
I'm doing this for you

90
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,760
and not for that dummy!

91
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,160
Yes, mom.

92
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,160
I can't eat anymore.

93
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,560
Childish enough.

94
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,560
I see.

95
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,760
So, somebody is after the life of that Mikio Fujieda.

96
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,460
You know about him, mom?

97
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,760
Yes, I heard about him.

98
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,260
He'd been playing around a lot when he was young, I heard,

99
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,360
and he made up to a young daughter of a wealthy man

100
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,160
and got married into her family.

101
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,960
Then he took advantage of the money

102
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,260
to make a small fortune in his dubious business.

103
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,860
Then, the daughter is your client?

104
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,960
No.

105
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,260
From what I heard, his wife died of an illness a half year ago,

106
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,260
so I suppose he got married again.

107
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,660
What? It's so soon after she passed away.

108
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,560
Anyway, he doesn't seem to be

109
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,460
the kind of person you'd want to protect his life of.

110
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,660
I have been waiting for you, ladies.

111
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,060
You're here on behalf of Mr. Kogoro Mouri, I presume?

112
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,260
That is correct.

113
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:29,260
I am Souhachi Ueki, the butler for the past 50 years for this house.

114
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,560
Please feel free to ask me for anything,

115
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,160
and I'll be at your service.

116
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,360
Excuse me for...

117
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,360
You have a cold?

118
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,860
No. I've got chronic asthma.

119
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,860
I apologize for the unpleasant sound I make.

120
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,560
Please come this way, ladies.

121
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,160
What a fine garden, this is.

122
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,760
The garden looks so well cared for.

123
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,260
Yes, it does. The late madam loved gardening.

124
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,960
With that gardener over there,

125
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,960
we three used to work in the garden.

126
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,460
I see.

127
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,560
The garden is marvelous!

128
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,460
Please pay no attention to him.

129
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,960
He used to be more sociable,

130
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,760
but from about the time Mr. Fujieda came into the family,

131
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,860
he stopped talking to people except for Madam and me.

132
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,260
But nowadays, when I talk to him,

133
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,860
he does not reply at all.

134
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,660
He must have liked her very much.

135
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,260
I mean my sister that died of an illness.

136
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,060
This is Mr. Shigeru Fujieda, the brother of the late madam.

137
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,860
And who are these beautiful ladies,

138
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,160
and the little one?

139
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,360
They are here on behalf of Mr. Mouri.

140
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,460
Yes, I mean, no, we are rather...

141
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,660
I am Eri Kisaki, the legal advisor for the Mouri Detective Agency.

142
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,360
I was asked to get the details of the case,

143
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,760
and when I talked of it to Miss Mouri, she got interested.

144
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
Are we inconveniencing you in any way?

145
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,060
Of course not.

146
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,860
Mr. Ueki, may I talk to you a while?

147
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,960
Excuse us, ladies.

148
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,260
See you again.

149
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,860
Say! Why didn't you say you're Mrs. Mouri?

150
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,360
If I did, they would underrate me.

151
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,260
And what's more, he looks cool and cute.

152
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,760
Mom!

153
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,960
So, it's you.

154
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,460
The one who is on behalf of the detective that is fool enough

155
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,360
to seriously take the prank that somebody is after my life,

156
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,260
and started investigating?

157
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,560
Well, this is just for routine investigation.

158
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,560
Then, do snoop around to find the culprit.

159
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,760
It's one of the workers who got insulted by the words I used on them.

160
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,960
Why spend ten million yen on this kind of nonsense?

161
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,260
Just the type of man I pictured him to be.

162
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,260
I'm with you.

163
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,660
I am so sorry, ladies.

164
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,260
He is in a bad mood today, I guess.

165
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,860
Are you his daughter, Miss?

166
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,060
No, no.

167
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,360
I'm Motoka. I'm Mikio Fujieda's wife, and your client.

168
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,360
-What? -But you are so young.

169
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,160
It's love that counts not the difference of age!

170
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,360
This much difference could be a crime.

171
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,160
But I'm so glad

172
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,860
to know that you're here on behalf of the detective.

173
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,660
Why, may I ask?

174
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,660
Because if such a beauty like you is the lover of Mikio,

175
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,860
I, Motoka, can't possibly compete!

176
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,060
Ran, should I be happy or what?

177
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,460
I'd say marginal, mom.

178
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,360
Anyway, would you show me

179
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,860
the things that point out that someone on the premises

180
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,560
is after your husband's life?

181
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,460
Yes. They are all gathered up and in the study, so follow me.

182
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,960
The memo sheets printed with a word processor that say

183
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,760
"Watch behind you!" and "I'll send you to heaven."

184
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,460
A bullet that is already used.

185
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,260
They were under your husband's pillow every night

186
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,560
for three consecutive days.

187
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,860
Yes, they were. Terrifying, aren't they?

188
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,160
If it's for fun or a joke, it's gone too far.

189
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,460
And?

190
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,960
Did you have the police look into the finger-prints on them?

191
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,560
Yes. But Mikio got mad about it

192
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,560
and shouted, "Who did this?"

193
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,660
Then he showed the things to everybody in the house.

194
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,060
Naturally everybody's fingerprints are on them,

195
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,660
and they aren't of any use.

196
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,360
Nobody can do anything about that.

197
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,160
Yes?

198
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,860
There's a lady who'd like to meet you.

199
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,960
What? What is she like?

200
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:48,560
She is as beautiful as the lawyer, Miss Kisaki there, madam.

201
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,260
What?

202
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,160
This time, she happens to be the real lover of...

203
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,760
No, Conan!

204
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,060
If you have no idea of the person,

205
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,960
may I ask her to leave this place, madam?

206
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,660
No, wait! I'll meet her.

207
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,460
She is in the hall, isn't she?

208
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,460
Mister, I see there are surveillance cameras here and there.

209
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,260
Yes, madam. After the incident,

210
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,860
for security reasons, we have set up those cameras.

211
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,160
I want to have more cameras installed,

212
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,760
but Mr. Fujieda says these will do because he is certain that

213
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,160
someone in the house is playing a prank on him.

214
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,860
And he also said that he does not want to waste money

215
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,360
on a house that is going to get ruined.

216
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,260
Ruined?

217
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,860
You sneaky thief!

218
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,860
What are you here for? Go home this minute!

219
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,860
I know it! You're Mikio's lover!

220
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,360
I know you are after the inheritance.

221
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,260
But you won't get anything at all from us!

222
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,560
I told you and I tell you, I'm not for it.

223
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,360
Huh?

224
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,260
It's Eri.

225
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,060
Yukiko!

226
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,360
Mom!

227
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,440
You and your elaborate make-up to hide your age,

228
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,940
but you just failed in trying, you old Teitan High Princess.

229
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,240
What you said more aptly applies to you,

230
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,440
you old ghoulish queen.

231
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,340
Wait and calm down, you two.

232
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,040
It's been a long time, Yuki!

233
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,340
Yes, yes. You been happy?

234
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,540
What?

235
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,240
It's been ten years now?

236
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,140
It was before you divorced Kogoro, Eri.

237
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,440
Not divorced yet, Yuki, just living separately.

238
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,340
We are still married in a way.

239
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,540
But it's been since the high school festival

240
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,740
that someone called me a princess.

241
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,540
Good old days.

242
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,940
That Miss Teitan High School contest

243
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,640
brought such enthusiasm with the Princess and Queen competition.

244
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,940
Miss Teitan High? Was there a contest then?

245
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,340
Well, I remember Sonoko told me something about it once.

246
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,640
Some 20 years ago,

247
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,940
there was a legendary queen contest that shook Teitan High School.

248
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:15,940
The contestant on one side was the Princess of Teitan High,

249
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:21,340
whose lovely look and acting power of a genius helped her debut.

250
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,440
And the contestant on the other side was

251
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,340
with a gifted mind and who got perfect on the Todai entrance exams.

252
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,740
At the age of 16, she was recommended to study abroad at Harvard.

253
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,940
Gifted with both beauty and intelligence, the Queen of Teitan High.

254
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,740
But I never thought that the two were our moms.

255
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,140
And which one was the winner?

256
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,940
Both of them were well known

257
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,540
and their fans all over the country came to see them.

258
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,840
The commotion ended up in the competition being suspended.

259
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,140
I see.

260
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,740
That's why there's no festival competition in Teitan High since then.

261
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,840
And, who on earth is she?

262
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,140
Huh?

263
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,140
She seems to be an acquaintance of Miss Kisaki,

264
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,940
but I am very embarrassed as the wife of Mikio

265
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,040
if she is his lover.

266
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,140
Are you?

267
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,540
No, I am not!

268
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,040
Yusaku asked me to...

269
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,940
Excuse me, but aren't you Yukiko?

270
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,940
Yes, I am.

271
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:22,140
I am Shigeru Fujieda. I asked Yusaku to solve the case

272
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,840
and figure out the mystery.

273
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,340
He said he is very busy as he is engaged in a certain job right now.

274
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,240
So he said he would send his wife in his place.

275
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,740
I did not expect such a beauty.

276
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,440
Don't you know her?

277
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,540
She was the star of the silver screen, Yukiko Fujimine.

278
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,540
Excuse me for not recognizing her.

279
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,940
I am not familiar with that part of the world.

280
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,140
Yusaku and I met at a party of mystery writers.

281
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,540
I talked to him the other day about when we happened to be in L.A.

282
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,240
and asked him for help for what has been happened here.

283
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,740
Then, do you write mysteries, too?

284
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:02,340
Yes, I do. But I have no bestsellers as he does yet.

285
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,740
Besides, since I lost my sister,

286
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,040
I am just a freeloader in this house.

287
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,440
Unlike the newlywed Mrs. Fujieda who hired Detective Mouri

288
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,740
for a fee of 10 million yen to protect her husband's life,

289
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,040
in my case, I asked him to do the job for free.

290
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,240
10 million yen?

291
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,140
Does Kogoro ask for such a preposterous fee?

292
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,240
If all he did was just ask, I'd be as happy as a lark.

293
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,640
What? You don't say!

294
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,040
He's spent 8 million yen already?

295
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,340
That's why I'm here, on his behalf.

296
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,640
And, where is he now?

297
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,640
In the office, drunk and lying on the couch.

298
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,940
He can't get up even if he wants to.

299
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,940
What? What's this?

300
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,140
Hey! Come on!

301
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,440
Hey!

302
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,540
Ran! Where are you?

303
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,240
Hey!

304
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,340
I see.

305
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,540
These show that it's not just a joke.

306
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,440
But the evidences are only those three items.

307
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,740
It would be a miracle if you can close in on the culprit with them.

308
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,840
But we have him with us,

309
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,640
so the miracle could happen.

310
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,740
That reminds me.

311
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,940
You were with Conan in the last case, weren't you?

312
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,140
That's true.

313
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,340
He solved one mystery after another so quickly.

314
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,240
It's just what I would expect of my...

315
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,140
Of your?

316
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,340
Of my...

317
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,240
Grandpa's brother's daughter's cousin's uncle's grandson.

318
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,940
A sort of, you know.

319
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,840
Oh, he is, I see.

320
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,140
Anyway, first we need to meet Mr. Mikio Fujieda

321
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,340
and ask if he can think of anything

322
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,740
that may have caused someone to want to go after his life,

323
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,740
and we'll start investigation from there.

324
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,540
That will not be possible, I should say.

325
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,240
Right now, Mr. Fujieda is reading a book

326
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,740
in the audio room while listening to classical music.

327
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,840
Please allow one to two hours before entering the room.

328
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,040
He will really get angry if interrupted while reading.

329
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,340
Is that so?

330
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,240
How can he be so unconcerned

331
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,840
when his life may be in danger?

332
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,640
But, is he safe being left alone?

333
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,940
Do you care to look inside the room?

334
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,640
We can watch it through the surveillance camera installed in the room.

335
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,840
For a facility that was hastily built, it's great!

336
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,040
I see they are still not sufficient enough, madam.

337
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,840
I understand. This place is so large

338
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,040
that it's not easy to take care of completely.

339
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,040
So this is the audio room,

340
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,340
and this is the surveillance room.

341
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,640
If something happens, you'll have to take time coming up here.

342
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,040
Who's on duty to monitor the room?

343
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,540
Myself and the house maids take turns.

344
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,840
Wait a minute.

345
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,540
There's somebody in the garden!

346
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,440
-What? -Over here.

347
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,940
A man wearing a knit cap.

348
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,440
He is Doi, the gardener, madam.

349
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,440
But what is he doing at this late hour?

350
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,840
He is working with more care than usual.

351
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,740
Tomorrow is the birthday of my late sister.

352
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,740
Well, I have to go and finish up the manuscript.

353
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,040
Ueki, take care of everyone while I'm not available.

354
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,540
Yes, sir.

355
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,640
I really want to stay longer with the beautiful ladies,

356
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,940
so it is regrettable.

357
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,640
It really is regrettable.

358
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,540
-Huh? -Regret what?

359
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:45,040
Because you two competed against each other for Miss Teitan, didn't you?

360
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,140
It is regrettable that the competition was suspended

361
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,940
before they got the final result.

362
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,540
-Oh, that. -But they did get the final result.

363
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,240
Each of us got exactly 10,000 ballots, it was a tie.

364
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,340
But the strange thing was that,

365
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,240
the number of ballot s prepared was 20,001 ballots,

366
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,440
so it shouldn't have turned out a tie.

367
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,740
They were one ballot short.

368
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,740
There was a great commotion over the missing ballot.

369
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,640
That's why the commendation ceremony was suspended, wasn't it?

370
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,240
Talk about nonsense.

371
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,940
But if you got that one ballot, Yuki, you would've won.

372
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,540
Of course not. I couldn't win over you.

373
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:24,140
Say. Did the ballot bear a golden color seal on it?

374
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,640
What? Yes, it did.

375
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,140
The seal of Teitan High on it.

376
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,640
Then I found a ballot in dad's uniform pocket of Teitan High School.

377
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,340
What?

378
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,140
I found it when I was trying to dispose of old clothes.

379
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,940
So now I know. That was the ballot for the contest.

380
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,940
Which? Which name was on it?

381
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,840
Was it Eri? Or me? Which?

382
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,340
But dad seemed to have washed the suits with the paper in it,

383
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,540
and the paper was torn into pieces.

384
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,140
Really?

385
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,140
Be honest and tell the truth, Ran.

386
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:00,740
Ran, you don't have to worry about your mom.

387
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,740
No. I mean, honest.

388
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,940
Well, you can always ask him for sure.

389
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,040
His hands!

390
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,140
The master is holding up his hands!

391
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,840
What does that mean?

392
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,640
Somebody came into the room and pointed a gun?

393
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,040
That can't be.

394
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,540
When I brought him coffee

395
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,340
and came out of the room just a while ago,

396
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,340
I'm sure the door was locked from inside.

397
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,440
It can't be! He was shot!

398
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,740
He'd been shot!

399
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,340
Where is the spare key to the room?

400
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,340
It's in my room, madam.

401
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,440
Go and get it quick!

402
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,740
Then, I will call the police.

403
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,240
And an ambulance, too.

404
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,240
Hurry and call them.

405
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,740
What's the matter here?

406
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,340
Hey, Mikio!

407
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,440
Are you all right, Mikio?

408
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,140
We are in a pickle.

409
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,940
But did Mikio really go down?

410
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,440
Yes, he did after he held up his hands.

411
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,640
Gun... gun shots?

412
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
Gosh!

413
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,040
-Would you do it, Ran? -Sure.

414
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,640
Do what?

415
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,240
Here is the key, madam.

416
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,140
Master!

417
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,440
Master!

418
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,640
The worst has happened.

419
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,840
It did.

420
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,040
Next Conan's Hint:

421
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,020
"Bookmark"

422
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,620
Next episode! Pops is in danger.

423
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,540
-Which is it! -It's come! (I've been shot!)

424
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,440
I haven't shot the needle in you yet, Pops.
