1
00:00:22,563 --> 00:00:24,163
The stage today is Teitan High School.

2
00:00:24,163 --> 00:00:25,863
Stories that may also be heard in your school.

3
00:00:25,863 --> 00:00:27,763
How many mysterious stories will there be in this episode?

4
00:00:27,763 --> 00:00:29,363
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,063
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:31,063 --> 00:00:33,063
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:41,142
Nightmare.

8
00:02:41,142 --> 00:02:44,642
"Mouri Detective Agency"

9
00:02:44,642 --> 00:02:46,242
What?

10
00:02:46,242 --> 00:02:48,442
The ghost scare at school?

11
00:02:48,442 --> 00:02:51,742
Right! I feel really eerie

12
00:02:51,742 --> 00:02:54,942
because there's been a lot of ghost scare in school recently.

13
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:57,442
Moreover, they say that people always see that apparition

14
00:02:57,442 --> 00:02:59,442
early in the morning.

15
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:00,842
Rumor has it that 2 years ago,

16
00:03:00,842 --> 00:03:03,242
a student who used to come to school early in the morning

17
00:03:03,242 --> 00:03:04,942
died in an accident,

18
00:03:04,942 --> 00:03:07,942
and they say it's the curse of that student.

19
00:03:07,942 --> 00:03:11,442
2 years ago is before I enrolled.

20
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:13,642
So please, dad!

21
00:03:13,642 --> 00:03:16,642
Come to school at check things out after school today, okay?

22
00:03:16,642 --> 00:03:19,042
To confirm whether it's really the doings of a ghost or not.

23
00:03:19,042 --> 00:03:21,042
Let it be.

24
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:22,542
It's probably just someone playing a prank

25
00:03:22,542 --> 00:03:24,442
or some natural phenomenon.

26
00:03:24,442 --> 00:03:27,842
Besides, if that ghost appears at school early in the morning,

27
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:30,042
it doesn't appear during class hours, does it?

28
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:31,342
I guess, but...

29
00:03:32,242 --> 00:03:34,642
As the daughter of renown Detective Kogoro Mouri,

30
00:03:34,642 --> 00:03:35,742
I will not let such unreasonable rumor

31
00:03:35,742 --> 00:03:38,442
of something that doesn't even exist run free!

32
00:03:38,442 --> 00:03:42,342
You said you were going to be monitor next week, right, Ran?

33
00:03:42,342 --> 00:03:43,742
What?

34
00:03:43,742 --> 00:03:44,942
Yes.

35
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:47,942
I see. You're afraid of going to school early in the morning,

36
00:03:47,942 --> 00:03:49,442
so you want me to go check?

37
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:52,642
I can't help it because I don't like ghosts.

38
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:55,242
Get rid of it with your karate!

39
00:03:55,242 --> 00:03:58,042
What makes you think that Karate is going to have any effect on ghosts?

40
00:03:58,042 --> 00:03:59,542
Ran.

41
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:01,742
Do you want me to go with you?

42
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,942
I may come up with a hint to at least solve the mystery.

43
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:12,242
"Teitan High School Ghost Story (Part 1)"

44
00:04:14,442 --> 00:04:16,042
Conan!

45
00:04:16,042 --> 00:04:17,742
Over here!

46
00:04:17,742 --> 00:04:20,342
Sorry to keep you waiting, Ran.

47
00:04:20,342 --> 00:04:21,942
Hey, Ran.

48
00:04:21,942 --> 00:04:23,542
Don't tell me that this glasses kid

49
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:26,042
is the help you called for the ghost scare?

50
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:29,442
But Dad won't come,

51
00:04:29,442 --> 00:04:33,042
saying that a renowned detective can't come to check out such a crazy case.

52
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:35,842
Well, he may not suffice as an aide.

53
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:40,042
but he can at least serve as me, the deduction queen's, assistant.

54
00:04:41,142 --> 00:04:43,742
You're the last person I'd like to hear that comment from.

55
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,842
This is the shoe box area.

56
00:04:45,842 --> 00:04:48,642
It's a little larger than the one in your school, isn't it?

57
00:04:48,642 --> 00:04:49,842
Yes.

58
00:04:49,842 --> 00:04:53,842
I know. I've been coming to this school for about a year.

59
00:04:53,842 --> 00:04:56,642
I'll put your shoes in my shoe slot, Conan.

60
00:04:56,642 --> 00:04:59,142
Thank you, Ran.

61
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,942
What's with that boy, Ran?

62
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:05,942
Is he the much rumored about Conan?

63
00:05:05,942 --> 00:05:07,542
Yes. Cute, isn't he?

64
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:10,642
Oh, no! It's blabber mouths Tashiro and Hidaka.

65
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:11,842
You can say that again!

66
00:05:11,842 --> 00:05:15,542
He looks like a miniature Kudo and sure looks cheeky.

67
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:19,042
Sonny, don't grow up to be a deduction freak, okay?

68
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:20,442
None of your business.

69
00:05:20,442 --> 00:05:22,342
Why'd you bring him here?

70
00:05:22,342 --> 00:05:24,042
An assistant for investigation.

71
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:27,342
This glasses kid is pretty sharp, you know?

72
00:05:27,342 --> 00:05:30,042
Investigation? You mean that ghost scare?

73
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:31,242
No kidding.

74
00:05:31,242 --> 00:05:33,642
Aizawa and Nakamichi of the soccer club.

75
00:05:33,642 --> 00:05:35,442
Don't bother.

76
00:05:35,442 --> 00:05:37,642
You're going to be cursed.

77
00:05:37,642 --> 00:05:40,142
Hey, will you stop saying things like that?

78
00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:43,242
By the way, how'd your re-test go?

79
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,342
Just made it!

80
00:05:44,342 --> 00:05:46,142
Although we were seriously on the brink.

81
00:05:46,142 --> 00:05:47,342
True, very true.

82
00:05:47,342 --> 00:05:51,242
I'm sure that one day, you'll run out of bad luck, too.

83
00:05:51,242 --> 00:05:53,142
See you then, but take it easy.

84
00:05:53,142 --> 00:05:55,842
If you find out who the ghost is, let me in on it.

85
00:05:55,842 --> 00:05:58,442
-Okay. -Sure thing!

86
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,242
Is something the matter, Conan?

87
00:06:00,242 --> 00:06:02,842
Nope, it's nothing.

88
00:06:03,842 --> 00:06:07,942
Right. If things were the way they were supposed to be,

89
00:06:07,942 --> 00:06:09,842
I would be coming to this school, studying,

90
00:06:09,842 --> 00:06:12,342
talking of trivial things with my friends,

91
00:06:12,342 --> 00:06:15,842
and leading a normal high school life.

92
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,542
Gin and Vodka...

93
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:20,842
If those men in black didn't force me to drink that strange drug,

94
00:06:20,842 --> 00:06:22,942
and if I hadn't shrunk...

95
00:06:25,142 --> 00:06:27,242
That woman Vermouth...

96
00:06:27,242 --> 00:06:29,942
one of them that disguised herself as Dr. Araide,

97
00:06:29,942 --> 00:06:32,942
got away from me just as I was about to corner her,

98
00:06:32,942 --> 00:06:35,842
in order to get my body back to normal again

99
00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:38,342
and regain my life as Shinichi Kudo.

100
00:06:38,342 --> 00:06:42,342
That woman is probably an assassin who was sent out

101
00:06:42,342 --> 00:06:44,842
to kill Ai who had betrayed the organization.

102
00:06:44,842 --> 00:06:46,142
I remember her saying back then,

103
00:06:46,142 --> 00:06:48,942
that she would give up on going after Ai.

104
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:51,242
I wonder if I can really believe what she said?

105
00:06:51,242 --> 00:06:54,042
After all, she's a witch that has a thousand faces.

106
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:57,042
She's as good as Thief Kid when it comes to disguising herself.

107
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,942
She may still be around us disguised as somebody

108
00:07:00,942 --> 00:07:02,642
and scheming to do something.

109
00:07:09,842 --> 00:07:11,942
What?

110
00:07:11,942 --> 00:07:13,042
Dr. Araide.

111
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:15,342
I heard that since the trial is over,

112
00:07:15,342 --> 00:07:18,142
you returned to your hospital in Aomori.

113
00:07:18,142 --> 00:07:22,042
No. I was planning on doing so, but decided against it.

114
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,442
I'm worried about my patients too, so...

115
00:07:24,442 --> 00:07:26,842
And it's not that easy saying goodbye to you all either.

116
00:07:26,842 --> 00:07:29,442
Then, you're going to remain being our school doctor?

117
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:33,042
Yes. I came today to tell the school of my intention.

118
00:07:35,842 --> 00:07:36,942
The real doctor?

119
00:07:36,942 --> 00:07:39,442
Hey! Conan!

120
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:41,142
Just what do you think you're doing?

121
00:07:41,142 --> 00:07:43,242
Are you all right, doctor?

122
00:07:43,242 --> 00:07:46,342
Yes, it's nothing.

123
00:07:46,342 --> 00:07:49,842
The FBI agent called Jodie told me all about what happened.

124
00:07:49,842 --> 00:07:50,842
Huh?

125
00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:52,942
She told me that a bad person disguised as me

126
00:07:52,942 --> 00:07:55,442
tried to do something bad.

127
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:58,042
She said she was sent back to the States for a while,

128
00:07:58,042 --> 00:08:00,542
but it seems that Hikaru or her grandmother who accompanied her

129
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:02,942
did not take to the States very well.

130
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:06,142
Then, I heard that the bad person revealed herself and fled.

131
00:08:06,142 --> 00:08:09,242
So, Jodie asked to return back here to Beikacho.

132
00:08:10,842 --> 00:08:13,142
But why are you telling me all this?

133
00:08:13,142 --> 00:08:17,142
I was told to tell only you because you'd surely be surprised.

134
00:08:17,142 --> 00:08:18,442
That's right!

135
00:08:18,442 --> 00:08:21,742
Let's have Dr. Araide help us with the ghost investigation, too.

136
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:22,942
That sounds great!

137
00:08:22,942 --> 00:08:25,342
What? Ghost investigation?

138
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:31,042
First, let's start here.

139
00:08:37,442 --> 00:08:39,742
The wailing storeroom of the gym.

140
00:08:40,442 --> 00:08:44,142
One rainy day, a girl student of the gymnastic club

141
00:08:44,142 --> 00:08:47,142
who came here early in the morning to prepare for morning practice

142
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:49,142
heard a wailing voice.

143
00:08:51,342 --> 00:08:53,642
The wailing leaked out of the storeroom

144
00:08:53,642 --> 00:08:55,542
where nobody was supposed to be.

145
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:59,342
The horrifying sound of someone wailing!

146
00:08:59,342 --> 00:09:01,042
And...

147
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,242
The girl student got scared and left,

148
00:09:05,242 --> 00:09:08,642
bringing other people of her club back to the place

149
00:09:08,642 --> 00:09:10,942
but the wailing had stopped.

150
00:09:13,242 --> 00:09:15,542
And the only thing left was this desk!

151
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:18,142
It was the desk of a boy student, Hideaki Hosaka,

152
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:21,742
who died mysteriously at this school 2 years ago!

153
00:09:23,442 --> 00:09:25,342
Talk about exaggeration.

154
00:09:25,342 --> 00:09:27,642
It so conspicuous that it would scare no one.

155
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:30,542
Hey, Ran.

156
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:33,242
That's no mystery or anything.

157
00:09:33,242 --> 00:09:36,742
He unfortunately tripped on the stairs,

158
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,342
"Kazumi Tsukamoto (18)" -and hit the wrong place. That's it.

159
00:09:39,342 --> 00:09:41,642
Don't go spreading strange rumors.

160
00:09:43,142 --> 00:09:44,642
Kazumi.

161
00:09:44,642 --> 00:09:47,642
Mouri, just what are you doing here?

162
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:49,842
The Karate club is off today, isn't it?

163
00:09:49,842 --> 00:09:53,242
A senior and the previous captain of the Karate club.

164
00:09:53,242 --> 00:09:55,442
I'm investigating the ghost case.

165
00:09:55,442 --> 00:09:57,842
You mean the wailing case?

166
00:09:57,842 --> 00:10:00,042
If it's that everyone's saying that,

167
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:02,342
-it was probably the trick of the wind. -What?

168
00:10:06,242 --> 00:10:08,442
See? That skylight with the broken lock.

169
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,342
It's said the when the wind blows in from there,

170
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:11,842
the sound of the howling of the wind

171
00:10:11,842 --> 00:10:13,842
was taken to be the sound of someone wailing.

172
00:10:15,042 --> 00:10:17,442
It's amazing that you figured out that

173
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:20,142
this desk was the boy student's desk.

174
00:10:20,142 --> 00:10:23,842
I told everyone about it because there was so much fuss over it.

175
00:10:23,842 --> 00:10:27,042
I was his classmate, besides.

176
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:29,142
Is that so?

177
00:10:31,342 --> 00:10:34,942
Why is his desk in a place like this, though?

178
00:10:39,442 --> 00:10:42,042
It started to rain.

179
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:44,642
No way. I don't have an umbrella.

180
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:45,842
Neither do I.

181
00:10:45,842 --> 00:10:47,942
Then, would you like to take shelter from the rain until it stops?

182
00:10:47,942 --> 00:10:49,042
What?

183
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:50,842
At the cursed library.

184
00:10:50,842 --> 00:10:53,842
I was just about to go there myself, too.

185
00:10:53,842 --> 00:10:57,042
-Shall we go there? -Of course.

186
00:10:57,042 --> 00:10:59,742
What's this? A signature?

187
00:11:04,142 --> 00:11:05,642
It's starting to rain cats and dogs.

188
00:11:05,642 --> 00:11:07,142
I wonder if it's going to stop.

189
00:11:07,142 --> 00:11:09,642
Don't worry. According to the weather forecast,

190
00:11:09,642 --> 00:11:11,442
this is supposed to be rain shower.

191
00:11:11,442 --> 00:11:14,942
Dr. Araide, you sure are a push-over like always

192
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:18,242
coming along to investigate a ghost scare by request of a student.

193
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:20,042
Well, yes.

194
00:11:22,942 --> 00:11:24,242
Huh?

195
00:11:24,242 --> 00:11:26,842
Seko.

196
00:11:26,842 --> 00:11:29,942
Where were you? I was looking for you.

197
00:11:29,942 --> 00:11:32,042
"Kunishige Seko (18)" -I had an upset stomach,

198
00:11:32,042 --> 00:11:35,942
so I cut the afternoon class and was resting in the infirmary.

199
00:11:35,942 --> 00:11:38,342
-Are you all right? -Yeah.

200
00:11:38,342 --> 00:11:41,642
Did you want anything? Tsukamoto.

201
00:11:41,642 --> 00:11:44,442
It's not anything important, so I guess I'll get to it some other time.

202
00:11:45,642 --> 00:11:49,542
Well, I guess I'll rest a while more than, before going home.

203
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,942
Before that worried teacher decides to lug me off to the hospital.

204
00:11:57,142 --> 00:11:58,642
"Infirmary"

205
00:11:59,242 --> 00:12:03,442
Was he also a classmate of the boy named Hosaka?

206
00:12:03,442 --> 00:12:05,542
No, he was in a different class.

207
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:08,142
But he seems to have been childhood friends with Hosaka.

208
00:12:10,742 --> 00:12:12,442
How unusual!

209
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:15,442
That an athletic person like you would be coming to the library.

210
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:19,042
How rude! I read books too, you know?

211
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:20,642
Besides, I have the entrance exam of university coming up next year.

212
00:12:20,642 --> 00:12:22,742
Besides, just like you two,

213
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,742
I'm also investigating the ghost scare.

214
00:12:26,142 --> 00:12:28,842
"Library"

215
00:12:28,842 --> 00:12:32,042
When you came this morning, the books were left out on the table?

216
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,042
Yes.

217
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:36,842
And all those books were ones that Hosaka had borrowed before.

218
00:12:36,842 --> 00:12:39,742
Moreover, this happened four consecutive days in a row, you know?

219
00:12:39,742 --> 00:12:40,742
No matter how you think of it,

220
00:12:40,742 --> 00:12:42,242
this is none other than the curse of Hosaka

221
00:12:42,242 --> 00:12:43,942
who couldn't read the book as much as he wanted to!

222
00:12:46,442 --> 00:12:47,542
Hey.

223
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:49,042
But if the books are not put away,

224
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:53,042
I think that the librarian would notice when locking the library.

225
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:55,742
It seems that the 4 books were found, one behind the bookshelf,

226
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:58,142
another under the desk and so on forth.

227
00:12:58,142 --> 00:13:00,342
I think it's somebody whose taking advantage

228
00:13:00,342 --> 00:13:03,542
of the ghost scare and playing pranks, though.

229
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:05,042
If I ever catch the brat that's doing this,

230
00:13:05,042 --> 00:13:08,242
I'm going to get him for sure and bust him up.

231
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:11,542
So, when the time comes, you help me too, okay, Mouri?

232
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:13,042
Okay.

233
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:17,142
Now, finally for these cursed stairs.

234
00:13:17,142 --> 00:13:19,842
When a student came to these stairs early in the morning,

235
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:22,742
the bottom of the stairs was soaked with water, right?

236
00:13:22,742 --> 00:13:26,942
Yes. It seems that these are the stairs that boy fell from, too.

237
00:13:26,942 --> 00:13:30,942
It's probably the cursed tears of the boy named Hosaka!

238
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:32,742
Maybe the window wasn't closed tight,

239
00:13:32,742 --> 00:13:35,842
and it rained the day before.

240
00:13:35,842 --> 00:13:37,242
I mean, we're not kids, you know?

241
00:13:37,242 --> 00:13:38,942
So the windows would've been closed.

242
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:40,642
Besides, that's not the only thing.

243
00:13:40,642 --> 00:13:42,542
It's rumored that the number of the steps of these stairs

244
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:44,342
are different each time you count them.

245
00:13:44,342 --> 00:13:46,742
Then, why don't both try counting them?

246
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,442
What?

247
00:13:48,442 --> 00:13:51,542
Okay, we'll show you!

248
00:13:53,342 --> 00:13:55,542
One, two...

249
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:58,942
Three, four, five...

250
00:13:58,942 --> 00:14:02,442
Six, seven, eight...

251
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,642
Nine, ten...

252
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:09,342
Ran, how many did you count?

253
00:14:09,342 --> 00:14:10,942
Twelve.

254
00:14:10,942 --> 00:14:13,042
What? I counted thirteen!

255
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:14,842
No kidding! Why?

256
00:14:14,842 --> 00:14:16,842
The correct answer is twelve steps.

257
00:14:16,842 --> 00:14:18,542
You probably counted one extra step

258
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:20,842
when you brought both you feet together

259
00:14:20,842 --> 00:14:23,542
and made it all the way up the steps.

260
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:25,842
That's because you keep thinking that this whole thing is scary.

261
00:14:25,842 --> 00:14:29,742
Okay. All I gotta do is count it over again, right?

262
00:14:29,742 --> 00:14:30,942
Rather, do you really have the intention

263
00:14:30,942 --> 00:14:33,142
of solving the mystery about this ghost scare or what?

264
00:14:34,742 --> 00:14:36,142
"Masao Monobe (18)" -Hey, you guys!

265
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:37,942
Will you cut out the noise?

266
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:39,842
I can't concentrate on drawing!

267
00:14:39,842 --> 00:14:41,542
I'm sorry.

268
00:14:42,242 --> 00:14:44,542
I'm sorry!

269
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:46,942
Huh? That student...

270
00:14:48,142 --> 00:14:49,842
It seems to have stopped raining.

271
00:14:49,842 --> 00:14:52,242
Well, shall we go home for today?

272
00:14:52,242 --> 00:14:53,842
I guess so.

273
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:55,342
After listening to you, Conan,

274
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:56,442
I'm starting to feel that no such thing exist,

275
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:58,442
and I feel a bit courageous now.

276
00:14:59,442 --> 00:15:01,742
Besides, it's getting kind of dark outside, too.

277
00:15:04,442 --> 00:15:06,642
What's that?

278
00:15:06,642 --> 00:15:08,042
What?

279
00:15:17,886 --> 00:15:19,286
That desk...

280
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:21,086
It can't be...

281
00:15:22,186 --> 00:15:23,786
the one we just saw, could it?

282
00:15:23,786 --> 00:15:24,986
Conan!

283
00:15:24,986 --> 00:15:26,586
There's something on top of the desk.

284
00:15:37,086 --> 00:15:40,386
My grudge has not yet vanished.

285
00:15:44,186 --> 00:15:46,286
Who could've played a prank like this?

286
00:15:46,286 --> 00:15:47,986
The paper's not wet,

287
00:15:47,986 --> 00:15:51,086
so it must've been put here after it stopped raining.

288
00:15:51,086 --> 00:15:52,886
If so, something's strange.

289
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:54,286
What?

290
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,386
The soil is muddy with rain.

291
00:15:56,386 --> 00:15:59,886
The thing that's supposed to be here is not here.

292
00:15:59,886 --> 00:16:03,486
The footprints of the one who brought the desk here.

293
00:16:06,086 --> 00:16:08,086
Just as I thought.

294
00:16:08,086 --> 00:16:10,086
The desk and the chair out there are the ones

295
00:16:10,086 --> 00:16:12,686
that were in the storeroom of the gym after all!

296
00:16:12,686 --> 00:16:15,586
Yes. There's no doubt that the desk is the one of the student

297
00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:19,886
called Hideaki Hosaka that died here at this high school.

298
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:22,586
Then, somebody put it out there to play a prank?

299
00:16:22,586 --> 00:16:26,086
Yes. There was a piece of paper on the desk,

300
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:28,086
which wasn't wet,

301
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:32,386
so it was probably put there after the rain stopped.

302
00:16:32,386 --> 00:16:34,886
But, then it's strange.

303
00:16:34,886 --> 00:16:37,686
The ground of the campus where it was, was muddy with rain,

304
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:40,886
but the only footprints left were Conan and mine's that got there

305
00:16:40,886 --> 00:16:42,886
when we ran over to the desk.

306
00:16:42,886 --> 00:16:44,186
It's a ghost!

307
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:48,286
I'm sure the ghost of that student called Hosaka took it there!

308
00:16:48,286 --> 00:16:49,986
It's possible.

309
00:16:49,986 --> 00:16:51,786
Because ghosts don't have legs.

310
00:16:51,786 --> 00:16:54,086
Come on, all of you...

311
00:16:54,086 --> 00:16:56,186
Hey.

312
00:16:56,186 --> 00:16:59,186
The desk and chair are gone!

313
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:01,186
No way! How can they?

314
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,986
Dr. Araide and I returned them to the storeroom of the gym.

315
00:17:04,986 --> 00:17:06,386
What?

316
00:17:06,386 --> 00:17:07,386
We didn't want to entertain

317
00:17:07,386 --> 00:17:09,286
the one who did it by making a big fuss over it.

318
00:17:09,286 --> 00:17:12,686
And besides, something strange was written on the paper on top the desk.

319
00:17:12,686 --> 00:17:14,986
Strange?

320
00:17:14,986 --> 00:17:18,286
It seems to have been written with a brush and was quite sloppy.

321
00:17:18,286 --> 00:17:21,186
My grudge has not yet vanished.

322
00:17:23,686 --> 00:17:26,486
Then, why wasn't that paper wet?

323
00:17:26,486 --> 00:17:29,286
Because the ghost was writing his grudge filled sentence

324
00:17:29,286 --> 00:17:31,486
with his body over the desk in the rain.

325
00:17:31,486 --> 00:17:33,386
You guys... I don't see how you can come up

326
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,686
with one idea after the other like that...

327
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:41,286
Is anything the matter?

328
00:17:45,286 --> 00:17:49,186
He... he held a grudge against me, after all.

329
00:17:49,186 --> 00:17:54,386
This ghost scare is his curse!

330
00:17:55,986 --> 00:17:59,586
By chance, do you happen to know this student called Hosaka?

331
00:18:00,586 --> 00:18:01,586
Yeah.

332
00:18:01,586 --> 00:18:04,286
He was a member of the art club with me.

333
00:18:04,286 --> 00:18:08,586
But he fell off those stairs back then two years ago.

334
00:18:08,586 --> 00:18:09,986
Back then...

335
00:18:09,986 --> 00:18:12,586
Don't tell me you were there when this happened?

336
00:18:14,286 --> 00:18:16,086
Just as I thought.

337
00:18:16,086 --> 00:18:18,486
Back then when the accident occurred, this student...

338
00:18:19,486 --> 00:18:22,186
-Please leave. -What?

339
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:25,686
The teacher was nice enough to let me use this art room all by myself

340
00:18:25,686 --> 00:18:29,386
so that I would be able to complete my piece for the contest.

341
00:18:29,386 --> 00:18:30,686
Go on, quickly!

342
00:18:30,686 --> 00:18:33,586
I don't want to waste any time!

343
00:18:33,586 --> 00:18:34,986
Okay.

344
00:18:45,386 --> 00:18:49,886
Should we let Kazumi know that the desk was out on campus, too?

345
00:18:49,886 --> 00:18:51,286
Okay.

346
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:55,386
Something's shining.

347
00:18:55,386 --> 00:18:56,886
What is it?

348
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:01,686
Wax?

349
00:19:01,686 --> 00:19:04,286
What's the matter, Conan?

350
00:19:04,286 --> 00:19:08,286
You said that the bottom of the stairs was soaked with water,

351
00:19:08,286 --> 00:19:09,986
but was it this floor that was leaking?

352
00:19:09,986 --> 00:19:14,286
Right! The entire floor!

353
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:18,886
The tears of the curse of the student named Hosaka that died here.

354
00:19:18,886 --> 00:19:21,286
Who found that?

355
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:23,686
I heard that it was someone from the art club

356
00:19:23,686 --> 00:19:25,186
that came here early in the morning.

357
00:19:27,486 --> 00:19:29,686
Hey, is that for real?

358
00:19:29,686 --> 00:19:33,786
Is it true that Hosaka's desk and chair were out on campus?

359
00:19:33,786 --> 00:19:36,486
Yes. And on the desk was a paper that said,

360
00:19:36,486 --> 00:19:40,186
"My grudge has not yet vanished."

361
00:19:40,186 --> 00:19:41,786
I'm really pissed!

362
00:19:41,786 --> 00:19:43,986
This is going too far as a prank!

363
00:19:43,986 --> 00:19:45,086
If you find the one who's doing this,

364
00:19:45,086 --> 00:19:47,686
make sure you grab him and bring him here no matter what!

365
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,386
We'll give him a good licking together!

366
00:19:49,386 --> 00:19:53,686
I think your spin kick will suffice, though.

367
00:19:53,686 --> 00:19:55,286
Hey.

368
00:19:55,286 --> 00:19:57,786
Do you know what kind of books were not put away

369
00:19:57,786 --> 00:20:02,286
and borrowed by Hosaka before?

370
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:03,386
Yes.

371
00:20:05,186 --> 00:20:08,586
They're all difficult books that you don't see around too often.

372
00:20:08,586 --> 00:20:10,586
It's not at all surprising.

373
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:13,586
See! Take a look at this library card!

374
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:16,186
These four books seems to have been borrowed virtually only

375
00:20:16,186 --> 00:20:17,486
by the student called Hosaka.

376
00:20:17,486 --> 00:20:19,986
Hosaka wanted to be a comic wirter.

377
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:21,586
He used to always say that in order to write an interesting story,

378
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:23,286
it was useful to keep in mind

379
00:20:23,286 --> 00:20:26,986
all kinds of things that people aren't familiar with.

380
00:20:26,986 --> 00:20:28,086
I see.

381
00:20:28,086 --> 00:20:31,286
You saw his signature on the edge of the desk, didn't you?

382
00:20:31,286 --> 00:20:33,986
That's the signature he told everyone

383
00:20:33,986 --> 00:20:37,486
that he was going to use in the future when he becomes famous.

384
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,186
Then, then...

385
00:20:39,186 --> 00:20:41,686
His dream was severed part way too,

386
00:20:41,686 --> 00:20:44,986
so he must've felt super attachment to it!

387
00:20:44,986 --> 00:20:47,586
He wet the bottom of the stairs with his tears of curse.

388
00:20:47,586 --> 00:20:49,786
At midnight, he re-read the books in the library

389
00:20:49,786 --> 00:20:50,986
with his heart full of hate.

390
00:20:50,986 --> 00:20:54,786
He finally brings his desk that is in the storeroom of the gym out

391
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,486
-into the campus grounds... -Hey, hold it, Sonoko!

392
00:20:57,486 --> 00:20:58,986
Ran.

393
00:20:58,986 --> 00:21:01,386
Enough with the drama.

394
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:04,286
Oh, right. If we ask the principal,

395
00:21:04,286 --> 00:21:07,686
he may know something about it.

396
00:21:07,686 --> 00:21:11,686
After you left the library, I got up to go to the restroom

397
00:21:11,686 --> 00:21:14,886
and saw a glimpse of him through the window on the 3rd floor.

398
00:21:14,886 --> 00:21:18,686
Like always, he was standing in place on campus.

399
00:21:21,586 --> 00:21:25,886
The principal was thinking of what tree to plant there?

400
00:21:25,886 --> 00:21:28,786
Yes. He'd go out there everyday,

401
00:21:28,786 --> 00:21:30,986
trying to decide what to plant.

402
00:21:30,986 --> 00:21:33,886
So, the principal is still undecided.

403
00:21:33,886 --> 00:21:36,186
I remember that the principal said that

404
00:21:36,186 --> 00:21:39,486
he discussed it with you, too, Dr. Araide.

405
00:21:39,486 --> 00:21:40,586
What?

406
00:21:40,586 --> 00:21:42,686
Yeah, right. That's right.

407
00:21:42,686 --> 00:21:45,186
Well, it's only natural that he wouldn't know about it.

408
00:21:45,186 --> 00:21:48,486
Because Vermouth was the one disguised as Araide

409
00:21:48,486 --> 00:21:51,486
as soon as he became the school doctor of Teitan High School.

410
00:21:51,486 --> 00:21:54,286
Come to think of it, Vermouth disguised as Dr. Araide

411
00:21:54,286 --> 00:21:57,486
was also in charge of Teitan Elementary School.

412
00:21:57,486 --> 00:21:59,686
An 18 year-old just like you.

413
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,686
If Ai, who betrayed the organization

414
00:22:02,686 --> 00:22:04,986
is really between the age of 18 and 20,

415
00:22:04,986 --> 00:22:08,486
and if their looking for her in one of the high schools here,

416
00:22:08,486 --> 00:22:11,086
looking into high schools and universities should suffice.

417
00:22:11,086 --> 00:22:12,486
If they were thinking that

418
00:22:12,486 --> 00:22:15,886
Ai had shrunk and become a child like me to begin with,

419
00:22:15,886 --> 00:22:17,086
why couldn't they find her

420
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:20,486
as soon as Dr. Araide became the school doctor?

421
00:22:20,486 --> 00:22:24,486
There is nothing like a new student who catches the eye.

422
00:22:24,486 --> 00:22:27,086
So, why didn't it?

423
00:22:27,086 --> 00:22:30,086
Gosh! It sure bothers me!

424
00:22:30,086 --> 00:22:31,686
Thanks to the ghost scare,

425
00:22:31,686 --> 00:22:33,786
I've come up with other things that I've got to work on.

426
00:24:31,813 --> 00:24:34,513
Next Conan's Hint:

427
00:24:34,513 --> 00:24:36,313
"Umbrella"

428
00:24:36,313 --> 00:24:37,713
The wailing storeroom.

429
00:24:37,713 --> 00:24:38,813
The library filled with grudge.

430
00:24:38,813 --> 00:24:40,813
The cursed stairs.
