1
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:04,280
And, how was it?

2
00:00:04,285 --> 00:00:05,980
Did you find out about the old man

3
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:07,980
who used to know Eisuke Hondo as a child?

4
00:00:07,985 --> 00:00:10,480
You got to talk to his grandson, didn't you?

5
00:00:10,485 --> 00:00:12,980
-Yeah. -What do you mean, "Yeah..."

6
00:00:12,985 --> 00:00:14,780
Tell me about it.

7
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:16,980
I'm a bit concerned too, you know.

8
00:00:16,985 --> 00:00:19,999
I got to meet the grandson of the man who said he knew the man

9
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:21,380
and his friend.

10
00:00:21,385 --> 00:00:23,480
They gave me a lot of information

11
00:00:23,485 --> 00:00:25,080
and a picture.

12
00:00:25,085 --> 00:00:26,005
A picture?

13
00:00:26,185 --> 00:00:28,880
Oh, of Eisuke Hondo when he was a child,

14
00:00:28,885 --> 00:00:33,480
a man behind him that's supposed to be his father.

15
00:00:33,485 --> 00:00:35,580
Wow, you did it, Kudo!

16
00:00:35,585 --> 00:00:38,580
And? Do you remember seeing that man somewhere?

17
00:00:38,585 --> 00:00:40,780
No, I don't.

18
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:46,780
According to his grandson's friend, he seems to have said,

19
00:00:46,785 --> 00:00:48,380
"The time has come to dive."

20
00:00:48,385 --> 00:00:49,480
"Dive?"

21
00:00:49,485 --> 00:00:51,680
And the man's friends seem to have said things like,

22
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:56,480
"Give it your best shot." Or, "Take care."

23
00:00:56,485 --> 00:00:58,037
When you say "dive",

24
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:01,080
it usually means going underwater or into the sea, right?

25
00:01:01,085 --> 00:01:03,380
Yeah, since the friend of the grandson

26
00:01:03,385 --> 00:01:06,045
was told that the man was an office worker,

27
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:09,180
he thought that man was going diving or something.

28
00:01:09,185 --> 00:01:11,580
But more correctly,

29
00:01:11,585 --> 00:01:13,680
that man was just any other office worker

30
00:01:13,685 --> 00:01:16,480
who was hired by "the Company."

31
00:01:16,485 --> 00:01:18,880
The company?

32
00:01:18,885 --> 00:01:21,080
Kudo, don't tell me that's...

33
00:01:21,085 --> 00:01:22,980
Yeah, I don't know if that "Company"

34
00:01:22,985 --> 00:01:24,680
is what we think it is

35
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:27,080
or just any other company.

36
00:01:27,085 --> 00:01:28,480
But, the man told me that the old man

37
00:01:28,485 --> 00:01:30,069
really got along with that man,

38
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:32,071
and that they used to have deep conversation with each other.

39
00:01:32,285 --> 00:01:35,680
Taking into consideration that he was an unmatched suspense fan,

40
00:01:35,685 --> 00:01:37,180
he figured from the way he talked

41
00:01:37,185 --> 00:01:40,079
or characteristic way of saying things...

42
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,580
So he may be a member of "the Company"

43
00:01:43,585 --> 00:01:46,080
that we're thinking of.

44
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:47,780
Yeah.

45
00:01:48,285 --> 00:01:49,680
But, Kudo,

46
00:01:49,685 --> 00:01:52,880
if it turns out to be true, it's big trouble.

47
00:01:52,885 --> 00:01:54,093
I think it's best to watch how things go

48
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:56,095
without doing anything for now.

49
00:01:56,285 --> 00:01:58,980
What would you do?

50
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:00,580
If you were in my position?

51
00:02:00,585 --> 00:02:03,580
Well, if it were me, I'd just go for it.

52
00:02:03,585 --> 00:02:06,105
I mean, no, I would...

53
00:02:06,105 --> 00:02:09,080
I'd do exactly what you would.

54
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:12,780
I'll pry as deep as I can into it.

55
00:02:12,785 --> 00:02:18,117
Until the curiosity within me dries out.

56
00:02:18,117 --> 00:02:21,480
Hey, Conan, just how long are you going to stay locked in there.

57
00:02:21,485 --> 00:02:22,480
I'm leaving without you!

58
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:25,180
Oh, sorry, I'll be right out.

59
00:02:25,185 --> 00:02:27,580
Hey, don't tell me you're talking about something important like this

60
00:02:27,585 --> 00:02:29,780
in the restroom?

61
00:02:29,785 --> 00:02:32,131
I wonder if he has a stomachache or something.

62
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:34,133
Ran! Let's just leave that brat behind

63
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:35,380
and go to the hospital.

64
00:02:35,385 --> 00:02:38,680
After all, we're going to visit our intermediate school days classmate.

65
00:02:38,685 --> 00:02:41,280
But, you haven't eaten lunch yet either, have you, Sonoko?

66
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:43,180
So, I thought that we could drop by and have lunch

67
00:02:43,185 --> 00:02:45,080
after visiting the hospital.

68
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:47,180
Because dad is at the horse races

69
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:49,880
and Conan would have to stay home alone so...

70
00:02:49,885 --> 00:02:52,151
Sorry, Hattori. I'll call you if I find out anything more.

71
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:55,680
Hey, hold it.

72
00:02:58,885 --> 00:03:00,580
Be careful.

73
00:03:00,585 --> 00:03:02,480
Kudo.

74
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:16,580
Sizzling hot suspense.

75
00:03:16,585 --> 00:03:19,080
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

76
00:03:19,085 --> 00:03:20,880
Intertwined in the mystery of the Black Organization

77
00:03:20,885 --> 00:03:21,880
are Eisuke Hondo and Rena Mizunashi.

78
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:24,680
The curtains of the new series are ready to unfold!

79
00:03:24,685 --> 00:03:26,180
He sees through the one and only truth.

80
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:27,780
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

81
00:03:27,785 --> 00:03:30,780
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

82
00:04:58,707 --> 00:05:03,900
"Red and Black Crash: Prologue"

83
00:05:03,907 --> 00:05:06,000
"West Beika Hospital"

84
00:05:06,007 --> 00:05:09,200
Bye. See you!

85
00:05:10,307 --> 00:05:12,700
I tell you, that Aya.

86
00:05:12,707 --> 00:05:14,800
I mean we rush over super worried because we heard that

87
00:05:14,807 --> 00:05:17,200
her appendicitis was on the verge of bursting.

88
00:05:17,207 --> 00:05:18,300
Yet she turns out looking just great

89
00:05:18,307 --> 00:05:22,100
saying that she wants to fill her stomach with cake and parfait!

90
00:05:22,107 --> 00:05:25,600
All for the better, since she seems to be doing great.

91
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:29,200
Oh, no. Talking about food made my stomach growl.

92
00:05:29,207 --> 00:05:31,000
Let's go eat right now then!

93
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:35,200
The burger shop that opened near here is pretty popular!

94
00:05:35,207 --> 00:05:36,700
Of course they also have

95
00:05:36,707 --> 00:05:40,319
the "children's set" that Conan loves too.

96
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,321
It's the plate that comes with the toy.

97
00:05:42,507 --> 00:05:45,100
Then shall we invite him over to come too?

98
00:05:45,107 --> 00:05:46,325
Him?

99
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:47,900
That klutz!

100
00:05:47,907 --> 00:05:49,900
Oh, Eisuke!

101
00:05:49,907 --> 00:05:51,700
Him!

102
00:05:51,707 --> 00:05:54,600
Oh, Ms. Mouri and Ms. Suzuki!

103
00:05:58,337 --> 00:05:59,700
I'm sorry.

104
00:05:59,707 --> 00:06:01,600
Hey, are you all right?

105
00:06:01,607 --> 00:06:03,400
Yes, somehow...

106
00:06:03,407 --> 00:06:06,100
What brings you all here?

107
00:06:06,107 --> 00:06:08,100
We went to visit a friend at the hospital.

108
00:06:08,107 --> 00:06:11,200
Don't tell me that he's come here because

109
00:06:11,207 --> 00:06:15,000
he's aware Rena Mizunashi is hospitalized somewhere?

110
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:21,900
Isn't this Rena Mizunashi?

111
00:06:21,907 --> 00:06:24,700
You know, the popular announcer that's on leave now?

112
00:06:24,707 --> 00:06:25,700
You're right.

113
00:06:25,707 --> 00:06:27,700
She looks much younger than now, though...

114
00:06:27,707 --> 00:06:29,700
Oh, no,

115
00:06:29,707 --> 00:06:30,800
she's my older sister!

116
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,371
Huh? Older sister?

117
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:34,700
Not! You mean that announcer!

118
00:06:34,707 --> 00:06:37,700
No, although they look alike, they're not the same person.

119
00:06:37,707 --> 00:06:39,400
Their name's are different to

120
00:06:39,407 --> 00:06:42,381
and besides, my sister left home ten years ago.

121
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:43,600
She left home?

122
00:06:43,607 --> 00:06:45,800
That's why I'm carrying this picture around

123
00:06:45,807 --> 00:06:47,300
and looking for her.

124
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:50,389
But, why are you looking around hospitals?

125
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:51,800
Sis used to always say that

126
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:54,400
she wanted to be a nurse in the future.

127
00:06:54,407 --> 00:06:56,100
Besides, the hospital

128
00:06:56,107 --> 00:06:58,800
is the place where my sister saved me many times.

129
00:06:58,807 --> 00:07:01,600
I kind of feel that she's somewhere near hospitals.

130
00:07:01,607 --> 00:07:04,400
She saved you?

131
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:07,000
I was a klutz since I was a child, and not only that,

132
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,700
but also sickly,

133
00:07:08,707 --> 00:07:11,700
so sis used to take me to the hospital all the time.

134
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:13,700
If I got hurt and bled, she would say,

135
00:07:13,707 --> 00:07:17,600
"You've got to take good care, because God blessed with blood"

136
00:07:17,607 --> 00:07:20,000
"that you can share with everybody else."

137
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:21,700
But, on the contrary, it turned out that

138
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:24,800
sis was the one who shared her blood with me.

139
00:07:24,807 --> 00:07:29,100
A little before sis disappeared, I was badly wounded...

140
00:07:35,507 --> 00:07:40,000
and I got a huge amount of blood transfusion from her.

141
00:07:40,007 --> 00:07:42,700
The blood flowing through my body

142
00:07:42,707 --> 00:07:44,443
is my sister's.

143
00:07:44,607 --> 00:07:50,100
I felt my sister's kindness each time my heart throbbed.

144
00:07:50,107 --> 00:07:52,451
However, when I was discharged from the hospital,

145
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:54,100
my sister was gone.

146
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,800
Maybe she thought that if she stuck around any longer,

147
00:07:56,807 --> 00:07:59,300
she would've had to give you all her blood.

148
00:07:59,307 --> 00:08:01,100
Hey, Sonoko!

149
00:08:01,107 --> 00:08:03,900
I have no idea why sis disappeared,

150
00:08:03,907 --> 00:08:05,000
but I want to see her one more time

151
00:08:05,007 --> 00:08:07,600
and tell her thank you from the bottom of my heart.

152
00:08:07,607 --> 00:08:11,200
After all, I'm alive now thanks to her.

153
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:15,400
A blood type that can be given to anyone.

154
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:19,700
What he just said doesn't sound like a lie.

155
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,600
I guess it wouldn't be wrong to say

156
00:08:21,607 --> 00:08:24,800
he's looking for his older sister.

157
00:08:24,807 --> 00:08:28,100
That's just like us.

158
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:33,100
Remember, some time back I gave you a lot of my blood too.

159
00:08:33,107 --> 00:08:35,700
Can you feel my kindness too?

160
00:08:35,707 --> 00:08:38,497
Yep. Sure thing...

161
00:08:38,497 --> 00:08:42,000
But, isn't there a chance that Rena Mizunashi

162
00:08:42,007 --> 00:08:44,200
and your older sister are one and the same?

163
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:45,800
I don't think that's possible.

164
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:47,000
Why not?

165
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:50,509
If she's on TV, she may not be using her real name?

166
00:08:50,707 --> 00:08:52,300
Well, yes, but...

167
00:08:52,307 --> 00:08:53,800
Why don't we do this then?

168
00:08:53,807 --> 00:08:57,700
One of dad's friends is a great fan of Rena Mizunashi,

169
00:08:57,707 --> 00:09:01,000
and seems to have video taped her a lot.

170
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,900
So, let's ask him to show them to us!

171
00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:04,900
If you take a good look at her, it may turn out that

172
00:09:04,907 --> 00:09:06,000
she's your older sister, right?

173
00:09:06,007 --> 00:09:07,300
I guess so.

174
00:09:07,307 --> 00:09:09,100
It's okay with me.

175
00:09:09,107 --> 00:09:11,900
Right, why don't we show that picture to him too?

176
00:09:11,907 --> 00:09:14,533
We may be able to find out if it's Rena Mizunashi.

177
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:16,535
Okay.

178
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,539
Yes, at any rate, let's head off.

179
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:23,300
Before starting off, let's have lunch!

180
00:09:23,307 --> 00:09:24,543
Let's go.

181
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:27,300
I'm really craving hamburger right now.

182
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:38,000
Yes, hello.

183
00:09:38,007 --> 00:09:40,559
Oh, long time no talk. This is Ran Mouri speaking.

184
00:09:40,807 --> 00:09:42,561
Do you remember me?

185
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:44,300
He has a dog.

186
00:09:44,307 --> 00:09:47,000
My name is Mouri.

187
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,700
Excuse me, is this Mr. Anno's residence?

188
00:09:49,707 --> 00:09:52,100
No, it isn't!

189
00:09:52,107 --> 00:09:54,573
Oh no, I called the wrong number.

190
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:56,200
Cool it.

191
00:09:56,207 --> 00:09:58,900
But if Eisuke's older sister

192
00:09:58,907 --> 00:10:00,600
is really Rena Mizunashi, that announcer,

193
00:10:00,607 --> 00:10:03,100
it's big news, you know.

194
00:10:05,107 --> 00:10:07,700
Oh, long time no talk, this is Ran Mouri.

195
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:08,900
You again.

196
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:11,600
I'm telling you've got the wrong number!

197
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:15,800
Strange, it can't be...

198
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:19,000
Maybe he had to move away suddenly?

199
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,400
But dad didn't say a word about it.

200
00:10:21,407 --> 00:10:24,200
Then, why don't you ask him one more time?

201
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,900
"Bus Stop: Horse Racing Track"

202
00:10:31,207 --> 00:10:34,900
What, Anno's phone number changed?

203
00:10:34,907 --> 00:10:36,000
That can't be.

204
00:10:36,007 --> 00:10:38,617
I asked him to come play mahjong just the other day.

205
00:10:38,807 --> 00:10:41,300
But, when I called, he said I had the wrong number.

206
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,100
Didn't he say anything about moving?

207
00:10:43,107 --> 00:10:45,900
Then, go to his parent's house and ask.

208
00:10:45,907 --> 00:10:47,700
They live near the hospital

209
00:10:47,707 --> 00:10:50,629
you said you were going to visit today!

210
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:57,300
Huh, you want to know if my son moved?

211
00:10:57,307 --> 00:11:01,300
Yes, when I called a while ago, it seems that his number changed.

212
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:05,000
Strange. I called him just a while ago.

213
00:11:05,007 --> 00:11:08,100
According to my son, he said that he had a cold

214
00:11:08,107 --> 00:11:10,300
and his voice sounded funny.

215
00:11:10,307 --> 00:11:12,651
He also said that he had to cancel the trip

216
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:16,100
he was planning to take on Thursday and Friday.

217
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:18,200
Oh, and he also mentioned that

218
00:11:18,207 --> 00:11:21,500
his cell phone broke yesterday, so his number changed.

219
00:11:21,507 --> 00:11:23,000
Maybe that's it?

220
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,665
No, I called his residence...

221
00:11:26,665 --> 00:11:29,700
You're Mr. Mouri's daughter, right?

222
00:11:29,707 --> 00:11:32,300
I'm sorry, but can we talk about this later?

223
00:11:32,307 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm sort of tied up right now

224
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:37,900
and got to rush over to the bank.

225
00:11:37,907 --> 00:11:43,700
Didn't your son mention that he was in some kind of trouble?

226
00:11:43,707 --> 00:11:45,300
Yes, sort of...

227
00:11:45,307 --> 00:11:47,800
And I'm sure he went on to say,

228
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,800
"I don't want anybody to know about this,"

229
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:53,000
"so don't talk about it to anyone"

230
00:11:55,307 --> 00:12:00,700
The fact is, one of his colleagues took company money and fled.

231
00:12:00,707 --> 00:12:03,700
He was about to start a new business and was told that

232
00:12:03,707 --> 00:12:05,900
he had to deposit the money today

233
00:12:05,907 --> 00:12:08,707
or, the company itself would go bankrupt.

234
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:10,709
So, I told him I'd talk to his father first

235
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:11,900
and do something about it

236
00:12:11,907 --> 00:12:14,200
but he said he had no time left.

237
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,715
What did he tell you to say when you go to deposit

238
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:18,300
the money into his account?

239
00:12:18,307 --> 00:12:20,300
Of course he told me to tell the bank that

240
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:22,500
this is an emergency since it's money to be used for business.

241
00:12:22,507 --> 00:12:24,723
What kind of business is it?

242
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:26,200
I think it has something to do

243
00:12:26,207 --> 00:12:28,000
with a shop selling authorized Rena Mizunashi goods

244
00:12:28,007 --> 00:12:29,200
or some mail order goods?

245
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,100
After all, she's popular.

246
00:12:31,107 --> 00:12:33,900
I guess so. Internet shopping is also a trend right now so...

247
00:12:33,907 --> 00:12:36,735
No, wrong.

248
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:41,300
It's true that it's going around though...

249
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:46,000
"Anno"

250
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:48,500
Go... going around?

251
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:52,000
This brat must think that it's a cold going around or something.

252
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:53,200
No, I don't.

253
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:56,755
I just think that the person who called

254
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:59,900
doesn't want to do what you just mentioned, Sonoko.

255
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:03,400
Why not? The man on the phone was this lady's son

256
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:05,900
and a great fan of Rena Mizunashi.

257
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:08,767
And, he's the one who wants to start a business.

258
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:10,200
So, it's got to be a Rena Mizunashi goods shop

259
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:13,100
or an internet shopping site. Don't you think?

260
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:15,600
How can you be so sure that it's not right?

261
00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:18,777
But, I wonder if your son's okay.

262
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:23,100
If his money was stolen, it has to be taken care of right away.

263
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:25,800
Yes, that's why I was thinking of going to the bank

264
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:27,300
to put up the money for now.

265
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:30,400
Oh no, the counters will close soon!

266
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,800
Bye, I'm sorry. I'll talk to you later.

267
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:33,900
Wait!

268
00:13:33,909 --> 00:13:37,600
Your son caught a cold and cancelled his trip, right?

269
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,200
Yes.

270
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:40,799
Then, isn't something funny?

271
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:43,700
Why would he be as easygoing as to take a trip

272
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:45,300
just when he's about to start something new?

273
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:47,300
He's going to entertain his business partners.

274
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:50,300
He was going to take the trip to entertain the people

275
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:52,500
who he would be doing business with from now.

276
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:58,200
But, he said his cell phone was broken and changed his number, right?

277
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:00,500
Huh? So what?

278
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:04,823
He changed his phone number since he got a new cell phone.

279
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:07,900
I mean, after all, his starting a new business, right?

280
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:10,300
But, he called his mother yesterday,

281
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:12,400
to tell her that his number had changed, right?

282
00:14:12,409 --> 00:14:15,600
If he changes his phone number at a busy time like this,

283
00:14:15,609 --> 00:14:19,700
I think that a lot of people will be troubled.

284
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:21,300
That's true.

285
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:24,200
He's got to notify all his colleagues and business partners

286
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:26,845
of his new phone number.

287
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:30,300
I don't think he would do something like that at a time like this

288
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:32,851
unless he had a good reason for doing so.

289
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:34,300
Then, why?

290
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:36,855
Maybe he was getting a lot of prank calls?

291
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:38,000
Come to think of it,

292
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:41,700
he did mention getting a lot of silent calls before.

293
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:42,861
What?

294
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:45,800
He also mentioned that after that his house was broken into too.

295
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:47,200
Broken into?

296
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:50,869
I'm sure the burglar called him to verify

297
00:14:51,109 --> 00:14:54,400
whether he was home or not.

298
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:02,900
Well, he always carries his valuables around with him,

299
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:06,300
so it seems that nothing was taken back then.

300
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:08,887
No, I think a wiretap was set up.

301
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:11,900
Wiretap?

302
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:23,700
I think that the one who broke in set up a wiretap back then

303
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:28,600
to check out your son's way of talking and voice.

304
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:33,500
Of course he knew that your son

305
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:35,800
would be on a trip this Thursday and Friday,

306
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,200
and the room would be empty too!

307
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:42,100
But, he said he caught a cold and cancelled the trip.

308
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,800
He's in his room right now.

309
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,100
Was the man really your son?

310
00:15:46,109 --> 00:15:50,300
Yes, I'm sure. I thought that his voice was hoarse

311
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:52,200
because of his cold.

312
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:54,933
The phone number that was displayed was his house phone too.

313
00:15:55,109 --> 00:15:58,500
There was also a dog barking. The dog barks a lot.

314
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:00,939
It's always barking bow-wow near the phone.

315
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:02,941
But a dog's bark is even more difficult to distinguish

316
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:04,943
than the voice of people, is it?

317
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:06,945
He probably made a dog with the same kind of voice

318
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:08,700
bark near the phone...

319
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:12,200
No, it could've been a tape or CD.

320
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:15,500
Huh, why would he go all out like that for?

321
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:18,957
So that you would completely believe that he's your son.

322
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:20,959
Hey, wait!

323
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,700
Don't tell me it's a bank transfer scam?

324
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:28,300
Because he's calling under the pretense of your son

325
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:30,200
and says he needs the money right away.

326
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:33,600
But, it's just this brat's imagination.

327
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:36,975
No, he's got a point, though!

328
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:40,500
If the culprit snuck into your son's room and is calling from there,

329
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:43,800
the number displayed on your screen would be that of your son's.

330
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:48,000
Furthermore, if he made you listen to the dog bark in the background...

331
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:52,700
He would completely deceive you into thinking he is your son.

332
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:56,500
Then, why did he say, "wrong number" when I called?

333
00:16:56,509 --> 00:17:00,999
You again, I said you have the wrong number!

334
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:04,500
Maybe that man was waiting for you to call.

335
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:06,500
Yes, I guess so.

336
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:09,900
He said to call him as soon as I transferred the money.

337
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:11,500
I'm sure that he was going to inform the others

338
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:13,011
that you transferred the money,

339
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:17,000
so that they could withdraw the money right away and flee.

340
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:20,600
I guess he didn't have the time to be answering a call

341
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,100
from somebody else at a time like this,

342
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:24,300
and still pretend to be your son.

343
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:28,000
Moreover, he called you just before the closing time of the bank.

344
00:17:28,009 --> 00:17:30,300
The more time you don't give the target to think,

345
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:33,031
the more successful this scam works.

346
00:17:33,209 --> 00:17:35,400
Of course, he tells you not to talk about it to anyone

347
00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:37,400
to keep you from realizing that it's a scam.

348
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:38,700
He told you to tell the teller

349
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:42,200
that it's money to be used for business, for the same reason.

350
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:43,800
This scam is widespread now,

351
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:45,043
that unless you say something like that,

352
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:48,600
the teller will get suspicious too.

353
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,100
I heard all this on the "Afternoon Wide Show" TV program.

354
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:55,053
You sure remember a lot of things, like usual, don't you, Conan?

355
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:57,500
You're just like a housewife who has nothing better than

356
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,057
to watch TV in the afternoon.

357
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:01,059
Which means that his cell phone breaking

358
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:04,200
and his phone number being changed are probably all lies.

359
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:05,900
He said all this so that you won't try to

360
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:07,900
get a hold of your son who is on a trip.

361
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:12,600
Yep, so I think you can find out right away if this is a scam or not

362
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:17,075
by calling your son's original cell phone number!

363
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:20,620
The number you have called

364
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,820
is either not within service range or switched off

365
00:18:23,825 --> 00:18:25,083
so cannot be connected.

366
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:29,087
-The number you have called... -Oh my, it won't connect.

367
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:33,720
Then, does it mean that it's true that his cell phone broke?

368
00:18:33,725 --> 00:18:35,820
Where did your son go?

369
00:18:35,825 --> 00:18:38,020
Sado, in Niigata.

370
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:41,120
I think he was scheduled to come home by 7:00 tonight.

371
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,620
7:00...

372
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:47,120
It takes an hour from Sado to Tokyo on the Jet Foil.

373
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:50,520
Then, it takes 2 hours and a half from Niigata on the Bullet train.

374
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:53,111
Calculating backwards,

375
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:56,320
he should be on board the Jet Foil and out at sea.

376
00:18:56,325 --> 00:18:59,820
Sometimes cell phones are out of the service area if you're out at sea.

377
00:18:59,825 --> 00:19:03,420
So, the culprit had all that figured out too.

378
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:06,400
I've got less than ten minutes.

379
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:09,127
I've got to go to the bank for sure this time!

380
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:10,700
No, don't go, Ma'am!

381
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:12,400
You're persistent, aren't you?

382
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:15,133
My son's saying that if he can't get hold of 10 million yen by today,

383
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:16,600
he's going to have to borrow it from loan sharks.

384
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:21,139
If he does so, then there'll be no turning back.

385
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:29,147
"Beika Central Bank"

386
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:37,600
What? You couldn't transfer the money?

387
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,700
No, because I had some sudden guests

388
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:41,159
and couldn't get to it right away.

389
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:42,500
I'm really sorry.

390
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:45,163
I told you to hurry it up.

391
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:48,500
You should've left right away after my call.

392
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:49,600
But, you did say that

393
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:52,100
you were going to the loan shark for the cash,

394
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:54,100
so I guess all you have to do is come up with the money for today

395
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,700
for the moment, right?

396
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:58,400
Yeah, I guess so.

397
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:03,181
Will my sugar-bowl savings be able to cover for the time being then?

398
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:05,800
Sugar-bowl savings? How much?

399
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:07,900
I was saving up just in case, for times like this.

400
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:09,600
I've got about 2 million yen.

401
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:13,191
I sent you the card together with the pass code yesterday

402
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:16,600
so that you can withdraw the money, so it should already be there.

403
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:18,200
Won't that do?

404
00:20:18,209 --> 00:20:21,199
Yeah, I guess I can make do for the time being.

405
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:24,300
I'll go withdraw the cash right now.

406
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:27,205
I'm sorry I yelled at you, Mom.

407
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:40,000
Who are you?

408
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:42,000
Well... you see.

409
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:45,000
Darn it! Move it!

410
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:11,249
So, the culprit of the bank transfer scam was arrested right away.

411
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:13,700
His accomplice who was waiting for the transfer at the bank

412
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:15,253
was also arrested,

413
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:17,255
and this alleged bank transfer scam was prevented

414
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:19,700
before any damage was done.

415
00:21:19,709 --> 00:21:22,300
In other words, the simplest and most effective method

416
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:24,700
of not being taken in by such scams

417
00:21:24,709 --> 00:21:27,265
is to not make rash decisions alone.

418
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:29,900
And, though it doesn't matter who, talk about it to somebody!

419
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:32,300
By putting the situation into words and explaining,

420
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:33,800
you can organize the situation

421
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:36,800
and take in the situation more calmly.

422
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:39,277
This way, if they or the person they discuss with

423
00:21:39,509 --> 00:21:41,300
are even a little bit suspicious...

424
00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:44,300
This kind of scam can be prevented.

425
00:21:54,209 --> 00:21:56,800
Mom.

426
00:21:57,295 --> 00:22:00,100
What? You were targeted by a bank transfer scam!

427
00:22:00,109 --> 00:22:01,900
You, mom!

428
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:05,303
Yes. But, these children kept me from being deceived.

429
00:22:05,303 --> 00:22:08,100
It's been a long time. I'm Ran Mouri.

430
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:09,800
Hi Aina, long time no see.

431
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:14,200
Oh, I see, you're Mr. Mouri's...

432
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:17,315
But, what brings you here?

433
00:22:17,315 --> 00:22:19,317
We came to see you.

434
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:23,000
We have a favor to ask you, sir.

435
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,100
This person.

436
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:28,000
We want you to take a look at Rena Mizunashi's picture.

437
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,160
Next Conan's Hint:

438
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,342
Blood transfusion.

439
00:24:06,342 --> 00:24:08,040
Ran, what blood type are you?

440
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,100
The same as Shinichi's.

441
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,560
Me too... I mean, of course.
