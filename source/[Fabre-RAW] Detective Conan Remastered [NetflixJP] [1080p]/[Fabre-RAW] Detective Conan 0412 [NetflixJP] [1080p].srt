1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,830
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,730
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,430
Dr. Agasa's weird code

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,930
is tough for the Youth Detective Squad.

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,930
Who's going to be the first to solve it?

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,330
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,030
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,430
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,522 --> 00:01:59,122
One hot summer day,

10
00:01:59,122 --> 00:02:02,022
we came to collect insects.

11
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:04,822
Doc gave us a code quiz "pill bug and a tent",

12
00:02:04,822 --> 00:02:08,322
which would lead us to where the treasure is hidden.

13
00:02:08,322 --> 00:02:10,522
But I couldn't solve the code either.

14
00:02:11,822 --> 00:02:14,922
Meanwhile, I get a call from Ran and Sonoko who are at the beach

15
00:02:14,922 --> 00:02:19,722
saying that there was a murder at the hotel that they're staying at.

16
00:02:21,422 --> 00:02:25,822
Sonoko remembered that there was something written on the window

17
00:02:25,822 --> 00:02:29,622
of the hotel room where the man was killed.

18
00:02:29,622 --> 00:02:30,622
What kind of writing?

19
00:02:32,122 --> 00:02:33,522
Something like a code.

20
00:02:33,522 --> 00:02:36,322
And who found the body?

21
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,822
The three friends of Mr. Miyama who was killed.

22
00:02:40,822 --> 00:02:43,322
Mr. Miyama and the three of them were planning to have dinner together.

23
00:02:43,322 --> 00:02:45,922
So they went to his room to get him because he didn't come.

24
00:02:45,922 --> 00:02:51,922
They found the door was unlocked and the window was broken.

25
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,922
Mr. Miyama was found on the floor near the window.

26
00:02:54,922 --> 00:02:57,122
This is what they testified to the police.

27
00:02:58,222 --> 00:02:59,622
Then we...

28
00:03:00,822 --> 00:03:05,822
Then, is the "tent" in the code points to the Tento festival?

29
00:03:05,822 --> 00:03:10,322
Even so, I still don't understand the pill bug part.

30
00:03:10,322 --> 00:03:12,422
That's where...

31
00:03:12,422 --> 00:03:14,822
Marumushi Hot Spring is located.

32
00:03:15,822 --> 00:03:17,922
"Pill bug and tent..."

33
00:03:17,922 --> 00:03:19,422
Does that mean to light it up?

34
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:30,222
"Shrine Torii Gate Surprising Code (Part 2)"

35
00:03:34,922 --> 00:03:36,822
Huh?

36
00:03:36,822 --> 00:03:38,922
There are a lot of people.

37
00:03:38,922 --> 00:03:41,622
There must be some kind of a gathering, don't you think?

38
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:44,422
Stupid! Take a closer look.

39
00:03:44,422 --> 00:03:46,822
Everyone is holding a basin.

40
00:03:46,822 --> 00:03:48,922
It's true!

41
00:03:48,922 --> 00:03:51,822
The villagers probably bought the closed down inn

42
00:03:51,822 --> 00:03:54,422
and are using it as a public bath.

43
00:03:54,422 --> 00:03:56,122
I see.

44
00:03:56,122 --> 00:03:59,822
Sento (Public bath)?

45
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:04,122
Maybe this "tento" (tent) means "sento" (public bath).

46
00:04:04,122 --> 00:04:05,822
No matter how you look at it, Genta,

47
00:04:05,822 --> 00:04:09,122
this "te" doesn't look like "se".

48
00:04:09,122 --> 00:04:11,322
And it can't be "tentou"

49
00:04:11,322 --> 00:04:13,822
because there's no "u" after the "tento".

50
00:04:13,822 --> 00:04:15,922
"U"?

51
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,622
Darn it!

52
00:04:18,622 --> 00:04:20,222
I don't get it!

53
00:04:20,222 --> 00:04:24,122
Genta, don't lie down in despair.

54
00:04:24,122 --> 00:04:26,122
I'm not in despair.

55
00:04:26,122 --> 00:04:30,622
Doc told us to lie down and think it through,

56
00:04:30,622 --> 00:04:32,722
and I just might get it.

57
00:04:32,722 --> 00:04:34,222
But...

58
00:04:34,222 --> 00:04:38,822
Ai was saying that if we still don't get it,

59
00:04:38,822 --> 00:04:41,622
we should wash our faces and start anew.

60
00:04:41,622 --> 00:04:44,222
Since there's a public bath,

61
00:04:44,222 --> 00:04:47,222
why don't we go and wash our faces and our bodies?

62
00:04:47,222 --> 00:04:48,622
That's a great idea!

63
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,822
It's no use.

64
00:04:51,822 --> 00:04:53,022
Ai.

65
00:04:53,022 --> 00:04:56,522
It's no use going to that inn. There's nothing there.

66
00:04:56,522 --> 00:04:58,622
You guys have to try and think a little bit more.

67
00:04:58,622 --> 00:05:00,522
Then tell us!

68
00:05:00,522 --> 00:05:02,622
Where is the treasure?

69
00:05:02,622 --> 00:05:04,622
Please tell us.

70
00:05:04,622 --> 00:05:08,022
Sure, I can tell you.

71
00:05:08,022 --> 00:05:09,822
Only if someone here gives up.

72
00:05:13,622 --> 00:05:15,022
I'm not giving up!

73
00:05:16,422 --> 00:05:17,422
A mail.

74
00:05:19,522 --> 00:05:21,122
It's from Sonoko.

75
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:22,222
Huh?

76
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:25,522
I thought her cell phone was in the bag that was stolen.

77
00:05:28,322 --> 00:05:30,822
I found this bag on the street

78
00:05:30,822 --> 00:05:33,622
and since there was no ID,

79
00:05:33,622 --> 00:05:37,322
I mailed the most recent person

80
00:05:37,322 --> 00:05:41,322
the cell phone listed to have sent a mail to.

81
00:05:41,322 --> 00:05:43,222
I want to send this bag to you,

82
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:47,622
so can you please give me your address and name?

83
00:05:47,622 --> 00:05:50,022
It seems like the purse-snatcher just took the purse

84
00:05:50,022 --> 00:05:51,722
and threw the bag away.

85
00:05:53,722 --> 00:05:58,722
Wouldn't you usually ask for the address and name of the owner of the bag?

86
00:05:58,722 --> 00:06:01,222
Why did this person send a mail?

87
00:06:01,222 --> 00:06:02,422
Wouldn't it be quicker to look at the record of calls made

88
00:06:02,422 --> 00:06:04,622
and call someone from that list?

89
00:06:04,622 --> 00:06:06,522
Huh?

90
00:06:06,522 --> 00:06:08,522
You give up, right?

91
00:06:10,022 --> 00:06:11,622
Time out!

92
00:06:13,722 --> 00:06:17,422
Take the bag to the police if you found it.

93
00:06:18,422 --> 00:06:20,222
Hello, Ran?

94
00:06:20,222 --> 00:06:23,822
I just got mail from the person who found Sonoko's bag.

95
00:06:23,822 --> 00:06:25,822
Oh, really?

96
00:06:25,822 --> 00:06:30,422
You'll probably receive a mail, too.

97
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:33,122
-So you can do something about it. -I'm sorry.

98
00:06:33,122 --> 00:06:34,122
What's up?

99
00:06:34,122 --> 00:06:36,422
My cell phone's battery is low.

100
00:06:36,422 --> 00:06:38,722
I'm at the police station right now.

101
00:06:38,722 --> 00:06:41,122
I'll get back to you when I return to the hotel.

102
00:06:41,122 --> 00:06:45,422
Then did you tell them that the letters might mean "tel shite"?

103
00:06:45,422 --> 00:06:51,922
The police and Mr. Miyama's three friends are saying that it makes sense.

104
00:06:51,922 --> 00:06:55,622
But that doesn't help to specify the killer,

105
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:58,422
so we're going back to the hotel for now.

106
00:06:58,422 --> 00:07:00,822
Hey, be careful.

107
00:07:00,822 --> 00:07:03,522
The purse-snatcher is probably still roaming the streets.

108
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:05,722
We'll be all right!

109
00:07:07,022 --> 00:07:08,822
I just asked Mr. Kanou

110
00:07:08,822 --> 00:07:12,822
-to take me and your wife back to the hotel! -Wife?

111
00:07:12,822 --> 00:07:15,022
Who's Kanou?

112
00:07:15,022 --> 00:07:17,122
Ran was just talking to you about him.

113
00:07:17,122 --> 00:07:19,322
Mr. Miyama's good looking friend.

114
00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:20,522
A good looking guy!

115
00:07:20,522 --> 00:07:24,122
-Sonoko. -What's the big deal? It's true.

116
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:26,822
The other two friends are with him, right?

117
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:29,222
It seems like he's alone.

118
00:07:29,222 --> 00:07:32,522
Mr. Miyama's girlfriend, Miss Yanuma

119
00:07:32,522 --> 00:07:34,922
is still being questioned by the police,

120
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:39,322
so Mr. Kanou was planning to wait for her in his car until she finished.

121
00:07:39,322 --> 00:07:42,122
But Mr. Bito seems to have returned to the hotel already.

122
00:07:42,122 --> 00:07:46,822
Since Miss Yanuma's questioning is taking time,

123
00:07:46,822 --> 00:07:49,622
Mr. Kanou will be taking us back to the hotel

124
00:07:49,622 --> 00:07:51,322
and return again to pick her up.

125
00:07:51,322 --> 00:07:52,722
Okay.

126
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,822
I'm hanging up now. My cell phone is really running out of battery.

127
00:07:57,322 --> 00:07:59,022
Come on.

128
00:07:59,022 --> 00:08:01,922
I should have gone to the beach, too.

129
00:08:01,922 --> 00:08:03,222
Beach?

130
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:06,722
Talking about the beach, I found a jellyfish.

131
00:08:06,722 --> 00:08:08,822
What are you talking about, Ayumi?

132
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:12,122
There are no jellyfish in the mountains.

133
00:08:12,122 --> 00:08:13,522
Yes, there are.

134
00:08:15,422 --> 00:08:16,722
See! Over there!

135
00:08:19,322 --> 00:08:21,022
Really?

136
00:08:22,722 --> 00:08:25,122
See. A jellyfish!

137
00:08:27,422 --> 00:08:29,022
True.

138
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:32,922
Turn the hot spring mark upside down and it looks like a jellyfish.

139
00:08:32,922 --> 00:08:34,722
-Right? -A jellyfish.

140
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,422
I can see it.

141
00:08:40,122 --> 00:08:44,522
Turn the hot spring mark upside down and it looks like a jellyfish.

142
00:08:50,622 --> 00:08:53,222
So that's it. That's what it is.

143
00:08:55,922 --> 00:08:59,022
Lie down and wash you face.

144
00:09:02,022 --> 00:09:03,622
How stupid of me.

145
00:09:04,622 --> 00:09:08,322
Having trouble with a code like this.

146
00:09:08,322 --> 00:09:12,322
Well, sometimes easy codes are difficult to solve.

147
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:15,922
Doc!

148
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:20,522
It's about time. Tell us the answer.

149
00:09:20,522 --> 00:09:22,822
What is the meaning behind the code?

150
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,822
Alright.

151
00:09:25,822 --> 00:09:29,822
No! I won't tell you until everyone gives up.

152
00:09:29,822 --> 00:09:33,022
I'll give up so just tell me.

153
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:35,022
That's not fair, Genta.

154
00:09:35,022 --> 00:09:36,322
Why Ran?

155
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:37,922
Conan!

156
00:09:39,122 --> 00:09:41,222
Can't you solve it?

157
00:09:43,822 --> 00:09:46,722
It's totally Greek to me, I haven't got a clue.

158
00:09:46,722 --> 00:09:49,122
Then hurry up and give up!

159
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:52,822
Conan, just admit your defeat already!

160
00:09:52,822 --> 00:09:55,222
You guys give up too easily.

161
00:09:57,522 --> 00:10:00,422
It seems like Shinichi can't solve it either.

162
00:10:02,422 --> 00:10:04,922
Anyway, let's think it over from the very beginning.

163
00:10:06,822 --> 00:10:10,222
First, all these codes are written only in Katakana.

164
00:10:10,222 --> 00:10:13,522
It's understandable that pill bug and tent are written in Katakana.

165
00:10:13,522 --> 00:10:17,222
Don't you think its weird for the "ni" in between is in Katakana, too?

166
00:10:17,222 --> 00:10:18,822
That's true.

167
00:10:18,822 --> 00:10:23,922
Secondly, if you look closely, the letters are not balanced.

168
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:25,022
That's true!

169
00:10:25,022 --> 00:10:28,322
Isn't that because Doc's handwriting is messy?

170
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,622
And thirdly,

171
00:10:32,622 --> 00:10:35,022
the hint Dr and Haibara was talking about.

172
00:10:36,422 --> 00:10:38,822
Did they give us a hint?

173
00:10:38,822 --> 00:10:43,322
Yes. "Lie down and think carefully",

174
00:10:43,322 --> 00:10:46,822
and "if you still don't get it, wash your face and start anew"

175
00:10:46,822 --> 00:10:49,822
are things Doc and Haibara don't usually say.

176
00:10:49,822 --> 00:10:51,522
It's obviously a hint!

177
00:10:51,522 --> 00:10:55,722
Maybe it means to lie down and look at these letters.

178
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:56,722
Okay!

179
00:10:58,222 --> 00:11:00,922
Lie down, right?

180
00:11:05,022 --> 00:11:07,822
I don't see anything different.

181
00:11:09,822 --> 00:11:11,222
What happened, Genta?

182
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:13,522
Did you get something?

183
00:11:18,022 --> 00:11:19,022
What?

184
00:11:19,022 --> 00:11:22,122
Genta, what's going on?

185
00:11:22,122 --> 00:11:25,422
No, I thought I almost got it.

186
00:11:25,422 --> 00:11:28,522
-Almost? -Which is it?

187
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:29,622
Shut up!

188
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,222
I thought I could almost read it when I lied down.

189
00:11:33,222 --> 00:11:34,822
Close call, close call.

190
00:11:34,822 --> 00:11:36,322
No.

191
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:40,322
That smile, that provoking annoying look.

192
00:11:41,522 --> 00:11:43,822
He probably already knows it.

193
00:11:47,322 --> 00:11:50,722
Nothing comes to mind even if I look at it from the side.

194
00:11:52,322 --> 00:11:56,322
Then let's look at the other hint.

195
00:11:56,322 --> 00:12:00,122
You mean the "go wash your face"?

196
00:12:00,122 --> 00:12:04,922
But to wash your face in the middle of the woods...

197
00:12:04,922 --> 00:12:06,222
Maybe...

198
00:12:06,222 --> 00:12:10,122
Does it mean to go take a bath in the inn?

199
00:12:10,122 --> 00:12:11,122
Stupid.

200
00:12:11,122 --> 00:12:15,422
Didn't Haibara and Doc said there was nothing at the inn?

201
00:12:15,422 --> 00:12:17,622
Then where do you say we should wash?

202
00:12:17,622 --> 00:12:18,822
That's right!

203
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:22,722
I don't know. Maybe it doesn't mean to actually wash your face.

204
00:12:22,722 --> 00:12:25,722
Maybe it has something to do with what you do when you wash your face.

205
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,222
First of all, turn the faucet on.

206
00:12:29,222 --> 00:12:31,522
Splash water on your face.

207
00:12:31,522 --> 00:12:33,922
Wipe your face with a towel.

208
00:12:33,922 --> 00:12:35,622
And then, after that?

209
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:36,922
After that is...

210
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,122
Let's see...

211
00:12:40,822 --> 00:12:42,822
Let's eat!

212
00:12:42,822 --> 00:12:44,422
Hey, Genta.

213
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:46,422
We're talking about when we are washing our faces.

214
00:12:46,422 --> 00:12:48,922
You eat after you wash your face, don't you?

215
00:12:48,922 --> 00:12:50,722
Mirror!

216
00:12:50,722 --> 00:12:52,822
After that, I look in the mirror!

217
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:54,122
Mirror?

218
00:12:54,122 --> 00:12:57,422
You can only see your face in it.

219
00:12:57,422 --> 00:12:59,722
I'm getting more mixed up!

220
00:12:59,722 --> 00:13:02,522
I think the mirror is on the right track.

221
00:13:02,522 --> 00:13:03,722
Look.

222
00:13:03,722 --> 00:13:07,422
Turn it upside down like that hot spring mark

223
00:13:07,422 --> 00:13:10,222
and it looks like something totally different, like the jellyfish.

224
00:13:11,622 --> 00:13:13,022
Even if I hold it upside down,

225
00:13:13,022 --> 00:13:15,722
it doesn't look like a porgy or a flounder.

226
00:13:15,722 --> 00:13:17,922
I can't even read what it says.

227
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,622
Wait a minute.

228
00:13:19,622 --> 00:13:23,822
Could it be to wash your face while lying down?

229
00:13:23,822 --> 00:13:25,322
To look at the mirror with the letters written downwards

230
00:13:25,322 --> 00:13:27,522
by turning it sideways?

231
00:13:27,522 --> 00:13:28,822
Turn it sideways,

232
00:13:28,822 --> 00:13:32,322
reverse the paper and look at it through the mirror.

233
00:13:47,622 --> 00:13:51,322
"Mura matsuri no torii."

234
00:13:52,722 --> 00:13:54,722
The shrine gate of the village festival...

235
00:13:55,722 --> 00:13:57,322
It's that shrine!

236
00:13:57,322 --> 00:14:00,222
Isn't that right, Doc, Ai?

237
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:02,722
Correct!

238
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:04,522
You're correct!

239
00:14:05,722 --> 00:14:07,122
We did it...

240
00:14:07,122 --> 00:14:09,122
-We did it! -We did it!

241
00:14:10,622 --> 00:14:12,722
Let's hurry and go there!

242
00:14:12,722 --> 00:14:14,022
Treasure!

243
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,322
Oh, my.

244
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:22,522
You look like you taught the kids that they can do it if they try.

245
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,522
Don't I look great?

246
00:14:28,822 --> 00:14:31,422
Shinichi, aren't you going to go see what the treasure is?

247
00:14:31,422 --> 00:14:34,222
I bet you want to see it, too.

248
00:14:34,222 --> 00:14:36,722
I don't have to see it to know what it is.

249
00:14:36,722 --> 00:14:38,222
The place of the code

250
00:14:38,222 --> 00:14:42,922
is the torii gate of the shrine that's lit up even late at night.

251
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:52,522
If we put sap on the pole of the torii gate...

252
00:14:53,922 --> 00:14:56,722
I'll bet a lot will come.

253
00:14:56,722 --> 00:14:57,922
I found it!

254
00:14:59,322 --> 00:15:01,322
Amazing!

255
00:15:01,322 --> 00:15:03,522
Unicorn beetles and stag beetles.

256
00:15:04,522 --> 00:15:06,722
That's right!

257
00:15:07,722 --> 00:15:09,122
Anyway...

258
00:15:10,722 --> 00:15:14,022
you did a great job with the code.

259
00:15:14,022 --> 00:15:16,522
This can be read from the front and back.

260
00:15:16,522 --> 00:15:19,222
Thanks to Ai.

261
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:23,222
First, we were going to make it an animal code.

262
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:29,722
We thought of sticking paper with animal names on the window!

263
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:33,922
Watching that from the outside, Ai told me...

264
00:15:33,922 --> 00:15:37,722
Isn't "sanso" (oxygen) a little bit hard for the kids?

265
00:15:37,722 --> 00:15:39,222
Like that.

266
00:15:39,222 --> 00:15:44,022
I see. The letters "kirin" (giraffe) looked like "sanso"

267
00:15:44,022 --> 00:15:46,222
from the back and you thought of the code.

268
00:15:48,422 --> 00:15:49,622
Shinichi?

269
00:15:50,622 --> 00:15:53,322
Glass?

270
00:15:53,322 --> 00:15:55,222
Back?

271
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:57,222
See through...

272
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:58,922
Wait a minute.

273
00:15:58,922 --> 00:16:00,722
This is...

274
00:16:02,722 --> 00:16:05,422
Darn it! That's it!

275
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,422
-Shinichi? -Kudo?

276
00:16:07,422 --> 00:16:08,922
So that was it!

277
00:16:08,922 --> 00:16:11,822
That's why Ran's face crossed my mind.

278
00:16:11,822 --> 00:16:15,122
Ran's in danger!

279
00:16:25,723 --> 00:16:27,923
Shinichi?

280
00:16:27,923 --> 00:16:29,423
Where am I?

281
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:30,923
Didn't I told you earlier?

282
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,623
We're returning to the hotel in Mr. Kanou's car.

283
00:16:33,623 --> 00:16:36,423
What? Get out of the car now?

284
00:16:36,423 --> 00:16:39,423
I got what "t, e, i, u" really means!

285
00:16:40,423 --> 00:16:46,523
There was a little punctuation before the "t" in "t, e, i, u"!

286
00:16:46,523 --> 00:16:49,323
Put that vertical and reverse it!

287
00:16:49,323 --> 00:16:51,023
It's the killer's name.

288
00:16:52,123 --> 00:16:54,223
Hey, Ran?

289
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:56,223
Ran! Ran!

290
00:16:58,423 --> 00:17:00,123
The battery's dead.

291
00:17:00,123 --> 00:17:01,723
What did your husband say?

292
00:17:01,723 --> 00:17:04,223
Hey, Sonoko!

293
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:07,223
Get out of the car, make it vertical and reverse it?

294
00:17:07,223 --> 00:17:08,623
What is it?

295
00:17:09,823 --> 00:17:12,023
Maybe he's just jealous?

296
00:17:13,523 --> 00:17:15,223
No way.

297
00:17:17,423 --> 00:17:20,923
Ran and Sonoko are in trouble?

298
00:17:20,923 --> 00:17:23,923
Yes. Sonoko saw it!

299
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:26,923
The letters written by the person murdered in the hotel room.

300
00:17:26,923 --> 00:17:28,623
Letters?

301
00:17:28,623 --> 00:17:32,623
It was in lower case alphabet written horizontally!

302
00:17:32,623 --> 00:17:33,823
To be more accurate,

303
00:17:33,823 --> 00:17:37,523
there's a comma before the "t" and a dot on "i" which supposed to be "l",

304
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,323
and the "u" is the "shi" in Hiragana.

305
00:17:40,323 --> 00:17:43,023
It's the same as "mura matsuri no torii",

306
00:17:43,023 --> 00:17:45,923
turn the horizontally written letters vertical,

307
00:17:45,923 --> 00:17:48,423
and read it from the back.

308
00:17:48,423 --> 00:17:50,323
It's "Maru mushi ni tento".

309
00:17:50,323 --> 00:17:52,923
Make "sanso" vertical and read it from the back.

310
00:17:52,923 --> 00:17:54,223
It's "kirin".

311
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:56,123
Then, what about "t, e, i, u"?

312
00:17:57,723 --> 00:17:59,823
That is...

313
00:17:59,823 --> 00:18:02,023
It becomes "Kanou".

314
00:18:03,823 --> 00:18:05,523
Kanou.

315
00:18:08,223 --> 00:18:13,923
Why did he leave such a difficult code as a dying message?

316
00:18:13,923 --> 00:18:16,723
It's not a code!

317
00:18:16,723 --> 00:18:19,223
The victim fell on the floor

318
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,023
and wrote the words on the window from the inside.

319
00:18:22,023 --> 00:18:25,623
And Sonoko saw the letters from the outside.

320
00:18:25,623 --> 00:18:29,823
Then we have to hurry and tell Ran.

321
00:18:29,823 --> 00:18:33,123
Ran's phone is dead.

322
00:18:33,123 --> 00:18:38,423
And the thing is, Ran and Sonoko are both in that Kanou's car!

323
00:18:46,723 --> 00:18:50,623
Hey. This is not the way to the hotel.

324
00:18:50,623 --> 00:18:53,723
Don't worry, it's a short cut.

325
00:18:53,723 --> 00:18:57,723
Where's the hotel those two are staying at?

326
00:18:57,723 --> 00:19:01,423
If I knew, I would call the police!

327
00:19:01,423 --> 00:19:03,123
They told me they were going to the beach,

328
00:19:03,123 --> 00:19:04,723
but I don't know where.

329
00:19:04,723 --> 00:19:08,023
Darn it! I should've realized this earlier.

330
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:10,623
When I received the weird mail from Sonoko's cell phone

331
00:19:10,623 --> 00:19:14,523
which was thought to be mugged!

332
00:19:14,523 --> 00:19:18,323
The picture sent to my cell phone, he wanted to delete the picture

333
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,623
with the dying message.

334
00:19:20,623 --> 00:19:23,223
That's why he asked for my address and name.

335
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:26,623
Wait a minute, then it must mean...

336
00:19:28,223 --> 00:19:30,123
The guy you were talking about, Shinichi,

337
00:19:30,123 --> 00:19:32,323
he's only in high school, yet he's a detective?

338
00:19:32,323 --> 00:19:33,923
Yes, sort of.

339
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,823
It's great to have a detective boyfriend.

340
00:19:36,823 --> 00:19:40,023
No, he's not my boyfriend.

341
00:19:40,023 --> 00:19:42,323
They're so lovey-dovey.

342
00:19:42,323 --> 00:19:48,723
That's why I sent her boyfriend a picture of her in her bathing suit.

343
00:19:48,723 --> 00:19:50,123
Hey, Sonoko!

344
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:53,723
That's so unfortunate.

345
00:19:53,723 --> 00:19:56,023
Shinichi is not here, right?

346
00:19:56,023 --> 00:20:00,023
I would have liked to meet the detective.

347
00:20:00,023 --> 00:20:04,223
-He must be devouring that photo right now. -Sonoko!

348
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,523
Nonsense!

349
00:20:09,523 --> 00:20:12,323
If the killer is waiting for me to contact him,

350
00:20:12,323 --> 00:20:16,323
he should be carrying Sonoko's cell phone around with it switched on.

351
00:20:16,323 --> 00:20:17,423
Please realize it.

352
00:20:17,423 --> 00:20:20,423
That's the man. He's the killer!

353
00:20:22,323 --> 00:20:26,023
Huh? That tune is the same as Sonoko's.

354
00:20:26,023 --> 00:20:29,223
Or rather, that is mine.

355
00:20:30,923 --> 00:20:32,323
You're right!

356
00:20:32,323 --> 00:20:34,523
Really? But why?

357
00:20:35,523 --> 00:20:37,423
Of course.

358
00:20:37,423 --> 00:20:41,223
I'm the one who snatched the purse from you.

359
00:20:44,523 --> 00:20:47,423
To erase the evidence of the killing.

360
00:20:47,423 --> 00:20:48,723
-What? - Huh?

361
00:20:48,723 --> 00:20:54,023
When we go a little farther, I want you to talk to me.

362
00:20:54,023 --> 00:20:57,123
And give me the address of the kid Shinichi, too!

363
00:21:00,623 --> 00:21:02,123
He still won't answer?

364
00:21:02,123 --> 00:21:03,923
Be quiet!

365
00:21:03,923 --> 00:21:05,023
Okay.

366
00:21:07,423 --> 00:21:08,923
He answered?

367
00:21:08,923 --> 00:21:11,123
Hello? Hello?

368
00:21:12,123 --> 00:21:13,823
Hello?

369
00:22:39,723 --> 00:22:42,023
What do you mean hello?

370
00:22:42,023 --> 00:22:44,823
Where were you when Ran needed you?

371
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:46,623
Hey, are you listening?

372
00:22:46,623 --> 00:22:48,823
-Where... -Are you listening?

373
00:22:48,823 --> 00:22:53,223
The car crashed into a tree, and it was so much trouble!

374
00:22:53,223 --> 00:22:55,723
The car? Why'd it ram into a tree?

375
00:22:55,723 --> 00:22:58,323
Don't ask me why. It just happened.

376
00:22:58,323 --> 00:23:01,823
Ran side kicked the face of the killer

377
00:23:01,823 --> 00:23:05,323
who was driving the car.

378
00:23:05,323 --> 00:23:07,523
Is that right?

379
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:13,023
After that, the police that Sonoko called arrived

380
00:23:13,023 --> 00:23:15,023
and the killer was taken into custody.

381
00:23:16,423 --> 00:23:20,423
His motive for committing the murder was because his friend found out

382
00:23:20,423 --> 00:23:22,623
about his illegal enrolment to the university and he was being blackmailed.

383
00:23:22,623 --> 00:23:26,323
He committed a more serious crime to hide his first criminal act

384
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:28,623
which was a typical pattern for cases like these.

385
00:23:30,023 --> 00:23:31,523
Then...

386
00:23:31,523 --> 00:23:32,923
Huh?

387
00:23:32,923 --> 00:23:35,723
I thought I saved it here.

388
00:23:37,123 --> 00:23:39,023
If it's the picture of the lady in the bathing suit,

389
00:23:39,023 --> 00:23:40,723
I've deleted it for you!

390
00:23:41,823 --> 00:23:43,123
Why?

391
00:23:43,123 --> 00:23:46,523
What do you mean by why? It's against the law!

392
00:23:46,523 --> 00:23:49,923
Sorry. I asked Ai to delete it.

393
00:23:50,923 --> 00:23:52,423
Haibara?

394
00:23:54,223 --> 00:23:55,823
You...

395
00:23:55,823 --> 00:23:57,823
Darn it!

396
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,850
Next Conan's Hint:

397
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,150
"The two cups"

398
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,550
What's title of the next episode?

399
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:40,650
It's half of the complete, so if eel over rice is used as analogy.
