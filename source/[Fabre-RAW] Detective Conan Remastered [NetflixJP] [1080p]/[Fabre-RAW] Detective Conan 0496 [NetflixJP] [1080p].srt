1
00:00:02,454 --> 00:00:04,554
Eisuke Hondo, searches for his older sister

2
00:00:04,554 --> 00:00:06,654
who looks exactly like Kir of the Black Organization,

3
00:00:06,654 --> 00:00:09,354
more commonly know as Rena Mizunashi.

4
00:00:09,354 --> 00:00:12,054
We find out that his father had been an informant for the CIA,

5
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:16,254
who seems to have been killed by Rena Mizunashi four years ago.

6
00:00:18,054 --> 00:00:20,754
After Eisuke had visited the hospital

7
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:23,654
where Rena Mizunashi was lying in a coma,

8
00:00:23,654 --> 00:00:26,054
no one had been able to get a hold of him.

9
00:00:26,054 --> 00:00:28,054
Moreover, we find out that

10
00:00:28,054 --> 00:00:31,254
a member of the Organization is hiding in the hospital.

11
00:00:32,554 --> 00:00:34,354
There's no reason why they would leave a boy

12
00:00:34,354 --> 00:00:36,054
who knows the boss' address,

13
00:00:36,054 --> 00:00:39,554
and is trying to approach them, doing as he pleases.

14
00:00:39,554 --> 00:00:42,954
Well, if you're worrying about what's become of NOC's kid,

15
00:00:42,954 --> 00:00:44,954
it's no use.

16
00:00:59,154 --> 00:01:00,754
Sizzling hot suspense.

17
00:01:00,754 --> 00:01:03,554
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

18
00:01:03,554 --> 00:01:05,354
A member of the Organization hides in the hospital.

19
00:01:05,354 --> 00:01:07,454
The dangerous risk of disclosing their identity!

20
00:01:07,454 --> 00:01:09,054
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:09,054 --> 00:01:10,854
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:10,854 --> 00:01:13,154
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

23
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:47,144
"Red and Black Crash: Raid"

24
00:02:47,144 --> 00:02:49,644
"Haido Central Hospital"

25
00:02:54,844 --> 00:02:58,444
Oh, wait, sonny!

26
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,144
I finally found you!

27
00:03:00,144 --> 00:03:01,444
I've been looking for you.

28
00:03:01,444 --> 00:03:02,944
Looking for me?

29
00:03:02,944 --> 00:03:05,844
Did you recall something about the man we talked about a while ago?

30
00:03:05,844 --> 00:03:10,544
No, I just remembered something about the boy wearing glasses!

31
00:03:10,544 --> 00:03:13,244
His name was Eisuke, wasn't it?

32
00:03:13,244 --> 00:03:14,844
Yes, right.

33
00:03:14,844 --> 00:03:16,144
Just as I thought!

34
00:03:16,144 --> 00:03:18,344
He's the boy who went through surgery back then!

35
00:03:18,344 --> 00:03:19,844
Huh?

36
00:03:19,844 --> 00:03:22,844
I knew he looked familiar.

37
00:03:22,844 --> 00:03:24,544
If I remember correctly, I'm pretty sure that

38
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:28,444
he's the boy who underwent surgery at the hospital I worked for before.

39
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:31,344
Then, was that a hospital in Osaka?

40
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,944
Because I heard from Eisuke that right after his mother died,

41
00:03:33,944 --> 00:03:37,044
he moved to Osaka and got into an accident.

42
00:03:37,044 --> 00:03:40,744
No. He underwent surgery at a hospital in Tokyo.

43
00:03:40,744 --> 00:03:43,044
Of course not here, but at another hospital.

44
00:03:43,044 --> 00:03:45,944
His mother accompanied him then,

45
00:03:45,944 --> 00:03:48,144
so I think it was before he moved?

46
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,044
Huh, his mother?

47
00:03:50,044 --> 00:03:52,644
And? What kind of surgery did he go through?

48
00:03:52,644 --> 00:03:55,544
Well, he... Eisuke...

49
00:03:55,544 --> 00:03:57,944
had leukemia.

50
00:03:59,544 --> 00:04:01,444
Gee, but after going through such a big surgery,

51
00:04:01,444 --> 00:04:03,644
if he got in an accident again,

52
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:06,944
talk about haunted with bad luck, that boy.

53
00:04:12,244 --> 00:04:13,944
Good news!

54
00:04:13,944 --> 00:04:15,944
The people who have been admitted to the hospital

55
00:04:15,944 --> 00:04:17,244
between the 18th and 21st

56
00:04:17,244 --> 00:04:19,144
for illnesses or wounds that are not very serious

57
00:04:19,144 --> 00:04:23,244
and are men, have been narrowed down to three.

58
00:04:23,244 --> 00:04:25,844
The first one is Mr. Chotaro Shinki,

59
00:04:25,844 --> 00:04:29,644
who was admitted on the 18th for a broken right leg.

60
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,344
Pardon the unclear image

61
00:04:31,344 --> 00:04:34,444
because I rushed to film him in secret.

62
00:04:34,444 --> 00:04:36,444
The 2nd one is Mr. Rikumichi Kusuda

63
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:39,744
who was admitted on the 19th for a sprained neck.

64
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:43,044
And the third is Mr. Chugo Nishiya

65
00:04:43,044 --> 00:04:46,844
who was admitted on the 21st for acute hip pains.

66
00:04:46,844 --> 00:04:48,944
All three men requested private rooms,

67
00:04:48,944 --> 00:04:51,844
and no one seems to have come to visit them.

68
00:04:51,844 --> 00:04:56,644
Which means that they don't know yet that Rena Mizunashi is here,

69
00:04:56,644 --> 00:04:59,644
or that we're sheltering her.

70
00:04:59,644 --> 00:05:00,844
I guess not.

71
00:05:00,844 --> 00:05:02,844
If they already know,

72
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,544
they would have sent in several members

73
00:05:06,544 --> 00:05:08,444
disguised as friends and visitors

74
00:05:08,444 --> 00:05:10,744
to check on the number of FBI agents and our positions.

75
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,444
At any rate, inform the agents

76
00:05:13,444 --> 00:05:16,444
who are guarding Rena Mizunashi's room about this.

77
00:05:16,444 --> 00:05:18,144
Tell them to make sure they know exactly

78
00:05:18,144 --> 00:05:19,744
what the three men look like.

79
00:05:19,744 --> 00:05:21,044
Yes, sir.

80
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:30,944
How's she doing?

81
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:33,244
She's still unconscious.

82
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:36,644
I want you to look at something.

83
00:05:36,644 --> 00:05:38,444
A picture?

84
00:05:38,444 --> 00:05:42,644
Huh? Members of the Organization are in this hospital?

85
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:47,944
Yes, the suspicious ones are these three.

86
00:05:47,944 --> 00:05:50,944
If one of these men approaches this room,

87
00:05:50,944 --> 00:05:52,444
ward him off somehow.

88
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:54,444
Don't ever make the mistake of letting him inside

89
00:05:54,444 --> 00:05:57,444
this room of Sleeping Beauty, okay?

90
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:02,344
"Haido Central Hospital"

91
00:06:05,244 --> 00:06:08,944
If you push the nails of the feet strongly, like so,

92
00:06:08,944 --> 00:06:10,644
and apply painful stimulation.

93
00:06:10,644 --> 00:06:12,344
If the patient is conscious,

94
00:06:12,344 --> 00:06:16,144
she should awaken or frown.

95
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:21,344
It seems to be that she is still in a coma.

96
00:06:21,344 --> 00:06:22,544
I see.

97
00:06:22,544 --> 00:06:24,844
Well, if we perform the brainwave test

98
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:27,344
that is scheduled three days later now,

99
00:06:27,344 --> 00:06:29,644
we can find out for sure, I think.

100
00:06:29,644 --> 00:06:32,044
No, that's enough, doctor.

101
00:06:32,044 --> 00:06:33,644
I'm sorry to have called you out here.

102
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:36,844
I wanted to confirm her condition above all.

103
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:40,644
I would really like to hear why you're so anxious about it but won't,

104
00:06:40,644 --> 00:06:45,644
because you saved me in LA when I was attacked by a mugger,

105
00:06:45,644 --> 00:06:50,444
and I believe that you would never do anything evil.

106
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:55,144
You haven't told him about anything, I see.

107
00:06:55,144 --> 00:06:58,844
No, the only thing he knows is that we're FBI agents,

108
00:06:58,844 --> 00:07:03,244
and that she is a major witness to a certain case.

109
00:07:03,244 --> 00:07:04,644
I just couldn't come out and say that

110
00:07:04,644 --> 00:07:07,144
the famous announcer Rena Mizunashi

111
00:07:07,144 --> 00:07:11,144
is a member of the dangerous Organization we're pursuing

112
00:07:11,144 --> 00:07:14,344
and that her comrade may come in search of her to this hospital

113
00:07:14,344 --> 00:07:17,244
disguised as a patient.

114
00:07:17,244 --> 00:07:20,644
All the more, for his own safety in the future.

115
00:07:20,644 --> 00:07:23,344
How lucky we are that she's still asleep in a coma,

116
00:07:23,344 --> 00:07:26,244
when things could've been worse.

117
00:07:26,244 --> 00:07:29,844
Even if they were to track down this hospital,

118
00:07:29,844 --> 00:07:32,744
it would be too risky trying to take a person

119
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,944
who is unconscious out of here.

120
00:07:34,944 --> 00:07:40,344
No, we've got to make 100% sure that they won't find her,

121
00:07:40,344 --> 00:07:43,244
for the sake of the Hospital Head who offered to cooperate with us too.

122
00:07:43,244 --> 00:07:47,044
Yes, even if he were to know nothing about it,

123
00:07:47,044 --> 00:07:49,344
cooperating to shelter her,

124
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:52,444
would make him a target of the Organization.

125
00:07:52,444 --> 00:07:56,644
The problem is how do we find out which of the three men

126
00:07:56,644 --> 00:08:01,144
is the one from the Organization that's hiding here.

127
00:08:01,144 --> 00:08:03,244
If I were to do things my way, I would take all three of them

128
00:08:03,244 --> 00:08:07,444
to another hospital and torture them to death.

129
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:09,344
This is Japan.

130
00:08:09,344 --> 00:08:11,444
Besides, we couldn't possibly do something like that

131
00:08:11,444 --> 00:08:12,944
when we've snuck in here ourselves

132
00:08:12,944 --> 00:08:14,744
without informing the Japanese police force.

133
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:19,244
Moreover, two of the three are innocent ordinary patients.

134
00:08:19,244 --> 00:08:23,444
If we approach the suspects carelessly,

135
00:08:23,444 --> 00:08:26,644
the Organization will surely figure out that we're FBI agents

136
00:08:26,644 --> 00:08:29,844
and there's a danger of them finding out that she is in this hospital.

137
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:31,944
Then!

138
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,744
Why don't we try using the good method that I thought up?

139
00:08:34,744 --> 00:08:36,944
Huh? A good method?

140
00:08:36,944 --> 00:08:38,444
I'll tell you about it

141
00:08:38,444 --> 00:08:41,744
after we leave this room and go to another room.

142
00:08:41,744 --> 00:08:44,944
With two foreign looking people and a man with evil looking eyes

143
00:08:44,944 --> 00:08:46,844
going out of this room at once,

144
00:08:46,844 --> 00:08:48,244
because you all stand out, if someone sees you,

145
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:51,344
rumor will spread fast!

146
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:53,644
There's no one in the corridor now.

147
00:08:53,644 --> 00:08:55,244
Okay.

148
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:57,044
Let's change rooms!

149
00:08:58,944 --> 00:09:00,844
Oh, please come too.

150
00:09:00,844 --> 00:09:02,544
Huh, me too?

151
00:09:02,544 --> 00:09:05,544
I want you to hear about it too.

152
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:07,544
It'll only take a minute!

153
00:09:08,644 --> 00:09:10,144
Come, quick,

154
00:09:10,144 --> 00:09:11,744
quick.

155
00:09:14,644 --> 00:09:16,344
Huh?

156
00:09:16,344 --> 00:09:18,444
I forgot something!

157
00:09:18,444 --> 00:09:20,944
Wait here, I'll go get it!

158
00:09:29,544 --> 00:09:32,144
And, did you get what you forgot?

159
00:09:32,144 --> 00:09:34,244
Oh, no.

160
00:09:34,244 --> 00:09:36,644
I seem to have made a mistake!

161
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,244
I'm sorry!

162
00:09:45,944 --> 00:09:49,044
Will you go back to the room after all, sir?

163
00:09:49,044 --> 00:09:50,244
Huh?

164
00:09:50,244 --> 00:09:52,344
Because we'll be in big trouble

165
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:55,344
if that announcer suddenly gets up, you see.

166
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:08,895
You're going to listen to what the three men have to say?

167
00:10:08,895 --> 00:10:09,895
Alone?

168
00:10:09,895 --> 00:10:12,595
Unless I'm alone, they'll figure things out right away.

169
00:10:12,595 --> 00:10:15,095
Being a child, I'm pretty sure the man

170
00:10:15,095 --> 00:10:17,295
that's a member of the evil Organization will be off his guard!

171
00:10:17,295 --> 00:10:20,895
It may be true, that even they wouldn't expect you

172
00:10:20,895 --> 00:10:23,095
to be as sharp as you are but,

173
00:10:23,095 --> 00:10:26,095
I wonder about whether we can all trust you alone,

174
00:10:26,095 --> 00:10:28,995
to judge which of the men are from the Organization.

175
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,595
It's not going to be only me.

176
00:10:30,595 --> 00:10:33,595
I'm going to have all the FBI members think with me!

177
00:10:33,595 --> 00:10:35,195
I'm going to have you all check

178
00:10:35,195 --> 00:10:37,395
the image and sound on the video camera

179
00:10:37,395 --> 00:10:39,795
that I'll secretly set up on myself.

180
00:10:39,795 --> 00:10:42,095
I think it would be better to hear them out

181
00:10:42,095 --> 00:10:44,395
while you give me instructions, but...

182
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:48,695
You don't want waves that will be harmful to medical devices.

183
00:10:48,695 --> 00:10:49,995
Hey, sonny.

184
00:10:49,995 --> 00:10:52,395
I hope you're ready for what you're jumping into.

185
00:10:52,395 --> 00:10:54,595
Doing what you're planning to do,

186
00:10:54,595 --> 00:10:57,695
the guys are going to know what you look like whether you like it or not.

187
00:10:57,695 --> 00:11:00,995
They'll see you as our dog who cooperated with us.

188
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:04,295
If that happens, the sparks of fire

189
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:06,995
will not only shower on you.

190
00:11:06,995 --> 00:11:10,795
I'm in the same boat as the head of the hospital we saw a while ago.

191
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:15,095
I have trust in you FBI agents!

192
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:17,895
I know that you'll catch the bad guys

193
00:11:17,895 --> 00:11:20,795
and never let them get away!

194
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:27,495
Okay, are you ready?

195
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:32,195
I set the mic and camera in the right collar of your jacket.

196
00:11:32,195 --> 00:11:34,495
If they should ever find out...

197
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:38,395
Shout aloud and you will come and rescue me, right?

198
00:11:38,395 --> 00:11:39,595
Yes.

199
00:11:39,595 --> 00:11:43,495
Then, let's start with Mr. Chugo Nishiya.

200
00:11:49,195 --> 00:11:52,895
Hey, you're the boy staying at Mr. Mouri's place?

201
00:11:52,895 --> 00:11:55,595
Just what're you doing here?

202
00:11:55,595 --> 00:11:57,395
Nakamichi of the soccer club?

203
00:11:57,395 --> 00:11:59,095
Huh? Do you know them?

204
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:00,795
No!

205
00:12:00,795 --> 00:12:02,895
I came to visit my friend and got lost,

206
00:12:02,895 --> 00:12:04,995
so I was just asking them for directions!

207
00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:08,195
What happened to your head, Nakamichi?

208
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:10,195
Oh, this?

209
00:12:10,195 --> 00:12:13,695
I got hit on the head and passed out during club practice.

210
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:16,195
I thought I was fine,

211
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:17,995
but the doctor said that he wanted to give me a detailed examination

212
00:12:17,995 --> 00:12:20,495
so I'm being hospitalized for a few days.

213
00:12:20,495 --> 00:12:24,395
It's because you try to act cool and do overhead shots!

214
00:12:26,095 --> 00:12:28,595
Hey, how do you know something like that?

215
00:12:28,595 --> 00:12:32,095
Oh, well, Shinichi used to always tell me about it.

216
00:12:32,095 --> 00:12:33,795
I mean, is there anything else that could happen to you

217
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,695
when you hit your head?

218
00:12:35,695 --> 00:12:38,795
By the way, did you see Eisuke anywhere?

219
00:12:38,795 --> 00:12:41,495
He seems to have come to this hospital.

220
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:44,795
No, I haven't seen him.

221
00:12:44,795 --> 00:12:47,595
I was admitted to the hospital four days ago.

222
00:12:47,595 --> 00:12:49,895
Eisuke Aizawa of the soccer club

223
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,895
came to see me as soon as I was admitted here, though.

224
00:12:51,895 --> 00:12:53,795
I see.

225
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:03,995
It seems he somehow finished taking images of all three men.

226
00:13:03,995 --> 00:13:05,595
Good work, Conan.

227
00:13:05,595 --> 00:13:06,795
Yep!

228
00:13:06,795 --> 00:13:09,295
Okay, let's take a look at it then.

229
00:13:09,295 --> 00:13:11,395
First, let's start with Mr. Nishiya

230
00:13:11,395 --> 00:13:13,795
who was hospitalized for acute hip pains.

231
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,295
Hey, kid.

232
00:13:17,295 --> 00:13:18,795
What do you think you're doing in my room?

233
00:13:18,795 --> 00:13:21,895
Oh, I'm sorry, wrong room!

234
00:13:23,195 --> 00:13:25,595
You fell?

235
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:28,595
Well, just watch!

236
00:13:28,595 --> 00:13:30,295
Hey, kid?

237
00:13:31,195 --> 00:13:34,895
Oh, can you pick my cell phone up for me?

238
00:13:34,895 --> 00:13:38,195
Oh, boy.

239
00:13:45,795 --> 00:13:49,695
Here! It's a little sticky but sorry!

240
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,195
I've got greasy skin.

241
00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:52,695
Thank you!

242
00:13:52,695 --> 00:13:56,895
Sir, do you know how to make calls on the cell phone?

243
00:13:57,995 --> 00:13:59,195
Come to think of it,

244
00:13:59,195 --> 00:14:02,895
the guy of the Organization was e-mailing the boss.

245
00:14:04,395 --> 00:14:06,895
I'm sorry, but I'm not a digital person,

246
00:14:06,895 --> 00:14:08,695
so I don't know a thing about it.

247
00:14:08,695 --> 00:14:11,595
Oh, I see, maybe...

248
00:14:11,595 --> 00:14:13,195
What're you doing?

249
00:14:13,195 --> 00:14:16,595
Maybe it's because the curtains are closed.

250
00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:18,195
That's why if I go like this,

251
00:14:18,195 --> 00:14:20,095
I can put some electric waves in here!

252
00:14:20,095 --> 00:14:24,095
Idiot, all you're doing is causing dust to fly all over the place.

253
00:14:25,895 --> 00:14:28,095
Oops, sorry!

254
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,195
So, if you're done with your business, get on out of here!

255
00:14:31,195 --> 00:14:33,395
Hurry before I lose my temper.

256
00:14:33,395 --> 00:14:34,795
Okay.

257
00:14:35,495 --> 00:14:37,195
Next is Mr. Rikumichi Kusuda

258
00:14:37,195 --> 00:14:40,295
who was hospitalized for a sprained neck.

259
00:14:50,795 --> 00:14:52,295
Ouch.

260
00:14:52,295 --> 00:14:56,195
What's with you dashing in like that and then falling over nothing?

261
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:59,095
-Who're you? -I'm sorry.

262
00:14:59,095 --> 00:15:01,895
I came into the wrong room.

263
00:15:01,895 --> 00:15:04,495
I'm sorry, but will you pick that up for me?

264
00:15:04,495 --> 00:15:07,295
Give me a break.

265
00:15:07,295 --> 00:15:09,095
You mean this cell phone?

266
00:15:09,095 --> 00:15:10,695
Used the same method to get in?

267
00:15:10,695 --> 00:15:13,195
I couldn't think of any other way.

268
00:15:13,195 --> 00:15:16,095
Darn, I have a sore neck, you know!

269
00:15:17,595 --> 00:15:19,095
Here.

270
00:15:19,095 --> 00:15:22,595
Huh? What's with you snooping around here and there?

271
00:15:22,595 --> 00:15:27,595
I'm sorry! Your profile looks familiar!

272
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:28,695
Oh, right!

273
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:31,195
Do you know how to use the cell phone?

274
00:15:31,195 --> 00:15:33,795
I can't get through no matter how many times I try.

275
00:15:33,795 --> 00:15:35,695
Yeah, I do.

276
00:15:35,695 --> 00:15:37,395
You don't know how to use it?

277
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:40,395
You can't use the cell phone in the hospital...

278
00:15:40,395 --> 00:15:43,095
I mean this phone doesn't even have a battery in it!

279
00:15:43,095 --> 00:15:46,295
Oh, I see. I dropped the cell phone before coming here,

280
00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:48,995
so it may have come out then.

281
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:51,895
Well, you like canned coffee, don't you?

282
00:15:51,895 --> 00:15:55,995
Yeah. I already drank one today too.

283
00:15:55,995 --> 00:15:58,395
Hey, you! What do you think you're doing?

284
00:15:58,395 --> 00:16:02,095
I'm sorry, I was trying to see what kind there are but my hand got stuck.

285
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:04,495
I'll put them back right away!

286
00:16:08,195 --> 00:16:13,395
Last, there's Mr. Chotaro Shinki who broke his right leg.

287
00:16:13,395 --> 00:16:16,395
Huh? Pick that up?

288
00:16:16,395 --> 00:16:17,695
Darn, I can't see how you can ask an old man like me

289
00:16:17,695 --> 00:16:19,295
who has a broken leg to do something like that.

290
00:16:19,295 --> 00:16:22,295
Huh? This is a cell phone!

291
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:23,995
Pick it up yourself then!

292
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:25,895
Huh, why?

293
00:16:25,895 --> 00:16:29,595
I hate insects and cell phones!

294
00:16:30,395 --> 00:16:31,895
Talking of insects...

295
00:16:31,895 --> 00:16:36,495
There's something by your left collar!

296
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,395
Isn't that a spider?

297
00:16:38,395 --> 00:16:40,095
Spider?

298
00:16:40,095 --> 00:16:41,595
What?

299
00:16:41,595 --> 00:16:43,695
Where is it?

300
00:16:47,795 --> 00:16:49,495
Brat, I get it.

301
00:16:49,495 --> 00:16:52,595
You were asked to come here and check on me, right?

302
00:16:53,495 --> 00:16:55,195
He stood up.

303
00:16:55,195 --> 00:17:00,395
Tell the doctor that sent you here that my legs aren't cured yet,

304
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:03,695
and don't plan on being X-rayed because it's bad for my body.

305
00:17:03,695 --> 00:17:06,895
Tell him that all I want is a medical certificate!

306
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:10,495
Now that you know, get out of here right this minute!

307
00:17:13,195 --> 00:17:16,595
It looks as though all three of them are feigning it pretty well.

308
00:17:16,595 --> 00:17:21,195
Yeah. We're probably going to have to watch them for a while.

309
00:17:21,195 --> 00:17:25,495
No. All we need to do is watch one of them.

310
00:17:25,495 --> 00:17:28,495
Right, sonny?

311
00:17:28,495 --> 00:17:29,495
Yep!

312
00:17:34,295 --> 00:17:36,195
Hey, Shu.

313
00:17:36,195 --> 00:17:38,095
Are you sure that there's only one

314
00:17:38,095 --> 00:17:40,495
suspect that we need to watch?

315
00:17:40,495 --> 00:17:41,995
Yeah.

316
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:44,495
This boy here found him for us.

317
00:17:44,495 --> 00:17:47,595
He pointed out exactly who the guy is for us.

318
00:17:47,595 --> 00:17:49,695
What do you mean he found the suspect?

319
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:51,295
I don't mean to offend Conan but,

320
00:17:51,295 --> 00:17:52,895
he fell in front of all three of them

321
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,895
and made them pick up his cell phone.

322
00:17:54,895 --> 00:17:57,295
After checking if the suspects could use the cell phone,

323
00:17:57,295 --> 00:17:59,595
he ran around the room messed it up

324
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:01,995
and got them angry!

325
00:18:03,595 --> 00:18:06,595
Just how could you specify who the guy is with just that?

326
00:18:06,595 --> 00:18:10,095
It's true that there was only one man

327
00:18:10,095 --> 00:18:13,895
who said he knew how to use the cell phone.

328
00:18:13,895 --> 00:18:15,795
If the guy is a member of the Organization,

329
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:18,795
wouldn't it be more probable for him to say, "I can't use the cell phone."

330
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:22,695
Just like Mr. Nishiya who said he was not a digital person.

331
00:18:22,695 --> 00:18:24,995
No, the guy who was admitted to the hospital

332
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:28,195
because of acute hip pains is not the one.

333
00:18:28,195 --> 00:18:33,895
A guy whose purpose is to look for Rena Mizunashi and hiding,

334
00:18:33,895 --> 00:18:37,695
can't possibly be hospitalized suffering from hip pains all this time.

335
00:18:39,095 --> 00:18:42,295
Moreover, when the boy opened and closed the curtains

336
00:18:42,295 --> 00:18:44,095
and produced dust,

337
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:48,195
he pinched his nose and tried to hold back sneezing,

338
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:49,495
but couldn't.

339
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:52,295
In other words, he was afraid that

340
00:18:52,295 --> 00:18:54,395
sneezing would cause pain to run through his body,

341
00:18:54,395 --> 00:18:57,495
so he tried to sneeze by letting air out through his mouth.

342
00:18:57,495 --> 00:18:59,795
Because if he were to sneeze in the normal way,

343
00:18:59,795 --> 00:19:01,995
pain is sure to flash through his hips.

344
00:19:01,995 --> 00:19:06,095
Yes, I usually do so when I feel like sneezing in public,

345
00:19:06,095 --> 00:19:09,095
but maybe he's just trying to make it look that way.

346
00:19:09,095 --> 00:19:10,795
The only one in that room back then,

347
00:19:10,795 --> 00:19:13,195
was this boy that he didn't know at all.

348
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:16,595
He had no reason to hold back on sneezing.

349
00:19:16,595 --> 00:19:19,995
If he suspected the boy, he would've chased him out of the room

350
00:19:19,995 --> 00:19:24,695
before picking up the cell phone and putting his fingerprints on it.

351
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:27,095
I see, so the member of the Organization

352
00:19:27,095 --> 00:19:28,495
is pretending to be hurt, in order to stay hospitalized

353
00:19:28,495 --> 00:19:30,495
for an extended period of time.

354
00:19:30,495 --> 00:19:32,695
Yes, I don't know what his condition was upon hospitalization,

355
00:19:32,695 --> 00:19:36,095
but I'm sure he's fully recovered by now.

356
00:19:36,095 --> 00:19:38,295
Come to think of it, Mr. Shinki,

357
00:19:38,295 --> 00:19:40,995
he stood up on his injured right leg.

358
00:19:40,995 --> 00:19:45,195
Yeah. The leg of that old man is already cured.

359
00:19:45,195 --> 00:19:47,895
Mr. Kusuda who is being hospitalized for a sprained neck

360
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,095
is also cured already, isn't he?

361
00:19:50,095 --> 00:19:53,195
In order to look for Conan who kept disappearing from his sight,

362
00:19:53,195 --> 00:19:54,695
he had to look all over the room.

363
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:55,995
But he did so with ease.

364
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:58,195
If his neck isn't cured yet,

365
00:19:58,195 --> 00:20:01,395
he'd have to move his entire body around to do what he did.

366
00:20:01,395 --> 00:20:04,995
He also drank up his canned coffee.

367
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,495
Canned coffee?

368
00:20:07,495 --> 00:20:10,495
Well, when drinking out of a can,

369
00:20:10,495 --> 00:20:12,095
you have to lurch your neck backwards and look up

370
00:20:12,095 --> 00:20:13,595
or you can't drink all of what's inside, right?

371
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:15,795
But, when I knocked the cans of coffee

372
00:20:15,795 --> 00:20:17,395
that he drank out of on the floor,

373
00:20:17,395 --> 00:20:19,995
nothing spilled out!

374
00:20:19,995 --> 00:20:21,495
They were all empty!

375
00:20:21,495 --> 00:20:24,995
That means he drank it all, right?

376
00:20:24,995 --> 00:20:28,995
He said that he also drank some just a while ago,

377
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:31,195
so it's not that the contents dried out, right?

378
00:20:31,195 --> 00:20:33,695
Which means that two of them are pretending to be hurt.

379
00:20:33,695 --> 00:20:36,295
Then what's the other man who seems to have nothing to do

380
00:20:36,295 --> 00:20:38,795
with the Organization after?

381
00:20:38,795 --> 00:20:42,895
He's probably after "Hospitalization Insurance", that old man.

382
00:20:42,895 --> 00:20:44,095
What?

383
00:20:44,095 --> 00:20:48,795
There is an insurance bonus for being hospitalized more than 20 days.

384
00:20:48,795 --> 00:20:50,595
That's why he's refusing to get an X-Ray

385
00:20:50,595 --> 00:20:53,895
and wants to hide the fact that he is already recovered.

386
00:20:53,895 --> 00:20:58,695
In other words, his purpose is insurance money.

387
00:20:58,695 --> 00:21:02,495
But, he could just be making it look that way on purpose, right?

388
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:07,995
Right, that old man did think that the doctor sent Conan to him.

389
00:21:07,995 --> 00:21:10,095
And if the fact that he's recovered comes to light,

390
00:21:10,095 --> 00:21:11,395
he's probably going to make it look like

391
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,295
he was after the insurance money.

392
00:21:13,295 --> 00:21:16,195
Right, and that old man

393
00:21:16,195 --> 00:21:19,095
was the only one who didn't even bother to touch the cell phone.

394
00:21:19,095 --> 00:21:22,795
I hate insects and cell phones!

395
00:21:22,795 --> 00:21:23,895
Isn't he suspicious?

396
00:21:23,895 --> 00:21:26,495
It's only natural that he couldn't touch it.

397
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:31,395
He was wearing a pace maker, the thing to help his heart work!

398
00:21:31,395 --> 00:21:34,495
Going near a cell phone that emits waves

399
00:21:34,495 --> 00:21:36,595
can be life threatening to him.

400
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,195
Well, I didn't have any battery in that cell phone

401
00:21:39,195 --> 00:21:40,695
to begin with, though.

402
00:21:40,695 --> 00:21:44,995
But, how did you know that the old man had a pace maker on him?

403
00:21:44,995 --> 00:21:48,495
Remember, below the left collar bone of that old man,

404
00:21:48,495 --> 00:21:51,595
there was a protruded area with a trace of a wound, right?

405
00:21:51,595 --> 00:21:53,495
That's the trace of the wound that he had surgery for

406
00:21:53,495 --> 00:21:55,095
when implanting the pace maker!

407
00:21:55,095 --> 00:21:58,095
Then, you lied telling him that there was an insect by his collar,

408
00:21:58,095 --> 00:22:00,495
not to make him stand up but...

409
00:22:00,495 --> 00:22:03,595
to confirm whether he had a pace maker on him!

410
00:22:03,595 --> 00:22:04,995
Yep.

411
00:22:06,395 --> 00:22:07,595
I see.

412
00:22:07,595 --> 00:22:09,495
So that old man who wouldn't be able

413
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,995
to e-mail the boss of the Organization

414
00:22:11,995 --> 00:22:14,795
with his cell phone is marked off.

415
00:22:14,795 --> 00:22:17,695
Yes. The only one left is probably

416
00:22:17,695 --> 00:22:19,795
the man with the sprained neck

417
00:22:19,795 --> 00:22:22,995
who's pretending to have faint spells and nausea from the wound

418
00:22:22,995 --> 00:22:26,495
and is extending his duration of hospitalization,

419
00:22:26,495 --> 00:22:28,795
Rikumichi Kusuda.

420
00:22:28,795 --> 00:22:30,495
There's only him.

421
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,440
Next Conan's Hint:

422
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,600
Akemi Miyano.

423
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,900
You people, go on and disclose the identity of the Organization!

424
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,940
Oh, right-on, right-on.
