1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,870
What lies in one's heart is a mystery to us all.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,870
Star and snow glitter on the two.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,770
Ayumi's idea breaks the code.

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,670
Who is the person full of mystery?

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,270
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,170
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,070
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,530
The gang and I went to see "Paul and Annie's Animal Show".

9
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,830
After the show, we went outside

10
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,330
and saw a man named James Black in trouble

11
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,430
having been mistaken for someone else so we went to his rescue.

12
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,130
Later, Mr. Black went to get his car

13
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,830
to take us to a restaurant

14
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,830
but he simply disappeared.

15
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,430
Leaving behind his blood stained strap.

16
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:30,430
"The Man From Chicago (Part 2)"

17
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,530
P and A?

18
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,830
What does it mean?

19
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,930
It was on the ground.

20
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,730
I'm sure it's a message from Mr. Black

21
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,330
telling us about the kidnappers.

22
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,230
Look! There's blood on the P and the & and the A.

23
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,430
Well, for now...

24
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,330
We'll take back to the station

25
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,930
and check to see if it's real blood.

26
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,630
Come back to the police box tomorrow.

27
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,230
Hey!

28
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:12,630
Gosh. If we only knew what he meant by that P and A...

29
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,730
Maybe he meant P and A together, to make "pa".

30
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,930
Maybe he meant the name of a shop?

31
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,230
You know, like "panya" (bakery).

32
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,830
No.

33
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,130
If he was in trouble and he wanted to get "pa" across,

34
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,630
he'd have smeared blood on the "Pa" in Paul.

35
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,730
I think we should think of the P and the A separately.

36
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,530
P and A...

37
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,130
Pink and Aka (red)...

38
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,230
Pro wrestling, anpan (bread filled with bean jam).

39
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,330
Personal computer, access...

40
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,730
Pistol and assassin.

41
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,230
Come on.

42
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,530
Maybe he meant parking area!

43
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,330
A parking lot!

44
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,530
But we don't know which parking lot.

45
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,730
Wait until I finish.

46
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,330
Maybe he was trying to tell us

47
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,930
he left a clue at the parking lot his car was parked.

48
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,130
Yes. I thought the same thing

49
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,530
so I checked the place out but I didn't find anything.

50
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,030
I see.

51
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,630
Gosh. I just can't figure it out.

52
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,130
I guess we don't have any other choice

53
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,730
except to ask around this neighborhood

54
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,730
with the assumption they're still in the area.

55
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,130
All right! Let's all split up

56
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,630
and ask around the neighborhood

57
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,230
to see if anyone saw two men take a foreigner away.

58
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,430
If you learn something,

59
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,530
contact the others with your badge.

60
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,230
Okay...

61
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,030
-Huh? -What's wrong, Ayumi?

62
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,130
I can't find my badge.

63
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,030
You're kidding.

64
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,330
Maybe you dropped it someplace.

65
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,230
I don't understand.

66
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,330
It was here when I showed it Mr. Black.

67
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,130
Oh, Sherlock Holmes!

68
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,630
I think Mr. Black might still have my badge.

69
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,030
-What? -Are you sure?

70
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,230
Yes, pretty sure.

71
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,330
Then the transmitter built inside it

72
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,730
will give us his location.

73
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,830
There they are!

74
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,530
16 kilometers northwest from here.

75
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,030
They're moving north

76
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,630
along Temuzu Rivers and Ikumo Highway

77
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,330
judging by the speed, they're in a car.

78
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,230
They're in a car?

79
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,730
On the Ikumo Highway?

80
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,230
Heading north?

81
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,930
All set. Now that we know that much.

82
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,630
What?

83
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,730
You want me to put up a roadblock

84
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:43,930
on Ikumo Highway at the Saitama border?

85
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,230
You're asking me to do the impossible, Conan.

86
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,730
I can't order a roadblock

87
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,230
on unsubstantiated information like that.

88
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,930
But that man might get killed if you don't.

89
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,830
But nonetheless...

90
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,430
Conan, is that you? This is Sato.

91
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,130
There was a traffic accident in that area just now,

92
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,230
and Yumi is handling the traffic.

93
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,930
I can ask her to check for suspicious cars.

94
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,130
That shouldn't be any problem.

95
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,630
Height, 180.

96
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,330
An American of English descent about 50 to 60 years old,

97
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,030
beard and glasses.

98
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,930
Look for the car he's in, right?

99
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,830
Got it. I'll tell her to stop the car if she sees it.

100
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,330
What? The kidnappers might be armed?

101
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,230
Yes, okay.

102
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:34,330
Don't worry. Takagi and I will go there right now.

103
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,330
What? Me, too?

104
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,930
What's the big deal?

105
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,730
We've got nothing to do until later tonight.

106
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,830
Besides, whenever that kid gets involved,

107
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,930
things get interesting.

108
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,130
Okay. We're heading there too.

109
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,630
Dr. Agasa, please bring the car around.

110
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,630
After all, we're the only ones who can identify Mr. Black.

111
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,230
All right, I understand!

112
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,130
Listen. Doesn't something strike you as odd?

113
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:12,130
Mr. Black was brought here through the alley by two men

114
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,730
and then transferred into another car.

115
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,230
it would mean he had to cut himself on the finger

116
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,830
and leave the blood code

117
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,830
while he was walking through the alley, isnt that right?

118
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,930
Yes.

119
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,230
I guess so, the man must have threatened him with a gun

120
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,630
while he was in the parking lot.

121
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,630
He must've put the blood on the strap

122
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,130
when they weren't watching.

123
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,030
Or maybe he went with them willingly

124
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,830
knowing full well they were up to no good

125
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,530
and left us that message.

126
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:42,130
What're you trying to say?

127
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,630
I feel something.

128
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,030
Like something's calling me.

129
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,130
Aren't you over reacting?

130
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,630
I hope you're right.

131
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,630
Hey! Did you see that?

132
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,030
Did you see who was driving that car?

133
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,730
No. It went by too fast.

134
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,630
Is that so?

135
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:42,130
A foreigner...

136
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,030
Let's see.

137
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,530
No.

138
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,630
A foreigner...

139
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,330
A foreigner.

140
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,630
Let's see.

141
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,730
Excuse me.

142
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:58,730
Yes?

143
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,330
I hate to ask, but could you let us through?

144
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,730
We've got to get this guy

145
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,230
on the scene investigation done by sundown.

146
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,830
So, you're working a case.

147
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,230
Yes, nothing major. The guy's small time.

148
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,130
He wrecked his girlfriend's house, that's all.

149
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,630
No problem. Go on ahead.

150
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,330
We really appreciate this.

151
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,630
Where was I?

152
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,630
Look for a foreigner. A foreigner.

153
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,230
What? You didn't see them?

154
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,630
-Are you sure? -You know he's a foreigner?

155
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,030
Yes. I didn't see a single foreigner.

156
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,330
What do you think happened, Conan?

157
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,930
Where is the car now?

158
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,430
They're on the move about 8 kilometers from here

159
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,830
but my batteries are running low.

160
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,330
I don't get it though.

161
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,830
How'd they get past this roadblock?

162
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,730
If that guy's got one of our badges,

163
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,630
all we have to do is ask him where he is.

164
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:07,130
No. The kidnappers will hear us beeping him.

165
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:10,930
I guess we have to figure out what that P and A means.

166
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,030
There's a possibility

167
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:15,230
that it's referring to where they're headed.

168
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,030
I've got it! Parfait and anmitsu (jelly like dessert).

169
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,830
So maybe a restaurant!

170
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:23,630
How about perm and afro referring to a beauty salon?

171
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:27,130
Can't you guys think a little more seriously?

172
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,230
How about this then?

173
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,930
Pelican and ashika (seal) for zoo?

174
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,730
You know, since Mr. Black likes animals.

175
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,330
You're wrong. If he meant zoo,

176
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,330
he'd have put blood on the word "animal"

177
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,730
on the title "Animal Show".

178
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,630
I see! So that's what it was!

179
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,630
Nice going, Ayumi!

180
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,930
What?

181
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,530
I've figured it out.

182
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,730
I know where Mr. Black is.

183
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,430
What?

184
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,130
The kidnappers are...

185
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,430
in a police car?

186
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,630
I don't believe it. It can't be.

187
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,630
It's true!

188
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:10,430
If we don't go after them before it get dark, we'll lose them.

189
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,430
Yumi. What happened?

190
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,630
Did you get the kidnappers Conan was telling us about?

191
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,530
So, where are the kidnappers?

192
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:25,230
Well... they're saying that the men are in a police car.

193
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,730
What?

194
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,230
Yes.

195
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,330
-A police car? -That's right.

196
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:35,530
The message Mr. Black for us, the P and A,

197
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,930
it stands for police car.

198
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,730
I still don't understand. Why does P and A stand for police car?

199
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:46,530
Take the "and" symbol, spell it out and connect to the P and A.

200
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:50,630
Let's see. P and A...

201
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,930
P And A...

202
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,730
Panda?

203
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,130
That's it, panda!

204
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:02,430
I see! A police car is black and white.

205
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,530
The same as a panda! I get it.

206
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,530
Conan, you're so smart!

207
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,730
I see what you mean.

208
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,130
There are some police officers in Japan

209
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,230
that refer to the police cars as pandas.

210
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,830
but didn't you say the victim is an American of English descent?

211
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,830
It's hard to imagine a foreigner would know

212
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,530
jargon Japanese police officers use.

213
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,130
And besides, it doesn't necessarily have to be a police car,

214
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,130
it could be a round, white car with black tires and rims

215
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,730
that would make you think of a panda too, wouldn't it?

216
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,130
Maybe.

217
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,130
In fact, that would be more panda-like

218
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,830
to a foreigner than a police car.

219
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:40,630
No. The victim James Black was raised in London,

220
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,730
that's why he would visualize a panda.

221
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,230
-What? -A long time ago,

222
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,330
police cars in England were painted black and white too.

223
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,330
-What? -In 1965,

224
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,130
the police department in Lancaster, England

225
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,830
was the first to paint black and white

226
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,230
and they gave them the nickname panda.

227
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,030
The nickname stuck and in England,

228
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:02,030
police cars are known as pandas.

229
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:05,230
The word "panda car" is even listed in the English dictionary.

230
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,830
I don't think the younger generation would know that though,

231
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,830
but Mr. James's generation

232
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:17,230
would immediately associate police car with panda.

233
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,230
I see.

234
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,930
What generation are you, anyway?

235
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,430
I just remembered.

236
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,830
I let a police car go through without checking it.

237
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:27,930
What?

238
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:31,330
But I don't think there was a foreigner inside.

239
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,030
The officer in the car. Didn't he seem strange?

240
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,530
Let's see. There were two detectives,

241
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,730
the suspect was in the back seat sitting between them,

242
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,530
his head was covered with a coat...

243
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,330
That's them!

244
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,490
That was so easy! So easy!

245
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,990
We're right on schedule.

246
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,190
We'll be deep in the mountains of Gunma by nightfall.

247
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,190
You were right. Your plan's working out perfect.

248
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,690
We can't let our guard down yet.

249
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,790
Didn't you think it was strange?

250
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,790
That female cop was just supposed to be directing traffic

251
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,290
but she looked into each and every car.

252
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:26,790
Hey, don't tell me that the cops are already on to us?

253
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,790
There's nothing to worry about.

254
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,990
We've got a hostage.

255
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,490
We've got to be prepared for anything

256
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,890
so keep your gun pressed to this guys throat.

257
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:39,190
And if they set up another roadblock or something...

258
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,690
We're going to crash our way through.

259
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:03,290
Hey, Sato. We're going to be in big trouble.

260
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,090
We've entered Saitama prefecture.

261
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,890
We've already asked the Saitama police to set up a roadblock.

262
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,890
So we don't have to keep going after them.

263
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,890
-Aren't you worried, Takagi? -Huh?

264
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,190
Yumi's checked that police car once.

265
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,990
They might have figured out already

266
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,790
that their cover's been blown

267
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,890
so they might use their hostage as a shield

268
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,390
and break through the roadblock.

269
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,790
Another thing. When Yumi looked inside,

270
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,890
she said the hostage didn't move at all.

271
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:36,190
So there's a high possibility the kidnappers are armed.

272
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,690
Wait a minute!

273
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,490
If they have guns and they see a roadblock,

274
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:45,090
they might start shooting at everything in sight.

275
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,890
The city's going to be in a panic!

276
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,090
That's why I've been trying to think up a plan

277
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,090
where we can surround the kidnappers without them knowing

278
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,590
and then take them in.

279
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:00,090
But then we'd need a miracle.

280
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,290
I think there's a way.

281
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,090
What? Conan?

282
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,390
The kids detective badge?

283
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:10,790
Sorry! I put it in your car when you weren't looking.

284
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,190
And where are you now?

285
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:16,490
About 500 meters behind your car.

286
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:20,790
So how? I've got a great plan, do you want to try it?

287
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,090
The only thing is this plan will work

288
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,090
only if a lot of other police officers

289
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:29,090
go along with my crazy idea.

290
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,290
Good grief. What's the matter with me?

291
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,590
What am I doing way out here?

292
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,290
Yumi? You following me?

293
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,890
Yes, I am. Do I have a choice?

294
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:47,190
I mean, I made a mistake and let those kidnappers get away.

295
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,790
Yumi, weren't you in charge of all the arrangements

296
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,290
when we had that get together with the Saitama police the other time?

297
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:55,290
What? Yes, I was.

298
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,590
Gosh! Another red light!

299
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,690
Don't get impatient. Just drive normally

300
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,590
and we won't draw any attention to ourselves.

301
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,690
We'll be safe once it gets dark.

302
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,790
Oh, crap! It's the cops!

303
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,490
I guess they're on to us!

304
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,790
Come on! Get going!

305
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,690
We'll make a run for it, we'll use him as a cover!

306
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,090
Yeah, okay!

307
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,090
Help me!

308
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,690
What's going on?

309
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,990
-Officer! -Please help us!

310
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,290
Excuse me! I'm Takagi from headquarters!

311
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,490
Please help us apprehend that kidnapper!

312
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,090
Gosh. Don't make a sound.

313
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,290
All right. We'll go along with them for a little while

314
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,790
then turn off into a side road when the coast's clear!

315
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,290
Got you!

316
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,890
Good. They fell for it!

317
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,990
Well? Is it working?

318
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,390
Just fine! It's going just fine!

319
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,690
Don't worry about it.

320
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,790
Get ready.

321
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,690
We're going to turn into a side road soon.

322
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,390
Hey! Why are you going so slow?

323
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,590
They're going to get away!

324
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,890
If you can't turn left, turn into the right!

325
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,690
But...

326
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,890
there's another one on the right.

327
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,390
All right then, we'll go back!

328
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,790
Slow down and then back up.

329
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,590
It's no good.

330
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,590
There's another one behind us too.

331
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,090
What?

332
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:53,790
Hey! We're completely surrounded by cops!

333
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,590
Darn it!

334
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:00,990
Nice going, Irregulars.

335
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,490
Or should I say "Holmes"?

336
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,590
Darn the cops! They set us up!

337
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,990
Never mind. We've got a hostage.

338
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,890
It's no use.

339
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,390
When someone gives the signal,

340
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:21,790
all the cars will stop at once.

341
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:30,990
By the time, the kidnappers regain their balance.

342
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,290
Put your hands up!

343
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,190
Your method was a little rough,

344
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,990
but it worked out perfect.

345
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,290
You're a real cool guy.

346
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,090
I want to thank all of you! You really helped us out!

347
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,890
Don't mention it! This was an easy job!

348
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,890
By the way, about our next get together...

349
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:55,890
I'll handle it!

350
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,890
I'll round up all the pretty single ones from headquarters.

351
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:02,190
I don't care, as long as Miss Sato's there...

352
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,790
Me, too.

353
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,290
I see.

354
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,890
Hey, Yumi.

355
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:09,790
Where's the victim, James Black?

356
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,590
Huh? He was right here just awhile ago.

357
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,490
Where'd he go?

358
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,290
I knew something was strange about that guy.

359
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,890
He disappeared before the police could question him.

360
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,890
I just know there's something behind this.

361
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,290
You think so?

362
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,590
He seemed like a pretty nice guy to me.

363
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,690
Only his name struck me as odd.

364
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,790
His name?

365
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,590
You don't mean because it was Black?

366
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,290
No. James.

367
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,890
Really? There's James Bond, James Dean...

368
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:42,190
I get a pretty good image from that name.

369
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:48,190
Professor James Moriarty.

370
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,090
The Napoleon of the criminal world.

371
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:54,090
Holmes' arch rival, Professor Moriarty.

372
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,390
James is his first name.

373
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:00,890
I guess only a Sherlockian would think of that though.

374
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,690
After all, James is a common name.

375
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,290
Yes, I suppose so.

376
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,490
Something else bothers me more though.

377
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:13,190
The man who was looking at us from that car.

378
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,290
He was one of the passengers on the bus that got hijacked.

379
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:19,090
I'm positive he said his name was Shuichi Akai

380
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,490
when he was questioned by the police.

381
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,890
That was something.

382
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,790
Leaving a code like that when you were taken by surprise.

383
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:00,790
When'd you realize they weren't real cops?

384
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,990
When they spoke to me in Japanese,

385
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,790
it was as if they knew I understood.

386
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,290
If they were detectives

387
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:13,490
and if they knew I was a foreigner who could speak Japanese,

388
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:16,290
then they'd have confirmed my name in the very beginning.

389
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,890
That's what tipped me off.

390
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,990
I thought they knew who I really was

391
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:25,190
but were pretending not to, that's what made me suspicious.

392
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:28,590
Well, it seems it was a case of mistaken identity though.

393
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,690
But what a surprise.

394
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:34,490
I never thought you'd cut off your long hair.

395
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,490
I want to change my luck.

396
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,990
My girlfriend keeps leaving me.

397
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,490
Is that so?

398
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:44,990
You went out of your way to get me here.

399
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:49,490
So does that mean you have a chance of getting back with her?

400
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:53,490
Sort of. I want to get back at her.

401
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,190
For dumping me.

402
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,990
I want her to cry tears of blood.

403
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,480
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,240
"Fish scale"

405
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,040
The next case takes place in a mysterious restaurant.

406
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,340
It sure is different!
