Yeah.

3
00:00:05,525 --> 00:00:07,225
Yes.

4
00:00:07,225 --> 00:00:09,425
Of course I do.

5
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:11,725
Yeah. Yes.

6
00:00:11,725 --> 00:00:13,625
Yes, I see.

7
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:15,425
Understood!

8
00:00:15,425 --> 00:00:19,525
I will gladly accept the offer to perform!

9
00:00:19,525 --> 00:00:22,025
Yeah, that's right.

10
00:00:22,025 --> 00:00:25,125
Ran, what show is that?

11
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,225
Well, they're asking dad

12
00:00:26,225 --> 00:00:28,325
to appear on "The Most Useful School in the World" show

13
00:00:28,325 --> 00:00:30,125
as an instructor.

14
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,825
That's amazing.

15
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:33,025
For real?

16
00:00:33,025 --> 00:00:35,425
Isn't "The Most Useful School in the World"

17
00:00:35,425 --> 00:00:38,225
one of the most iconic shows on Nichiuri TV?

18
00:00:38,225 --> 00:00:42,525
May I inquire how much my appearance fee would be?

19
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:49,425
Well, that sort of amount is a little bit...

20
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:51,225
Is he planning to refuse?

21
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:52,325
What?

22
00:00:52,325 --> 00:00:55,025
Yoko Okino will appear as one of the guest panelists?

23
00:00:55,025 --> 00:00:56,625
I'm in! I'll do it!

24
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,625
Please allow me to participate!

25
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:02,825
Appearance fee? I don't need that sort of thing!

26
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:06,825
Dad.

27
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:10,125
Looks like they're one step ahead.

28
00:01:11,525 --> 00:01:13,425
Like the fog clears.

29
00:01:13,425 --> 00:01:15,625
Let's see through love and crime as well.

30
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:19,325
Uncle Kogoro will appear as a lecturer on that popular show?

31

He sees through the one and only truth.

00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:21,825
Is this too gaudy after all?

37
00:03:21,825 --> 00:03:26,525
Perhaps Yoko would like the necktie I usually wear better.

38
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:28,925
Nothing will change no matter which one you wear.

39
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:31,625
Hey, what are you doing?

40
00:03:32,725 --> 00:03:35,425
Stop dilly-dallying. Hurry up and come!

Yes! My apologies, master.

Isn't that the leading figure in the enka realm, Noburo Kimijima?

43

"Noburo Kimijima (67), Leading Figure in Enka" -You're right.

44
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,325
But he looks kind of frightening and strict.

45
00:03:48,325 --> 00:03:50,625
Noburo Kimijima is not only strict to others,

46
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,625
but is also famous for his self-discipline.

47
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:58,025
That's why he's still dominating the top seat in the realm of enka.

48
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:03,425
You're pretty supportive of him. Aren't you, Pops?

54
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,025
Yeah, it's all healed up.

Is that so?

93
00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:10,925
There's no way she'll be placed in the same room as you, is there?

94
00:06:10,925 --> 00:06:13,225
Well, then. I shall call you guys again

Please enjoy your boxed lunches until then.

97
00:06:21,225 --> 00:06:25,525
I see. So Yoko's waiting room is on the floor below.

98
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:32,725
I shall go and greet her now.

99

Yoko's waiting room is...

101
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:44,425
Hold it, dad.

102
00:06:44,425 --> 00:06:47,725
Why are you taking your lunch with you if you're going to greet her?

103
00:06:47,725 --> 00:06:49,125
What do you think?

104
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:52,225
Of course I plan to have lunch with Yoko!

105
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:56,125
It wouldn't taste as good if I had to eat with those fellows.

106

I knew you were up to something like that.

Then again, we seem to have followed suit

108
00:07:00,525 --> 00:07:02,925

Is that so?

124
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:45,625
Well, Ms. Yoko Okino hasn't arrived yet.

125

Anyway, shouldn't you go and greet Principal Sakai before that?

129
00:08:01,825 --> 00:08:03,425
You're right.

130
00:08:03,425 --> 00:08:06,525
In that case, I'll get to it now.

Speaking of this vase,

The Qing Dynasty?
it was made in China back in the Qing Dynasty.

The Qing Dynasty?

140

That's right.

141
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:32,525
This vase was made in the time when Qianlong,

142
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:37,425
the sixth emperor of the Qing Dynasty and an art enthusiast, reigned.

Hello. I'm Kogoro Mouri.

My apologies, but can that wait?

147
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:52,925
We're having an important discussion right now.

148
00:08:52,925 --> 00:08:57,625
So Noburo Kimijima is also a guest panelist for today's filming?

149
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,525
Pardon our intrusion.

150
00:08:59,525 --> 00:09:02,925
But actually, we saw you earlier as well, Mr. Kimijima.

151
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:05,525
And we were just talking about you.

152
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:08,025
I bet they weren't pleasant things, right?

153
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:09,625
On the contrary!

154
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:13,625
Actually, the first record I bought when I was in elementary school

155
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,825
was that famous song of yours, Mr. Kimijima.

156
00:09:15,825 --> 00:09:18,825
"A man must have guts, so bring it on!"

157
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:21,925
Oh, that song?

158
00:09:21,925 --> 00:09:25,125
I see you have quite a pair of trained eyes.

159
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:30,025
I see. So Pops is a fan of Noburo Kimijima.

160
00:09:30,025 --> 00:09:31,525
Mr. Kimijima.

161
00:09:31,525 --> 00:09:35,025
It's almost time for my meeting now.

162
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:37,025
Is that so?

163
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,925
Hey, do you like vases?

164
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,225
"Waiting Room 1, Masaako Sakai"

165
00:09:46,225 --> 00:09:48,525
Very well, everyone. I shall see you later.

166
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:50,025
All right.

167
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:53,325
That guy's going to talk all day and night, so be warned.

168
00:09:53,325 --> 00:09:56,325
-Okay. -See you all later.

169
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,925
Now, please come with me.

170
00:10:04,925 --> 00:10:08,525
"Waiting Room 5, Noburo Kimijima" -You know, that song is a wonder!

171
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:12,225
I can feel the true spirit of a man!

172
00:10:12,225 --> 00:10:14,225
Isn't that right?

173
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:19,025
Despite the warning, these two sure click well with each other.

174
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:21,525
Please let me help.

175
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:23,125
Shinobu!

176
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,225
Do not trouble the guests.

177
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,825
Hurry up and make the tea!

178
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:30,525
"Shinobu Oki (25), Kimijima's Disciple" -I am terribly sorry, master.

179
00:10:31,725 --> 00:10:33,325
Sorry about that.

180
00:10:35,425 --> 00:10:38,325
By the way, regarding that vase,

181
00:10:38,325 --> 00:10:42,725
how much do you think it is worth?

182
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:47,425
I'll have Mr. Honma do an appraisal on that in today's lecture.

183
00:10:47,425 --> 00:10:51,525
Who was Mr. Honma again?

184
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:55,025
The appraiser who seems unapproachable.

185
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:58,925
It's true that Mr. Honma is a difficult person.

186
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:01,425
However, on the subject of appraising relic antiques,

187
00:11:01,425 --> 00:11:03,725
his keen eyes are tried and true.

188
00:11:03,725 --> 00:11:07,625
Wasn't there a hack appraiser with the name Hanamura or something

189
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:11,825
who was behind that case involving Thief Kid?

190
00:11:11,825 --> 00:11:15,125
Their difference is like heaven and hell.

191
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,725
In fact, the ceramics and porcelain in this era

192
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:21,225
are especially popular among connoisseurs.

193
00:11:21,225 --> 00:11:24,025
I think the estimated value for this ranges from 100 million

194
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:26,925
to 160 million yen.

195
00:11:26,925 --> 00:11:29,125
100 million?

196
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,725
That high?

197
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:36,225
A vase like that... I mean, that vase is worth 100 million yen?

198
00:11:36,225 --> 00:11:39,725
Come to think of it, at a recent auction in the United Kingdom,

199
00:11:39,725 --> 00:11:42,325
another vase from the Qing Dynasty like this one was auctioned off

200
00:11:42,325 --> 00:11:47,025
for an equivalent of 5.7 billion yen, according to the news.

201
00:11:47,025 --> 00:11:51,225
It's a super treasure that even Thief Kid would go pale thinking about.

202
00:11:51,225 --> 00:11:55,825
But then again, he should have no interest in something like a vase.

203
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,778
So this is where they film "The Most Useful School in the World".

204
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:15,678
"THE MOST USEFUL SCHOOL IN THE WORLD"

205
00:12:16,978 --> 00:12:18,278
It's just like on TV.

206
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:20,278
Of course.

207
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:23,778
However, this place is surprisingly small.

208
00:12:23,778 --> 00:12:27,378
They say things appear to be more spacious on TV.

209
00:12:27,378 --> 00:12:29,178
That's right, dad.

210
00:12:29,178 --> 00:12:31,378
They've given us the script for today.

211
00:12:31,378 --> 00:12:34,178
What? I don't need something like that.

212
00:12:34,178 --> 00:12:36,578
You don't need it?

213
00:12:36,578 --> 00:12:40,078
So that's a puffed grain candy machine?

214
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:44,178
Let's see. The second period lecture is

215
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:46,778
"Experience the Fine Traditional Puffed Grain Candy Machine".

216
00:12:46,778 --> 00:12:51,778
Rice, wheat, and corn kernels will turn into snacks instantly.

217
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:53,878
So it says.

218
00:12:55,778 --> 00:12:58,878
How exactly do you make snacks using this machine?

219
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,078
You have to stay tuned for that.

220
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:02,778
I bet you'll be surprised.

221
00:13:02,778 --> 00:13:05,378
So this is a puffed grain candy machine.

222
00:13:05,378 --> 00:13:06,978
If I recall correctly,

223
00:13:06,978 --> 00:13:08,978
its formal nomenclature is "grain expander".

224
00:13:08,978 --> 00:13:13,078
When grains like raw rice is poured into the rotating pressure chamber,

225
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:16,778
the machine will rapidly decompress them and turn them into snacks.

226
00:13:16,778 --> 00:13:19,378
This is the first time I've seen the actual machine.

227
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:22,978
Well, isn't this Mr. Honma?

228
00:13:22,978 --> 00:13:25,778
Please do your best today.

229
00:13:25,778 --> 00:13:27,978
The class in the third period is

230
00:13:27,978 --> 00:13:29,978
"Ascertain Real or Fake,

231
00:13:29,978 --> 00:13:33,578
History of Counterfeiting and Modern Technology of Replica".

232
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:37,078
We've gone the extra mile and prepared real and fake antiques.

233
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:40,878
Mr. Honma will give a lecture on their differences.

234
00:13:40,878 --> 00:13:42,678
The items lined up over there

235
00:13:42,678 --> 00:13:47,178
are all counterfeits prepared by Mr. Honma.

236
00:13:47,178 --> 00:13:50,778
And the artifact is the one Mr. Kimijima brought.

237
00:13:52,978 --> 00:13:55,178
It's this one.

238
00:13:55,178 --> 00:13:58,978
What do you think? It's quite a work of art, right?

239
00:13:58,978 --> 00:14:02,278
This is... Excuse me for a second.

240
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,278
Remarkable...

241
00:14:08,678 --> 00:14:10,878
Where did you get this?

242
00:14:10,878 --> 00:14:12,978
Well, well, Mr. Honma.

243
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:15,978
I can see that it caught your eye.

244
00:14:15,978 --> 00:14:17,478
Apologies, Mr. Honma.

245
00:14:17,478 --> 00:14:20,478
Please appraise it when we're rolling.

246
00:14:25,578 --> 00:14:30,478
Well, then. We'd like to use these three as examples of counterfeits.

247
00:14:30,478 --> 00:14:32,378
Understood.

248
00:14:33,578 --> 00:14:35,678
So that's how it was.

249
00:14:35,678 --> 00:14:37,978
That's why Mr. Kimijima bothered to go as far as

250
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:40,778
to bring his beloved vase to the TV station.

251
00:14:42,678 --> 00:14:44,978
Principal Sakai, Vice Principal Ueda,

252
00:14:44,978 --> 00:14:47,878
and Class President Arita have arrived!

253
00:14:47,878 --> 00:14:51,178
How do you do? My name is Sakai.

254
00:14:51,178 --> 00:14:54,378
I look forward to working with you for today.

255
00:14:54,378 --> 00:14:56,578
"Shinya Ueda" -I'm Vice Principal Ueda.

256
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:58,378
Nice working with you.

257
00:14:58,378 --> 00:15:00,278
"Teppei Arita" -I'm Class President Arita.

258
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:02,378
It's a pleasure to meet you!

259
00:15:02,378 --> 00:15:05,178
No, it's our pleasure to meet you.

260
00:15:05,178 --> 00:15:07,478
Nice to meet you guys.

261
00:15:08,578 --> 00:15:11,078
"Daisuke Tsuchiya (45), Director" -Now, if everyone is ready to begin,

262
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:13,278
I would like to start the rehearsal right now.

263
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:15,378
Let's start with the first period,

264
00:15:15,378 --> 00:15:17,978
the lecture from Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

265
00:15:17,978 --> 00:15:20,278
Good morning!

266
00:15:23,878 --> 00:15:26,378
Yo... Yoko!

267
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:28,478
It really is Yoko Okino!

268
00:15:28,478 --> 00:15:31,378
What? Ms. Yoko, you didn't have to come until the rehearsal

269
00:15:31,378 --> 00:15:33,078
-for the second period. -Yes.

270
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:35,178
But when I read the script in the waiting room,

271
00:15:35,178 --> 00:15:38,078
I learned that Mr. Mouri is the instructor for the first period.

272
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:40,778
Wait. Does that mean

273
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:43,578
you took the trouble just to see me?

274
00:15:43,578 --> 00:15:46,478
No. I'm just here to say hello.

275
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,478
Let's get to the rehearsal!

276
00:15:48,478 --> 00:15:51,578
For starters, what should I begin with?

277
00:15:51,578 --> 00:15:55,478
Well, to kick things off...

278
00:15:55,478 --> 00:15:58,778
Shall we start with your performance corner on the art of self-defense?

279
00:15:58,778 --> 00:16:00,378
Understood!

280
00:16:00,378 --> 00:16:02,578
Dad's really giving it his all.

281
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:05,378
I hope he doesn't give out too soon during rehearsal.

282
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:07,278
Conan, you guys also came?

283
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:09,378
-Yeah. -We're here as audience.

284
00:16:09,378 --> 00:16:12,478
I'm all sweaty since I rushed here in a hurry.

285
00:16:14,478 --> 00:16:17,578
Excuse us!

286
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:20,778
Don't you think it's rude to take pictures without permission?

287
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:22,878
No, I'm just...

288
00:16:22,878 --> 00:16:26,078
Hey, bastard! You took sneak shots of Ms. Yoko?

289
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:28,178
-Dad. -I'm sorry.

290
00:16:28,178 --> 00:16:30,578
I'm a fan of Yoko, so I couldn't help...

291
00:16:30,578 --> 00:16:34,278
If you're a fan of her, you should respect her even more!

292
00:16:39,678 --> 00:16:40,878
He broke it.

293
00:16:40,878 --> 00:16:42,278
As a grown man,

294
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:45,078
it's insolent of you to take peeping photos of an idol.

295
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:46,378
You should be ashamed.

296
00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:50,178
But still, you didn't have to break it!

297
00:16:50,178 --> 00:16:53,878
Screw it! I'm going home!

298
00:16:53,878 --> 00:16:56,578
Wait! Please hold on.

299
00:16:56,578 --> 00:16:58,178
Now, now.

300
00:16:58,178 --> 00:17:00,678
Mr. Yamazaki, calm down.

301
00:17:00,678 --> 00:17:03,878
Ms. Yoko, we'll handle this, so please wait outside.

302
00:17:03,878 --> 00:17:05,178
All right.

303
00:17:06,978 --> 00:17:10,478
Mr. Mouri, please continue with your rehearsal.

304
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:13,678
Got it.

305
00:17:17,878 --> 00:17:21,278
Mr. Kimijima, please do us a favor, too.

306
00:17:31,878 --> 00:17:34,578
I'll buy you a replacement phone.

307
00:17:34,578 --> 00:17:35,878
Learn from this lesson

308
00:17:35,878 --> 00:17:39,878
and stop taking pictures of other people without permission.

309
00:17:41,778 --> 00:17:43,278
I'm truly sorry for this.

310
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:46,378
Idiot! There's no need to apologize!

311
00:17:49,878 --> 00:17:52,278
Darn it.

312
00:17:52,278 --> 00:17:55,978
Here are Mr. Kimijima's vase and three counterfeit items.

313
00:17:55,978 --> 00:17:58,778
And we still need...

314
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:02,189
Hey, they say there's an awesome relic vase on display.

315
00:18:02,189 --> 00:18:03,789
Let me have a look.

316
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:05,289
You can't!

317
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:09,289
This... This is epic! Let me touch it.

318
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:10,489
-Hey, you can't just go ahead... -It'll be fine.

319
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,889
-and take it! -It'll be fine!

320
00:18:11,889 --> 00:18:14,089
I'll be in trouble if you touch it with bare hands!

321
00:18:14,089 --> 00:18:15,378
Just for a while, just a while!

322
00:18:15,378 --> 00:18:15,389
We shall proceed to the rehearsal for the second period.
Just for a while, just a while!

323
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:19,278
We shall proceed to the rehearsal for the second period.

324
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:21,778
Now, Mr. Yamazaki, would you please begin?

325
00:18:21,778 --> 00:18:22,978
Yes.

326
00:18:39,078 --> 00:18:42,878
Geez, Mr. Kimijima is hard to deal with.

327
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:46,078
Although we managed to restore Mr. Yamazaki's mood...

328
00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:49,378
It was a close shave since we almost couldn't film.

329
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:54,778
Well, I guess the guy who took photos in secret was in the wrong, too.

330
00:18:54,778 --> 00:18:56,778
Then, I'll go ahead.

331
00:18:58,778 --> 00:19:00,978
Mr. Honma, where are you going?

332
00:19:00,978 --> 00:19:03,278
I'm not interested in that.

333
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:06,678
He's saying things like that.

334
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,178
But the truth is he's scared, isn't it?

335
00:19:09,178 --> 00:19:10,978
He's scared?

336
00:19:10,978 --> 00:19:13,778
Well, Ms. Okino, please take the hammer.

337
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,178
Okay!

338
00:19:15,178 --> 00:19:18,278
Please strike on this with full force.

339
00:19:21,878 --> 00:19:23,578
What is this?

340
00:19:23,578 --> 00:19:25,578
Well, just keep watching.

341
00:19:25,578 --> 00:19:28,878
Ran, I think it'd be best if you covered your ears.

342
00:19:28,878 --> 00:19:31,278
I'm asking what this is about!

343
00:19:33,378 --> 00:19:35,978
All right, here we go!

344
00:19:43,478 --> 00:19:45,578
That was scary.

345
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:49,478
Well, that's how it goes.

346
00:19:49,478 --> 00:19:52,478
Wait. You knew about it, Conan?

347
00:19:52,478 --> 00:19:56,178
Yeah. I've watched it on TV before.

348
00:19:56,178 --> 00:19:58,978
That was some shocking noise.

349
00:19:58,978 --> 00:20:01,478
It definitely surprised me.

350
00:20:01,478 --> 00:20:03,178
Me, too.

351
00:20:03,178 --> 00:20:05,578
Well, I want to apologize

352
00:20:05,578 --> 00:20:07,578
for saying unnecessary things in the waiting room.

353
00:20:07,578 --> 00:20:11,178
Because of me, you were scolded by Mr. Kimijima.

354
00:20:11,178 --> 00:20:13,778
It's all right. Please don't mind it.

355
00:20:13,778 --> 00:20:17,078
Don't make me repeat myself!

356
00:20:17,078 --> 00:20:18,578
Yeah!

357
00:20:18,578 --> 00:20:21,778
I said there's nothing to worry about, didn't I?

358
00:20:22,778 --> 00:20:25,678
Although Master Kimijima is a strict teacher,

359
00:20:25,678 --> 00:20:29,878
I still have complete respect for him.

360
00:20:32,978 --> 00:20:35,978
Something is troubling her, don't you think?

361
00:20:35,978 --> 00:20:39,178
You see, since my name, Okino is similar to her name, Oki,

362
00:20:39,178 --> 00:20:42,178
I somehow feel a sort of close bond between us.

363
00:20:42,178 --> 00:20:45,878
Sometimes, we even talk to each other when we're on the same set.

364
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:49,978
Is Ms. Shinobu Oki a disciple of Mr. Kimijima?

365
00:20:49,978 --> 00:20:51,378
Yeah, that's right.

366
00:20:51,378 --> 00:20:54,378
She said that the name Shinobu Oki was given to her by him.

367
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:58,478
I see. No wonder her name sounded like an enka singer.

368
00:20:58,478 --> 00:21:01,378
However, although she's working harder

369
00:21:01,378 --> 00:21:03,378
than everyone else to make her debut,

370
00:21:03,378 --> 00:21:05,578
her effort is not paying off.

371
00:21:05,578 --> 00:21:08,178
She also mumbled last time about how she should give up

372
00:21:08,178 --> 00:21:10,878
and go back to her hometown if she really has no talent.

373
00:21:10,878 --> 00:21:12,778
Is that so?

374
00:21:13,778 --> 00:21:16,478
Mr. Kamisuwa! Something's gone wrong.

375
00:21:16,478 --> 00:21:18,278
What is it this time?

376
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:23,478
What? Mr. Kimijima's vase has gone missing?

377
00:21:23,478 --> 00:21:24,878
What?

378
00:21:24,878 --> 00:21:27,478
The vase from the Qing Dynasty has gone missing?

379
00:21:28,978 --> 00:21:33,678
We're in deep trouble. It seems nobody saw anything.

380
00:21:33,678 --> 00:21:35,378
What's wrong?

381
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,478
Did something happen?

382
00:21:38,478 --> 00:21:40,778
During the rehearsal of the first period,

383
00:21:40,778 --> 00:21:43,378
it was definitely still here.

384
00:21:43,378 --> 00:21:45,978
Isn't that right, Mr. Arita?

385
00:21:45,978 --> 00:21:47,378
Yeah...

386
00:21:47,378 --> 00:21:49,078
Why would you know something like that?

387
00:21:49,078 --> 00:21:51,178
Oh, no. I'm just...

388
00:21:51,178 --> 00:21:54,078
How did this happen?

389
00:21:54,078 --> 00:21:56,978
Somebody must have stolen my vase.

390
00:21:56,978 --> 00:21:59,478
No, we can't determine that just yet...

391
00:21:59,478 --> 00:22:02,878
Who did it? Who stole my vase?

392
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:05,989
Principal Sakai! Don't tell me that you did it?

393
00:22:05,989 --> 00:22:07,789
Why... Why would I?

394
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:10,489
When I showed my vase to you,

395
00:22:10,489 --> 00:22:12,889
didn't you express a great deal of interest?

396
00:22:12,889 --> 00:22:15,978
Master, please calm yourself down!

397
00:22:15,978 --> 00:22:15,989
Even if we assume someone did steal it,
Master, please calm yourself down!

398
00:22:15,989 --> 00:22:18,278
Even if we assume someone did steal it,

399
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:19,578
there shouldn't be anyone

400
00:22:19,578 --> 00:22:21,778
who could carry a container with a vase hidden in it

401
00:22:21,778 --> 00:22:24,978
and leave the studio during rehearsal.

402
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:30,078
That means the culprit is still in this studio.

403
00:22:30,078 --> 00:22:32,578
And the missing Qing Dynasty vase

404
00:22:32,578 --> 00:22:34,978
should also still be somewhere in this studio.

405
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,740
Next Conan's Hint:

406
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,200
"Loud Sound"
