1
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,330
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,230
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,230
Today is part 2 of a true suspense story.

4
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,930
Get ready for a surprise when you find out who the killer is.

5
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,630
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,630
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,930
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,990
While we were driving along the coast,

9
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,390
our car broke down and we end up spending the night

10
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,890
at the villa of a lawyer called Tachibana.

11
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,490
However, the following day,

12
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,890
right in front of our very eyes,

13
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,090
the boat that Mr. Tachibana was on capsizes

14
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,490
and he drowns to death.

15
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,190
It looks to be that Mr. Tachibana was killed by a man

16
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,590
with the initials T.K that was blackmailing him.

17
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,590
It was thought that the man was Tatsuya Kumada,

18
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,290
a man that Mr. Tachibana had won an innocent verdict for five years ago.

19
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,190
Therefore, we rushed over to his place,

20
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,190
but what we ended up seeing was...

21
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,390
Mr. Kumada, we're coming in.

22
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,490
What... What is this?

23
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,790
The suspect Kumada...

24
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,290
has committed suicide.

25
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:05,290
"Bay of Revenge (Part 2)"

26
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,990
-Please back away. Please. -Please back away.

27
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,290
It looks to be he used this chair to commit suicide.

28
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,290
But, this rope is sure tied in a strange way.

29
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,990
The rope is tied to the railing of the veranda.

30
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,890
Could it be because if it were tied the ordinary way to the pillar,

31
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,890
his feet would touch the ground?

32
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,690
Well, there was a loud noise upstairs.

33
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:40,390
Like something toppling over, just once through.

34
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,490
About what time was it?

35
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,890
Maybe a little after 7:00 pm in the evening.

36
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,390
It fits the estimated time of death

37
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,990
which is thought to be around 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm.

38
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,490
About 7:00 pm?

39
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:58,290
Then I'll be of no help because I got back at about 7:15 pm.

40
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,690
I see.

41
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,190
But, that's strange.

42
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:06,590
When I got home, I heard Mr. Kumada's washing machine running.

43
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,590
Are you sure about that?

44
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,990
Positive.

45
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,590
It sure is strange for one who is contemplating suicide

46
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,090
to want to wash clothes.

47
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,490
Just as I thought, this is...

48
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,390
Hey! What do you think you're doing? Look out!

49
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,390
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,190
Which boat was Mr. Tachibana riding in?

51
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,290
The one to the very right, at the end.

52
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,290
I want to go take a look at it.

53
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,390
Hey...

54
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,390
Are you investigating on the case or something?

55
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,890
Yes, I'm a detective.

56
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,890
You're working hard.

57
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,490
What is this scratch?

58
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,090
Did you find something?

59
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,990
Was this scratch always here?

60
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,990
Oh, my. I've seen it first the first time! It's still new.

61
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,990
I wonder if Mr. Tachibana or the police who found the boat did it.

62
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,890
What a bummer.

63
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,590
The boat that was stolen was found,

64
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,890
but the anchor is stolen, why is all this happening to me?

65
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,490
The anchor?

66
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,990
Yes, the one that is used to keep the boat

67
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,190
from drifting away while fishing.

68
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,490
This type of anchor is thrown into the sea.

69
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:26,190
The one for the big boat over there was stolen, wire and all.

70
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,490
See, it was the same type as this one here.

71
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,190
It hasn't been found yet?

72
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,190
Nope! I was told it wasn't in the boat that was found this morning,

73
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,290
nor anywhere in the vicinity either.

74
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:41,890
On top of that, the anchor for the boat that was found was also gone.

75
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,290
I get the picture.

76
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,690
I'm back!

77
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,090
Welcome back.

78
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,590
Conan! Where were you?

79
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,490
What are you doing with Mr. Sakuraba, Ran?

80
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,290
I was cleaning!

81
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:06,890
And Mr. Sakuraba just came back after taking Johan for a walk!

82
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,890
Mr. Sakuraba, the case about Mr. Kumada five years ago,

83
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,090
what kind of a case was it?

84
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,190
I can't tell you because it's confidential.

85
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,490
What a childish thing to say.

86
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,590
Ms. Sugimura. Where were you all this time?

87
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:29,090
On a trip! I saw the news and I came right back!

88
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,390
I see.

89
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,290
And, is the killer the one called T.K?

90
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,290
Yes.

91
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,290
You know about Mr. Tatsuya Kumada?

92
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,190
Oh, my. You already know his name?

93
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,390
He used to be an elite working for a securities company.

94
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,990
But, one of his subordinates, Masahiko Tsuruta

95
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,890
embezzled his client's money.

96
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,490
After this, Tsuruta committed suicide.

97
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,990
However, after Tsuruta's diary was found,

98
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,590
it turned out that Kumada was the one who had actually embezzled the money.

99
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,990
Kumada was then arrested

100
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,590
for suspicion of framing a murder.

101
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:04,290
However, the person living below Masahiko Tsuruta's room

102
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:08,790
heard something fall around 10:00 pm.

103
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,490
But, at that time, Kumada was at a Karaoke snack shop.

104
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,490
His alibi was verified,

105
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,090
and he was released with no charges pressed against him.

106
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:23,090
That's exactly how it looks this time.

107
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,890
Ms. Sugimura.

108
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,990
Why do you who has only come to the office three years ago,

109
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,390
know of the case that happened five years ago?

110
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,590
I was just checking on who the initials T.K

111
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,390
that was signed on the letters were.

112
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,790
I also checked a little on Mrs. Tachibana too.

113
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:40,190
I hear that your father committed suicide because of your husband,

114
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,990
right, Mrs. Tachibana?

115
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,190
How you must've had a grudge towards your husband?

116
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,190
So much, as wanting to kill him.

117
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,690
Talk for yourself!

118
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,690
What?

119
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:56,290
I hear you've embezzled quite a large sum of money.

120
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,590
I'll bet you killed my husband because he found about it.

121
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,290
Don't be ridiculous!

122
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,490
How's it going, Dr. Agasa?

123
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,590
I found out that the address he was at during the hearing

124
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,090
was in the same prefecture, Chiba.

125
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:21,890
The family of the late Masahiko Tsuruta include his mother, Tamiko

126
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,290
and his little brother, Katsuhiko.

127
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,290
His mother and little brother?

128
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:43,990
Granny, is there a house around here where a Mr. Masahiko Tsuruta lives?

129
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,290
What? Masahiko's house?

130
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,890
See, it's right over there.

131
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,490
There is nobody there, though.

132
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,190
Why not?

133
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:59,190
His mother, Tamiko and little brother, Katsuhiko moved away.

134
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,890
After all, they've been through so much after what happened.

135
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:07,190
He was such a smart child who went to a school in Germany.

136
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,590
The house won't sell because it's in a place like this.

137
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:14,590
It seems that they used to come back to take care of it off and on.

138
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:17,990
But, since about a year ago, nobody's come around at all.

139
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,490
Johann.

140
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,790
I get it!

141
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,890
So, that's what happened!

142
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,690
It seems that sleeping pills of the same substance

143
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,690
as those found in Mr. Tachibana's body,

144
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,690
was also found in Kumada's body.

145
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,990
It was also found in the whisky left in the bottle.

146
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,790
Therefore, it was concluded that

147
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,790
Kumada committed suicide by taking sleeping pills

148
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,090
after killing Mr. Tachibana.

149
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,990
Gosh! When is it?

150
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,190
Don't be kidding.

151
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,690
Come, this way...

152
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,690
What's in here?

153
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,290
This file, I wonder what it is?

154
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,490
"Account Book"

155
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,590
An account book.

156
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,390
So, the renown detective is going to give his famed deduction?

157
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:35,190
What on earth is there to deduce at this point?

158
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,990
Well... please have a seat everyone.

159
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,690
I will now disclose the truth of

160
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,390
what happened to Mr. Tachibana and Mr. Tatsuya Kumada.

161
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:49,090
The truth? Hasn't the case been closed?

162
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:53,090
Are you saying that the conclusion that we have reached is not correct?

163
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:57,290
Exactly, Mr. Tatsuya Kumada was also killed

164
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:01,090
by the same person who killed Mr. Tachibana.

165
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:04,790
And, the killer is here with us!

166
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,890
What on earth are you talking about?

167
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:12,590
I will explain it to you right now.

168
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,880
The same sleeping pill was detected

169
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,980
in both the bodies of Mr. Tachibana and Mr. Kumada.

170
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:29,280
In other words, after putting Mr. Tachibana to sleep and killing him,

171
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,380
the killer, he did likewise to Mr. Kumada.

172
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,980
Moreover, he set it up to look as if Mr. Kumada committed suicide.

173
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,380
Is there anyone who was able to do something like that?

174
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,980
There are three people who could've carried it out.

175
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,680
Ms. Yaeko Kamei,

176
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,480
Mr. Yuichi Sakuraba,

177
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,880
and Mr. Tachibana, himself.

178
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,780
But, Yaeko was with us when the boat capsized!

179
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,980
Which means...

180
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,980
Wait a minute!

181
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,580
I was at the office in Tokyo at that time too.

182
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,180
No... the problem is not where you were

183
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,080
when the boat capsized!

184
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,080
Preparations to kill Mr. Tachibana

185
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,780
was made so many hours in advance and completed.

186
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,480
All that had to be done was wait.

187
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,980
Just what do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

188
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,580
I see! You mean the man that we saw...

189
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,680
the man who was wearing the red baseball cap!

190
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,880
Yes, he is the killer.

191
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,880
But that was more than two hours before the boat capsized.

192
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,380
How on earth did he make the boat sink?

193
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:44,180
All you have to do is think why the killer committed the crime yesterday.

194
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,080
As you already know, yesterday was spring tide.

195
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,580
Yes, it was spring tide indeed,

196
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,180
and we did have some difficulty in the search.

197
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,880
Can't you figure it out?

198
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,580
Spring tide is caused by great difference in water level

199
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,580
between low tide and high tide.

200
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,380
That's why the killer committed the murder yesterday.

201
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,480
Could you give us more details?

202
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,780
The man wearing the red baseball cap who we saw

203
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:16,080
approached Mr. Tachibana's boat,

204
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,580
and pulls the life jacket off Mr. Tachibana.

205
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,980
Then, he throws the anchor that he had stolen together

206
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,080
with the boat into the sea!

207
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,880
The killer hooks the claw that is tied on to the end of the rope

208
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,180
onto Mr. Tachibana's boat.

209
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,580
If set up this way,

210
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,280
when the water level rises because of high tide,

211
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,280
the anchor is pulled and tilts,

212
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:43,680
and when the boat capsizes, the claw comes off and sinks into sea.

213
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,280
Mr. Tachibana is thrown into the sea

214
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,380
and drowns.

215
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,480
What a way to commit murder!

216
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,980
The rental boat owner did call to say that his anchor had been stolen.

217
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,980
That's why the anchor of the boat that was stolen was missing?

218
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:08,280
Right, that anchor has probably sunk under the sea.

219
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,880
They should be searching the area where the accident occurred today.

220
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,580
-Hey! -Yes, sir!

221
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,280
I'll ask the station about it!

222
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,980
But, why would someone do something cruel like that?

223
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,680
Everything was done to create an alibi.

224
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,680
The killer went through all this to create an alibi for himself

225
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,880
during the time the boat was capsizing.

226
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,680
Yes, thank you!

227
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,680
Mr. Mouri! They seem to have found the anchor

228
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,380
right below the area where the boat capsized!

229
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,080
The rental boat owner just verified the anchor a while ago.

230
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,380
Moreover, they found a claw on the end of the rope.

231
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,280
Let me continue.

232
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,280
The killer who returned to shore,

233
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,780
and left the cap with Kumada's name on in back on the boat,

234
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,580
so that suspicion would focus on him.

235
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,580
According to the investigations officers, that cap was Kumada's!

236
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,980
No hair or anything of any other person was found on it.

237
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,980
The killer must've used a similar type of cap for disguise.

238
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,580
The killer probably go a hold of Kumada's cap

239
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,980
when they saw each other or something.

240
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,680
The killer and Kumada must've known each other.

241
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,280
As evidence of that, the killer went to Kumada's residence

242
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:30,680
and was able to make him drink whisky with a sleeping drug in it.

243
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,780
Then after standing Kumada's body up against the sliding door,

244
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,680
the killer wound the rope around his neck.

245
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,180
The rope that was pulled through the railing of the veranda

246
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,380
and using this as a point of support,

247
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,880
the killer probably pulled on the rope with all his might.

248
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,980
The rope was then tied onto the railing of the veranda,

249
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,380
and the sliding door opened.

250
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,680
Finally, the killer set the chair in place.

251
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,680
That's it.

252
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,080
But, at around 7:00 pm when the person downstairs heard a sound,

253
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,980
everyone here has an alibi.

254
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,880
Well, the killer doesn't need an alibi for that specific time either.

255
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,280
Just what do you mean?

256
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,180
This is the same trick as the one Mr. Tatsuya Kumada

257
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,280
had used to kill Mr. Masahiko Tsuruta five years ago.

258
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,680
-What? -What was that?

259
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,380
The washing machine that was running after 7:00 pm.

260
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,080
The killer tied a string around the spinner

261
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,980
in the centre of the washing machine

262
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,980
so that it would be wound as the washing operate.

263
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,580
Then a hoop is made at one end of the string

264
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,380
and hooked onto the back of the chair.

265
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:38,280
All that is left to do is to set the timer of the washing at 7:00 pm.

266
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,980
When the washing machine starts, the string is wound,

267
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,980
and the chair falls down.

268
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,380
I'll have them check the washing machine right away!

269
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,380
Which means that Mr. Tachibana was killed around 1:00 pm.

270
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,580
Kumada's estimated time of death is between 6:00 pm and 7:30 pm,

271
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,380
so before 7:00 pm and around 6:00 pm,

272
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:07,180
the person who does not have an alibi at this time is the killer.

273
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,280
Let's take you, Mr. Sakuraba, for example,

274
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,680
you left here around 1:00 pm

275
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,080
and returned after 7:00 pm.

276
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,080
Please wait a minute!

277
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,880
There are many who had a grudge against Mr. Tachibana!

278
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,980
Did you check all those people already?

279
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,980
Sakuraba, what did you come to pick up at the office yesterday?

280
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,280
Moreover, why at about the same time

281
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,880
Mr. Tachibana's boat had just capsized?

282
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,480
I...

283
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,580
Mr. Sakuraba, did you come to get this account book?

284
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:43,980
So, that you could make it look as if Ms. Sugimura used the money!

285
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,380
You!

286
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,580
I... I'm sorry.

287
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,980
I was going to adjust the book with Mr. Tachibana last night to set you up

288
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,580
and make it look like you used the money that he lavishly used.

289
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,680
That's why I was relieved to hear that Mr. Tachibana passed away.

290
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,580
Mr. Sakuraba! Just what do you mean by you felt relieved!

291
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,180
I was sick and tired of assisting Mr. Tachibana's wrongdoings!

292
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,780
He threatened me saying that

293
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,080
I wouldn't be able to function as a lawyer in the future

294
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,280
if I didn't do as he said.

295
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,680
I was ready to break down any minute.

296
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,380
Mr. Sakuraba, we'll hear the rest of your story at the station.

297
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,480
No! I didn't kill him!

298
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,280
If you resist, we'll arrest you hear on the spot!

299
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,480
Please believe me!

300
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,280
I'm not the one who killed Kumada and Mr. Tachibana.

301
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,980
I'm innocent!

302
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,080
That's enough!

303
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,980
Mr. Sakuraba didn't kill anyone.

304
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,980
The one who killed them both is me!

305
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,880
No way!

306
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,080
Ms. Yaeko.

307
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,080
I was waiting for you to confess.

308
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,280
I knew you were not the type of person

309
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,680
who could frame somebody up and keep silent about it.

310
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:57,580
Yaeko could've put sleeping pills in Mr. Tachibana's thermos any time.

311
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,680
That day, after we all left,

312
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,380
you disguised yourself as Kumada and left from the back door.

313
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,680
You then, approached Mr. Tachibana's boat.

314
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:13,580
Soon later, you witnessed Mr. Tachibana's boat capsize together with us.

315
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,380
When you went shopping at sundown,

316
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,780
you parked the car in the parking lot of the supermarket,

317
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:25,380
disguised yourself again and headed for Kumada's place.

318
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,380
Isn't that right?

319
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,780
Please take a look at this.

320
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,280
Conan found this name plate

321
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,980
in the yard of Mr. Masahiko Tsuruta's house.

322
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,680
Johann?

323
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:44,280
Yes, if you read it in German, it's read "Johan".

324
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,180
This probably is the name

325
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:50,380
that your son used in Germany when he was an exchange student,

326
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,880
isn't that right, Mrs. Tamiko Tsuruta?

327
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,880
What?

328
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,980
You mean Yaeko is...

329
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,380
Yes, the mother of Masahiko Tsuruta

330
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,380
who was killed by Kumada.

331
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,280
I should've realized sooner.

332
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,980
Yesterday, Johan chased the boat you were riding at the cape.

333
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:23,280
I'm sure that Johan knew it was you despite your disguise.

334
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,580
My younger son passed away last year too,

335
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,580
so Johan is the only one left to me now.

336
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,680
I lied saying that he was a stray and came to live here with him.

337
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,280
I fought with all my might in court,

338
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,680
and yet no one recognised me.

339
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:43,680
I aged all of sudden from the inappropriate sentence of the hearing.

340
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,380
And...

341
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,580
Six months ago, Kumada finally appeared.

342
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,380
I happened to hear about the trick using the washing machine

343
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,680
from the other side of the door.

344
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,280
Kumada was promising Mr. Tachibana that

345
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,280
he'd pay any amount Mr. Tachibana wanted to handle the case.

346
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,180
Mr. Tachibana won Kumada an innocent verdict

347
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,680
despite knowing that he had killed Masahiko.

348
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,880
I followed Kumada back to his apartment that day,

349
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,080
and thought up the idea of killing him and Mr. Tachibana

350
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,680
when I saw the red baseball cap that he forgot here.

351
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,080
And you started sending letters of blackmail

352
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,580
that looked to have been mailed from Kumada to Mr. Tachibana.

353
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,580
Yes, I've been so scared since yesterday.

354
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,880
But, I'm really relieved now.

355
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:37,180
You were expecting to get arrested to begin with, weren't you?

356
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,280
That's why you went ahead and committed the crime

357
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,980
despite a detective like me being here.

358
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,180
I guess so.

359
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,680
I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused.

360
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,180
Dad! Now what?

361
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:35,880
Weird, and I just got it repaired.

362
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,980
When are we ever going to make it back to Tokyo?

363
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,280
Please help us!

364
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,980
We just need to get to Tokyo!

365
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,380
Maybe more cars will stop if took his place?

366
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,080
Never mind, let's stay here and watch the ocean a while longer.

367
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,580
Well, why not?

368
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,480
Hey!

369
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,680
Do something!

370
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,340
Next Conan's Hint:

371
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,160
"Accessory"

372
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,380
Finally that mystery is solved!

373
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,380
Megure's hat is taken off?
