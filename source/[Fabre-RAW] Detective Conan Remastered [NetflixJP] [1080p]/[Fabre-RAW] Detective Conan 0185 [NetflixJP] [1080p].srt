1
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,040
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,740
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,640
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,940
In television, movies, and books detectives are everywhere.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,540
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,590
Come on!

9
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,890
Gosh, I bite my tongue.

10
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,190
Drive safely, will you, dad?

11
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,490
They advertised the place as being a very secluded

12
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,890
and little known hot spot.

13
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,390
Of course it's going to be hard to get to!

14
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,890
Yes, I can see it now.

15
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,090
Hey, dad. This road is paved.

16
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,590
Weren't we supposed to take this road to get here?

17
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,190
Look! They've got an archery area!

18
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,790
You're just trying to change the subject.

19
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,890
I figured.

20
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,290
Look out!

21
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,490
I'm so sorry!

22
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,090
It went off course. Are you all right?

23
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,290
Hey, you!

24
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,390
Oh! I know you!

25
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,990
You're Kogoro Mouri, the famous detective. It is you, isn't it?

26
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,290
Well, yes, you're very perceptive.

27
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,090
Are you staying at the villa too?

28
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,090
You mean you are too?

29
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,390
Yes.

30
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,890
I guess this means the two famous detectives will finally meet.

31
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,890
Huh?

32
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:23,790
"Murder of the Famous Detective (Part 1)"

33
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,390
What is this? Isn't anybody on duty?

34
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,090
Excuse me!

35
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,190
What was that sound?

36
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,890
-Those were gunshots. -Huh?

37
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,890
The forest around us is hunting grounds.

38
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,990
-What? -You're Mr. Mouri, I presume.

39
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,690
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

40
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,190
I'm here alone today.

41
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,390
Dad! We drove right through that forest,

42
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,590
we could've been hurt.

43
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:02,090
Actually the hunting areas are marked with signs and fenced off

44
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,690
but there's always the danger of being hit by a stray bullet.

45
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:09,990
We've already been baptized, only it was by an arrow.

46
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,090
Welcome back.

47
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,990
Here's your key.

48
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,890
Who does he think he is anyway?

49
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,790
We're very proud of our garden restaurant here,

50
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,690
please have dinner there.

51
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,090
Garden restaurant?

52
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,790
Just have a look.

53
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,090
Wow, it s beautiful!

54
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,190
Ran, look at this.

55
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,490
There's a mountain stream down there.

56
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,790
-Conan, be careful. -Okay.

57
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,890
It's raining.

58
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,390
Gosh. If it keeps raining,

59
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,490
we won't be able to eat in this great garden restaurant.

60
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,490
You're...

61
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,490
That's right. Jack the Ripper the 5th!

62
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,990
Who's there?

63
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,990
You're...

64
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,290
That's right. Urban hunter Bannai Kujirao at your service!

65
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,690
How can you watch such junk?

66
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,590
How rude! It was getting to the best part!

67
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,590
He's no detective.

68
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,890
Real cases don't get solved so easily

69
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,890
week after week like that.

70
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,390
I'm very sorry you think they're so easy.

71
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,890
Urban hunter Bannai Kujirao at your service!

72
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,190
It's really you!

73
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:29,190
This is Kazuyoshi Sunaoka, the actor who plays Bannai Kujirao.

74
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,190
I'm his manager, Noe Tanigawa.

75
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,790
It's nice to see you again.

76
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,990
You're Kogoro Mouri, the genuine detective.

77
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,990
It's a pleasure to meet you.

78
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,390
You know, I'm actually a big fan of yours.

79
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,090
Can I have your autograph later?

80
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,990
Gosh, he's all talk.

81
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,490
Thank you!

82
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,090
And here's my calling card, just in case.

83
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,590
It's such an honor to be at the same table

84
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,590
with the famous detective Mouri.

85
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,690
The same goes for me.

86
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,390
I never dreamed I'd get to meet a famous actor.

87
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:11,390
Are you filming here?

88
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,790
Actually, I've been given secret orders

89
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,390
to come here and protect you.

90
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:23,790
We're here to discuss the show and just to relax.

91
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,190
Naturally, no one besides us knows

92
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,290
that the popular star Mr. Sunaoka is with us.

93
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:33,090
You're a great team.

94
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,390
Sunaoka and I went out this afternoon

95
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,790
to enjoy some hunting.

96
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,890
We took cover under the rain

97
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,590
and stayed out all day but got zilch.

98
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,790
I can't believe how anyone could shoot live animals.

99
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,290
That's why I opted for archery.

100
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,890
Oh! I did, however nearly spear some humans!

101
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,690
Yes, it was a close call.

102
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,390
We nearly ended up as trophies on the wall.

103
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,590
What do you mean by that?

104
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,890
By the way, what were you doing?

105
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,890
You don't look like you've gotten rid of your stress.

106
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,390
That's because I stayed in my room

107
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,990
thinking up a plot for the next show.

108
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,090
That man's kind of scary.

109
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,890
And did you come up with something good, sir?

110
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,890
Kazu!

111
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:20,590
Lately, it seems the viewers solve the crime before I do.

112
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,590
That just won't do.

113
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,590
Mr. Sunaoka, put yourself in my shoes.

114
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,190
I have to write scenarios to fit your personality.

115
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,190
Now now, we're here to work something out

116
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,090
to make the show more enjoyable.

117
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,690
Let's have some constructive suggestions.

118
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,790
That's easy for you to say.

119
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:40,090
All you're concerned about is the money.

120
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,890
I know all about it.

121
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,590
I hear you're pocketing some of the production fees.

122
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,590
How dare you! That's a lie!

123
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,790
All right, that's enough.

124
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,990
There's a lot of bad blood behind the scenes.

125
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,190
Kazu, I think you've had a little bit too much to drink.

126
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,690
-Let's get you back to your room. -Leave me alone!

127
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:02,090
I want to talk to Mr. Mouri a little longer.

128
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,390
You're always so bossy!

129
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,290
But that won't be for long.

130
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,590
A major production company

131
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,490
is offering me a bundle to sign up with them.

132
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,790
What are you talking about?

133
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,690
We've discussed that over and over again.

134
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,390
Now come on, go to your room and get some sleep.

135
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,990
I'm the biggest star your agency's got.

136
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,790
If you lose me, you probably won't be able to stay in the business.

137
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,190
Well, Mr. Detective, I'll catch you again later.

138
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,690
Mr. Tahara, if you've got any gripes against me,

139
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,190
just let me know. I'll quit anytime.

140
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,690
Kazu, if you quit,

141
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,190
the whole show will go down the drain!

142
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,690
Tanigawa, do something!

143
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,290
What you see on TV and reality is really two different things.

144
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,290
It certainly is.

145
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,990
I'm sorry about that scene.

146
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,690
You may not think so, but that guy's very conscientious.

147
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,890
He's very serious about making the show a success.

148
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,890
It's just that he can't hold his liquor,

149
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,590
please forgive him.

150
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,590
Yes. Well, good luck to you.

151
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,190
Thank you. Now, shall we continue drinking?

152
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,790
It's empty.

153
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,490
I'll go get you another one.

154
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,890
Thanks.

155
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,690
Here, your key.

156
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,590
I didn't mean what I said. Sorry.

157
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,190
Goodnight.

158
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,090
Boss.

159
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,590
Sorry to keep you waiting.

160
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,990
-Thanks! -It was worth the wait!

161
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,990
These are for you two.

162
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,690
-Thank you. -Thanks.

163
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,290
No problem. Here you go, Mr. Mouri.

164
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,790
Thanks.

165
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,590
Now that Mr. Sunaoka and Ms. Tanigawa's gone,

166
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,690
he's suddenly in such a good mood.

167
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,590
Tahara, why don't you join us?

168
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,190
Sure.

169
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,990
Excuse me for a second.

170
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,190
What's up?

171
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,990
I just thought of an interesting trick.

172
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,890
I better write it down before I forget.

173
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,990
It's not easy being a writer.

174
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,690
Let's toast, Mr. Mouri.

175
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,590
-Cheers! -Cheers!

176
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,890
Mr. Nagatsuka, you have a call from Tokyo,

177
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,690
you can take it at the front desk.

178
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,090
It's 8 o'clock, who could it be at this hour?

179
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,090
Excuse me for a minute.

180
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:30,590
Gosh, I'm all alone.

181
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,090
Keep me company, you've got your juice.

182
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,890
Dad, I think you've had enough.

183
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,190
Hello? This is Kogoro Mouri.

184
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,190
How about it? Why don't you come up to my room

185
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,590
and we'll talk detective?

186
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,690
-Mr. Sunaoka, it's you. -Huh?

187
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,190
Hold on for a second. What is that?

188
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,790
Hello? Mr. Sunaoka?

189
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,090
Gosh.

190
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,490
What's the matter, dad?

191
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,190
That was Mr. Sunaoka.

192
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,290
First, he asks me to come up to his room,

193
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,090
then he hangs up on me.

194
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,290
A gunshot?

195
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,490
It sounded like it came from across the valley.

196
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,090
What could anyone be shooting at this hour?

197
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,890
Everyone stay inside. It might be dangerous.

198
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:16,890
Ms. Tanigawa.

199
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,390
What is it?

200
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,590
Did you just hear that gunshot?

201
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,890
So it was a gunshot after all.

202
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,390
I'm sure Kazu's asleep by now.

203
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,990
The window in Kazu's room...

204
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,990
There's a hole in it! It looks like a bullet hole!

205
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,590
What did you say?

206
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,790
-Sir, the key! -Yeah, you're right!

207
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,890
Mr. Akashi! Get the master key

208
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,290
and meet us in front of Mr. Sunaoka's room!

209
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,590
-Okay. -What's going on?

210
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,990
Mr. Sunaoka! Wake up!

211
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,090
Is there no response?

212
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,490
He never gets up when he falls asleep while drunk.

213
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,190
Mr. Mouri, I've brought the key.

214
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,690
Mr. Sunaoka, we're coming in!

215
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,570
Someone tell me what happened!

216
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,770
Why would anyone kill Kazu?

217
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,270
Mr. Mouri, it's been a long time.

218
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,270
Hello, Detective Yokomizo.

219
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,870
Take a look at this.

220
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,570
As for you, ladies and gentlemen.

221
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,270
Please sit downstairs in the lobby.

222
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,170
I'll be down to question you later.

223
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,270
Sure, he says some harsh things when he's drunk

224
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,070
but it's nothing anyone would kill him over!

225
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,070
What am I going to do? I'm going to answer for this!

226
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,070
And they just decided to extend the show.

227
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,170
Okay, everyone. I know how you must all feel

228
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,270
but the crime lab technicians are coming in now.

229
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,970
By the looks of it, the only wound is

230
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,170
the bullet wound on his forehead.

231
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,670
That's right. That's what killed him.

232
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,670
But seeing as the flesh isn't burned

233
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,470
and also there are no powder burns,

234
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,670
I'd say he was shot from a distance.

235
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,070
The height of this hole and Mr. Sunaoka's position

236
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,270
were he was standing is almost the same height.

237
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,170
I'm pretty sure he was shot

238
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:31,270
while he was standing by the window.

239
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,470
Which means the shooter was...

240
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:40,370
When we heard the shot being fired,

241
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,170
it came from across the valley.

242
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,570
Let's go have a look.

243
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,170
What's that?

244
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,970
It looks like there's some kind of plant fiber

245
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,170
mixed in with the glass.

246
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,570
Conan!

247
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,670
Always getting in our way! What is it with you?

248
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,170
Come here!

249
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,670
You're getting fast.

250
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,370
The only way to get to the other side of the valley from the villa

251
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,470
is by crossing this suspended bridge.

252
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,970
Be careful and only five people can cross at a time.

253
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,470
It's quite far from the villa.

254
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,670
Yes, it is.

255
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,170
Now we walk along the cliff for about 10 minutes

256
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,970
and we'll be across from the villa.

257
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,070
-We're here. -Finally.

258
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,070
It takes 30 minutes one way.

259
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:42,970
But then, the shooter's escape route becomes another puzzle.

260
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,270
Who's there?

261
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,970
I'm sorry.

262
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,770
Ran?

263
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:53,170
What are you doing here?

264
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:56,970
Well, Conan went charging out of the villa.

265
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,070
I got worried so I followed him.

266
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:02,370
So why are you hiding in there?

267
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,770
Well, Conan...

268
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,270
Where'd he go?

269
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,670
Conan!

270
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,270
The rifle's over here!

271
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,170
Conan!

272
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,070
Dad.

273
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,570
Gosh.

274
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,370
Tie him up some place!

275
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,870
Conan, you were very naughty.

276
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,270
I'm sorry.

277
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,670
We've got cartridge casings here.

278
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,370
I think it's safe to say this is the murder weapon.

279
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,170
The killer must have stood here aiming for Mr. Sunaoka

280
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,070
on the other side of that window.

281
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,770
Take these casings

282
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,470
and that rifle to the lab right away.

283
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,670
Yes, sir!

284
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,270
What's this? The underside of this rifle is dry.

285
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,870
Take a shot of this.

286
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,970
Mr. Mouri. What time did it stop raining around here?

287
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,070
Let's see...

288
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,370
In the evening, it had stopped by the time it got dark.

289
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,970
Then I wonder why it wasn't wet under the rifle.

290
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,570
Never mind that, Detective Yokomizo.

291
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:10,170
After shooting Mr. Sunaoka,

292
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:13,170
the killer escaped through this road.

293
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,170
You'd better get a roadblock set up right away.

294
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,170
-Yeah, you're right. -But something's not right

295
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,470
Remember? When we climbed up here,

296
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,970
we didn't see anyone else's footprints, did we?

297
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,970
That's right. It was so slippery after the rain.

298
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,370
I was so scared of that mountain path,

299
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,170
I kept my head down following Conan's footprints,

300
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,670
so I know I didn't see anyone else's.

301
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,170
So maybe the killer took this road.

302
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:42,370
There aren't any footprints on this side.

303
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,570
What?

304
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,670
What is really going on?

305
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,470
Mr. Mouri!

306
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,070
Take a look at this.

307
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,370
There's a rope tied to this tree.

308
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,970
I'm pretty sure the killer used this rope

309
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,070
and escaped by that stream.

310
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,970
The current is strong

311
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,070
so the killer probably used a rubber raft

312
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,070
to get here from upstream.

313
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:10,670
The killer ties the raft on the shore then climbs up the rocks

314
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:14,270
then waited for Mr. Sunaoka to appear at the villa.

315
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,770
Then...

316
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,870
Mr. Sunaoka was shot.

317
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,870
Then the killer used this rope to get back down

318
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,770
then probably used the raft to get downstream.

319
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,970
Oh, no! Set up roadblocks in the areas downstream!

320
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,570
He's wrong.

321
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:42,970
There was danger of being seen by the people in the restaurant,

322
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,170
climb up and down from here

323
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,370
and the killer certainly wouldn't shoot from this place

324
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,570
which leaves him in the open.

325
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,670
Besides, when we heard the gunshot and came running,

326
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,170
there's no way the killer

327
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,970
could have gotten away without being seen.

328
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,570
Which means...

329
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,970
Hey, Conan!

330
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,970
I knew it.

331
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,570
The rope's wet.

332
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,670
Conan!

333
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,470
You're not supposed to run around.

334
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,770
-All right. -We're going back.

335
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:18,070
You're going to get lost if you keep wandering around.

336
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,370
Wait up!

337
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:29,370
Where were you when you heard the gunshot?

338
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,870
I had a call from the station.

339
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,770
I was on the telephone at the front desk

340
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,470
so I didn't hear it.

341
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,870
We've already confirmed it with the other party.

342
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,570
So you were using the telephone at the front desk, is that correct?

343
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,170
Yes, but not the public telephone,

344
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,070
I was using the front desk's phone.

345
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,270
It has a cord.

346
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,570
That's right. Outside calls all come in on that.

347
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,570
The battery in my portable phone was dead.

348
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,570
I see. And what about you, Mr. Tahara?

349
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,370
I was at the garden restaurant

350
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,070
putting ideas for the scenarios together.

351
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,670
I was concentrating so much,

352
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,870
I didn't hear the gunshot at first.

353
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,670
By the time I looked to where the shot came from

354
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,470
with Mr. Mouri and the others, there was nobody around.

355
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:14,570
That's right. When the shot went off,

356
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:19,470
it was just after Mr. Nagatsuka got his telephone call at 8 o'clock.

357
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,470
When Mr. Mouri and the others

358
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,970
came to the front desk to get the master key,

359
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,470
I was just getting off the phone.

360
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,470
I'm sure you can track the time of the call

361
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,470
if you check the phone records, right?

362
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:33,470
You make my job of questioning you so easy

363
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:36,170
being you're all in the mystery profession.

364
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,870
And what about you, Ms. Tanigawa?

365
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,670
After I took Mr. Sunaoka back to his room,

366
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:45,570
I went to take a shower.

367
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,470
Just as I was getting out of the shower,

368
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,070
when I heard the sound,

369
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,670
but it never dawned on me that we were in danger.

370
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,370
There was a commotion outside

371
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,170
so I went out to the veranda to have a look.

372
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,670
And I never dreamed Kazu had been shot!

373
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,970
I'm very sorry.

374
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,470
Mr. Akashi, where were you?

375
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,770
I was in the kitchen washing dishes.

376
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,370
The fan was on

377
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,570
and I'm so used to hearing the shots from the hunting grounds

378
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,270
so I didn't hear a thing.

379
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:18,070
That's right. It was physically impossible

380
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:22,470
for anyone in the villa to fire the rifle from that spot.

381
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,670
The only ones staying in the villa

382
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:28,270
besides us is that group.

383
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,770
Although it was kept secret that Mr. Sunaoka was here,

384
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:34,870
it wouldn't have been too hard to find that out.

385
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:41,270
But if the killer was someone from the outside,

386
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,170
it would have made better sense to shoot him on the hunting grounds

387
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,470
and make it look like he was shot accidentally by a stray bullet.

388
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:50,270
And to find a safe hiding place, there were other options.

389
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:53,070
So why deliberately use a boat and rope to escape

390
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:57,070
and risk being seen from the restaurant?

391
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,470
I'm absolutely sure that was a camouflage.

392
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,470
And there's only one reason for going through all that trouble.

393
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:09,070
The killer needed an alibi.

394
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,470
Which means the killer is someone from the villa.

395
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,870
Yes, that's right.

396
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:18,570
One of those three

397
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,470
is the killer.

398
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:25,370
There's an exit to every maze.

399
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,470
This seemingly impossible murder...

400
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:30,570
I vow to solve this case

401
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,570
on behalf of the murdered detective!

402
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,400
Next Conan's Hint:

403
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,200
"Bullet"

404
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,440
Next time surprising conclusion!

405
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,440
Leave it to the real detective!

406
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,400
You're not.
