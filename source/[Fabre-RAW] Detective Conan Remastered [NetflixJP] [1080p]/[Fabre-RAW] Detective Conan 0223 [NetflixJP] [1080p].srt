1
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,330
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,230
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,830
Today's episode is Part II of the story about the mermaid.

4
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,730
Danger creeps up on the interesting couple.

5
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,230
He sees through to the one and only truth.

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,030
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,630
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,190
The strange letter sent to Heiji Hattori beckons us

9
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,890
and we come to the island of Bikuni

10
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,290
"Bikuni Island"

11
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:15,690
But we learn that the sender, Saori Kadowaki is missing.

12
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,290
That night, the island is lively

13
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,090
because they are celebrating the annual Dugong Festival.

14
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,290
The islanders believe that whoever possesses the Dugong Arrow blessed by

15
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,390
the holy person who gained eternal life by eating dugong meat

16
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,190
would also be granted with eternal life.

17
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,990
But during the festival,

18
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,090
one of Saori's childhood friends, Toshimi Ebihara

19
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,690
is found hanging by the neck in the waterfall.

20
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,590
Hattori and I realize this is a murder

21
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,090
and we begin to investigate,

22
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,590
but on the night of Toshimi's wake, another murder takes place.

23
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,690
You're right.

24
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,890
What's going on?

25
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,190
Oh, Heiji.

26
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,690
Somebody's out there.

27
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,090
Are you sure?

28
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:15,890
"The Mermaid Disappears (The Unveiling)"

29
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,790
I don't think she's been dead longer than an hour.

30
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,890
She was probably strangled then put in this net.

31
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,490
The footprints on the sand are from sandals and rubber boots.

32
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,690
Nahoko was probably wearing these sandals,

33
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,990
so the murderer must've been wearing boots.

34
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,790
How cruel.

35
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,990
Hey, look.

36
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,590
See, doesn't this look like an arrow was stepped on by sandals?

37
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,490
It's been stepped on by sandals

38
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,790
so Nahoko must have stepped on it after it fell

39
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,790
while she struggled with the murderer.

40
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,890
The killer must've taken the arrow.

41
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:57,890
Let's follow the boot prints, that'll lead us to the killer.

42
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,290
You're right.

43
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,290
Hey, these prints...

44
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,690
They look like they go straight into the ocean.

45
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,590
You're right.

46
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,990
There's some shiny things around the prints.

47
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,490
What are they?

48
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,790
These are...

49
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,390
Fish scales?

50
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:25,190
There're fish scales on Nahoko's body too. There's 2 or 3 on her.

51
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,490
What?

52
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,790
What are you people doing there?

53
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,090
Carrying out an investigation, of course.

54
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,290
We're the Fukui Prefecture Police, that's our job.

55
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,790
-Prefecture Police? -You're finally here.

56
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,690
What? The killer's footprints disappeared into the sea?

57
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,190
Yeah, they left some fish scales behind too.

58
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,890
Did you say fish scales?

59
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,890
You're not saying the killer's a mermaid?

60
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:55,590
How stupid. Mermaids don't wear rubber boots.

61
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:59,190
The killer probably approached from the shoreline

62
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,590
and then went up to the nets where Nahoko was told to wait.

63
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,190
After murdering Nahoko, the killer walked back to the shoreline

64
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,390
and left the scene walking through the water.

65
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,690
Now I get it.

66
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:14,690
By the way, did anyone see Nahoko leave the room?

67
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:19,090
Not me. She wasn't there when I got there.

68
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,390
Benzo, what about you?

69
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,590
You signed in right after Nahoko, didn't you?

70
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,990
I didn't see her

71
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,690
and nobody was in the room when I got there.

72
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,590
That means Nahoko was the first one to get here

73
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,690
then she left to go to where the nets were hung.

74
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,090
Wait a minute, do you think the person who killed Toshimi

75
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,490
killed Nahoko too?

76
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,290
We don't know that for sure yet

77
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,590
but we do know the killer took Nahoko's arrow.

78
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,190
The Dugong Arrow?

79
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,090
Before she disappeared,

80
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,190
Saori also said that she'd lost her arrow.

81
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,690
Don't tell me that...

82
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,190
Yeah. She might already be dead too.

83
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,790
I saw Saori near the Mermaid's Waterfall

84
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,490
on the morning of yesterday's festival.

85
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,690
I saw her too. She was far away and I only got a glance,

86
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,790
she was in the forest by the waterfall.

87
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,090
Are you absolutely sure it was Saori?

88
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,290
No mistake, she's the only girl with brown hair and glasses.

89
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,890
And she always wears blue clothes.

90
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,090
Then she must be running away from something,

91
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,490
that's why she's hiding from everyone.

92
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,690
Mr. Benzo, don't you have any idea what's happened?

93
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:32,990
Don't ask me. She never told me anything.

94
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,890
I just hope she hasn't turned into a mermaid like this dead girl.

95
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,490
Mermaid? What do you mean?

96
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,190
Didn't you know? The legendary nun

97
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,290
ate the meat of the mermaid that was caught in the net.

98
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,290
Mermaid?

99
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,590
If the arrow leaves your person, evil will overtake you,

100
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:58,290
women will return to water and become silent mermaids.

101
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,990
Kazuha.

102
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,390
Never mind that, in the morning, let's all go look for Saori.

103
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,690
Kazuha.

104
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,190
Stay close to me.

105
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,190
Heiji.

106
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,090
Later that night,

107
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,290
the police searched everyone at the wake

108
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:26,690
looking for the person who took Nahoko's arrow, but...

109
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,590
The only ones with arrows were Benzo and Kazuha

110
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,290
who won them at the festival.

111
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,390
Kudo, did you find anything out?

112
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,090
No, nothing.

113
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,490
All I know at this point is,

114
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,690
Toshimi, Nahoko and the missing Saori

115
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,790
believed in the powers of the Holy Person

116
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,190
who is said to have eaten mermaid flesh.

117
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,090
Yeah, it's almost abnormal how much they believed it.

118
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:58,190
If we only knew who held what number at last night's festival.

119
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,590
That's easy.

120
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,790
We have everyone sign the list.

121
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,690
Would you like to come with me now and take a look at the list?

122
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,190
Of course.

123
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,390
Watch out.

124
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,690
For goodness sakes, dad. Get a grip on yourself.

125
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,490
Kimie.

126
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,390
I know this is a bad time,

127
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,890
but did you think about what we talked about before?

128
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,490
I'm serious, you know.

129
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,590
I can't. Toshimi's dead, it wouldn't be fair to her.

130
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:32,490
Besides, I have my great-grandmother to take care of,

131
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,390
I can't leave this island.

132
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,890
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,390
Did the 5 of you go to college together too?

134
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,790
Yes.

135
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,390
We all loved watching movies

136
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,390
and joined the movie club in college.

137
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:53,490
We even made a film about the legendary nun.

138
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,990
And it took first place in the film contest,

139
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,890
we were so excited.

140
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,390
We all set our sights on Hollywood.

141
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,990
That's fantastic.

142
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,890
But we all loved this island and ended up coming back.

143
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,490
Who would have dreamed Toshimi and Nahoko would end up like this?

144
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,590
That's strange.

145
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,740
I could have sworn we left them here.

146
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,440
Can't you find them?

147
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,140
No. Only the ones for this year are missing.

148
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,640
Maybe that old lady took them?

149
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,240
She would never do that.

150
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,040
Did anyone else know you kept them there?

151
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,040
Most of the locals knew.

152
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,240
I'll go check the other rooms just in case.

153
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,640
-I'll help you. -Me too.

154
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,040
Thank you.

155
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,040
Wow, look at these names.

156
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,340
A former Foreign Affairs Minister,

157
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,540
a Chief Secretary of the Cabinet

158
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,340
and President of the Bank of Japan.

159
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,240
They all wanted to live a long life, I guess.

160
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,340
Shino Miyano?

161
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:04,340
I'm pretty sure her real name was something like that.

162
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,940
But it couldn't be,

163
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,240
she's not the type to wish for eternal youth and beauty.

164
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,940
What happened?

165
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,240
I saw a brown-haired girl with glasses standing over there.

166
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,540
She was staring at us.

167
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,240
-That's impossible. -Saori was here?

168
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,940
What is this? Why's this glass cracked?

169
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,940
Where's Kimie?

170
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,640
She said she was going to look in the rebuilt warehouse.

171
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,340
Where is it?

172
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,640
I'm pretty sure she said it was behind the shrine.

173
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,440
Hey, what's that? It's awfully bright over there.

174
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,640
It couldn't be...

175
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,340
The fire continued to burn throughout the night

176
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,440
just like 3 years ago, it burnt to the ground.

177
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,840
That's right, it was exactly like the fire 3 years ago.

178
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,240
Including the remains of 1 victim.

179
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,340
A burned body?

180
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,140
That's right, it was burned beyond recognition

181
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,640
but it had glasses on.

182
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,140
You could just barely make out it was wearing blue clothing.

183
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,240
It's probably Saori who was missing.

184
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,640
Then the girl we saw last night was...

185
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,440
A ghost?

186
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,740
Kimie.

187
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,940
Kimie. Where are you, Kimie?

188
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,440
Kimie!

189
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,640
Isn't Kimie back yet?

190
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,640
No, she's not.

191
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,540
I'll go stay with the great-grandmother.

192
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,940
I'll go too.

193
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,540
Hey, Hattori.

194
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,240
Didn't Kimie say she went to the dentist recently?

195
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,140
Yeah, she did.

196
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,940
You don't mean...

197
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,340
Do you know what you're implying?

198
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,740
Don't play dumb.

199
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,140
The same thought passed through your mind too, didn't it?

200
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,940
We both have the same bad feeling about this.

201
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,640
"Half A Day Later" -Yes, I see.

202
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,940
"Half A Day Later" -Thank you very much.

203
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,540
What did you find out?

204
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,640
They compared Kimie's dental records

205
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,240
with the burn victim's teeth and...

206
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,640
They were a perfect match.

207
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,440
-How awful. -Kimie's dead.

208
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,440
I don't believe it. It's all a lie!

209
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
I see.

210
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,640
So Kimie's dead.

211
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,440
We've very sorry.

212
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,840
We lost sight of her for just a moments.

213
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,940
Another young life has been lost

214
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,740
and here I am, still alive at this old age, I'm so ashamed.

215
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,040
I have a question, the mermaid's grave

216
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,540
that you asked someone to help you move into the forest,

217
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,440
who helped you do it?

218
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,240
It won't do you any good to know,

219
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,240
that person's died before me too.

220
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,940
Hey, Pops.

221
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,840
Did you find anything?

222
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,540
Absolutely nothing.

223
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,840
What a complicated case.

224
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,840
We can't even figure out who the killer is,

225
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,240
how can we find a motive for all of this.

226
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,740
On top of that, we don't even know why Kimie was dressed like Saori.

227
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,940
Well, that was probably to make us think it was Saori who died.

228
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,240
Then the killer must be Saori?

229
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,140
Or it could be someone who wants us to think it is.

230
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,640
Is that the ocean?

231
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,240
Yes, the ocean's right behind us.

232
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,640
Last night...

233
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,440
Kimie told us that, last night.

234
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,840
Well, no matter who the killer is, one thing is for sure.

235
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,640
We've got to find the killer as soon as possible,

236
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,940
we can't let such a heartless killer run free.

237
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,840
Dad.

238
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,640
What is it, Ran?

239
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,040
Someone just called Kimie's home,

240
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,240
the caller said something strange.

241
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,740
What do you mean?

242
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,340
The caller said, 'thank you for letting me have the arrow'.

243
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:06,640
'It was worth the 1,000,000. My son's operation was a success'.

244
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,340
Someone bought the arrow?

245
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,840
For 1,000,000?

246
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,940
Yes. The caller said that the other morning, a man who said

247
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,340
he worked at the shrine agreed to sell it as a special favor.

248
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,840
Doesn't that have something to do with the old couple

249
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,640
who cancelled the morning of the festival?

250
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,840
It probably does.

251
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,740
And so, what was the man's name?

252
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,640
I don't know but he was a big man probably in his 50's

253
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,740
and he had a scruffy beard.

254
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,140
Are you sure?

255
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,140
Mr. Benzo?

256
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,240
Hey. If it was before the festival, then that arrow...

257
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,840
More than likely it was the arrow Saori said she lost.

258
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,840
And lucky for Benzo, he won an arrow at the festival

259
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,840
and on top of that, the register with all the names got lost.

260
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,340
Something's going on.

261
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,140
Nahoko, who was killed on the day of Toshimi's wake

262
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,640
also had her arrow stolen.

263
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,340
I'm going to the Ebihara's home where the wake was held.

264
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,640
Kudo... I mean Pops.

265
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,940
Please go and check Benzo's place.

266
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,240
Good grief.

267
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,140
Are you sure about that?

268
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,440
Did you say Benzo left right after us last night?

269
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,140
That's right, he looked scared.

270
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,740
I knew it, Benzo was listening to us.

271
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:24,040
He heard us talking about going with Kimie to check the register.

272
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,040
So he took a shortcut and stole it before we arrived.

273
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,140
Then it was probably Benzo who set fire to warehouse, right?

274
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,340
You're probably right.

275
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,740
If Kimie found him hanging around holding the register...

276
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,040
What're you doing here?

277
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,240
Don't tell me you forgot. You're the one who told to stay close.

278
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,840
Oh, that's right.

279
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,640
Besides, since I have an arrow that's been blessed,

280
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,940
I'm your good luck charm.

281
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,740
You have nothing to worry about, if you're in danger,

282
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,440
I'll protect you.

283
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,640
I'm so lucky.

284
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,240
I'm serious. Heiji.

285
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,340
But now that Kimie's dead,

286
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,140
I guess this will be the last Dugong Festival.

287
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,840
I guess so.

288
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,940
Hey, you.

289
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,740
Can you tell me once more

290
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,140
which footprints are yours and your friends?

291
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,040
Sure, no problem.

292
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,640
What...

293
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,640
What is it, Heiji?

294
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,140
There are scratches on the back of this sandal

295
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,540
and they're still fresh.

296
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,240
Where are the sandals Nahoko was wearing?

297
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,340
They were taken to the Fukui Police Department.

298
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,940
Kazuha, let me see your arrow.

299
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,740
Perfect match.

300
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,440
These are the sandals that stepped on the arrow on the sand.

301
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,440
Which means... what I thought all along...

302
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,640
Rats. I knew it, no one's home.

303
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,140
Hey, what're you people doing here?

304
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:06,340
Well, we wanted to talk to Benzo, do you know where he is?

305
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,040
I haven't seen him since the wake last night.

306
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,340
What a bad timing. We thought at least we could take a look

307
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,040
at the missing Saori's room.

308
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,540
If you want to get inside, take a look under the potted plant.

309
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,240
That's where the key is.

310
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,840
Let's see now.

311
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,040
I found it.

312
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,140
Alright, let's do it.

313
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,040
Are you sure it's alright to go in without permission?

314
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,240
He won't mind, we'll just have a fast look.

315
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,340
Hey, how did Saori act just before she disappeared?

316
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,740
Well, she was scared, even when the ocean got rough,

317
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,940
she said the mermaid was going to punish her.

318
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,340
Punish her?

319
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,840
This is Saori's room.

320
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,440
What's this bag doing here?

321
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,240
I wonder what's inside.

322
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,040
Conan.

323
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,940
Aspirin, toothbrush.

324
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,940
That's Saori's run away from home set.

325
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,940
But then she usually went to Kimie's

326
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,540
so I heard she kept extra clothes and a spare pair of glasses there.

327
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,540
So you mean the clothes Kimie was wearing

328
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,040
when she was found in the warehouse,

329
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,040
she could have put them on herself?

330
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,140
How stupid, why'd she have to go and do that for?

331
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,540
Maybe to lure the killer out.

332
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,940
Just kidding.

333
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,940
That's ridiculous.

334
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:31,640
But if Kimie thought the killer was after Saori too

335
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,440
and if she saw someone suspicious hanging around the house,

336
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,040
she might have done what Conan said

337
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,740
so that she could catch the killer.

338
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,840
You're crazy, last night during the fire,

339
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,340
didn't you say you saw someone who looked like Saori in the yard?

340
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,040
Is there a picture of Saori in this room?

341
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,240
I think there's a photo album around.

342
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,140
Ran. Is this the girl you saw?

343
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,940
I'm not sure, it was pretty dark.

344
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,740
These pictures, are they the ones from when you did the film

345
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,240
on the legendary nun?

346
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
Yes.

347
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,740
Where? Let me see.

348
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,640
Wow, this is something.

349
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,640
It really looks like a mermaid is swimming in the ocean.

350
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,840
It really does, this scene in the storm is so realistic.

351
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,740
Yes, Saori's special effect photography

352
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,740
and Kimie's theatrical makeup techniques

353
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,640
were the main reasons we won first place.

354
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,540
But 1 year after that, there really was a storm

355
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,640
and both Kimie's parents, as well as mine and Saori's mother

356
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,240
were lost at sea.

357
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,240
Not one of us dreamed anything like that would happen.

358
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,440
Wait a minute.

359
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,040
Bank book, cash card, name stamp.

360
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,940
Driver's license and passport are here.

361
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,640
But that thing's not here.

362
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,540
I don't understand.

363
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,040
It can't be?

364
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,040
Hattori here.

365
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,940
Oh, Kudo... I mean, Pops.

366
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:08,240
I was just about to call you.

367
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,540
The sandal we found in the Kadowaki' yard

368
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,140
had scratches on it from stepping on the arrow.

369
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,140
It proves that on the night of the wake,

370
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,240
the killer went to where Nahoko was waiting near the nets

371
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,540
and after killing her, the killer returned to the wake.

372
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:27,740
The only 2 who could have done that were Benzo and Rokuro.

373
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,540
But seeing how upset Rokuro was in the afternoon,

374
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,140
I doubt he'd do anything to hurt Kimie...

375
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,440
Which means the killer is...

376
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,040
Hattori. I'm going to tell you my theory now.

377
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,340
Listen carefully.

378
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,640
Sure, go ahead.

379
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,340
That's ridiculous! It's impossible! I don't believe it!

380
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,640
Hattori.

381
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,840
When we rule out the impossible,

382
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:13,240
only the truth remains, no matter how unbelievable it might seem.

383
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,340
What did you say?

384
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,140
Inspector!

385
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,140
Our men are in the forest tracking down Benzo Kadowaki.

386
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,740
Good. Let's go, men.

387
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,440
After we catch Benzo, I'll go to where you are.

388
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,640
-Wait there for me. -Heiji?

389
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,740
Hey!

390
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,740
I don't want to believe in it either, Hattori.

391
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,840
It's a lie. A lie. It can't be true.

392
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,040
You can't make me believe it, Kudo.

393
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,340
What's that? Do you smell incense?

394
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,640
Idiot.

395
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,240
Who'd be burning incense this deep in the forest?

396
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,340
"Danger - Cliff Ahead"

397
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,740
A grave.

398
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,740
Is this the mermaid's grave?

399
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,540
Wait a minute, then this must mean...

400
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,440
It's like Kudo said after all,

401
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,440
so the murderers who he said it is...

402
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,740
Oh, no.

403
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,240
Oh, no. The cliff.

404
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,640
No...

405
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,840
Kazuha!

406
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,360
Next Conan's Hint:

407
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,160
"Insurance card"

408
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,900
In the next episode, the mystery is solved.

409
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,760
I wonder if Kazuha is all right.

410
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,520
Watch the next episode and find out!
