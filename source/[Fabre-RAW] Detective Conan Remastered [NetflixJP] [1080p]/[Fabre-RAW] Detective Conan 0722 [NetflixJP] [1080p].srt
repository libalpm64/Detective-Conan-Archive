1
00:00:06,355 --> 00:00:08,355
I'm not letting you through!

2
00:00:08,355 --> 00:00:11,155
There...

3
00:00:11,155 --> 00:00:13,455
I'm not letting you overtake me!

4
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:14,755
There...

5
00:00:14,755 --> 00:00:15,995
Oh no!

6
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:17,055
Go after him!

7
00:00:18,455 --> 00:00:19,999
Okay, come!

8
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:21,055
There!

9
00:00:23,255 --> 00:00:25,655
All right! Fourth point!

10
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:27,355
Conan, you're fantastic!

11
00:00:27,355 --> 00:00:28,855
Yes!

12
00:00:28,855 --> 00:00:31,555
No fair.

13
00:00:31,555 --> 00:00:33,655
Maybe there's something wrong with the rule.

14
00:00:33,655 --> 00:00:35,355
What about it is wrong?

15
00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:36,755
We're playing two against one,

16
00:00:36,755 --> 00:00:39,255
and you've got more players on your side!

17
00:00:39,255 --> 00:00:43,055
Besides, I only get to kick with my left leg too.

18
00:00:43,055 --> 00:00:45,455
Then, I guess you'll have to not use your left leg.

19
00:00:45,455 --> 00:00:48,655
Hey... then, all I get to use is my head.

20
00:00:48,655 --> 00:00:50,855
But, if Conan uses his head,

21
00:00:50,855 --> 00:00:52,555
I think we'll be in more trouble.

22
00:00:52,555 --> 00:00:54,455
Then, don't use your head either!

23
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:58,555
Hey... what're you getting all worked up about?

24
00:00:58,555 --> 00:01:01,455
We're just playing to empty our stomach

25
00:01:01,455 --> 00:01:03,655
until the Christmas cake arrives at Doc's house, right?

26
00:01:03,655 --> 00:01:07,155
So, all we have to do is kill time for the next two hours, right?

27
00:01:07,155 --> 00:01:08,047
Go for it!

28
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:09,655
Huh?

29
00:01:09,655 --> 00:01:10,655
Hey, no fair!

30
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:12,655
-Haibara! -Okay!

31
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:13,755
Huh?

32
00:01:13,755 --> 00:01:14,955
Here goes!

33
00:01:14,955 --> 00:01:17,355
Mr. Higo's special play, non-spin!

34
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:23,055
Lucky.

35
00:01:23,055 --> 00:01:25,555
What do you think you're doing, Haibara?

36
00:01:25,555 --> 00:01:29,155
I'm sorry, I should've made a better pass...

37
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:30,069
That's not it.

38
00:01:30,255 --> 00:01:31,255
Huh?

39
00:01:32,355 --> 00:01:34,455
I couldn't kick the ball

40
00:01:34,455 --> 00:01:37,655
because this little one came out in front of the ball.

41
00:01:37,655 --> 00:01:41,355
Yes, come here.

42
00:01:41,355 --> 00:01:43,355
Oh my, how cute!

43
00:01:43,355 --> 00:01:44,455
A cat.

44
00:01:44,455 --> 00:01:46,355
Huh? It's Tai!

45
00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:48,355
Tai?

46
00:01:48,355 --> 00:01:50,655
You know that cat?

47
00:01:50,655 --> 00:01:53,155
Yeah! He's a stray that has a territory

48
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:56,455
around the fifth district where the Mouri Detective Agency is.

49
00:01:56,455 --> 00:01:59,255
He likes Azusa of coffee shop Poirot

50
00:01:59,255 --> 00:02:02,455
and comes to beg for food around sundown.

51
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,355
So, the manager of the coffee shop named him

52
00:02:05,355 --> 00:02:08,955
after the great Detective Poirot's friend, Captain Hasting

53
00:02:08,955 --> 00:02:11,555
because he always hangs around Poirot.

54
00:02:11,555 --> 00:02:14,455
So, that's why his name is Tai!

55
00:02:14,455 --> 00:02:16,955
But, is he really a stray?

56
00:02:16,955 --> 00:02:18,555
He's wearing a collar.

57
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,155
It seems that he belonged to someone before, though.

58
00:02:28,755 --> 00:02:30,155
Your sweater got caught

59
00:02:30,155 --> 00:02:32,855
on the cat's nail and unraveled.

60
00:02:32,855 --> 00:02:34,855
This is handmade, you see.

61
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:38,855
Nevermind that but I wonder where it's going?

62
00:02:38,855 --> 00:02:40,139
It may go out into the road

63
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:42,455
and get run over!

64
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:44,143
Let's go after it!

65
00:02:44,143 --> 00:02:46,145
We'd better hurry.

66
00:03:01,655 --> 00:03:03,455
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

67
00:03:03,455 --> 00:03:05,455
are slashed by the light of deduction.

68
00:03:05,455 --> 00:03:07,055
The members of the detective squad are locked

69
00:03:07,055 --> 00:03:09,155
in a surprising case inside a refrigerated vehicle compartment.

70
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,655
He sees through the one and only truth.

71
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:12,655
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

72
00:03:12,655 --> 00:03:15,255
His name is Detective Conan!

73
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:49,993
"A Sweet, Cold Courier (Part 1)"

74
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:53,393
Where'd it go?

75
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,993
It's nowhere in sight.

76
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:58,277
Oh, there it is!

77
00:04:58,277 --> 00:04:59,193
Behind the car!

78
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:02,281
Oh, yeah!

79
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:04,283
It's in a place like that.

80
00:05:07,493 --> 00:05:09,593
It went inside!

81
00:05:09,593 --> 00:05:11,693
Oh no!

82
00:05:11,693 --> 00:05:12,793
I wonder if it smelt fish or things like that,

83
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:15,993
that are in the back of the truck.

84
00:05:15,993 --> 00:05:18,793
Let's hurry and go get it.

85
00:05:18,793 --> 00:05:20,893
"Cheeta Courier"

86
00:05:21,893 --> 00:05:24,303
The driver's nowhere in sight.

87
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:27,493
Then, we'll just have to go inside and bring it back out.

88
00:05:29,493 --> 00:05:31,593
It's cold.

89
00:05:31,593 --> 00:05:34,313
This seems to be a refrigerated car.

90
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:36,315
Tai, where are you?

91
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:38,093
Tai!

92
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,593
There it is.

93
00:05:44,593 --> 00:05:45,693
Tai.

94
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:50,993
What a troublesome cat.

95
00:05:50,993 --> 00:05:52,331
You can say that again.

96
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:54,093
Okay, let's go, Tai.

97
00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:56,993
Not again. You left the door open again!

98
00:05:56,993 --> 00:05:58,093
Huh?

99
00:05:58,093 --> 00:05:59,393
Oh, sorry.

100
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:00,693
Be careful!

101
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,093
Yeah.

102
00:06:03,993 --> 00:06:05,793
Oh, wait...

103
00:06:05,793 --> 00:06:08,347
Excuse me!

104
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:11,493
I think I heard the voice of a child or something.

105
00:06:11,493 --> 00:06:15,993
I guess you would, because there's a park nearby.

106
00:06:15,993 --> 00:06:17,793
Oh, I guess so.

107
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:26,793
They started off without being aware of us!

108
00:06:26,793 --> 00:06:28,367
We're in trouble!

109
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:29,993
Are we going to freeze too?

110
00:06:29,993 --> 00:06:31,193
Don't worry!

111
00:06:31,193 --> 00:06:32,371
Huh...

112
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:34,793
There are so many undelivered boxes

113
00:06:34,793 --> 00:06:36,893
that are specified to be delivered today, you see.

114
00:06:36,893 --> 00:06:39,093
Let's have the delivery men let us out

115
00:06:39,093 --> 00:06:40,379
when they open the door during the next delivery.

116
00:06:57,593 --> 00:07:00,793
Hey, wait...

117
00:07:12,593 --> 00:07:14,413
It stopped.

118
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:16,793
They'll probably be surprised out of their wits

119
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:19,093
if we come out from inside.

120
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:20,993
But, they'll scold us too.

121
00:07:20,993 --> 00:07:23,093
Well, we did it for a reason,

122
00:07:23,093 --> 00:07:24,893
so if we tell them honestly...

123
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:26,425
No.

124
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:28,693
If you go out now, I'll never forgive you!

125
00:07:31,293 --> 00:07:33,593
Just what are you doing?

126
00:07:33,593 --> 00:07:35,493
In just your underwear?

127
00:07:35,493 --> 00:07:36,893
The yarn of my sweater got caught onto something

128
00:07:36,893 --> 00:07:38,437
and my sweater unraveled.

129
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:40,439
So, it's gone.

130
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:42,193
Don't shine the light on me.

131
00:07:42,193 --> 00:07:43,393
Oh, sorry.

132
00:07:45,393 --> 00:07:46,793
Oh, here they come.

133
00:07:46,793 --> 00:07:48,893
Let's hide!

134
00:07:52,193 --> 00:07:54,093
Hey! Just what're you doing?

135
00:07:54,093 --> 00:07:56,093
Hurry up and make the delivery.

136
00:07:56,093 --> 00:07:59,593
I still think I hear voices from inside.

137
00:07:59,593 --> 00:08:01,693
You idiot, why would you?

138
00:08:01,693 --> 00:08:03,393
That's true.

139
00:08:03,393 --> 00:08:04,463
Hurry it up, will you?

140
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:05,993
Yeah.

141
00:08:07,393 --> 00:08:10,469
The next delivery is...

142
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:13,993
The Sasagawa residence, at Beika condominium room 205!

143
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,193
Yes... the Sasagawa residence.

144
00:08:17,193 --> 00:08:19,193
Oh, here it is...

145
00:08:19,193 --> 00:08:22,993
This is the one. Assorted fruits.

146
00:08:22,993 --> 00:08:25,293
Hurry and delivery it then.

147
00:08:25,293 --> 00:08:27,593
Drop the delivery at the entrance,

148
00:08:27,593 --> 00:08:30,993
so that the resident will remember your face and name.

149
00:08:30,993 --> 00:08:34,093
The resident is an important witness, you see.

150
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:37,393
-Witness? -Yeah, I know.

151
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:40,499
In the mean time, I'll go borrow the men's room again

152
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:43,193
at a nearby convenience store.

153
00:08:43,193 --> 00:08:45,993
Hey, don't you think we should check inside

154
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:47,693
the back of the truck just in case?

155
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,293
I'm concerned about the voices I hear.

156
00:08:50,293 --> 00:08:52,511
I'm telling you to not worry about it.

157
00:08:52,693 --> 00:08:54,513
But...

158
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:56,515
Don't get chicken!

159
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:58,993
He could never let out a sound.

160
00:09:01,393 --> 00:09:04,523
Can't make a sound?

161
00:09:06,293 --> 00:09:08,793
Come on, hurry it up, will you?

162
00:09:08,793 --> 00:09:10,529
Yeah.

163
00:09:15,793 --> 00:09:17,693
The two just now...

164
00:09:17,693 --> 00:09:19,393
Don't tell me that they...

165
00:09:22,293 --> 00:09:25,593
Please wear my jacket for the time being.

166
00:09:25,593 --> 00:09:27,593
Thank you, you're a life-saver.

167
00:09:27,593 --> 00:09:28,547
You're welcome.

168
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:31,693
We'd better hurry on out of here,

169
00:09:31,693 --> 00:09:33,993
or we'll all catch cold.

170
00:09:33,993 --> 00:09:35,693
Don't worry.

171
00:09:35,693 --> 00:09:37,793
I can go out now since I'm wearing this.

172
00:09:37,793 --> 00:09:38,993
True!

173
00:09:38,993 --> 00:09:41,093
But, all you're wearing is a jacket,

174
00:09:41,093 --> 00:09:42,561
so would you like to carry Tai?

175
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:43,993
He's warm.

176
00:09:43,993 --> 00:09:45,893
Yes, I guess so.

177
00:09:45,893 --> 00:09:48,567
So, the next time the men open the door,

178
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:50,569
let's have them let us out!

179
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:51,393
Yeah...

180
00:09:51,393 --> 00:09:54,193
No, I don't think we should.

181
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,093
Huh...

182
00:09:56,093 --> 00:09:58,093
It seems somebody else...

183
00:09:58,093 --> 00:10:00,579
was already on this truck before us.

184
00:10:08,193 --> 00:10:10,093
Just what do you mean?

185
00:10:10,093 --> 00:10:11,693
I wonder...

186
00:10:11,693 --> 00:10:13,693
I don't know who or where he came from,

187
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:16,893
nor do I know why he was killed,

188
00:10:16,893 --> 00:10:21,793
but I'm sure that the ones who did it are the two delivery men.

189
00:10:21,793 --> 00:10:23,193
What...

190
00:10:23,193 --> 00:10:24,993
Are you serious?

191
00:10:24,993 --> 00:10:28,607
But why is he in the back of the truck like this?

192
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:31,893
Because this truck is equipped with a refrigeration device.

193
00:10:31,893 --> 00:10:33,593
Leaving him in here

194
00:10:33,593 --> 00:10:35,493
would delay the decaying process of the corpse,

195
00:10:35,493 --> 00:10:38,293
thus, also delay the estimated time of death.

196
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:40,193
Even if they were to drop him off somewhere later

197
00:10:40,193 --> 00:10:42,093
and he's found,

198
00:10:42,093 --> 00:10:43,193
the two would've been working busily

199
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:47,193
during the time of the crime.

200
00:10:47,193 --> 00:10:49,693
They deliberately wanted to take the delivery to the front door

201
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:51,093
so that they could leave an impression

202
00:10:51,093 --> 00:10:53,793
of their face and name to the resident,

203
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:56,635
because so that later when questioned by the police,

204
00:10:56,793 --> 00:10:58,393
the resident would testify

205
00:10:58,393 --> 00:11:00,639
that they certainly made the delivery at that time.

206
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:03,093
Borrowing the men's room frequently,

207
00:11:03,093 --> 00:11:04,643
his face would show up on the surveillance camera

208
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:05,993
and serve as an alibi.

209
00:11:05,993 --> 00:11:07,593
No one would suspect him

210
00:11:07,593 --> 00:11:10,649
if he says that he had an upset stomach or something.

211
00:11:10,893 --> 00:11:12,093
Besides, look.

212
00:11:13,893 --> 00:11:17,093
The cardboard box that the corpse is inside.

213
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,293
The corners are squashed

214
00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:20,659
and the sides are dirty too, right?

215
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:23,993
They deliberately rolled the box with the corpse inside,

216
00:11:23,993 --> 00:11:26,193
so that livor mortis won't be conspicuous.

217
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:28,193
Hey, wait a minute.

218
00:11:28,193 --> 00:11:31,193
Are you saying that if the two men find us here...

219
00:11:31,193 --> 00:11:32,393
Yeah.

220
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:36,675
All five of us will probably be locked in here.

221
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:38,677
So that they can freeze us to death.

222
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:41,293
No way...

223
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:43,393
Isn't there anything we can do?

224
00:11:43,393 --> 00:11:45,093
Why don't we burst through the door

225
00:11:45,093 --> 00:11:47,393
as soon as it opens?

226
00:11:47,393 --> 00:11:49,493
It won't work.

227
00:11:49,493 --> 00:11:52,393
If under normal circumstances, maybe,

228
00:11:52,393 --> 00:11:53,993
but with this stiff body,

229
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:55,993
I don't think it's possible

230
00:11:55,993 --> 00:11:57,793
for all of us to make it outside.

231
00:11:57,793 --> 00:12:00,493
Well, don't worry.

232
00:12:00,493 --> 00:12:05,393
Let us deliver those two men...

233
00:12:05,393 --> 00:12:08,393
To prison.

234
00:12:19,337 --> 00:12:21,237
And...

235
00:12:21,237 --> 00:12:22,721
What're we going to do?

236
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:24,337
Just how do you intend

237
00:12:24,337 --> 00:12:26,237
to nab the two delivery men?

238
00:12:26,237 --> 00:12:28,337
Please tell us, Conan!

239
00:12:28,337 --> 00:12:31,437
We're not going to nab them.

240
00:12:31,437 --> 00:12:33,637
We're going to have an outsider nab them.

241
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:34,733
Huh...

242
00:12:34,937 --> 00:12:36,735
The cell phone.

243
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:40,337
We'll use it to call Officer Takagi at MPD.

244
00:12:41,437 --> 00:12:44,537
We'll tell him that the delivery men of the Cheeta Courier are evil

245
00:12:44,537 --> 00:12:46,037
and that they have a corpse

246
00:12:46,037 --> 00:12:47,837
in the refrigerated compartment of their truck.

247
00:12:47,837 --> 00:12:50,737
We'll tell him that we're locked in the compartment too,

248
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,137
so to set up a checkpoint

249
00:12:52,137 --> 00:12:56,237
and check the compartment of the delivery truck.

250
00:12:56,237 --> 00:12:58,757
I memorized then license plate of the truck,

251
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:00,237
so everything should work out fine.

252
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,437
What...

253
00:13:01,437 --> 00:13:02,761
You're going to make a call?

254
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:05,237
I thought you had a more far out idea.

255
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:08,767
Well, in this situation,

256
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:11,637
I guess there's nothing more that can be done, is there?

257
00:13:11,637 --> 00:13:12,771
That's right...

258
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:15,537
So, will one of you lend me your cell phone?

259
00:13:15,537 --> 00:13:18,777
I'm charging my cell at Doc's place.

260
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:21,237
I left mine at Doc's house too.

261
00:13:21,237 --> 00:13:24,437
I didn't want to drop mine when playing soccer so...

262
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:26,785
I did bring mine along,

263
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:29,937
but just a little while ago, the charge buzzer sounded,

264
00:13:29,937 --> 00:13:31,637
so I don't know if it'd be of any use.

265
00:13:31,637 --> 00:13:33,437
Lend it to me, will you?

266
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,837
I'll revive the battery.

267
00:13:35,837 --> 00:13:38,797
-Huh? -Revive the battery?

268
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:40,337
Can you do something like that?

269
00:13:40,337 --> 00:13:44,237
Yeah, you take the battery out like this

270
00:13:46,437 --> 00:13:47,737
The voltage rises a bit

271
00:13:47,737 --> 00:13:49,737
and you can use it for a little while move.

272
00:13:51,337 --> 00:13:53,437
Well, I'm sure that it'll be enough

273
00:13:53,437 --> 00:13:56,137
to explain this situation to Officer Takagi.

274
00:13:56,137 --> 00:13:58,137
Oh, it the sound of brakes!

275
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,537
Those guys are going to come back in.

276
00:14:00,537 --> 00:14:01,837
-Let's hide. -Okay...

277
00:14:03,037 --> 00:14:05,437
We've gotta watch out.

278
00:14:16,837 --> 00:14:19,837
The only delivery we have for the fourth district

279
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:22,537
are the Yamada and Nishino residence?

280
00:14:22,537 --> 00:14:23,837
Yeah.

281
00:14:26,237 --> 00:14:27,837
But, before that,

282
00:14:27,837 --> 00:14:30,337
it's about time we move the box with the corpse inside.

283
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:32,137
I guess so.

284
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,437
It's already been about two hours.

285
00:14:36,037 --> 00:14:39,437
Here goes...

286
00:14:39,437 --> 00:14:42,437
Okay, now it'll keep for another two hours

287
00:14:42,437 --> 00:14:45,237
without livor mortis appearing.

288
00:14:45,237 --> 00:14:46,865
What's wrong?

289
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:50,637
It looks like the masking tape had been pulled off once.

290
00:14:50,637 --> 00:14:51,737
Huh?

291
00:14:51,737 --> 00:14:54,537
You idiot! Just who are you saying pulled it off.

292
00:14:55,737 --> 00:14:57,637
-Oh, no. -What...

293
00:14:57,637 --> 00:14:59,937
I thought I just heard a cat...

294
00:14:59,937 --> 00:15:03,437
Heck, what's with you anyway?

295
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:06,137
First, you say you hear the voices of kids,

296
00:15:06,137 --> 00:15:07,637
then now you say you hear a cat?

297
00:15:07,637 --> 00:15:09,337
But...

298
00:15:09,337 --> 00:15:11,737
Well, you did kill a person,

299
00:15:11,737 --> 00:15:14,237
so I can understand you feeling uncomfortable.

300
00:15:14,237 --> 00:15:16,037
I'm really sorry

301
00:15:16,037 --> 00:15:18,897
that things had to turn out this way just because of me.

302
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:20,437
It can't be helped.

303
00:15:20,437 --> 00:15:22,437
It coincidentally turned out that the house you made a delivery to

304
00:15:22,437 --> 00:15:24,903
was the of the husband of the woman you were having an affair with,

305
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:28,037
and he snapped and attacked you

306
00:15:28,037 --> 00:15:30,637
saying that you were to blame for him getting a divorce.

307
00:15:30,637 --> 00:15:32,937
I had no intention of killing him.

308
00:15:32,937 --> 00:15:35,837
I tried to pull free from his grasp and knocked him down.

309
00:15:35,837 --> 00:15:37,537
He hit his head somewhere

310
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,737
and stopped moving completely.

311
00:15:39,737 --> 00:15:42,937
Well, you did then right thing

312
00:15:42,937 --> 00:15:44,923
to call me before contacting the police.

313
00:15:45,137 --> 00:15:47,237
We did get a hold of the wallet

314
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,437
with a lot of cash in it too, besides.

315
00:15:49,437 --> 00:15:52,937
But, are you sure nobody's going to find out?

316
00:15:52,937 --> 00:15:54,637
Don't worry.

317
00:15:54,637 --> 00:15:55,837
After a while, we'll take the corpse back

318
00:15:55,837 --> 00:15:59,437
to his house where he previously was and leave him there.

319
00:15:59,437 --> 00:16:02,637
After some time, we'll go back to his place

320
00:16:02,637 --> 00:16:04,237
and contact the police telling them

321
00:16:04,237 --> 00:16:06,037
that we just found the body.

322
00:16:06,037 --> 00:16:07,937
Then, everything will be okay.

323
00:16:07,937 --> 00:16:10,337
I guess so.

324
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:13,537
Well, we could crack a window glass

325
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:16,337
to make them think that he was robbed and attacked.

326
00:16:18,037 --> 00:16:20,959
After all, we've got loads of people

327
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,961
to prove our alibi.

328
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:23,837
Yeah.

329
00:16:27,437 --> 00:16:28,967
I see.

330
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:32,037
So, it turned out to be a homicide.

331
00:16:32,037 --> 00:16:34,437
At any rate, let's report this to Officer Takagi.

332
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:40,537
We will be taking off soon.

333
00:16:40,537 --> 00:16:42,537
Please switch off your cell phones,

334
00:16:42,537 --> 00:16:48,037
laptops game and electronic devices etc.

335
00:16:48,037 --> 00:16:50,137
I am sorry.

336
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:51,437
I was trying to confirm the vicinity

337
00:16:51,437 --> 00:16:52,991
of the Kyoto Prefectural Police area

338
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,993
where we're supposed to go pick up the suspect,

339
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:56,537
but how am I supposed to switch this off?

340
00:16:56,537 --> 00:16:59,837
Push the power switch down for a while!

341
00:17:02,137 --> 00:17:05,937
All because you bought a smartphone trying to look edgy.

342
00:17:05,937 --> 00:17:08,037
Did you switch yours off already?

343
00:17:08,037 --> 00:17:10,537
Yes! For some time already!

344
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:14,737
The number you have called

345
00:17:14,737 --> 00:17:17,637
is out of service range or switched off.

346
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:21,019
So, your call cannot be completed.

347
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:22,737
No good, I can't get through.

348
00:17:22,737 --> 00:17:24,037
No.

349
00:17:24,037 --> 00:17:25,437
I've got no choice.

350
00:17:25,437 --> 00:17:28,337
I'll call Doc and explain our situation.

351
00:17:31,937 --> 00:17:34,837
Oh, yes, this is Agasa.

352
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:36,837
Doc? It's me.

353
00:17:36,837 --> 00:17:38,637
Jot down what I'm about to tell you.

354
00:17:38,637 --> 00:17:40,137
Oh, I'm sorry.

355
00:17:40,137 --> 00:17:42,537
My hands are tied just yet.

356
00:17:42,537 --> 00:17:44,037
Hold on a minute.

357
00:17:44,037 --> 00:17:46,037
-Hey! -Hot!

358
00:17:46,037 --> 00:17:48,437
What's cooking?

359
00:17:48,437 --> 00:17:50,837
Okay.

360
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:53,437
Hello, sorry to keep you waiting.

361
00:17:53,437 --> 00:17:55,437
I though just cake wouldn't be enough,

362
00:17:55,437 --> 00:17:57,637
so I was deep frying doughnuts.

363
00:17:57,637 --> 00:17:59,537
Well, it won't be as good

364
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:02,837
as the exclusive Christmas cake from the famous shop, but...

365
00:18:04,137 --> 00:18:06,737
Huh? He hung up.

366
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:08,137
Well, if it's anything important,

367
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:10,737
I guess he'll call back.

368
00:18:10,737 --> 00:18:13,637
Darn, the battery's run out.

369
00:18:13,637 --> 00:18:15,937
Then, maybe if you warm it up again...

370
00:18:15,937 --> 00:18:17,937
Once the battery's completely used up,

371
00:18:17,937 --> 00:18:20,337
warming it up is not going to revive it.

372
00:18:20,337 --> 00:18:22,837
So, what now?

373
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:26,737
You guys, put out what you have in front of me.

374
00:18:26,737 --> 00:18:29,087
I'll try thinking whether I can do something using them.

375
00:18:29,337 --> 00:18:32,137
Okay...

376
00:18:33,437 --> 00:18:38,837
I have a handkerchief, pocket tissue,

377
00:18:38,837 --> 00:18:41,099
candy and a cotton swab.

378
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:42,337
The cotton swab is what was left

379
00:18:42,337 --> 00:18:45,637
after mommy cleaned my ears for me this morning.

380
00:18:45,637 --> 00:18:49,107
It's not used, so don't worry.

381
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:51,109
-How about you, Genta? -I...

382
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:54,537
I have a band-aid, chocolate bar,

383
00:18:54,537 --> 00:18:57,637
and anti-itching ointment for frost bites.

384
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,837
Anti-itching ointment?

385
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:02,237
Oh, I never got frost bites,

386
00:19:02,237 --> 00:19:05,537
but mom kept nagging me to keep it with me.

387
00:19:05,537 --> 00:19:06,637
And, what about you, Mitsuhiko?

388
00:19:06,637 --> 00:19:09,127
I...

389
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:12,237
A memo pad, a bal point pen to go with it,

390
00:19:12,237 --> 00:19:16,337
handkerchief, a wallet, and a taxi receipt.

391
00:19:16,337 --> 00:19:18,237
A taxi receipt?

392
00:19:18,237 --> 00:19:21,437
Yes. When I woke up and was washing my face,

393
00:19:21,437 --> 00:19:24,337
I found it on the floor near the washing machine.

394
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:27,437
Mother probably wanting to wash father's clothes,

395
00:19:27,437 --> 00:19:31,149
checked the pocket and it dropped out.

396
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:34,437
I forgot to give it back to mother.

397
00:19:34,437 --> 00:19:38,437
Next the only thing I have left is the jacket I lent Haibara.

398
00:19:38,437 --> 00:19:41,637
I wore it right after it came back from the cleaners

399
00:19:41,637 --> 00:19:43,837
that I don't think there's anything inside.

400
00:19:43,837 --> 00:19:46,537
How about you, Haibara? Do you have anything?

401
00:19:46,537 --> 00:19:47,737
Huh?

402
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:48,937
Oh, that's right.

403
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,169
You only have underwear on you.

404
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:52,137
Shut up.

405
00:19:56,737 --> 00:20:01,179
But, I don't think you can do with these things.

406
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:03,737
How about writing help on a paper

407
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:05,183
from Mitsuhiko's memo pad,

408
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:09,187
tearing it off and dropping out of the car?

409
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:11,537
Oh, that sounds good.

410
00:20:11,537 --> 00:20:12,937
With that much space under the door,

411
00:20:12,937 --> 00:20:15,193
it looks like we can push a paper through.

412
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:19,197
But even if someone were to pick it up,

413
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:22,537
there's no guarantee that they'll call the police right away.

414
00:20:22,537 --> 00:20:26,037
Besides, if we can get the paper outside, it'll be okay,

415
00:20:26,037 --> 00:20:27,205
but if it gets stuck and we can't get it outside,

416
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:28,837
that's it for us.

417
00:20:28,837 --> 00:20:32,437
The next time the delivery men open the back door of the truck

418
00:20:32,437 --> 00:20:35,237
and find the paper stuck to the door,

419
00:20:35,237 --> 00:20:39,217
they'll find out that someone is inside.

420
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:40,337
I see.

421
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:42,037
Then, what're we going to do?

422
00:20:42,037 --> 00:20:44,737
-Beats me. -What do you mean, beats me?

423
00:20:47,637 --> 00:20:50,537
You sure are easygoing, aren't you?

424
00:20:50,537 --> 00:20:51,837
If only you didn't jump into

425
00:20:51,837 --> 00:20:55,233
the back of this truck to begin with...

426
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:00,937
If I remember correctly, this cat...

427
00:21:02,837 --> 00:21:05,737
I get it! There's a way.

428
00:21:05,737 --> 00:21:09,737
No, but I guess that's too far-fetched.

429
00:21:09,737 --> 00:21:12,037
What? If you came up with something,

430
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,251
tell us about it.

431
00:21:13,437 --> 00:21:16,037
Huh?

432
00:21:16,037 --> 00:21:19,257
The stop that this delivery truck made just before now

433
00:21:19,257 --> 00:21:21,259
was at Beika Condo in the third district.

434
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:24,337
The two houses that they stopped at now was in the fourth district.

435
00:21:24,337 --> 00:21:25,937
So, the next stop would be?

436
00:21:25,937 --> 00:21:28,837
The fifth district?

437
00:21:28,837 --> 00:21:29,937
Right.

438
00:21:29,937 --> 00:21:32,337
The territory of this cat, Tai.

439
00:21:33,437 --> 00:21:36,137
The fifth district where he goes to beg for food

440
00:21:36,137 --> 00:21:38,437
at coffee shop Poirot.

441
00:21:38,437 --> 00:21:39,637
I see!

442
00:21:39,637 --> 00:21:40,837
You're going to make Tai go

443
00:21:40,837 --> 00:21:43,281
and deliver a note that asks help for us!

444
00:21:43,281 --> 00:21:44,937
If we stick it in between its collar,

445
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:47,285
I'm sure Azusa will notice it!

446
00:21:47,537 --> 00:21:49,287
Let's do it!

447
00:21:49,287 --> 00:21:50,637
Yeah.

448
00:21:50,637 --> 00:21:52,337
But...

449
00:21:52,337 --> 00:21:54,637
If those two men catch Tai

450
00:21:54,637 --> 00:21:58,237
and see the paper attached to its collar...

451
00:21:58,237 --> 00:22:00,637
I've already figured that part out too.

452
00:22:00,637 --> 00:22:02,337
Huh?

453
00:22:02,337 --> 00:22:04,637
I'll think up a code that they won't figure out

454
00:22:04,637 --> 00:22:07,305
even if they were to see it.

455
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:09,307
A code?

456
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,180
Next Conan's Hint:

457
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,500
"Christmas Cake"

458
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:53,000
I'd like chocolate.

459
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,220
Cake doesn't seem to go well with you.

460
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,420
Do you want to be hit again?
