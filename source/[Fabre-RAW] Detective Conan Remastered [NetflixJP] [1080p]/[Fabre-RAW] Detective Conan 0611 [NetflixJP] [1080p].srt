1
00:00:14,702 --> 00:00:17,302
Hey. Gramps!

2
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,001
I think there's a residence called Inbushi near here,

3
00:00:22,202 --> 00:00:23,502
but do you know where it is?

4
00:00:23,502 --> 00:00:25,502
Inubushi?

5
00:00:25,502 --> 00:00:28,007
What do you want with them?

6
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:32,902
We're going over to help them get rid of a puppy's curse.

7
00:00:32,902 --> 00:00:35,102
I'll be frank with you.

8
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:37,202
Forget it.

9
00:00:37,202 --> 00:00:40,302
If you stick nose into it out of curiosity,

10
00:00:40,302 --> 00:00:42,702
you'll be badly burned.

11
00:00:43,802 --> 00:00:47,002
And? Where's the house?

12
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:49,702
You see that house with the castle-like roof

13
00:00:49,702 --> 00:00:53,702
part way up that mountain?

14
00:00:53,702 --> 00:00:56,502
That's the Inubushi Residence.

15
00:00:57,802 --> 00:01:01,402
It's a house cursed by a dog.

16
00:01:03,102 --> 00:01:05,002
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

17
00:01:05,002 --> 00:01:07,502
Tears are the start of all dramas.

18
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:09,302
What lies behind the mystery of the burning dog

19
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:11,102
that attacks the cursed Inubushi family?

20
00:01:11,102 --> 00:01:12,702
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:12,702 --> 00:01:14,702
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:14,702 --> 00:01:17,302
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

23
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,841
This is a case that Heiji Hattori had brought along.

24
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:03,441
The adopted children of Mr. Tsunechika Inubushi,

25
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:07,341
the chairman of the Inubushi Group, who died five years ago,

26
00:03:07,341 --> 00:03:10,169
begin dying of bizarre causes one after the other.

27
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:12,171
Moreover, it is said that these are the doings

28
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:15,241
of a monster who resembles a dog enveloped in flames.

29
00:03:15,241 --> 00:03:16,175
Since one of the adopted children

30
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:18,641
was Kazuha's mother's acquaintance,

31
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:21,741
we went along with Heiji to ask for the details.

32
00:03:21,741 --> 00:03:23,041
Surprisingly, the person we went to visit,

33
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:24,741
although the Japanese characters were different,

34
00:03:24,741 --> 00:03:27,841
was named Shinichi Kudo, and had the same name as me.

35
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:31,841
However, even before we got a chance to talk to him,

36
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:34,641
somebody had killed and framed him

37
00:03:34,641 --> 00:03:37,241
as having committed suicide using a charcoal stove.

38
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:39,341
What on earth is the identity of the culprit

39
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:41,341
who dares to act as a possessed spirit?

40
00:03:41,341 --> 00:03:44,541
And what is the meaning of the pearl

41
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,641
that Shinichi s corpse had in his mouth.

42
00:03:49,341 --> 00:03:52,211
"Inubushi Castle, The Ablazed Demon Dog"

43
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,241
"(Will-O'-the-Wisp Chapter)"

44
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:58,641
Hey, Heiji. Is it true?

45
00:03:58,641 --> 00:04:00,841
That story about the pearl that dropped out of the mouth

46
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,041
of the corpse of one of the

47
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,441
adopted children of the Inbushi family, called Shinichi.

48
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:07,341
It's true.

49
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:09,741
He probably bit off the pearl

50
00:04:09,741 --> 00:04:12,241
that was attached to his necktie pin just before he died

51
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:14,941
with hope of leaving behind proof of the culprit.

52
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:16,235
Right?

53
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:19,741
If the saliva of that man is also on the necktie pin,

54
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:22,841
it could be a dying message.

55
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:26,245
It could be. You mean it's not definite?

56
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:29,041
No. Although saliva was found on it,

57
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,341
there is no trace of him having bitten it.

58
00:04:31,341 --> 00:04:33,241
So, maybe the pearl

59
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:37,141
wasn't attached well enough to begin with or...

60
00:04:37,141 --> 00:04:39,741
The culprit had a message he wanted to relay

61
00:04:39,741 --> 00:04:43,241
and deliberately put the pearl into his mouth.

62
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,441
Right, big brother Heiji?

63
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:46,841
Right!

64
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,641
You two sure get along like always!

65
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:53,141
Really, it's just like you're Heiji's assistant!

66
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:54,941
Cut out that assistant stuff.

67
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:57,441
Either way, it's the doing of someone

68
00:04:57,441 --> 00:05:00,541
who has a whole of grudge against the Inubushi family.

69
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:04,041
After all, Shinichi after giving up his portion of the inheritance

70
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:08,287
returned to Tokyo, and yet was killed.

71
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:12,291
Right. Satomi, the wife of elderly tycoon,

72
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,741
Tsunechika Inubushi, inherits his estate,

73
00:05:13,741 --> 00:05:16,641
then falls ill.

74
00:05:16,641 --> 00:05:18,941
If someone is trying to get rid of the number of adopted children

75
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:22,301
in order to increase the amount of the inheritance to be inherited,

76
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:24,041
Shinichi would've been counted out

77
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,541
because he gave up his portion.

78
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,307
If I remember correctly, he had eight adopted children, right?

79
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:31,541
Yes, although they all had different mothers.

80
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,541
So, it could be that a person

81
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,841
who is not his real child among the eight children,

82
00:05:35,841 --> 00:05:38,641
and is trying to clear a grudge or something?

83
00:05:38,641 --> 00:05:40,741
Even if it were to be his real child,

84
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,321
maybe that person could also be holding a grudge

85
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:45,241
because he left them be without looking after them.

86
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:49,141
And, who of the eight passed away?

87
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:52,331
Shinichi who was killed under the pretense

88
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,341
of having committed suicide by using a charcoal stove.

89
00:05:55,341 --> 00:05:57,641
Before that, a lady by the name of Miwako

90
00:05:57,641 --> 00:05:59,641
who drowned in the swamp.

91
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:01,341
The grass around the swamp where there was nothing

92
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:03,341
that could've caught fire seems to have burned.

93
00:06:03,341 --> 00:06:05,941
And the first one who died was a man called Keiji,

94
00:06:05,941 --> 00:06:07,641
"Keiji Inubushi" -who fell from on top a cliff!

95
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:10,941
It's said that he was chased by a demon dog engulfed in flames!

96
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:17,241
If you're scared, you should've stayed back home.

97
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:19,841
But if you hear the start of a scary story,

98
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:21,741
you want to find out what happens in the end.

99
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:25,241
I thought the same too, but I'm scared after all.

100
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:28,367
Hey, it's too late to say you want to go back from here, you know.

101
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:29,941
No! Go back!

102
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:32,741
There's a cliff up ahead so you'd better stop quickly!

103
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,741
What?

104
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:47,141
Look out.

105
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:49,741
Didn't you see the sign a little way back?

106
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:51,441
Be careful, will you?

107
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:54,141
Just the other day, somebody fell over and died too!

108
00:06:54,141 --> 00:06:55,441
Oh, well...

109
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:57,041
we're on our way to investigate that case

110
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,341
and are headed for the Inubushi Residence.

111
00:06:59,341 --> 00:07:00,399
"Miyuki Inubushi(28), Adopted Child of Inubushi"

112
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,403
I'm a family member of the Inubushi's.

113
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:10,741
It really looks like a Japanese castle.

114
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:14,413
It seems that the people around here call it the Inubushi Castle.

115
00:07:14,641 --> 00:07:18,741
It doesn't look like a residence that is cursed by a demon dog!

116
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:20,841
I guess not.

117
00:07:23,741 --> 00:07:24,941
What?

118
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:31,141
-How cute. -It's an Akita dog!

119
00:07:31,141 --> 00:07:32,841
No, Hachi!

120
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:35,241
These people and the others officers who have come here

121
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:38,741
to investigate the accident big brother Keiji got into.

122
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:42,241
No, I'm not an officer.

123
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:45,341
You're the one that's no good, Miyuki!

124
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:48,041
When dogs bark for nothing, calling their name

125
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,641
"Takako Inubushi (47)" -or touching them

126
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:52,441
will make them mistakenly think that they're being praised.

127
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:54,453
How many times do I have to tell you before you understand this?

128
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:58,141
I'm sorry, Takako.

129
00:07:58,141 --> 00:08:01,141
Never mind that, what did you want, officer?

130
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:03,041
Just the other day, another police officer

131
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,141
came and left after saying that

132
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:06,741
it was concluded to be an accident.

133
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:08,467
Oh, well, I'm not an officer.

134
00:08:08,641 --> 00:08:11,941
However, something that doesn't look like an accident occurred,

135
00:08:11,941 --> 00:08:15,541
so we've come all this way to ask you about it!

136
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:18,141
-Right, officer? -You.

137
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:23,841
Could you be talking of Shinichi who died in Tokyo?

138
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:27,241
Before he left here, Shinichi said,

139
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:28,841
a bunch of nonsense about somebody

140
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,641
using a cursed demon dog that is engulfed in flames

141
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:33,141
to annihilate the bloodline of Inubushi from its roots.

142
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:35,241
Is that what you're referring to?

143
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:39,041
But there's no such thing as a curse, so no need for worry.

144
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:43,441
Besides, if mother hears of this, it will make her sad.

145
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:46,505
Is Satomi here?

146
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:49,041
I was under the impression that she'd be in the hospital.

147
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,509
She's here.

148
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:54,141
Although she's bed-ridden and can hardly talk.

149
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,041
Cerebral infarction.

150
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:02,241
She's been this way, ever since she collapsed last month.

151
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:05,041
It's better for her to be hospitalized.

152
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,525
But, since she's already quite aged,

153
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:08,527
we decided to take care of her here.

154
00:09:08,741 --> 00:09:12,141
Oh, I'm Tomoaki Inubushi.

155
00:09:12,141 --> 00:09:15,741
I work as a doctor at the Inubushi Hospital near here.

156
00:09:15,741 --> 00:09:19,241
Then, are you one of the eight adopted children too?

157
00:09:19,241 --> 00:09:21,741
Yes. When I was at a loss what to do

158
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:24,543
after the hospital that I previously worked for went bankrupt,

159
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:27,741
Mother Satomi here came to my rescue.

160
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:28,547
And?

161
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:30,549
Didn't Satomi mention anything about

162
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:33,041
who seemed to be an imposter?

163
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:36,241
I wonder... not especially.

164
00:09:37,341 --> 00:09:41,241
Wasn't that man called Shinichi the imposter?

165
00:09:41,241 --> 00:09:44,141
Terrified over a demon dog rumor that could never be,

166
00:09:44,141 --> 00:09:47,841
he's a betrayer who left the Inubushi house, you see!

167
00:09:47,841 --> 00:09:50,569
How could you talk rough like that Yoshiya,

168
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:52,341
in front of mother!

169
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:56,341
She's not listening. She's asleep, isn't she?

170
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:58,141
One person is missing.

171
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:02,841
The eight adopted children! Three died, right?

172
00:10:02,841 --> 00:10:04,841
So there should be five people left.

173
00:10:04,841 --> 00:10:09,841
But over here there are only Miyuki, Takako, Tomoaki

174
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:12,591
and the one who just came Yoshiya, a total of four people!

175
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:15,641
True. There should be one more person.

176
00:10:15,641 --> 00:10:18,341
Don't tell me that the person has a scar on the face

177
00:10:18,341 --> 00:10:21,141
and wears a strange looking mask?

178
00:10:21,141 --> 00:10:23,641
This isn't the Inugami family, you know.

179
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:25,641
The other one left is Saki!

180
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:27,541
She's picking up some clothes

181
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,241
at a cleaners a little far from here for me.

182
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:33,541
Well, why not drink some tea while you wait for her?

183
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,441
I guess it's difficult to listen to our story

184
00:10:35,441 --> 00:10:37,841
unless all of us are gathered here, so...

185
00:10:37,841 --> 00:10:40,241
While you're at it, why don't you tell them

186
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:41,241
about the demon dog story

187
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,441
that is handed down for generations in the Inubushi family?

188
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:44,941
Handed down for generations?

189
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:50,341
Burned it?

190
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:52,631
The ancestors of this house burned a dog?

191
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:56,141
Yes. It seems to date back to the Meiji Era, though.

192
00:10:56,141 --> 00:10:59,041
All of the townspeople were helping to look for the only daughter

193
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,241
of the Inubushi family, who suddenly disappeared,

194
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:04,643
when the dog that the Inubushi family were keeping appeared

195
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:06,441
holding the daughter who was all scratched up

196
00:11:06,441 --> 00:11:08,341
and on the verge of death in its mouth.

197
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:12,341
The angry owner whipped the dog repeatedly

198
00:11:12,341 --> 00:11:16,341
and on top of it all, he set the dog on fire.

199
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:19,741
But, later, when the daughter came back to life,

200
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:21,841
after hearing that the dog had actually come to her rescue

201
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:25,041
when she was lost and fell in the mountains,

202
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,441
the owner who regretted what he did,

203
00:11:27,441 --> 00:11:30,141
built a fine grave for the dog.

204
00:11:30,141 --> 00:11:32,671
However, several days later, a fire occurred

205
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:35,941
and only the owner couldn't escape in time and died.

206
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:38,241
Since then, word went around that the Inubushi family

207
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:40,241
was cursed by a demon dog engulfed in flames.

208
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,241
It's like a story of long ago.

209
00:11:43,241 --> 00:11:46,041
Then, does that grave actually exist?

210
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,141
Yes.

211
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:50,689
Under the cliff that your car almost fell from this afternoon.

212
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:53,541
Would you like me to take you there right now?

213
00:11:56,241 --> 00:11:57,641
True.

214
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:59,941
The gallant beloved dog of the Inubushi family.

215
00:11:59,941 --> 00:12:03,141
"Fusataro" lies here, it says.

216
00:12:03,141 --> 00:12:06,341
So if a dog engulfed in fire appears,

217
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:07,941
it's understandable that anybody would think

218
00:12:07,941 --> 00:12:09,441
it's the curse of Fusataro.

219
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:12,711
We'd better offer our prayers so that it won't curse us!

220
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:13,941
Same here.

221
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,241
There could never be such a thing as a curse.

222
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:20,341
Is the cliff that Keiji fell over this cliff?

223
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:22,341
Yes.

224
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,241
Right above this grave.

225
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,441
Saki?

226
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,041
Get a hold of yourself, Saki!

227
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:44,743
Saki, you mean the last of the adopted children?

228
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:47,741
Dog... burned.

229
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:49,741
Burned dog?

230
00:12:49,741 --> 00:12:52,441
Kazuha! Call the ambulance and the police!

231
00:12:52,441 --> 00:12:54,141
We'll go together with Pops Kogoro by car

232
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:55,141
to the top of the cliff!

233
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,541
What? You mean you want only us girls to wait here

234
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:58,757
in a place like this?

235
00:12:58,941 --> 00:13:00,541
If you want to go to the top of the cliff,

236
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,241
it's faster to take the animal path up, than by car.

237
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,141
Okay, take us there then!

238
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:08,241
Ran, wait here with Pops Kogoro and the others then!

239
00:13:08,241 --> 00:13:10,241
Okay.

240
00:13:13,441 --> 00:13:15,641
Okay! Off to the top of the cliff!

241
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:23,941
It's burning.

242
00:13:23,941 --> 00:13:26,241
There's no smell of oil.

243
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:33,441
It looks almost like a dog on fire walked through here.

244
00:13:33,441 --> 00:13:34,793
Yeah.

245
00:13:41,342 --> 00:13:44,242
Footprints that were on fire?

246
00:13:44,242 --> 00:13:47,842
You're saying that you found something like that up on the cliff?

247
00:13:47,842 --> 00:13:49,542
Yeah, that's right.

248
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:51,842
20m in the foreground from the edge of the cliff,

249
00:13:51,842 --> 00:13:54,242
there were traces of fire here and there.

250
00:13:54,242 --> 00:13:57,842
Just as if a demon dog engulfed in flames ran through the area.

251
00:13:57,842 --> 00:13:59,242
What?

252
00:13:59,242 --> 00:14:02,542
But, you didn't get to see the demon dog in question, did you?

253
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,842
I'll bet somebody just poured oil over the area

254
00:14:04,842 --> 00:14:07,642
and set fire to make it look like a demon dog really exists!

255
00:14:07,642 --> 00:14:10,829
No. There wasn't any smell of oil.

256
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:12,831
The space between the fire was greater

257
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:14,833
the closer you got to the edge of the cliff too,

258
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,835
and the fire got bigger too,

259
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:19,142
so it looked like something that was burning pass through there

260
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:20,842
as it got bigger.

261
00:14:20,842 --> 00:14:22,841
Isn't that right, Miyuki?

262
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:23,942
Yes.

263
00:14:23,942 --> 00:14:27,742
So the cursed demon dog...

264
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,842
Does exist after all.

265
00:14:29,842 --> 00:14:31,542
Saki who fell from the cliff said,

266
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:33,742
"Dog engulfed in flames" too.

267
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:34,853
Idiot!

268
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,942
There could be no such thing as a demon dog in this world!

269
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:39,442
It's a trick!

270
00:14:39,442 --> 00:14:43,742
Somebody's just trying to make it look as if a demon dog exists!

271
00:14:43,742 --> 00:14:46,865
In order to put the blame on the demon dog for their crime.

272
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:49,742
Exactly!

273
00:14:49,742 --> 00:14:51,242
I mean this is a time when the world is talking about

274
00:14:51,242 --> 00:14:52,871
TV broadcasts going digital,

275
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:55,742
how can you possibly make us fuss over a demon dog?

276
00:14:55,742 --> 00:14:57,542
It's really making me "dizzy dear".

277
00:14:57,542 --> 00:14:59,742
Inspector Yamamura!

278
00:14:59,742 --> 00:15:05,342
Oh, did you catch on to the play on words I just mentioned?

279
00:15:05,342 --> 00:15:06,885
Who's this chum?

280
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:08,887
He's an officer from the Gunma Prefectural Police Station,

281
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:09,942
although he may not look it.

282
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,891
So, this is Gunma Prefecture.

283
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:14,542
And...

284
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:16,895
how is Saki who fell off the cliff doing?

285
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:21,442
Well, I heard that she was taken by ambulance to a hospital.

286
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:23,542
That's our hospital.

287
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:26,442
I got a call on my cell phone

288
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:28,907
and was told she died in the ambulance.

289
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:31,442
Oh, no.

290
00:15:31,442 --> 00:15:34,913
I don't know who's manipulating the demon dog

291
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:36,242
but it's definite that somebody's

292
00:15:36,242 --> 00:15:38,642
picking a fight with the Inubushi family.

293
00:15:38,642 --> 00:15:41,942
That's true. Out of all the eight adopted children,

294
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,923
half of us, four have already died.

295
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:48,242
Then, for the time being, out of the four that now remain,

296
00:15:48,242 --> 00:15:51,842
will the three of you who are here give us your alibis?

297
00:15:51,842 --> 00:15:54,442
Tell us where and what you were doing around 19:00

298
00:15:54,442 --> 00:15:56,935
when Saki fell over the cliff.

299
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:59,742
Miyuki has a concrete alibi because she was with us

300
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:01,642
when we went to look at the grave of the dog

301
00:16:01,642 --> 00:16:04,242
located below the cliff!

302
00:16:04,242 --> 00:16:07,842
At about 19:00, I was taking a bath.

303
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:10,642
Since Saki didn't come back for a while,

304
00:16:10,642 --> 00:16:12,642
I went outside to check on her.

305
00:16:12,642 --> 00:16:15,942
She still loses her way a lot even now so...

306
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:19,342
I was beside mother checking her body temperature,

307
00:16:19,342 --> 00:16:22,961
blood pressure and feeding her liquid food.

308
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:25,542
Well, but since she's bed-ridden.

309
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:29,442
I can't have her testify for me, though.

310
00:16:29,442 --> 00:16:30,969
As for you two,

311
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:33,742
you don't seem to have anyone who can testify for you either.

312
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:34,973
No.

313
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:38,242
Normally there are three people helping me,

314
00:16:38,242 --> 00:16:40,979
but they've taken leave to visit their families.

315
00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:44,142
Mr. Mouri! It's the job of the police to ask that question!

316
00:16:44,142 --> 00:16:46,742
Please don't take my job away from me!

317
00:16:46,742 --> 00:16:50,442
Oh, isn't he a police officer?

318
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:53,842
Oh, no. I lost the chance to introduce myself.

319
00:16:53,842 --> 00:16:56,995
His name is Kogoro Mouri.

320
00:16:56,995 --> 00:16:58,997
-Mou... -Mouri?

321
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:00,442
Kogoro?

322
00:17:00,442 --> 00:17:03,542
Are you the renown Detective Kogoro Mouri?

323
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:05,842
Yes, well...

324
00:17:05,842 --> 00:17:09,007
Huh? The atmosphere's changed.

325
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:11,742
You just surprised us a bit.

326
00:17:11,742 --> 00:17:15,642
Before he left the house, the late Shinichi said...

327
00:17:15,642 --> 00:17:17,842
You'd better give yourselves up

328
00:17:17,842 --> 00:17:19,742
because he asked an acquaintance police officer to investigate

329
00:17:19,742 --> 00:17:21,019
and to solve the mystery

330
00:17:21,242 --> 00:17:23,742
of what is happening in the Inubushi family.

331
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,942
But I had no idea that it was going to be

332
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:29,027
the renown Sleeping Kogoro.

333
00:17:29,242 --> 00:17:32,542
Well, I'm the one who actually asked to investigate the incident.

334
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:34,442
By the way, the day Shinichi

335
00:17:34,442 --> 00:17:37,042
was killed in his residence in Tokyo,

336
00:17:37,042 --> 00:17:41,042
I suppose there's no one here that went to Tokyo, is there?

337
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:43,942
All four of us were in Tokyo.

338
00:17:45,742 --> 00:17:49,542
We went to persuade him to come back to the Inubushi family.

339
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:53,042
It seemed that he suspected one of us,

340
00:17:53,042 --> 00:17:55,053
so we wanted to ask him why he thought so too.

341
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:58,842
Well, but he was so afraid that he didn't tell us anything.

342
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:03,342
It was as if he was saying that the culprit is among us.

343
00:18:03,342 --> 00:18:05,642
We heard about Shinichi's death

344
00:18:05,642 --> 00:18:08,242
as soon as we got back from Saki who we asked

345
00:18:08,242 --> 00:18:09,842
to keep watch over the answer phone.

346
00:18:09,842 --> 00:18:11,069
Which means that all four of you

347
00:18:11,242 --> 00:18:13,442
were together all the while you were in Tokyo?

348
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:18,242
No. We all went together, but we all came back separately.

349
00:18:18,242 --> 00:18:21,342
By the way, isn't it about time you tell us

350
00:18:21,342 --> 00:18:24,642
about what you found out about Shinichi's case?

351
00:18:24,642 --> 00:18:27,542
You also mentioned that the accident of Keiji and Miwako

352
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:29,342
that occurred previously had some connection

353
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,342
with the chain of events that is happening too.

354
00:18:31,342 --> 00:18:33,942
We don't know yet if this has any connection to the incident,

355
00:18:33,942 --> 00:18:37,095
but Shinichi had the pearl that

356
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:40,742
was on his necktie pin in his mouth!

357
00:18:42,742 --> 00:18:44,142
What seems to be the matter?

358
00:18:44,142 --> 00:18:50,442
Oh, nothing. There was one near Keiji who fell over the cliff like Saki.

359
00:18:50,442 --> 00:18:52,242
A pachinko ball.

360
00:18:52,242 --> 00:18:53,842
A pachinko ball?

361
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:56,842
That old man used to love playing pachinko

362
00:18:56,842 --> 00:18:59,742
so I though t it just fell out of his pocket or something.

363
00:18:59,742 --> 00:19:01,542
Besides, after that,

364
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:05,742
even on the surface of the swamp that Miwako drowned in,

365
00:19:05,742 --> 00:19:07,642
there was a ping pong ball.

366
00:19:07,642 --> 00:19:10,342
Balls, balls and more balls.

367
00:19:10,342 --> 00:19:14,042
So, the pearl is not a dying message.

368
00:19:14,042 --> 00:19:17,742
It seems to be a message that the culprit deliberately left behind!

369
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:22,242
-Then, maybe... -That's the same too?

370
00:19:23,142 --> 00:19:26,842
We found it after Saki was taken to the hospital in the ambulance.

371
00:19:26,842 --> 00:19:30,442
It was rolling on the ground near the dog's grave, a marble!

372
00:19:30,442 --> 00:19:31,842
A marble?

373
00:19:31,842 --> 00:19:33,442
Do you have that with you now?

374
00:19:33,442 --> 00:19:37,155
We thought it was an offering, so we left it on the grave.

375
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,142
Okay, we'll go take a look at that marble,

376
00:19:40,142 --> 00:19:42,342
so will you come with us too, officer?

377
00:19:42,342 --> 00:19:44,142
I've got some things I'd like to ask you too.

378
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:45,642
Yeah.

379
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,142
Kazuha and the rest of you, stay still and wait here!

380
00:19:48,142 --> 00:19:49,642
Ran, you too!

381
00:19:49,642 --> 00:19:51,742
What? We'll go with you too!

382
00:19:51,742 --> 00:19:53,742
We're the ones who found it, after all!

383
00:19:53,742 --> 00:19:55,173
You can come if you want!

384
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:57,175
If you want to see the demon dog!

385
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:59,542
I... I guess not.

386
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:01,179
We'll wait here.

387
00:20:04,942 --> 00:20:08,142
I... I'm sorry to have barged in on you like this,

388
00:20:08,142 --> 00:20:10,642
and yet to be served dinner.

389
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,842
No problem, don't worry about it.

390
00:20:12,842 --> 00:20:16,142
I wonder if Heiji and the others will be back before dawn?

391
00:20:16,142 --> 00:20:17,642
I wonder.

392
00:20:17,642 --> 00:20:20,542
More than that, we're really going to have it tough from now on

393
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:25,203
since Saki was the one who made preparations

394
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:28,242
and put things away most of the time.

395
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:33,542
Can I help you with something?

396
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:37,215
Then, could you go feed Hachi for me?

397
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:39,217
Okay.

398
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:43,221
I asked Takako and the others to do it, but they refused.

399
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:45,242
Why?

400
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:48,442
It seems that Takako is used to the dog and yet?

401
00:20:48,442 --> 00:20:52,942
Yes. It seems that she had a dog before she came here,

402
00:20:52,942 --> 00:20:54,742
so she knows a lot but...

403
00:20:54,742 --> 00:20:56,142
it seems she's got her hands full with

404
00:20:56,142 --> 00:20:58,742
making arrangements for the funeral and all.

405
00:20:58,742 --> 00:21:01,842
Tomoaki had been bitten by a dog in the past

406
00:21:01,842 --> 00:21:03,241
and really hates dogs!

407
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:07,245
Since he's always jittery, Hachi really barks at him too.

408
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:09,542
And Yoshiya's allergic to dogs.

409
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:11,842
When near dogs, he can't stop sneezing

410
00:21:11,842 --> 00:21:14,442
and comes down with runny nose, he says.

411
00:21:14,442 --> 00:21:19,257
That's why it used to be Takako, Saki or I who fed the dog.

412
00:21:19,442 --> 00:21:22,442
-Could I ask you to do it for me? -Okay! Sure!

413
00:21:22,442 --> 00:21:25,542
Where's the doghouse?

414
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:27,742
It's a bit far away.

415
00:21:27,742 --> 00:21:31,042
Far? Don't tell me that it's outside the house?

416
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:33,742
Don't worry! It's towards the edge of house,

417
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:37,742
but it's fenced in so even the demon dog can't go inside!

418
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:40,342
Oh, I see.

419
00:21:47,042 --> 00:21:49,542
Boy, it sure is a large yard.

420
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:51,289
Yes.

421
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,293
Isn't that it, the doghouse?

422
00:21:55,542 --> 00:21:58,342
Right! Hachi's there too!

423
00:22:00,142 --> 00:22:03,301
Hachi! We brought you dinner!

424
00:22:05,303 --> 00:22:07,305
Eat it all now!

425
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:09,742
-He's so cute! -Yes!

426
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:12,742
It'd be nice if the demon dog is this way too.

427
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:21,319
What's the matter?

428
00:22:24,442 --> 00:22:25,742
What's that?

429
00:22:25,742 --> 00:22:28,242
Isn't there something glowing over there?

430
00:22:28,242 --> 00:22:29,327
Yes.

431
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,421
Next Conan's Hint:

432
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,010
"Onions"

433
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,058
What will come out if you peel an onion?

434
00:24:08,058 --> 00:24:09,427
Nothing's going to come out.

435
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:10,940
Tears are.
