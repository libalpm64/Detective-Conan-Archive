1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,680
Alibis, secret codes, tricks, deals.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,880
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,780
An unthinkable impossible crime has been committed.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,680
There's got to be a clue somewhere.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,180
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,380
A child in appearance with the I.Q of an adult.

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,080
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,390
Pops and I went to drop Sonoko and Ran off

9
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,890
at a snowy mountain lodge

10
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,790
in order for them to participate in an off the net gathering.

11
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,490
On the way back home, we hear the news over the car radio

12
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,590
that Mr. Tsutomu Nishiyama, the board leader of the Magic Lovers' Group

13
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,890
was murdered in his apartment.

14
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,490
Moreover, words hinting that there will be serial killings

15
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,290
were left at the scene.

16
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,390
In front of our very eyes, as we rushed back to Ran and the others,

17
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,590
the suspended bridge was up in flames as if to block our path.

18
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,490
I somehow make it back to the lodge alone,

19
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,790
but because of fever from my cold, I get very sick.

20
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,390
And, unfortunately,

21
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,690
another victim turned up.

22
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,990
It can't be.

23
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,490
What's wrong, Mr. Hamano?

24
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,990
Don't come.

25
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,690
It's no use. He's already dead.

26
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,690
Oh, no.

27
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,790
Besides, we don't want to mess the scene up anymore than it already is.

28
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,190
The scene?

29
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,290
Can't you tell?

30
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,590
The corpse is more than 10m away from the lodge,

31
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,590
and the only footprints left are those of the man who just ran up to him.

32
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,590
But then...

33
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,190
Right. This is a crime that couldn't have been committed

34
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,890
unless the murderer had wings.

35
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,090
This is an impossible crime!

36
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:31,990
"The Magic Lovers' Murder Case (Part 2)"

37
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,590
Impossible crime?

38
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,690
But, why Mr. Hamano?

39
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,590
Why was he killed?

40
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,890
I don't know the reason yet.

41
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,490
All I can say for now is he died of strangulation.

42
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,490
Somebody choked Mr. Hamano with a thin string or something

43
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,990
and killed him,

44
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,890
then, somehow brought him here.

45
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,590
It has to be somebody who is near the vicinity of this lodge.

46
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,890
What?

47
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,990
Hey...

48
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,590
Are you saying that the killer is among us?

49
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,990
No, not really.

50
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,590
But, we're the only ones here, aren't we?

51
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,690
No.

52
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,990
There is another suspect.

53
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,290
What?

54
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:25,590
I feel that it is very likely that he is hiding somewhere.

55
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,690
Who are you referring to?

56
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,590
How strange... you are already forgotten?

57
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,790
One of the members of the Magic Lovers' Group

58
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,590
who was supposed to have come here to spend the night,

59
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,890
"Shadow".

60
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,390
I see. That's possible.

61
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,590
Besides, a message suggesting the possibility seems to have been left

62
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,790
on the computer near Mr. Nishiyama's corpse too.

63
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,990
Are you saying that he may be somewhere now,

64
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,890
waiting for a chance to kill us?

65
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,290
You've gotta be kidding!

66
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,990
Wait, Ms. Tanaka.

67
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,490
Ms. Tanaka. What's the matter?

68
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,890
I am going home.

69
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,090
I'm leaving this lodge where a killer may be hiding,

70
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,690
right this minute!

71
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,090
You can't go home.

72
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,490
-What? -When I came back here,

73
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,190
the suspended bridge was already set on fire by someone.

74
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,190
What? We can't get down to the foot of the mountain

75
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,790
without that suspended bridge.

76
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,490
Don't tell me that the killer severed the phone line too.

77
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,590
We can still use the cellular phone.

78
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,890
Oh.

79
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,590
No good.

80
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,790
This place is out of range and the cellular won't connect.

81
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,190
In other words, the killer has completely cut us off

82
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,890
from the world below.

83
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,490
Oh, no.

84
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,590
You figured out the identity of "Shadow"?

85
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,290
Are you serious, Inspector?

86
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,590
Yeah, I can't say who he is at the moment

87
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,690
but we found that he is a member of the Magic Lovers' Group.

88
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,390
Then, you can find out who he is by his I.D.

89
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,490
We checked,

90
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,090
but the person was completely unrelated with this case.

91
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,390
Completely unrelated?

92
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,390
Yeah.

93
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,490
He had nothing to do with magic.

94
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:12,190
Besides, he hasn't touched his computer for the last two years.

95
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:16,290
In other words, somebody has been using his password and I.D. number

96
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:20,790
and going the internet as "Shadow".

97
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:24,390
But, that's not the only problem.

98
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,490
Huh?

99
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:33,190
There is another suspicious person among those in that lodge

100
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:38,190
who is using the internet with a mysterious I.D. number.

101
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,490
I wonder if it's my fault.

102
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,090
Because I'm the one who picked Mr. Hamano

103
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,390
as the one in charge of entertainment tonight.

104
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,190
If Mr. Hamano didn't go up to his room alone,

105
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,690
he probably wouldn't have been killed.

106
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,590
Just because I chose him, Mr. Hamano...

107
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,390
Sonoko.

108
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,790
Don't worry yourself over it.

109
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,990
You were blindfolded

110
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,790
and marked the sheets at random back then, that's all you did.

111
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:18,790
You don't hold a grudge against the person who shoots the arrow

112
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,590
to pick the winning lottery, do you?

113
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,690
It's the same as that.

114
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:27,790
All you did was help Mr. Hamano with his magic.

115
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:31,490
You have no reason to worry yourself over it, do you?

116
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,290
No.

117
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,290
Help him out with his magic?

118
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,990
Are we going to be all right,

119
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,090
just waiting here like this till help arrives?

120
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,290
We'll be fine.

121
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,890
When the bridge burned down,

122
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,190
Pops said from the other end of the bridge,

123
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,990
"I will get the police right away,"

124
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,190
"so stay put and wait at the lodge."

125
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,990
I am sure that he'll come with the police to rescue us

126
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,890
as soon as day breaks.

127
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,090
I hope so.

128
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:04,190
But, if the killer is "Shadow"...

129
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,690
Maybe he's doing this because of the "chat" we had

130
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,890
the other day after all?

131
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,990
What's a... "chat"?

132
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:16,290
A "chat" is when many people communicate real time on the computer

133
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,890
using the phone line.

134
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,890
We communicate by typing out what we want to say,

135
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,790
and that in turn is displayed the screen.

136
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,190
But, why would that have anything to do with murder?

137
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,990
Remember, I told you that

138
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,390
they got into an argument over some magician.

139
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,790
I wonder if you know,

140
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,890
an elderly magician by the name of Fuden Harui,

141
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,990
who used to be called "Japan's Escape King".

142
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,790
Oh, is he the one who passed away last month

143
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,890
when he was performing because of an accident?

144
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,790
Yes. When we were talking about that accident,

145
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:53,490
"Shadow" suddenly made a weird remark and said,

146
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:58,390
"That great magician died because of you guys."

147
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,690
What did he mean?

148
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,390
6 months ago, we got carried away talking about

149
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,290
the "Escape Show" that was popular some years ago.

150
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,690
Just when we were hoping that someone would do it again,

151
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,090
he got into an accident.

152
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:16,690
"Shadow" insists it happened because we talked about it.

153
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,590
That's nothing but unjustified resentment.

154
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,590
I was concerned,

155
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,690
so I reconfirmed with Mr. Nishiyama, the board leader.

156
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,190
But we concluded that there was no one

157
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,190
who could've been Mr. Harui talking with us in chat 6 months ago.

158
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,890
But, we can never be sure whether the one

159
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,990
using the I.D. is actually who he's supposed to be.

160
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:37,690
Or somebody could've shown him the record of the chat.

161
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:42,390
That's why I planned this off the net gathering with Mr. Nishiyama.

162
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,690
We thought it'd be faster to have all the people

163
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,090
who participated in the chat 6 months ago to come here

164
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:51,490
-so we could see for ourselves. -Oh, I see.

165
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,890
But, wasn't it only recently that "Shadow" became a member?

166
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,590
How does he know of what went on 6 months ago?

167
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,690
Yeah, we invited "Shadow" to come

168
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,090
because we wanted to ask him directly

169
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,190
and get rid of any misunderstanding.

170
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,990
"Shadow" always used to say...

171
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:13,590
"I can fly through the air and make myself disappear."

172
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,190
Hey, that's...

173
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,790
Yes.

174
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,590
If the killer is "Shadow",

175
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,190
he would've carried out his performance

176
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,290
by committing the impossible crime.

177
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,190
He's putting on a performance of a bloody magic show

178
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,590
right before our eyes.

179
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,490
It's getting cold.

180
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:37,590
I think I'll go get something to slip on.

181
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,190
Oh, I'll go too, then.

182
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,590
I want to go get a sweater or something for him to wear.

183
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,990
I'll go too, then.

184
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,090
The more, the safer.

185
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,090
What a bummer, needing to get jittery even to enter a room.

186
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,490
I don't want to wear something so baggy.

187
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,790
Hey, don't move.

188
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:10,390
What was that about Sonoko helping out with the magic?

189
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,890
Something about Mr. Hamano

190
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,790
deciding by magic what everyone should do.

191
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,090
By magic?

192
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:21,090
Yes, and the temporary leader turned out to be Ms. Kuroda.

193
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,990
Ms. Tanaka had to make the bath.

194
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:27,090
The one in charge of entertainment turned out to be Mr. Hamano.

195
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,390
Which means that

196
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,790
Mr. Hamano went up to his room alone

197
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,590
because he was picked to the one in charge of entertainment?

198
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:36,490
Yep. It seems he was thinking up some magic in his room.

199
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,290
What were the others doing then?

200
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,890
I wonder. Everybody had something to do.

201
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,590
Hurry, Ran.

202
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,090
Because God knows where "Shadow" may be stalking us.

203
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,490
I'm sorry.

204
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:55,590
"Shadow", I wonder if he's really the killer.

205
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,490
Nobody has seen him yet.

206
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,590
Besides, everybody's alibi is not all that clear either.

207
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,790
At any rate, the killer

208
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,890
is planning to confine us here, and still do something.

209
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,590
But, I won't let him have his way.

210
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:14,090
If he is planning another murder, then more so...

211
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,790
What was that?

212
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,790
An arrow suddenly came flying.

213
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,590
No.

214
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,190
Who is it? Come out here!

215
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,490
-Don't! -Get away from the window!

216
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,890
What was that?

217
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,990
Sonoko?

218
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,190
Darn!

219
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,890
Sonoko? Where's Sonoko?

220
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,790
She went to the ladies room with Ms. Kuroda.

221
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,990
What's wrong?

222
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,290
The window. We heard the window cracking in the bathroom,

223
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,390
so Sonoko looked in.

224
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,890
There is an arrow poked through the mirror.

225
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,990
It came from that window, eh?

226
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,090
Somebody from outside is trying to take our lives.

227
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,590
You've gotta be kidding. I've had enough.

228
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,390
Oh, please wait, Ms. Tanaka!

229
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,990
Ms. Tanaka!

230
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,790
Don't go outside!

231
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,390
I don't know who the heck you are.

232
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:19,890
But, why don't you stop hiding like a coward and come on out?

233
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:23,790
Hey, look. There are footprints all over the woods.

234
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,390
So, someone's hiding after all.

235
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,390
Oh, no.

236
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,090
Be careful.

237
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,590
Ms. Tanaka.

238
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,390
Are you all right?

239
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,590
Why do we have to go through something like this?

240
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,090
Why?

241
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:48,590
Hey. Isn't that a bow gun?

242
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,590
Now we know for sure.

243
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:57,090
That the killer is someone other than all of us here.

244
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,090
It's lucky that

245
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:03,790
the killer let go of his bow gun before anyone else got hurt.

246
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,690
Darn.

247
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,480
This off the net gathering is the pits.

248
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,780
I shouldn't have come here.

249
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,080
Oh, I don't think the gathering is to blame.

250
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,180
I guess you guys don't mind,

251
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,680
but I was directly almost killed by that bow gun.

252
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,680
Do you know how I feel?

253
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,680
Well, let's go back to the lodge, shall we?

254
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,880
It's dangerous out here.

255
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,180
I guess so.

256
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,480
Poor Mr. Hamano.

257
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,180
He's going to be left all alone out in the snow.

258
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,280
Maybe we should put sheets or something over him.

259
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,680
No.

260
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,080
No footprints around the corpse on the snow

261
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,480
is clear proof that this was an impossible crime to commit.

262
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,480
We shouldn't mar that beautiful piece of art

263
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,980
with needless footprints.

264
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,880
-Piece of art, what's with you? -Cold...

265
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,780
Hey, isn't this the arrow of the bow gun?

266
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:21,280
Then, was that meant for me?

267
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,280
If we were unlucky, we could've been shot by it too.

268
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,680
Let's all go back to the lodge, everyone.

269
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,480
The snow that has piled up on the branches

270
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,180
have fallen to the ground only around this big tree.

271
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,780
Why?

272
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,980
It's a hole.

273
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,780
There is a brand new hole in the trunk of the tree.

274
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,480
I wonder if somebody opened it now just for fun.

275
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,880
Or...

276
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,980
did somebody who is loitering around here open it?

277
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,980
If so, why...

278
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,280
The guy who's been acting pretty strange

279
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,580
since a while ago smells fishy.

280
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,880
Katsuki Doito.

281
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,580
What was I doing when Mr. Hamano was killed?

282
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,480
I was asleep then so I want to know.

283
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,280
What good is it going to do you?

284
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,580
I get it.

285
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,780
You think that the killer is among us, don't you?

286
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,680
But, sonny, the arrow came flying in from outside

287
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,480
and, the bow gun was found in the woods.

288
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,280
No matter how you look at, somebody other than us,

289
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,280
an outsider is trying to kill us...

290
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,180
But, nobody saw the killer, right?

291
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,980
I think it's too soon to jump to conclusions yet.

292
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,280
-Conan. -Yes,

293
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,680
we may as well get things straight while we're at it.

294
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,280
Mr. Hamano was killed

295
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,280
while he was in the room all alone, right?

296
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,880
At that time,

297
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,980
I was setting the table together with Ms. Kuroda

298
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,180
and getting ready for entertainment time.

299
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,080
Right, Ms. Kuroda?

300
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,280
Yes. After we set the table,

301
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,280
I went to the kitchen and helped Mr. Sugama.

302
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,780
I was making the snacks Mr. Ara asked me prepare.

303
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,580
When Ms. Kuroda and Mr. Sugama were in the kitchen,

304
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,480
what were you doing, Mr. Doito?

305
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,080
Yeah, I went to the room to get some firecrackers

306
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,580
for entertainment time.

307
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,480
Oh... fire crackers.

308
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,280
I went to the room Ran was in

309
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,480
to check on how Conan was doing, right?

310
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,380
Yes, and since Sonoko asked me

311
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,980
to come down for entertainment time,

312
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,580
we left Conan in the room and came down to the living room.

313
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,880
I went to the wine cellar to pick up some wine.

314
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,580
I went to burn firewood for the bath

315
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,780
because I was picked as Bath person.

316
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,380
Do you know how long that took?

317
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,880
Well, maybe it took about 7 to 8 minutes.

318
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,080
I think that's about right.

319
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,180
But, I can't recall the exact time it took.

320
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,580
-Approximately 8 minutes. -Huh?

321
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,880
I was using the oven till Mr. Ara got back.

322
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,180
But, would it really take 8 minutes to go get wine?

323
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,180
I had completely forgotten that I changed locks of the wine cellar,

324
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,280
and went back to my room to get the key.

325
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,980
A new key?

326
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,880
Would you like to see it for yourself?

327
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,080
See, the top are the newly installed keys.

328
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,880
Really, it has a lot of keys on it.

329
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,580
Why are they so many locks on the door?

330
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,180
Just the other day a thief broke into the cellar.

331
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,180
That's why I got more keys.

332
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,080
The only valuables I have around here

333
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,780
is this wine cellar, so...

334
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,180
Is that the door to the kitchen?

335
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,580
Yeah.

336
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,480
There are many footprints around it.

337
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,380
When I got here, we all went once around the lodge.

338
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,980
So, maybe that's how they got there?

339
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,080
All right, sonny, that's enough, isn't it?

340
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,580
-Let's hurry on inside. -While we're at it,

341
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,980
could I see the place where you burn firewood for the bath?

342
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,780
Hey, hey.

343
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,980
This is the place where firewood is burned to make the bath.

344
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,680
There doesn't seem to be much snow on the eaves.

345
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,380
Yeah, it gets warm when you burn firewood for the bath

346
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,880
so the snow slides off.

347
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,780
What window is that?

348
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,480
It's the window on the 2nd floor at the end of the corridor.

349
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,180
Then if you climb up the stairs,

350
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,580
you get to go upstairs, right, Ms. Tanaka?

351
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,980
Conan.

352
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,080
I guess so.

353
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,080
But, I'm not the only one who could've climbed up there.

354
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,280
I went to look in on the temperature of the bath water

355
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,780
2 or 3 times.

356
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,180
Hey. Just what do you mean by that?

357
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,980
I'm just saying that if anyone came here when I wasn't around,

358
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,780
anybody could've climbed up.

359
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,280
-I didn't. -The arrow of the bow gun

360
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,080
was shot through the window of that bathroom

361
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,880
and Ms. Tanaka's room right above it.

362
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,980
If the killer shot the arrow,

363
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,080
he would've done so from the woods

364
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,580
that we all were at a while ago but...

365
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,980
Something's not right.

366
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,980
The killer shooting the arrow into Ms. Tanaka' room

367
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,080
because a silhouetted figure can be seen through the window,

368
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,080
but why would he shoot through the bathroom window?

369
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,180
Hey, this is a staple.

370
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,580
Why would something like this be in a place like this?

371
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,880
Don't tell me that...

372
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,780
It could be that...

373
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,980
How's your investigation coming along, little detective?

374
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,880
Oh, well, so-so.

375
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,480
Hey, everybody's gone inside already.

376
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,380
You're always skittering here and there,

377
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,280
so we can't take our eyes off you.

378
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,380
Go.

379
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,880
Sonoko.

380
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,680
Please tell me the details of when Mr. Hamano decided

381
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,480
what chores everyone should do.

382
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,580
Huh?

383
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,480
I see.

384
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,680
I'm starting to get the picture of this case.

385
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,880
There is only one thing left to figure out.

386
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,980
The impossible crime.

387
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:24,480
I won't be able to corner the killer unless I solve that mystery.

388
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,680
How was it done anyway?

389
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,880
There are no footprints anywhere in the snow,

390
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,780
10m away from the corpse.

391
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,980
Doing something like that is impossible

392
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,280
unless the corpse is dropped from a crane or something.

393
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,580
There would at least have to be a pillar near the corpse.

394
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,780
Otherwise, there's no way it can be done.

395
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,580
How about some wine? It'll warm you up.

396
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,780
Drinking at this time of night?

397
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,880
It wouldn't hurt to drink a bit, would it?

398
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,180
It'll help us refresh a bit.

399
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,780
I see. So, that's what it is.

400
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,680
That's why the killer burned the suspended bridge down

401
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,480
and cut us off from the world below.

402
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,780
I've figured it out completely.

403
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,180
The trick used to carry out the impossible crime.

404
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:30,180
As well as the one who carried it out.
